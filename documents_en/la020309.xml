<HD>Original Blast</HD>
<DH>Fueled by a compilation release of their classic rock
songs, the Blasters, including the volatile Alvin brothers--Dave and
Phil--reunite on stage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Brothers Grimace are back together on stage for the first time in
17 years, and even if it's for a limited engagement, it's been a
welcome jolt for a certain breed of Southern California rock fans.</LD>
<LD>   Here they were at the Galaxy Theatre in Santa Ana on Thursday, the
original Blasters--singer Phil Alvin with his face stretched into
that trademark death-mask grin, his brother Dave contorting his
features with the exertion of his guitar fusillades.</LD>
<LD>   These are the visual accessories to one of the defining sounds of
Los Angeles rock, the rock-solid, poetry-smart music the Blasters
unleashed in their early-'80s heyday. Long out of print, their
classic records have just been released on a Rhino Records two-CD
compilation, "Testament: The Complete Slash Recordings."</LD>
<TE>   The collection has generated something few fans thought would ever
happen--a reunion of the original lineup, which ended when Dave and
pianist Gene Taylor left amid personal and career tensions in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   The Downey-bred Alvin brothers were as famous for their personal
battles as for their music (overshadowing the fact that all the guys
tended to mix it up, in various combinations), so when plans for the
reunion--also including Taylor, drummer Bill Bateman and bassist John
Bazz--were announced, the immediate question was whether it would
survive even its planned five-day span.</TE>
<TE>   Even Dave, now a prominent figure as a musician and producer in
the world of contemporary folk music, can joke about that.</TE>
<TE>   "All five of us grew up together, and to have this thing where we
don't play together is a little silly to a point," he said in his
dressing room before Thursday's show, "So this is OK, let's do this
and see if we can make it through five gigs without killing each
other."</TE>
<TE>   So far so good. The first show, Wednesday in San Diego, went well
by all accounts, and Thursday's Galaxy set (which set the stage for
Friday's scheduled Hollywood homecoming at the House of Blues) was
everything a Blasters fan could want: a no-nonsense race through the
songbook, fueled by the spirit and intensity that made the Blasters a
major force two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Starting with "Red Rose," from the 1983 album "Non Fiction," the
band quickly shook off any cobwebs and was instantly in high gear as
it coursed through its variations on rock 'n' roll fundamentals
("Long White Cadillac," "American Music," "So Long Baby Goodbye"),
some of Dave's incisive story songs ("Border Radio") and his
blue-collar social commentary ("Common Man").</TE>
<TE>   And there was the added sentiment and nostalgia that came with the
reunion, from the large photo on stage of the late Lee Allen, the
veteran New Orleans saxophonist who had been part of the Blasters, to
the visible pleasure on the players' faces as they interacted during
the show.</TE>
<TE>   "Without getting too teary-eyed," Dave said earlier, "I rarely see
Phil, both of our parents are gone now, you know. It's kind of like
goin' home a little bit ....</TE>
<TE>   "Whether there is or isn't an afterlife, my parents are pretty
happy right now. Lee Allen's pretty happy that we're doin' this at
least once. If that sounds sappy, Phil and I are a couple of sappy
guys."</TE>
<TE>   Of course they're also a couple of headstrong guys, and it
wouldn't be the Blasters if there weren't some issues. Phil Alvin
still leads a version of the Blasters, consisting of Bazz, guitarist
Keith Wyatt and drummer Jerry Angel. For him, the idea of playing
with the old band had limited appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "What bothers me the most is the ambiguous description of who the
Blasters are," the singer said, sitting in his own dressing room at
the Galaxy. "This is very much what I was worried about, and I still
am.... 'Is David here tonight? Is Phil here tonight?' It's
disheartening to play for people and have them think that they were
coming to see something else."</TE>
<TE>   But Phil's current mates encouraged him to go ahead, on the
premise that spreading the Blasters name could only do them good.</TE>
<TE>   For Dave, though, it's a matter of reclaiming that name.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons I'm glad this [CD] is coming out is I kind of
feel like the name of the band has been besmirched. I wish my brother
called his band the Phil Alvin Band. Because to me the Blasters were
these guys that are gonna be on stage and that's it.</TE>
<TE>   "Its been 17 years since I quit. There's people that have no idea
what the Blasters were.... I wanted to redeem the name of the band.
Now I'm gonna have a big fight with my brother for saying that."</TE>

<DH>A&amp;E's gorilla special gets an opposable thumbs up from
Koko, the first of her kind to learn sign language.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE FELDNER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"They're our bridge to the past. Without the great apes where are we?
We're fragments floating in the universe without a past, without a
future," says Dr. George Schaller in the A&amp;E special "Gorillas:
Primal Contact" airing Sunday night at 8. The show, narrated by
Martin Sheen and produced by Greystone Communications  in association
with the Bronx-based Wildlife Conservation Society, is itself a
rarity since it's about both captive and wild gorillas and man's
fascination with them.</LD>
<LD>   WCS' Congo Gorilla Forest, a $43-million exhibit in the heart of
New York's Bronx Zoo that took 10 years and 200 people to build, is
the hub of this special. Commentary from the society's gorilla
experts, including Schaller, the first to study wild gorillas in
1959, and Amy Vedder and Bill Weber (authors of the recently
published book "In the Kingdom of Gorilla"), offer insights into the
gorilla mind as well as anecdotes about living and working closely
with them.</LD>
<LD>   To get a different perspective on this special, we consulted
another kind of expert--a 280-pound lowland gorilla named Koko.
Opposable thumbs up or thumbs down?</LD>
<TE>   Koko, whose full name is Hanabi-Ko (Fireworks-Child in Japanese),
drew widespread attention more than 20 years ago, as the first
gorilla in the world to learn American Sign Language (Ameslan),
though not the first or only primate to do so. She's got her own Web
site. She's a city girl--born on July 4, 1971, in the San Francisco
Zoo--who knows more than 1,000 gestural words and uses signs to lie,
insult and rhyme. Her first school days at the zoo and then Stanford
University are chronicled in Francine Patterson's book "The Education
of Koko" (1981).</TE>
<TE>   With the permission of the Gorilla Foundation based in Woodside,
Calif., which is home to Koko and its director Patterson, Koko was
sent a copy of the A&amp;E special for her take on it. At times, Ameslan
can be limiting for Koko. For instance, there isn't a sign for "mind
blowing," though this never stops her--she makes up her own signs.
Patterson puts Koko's IQ between 70 and 95 on the human scale and
says she comprehends 2,000 words of spoken English.</TE>
<TE>   Gorilla Watches</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife Documentaries</TE>
<TE>   Koko is not shy about her preferences in entertainment. Her
favorite movie is "Free Willy," though this can change from week to
week. Like Steve Irwin, "The Crocodile Hunter," she is fixated on
crocodiles and alligators. However, a local travelogue that airs on
KCET called "California Gold" is her bliss. Patterson and her staff
are mystified by Koko's obsession with the show because it's so tame.
"She's just fascinated by the host, Huell Howser. We don't know what
it is about him or that show, but she gets very annoyed if anyone
blocks her view." In one episode of "California Gold," Patterson and
staff thought Koko might be reacting to shots of a geyser, but it was
Howser who captivated her, perhaps not that surprising because she
prefers the company of men to women.</TE>
<TE>   We also asked (via Patterson signing in Ameslan) Koko some
lifestyle questions. Keep in mind, as Patterson wrote in her book,
"There are marked contrasts between a way a statement is made in
English and the way it is made in sign language ... the written
translation of statements made in sign language has a stilted
telegraphic quality."</TE>
<TE>   Question: What do you like to do in your free time?</TE>
<TE>   Koko: Drink, fine, fine, free time, free, have time free, time,
chocolate mouth, from lipstick have--swallow, people, polite people
have, glasses take off. (Patterson breaks it down this way: 'Have
time to walk around freely, have more chocolate,' and 'take glasses
off people to wear herself.' She often does this when she gets a
chance and thinks she is really cool in glasses.)</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have you met gorillas in the wild, and what do you think of
them?</TE>
<TE>   A: Fine gorillas.</TE>
<TE>   TV is an integral part of her routine after lunch. As much as she
enjoys programs and movies, she thinks nothing of hitting the off
switch or fast forwarding through the parts she finds annoying or
boring. And Patterson explains, "Like a child, we shield her from
certain content on TV. In fact, in general we only allow her to watch
PBS."</TE>
<TE>   However, during the week of Sept. 11, live coverage was so
pervasive that Koko accidentally saw the explosions of the twin
towers and signed "Shame." Her comprehension that the explosion was
bad has convinced Patterson even more so that Koko is empathetic. As
Vedder, who has lived intimately with wild gorillas, points out,
"They're intellectually curious; they're not coming up with
mathematics and philosophy [but] the more we look at it, the line
[that separates us] is not so clear as we thought."</TE>
<TE>   Koko's screening of the A&amp;E special is one of the few exceptions
to the PBS viewing rule. Patterson says, "We got the videotape and
started to show it to Koko, but her attention was elsewhere." Koko
has personally met many of the world's greatest primatologists, such
as Schaller and Dian Fossey, who spent 18 years studying Rwanda's
mountain gorillas before she was murdered in 1985. Schaller and
Fossey are featured in the special that follows the fate of a
wild-born giant silverback gorilla named Timmy. Until recently, Timmy
lived in cement zoo enclosures at the Bronx Zoo before he and his
gorilla troop moved into the 6.5 acres Congo Gorilla Forest. The
troop's first steps from concrete to the grassy exhibit are
touchingly documented by the program.</TE>
<TE>   American Carl Akley first caught wild mountain gorillas on
celluloid. It was this footage that fueled Hollywood to create such
fearsome fantasies as "King Kong." This special offers rare glimpses
of Akley's footage and interviews with make-up artist Rick Baker, who
made the gorillas for "Mighty Joe Young," "Gorillas in the Mist" and
"King Kong" (1976). A long segment shows footage of Fossey working
with gorillas, as well as the making of difficult sequences of
"Gorillas in the Mist"-- Baker's biggest challenge as real gorillas
were intercut with fake ones.</TE>
<TE>   Since many of the segments show the grisly destruction of gorillas
in the bush, first in Akley's taxidermy for the American Museum of
Natural History in the early 1900s, and the current slaughter linked
to the bush meat trade, only certain segments of the special were
approved by Patterson for Koko's review.</TE>
<TE>   For Koko, TV watching is an interactive sport, including touching
the screen. Like many of us she snacks while watching (usually
greenery or fruit). During the shots where Timmy's troop is first
released and tumbles across the grass, Koko comments, "Good. Koko
love hurry there," she says pointing at the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Not Always Easy</TE>
<TE>   to Understand Koko</TE>
<TE>   During a long segment, about midway through the documentary where
Vedder, Weber and other WSC officials talk about the exhibit and
gorilla conservation, Koko signs, " Koko love, pick-fence."
"Pick-fence" is a term Koko uses to convey bad "gossip," or literally
a fence. Despite Patterson's thousands of hours working with Koko,
she wasn't sure whether Koko was referring to the structure of the
zoo exhibit or the scientists.</TE>
<TE>   When actress Sigourney Weaver appears on screen portraying a
terror-stricken Fossey in "Gorillas in the Mist" facing down a
charging gorilla, Koko signs to the on-screen Fossey, "Good, kiss,"
and kisses her finger and touches the TV screen. Given the fact that
the show intercuts shots of Fossey and Weaver, it wasn't surprising
that Koko would take the actress for the real thing. After all, it
had been 24 years since she had last seen Fossey in the flesh. Since
then Koko has seen numerous nature programs about wild gorillas. She
seems to enjoy them, particularly scenes where they are feeding
DeeAnn Draper, Patterson's assistant and gorilla caregiver.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the Fossey segment, Koko remarked, "Show movie,
chocolate time," and was quite ready to move on to another story or a
game of chase. When asked about her overall impression of the show,
Koko simply signed: "Good."</TE>
<TE>   "Gorillas: Primal Contact" airs Sunday night at 8 on A&amp;E. The
network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<HD>Gladly Giving Up a Few Pounds</HD>
<DH>Films* Robert Altman is just the latest example of
Hollywood players finding favorable working conditions in Britain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRITTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LONDON--That veteran pro- vocateur Robert Altman has been in fine
form recently, sounding off on several of his favorite topics with a
lack of tact bordering on the heroic. Promoting his Oscar-nominated
film "Gosford Park," which he shot in England, using a large cast of
mostly British actors, he has extolled the virtues of this country
and its dramatic talent.</LD>
<LD>   "English actors are unquestionably the best," he told a British
journalist. To another, he proclaimed: "I love British actors.
They're trained so well, and they have the right attitude." When I
visited him on the "Gosford Park" set last summer, he told me it was
the best experience of his directing career, which goes back more
than 40 years. He has since repeated the claim.</LD>
<LD>   One could dismiss all this as flattering courtesies for the
benefit of the British media, but Altman is no flatterer, and he has
also voiced more extreme opinions for the benefit of wider audiences.
He has returned recently to one of his pet peeves: Hollywood. "They
sell shoes, I make gloves. We're not in the same business," he said
to one interviewer. To another, he remarked: "I couldn't tell you the
name, right now, of a person who runs a major Hollywood studio." His
comments come at an odd time, given that he presumably hopes academy
members will award him a best director Oscar for "Gosford Park."</LD>
<TE>   As usual, Altman didn't just leave it at that. On a panel at the
Berlin Film Festival earlier this year, Altman remarked: "I'm proud
to say [President] Bush has never seen any of my films." In other
interviews, he has called Bush "embarrassing," adding: "I'd be happy
to stay here in England. There's nothing in America I'd miss at all."</TE>
<TE>   Well, Altman likes to ruffle feathers and nurse grudges. But he is
also among a handful of distinctive, indisputably great film
directors of the last half-century, and when he talks of the
conditions in which he does his work, attention must be paid. In
particular, his comments about the advantages of working in Britain
merit scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   It should be remembered that "Gosford Park," with its huge
ensemble cast, could never have been made in Hollywood with leading
American actors; its budget would have been prohibitive. But Altman
was able to commandeer the cream of Britain's acting
profession--distinguished names like Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon,
Alan Bates, Helen Mirren, Derek Jacobi and Eileen Atkins--and
compensate them in a way that would gladden the heart of a Marxist
economist.</TE>
<TE>   Altman paid the 16 "lead" actors in his ensemble the same fee. He
then paid all 24 "secondary" actors a lesser fee. (The film's total
budget was $13 million, so one sees how modest those fees were.) Each
cast member was on call every day of shooting. Some stellar actors,
known for technical acting brilliance effectively spent entire days
as extras, appearing in the background of scenes but speaking no
lines. They inhabited small, functional changing rooms at London's
Shepperton Studios and lined up with the crew at the lunch wagon.
Luxurious it wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   But as actor Richard E. Grant explained, the knowledge that no one
had a bigger salary or trailer than anyone else made for a hugely
relaxed, enjoyable shoot: "It's an easygoing, non-hierarchical
attitude, and it's irresistible." Liberated from such concerns, the
cast simply got on with doing the best work they could.</TE>
<TE>   On British film sets, inflated egos simply become a source of rich
humor. On the ill-fated film adaptation of "The Avengers," producer
Jerry Weintraub was occupying the biggest trailer I have ever seen in
Britain; it seemed to be about the length of a city block. It was a
standing joke among the British cast and crew, who referred to it in
derisive, incredulous terms. And of course, it didn't make "The
Avengers" one bit better.</TE>
<TE>   Some Are Willing</TE>
<TE>   to Take the Pay Cut</TE>
<TE>   It may seem odd to cite poverty as a unique selling point for
working on films in Britain. Yet many American actors, accustomed to
big salaries in Hollywood but curious enough to seek challenging,
off-kilter work elsewhere, find that modest pay does not offset the
pleasure of satisfying work. Brad Pitt and Heather Graham are just
two who recently took a salary cut to work in Britain for directors
they admire: Guy Ritchie and Chen Kaige, in "Snatch" and "Killing Me
Softly," respectively.</TE>
<TE>   And a steady stream of actors flock to roles on the London
stage--for even less money. The reason? The quality of the work
involved. One could argue Nicole Kidman's career went into overdrive
after her triumph at London's Donmar Warehouse in the controversial
production of "The Blue Room," David Hare's adaptation of "La Ronde."
Kevin Spacey's lucrative Hollywood outings in "K-Pax," "The Shipping
News" and "Pay It Forward" are overshadowed by his tour de force as
Hickey in Eugene O'Neill's "The Iceman Cometh" at London's historic
Old Vic. Spacey enjoyed the experience so much he joined the
theater's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Lange trod the London boards in O'Neill's "Long Day's
Journey Into Night" to critical acclaim; she noted at the time it was
a far more complex, challenging role than anything offered by
American films. Now Gwyneth Paltrow is set to appear at the Donmar
this summer in the American play "Proof."</TE>
<TE>   It's no accident so many American film actors gravitate to the
London stage. The culture of British acting, even film acting, is
more closely bound to stage traditions than in the U.S. British
actors, even eminent ones, relish being part of a company; they are
far more "non-hierarchical," to quote Grant, than their U.S.
counterparts. This collegiate British mentality, a backstage attitude
that everyone in a company has a crucial role, means lead actors
routinely adjourn to the pub with bit-part players after
performances.</TE>
<TE>   It is also common for British actors to move seamlessly among
various media: films, TV, radio plays, commercials, voice-overs,
audio books. They may do two or three such gigs in a day, applying
the same professional standards to each. They do it not because they
expect to make huge amounts of money but because they enjoy the work.
The play's the thing.</TE>
<TE>   This relaxed, amiable, stage-trained attitude is evident on film
sets in Britain, and many American actors seem to like it. The
camaraderie and egalitarianism on British sets invigorates them; it
helps some of them remember why they entered the profession in the
first place.</TE>
<TE>   In sharp contrast, stars often hole up in their trailers on
Hollywood film sets, giving orders to phalanxes of assistants and
taking constant calls from their agents. Each actor seems like a
suspicious, isolated profit center. As a general rule, when films get
made in Britain, actors read the script, agree to it and, during
shooting, simply do their best to serve it. (This is also true, of
course, of some American independent films.)</TE>
<TE>   It almost never happens in Britain, as it does in Hollywood, that
extra writers are drafted in to make a star's character more
appealing, thus potentially compromising the integrity and logic of a
script. Such kid-gloves treatment might be initially flattering to
star actors, but clearly being regarded as an actor first and a star
second may bring even more profound, long-lasting rewards.
Paradoxically, the latter course holds out the promise of more
creative freedom.</TE>
<TE>   I don't mean to be dismissive of Hollywood; its industrial process
of filmmaking has a precision and efficiency that can make an
outsider's jaw sag with awe. And the exasperating, perennially
underfunded nature of the British industry leaves you not knowing
whether to laugh or cry.</TE>
<TE>   An example: Last May I went on location on the "Iris" set on a
cold, blustery day. Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent were playing a scene
inside an isolated seaside cottage; because it was a night scene, a
huge expanse of black canvas was thrown over the cottage. The wind
kept lifting it up, so everyone on set with no specific task
(including actors and a producer) stood in line around the cottage,
holding down the billowing canvas until the scene was done.</TE>
<TE>   Viewed one way, of course, this was farcical. Yet there was also
something rather noble about all those people putting their egos
aside, humbly joining in a communal task to get a job done. I'd bet
that Broadbent, a typically collegial English actor, would have
joined in had he not been speaking lines; in contrast, one could not
imagine the heavy hitters on a film such as "Pearl Harbor"
volunteering for such demeaning labor. (The budget on "Iris," by the
way, was all of $5 million, the cost of the "Pearl Harbor" premiere.)
Altman, I think, would have been tickled by the motley team of canvas
holders on the "Iris" set; they exhibited the sort of spirit he seems
to like in British filmmaking. And the Brits in turn like him; his
sly, sardonic take on life and work and his willingness to speak his
mind seems to chime with their own attitudes. Altman may be a
cantankerous old cuss, but if he's as good as his word, he's welcome
to work here anytime he wants.</TE>

<HD>Quetzal: a Rollicking, Collective Good Time</HD>
<DH>The band, grounded in the politics of its founder, Quetzal
Flores, stakes a claim as L.A.'s leading current Chicano band.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a club packed to the rafters Thursday night, Quetzal celebrated
the release of its new album with a joyful and passionate performance
that cemented its place as the premiere L.A. Chicano band of its
generation.</LD>
<LD>   Don't think Santana or Los Lobos. This polished, nine-piece outfit
plays what you might call jarocho hip, an original blend of Mexican
folklorico, Caribbean rhythms and American rock, all grounded in the
Zapatista politics of its intense founder, guitarist Quetzal Flores.</LD>
<LD>   Revolution hasn't been this much fun since the '60s.</LD>
<TE>   Quetzal is a cool and classy band. On stage Thursday at Cafe Club
Fais Do Do, they demonstrated the qualities that make them so
appealing: Rich songwriting, enchanting arrangements and serious
musicianship.</TE>
<TE>   It's all strings and percussion, with Flores on jarana, a small
Mexican guitar, the smooth Ray Sandoval on electric guitar and the
skillful Kiko Cornejo Jr. on a drums-timbal combination in the style
of modern Cuban timba bands. Dante Pascuzzo played the unusual
six-string bass, picking it like a classical guitar during a
show-stopping solo.</TE>
<TE>   As a group, they exude a lovely and irresistible spirit, much more
so live than on record. The attractive brother-and-sister vocal team
of Gabriel and Martha Gonzalez make a charming centerpiece. Their
sweet harmonies create a magically floating feel, especially when
interlaced with the backup vocals of Rocio Marron, who also delivered
exciting violin solos to the delight of the mostly young, multiethnic
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Quetzal is living proof that drawing on cultural roots can be a
powerful source of creativity, if rock 'n' roll didn't prove that
already. They play with conviction, a quality missing from many
mainstream Latino acts.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, the band converts its cultural pride into an
embracing, unifying force. Its collectivist spirit engulfed the club
during an encore Thursday that repeated a one-word chorus: todos
(everybody).</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody say it," Gabriel Gonzalez exhorted. "It's not a bad
word."</TE>

<HD>Hate, Compassion Converge in a Wyoming Town</HD>
<DH>HBO's gripping adaptation of 'Laramie Project' looks at the
murder of Matthew Shepard and the community in which it happened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Viewers benefited when HBO moved up "The Laramie Project" one
Saturday so that it wouldn't face a movie on essentially the same
topic that NBC had belatedly slotted for March 16 in an apparent
attempt to undermine the cable channel's much superior drama.</LD>
<LD>   Now, happily, no one has to choose between them.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of having its audience diluted by "The Matthew Shepard
Story"--an NBC account not without distinction, by the way--HBO has
the topic to itself tonight, delivering 95 minutes of heartache worth
building an evening around.</LD>
<TE>   Adapting "The Laramie Project" from his off-Broadway play, Moises
Kaufman follows the beams of hate and humanity that converged
following the 1998 murder of a 21-year-old college student by a pair
of local punks who couldn't stand that he was gay.</TE>
<TE>   "He came into the world premature," Matthew Shepard's parents say
in an early statement about their diminutive son, "and left
premature."</TE>
<TE>   The separate trials of his young killers are excerpted here, as is
the courtroom statement that Shepard's father (Terry Kinney) made to
one of them, saying he would "like nothing better than to see you
die," yet advocating "mercy for someone who refused to show any
mercy." It's a lump-in-the-throat moment without false sentiment from
director Kaufman.  Although Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson are
in prison for the murder, how much of the town is culpable? "Does
Laramie grow children like that here?" a resident wonders. Don't
expect facile answers.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, you get overlapping realities here, for this is a movie
about the researching of a play about what Shepard's murder says
about Laramie. In other words, the "project" is the play, and vice
versa. Unfolding quasi-documentary style, it is intensely moving in
its simplicity, the economy of its ensemble cast's performances
belying the brutal nature of the crime Kaufman (Nestor Carbonell) and
members of his New York theater company hear about as they gather
material in Laramie. This contrast in tones somehow makes what
happened all the more shocking.</TE>
<TE>   Among those interviewed by the troupe are the police officer (Amy
Madigan), who exposed herself to the AIDS virus at the crime scene;
the University of Wyoming's first "out" lesbian professor (Janeane
Garofalo); another professor (Camryn Manheim), who feels the play
will be therapeutic for the community; and a shopkeeper (Margo
Martindale) and her sister (Christina Ricci), who knew Shepard well.</TE>
<TE>   Through this interviewing device, Kaufman relates with acute
clarity the magnitude of bigotry and compassion that co-exist
uneasily in this Wyoming city whose residents maintain repeatedly
here that they "live and let live."</TE>
<TE>   If so, this story asks, how was it that Shepard was savagely
beaten because of his sexual orientation, bound to a rural fence like
a rag doll and left to die, his highly publicized murder making him a
poster victim in the battle against homophobia?</TE>
<TE>   Is Laramie necessarily a metaphor for wider prejudice? That's hard
to calculate, especially with other crimes that have occurred since,
including the recent murder of a gay man in Santa Barbara who was set
on fire in his sleep. Yet the rudimentary fence is shown repeatedly,
becoming a symbol of the divide separating Laramie's more enlightened
residents and those who condemn Shepard's "lifestyle" as aggressively
as they do his murder. "The media is portraying him as a saint,"
protests one woman (Laura Linney), who believes Shepard provoked his
killers and that he "flaunted" being gay.</TE>
<TE>   Although unseen, Shepard looms indelibly here in the memories of
those who knew and liked him. "Laramie sparkles, doesn't it?" limo
driver Doc O'Connor (Steve Buscemi) recalls him saying one evening
about the city's lights, a blue glow bouncing off the clouds and
visible even from the lonely spot where he was fatally beaten and
lashed to the fence. Those lights, O'Connor adds, may have been "the
last thing he saw on this earth."</TE>
<TE>   "The Laramie Project" premieres tonight at 8 on HBO. The network
has rated it TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children under 14).</TE>

<LD>   Universal Chief Decries Nasty Oscar Campaign</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of new criticism of best picture nominee "A Beautiful
Mind," Universal Pictures Chairman Stacey Snider lashed out at what
she considers below-the-belt Oscar maneuvering.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter at Las Vegas' ShoWest
Convention, Snider alluded to charges that the filmmakers had twisted
history in their portrayal of schizophrenic, Nobel Prize-winning
mathematician John Nash, sidestepping his homosexuality and purported
anti-Semitism as well as elements of his personal life.</TE>
<TE>   The innuendo, she said, was painful to the filmmakers--and Nash.
"A 73-year-old man who has gone through hell and who agreed to
entrust us with his life shouldn't have to go through these attacks,"
Snider said. "To take statements out of context, which were said at a
time when he was a self-admitted schizophrenic, seems shameful.... We
never set out to sugarcoat his life."</TE>
<TE>   Without naming names, Snider suggested that the criticism was
attributable to mudslinging competitors in the Oscar race.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a shocking absence of self-restraint," she said of
the campaign. "Lines that should be clear to us have recklessly been
crossed. Filmmakers who have done honest work that was never
engineered to win an award are having to defend their intentions."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Actors Try to Lure Talent to Trenton, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   William Baldwin, Paul Sorvino and Valerie Harper met with New
Jersey lawmakers in support of a $20-million plan to build movie
studios in the city's abandoned factories.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin, president of an activist group called the Creative
Coalition, said the $20 million would generate $100 million in
taxable revenue, while Harper said it would create hundreds of jobs
for construction workers, hairdressers, tailors and dry cleaners.
Sorvino, who, like Harper, has roots in the state, said he has three
movies ready to go if the legislation is passed.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some say the move is ill-timed. Citing a $3-billion budget
deficit, Gov. James E. McGreevey has laid off state workers, frozen
aid to schools and municipalities and cut aid to higher education.
"We're all in favor of luring independent filmmakers to the Trenton
area, but we believe other communities have managed to attract such
business without employing so much in taxpayer funds," Assembly
members Linda Greenstein and Gary Guear said in a letter to
Republican state Sen. Peter Inverso, who sponsored the measure.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   Broadway on the Rebound at Box Office</TE>
<TE>   For all the gloom-and-doom talk in the wake of Sept. 11, Broadway
seems to have rebounded. Last week's weekly gross, in fact, was $12.2
million--a 16% increase over the same period last year, according to
the New York Times. Another hopeful sign: All but one of the 39
Tony-eligible theaters are booked.</TE>
<TE>   The season's total box office is still down by 5% from the
previous year, but the figure was 10% in mid-fall. Theater executives
credit a rise in theatergoing by locals, spurred by two promotional
campaigns, for helping to make up for the lack of tourists.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Artists May Be Asked</TE>
<TE>   to Repay Federal Grants</TE>
<TE>   Payback time? If two Republican congressmen have their way,
artists who achieve commercial success will have to reimburse grants
made to them earlier in their careers.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. George Nethercutt of Washington raised the issue this week,
citing the practice in which professional athletes return scholarship
money to college. Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia also took up the
cause, suggesting that successful actors who had received money from
the National Endowment for the Arts return it.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen B. Mason, acting director of the NEA, told a subcommittee
of the House Appropriations Committee that she'd take it under
consideration. Paybacks would be difficult to implement under present
rules, which say the NEA can only accept contributions from
individuals and organizations not eligible to apply for grants.
Besides, since 1996, Congress has banned NEA grants to individuals,
except for writers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   E! to Begin Showing Reruns of 'SNL'</TE>
<TE>   Reruns of "Saturday Night Live," which already can be seen on
cable's Comedy Central, will soon begin popping up on E!
Entertainment Television, as the network best known for its slavish
coverage of Hollywood has licensed the "SNL" library through 2008.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, E! will begin airing repeats of the current "SNL"
season in September, while reruns of the early years will begin in
April. Comedy Central still has rights to rerun 20 years of "SNL"
through 2003.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Susan Stamberg, who hosted "All Things Considered" from 1972 to
1986, will return temporarily to NPR's afternoon newsmagazine,
co-hosting next week with Robert Siegel.... A memorial in Van Nuys to
slain Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, which was to have
included a performance today by the Los Angeles Chamber Group, has
been postponed. A new date has not yet been set.... John Glover and
Judith Light will head the cast in the West Coast premiere of Athol
Fugard's "Sorrows and Rejoicings," which opens at the Mark Taper
Forum on May 23. The playwright will direct the piece, which deals
with a poet exiled for his political beliefs.... More turnover at
embattled KPFK-FM (90.7): Betto Arcos will end his stint as music
director but will continue as one of the anchors on his radio show
"Global Village." And, after five years, Marc Cooper--who recently
locked horns with management over his refusal to do on-air
fund-raising--is leaving as afternoon host of "Marc Cooper's Daily
Review." "Radio Nation," which he anchors, will continue to air on
the station.... Will Smith and Martin Lawrence will hook up again for
"Bad Boys 2." Paramount Pictures is planning a remake of John
Frankenheimer's 1962 classic "The Manchurian Candidate," Variety
reports. And, according to the trade paper, Goldie Hawn's production
company is developing a TV movie for cable outlet FX about the
passengers of United Flight 93, the airliner that crashed in
Pennsylvania on Sept. 11.</TE>

<HD>Fox News Channel Finds Itself Outfoxed</HD>
<DH>The cable outlet, apparently unaware that stories posted on
HollywoodPulse.com are intentionally false, is fooled. A Webzine
culprit explains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY RICHMOND</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I popped up on the Fox News Channel the other day. Maybe you missed
it. I was part of a story about Paula Poundstone and the preferential
treatment she may or may not have received recently from a Superior
Court judge in Santa Monica</LD>
<LD>   My qualifications? Funny I should mention that. I'm co-founder of
a year-old Internet Webzine called HollywoodPulse.com, for which a
partner and I ruminate weekly about the goings-on in show business
from a decidedly unique (read: warped) perspective.</LD>
<LD>   Our secret? We make it up.</LD>
<TE>   We pride ourselves on ingredients that are nearly 100% fact-free.
Truth is our sworn enemy, logic our perennial adversary. The mandate:
to offend with equality and impunity.</TE>
<TE>   Our "stories" have included such exclusives as the bidding war
among record labels to ensure that Mariah Carey never records a CD
for them; the admission by "Friends" lead Matthew Perry that he had
become hopelessly addicted to rehab clinics; the scoop that Cher's
face had inexplicably fallen off while running an errand; and NBC's
unveiling last December of a "Drunk for the Holidays" campaign in
tandem with the network's newfound acceptance of hard-liquor
advertising.</TE>
<TE>   It is what is commonly known in contemporary society as satire.
Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Yet while the humor presentation
is demonstrably dry, it's the rare human who mistakes it for anything
approaching genuine.</TE>
<TE>   This is where Fox News Channel comes in.</TE>
<TE>   My East Coast-based partner on HollywoodPulse.com, Tom Comi, was
bemused on Feb. 22 to find a message in our site's contact e-mailbox
from a producer at Fox News Channel, who was wondering if one of our
representatives might have time to submit to a taped interview for a
planned Poundstone story.</TE>
<TE>   When Comi shared this curious information with me, I assumed that
the piece Fox had in mind involved parody of some sort.</TE>
<TE>   I was wrong. "This is Ray with HollywoodPulse.com," I said to the
inquiring e-mailer, who should probably remain nameless.</TE>
<TE>   "So, can you come down to our Los Angeles bureau today to tape an
interview about Paula Poundstone's preferential treatment by the
law?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," I replied, "I'm not exactly sure if your premise would be
entirely my take. But I could head down maybe on Monday to discuss
it."</TE>
<TE>   This was a Friday. On Monday, I drove to the strip-mall offices of
Fox News Channel in West L.A., convinced that someone would greet me
at the door to say, "We're sorry, but there's been a terrible
mistake. You are so far from legit that we're prepared to offer you
hush money if you promise to deny this conversation ever took place.
In lieu of that, please get back into your car and drive back into
the hole from whence you crawled."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, I heard, "Hey! Come on in!"</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the research staff at Fox News hadn't bothered to
actually read the material on our Web site. Not a single sentence. If
they had, they would have seen mock stories headlined, "Poundstone:
'I'm a Drunk Driver, Not a Child Molester!'" and "Poundstone Granted
'Supervised' Child Abuse." Hardly the kind of credible journalism one
might associate with expert opinion.</TE>
<TE>   How did this slip through the Fox News Channel cracks? No doubt,
it went something like this:</TE>
<TE>   A researcher probably entered the words "Poundstone" and "court"
into the Yahoo! search engine. Positioned at No. 17 on the resultant
list is a HollywoodPulse.com story from Nov. 17, 2001, headlined,
"Paula Poundstone Plays Dumb After Violation." The utterly fabricated
piece found the comedian expressing purported shock and outrage that
a recent liquor-drinking, pot-smoking, coke-snorting binge
represented a true violation of her probation.</TE>
<TE>   But again, this was apparently ignored by Fox News, as was the
lead story spoof on our site that very week detailing how a judge had
granted Poundstone new child abuse privileges so long as it was
overseen by a court-appointed monitor.</TE>
<TE>   This is admittedly biting, taste-challenged stuff. And that is, of
course, all the more reason we should never have been allowed to fly
in under the top-rated cable news channel's radar. Someone probably
scanned a headline, scribbled down the Web address--which sounds
legitimate enough on its face--and it was off to the races.</TE>
<TE>   How else to explain that Fox News had a full workweek to blow the
whistle after I taped my interview with reporter Trace Gallagher on
Feb. 25? The story didn't run on the network's 4 p.m. edition of "The
Fox Report" until March 1. And when it aired, there I was, my
frightfully jowly mug weighing in on the subject, with my name and
HollywoodPulse.com affiliation gloriously emblazoned on screen.</TE>
<TE>   It would be one thing if I had set out to dupe Fox News and
somehow succeeded. The truth is scarier. The network duped itself,
through either sheer laziness or cluelessness.</TE>
<TE>   Was it my place to apprise them of the fact that they were about
to assign credibility to a spurious source? I thought not. Not when
it meant being able to flaunt it in the very first completely
truthful story ever to appear on the demented pages of
HollywoodPulse.com. Not when it enabled us to flag its appearance
with the on-site banner "As Seen on Fox News Channel."</TE>
<TE>   I mean, these are the guys who proclaim, "We report. You decide."
I simply decided to let them report. The result wasn't real
journalism, merely an incredible simulation.</TE>

<HD>Vital Information Has Much to Communicate</HD>
<DH>High-energy ensemble of all-stars gets an added boost from
a rare U.S. appearance by guest saxophonist Bill Evans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vital Information's press data describe the band as an "all-star
soul/jazz/rock super group." OK. But even granting the fact that its
members--drummer-leader Steve Smith, keyboardist Tom Coster,
guitarist Frank Gambale and bassist Baron Browne--have a collective
resume that includes gigs with the likes of Journey, Chick Corea,
Santana and Billy Cobham, that's a lot of hyperbole for anyone to
have to live up to.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately on Thursday, in the opening set of a four-night run at
Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, Vital Information clarified matters,
explaining, via their music, that they really are a first-rate
contemporary jazz ensemble. Galvanized by the explosive but never
intrusive drumming of Smith and the multi-textured sounds of Coster's
keyboards, the band--their program enhanced by the presence of
saxophonist Bill Evans--played with an energy and imagination that
made over-hyped press statements superfluous.</LD>
<LD>   Smith's relaxed manner and easygoing interaction with the
full-house crowd was an additional asset, as was his programming of
the set. Balancing his selections well, he juxtaposed energetic,
often funk-driven originals against a brief, well-crafted solo drum
feature and an atmospheric number, "Europe," featuring Coster on
accordion.</LD>
<TE>   Evans' presence was  also a plus. A veteran of Miles Davis'
electric band of the early '80s, his fluent, virtuosic artistry on
tenor and soprano saxophones has been heard mostly in Europe in
recent years. Stretching out on his own piece, "Van's Joint," and the
final "The Perfect Date," his soloing was driven by a richly
emotional subtext, interspersing passionate blues shouts and
fast-fingered runs with warm-toned, middle-register melodies.</TE>
<TE>   At its best,  his playing underscored the fact that Evans deserves
a much  wider hearing beyond his usual European circuit. His
superlative alliance with Vital Information sounded like the perfect
vehicle to make that happen.</TE>
<TE>   Vital Information with special guest Bill Evans at Catalina Bar &amp;
Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd. Tonight at 8:30 and 10:30; Sunday at
7:30 and 9:30 p.m., $18 cover. Two-drink minimum. (323) 466-2210.</TE>

<LD>As a former Navy medical officer during the Vietnam era while at
Great Lakes Naval Hospital in Illinois, I tended the wounds of many
soldiers brought to us from the battlefield. James E. Caccavo's
commentary on "We Were Soldiers" ("Knee-Deep in the Blood, Sweat and
Soul of Vietnam," March 4) was 100% on the mark. After seeing the
movie Sunday, I could barely sleep, since the vivid scenes brought
back many unpleasant memories.</LD>
<LD>   MICHAEL L. FRIEDMAN</LD>
<LD>   Torrance</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I must respectfully disagree with Caccavo's contention that the
movie "takes no political stands." With romantic music accompanying
every battle (except when the Vietnamese come rushing from their
caves, when we hear primitive jungle drums), constant scenes of
soldiers at prayer, the portrayal of protagonist Hal Moore as nothing
short of perfect, and the film's presentation of war as an inevitable
event requiring only obedience and bravery from its participants, "We
Were Soldiers" dismisses by omission any moral or political questions
about Vietnam or any other war. This in itself is certainly a
political stand. The film tells us war is brutal, soldiers brave and
all we can do is pray and salute the flag. Questioning our leaders is
not an option.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is too bad your movie review on "We Were Soldiers" was written
by an individual who just doesn't get it ("Battle Saga at War With
Itself," March 1). In his closing lines, Kenneth Turan demonstrates
his terrible lack of understanding: "We cannot forget what this film
prefers to avoid knowing, that bravery and self-sacrifice without a
reason are not cause for celebration but rather one of the saddest,
one of the most regrettable of human activities." Nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   Americans--indeed, the vast majority of people
everywhere--understand that performing their duties as best they can,
day in and day out, is critical to our nation and human society. When
those duties involve great risk and sacrifice, yet are still
accomplished, we celebrate the individuals as heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Turan thinks a soldier's duty is only reasonable if Turan approves
of the national political context.</TE>

<TE>   The fundamental disservice a movie such as this does to our
children is to push the fantasy that war is a proper endeavor for
young men, and an inevitable instrument of foreign power. In that
way, it psychologically prepares boys and young men for the next war
that the old men decide they must fight.</TE>

<TE>   Genuine Artistic Talent</TE>
<TE>   Calling "An American in Paris" "another songfest along the Seine"
and comparing it to the hodgepodge called "Moulin Rouge" with people
who can't sing or dance is at best absurd! ("Musical Upset at the
Oscars?" by Tom O'Neil, March 6)</TE>
<TE>   "An American in Paris" had the artistry of Gene Kelly, Leslie
Caron and Oscar Levant, to name a few. In other words--no, in exact
words--real, genuine, authentic, original, spectacular and lasting
talent. That is something you can never match or compare to anyone
else--and why would you want to?</TE>

<TE>   Smoking in Movies</TE>
<TE>   In his insightful analysis of Hollywood's addiction to tobacco
("Ad Banned, but Smoking on Screen Isn't," March 5), Patrick
Goldstein wrote that a top Warner Bros. corporate publicist called
the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine to
ask if the university knew that its funds were being used to support
Prof. Stanton Glantz's campaign against smoking in movies. Goldstein
neglected to point out that Glantz's campaign is supported by outside
funding sources, not by the university.</TE>
<TE>   It's laughable that a mega-company like Warner Bros. complains to
a university about being picked on by a single professor. It ought to
rechannel its energy to figure out how to produce films without
enticing our youth into a deadly addiction.</TE>

<TE>   I have no objection to Sissy Spacek smoking in "In the Bedroom."
What I do object to are the two clear depictions of the Marlboro pack

It adds nothing to the film that would not have been served by a
generic pack.</TE>

<TE>   Three Chords and Truth</TE>
<TE>   "Three chords and the truth" were the stuff that Harlan Howard was
made of ("Harlan Howard, 74; Prolific Songwriter," March 5). He was
like a big heart that steadily pumped fresh blood into the veins of
country music. Now his heart has stopped beating, and all of country
music has skipped a beat.</TE>
<TE>   Though we mourn, we must be transformed by his simple formula. In
a world that has gone from New Wave to New Age to New Rage in a
matter of decades, we must return to his three-chords-and-the-truth
philosophy. "Two turntables and a microphone" makes a clever ditty,
but it is simply not enough to capture the hearts and souls of the
post-9/11 generation.</TE>

<TE>   Kelly and the Censors</TE>
<TE>   In his review of "Gene Kelly: Anatomy of a Dancer" ("'Gene Kelly'
Retraces Steps of an Illustrious Career," March 5), Lewis Segal
states that George Balanchine's original choreography for "Slaughter
on Tenth Avenue" was never considered censorable. However, it should
be clarified that when Kelly's turn came to shoot the sequence in
1948 for "Words and Music," MGM censors would not allow the ballet's
original scenario, with pimps and dance hall girls, into a musical
revue for the whole family. Kelly relayed this very fact to his
biographer Clive Hirschhorn, who is interviewed in the film.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Segal seems to have misunderstood a sequence
analyzing the differences between Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly. At no
time does the film either attempt to "exalt Kelly at the expense of
Astaire," or state that Kelly was the first to dance in the rain, on
skates, etc. In fact, the documentary celebrates their differences
and makes the point that comparing the two men is futile; they were
too dissimilar both physically and stylistically.</TE>

<TE>   Here's Johnny</TE>
<TE>   Why is everyone waiting for a sound bite, a snippet, a kernel of
wisdom from Johnny Carson? ("Much Has Changed Since Carson Was King,"
by Brian Lowry, March 6). He isn't Edward R. Murrow or Walter
Cronkite. He's a comic. He had his run, but he ended up a bitter,
grumpy man. He could have endorsed Jay Leno and passed him the torch,
but he chose to sulk in Malibu. If Johnny wants to weigh in on the
Koppel-Letterman imbroglio or the state of TV, fine. If not, that's
fine too. We'll somehow make it one way or the other.</TE>
<TE>   DAVID PEREZ</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson" was and still is a breath of
fresh air in television's "vast wasteland." If you doubt this, just
pick up a copy of some of the old shows at your local video store.
Television has changed in many ways since Carson left the air. But is
it really better? To many of us, Johnny will always be king.</TE>

<HD>Sanpaolesi's Photos Reflect a Sense of Place</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his second, moving show at Craig Krull gallery, Italian
photographer Tito Sanpaolesi presents a dozen framed moments dense
with character, narrative possibility, and the familiar, poignant
texture of time passing.</LD>
<LD>   From above, Sanpaolesi shoots (in black and white) down onto a
stained, raw wooden table, one that reeks of rustic living, honest
and tough. Completing the scene are a man's hands resting on the
table's edge and a small, half-emptied glass between them. The
sweater is coarse, the hands experienced, rough and dirty around the
nails. Only a tiny wedge of this man's reality is revealed here, but
it's a ripe and rich one, just begging to tell its stories.</LD>
<LD>   In another image, Sanpaolesi shoots toward an open window, its
sheer curtains billowing out into the night air. The curtains part
slightly, leaving a crescent-shaped gap, through which we see the
moon--or perhaps just a bright streetlight, a shimmering white orb
floating in the darkness, perfectly framed. A dreamy, grainy image of
fantasy and escape, it's as though Sanpaolesi managed to photograph a
fairy tale.</LD>
<TE>   Based in his native Florence, Sanpaolesi photographs
internationally. The images here, shot in New York, Argentina, Italy
and Namibia, each evoke a strong sense of place, though not
necessarily a specific geographic locale. Sanpaolesi's sensibility is
that of the poetic humanist, relishing the details in space and
structure that tell of lives lived within them. When he shoots a
street bisected by a shiny scar of tar, an eye embraced by a delicate
web of wrinkles, a foot as caked and dusty as the dirt it pushes off
from, his glimpse of the particular resonates with the universal.</TE>

<HD>An Ancient Garden of Wonders</HD>
<DH>In their blend of science and art, painted images of plant
life from Renaissance-era Florence impart a strange sense of the
modern.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHARD</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Think Florence in the Renaissance and the images that come to
mind--of Leonardo's saints and Botticelli's goddesses--are obvious
inventions, too good to be true.</LD>
<LD>   But artists of another sort, fabulously skillful ones, were also
busy in the city. The earthbound masters in "The Flowering of
Florence: Botanical Art for the Medici," which went on view this week
and remains till May 27 at the National Gallery of Art, did not paint
nymphs and angels. They studied leaves and flowers. They portrayed
fruit and veggies.</LD>
<LD>   Jacopo Ligozzi (1547-1626), Giovanna Garzoni (1600-1670) and odd
Bartolomeo Bimbi (1648-1729), whose cauliflowers frighten, deserve
this recognition. They're less famous than they should be. Their
scrupulous attention, their click into sharp focus, and that ability
to blend art, spirituality and science makes them wholly of their
time, yet they're also far ahead of it. Because the three of them
together helped devise in Italy a variety of picture still very much
in vogue; a strange sense of modernity rises from their art.</LD>
<TE>   Their pictures for the Medici seldom summon up the cowled monks
and intrigues, the poisonings and popes, of Renaissance romances.
Instead they make you think of wildflower guides, and vase-of-flowers
still-lifes from 17th century Amsterdam and 19th century Baltimore,
and rural country fairs.</TE>
<TE>   Suppose you grew a squash that weighed 160 pounds. You'd call the
local paper to have that marvel photographed. When Cosimo III, the
Medici grand duke, accomplished such a feat in 1711, he summoned
Signor Bimbi to have his vegetable depicted.</TE>
<TE>   Bimbi was a specialist in such kitchen-garden wonders--an 18-pound
cauliflower, an 8-pound horseradish from hell. Among his most amazing
oils is one that heaps before you 115 different varieties of pear.</TE>
<TE>   The Medici loved gardens--flower gardens, herb gardens, bosky
woods, parterres--and like breeders of top thoroughbreds, they had
their favorites portrayed. Cosimo I (1519-1574), the first grand duke
of Tuscany, had his private study in the Palazzo Vecchio filled with
painted images of animals and plants. His descendant Giovan Carlo
built himself a sitting room called "The Paradise of Flowers." Such
displays declared the grandeur of the Medici. So did their scented
gardens, the rarities they grew there (irises from Persia, sunflowers
from Peru), and the painted books they ordered to document their
plants.</TE>
<TE>   The paintings done on paper by Ligozzi were apparently produced
for just such ducal volumes. They're exceptionally precise and,
although not idealized, exceptionally beautiful. His paintings have
no background, their flowers float on whiteness, but they're so
tactile in their details they seem to jump into the room.</TE>
<TE>   Ligozzi, in these pictures, developed a technique that combined
the skills of a medieval miniaturist with those of an oil painter,
although he was neither. He'd start by outlining his subject, in
pencil. He'd then fill in the outline with a ground of flat white
gouache. "To this prepared surface," Lucia Tongiorgi Tomasi tells us
in the catalog, "he added a succession of translucent layers of
colors using an ever finer series of brushes. In this way he managed
... to capture the most minute details of his subjects, such as the
fuzzy surface of a leaf, the fine filaments in a mass of roots, or
the transparent colors of a flower petal. The artist finished each of
his works with a layer of varnish." I know no other painter who
employed such a technique. Ligozzi used watercolors as if they were
oils.</TE>
<TE>   One feels science in his pictures. There's a cool scrutiny in the
way the peering artist refuses to exclude the withering of a petal or
the yellowing of a leaf.</TE>
<TE>   The first flowers one encounters in the gallery's exhibit, those
from the 1400s, are not like this at all.</TE>
<TE>   The disc-like roses, red and white, that one sees in the
background of Domenico Veneziano's "Madonna and Child," circa 1445,
aren't specimens, they're emblems. The Christian God who made the
world filled it with his symbols. The red rose stands for martyrdom,
the white rose for virginity. In Veneziano's panel they grow from the
same bush.</TE>
<TE>   The flowers in the foreground of a later crucifixion by Pietro
Perugino, circa 1483, though scrutinized more closely, remain as
emblematic. The acacia by the cross represents Christ's passion, the
red poppy his blood, the bulrush our salvation. The lessons thus
delivered aren't botanical but biblical.</TE>
<TE>   Even Leonardo, that fastidious observer, retains a background
sense of all-pervading holiness in everything he draws. He cannot
help but idealize. The curving lines that outline his pear blossoms
and grasses in a 1483 drawing seem to yearn for circularity as if
they were responding to the music of the spheres.</TE>
<TE>   Giovanna Garzoni, who made paintings for the Medici from 1642 to
1651, cared less for metaphysics. Her arrangement on a single sheet
of a lizard and a hyacinth, four cherries and an artichoke is less
concerned with science, or echoes of the sacred, than it is with
decoration.</TE>
<TE>   The decorative impulse gradually becomes more and more important.
One sees it in the Florentine pietre dure objects shown, those
elegant mosaics of semiprecious stone. One feels it in the fabrics
too. Those daffodils and roses in gold and silver thread are not
there to teach botany or dogma, but just to please the eye.</TE>
<TE>   Daffodils already are out here in Rock Creek Park. Spring is in
the air. The show's timing is just right.</TE>

<HD>'Any Day Now' Can Hold Its Head High</HD>
<DH>After four seasons, the always-striving series about an
interracial friendship comes to an end in a two-hour special.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of television's most likable, distinctive and ambitious drama
series ends its four-season run on Lifetime on Sunday with an
obligatory knotting-loose-ends finale that mingles schmaltz with a
sense of humor.</LD>
<LD>   Life gets rather ugly at times, but at least happy endings are
still possible on TV.</LD>
<LD>   This double-sized farewell is hardly the best of "Any Day Now,"
whose best soared. It made intelligence its signature while
confronting with heart and passion a multitude of hot-button racial
issues--from the N-word to black discrimination based on skin
tone--that other entertainment series wouldn't have thought of
touching.</LD>
<TE>   "Any Day Now" had many compelling stories to tell. While
frequently disagreeing, its Birmingham, Ala., protagonists--African
American Rene Jackson (Lorraine Toussaint) and white Mary Elizabeth
(M.E.) O'Brien (Annie Potts)--had a 30-year-friendship made in
racial-harmony heaven. Their own personal histories in the South
intersected the nation's past and present, their bumps in the road
becoming a metaphor for the tumorous relations between many blacks
and whites that continue as America makes its way into the 21st
century.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, some bumps get smoothed out.</TE>
<TE>   It's not only the dawn of an exciting new career for M.E., who
seems destined finally for the intellectual challenges she deserves
yet doesn't get at home from her amiable but unremarkable lug of a
husband, Collair (Chris Mulkey). In addition, she has one last
crucial pearl of motherly wisdom to impart to her daughter, Kelly
(Olivia Friedman).</TE>
<TE>   And it's not only a wedding day for Rene, an attorney who is set
to marry Judge "Turk" Terhune (William Allen Young), if she can just
find the time--and the cake.</TE>
<TE>   There's also one last soapbox to mount, in a controversy arising
from the discovery of an old slave cemetery, over which one of Rene's
clients wants to build a shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   Should the U.S. pay African Americans reparations for slavery?
Yes, demands Rene, who crusades for this forcefully before ultimately
deciding that an apology for slavery would do nicely.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to stop the cycle of fear and shame," she lectures a
group of legislators, "is for all of us to stop pointing fingers at
the other side and simply acknowledge the horrific genocide of life
and rape of the human souls that has occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Preachy, but on the money.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, reconciliation becomes the finale's theme, whether it's
Kelly and her husband on the mend, or Rene's and M.E.'s aging mothers
finally reaching across the racial divide to end their acrimony.</TE>
<TE>   This is one of those weekly hours that you tend to take for
granted until it's gone. As "Any Day Now" fades out, here's saluting
a series, created by Nancy Miller and Deborah Joy LeVine, that has
always ridden the crest of high aspirations, and two fine actresses,
in Potts and Toussaint, who deserved a pedestal of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Even if those noodles who vote on the Emmys never got the message.</TE>
<TE>   "Any Day Now" will be shown Sunday night at 9 on Lifetime. The
network has rated it TV-PG-L (may be unsuitable for young children,
with an advisory for coarse language).</TE>

<HD>'Pyromania' Kicks Off Album Series</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was nearly 20 years ago that Def Leppard's "Pyromania" helped put
pop-metal on the musical map, spawning a flood of Aquanet-armed
imitators whose output would rattle the airwaves through the 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   While some music fans would point this out as reason enough to
keep that era in the rearview mirror, VH1 has chosen the
multi-platinum effort to kick off its latest series, "Ultimate
Albums" (Sunday, 9 p.m.)</LD>
<LD>   In coming weeks, the program will feature hourlong examinations of
key works by such varied acts as Led Zeppelin, Bob Marley, No Doubt
and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Although the music channel is
promoting the series as new, it seems more a revival of the "Classic
Albums" showcase it launched in 1997. No matter, the format is still
entertaining, often as much for the revisionist posturing as insider
information.</LD>
<TE>   "Pyromania" is cast as a "Sgt. Pepper's" for the headbanger set,
an album that proved metal could dig deep without being demonic. lts
lasting influence is attested to by such current luminaries as System
of a Down and Lit.</TE>
<TE>   But while producer Mutt Lange contributed as writer or co-writer
on all the tracks and worked as architect of the band's breakthrough
re-direction, he is missing in action on the program.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the anecdotes involve Lange, who is also the husband and
Svengali behind country star Shania Twain.</TE>
<TE>   The making-of stories on such hits as "Photograph," "Rock of Ages"
and "Foolin'" are all here, and band members, particularly singer Joe
Elliott, fired guitarist Pete Willis and his replacement, Phil
Collen, are refreshingly candid.</TE>
<TE>   Does "Pyromania" deserve such a lavish look? Most critics didn't
think so, but as the program asks, can 10 million record buyers be
wrong?</TE>

<AU>RAFAEL GONZALEZ</AU>
<BD>Rafael Gonzalez is executive director of Public
Allies-Los Angeles, a nonprofit organization that creates
opportunities for diverse young leaders to practice leadership and
strengthen communities.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education will
determine the fate this week of not only the Belmont Learning Complex
but also its surrounding neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   For more than 20 years, the communities of Pico Union, Westlake,
MacArthur Park, Temple Beaudry, Angelino Heights, Echo Park,
Chinatown and downtown have struggled with an overcrowded Belmont
High School and have been waiting for a new high school to be built.
An estimated 5,000 additional high school seats are needed to
accommodate the Belmont High School attendance area.</LD>
<LD>   In a community that is already fractured by school busing and a
recent history of opportunistic squatting for political gain, an
unfinished school resembling a ghost town should not stand any longer
in the way of our youth's education and community development.</LD>
<TE>   Growing up in Pico Union in the 1970s, I attended Hobart
Elementary School and in the sixth grade was reluctantly bused by
order of the school district to Dixie Canyon Elementary in Sherman
Oaks. I attended Berendo Junior High and would have attended Belmont
High School, but the push from school officials for me to attend a
high school in the San Fernando Valley won out.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the neighborhood's high density and subsequent school
overcrowding, my community of friends from Hobart and Berendo were
dispersed all over the city to high schools like Belmont, Los
Angeles, Manual Arts, Jefferson, Chatsworth, North Hollywood, Grant,
Reseda, Birmingham, Verdugo and Van Nuys. Instead of choosing school
busing, I attended the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies, which
at the time was located just west of Pico Union. I walked to school
and graduated in 1985. In the process I lost touch with childhood
friends, who were spending a large part of their daily lives on a
school bus.</TE>
<TE>   The youth of today deserve better; I urge the board to support and
play a part in uniting our community by supporting the construction
of the Belmont Learning Complex.</TE>
<TE>   We now know that the school can be safely completed.</TE>
<TE>   From community surveys and conversations I've had with parents and
youths from the neighborhood, the consensus is strong: Families want
to see the school built.</TE>
<TE>   Let's not wait any longer; our families have waited long enough.
Let's not continue randomly dispersing our youth to schools
throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   Let the neighborhood have the Belmont Learning Complex to serve as
an anchor for community building.</TE>
<TE>   Let the school bell ring at the Belmont Learning Complex.</TE>

<LD>The Bush administration hopes to impose stricter regulations when the
1996 welfare law expires later this year. One recommendation is a
40-hour workweek requirement for welfare recipients, up from the
current 30 hours. Another calls for 70% of welfare recipients to hold
jobs by 2007, up from the current 30%. Additionally, the White House
plans to spend $200 million in federal funds to encourage people to
get married, believing that children raised in two-parent households
fare better.</LD>
<LD>   How these potential changes will affect those receiving benefits
is now being hotly debated. KAREN KARLITZ spoke with a woman who
receives assistance from the Greater Avenues for Independence
program, Riverside County's welfare-to-work program.</LD>
<LD>   JENNIFER SANDBERG</LD>
<TE>   Riverside</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm 19 years old. I was 16 when I had my baby. I'm a single
parent. I went on welfare when I was 17 because my mom had to return
to Holland to take care of her sick father. I'm a U.S. citizen and
Holland denied my citizenship, so I had to live here and I couldn't
get by with my baby without some help.</TE>
<TE>   I work as a food server in a fast-food restaurant. My GAIN worker
told me about the job, encouraged me to apply. I've been with GAIN
for about two months.</TE>
<TE>   When I first applied for welfare with the county, I went back to
school to get my GED. If you're a parent under the age of 20 and you
don't have a high school diploma or GED, you have to go back to
school. After I got my GED, they sent me to GAIN to find a job.</TE>
<TE>   I want to work. The county provides child care for my son. I found
the day-care facility and the county pays for it. He's covered
full-time as long as I'm working or going to school.</TE>
<TE>   I want to go back to school to study computers. The county will
also pay for that.</TE>
<TE>   My son, now 3, was used to having me home most of the time, but he
really likes going to day care. I had a temporary job before this
where I worked from 2 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.; he didn't like that. Now I
work three days a week, so he still gets to spend a lot of time with
me. I'm off on Saturday and Sunday because child care is closed those
days. I feel proud when I get a paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   If they change the amount of work hours [or a combined total of
work and school hours] to 40, I wouldn't get any quality time with my
son.</TE>
<TE>   I'd have no time for my household. To be a single parent and have
to do everything by myself, I wouldn't like working that many hours.
And my son wouldn't understand why Mommy had to be away all the time.
He enjoys our time together. I try to take him somewhere every day I
have off. Forty hours, no, that's too much.</TE>
<TE>   Now that I'm working I don't get food stamps, but a few months ago
I got [low-cost] housing. My rent is cheaper so they reduced my other
benefits. But I'll be fine financially and my new apartment is
wonderful. Before I had it, my whole county check, every dollar of
it, went to pay my rent. Now I have money for my bills.</TE>
<TE>   I think it's stupid to pass laws to encourage people to get
married. People get married because they love one another, not
because they're supposed to. That would create more problems.</TE>
<TE>   I think the way the county program is now is fine. Before, people
kept on having babies to get bigger checks. Now, you have one baby
and get on with the county, and that's as much money as you're going
to get.</TE>
<TE>   I've been through pretty much all of the [county] programs since I
was a teen parent. I think GAIN offers a lot of opportunities, but
it's up to you to take advantage of them. They pay for your child
care--you just have to be willing to go and get that job. If you
don't, then you're not going to get anything.</TE>

<LD>Reading "Plan to Bag Rivers May Not Float," Eric Bailey's fine March
2 story on entrepreneur Ric Davidge's scheme to "suck fresh water
from two North Coast rivers, stow it in massive poly-fiber bags . . .
and tow the floating sacks . . . south . . . to slake San Diego's
thirst," I recalled Henry David Thoreau's reaction to a similar
scheme, on a much smaller scale, to install pipes to transport water
from his beloved Walden Pond to homes in the nearby village. It
climaxes with his lament on the degradation of the pond and the
destruction of the surrounding woods:</LD>
<LD>   "My Muse may be excused if she is silent henceforth. How can you
expect the birds to sing when their groves are cut down? Now the
trunks of trees on the bottom, and the old log canoe, and the dark
surrounding woods, are gone, and the villagers, who scarcely know
where it lies, instead of going to the pond to bathe or drink, are
thinking to bring its water, which should be as sacred as the Ganges
at least, to the village in a pipe, to wash their dishes with!--to
earn their Walden by the turning of a cock or drawing of a plug!"</LD>
<LD>   Richard Abcarian</LD>
<TE>   Venice</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The entrepreneurs who want to ship fresh water in gigantic bags
from Mendocino County rivers to San Diego need some way to generate
strong political support from the described urban refugees,
environmental activists and communal residents of the northern
county. Perhaps by finding some way to offer the area's residents
something those folks would value as much as the south appreciates
fresh water. For instance, if marijuana could be legalized for
Mendocino County, the good people of that region might think it a
splendid idea to export a little of the river water that was destined
for the Pacific Ocean anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Newman</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The proposal to haul bagged water from northern rivers to Southern
California would be manifold less productive in saving water than
would a simple adoption of xeriscaping. Such measures have received
scant attention.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita Valley, where we are temporarily residing, has done
much in this direction and is indeed beautiful. But the coastal areas
appear to have done almost nothing. It really needs to be pushed as
demands for water increase. The greatest consumption of water goes to
landscaping efforts with lawns, shrubbery and trees that emulate
those in areas of high precipitation.</TE>

<LD>Re "Students, Then Teachers," editorial, March 4: Perhaps the
bargaining table isn't the proper place for every issue regarding
materials and curriculum, but let's set the record straight on one
aspect of your argument. You express the fear that "older reading
teachers" might want to "return to the whole-language approach
although scientific research has proved that phonics-based lessons
are the key to reading success for most children."</LD>
<LD>   I recall vividly the day that teachers in my district were told
that (based on scientific research) phonics and skills-based
instruction would be replaced by whole language. We all left the
meeting shaking our heads and saying "test scores will go down, and
they'll blame us."</LD>
<LD>   My wife teaches first grade. She and others like her continued
using the phonics-based materials and other material that they
purchased themselves in spite of the district mandates that this
material was obsolete and shouldn't be used.</LD>
<TE>   Whole-language reading instruction was a glaring example of
top-down "reform" that involved almost no teacher input. The great
majority of us applauded the return to phonics-based instruction. The
bargaining table may not be the place, but well-meaning "reformers"
would do well to ask the teachers once in a while what they think.
Even the "older" teachers.</TE>

<TE>   Without consulting teachers, the state mandated that high school
seniors graduating in June 2003 will have passed geometry. In my
LAUSD classroom the failure rates for Algebra 1 and geometry are
between 20% and 60%. Previous graduates took less-demanding basic
math and pre-algebra to satisfy the two-year math requirement.
Without any teacher consultation these classes were recently
canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers need to be consulted so students are able to take the
appropriate courses. In June 2003 the geometry mandate will cause a
substantial number of seniors statewide to receive a certificate of
attendance instead of a diploma.</TE>

<TE>   Your editorial expressed concern that teachers unions are seeking
to interfere with the selection of student textbooks. You did not
mention that college professors are at liberty to assign whatever
text they want for their classes. Why not grant that same courtesy to
the dedicated and hard-working K-12 teachers? And who is better
qualified to speak for the teachers than their unions?</TE>
<TE>   You imply that Sacramento knows best what to do in the classrooms.
But legislators are susceptible to influences too--for example, from
individuals who might oppose the teaching of the theory of evolution
in science classes. Do you really want to leave the selection of
textbooks only in their hands?</TE>
<TE>   You wrote, "For years, the LAUSD contract gave teachers the right
to choose their classroom assignments based on seniority." You
neglected to mention that that concession was granted to teachers for
not going on strike in 1993 when the district cut salaries by 10%.</TE>

<TE>   Why shouldn't teachers have a large say in determining which
textbooks are adopted? We're the ones who are in the classroom with
students every day. Principals and school board members aren't. We're
the ones who take the heat for test scores. We've also been the ones
who have been forced to implement, despite our skepticism, every new
education theory that has rounded the bend in California, such as
writing to read, invented spelling, whole language and new math.
Later, when these "innovations" are seen as failures, it's the
teachers who are blamed for them.</TE>
<TE>   Most veteran teachers never abandoned proven teaching methods, so
your claim that older teachers might reinstate whole language in
place of phonics was particularly laughable. In having a major vote
in selecting textbooks, teachers are putting the students first. And
in the future, please refrain from using the LAUSD and its problems
to draw conclusions about public education in the entire state.</TE>

<HD>Death Penalty Reforms Proposed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Myths Aside, Death Row Isn't Filled With Innocents" (Commentary,
Feb. 26), Joshua Marquis spins a few myths of his own. First, death
row isn't "filled" with innocents, but no one suggests that it is.
What we know is that nearly 100 innocent people have been released
from death row since 1973. What we do not know--in part because of
laws that Marquis defends that deny DNA testing to check the
facts--is how many other innocents are on death row and how many may
have been executed.</LD>
<LD>   Second, concern about the use of the death penalty is not
premised, as Marquis suggests, on the boogeyman of the "bloodthirsty
prosecutor." The concern that runs across the political spectrum is
based on the facts, including a defect that Marquis fails to mention:
ineffective defense counsel. Those who know the system best know that
with the current state of indigent defense in many parts of the
country, the biggest myth about the death penalty is the myth of
infallibility.</LD>
<TE>   Third, Marquis says we need to worry more about guilty people
wrongfully freed than innocents wrongfully imprisoned and executed,
but he offers no data and ignores a key fact: We have seen cases
where killers went on rampages while innocent people were in jail for
their crimes. There is no surer way to have a dangerous killer on the
loose than to lock up the wrong man for the crime, refuse to consider
further evidence and then close the case file.</TE>
<TE>   I have sponsored the bipartisan Innocence Protection Act--modest
reforms that would not abolish the death penalty but would take a few
steps toward making good on the Constitution's promise of effective
representation of counsel for the defendant and would make DNA
testing available to convicted offenders in appropriate cases.
Marquis claims that the bill's procedural reforms "would effectively
prevent states from ever seeking the death penalty." As a former
prosecutor I am troubled to hear a prosecutor claim that competent
defense representation and broader defense access to DNA evidence,
which competent prosecutors use to determine the truth, would make
his job impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Marquis also asserts that the bill has "failed to gain traction."
The Innocence Protection Act is supported by about half the members
of the House, 25 senators and many state officials, including judges
and prosecutors. Our co-sponsors are Republicans and Democrats, and
supporters and opponents of the death penalty. I only wish that more
of my legislative initiatives "failed" like this one.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick Leahy</TE>
<TE>   Chair, Judiciary Committee</TE>
<TE>   (D-Vt.), Washington</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marquis writes that the Oregon Supreme Court's reversal of 68% of
death verdicts does not suggest that "innocent" people are being
sentenced to death but only that courts are reversing judgments for
"hyper-procedural errors" such as "faulty jury instructions."
Actually, the new study by Columbia law professor James S. Liebman
reveals that the leading cause of reversals nationwide is
incompetence of defense counsel. Faulty instructions, the
second-largest cause, are hardly hyper-procedural errors, however,
since reviewing courts reverse only if the outcome might have been
different had the erroneous jury instruction not been given.
Judgments reversed for erroneous jury instructions are invariably
remanded for retrial, and 7% of death row defendants whose
convictions are reversed are acquitted at their retrials. Another 82%
receive a sentence of less than death.</TE>
<TE>   Marquis offers Oregon as a "good example" of low use of the death
penalty because it has only 25 inmates on death row. Those 25,
however, rank Oregon sixth in the nation when compared with Oregon's
homicide rate. Its high rate of reversals (11.1% higher than average)
is consistent with Liebman's thesis that the states that charge the
highest proportion of their homicides as death penalty cases also
have the highest error rates. The data are also consistent for
Virginia (29th in the nation for death sentencing rate, with a 10.3%
lower-than-average rate of reversals) and California (31st
nationwide, with a 14.3% lower-than-average rate of reversals).</TE>
<TE>   It's time for prosecutors to stop whining and start working for
consistent standards to narrow the overuse of the death penalty. The
bottom line of Liebman's groundbreaking research is incontrovertible:
Prosecutors are stuffing more death penalty cases down the throat of
our criminal justice system than it can possibly digest, and
indigestion is the chief cause of reversible error.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Disabled Decry Plan to Alter Rider Service," March 2:</LD>
<LD>   The principal reason for service changes by Access Services is our
responsibility, in light of recent federal court decisions throughout
the country, to ensure all federal Americans With Disabilities Act
mandates are fully met. The Access Services board's actions of Feb.
25 did just that. In response to community input, prior to and during
this meeting, the board directed staff to work with its community
advisory committee to further modify the proposed fare and
reservation recommendations.</LD>
<LD>   Two important non-ADA-mandated services are offered as a part of
our revised system. One would offer a same-day option for short trips
at a base cost of $1.50 for seven miles or less, and another would
allow regularly scheduled rides of any length throughout the county
for a flat rate of $1.80.</LD>
<TE>   Moving from a cookie-cutter approach to a system of multiple
service options not only ensures that L.A. County is protecting the
civil rights of its paratransit riders but also offers distinct,
non-mandated services. This new system allows our riders greater
choice, flexibility and a level of service not offered anywhere else
in the U.S. while ensuring a more efficient use of scarce taxpayer
dollars.</TE>

<LD>I want to thank the city of Los Angeles for hosting the 17th L.A.
Marathon. It was a fantastic, world-class event that would not have
been possible without the hard work and support of numerous
individual and organizations, including the race organizers,
volunteers, sponsors, local government, the LAPD and the LAFD.
Hopefully our contributions to the local economy will help compensate
for all of the effort.</LD>
<LD>   A special note of thanks has to go out to all of the people of
L.A. To the kids high-fiving us, the folks with hoses, the Latina
ladies singing "Allez, Allez" with the accordion, the gospel singers,
the reggae musicians who played in front of their shop, the Korean
singers, the rappers and other performers, the Metro conductor on the
Red Line and all of the people along the course who cheered: You made
this event special and kept a lot of us going when we were running on
empty.</LD>
<LD>   It's not always easy for someone from San Francisco to tip the hat
to L.A., but on behalf of all of the runners from across the country
and the world who came to participate, let me say thank you, Los
Angeles! See you next year!</LD>

<TE>   I participated in the L.A. bike tour this past marathon weekend.</TE>
<TE>   My daughter and I spent the night in L.A., took in an Imax movie,
had dinner at a great downtown restaurant and had breakfast at a
coffee shop on the marathon route so we could cheer the runners on.
Altogether, I spent about $250. I'm just one person of the 23,000
runners and 15,000 riders who spent more than their entry fee in the
city.</TE>
<TE>   It seems to me just sour grapes to complain about the city's
spending for such a well-attended and exciting event as the marathon
(March 2). Not to mention how many more people are able to
participate, between participants, volunteers and coordinators. Long
live the L.A. Marathon!</TE>

<LD>Re "The State of California vs. the Catholic Church," Voices, March
2: After reading that the state of California intends to interfere
with the Roman Catholic Church as to its moral stand on
contraception, I wonder where the liberals' "separation of church and
state" philosophy fits into the big picture.</LD>
<LD>   The warning must be given to every religious entity in California
and the nation that if the strongest church in the land can be told
what it can preach and enforce within its religion, then everyone is
subject to the same lack of liberty. Furthermore, it must be noted
that the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. is the largest religious
charity in the world, and even surpasses the U.S. government, as it,
along with other missions throughout the world, feeds, clothes,
houses and, most important, educates more poor than any organization
on the face of the globe.</LD>
<LD>   Edward T. Graney</LD>
<TE>   Dana Point</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Curry argues that Catholic Charities should be exempted
from laws contrary to Catholic dogma. He neglected to mention that CC
receives 62% of its funding from government sources and only 12% from
the church and community (1999 figures from the CC Web site). By any
reasonable interpretation, the 1st Amendment prohibits government
funding of purely sectarian functions.</TE>
<TE>   He is, however, correct that the granting of exemptions based on a
governmental declaration that certain organizations are religious in
nature is a violation of the separation of church and state. In this
case the government would be abetting the coercion of employees to
adhere to a sectarian doctrine. Why, then, shouldn't anyone who
objects to a law for any reason be given an exemption? Where in the
Constitution are religions placed above the laws of the people of the
United States?</TE>

<HD>Revving Up Senate Bill on Fuel Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Government Should Steer Clear of the Fuel Economy Issue"
(Commentary, March 1) relies on an outdated argument to suggest that
much-needed new fuel economy standards will cost lives. In fact, the
Kerry-Hollings fuel economy provisions now before the Senate will
save lives, fuel and emissions.</LD>
<LD>   William Niskanen and Peter Van Doren base their conclusions about
safety on a study using data from 1993, before air bags were standard
equipment and before SUVs took over our roadways, endangering other
drivers. When the methods of the original study were duplicated using
recent crash data, the update showed no increase in crash fatalities.</LD>
<LD>   When fuel economy standards were upgraded in the 1980s, new
technology, not weight reduction, was the primary tool. If new
standards are set, only the heaviest vehicles will lose weight,
improving highway safety for all drivers.</LD>
<TE>   The Senate fuel economy bill also requires safety improvements for
vehicle compatibility and rollover crashes, which will save thousands
of lives each year. Readers should not be scared by a safety myth
spread out of self-interest by the auto industry.</TE>

<LD>''Latin America Is Unsettled by Washington's Rhetoric'' (Opinion,
March 3) clearly has a limited view of our client states, concluding
that Colombia is ''the hemisphere's most troubled country.'' As J.P.
Slavin points out in the same Opinion section (''As Aristide's
Support Ebbs, Tensions Grow''), a Haitian intellectual states, ''We
are again part of a mad dream.'' For, despite decades of oversight,
tutorship, occupation and winking at outrages by the Duvalier family,
Haiti (so poor it can't even fund an export drug trade) remains our
most disastrous foreign assistance program. And there is no end in
sight.</LD>
<LD>   Is it any wonder, therefore, that more and more doubts are now
beginning to surface about how, down the road, good will result from
our efforts in Afghanistan?</LD>

<HD>Eastside Light Rail Gets the Green Light</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Ending Eastside Transit Jam" (editorial, March 1) mischaracterizes
my position on the proposed light rail in Boyle Heights. I would like
to set the record straight on my position.</LD>
<LD>   Since joining the council in July 1999, I have always advocated
for the Eastside light rail project. I believe a permanent
transportation solution is long overdue on the Eastside. I joined
Rep. Xavier Becerra, Supervisor Gloria Molina and then-Assembly
Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa in pursuing state funding from Gov. Gray
Davis to close the budget gap for the Eastside light rail. I also
pushed MTA engineers to put the rail underground in Boyle Heights as
a safety measure. A quick glance at the first 10 pages of last week's
adopted Eastside Light Rail Environmental Impact Report public
comment section provides detailed suggestions I have made in the past
two years to improve the project's safety.</LD>
<LD>   Your editorial states that I should be leading the fight to
improve transportation, rather than "grumbling." That is an
oversimplification of the issue.</LD>
<TE>   There was a genuine debate in the community over the location of
one of the stations on the line. At no point did I support moving the
final station in Boyle Heights. I supported the MTA's first chosen
site, and I understand that the MTA board ultimately voted to move
the site. Either site had some negative implications for local
businesses, and the fact that one business owner was vocal regarding
these implications did not play a role in my decision. I weighed in
with my opinion as I was expected to do, but I never said I would
pull my support from the project if the MTA opted not to build the
station at the site I preferred, as your editorial implied.</TE>
<TE>   I look forward to the day service begins to the Eastside.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>My family and I happened to be among the passengers delayed at LAX by
the mock grenade in the luggage (March 5). After spending well over
an hour motionless on the upper level sidewalk with no information at
all, we were suddenly commanded by barking policemen that we must
move to the lower level of Terminal 1 as soon as possible so that the
object could be removed. Many passengers had large numbers of bags on
carts and were funneled into just two elevators. The escalator was
not working and people who went down that way had to roll and drag
their bags down the steps.</LD>
<LD>   Virtually no one from the airlines or the airport security was
making any effort to help the passengers or direct them where to go.
An older woman who asked for a wheelchair was told basically to
forget it. Occasionally, a policeman would come in and shout out some
instructions, inaudible to most, through cupped hands. When the scare
was over, the same chaos was repeated in reverse.</LD>
<LD>   If this is to be a regular event at LAX (as it seems to have
become), the authorities should develop plans to provide better
information and help to passengers, with personnel posted at
stairways and elevators, directing people and providing assistance to
the elderly. Also, perhaps they can figure out some way to make use
of the PA system!</LD>

<HD>Aetna Is Target of a Proxy Challenge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Aetna Inc., which lost $279.6 million last year, said investor
Herbert Denton was mounting a proxy challenge after helping oust a
previous chief executive at the second-biggest U.S. health insurer.</LD>
<LD>   Providence Investors, led by Denton, has nominated a slate of
candidates for three board seats, according to a filing Aetna made
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Providence owns 1,000
shares of Aetna stock, the filing said.</LD>
<LD>   Denton, president of Providence Capital Inc., said Aetna's board
was wrong to hire CEO John Rowe, a physician who had never run a
public company. Denton criticized the board for rejecting a
$10-billion takeover offer two years ago and accused it of ignoring
investors.</LD>
<TE>   Criticism by Denton and other investors forced the February 2000
resignation of CEO Richard Huber.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna, once the biggest U.S. health insurer, last month reported
its fourth consecutive quarterly loss and a loss for the year as the
company battled rising medical costs and had expenses for cutting
6,000 jobs, or 16% of its work force.</TE>
<TE>   Rowe ran Mount Sinai NYU Health System, which had $1.8 billion in
revenue and 31,000 employees, before joining Aetna in September 2000.
Hired to turn the company around, Rowe has dropped almost 4 million
customers by focusing on profitable accounts and raised premiums to
stem losses. He's promised investors a profit this year.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna defended the board and urged shareholders to back its
nominees at the April 26 annual meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Hartford, Conn.-based company rose 50 cents to
$37.24 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Says It Will Vote Against HP-Compaq Merger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a potential setback to Hewlett-Packard Co.'s bid to merge with
Compaq Computer Co., the California Public Employees' Retirement
System on Friday said it will vote against the combination when it
comes up for shareholder approval March 19.</LD>
<LD>   CalPERS, which owns 7.6 million shares of HP and 6.5 million
shares of Compaq, said a merger would distract HP from its core
business. In a statement released on its Web site, it also cited the
"high premium being paid, the negative financial consequences of the
merger and significant integration risks and opportunity costs
related to losing focus on HP's core strengths."</LD>
<LD>   "Basically, we'd rather be safe than sorry," said Pat Macht, a
spokeswoman for the Sacramento-based pension fund that manages $152
billion in retirement money for 1.2 million members. "It's a high
premium, unprecedented in the tech industry. And if the merger goes
through, there's no question that there will be great costs as
competitors try to take market share, which will be distracting from
their integration."</LD>
<TE>   Although CalPERS' stake is not significant compared with  that of
other major investors, many look to the fund for guidance.  The
CalPERS announcement comes days after HP snagged support from
Institutional Shareholder Services, an advisor to large investors.
ISS clients hold 23% of HP's shares.</TE>
<TE>   The hotly contested merger, championed by HP Chief Executive Carly
Fiorina, has divided shareholders. Since the merger was announced in
December, Walter Hewlett and David Packard--sons of HP founders--have
lobbied against it, saying it would further enmesh the company in the
troubled PC market.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS, in its statement, was careful to distinguish its opinion
of the merger from its opinion of Fiorina, who has staked her career
at HP on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to state that this decision is not a referendum on
HP's management team or its CEO, Carly Fiorina," the statement said.
"Rather it's solely based on the merits of this transaction as it
relates to CalPERS' portfolio."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Palo Alto-based HP gained 59 cents Friday to $20.59, and
Houston-based Compaq's stock rose 65 cents to $11.80, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>WellPoint to Favor Nonprescription Form of Claritin</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Move by Blue Cross of California parent could
lead to more OTC versions of other allergy drugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE and RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The multibillion-dollar business of prescription allergy drugs took a
sharp turn Friday as WellPoint Health Networks Inc. said it plans to
steer allergy patients from prescription medications to
over-the-counter versions of Claritin. The announcement came as
Schering-Plough Corp. disclosed plans to market Claritin as a
nonprescription drug when its patent expires in December.</LD>
<LD>   WellPoint's action, if followed by other health insurers, could
force the marketers of competing drugs Allegra and Zyrtec to offer
nonprescription versions before patents on those strong-selling
medications expire.</LD>
<LD>   Health insurers would save millions of dollars as a result, but
consumers with prescription drug coverage could end up paying more
for the popular allergy medications.</LD>
<TE>   WellPoint, the parent of Blue Cross of California, said it will
raise the co-payment on monthly Allegra and Zyrtec prescriptions to
$30 to $40, up from $17. Schering hasn't said what it would charge
for nonprescription Claritin. But analysts said it may exceed the
co-payment on prescription Claritin.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Claritin users with prescription drug coverage aren't
likely to gripe about paying more for an over-the-counter version,
said Peter Boland, a Berkeley-based management consultant and
health-care industry analyst. Any increase in price would be offset
by the convenience of picking up the medication at the store without
first seeing a doctor for a prescription, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Uninsured consumers stand to benefit as the price of
nonprescription Claritin is expected to drop significantly from the
prescription price of $80 to $90 for a month's supply.</TE>
<TE>   Claritin and its competitors do not cause drowsiness, a drawback
of the antihistamines currently sold without a prescription. Claritin
is Schering's top-selling drug, generating $2.3 billion last year.
Americans spend more than $4.7billion on the three medications
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Boland expects other insurers to follow WellPoint's lead, creating
a dilemma for Aventis, marketer of Allegra, and Pfizer Inc., which
markets Zyrtec. Faced with a higher co-payment, Allegra and Zyrtec
users could switch to the cheaper, nonprescription Claritin.</TE>
<TE>   A federal advisory panel, acting on a petition from WellPoint,
last May urged the Food and Drug Administration to force Schering,
Aventis and Pfizer to sell their allergy medications over the
counter. WellPoint, eager to cut costs, argued that the medications
were as "safe as taking a sugar pill." The FDA hasn't acted on the
petition.</TE>
<TE>   Schering, which fought the petition last year, reversed its
position as the expiration of its patent on Claritin loomed. Two
other drug companies, units of Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc. and American
Home Products Corp., have filed applications with the FDA to market
generic, nonprescription versions of Claritin.</TE>
<TE>   Schering sued in federal court to block the generics, arguing that
the generics violate a separate patent that does not expire until
2004. Johnson &amp; Johnson and American Home Products are fighting the
suit. The companies said Friday that competition from Schering in the
over-the-counter market won't change their plans.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmaceutical industry analysts said they did not expect Allegra
and Zyrtec to move over the counter, at least not right away. But
they said nonprescription versions may appear before their patents
expired.</TE>
<TE>   Viren Mehta of New York-based Mehta Partners said he does not
expect Zyrtec and Allegra to go over the counter. The patents on
those medications expire in 2007 and 2013, respectively. But, he
said, the market for those medications just got tougher. "The whole
class of allergy drugs faces a significant threat," Mehta said.</TE>
<TE>   Trevor M. Polischuk, an analyst with Lehman Bros. in New York,
said some insurers may be reluctant to raise co-payments, but people
who take allergy medications tend to be profitable patients in
general. He said they tend not to have serious chronic diseases, such
as heart disease, that are expensive for health insurers.</TE>
<TE>   "They might not want to alienate these people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Kaiser Permanente, PacifiCare Health Systems
Inc. and Humana Inc. said they had no plans to increase co-payments
on allergy medications.</TE>
<TE>   Besides bumping up the co-payment on prescription allergy drugs,
WellPoint said it won't cover Allegra or Zyrtec unless Claritin does
not work for the patient. WellPoint has not yet decided if it will
cover Clarinex, a new prescription version of Claritin.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint shares gained $3.09 to $120.59 and Schering-Plough
shares fell $1.96 to $34 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Enron CEO's Contract Is Challenged</HD>
<DH>Regulations: SEC asks Bankruptcy Court judge to reject
proposed $1.32-million compensation package.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS and THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission asked a Bankruptcy Court judge
Friday to toss out a proposed $1.32-million employment contract for
Enron Corp.'s new acting chief executive, Stephen F. Cooper, as too
rich, filled with loopholes and rife with potential conflicts of
interest.</LD>
<LD>   In a strongly worded court filing, the SEC declared that the terms
of Cooper's agreement "cast doubt on the fairness of Enron's handling
of its bankruptcy case and on the bankruptcy process as a whole."</LD>
<LD>   An Enron lawyer said many of the provisions that alarmed the SEC
have been removed from a new version of the contract that will be
filed soon with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, where the
Enron case is being handled.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC said the contract should not be approved because Cooper
and his turnaround associates would be paid large fees with little
court oversight. And, because they are hired as independent
contractors but are indemnified by Enron, they would be protected
from lawsuits without a corresponding fiduciary responsibility to the
company, regulators said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Cooper would have potential conflicts because some of
the members of Enron's creditor committee are current or former
clients of Cooper's New York consulting firm, Zolfo Cooper, or are
investors in an equity fund that Cooper controls, which invests in
distressed companies, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also objected to a $5-million bonus that Cooper would
receive if he crafts a reorganization or liquidation plan that wins
creditor approval. The agency pointed out that he would be eligible
for the bonus even if the plan fails to win court approval. Fees to
Cooper and associates, who get a minimum of $864,000 a year, could be
adjusted without the court's approval, the filing said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not in the business of telling public companies who to
hire. However, we do object to the terms of this contract," SEC
lawyer Alistaire Bambach said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly haven't seen this type of agreement proposed in a
large corporate bankruptcy case," she said. "It seems to me to be
extremely overreaching."</TE>
<TE>   Although the SEC filing contends "we do not pass on the wisdom of
Enron's choice of Cooper as CEO," the document cited a 1994 dispute
in which a bankruptcy judge denied Cooper nearly $750,000 in fees and
expenses in his handling of the restructuring of CF Holdings Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said the court denied the fees because Cooper was slow in
disclosing that he personally invested $2 million into a partnership
that was planning to buy CF Holdings. Cooper was a financial advisor
to CF Holdings at the time, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper was not available for comment and a call to Zolfo Cooper
was not returned.</TE>
<TE>   But Martin J. Bienenstock, a partner at New York's Weil, Gotshal &amp;
Manges law firm and the head of Enron's legal team, said the contract
terms have changed substantially since the document was filed with
the court and many of the SEC's objections already have been
addressed.</TE>
<TE>   Bienenstock said there was "a regrettable lack of communication"
between the SEC and lawyers involved in the bankruptcy. A phone call
to Bienenstock or creditors committee lawyers would have headed off
many of the errors in the SEC's objection, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "How they could have hauled off and done this [without making such
calls], is really unfortunate," Bienenstock said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney said the revised contract clearly establishes Cooper
as a corporate officer with fiduciary duties to the company, and not
an independent contractor.</TE>
<TE>   As to Cooper's alleged conflicts of interest, his ties to creditor
committee members would only pose a problem if he tried to lead
investigations or lawsuits against Enron creditors, Bienenstock said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Enron realized early on that the taint from the scandal
would keep the company--no matter who ran it--from having any
credibility in suing its former customers or creditors, so it
petitioned the court to have that job carried out by outside
examiners.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Warren, a bankruptcy law professor at Harvard Law
School, said it was unusual for the regulators to intervene so
forcefully.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen the SEC weigh in this way in similar
circumstances," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One SEC jab at Cooper in the filing notes that he must work only
35 hours a week to earn his $1.32million a year. Enron spokeswoman
Karen Denne said Cooper is putting in 16- to 18-hour days, four days
a week in Houston before heading home to New York each weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Bienenstock, addressing any concerns about Cooper's work habits in
light of the 35-hour workweek clause in his contract, said: "He works
35 hours in two days."</TE>
<TE>   Rivera Brooks reported from Los Angeles and Mulligan from New
York.</TE>

<HD>Global to Slash More Jobs, Shut 71 Offices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. said Friday it will cut 1,600 more jobs, close
71 offices and lower some executives' pay to further reduce expenses
while the company is in bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   Hamilton, Bermuda-based Global Crossing, which operates a
worldwide fiber-optic communications network, also said it may sell
its conferencing business and network system in the United Kingdom to
raise additional cash.</LD>
<LD>   The company still is seeking a buyer for its Global Marine unit,
which installs and maintains undersea fiber-optic cables and was put
up for sale late last year.</LD>
<TE>   Global Crossing said the moves will slash operating expenses 40%,
to about $900 million this year, excluding costs associated with Asia
Global Crossing. Publicly traded Asia Global Crossing operates
networks serving the Far East, is 59% owned by Global Crossing and is
not in bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The new layoffs will hit hardest in Global Crossing's
administration and sales divisions and will cut the company's payroll
to fewer than 6,000 employees by the end of the month, down from
about 15,000 at the beginning of 2001. Under a recently announced
voluntary buyout, 754 employees left Global Crossing on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "They're doing what they have to do to become a lean, functioning
company, and that means doing a lot of cutting," said Jeffrey Kagan,
an Atlanta-based telecommunications consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "Will they be able to emerge [from bankruptcy] as a fighter and a
competitor or will they be acquired? That's the big question, and we
don't know yet."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the company's assets have attracted just two formal
offers, one from a shareholder group and the other from two Singapore
companies that have offered to invest $750 million for a 79% stake in
the reorganized company.</TE>
<TE>   Two Los Angeles-based turnaround firms, Gores Technology Group and
Platinum Equity, plan to submit separate bids for Global Crossing
next week. Another firm, investment company Texas Pacific Group, also
may be preparing an offer, Bloomberg News reported Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing became the first company to build a worldwide
network using private funds, but took on billions of dollars in debt.
Ultimately, lagging sales and increased competition undercut Global
Crossing's ability to keep up with interest payments, and on Jan. 28,
the company filed for Chapter 11 reorganization, becoming the
nation's fourth-largest bankruptcy in terms of assets.</TE>
<TE>   Bondholders and creditors, owed at least $12 billion, want Global
Crossing to preserve as much cash as possible in case the company is
liquidated and its assets distributed among the various creditors. As
of last month, Global Crossing said it had an estimated $700 million
in available cash.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the expense reductions, Global Crossing will cut
capital spending to $200 million this year, down from $3.2 billion
last year, when the company finished the bulk of its network
construction.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it will save an additional $150 million a year in
lease payments by shuttering 71 offices.Global Crossing would not
identify the offices to be closed or hit with layoffs. The company's
largest U.S. operations are in Rochester, N.Y.; Detroit; Denver and
Madison, N.J. The company's soon-to-be-vacated Beverly Hills office
has been reduced to fewer than 100 employees through earlier layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Chief Executive John Legere also said he will take
a 30% salary cut, to $770,000 annually, until the company emerges
from bankruptcy. Global Crossing said other senior managers also will
take a pay cut, but a spokesman said each executive "will make that
decision based on his or her own situation."</TE>
<TE>   Legere's compensation package has been widely criticized because
it included a $3.5-million signing bonus and severance pay of up to
$3 million when he left Asia Global Crossing to become CEO of the
parent company. In addition, the companies forgave a personal loan of
$15 million, canceling out the last $10 million just months before
Global Crossing's bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The new bidder, Texas Pacific, has $3.5 billion in assets and a
history of reorganizing airlines. Its founder, David Bonderman,
revived Continental Airlines Inc. when it was in bankruptcy
proceedings and then sold the fifth-largest U.S. airline. Bonderman
also invested in America West Holdings Corp. and is chairman of
Ryanair Holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Friday, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce
Committee said the panel plans to seek a wide range of documents from
Global Crossing, whose accounting practices are under investigation
by the FBI and Securities and Exchange Commission. The spokesman
declined to elaborate.</TE>

<HD>Lights Out for 284 Kmart Stores</HD>
<DH>Retail: Sixteen outlets will close in California, with more
closures predicted nationwide. 22,000 will lose jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST and ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. said Friday that it would close 284 stores, including 16
in California, retreating in some areas where it has suffered the
most blistering competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts were expecting Kmart to shutter 400 or more stores, and
on Friday they predicted a second wave of closures that could claim
at least a couple hundred more stores as the nation's second-largest
discount retailer restructures under bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   Kmart said it would continue to monitor the financial performance
of other stores.</LD>
<TE>   "While additional store closings are possible, we do not
anticipate another closing of this size in the near term," spokesman
Jack Ferry said.</TE>
<TE>   Retail experts say the stores, which will begin closing in May,
probably won't stay vacant for long. But that didn't soothe the
stores' loyal customers.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Pearson, a Kmart shopper for half a century, was crushed to
learn that the Compton store, her favorite, was on the closure list.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where I'm going to go now," said Pearson, adding
that the store's wide aisles make it easier for her to shop in her
wheelchair. "It makes me want to cry."</TE>
<TE>   The closures will reduce Kmart's store count to about 1,800 and
means that 22,000 employees--slightly less than 10% of the total work
force nationwide--will lose jobs. The Troy, Mich.-based company said
that the store closings would cost as much as $1.3 billion and that
more than $1 billion in merchandise would be liquidated.</TE>
<TE>   As a percentage, hardest hit will be Southern states, including
Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, where Wal-Mart is based.
California, which analysts say is one of Kmart's strongest markets
and where the Wal-Mart juggernaut has been slower to advance, will be
less affected.</TE>
<TE>   But the closings in California will nonetheless be strongly felt
in certain communities, such as Compton, where residents have long
complained about the flight of major retailers and the blight they've
left behind.</TE>
<TE>   Truck driver Dwain Honeywood, 43, was visibly upset when he
learned that the Compton store and a Los Angeles store where he also
shopped were targeted for closure.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seems like they're closing the ones in our neighborhood,"
said Honeywood, a Compton resident, who bought earrings for his wife
at the Kmart at 11507 S. Western Ave. in Los Angeles. He said Kmart
seemed to be targeting minority neighborhoods, a charge Kmart denied.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll probably start going to Wal-Mart," Honeywood said. "We
don't have a choice."</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said the company was not targeting any specific population
and still was committed to its urban locations. Indeed, some of the
company's better-performing stores are in urban settings, spokesman
Ferry said.</TE>
<TE>   "The review was more along the lines of how the stores were
performing financially and not trying to vacate any certain
population group," Ferry said. "There's no way we want to move out of
prime real estate in urban locations."</TE>
<TE>   Competition from Wal-Mart and Target Corp. helped push the
struggling Kmart into bankruptcy. Wal-Mart regularly beats Kmart's
prices, while Target offers trendier products, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart did not fare as well as its competitors during the last
holiday shopping season, then suffered a staggering blow when its
only food distributor, Fleming Cos., temporarily stopped shipments
after Kmart missed a monthly payment. Within days, Kmart sought
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said it would ask a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Chicago to
approve the store closures at a hearing March 20.</TE>
<TE>   Although analysts say the closures are necessary if Kmart is to
right itself, the company also must correct other problems, such as
empty shelves and dirty stores, that were major reasons for Kmart's
long erosion of market share and bankruptcy filing in January.</TE>
<TE>   Another key to Kmart's success will be holding on to its
highest-profile brands. This month, the company asked the Bankruptcy
Court's permission to keep its agreements with these suppliers,
including Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. and Walt Disney Co.
Martha Stewart had no comment about the store closure announcement.</TE>
<TE>   The company might be staggering store closures to buy time to
attempt to sell store leases to other retailers that may be
interested in moving into the vacated properties.</TE>
<TE>   Potential buyers include Kohl's Corp., Home Depot Inc., Lowe's
Cos. and even Ralphs Grocery Co., experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "All of them are actively looking for blue-light specials," said
Jess Bressi, a bankruptcy attorney in Irvine, referring to the
instant discounts Kmart has offered its customers.</TE>
<TE>   The vacancies in the state "provide another great opportunity for
another wave of retailers to get into California," said Ian Brown,
senior vice president of the retail division at Grubb &amp; Elllis in
Newport Beach. "I don't think you'll have to worry about vacant
Kmarts."</TE>
<TE>   Kmart shares closed at $1.29, up 5 cents, on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Job News Lifts Stocks as Bond Yields Surge</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A better-than-expected employment report sent stocks higher Friday,
allowing Wall Street to extend a rally driven by a steady stream of
positive economic news.</LD>
<LD>   But the rally in blue chips was held back by another surge in
Treasury bond yields, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Tech stocks had a strong day, and the Nasdaq composite index
closed just below its high for the session.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 47.12, or 0.5%, at
10,572.49, for a five-day gain of 203 points, or nearly 2%.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow had been up as much as 138 points Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a very nice run. But now we're hesitating a little
bit," said Charles White, portfolio manager at Avatar Associates.
"This is the market's way of telling you that it needs more
information, more certainty about the economy and [corporate]
earnings before it's going to break out much further."</TE>
<TE>   Broader indicators also rose, with the technology-focused Nasdaq
composite index advancing 48.04 points, or 2.6%, to 1,929.67. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 0.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Advancing shares led decliners 5 to 4 on the New York Stock
Exchange and 23 to 13 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, Nasdaq rose 7%, and the S&amp;P added 2.9%.</TE>
<TE>   The gains were the latest in a series of advances on upbeat
economic news. Wall Street reacted positively to a Labor Department
report Friday showing the nation's unemployment rate slipped to 5.5%
in February. Businesses added 66,000 new jobs, breaking a string of
losses that averaged 146,000 a month since the recession started in
March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "For unemployment to be improving this quarter, earlier than
expected, is very encouraging," said Barry Hyman, chief investment
strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. "It gives us the continuing
story that the economy has turned the corner."</TE>
<TE>   Tech stocks were helped by announcements from two bellwethers:
Intel rose $1.19 to $34.17 after forecasting first-quarter revenue in
line with expectations. And Sun Microsystems jumped $1.17 to $10
after the computer hardware and software maker said it expected to
return to profitability in the spring quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Among other tech issues, Brocade Communications rose $2.54 to
$29.48, QLogic jumped $4.70 to $51.36, and PeopleSoft gained $3.35 to
$36.59.</TE>
<TE>   Blue chips were mixed, as rising bond yields gave some investors
pause. The 10-year Treasury note yield jumped to an eight-month high
of 5.32% from 5.22% on Thursday, as bond traders dumped Treasuries,
fearing a strong economy may mean tighter credit soon.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many financial stocks were higher, including American
Express, which gained 96 cents to $40.47, and Bank of America, up 85
cents to $67.83.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors, which has run up about 16% in the last two weeks,
retreated, falling 70 cents to $60.71.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said investors were shifting into technology after
spending most of the last two weeks focused on blue chips. Although
technology has advanced, its gains have been more modest than those
of so-called old-economy stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The blue chip Dow is up 5.5% for the year. By contrast, the Nasdaq
is still down 1.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Although the market's tone has improved considerably in recent
sessions, as investors start thinking about buying stocks again,
there is still a lot of hesitance, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   With some stocks at their highest prices this year, many would-be
buyers are nervous that the market might be advancing too quickly.
They want to see more evidence that corporate profits are
strengthening when first-quarter reports come out next month.</TE>
<TE>   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average closed up 2% at 11,885.79,
continuing its powerful rebound. The Nikkei rocketed 9.9% for the
week and is up 12.7% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The yen weakened after surging against the dollar Thursday. The
yen ended at 128.38 to the dollar, versus 127.05 Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Sun Microsystems Files Lawsuit Against Microsoft</HD>
<DH>Courts: Firm is accused of stifling the spread of Java and
extending its monopoly to server and other markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sun Microsystems Inc. opened a new front in the burgeoning legal war
on Microsoft Corp. on Friday by filing a private antitrust lawsuit
accusing the top software maker of illegally constraining the spread
of the Java programming language and violating a host of monopoly
laws.</LD>
<LD>   The Palo Alto-based maker of computer servers and workstations
filed the suit along with a request for a preliminary injunction in
San Jose federal court. Sun general counsel Mike Morris said
potential damages would reach more than $1billion before tripling, as
permitted under antitrust laws.</LD>
<LD>   The suit comes on the heels of a private antitrust suit filed by
AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Netscape unit in January. Both cases take
advantage of last year's ruling by a federal appeals court that found
Microsoft had used improper means to stifle Java and Netscape's Web
browser, which together could have threatened Microsoft's monopoly on
desktop computer operating systems.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft also faces a trial beginning March 18 in a suit by nine
states seeking restrictions on the company's behavior for its past
misdeeds, as well as a raft of class-action suits by purchasers of
its Windows operating systems.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the company believed there was
no legal or factual basis for the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Sun's case is the most sweeping suit to date against the
powerhouse from Redmond, Wash., but it is likely to take years to
resolve. The preliminary injunction request could be ruled on within
a year but will be harder to win.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the wide range of allegations, the Sun suit has at its
root some of the same facts as those in a narrower breach-of-contract
claim it filed against Microsoft more than four years ago. That suit
said Microsoft violated the terms of a license agreement to support
Java, a programming language developed by Sun.</TE>
<TE>   The judge who heard the earlier case determined that Microsoft
appeared to have broken its word to Sun and misled the software
industry into thinking that programs they wrote for Microsoft's
variant of Java also would run on other operating systems.
Microsoft's plan, according to e-mails from top executives, was to
"pollute" Java to confuse and divide the market.</TE>
<TE>   Sun settled that case by taking just $20 million but kept its
right to sue again on antitrust grounds. It said the new case was
more powerful because it placed Microsoft's behavior in the context
of its efforts to monopolize not just the PC market but the markets
for server operating systems, Web browsers and office productivity
suites.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft sees these things as a whole, and it's important for
the court to view that as well," Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   The chief target of the case is Microsoft's .Net framework for Web
services, which will function like Java but tie still more Internet
functions to Microsoft-based servers. That could hurt Sun's hardware
sales, Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   "What they've tried to do is buy time for themselves to catch up
to the Java platform," he said. "The degree to which Microsoft's
anti-competitive behavior has damaged the Java platform concerns us."</TE>
<TE>   Sun asked the court to force Microsoft to resume shipping Sun's
version of Java in its operating systems and to disclose the secret
protocols by which .Net communicates with Windows servers so that Sun
and others can compete.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, the case sets out a clear view of how the world
looks to Microsoft foes. But a federal judge may be reluctant to
revisit the Java fight, let alone use it as a springboard to reshape
Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless Microsoft did something else new and egregious, which I
don't think is the case here, Sun is going to have a tough time
getting the kind of sweeping remedies it wants," said analyst Rob
Enderle of Giga Information Group.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Sun, which on Friday reaffirmed sales projections for
the quarter, rose $1.17 to $10 on Nasdaq. Microsoft, which had a good
day in Washington federal court, rose $1.23 to $63.95, also on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Kollar-Kotelly Delays Trial, Questions Broadening Scope</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER   and JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The federal judge overseeing the Microsoft Corp. antitrust case
expressed misgivings Friday over a bid by nine states to expand the
scope of the trial to include restrictions on the software giant's
expansion into new markets, such as cell phones and television
set-top boxes.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said the states'
expanded filings raised a legal "red flag."</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think you can go back and prove additional illegal
behavior," Kollar-Kotelly said. "I don't know whether that's what
you're trying to do, but that's what it sounded like."</LD>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly delayed a hearing on the states' claims that was
scheduled to begin Monday. She set a new hearing date of March 18,
telling both sides to submit more information about the issues.</TE>
<TE>   Under a ruling from a federal appeals court, Kollar-Kotelly is
charged with crafting a resolution that prevents Microsoft from
continuing to use its power to squelch threats to its
operating-system monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   The states are arguing that some emerging areas constitute
potential threats and therefore deserve protection. Microsoft wants
to keep the focus more narrow, concentrating on programs that appear
on PCs today.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Kuney, an attorney for the states, said companies in the
emerging markets "are today in Microsoft's sights." The states and
the District of Columbia want Microsoft punished far more harshly
than the proposed antitrust settlement between the company and the
Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft attorney John Warden countered that any testimony about
devices other than PCs should be excluded from the trial because they
were not part of the original case, nor were they included in an
appeals court decision last year.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court found that Microsoft illegally acted to protect
its monopoly in a dozen ways, trying to kill off potential threats,
including Netscape's Web browser and the Java programming language.</TE>
<TE>   After listening to both sides, Kollar-Kotelly appeared to side
with Microsoft, telling the states' attorney, "I have some concerns
about your argument ... I frankly think you don't have enough case
law."</TE>
<TE>   Rob Enderle, a technology analyst with Giga Information Group,
said that if Microsoft succeeds in keeping the trial focused on PCs
alone, "they have won the battle, though they have not yet won the
war."</TE>
<TE>   "This shows the judge wants to keep this very closely contained
within the appellate court decision," he said. "The states want to
broaden the underlying case, and they can't do that."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft attorneys were pleased that Kollar-Kotelly challenged
the states' stance, but they did not declare a clear victory. They
noted the judge gave the states one more chance to make a legal
argument on why some of the non-PC issues should be included.</TE>
<TE>   The delay gives the judge time to rule on whether the proposed
settlement between the Justice Department and Microsoft is in the
public interest and appropriate for the misdeeds found last year by
the appeals court.</TE>
<TE>   Both Microsoft and Justice Department attorneys met in
Kollar-Kotelly's courtroom Wednesday to argue for the judge's
approval of their settlement.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the judge has not indicated when she would rule on the
settlement's fairness.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Lande, an antitrust law professor at the University of
Baltimore, said delaying the states' trial by a week gave a slight
advantage to Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   If Kollar-Kotelly issues a ruling on the Justice Department
settlement before the states' trial starts, it will make it "twice as
hard for the states to win," Lande said.</TE>
<TE>   The states want, among other things, to force Microsoft to create
a version of the Windows operating system that is "modular," so that
computer manufacturers can easily swap out features.</TE>
<TE>   But as the days pass and the states begin to present their case,
"she's going to learn more and more," Lande said. "It's less and less
likely she'll approve the federal consent order."</TE>

<HD>Danish Firm to Buy Wackenhut of U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Danish security and rescue company Group 4 Falck said it would buy
Wackenhut Corp., the largest security company in the U.S., for $573
million in cash to tap a growing market in the wake of the Sept. 11
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   With the deal, Falck's first entry into the $14-billion U.S.
security market, the company would challenge its Nordic rival
Securitas' leading market position and could follow with more
acquisitions.</LD>
<LD>   Falck posted sales of $2.5billion in 2001, compared with
Securitas' $5.9 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Securitas holds slightly less than 20% of the U.S. guarding
market, after acquisitions of rival companies Pinkerton and Burns.
Falck said Wackenhut is the second- largest provider of security
services in the U.S., its sales of $1.1 billion corresponding to a
market share of 7% to 8%.</TE>
<TE>   Falck, the world's second- biggest security firm, would pay $33 a
share for Wackenhut, equal to a 14% premium to the combined Wackenhut
A and B shares.</TE>
<TE>   Wackenhut stock slipped 59 cents to $33.81 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The shares have more than doubled since their Sept. 10
closing price of $16.70.</TE>

<LD>XO Communications Inc., a local phone company that has seen its value
decline to $40 million from $20 billion, is the object of a tussle
between investors Carl C. Icahn and Theodore J. Forstmann.</LD>
<LD>   Icahn said he and two other investors, whom he declined to
identify, owned more than one-quarter of XO debt and were opposed to
a plan put forward by Forstmann to replace those bonds with stock and
cash. XO said in November that Forstmann's buyout firm and Telefonos
de Mexico would invest $800million to eliminate $4billion of bonds
and wipe out equity, to avoid an involuntary bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Reston, Va.-based XO rose 3 cents to 9.5 cents in
over-the-counter trading.</LD>

<HD>GE Releases a More Detailed Annual Report</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL LAYNE</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>FAIRFIELD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>General Electric Co., responding to concern that its accounting lacks
transparency, released a more detailed annual report, including
additional specifics about the GE Capital finance unit.</LD>
<LD>   GE, the world's largest company by market value, listed sales and
operating profit from 26 of its main industrial and finance
businesses, compared with a dozen last year. The company also
highlighted information on its special purpose entities, often used
to package credit-card loans and other receivables that are sold to
investors.</LD>
<LD>   Some investors have been critical of the limited details that were
provided on the businesses that make up GE Capital, which accounts
for 40% of the company's profit.</LD>
<TE>   GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt pledged to provide more
information as investors began to question the accounting practices
of many companies after the collapse of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Fairfield.-based General Electric, a component of the
Dow Jones industrial average, fell 33 cents to $40.62 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The company gave details of restrictions on the entities and why
it uses them. None are allowed to hold General Electric stock. Some
of Enron's special entities were capitalized with the company's
stock. That helped to speed Enron's demise when the shares plunged as
losses masked by the entities were disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "Great companies are built on the foundation of accurate financial
information and compliance with the law," Immelt wrote in the
introduction to the financial section.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts who signed confidentiality agreements were briefed
on the financial information ahead of time, said spokesman David
Frail. The pacts prohibited them from acting on the information.</TE>
<TE>   GE also said it would take a first-quarter write-down of about $1
billion to comply with a new accounting rule that changes the way it
must account for goodwill from acquisitions. GE said it completed or
announced almost $23 billion in acquisitions in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   General Electric had $43 billion in off-balance-sheet assets in
special purpose entities at the end of last year. That's 39% more
than the $31 billion in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Drugstores Seek to Halt New Medicare Card Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CVS Corp., Walgreen Co., other drugstores and pharmacists asked a
federal judge to halt a new proposal by the Bush administration that
would give Medicare beneficiaries discounts on prescription
medicines.</LD>
<LD>   The drugstore chains and pharmacists blocked an earlier proposal
to give drug discount cards to Medicare patients, saying it would
benefit Express Scripts Inc., AdvancePCS Inc. and other companies
that would manage the program. That first plan would have forced
pharmacies to give discounts, the chains said.</LD>
<LD>   The administration withdrew the earlier plan and published a
revised drug card proposal for Medicare, the U.S. health insurance
program for the elderly and disabled. Drugstores and pharmacists said
the new proposal violated the judge's order blocking the plan.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman in a September ruling said
the drug card program was not authorized by a federal law that
Justice Department lawyers said allowed the government to provide
information and assistance to Medicare recipients.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new plan, published in the Federal Register this week,
Medicare beneficiaries would pay a one-time enrollment fee of no more
than $25 to join one of several card programs offered by companies
with at least five years of experience in managing pharmacy benefits.
Drug makers would be required to give discounts, which would probably
be passed along to pharmacies that fill the prescriptions.</TE>

<LD>A nationwide rent-to-own company will pay $47 million to more than

deal with women who alleged they were fired because of their gender

<LD>   Rent-A-Center also must create a human resources department and

<DL></DL>
<LD>Serono won Food and Drug Administration approval for the multiple
sclerosis drug Rebif, threatening sales of Biogen Inc.'s Avonex.
Biogen shares fell as much as 13%, and Serono's rose 13%.</LD>
<LD>   Europe's biggest biotechnology company plans to introduce Rebif in
the U.S. within days, Chief Financial Officer Jacques Theurillat
said. The medication, approved in more than 70 countries, had sales
of $110.5 million in the fourth quarter, about a third of Serono's
revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Geneva-based Serono gained entry to the $1.1-billion MS market
with a study that showed Rebif can prevent relapses better than
Avonex. A U.S. program that encourages research on rare diseases had
protected Avonex sales until May 2003 by barring approval of any
rival drug not proved safer or more effective.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Cambridge, Mass.-based Biogen fell $4.75 to $51.65 on
Nasdaq. Accredo Health Inc., which distributes Avonex, fell $4.57 to
$48.93 a share, also on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Rebif also will take on Betaferon from Schering and Chiron Corp.
and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.'s Copaxone.</TE>

<LD>If Jorge Fabregas played in the NBA, he would be guaranteed $778,000
this season. If he played in the NFL, he would be guaranteed
$650,000.</LD>
<LD>   Those sports have salary caps, but they also have minimum salaries
for veterans, along a scale based on years of experience. In
baseball, Fabregas' seven years of service guarantee him nothing
beyond the same minimum wage that applies to rookies. The Angels
signed their backup catcher for $500,000, plus incentives.</LD>
<LD>   With increasing numbers of veterans subject to pay cuts and minor
league contracts, and with the collective bargaining agreement up for
negotiation, will the players' union push for an agreement to raise
minimum salaries for veterans?</LD>

market ought to determine that.</TE>
<TE>   "For example, if you said you're going to have a veteran minimum
at $600,000--I'm making up a number, it's not a proposal--and the
major league minimum is $200,000, and the [veteran] guy isn't any
more valuable than the other player, then you're depriving him of the
opportunity to take a job at $200,000. That seems to us to be a
difficult thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Neither the NFL nor NBA mandates that veterans fill a specified
number of roster spots. But, so that teams do not keep a rookie
rather than a veteran strictly for cost savings, both leagues
subsidize the salaries of players with at least four years of service
who are making the veteran minimum, which tops out at $1 million in
the NBA and $750,000 in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   While a similar agreement might increase salaries for dozens of
major league veterans, players say they might have to accept a salary
cap in exchange, a concept they despise.</TE>
<TE>   "This might hurt a couple guys, but for the most part our system
gives you the opportunity to make more money," Fabregas said. "It's
an open system. You go out on the free-agent market and see what
you're worth."</TE>

<TE>   Outfielder Tim Salmon, who unsuccessfully tried to play through
shoulder and neck injuries last season, said he has asked Manager
Mike Scioscia and batting coach Mickey Hatcher to be more forceful in
determining when he might be too hurt to play.</TE>
<TE>   So, when Salmon reported stiffness in his lower back Friday,
Scioscia suggested he play it safe and take the day off. The two
compromised--Salmon grounded out in the first inning, then left the
game--and Salmon said he planned to play today.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to," he said. "I've got family coming to the game."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon says he feels healthy and strong this spring. He is hitting
.333 in 15 at-bats, with six runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm basically using both hands to swing instead of one arm,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels split Friday, beating the San Diego Padres, 8-6, at
Peoria and losing to the Colorado Rockies, 14-1, at Tucson. In the
victory, Troy Glaus hit his first home run of the spring, and Troy
Percival struck out the side in his one inning.... The Angels will
send Nathan Haynes to Southern California to consult with Dr. Norman
Zemel, a hand specialist, about the thumb injury Haynes suffered
Wednesday. If Zemel recommends surgery to repair the damaged
ligament, Scioscia said Haynes could miss "half the season." Haynes,
the only outfielder on Baseball America's list of the top 10 Angel
prospects, was scheduled to play center field at triple-A Salt Lake.</TE>

<HD>Umpires Involved in Betting</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major league umpires Frank Pulli and Richie Garcia were put on two
years' probation in 1989 after a secret investigation into gambling
on sports other than baseball.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Daily News said John Dowd, also the investigator in
the Pete Rose gambling probe, wrote the report that led to the
sanctions against the two umpires.</LD>
<LD>   Fay Vincent, who was deputy commissioner and later commissioner in
1989, said that Don Zimmer--then manager of the Chicago Cubs--also
was put on probation in 1989 for betting on sports other than
baseball. Zimmer discussed the sanction in a book published last
year.</LD>
<TE>   "These guys came in, they didn't deny it, it was no big deal,"
Vincent said. "That was it."</TE>
<TE>   Vincent said the case was minor is his opinion because there was
no evidence of betting on baseball. Rose, the manager of the
Cincinnati Reds, agreed to a lifetime ban that same year after an
investigation into his gambling.</TE>
<TE>   While there was no official finding, commissioner A. Bartlett
Giamatti said he had concluded that Rose, the career hits leader, had
bet on baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Pulli and Garcia did not respond to attempts to reach them by the
Daily News. Pulli did not return a telephone call Friday from The
Associated Press seeking comment and Garcia could not be contacted.</TE>
<TE>   Pulli is entering his third season as an umpire supervisor and
baseball is considering hiring Garcia as a supervisor.</TE>

<TE>   Cleveland bench coach Grady Little, optimistic about becoming
manager of the Boston Red Sox, got a boost when another candidate was
taken out of the running.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox were denied permission by Oakland to interview bench
coach Ken Macha, who managed four seasons in the Boston system,
Athletics General Manager Billy Beane said.</TE>
<TE>   Beane called it a "difficult personal decision" to deny Boston's
request because he knows Macha wants to be a manager. But he said it
was too close to the season's start to allow Macha to go.</TE>
<TE>   "Three weeks from the season, we have a club we think will be good
and Ken is an integral part of our staff," Beane said.</TE>
<TE>   With opening day only 24 days away, the A's already have lost J.P.
Ricciardi, who went to Toronto as general manager, and Grady Fuson,
who went to Texas as an aide to General Manager John Hart.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians already had allowed Little to talk with the Red Sox
and gave him an enthusiastic endorsement to succeed Joe Kerrigan, who
was fired Tuesday. Little was expected to be interviewed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   At least four candidates are expected to be interviewed, a process
beginning Friday and most likely to carry over to today, team owner
John Henry said.</TE>
<TE>   Interim manager Mike Cubbage, Boston's third base coach, said he
was told by interim general manager Mike Port that he would be
considered for the permanent job.</TE>

<TE>   New York Yankee left-hander Andy Pettitte skipped his exhibition
start against Pittsburgh after feeling tightness in his elbow while
warming up.... Corey Koskie went back to Minnesota to be examined by
a hand specialist where it was determined he has a deep bruise and
will need 10 to 14 days to rehabilitate.... The San Diego Padres
purchased the contract of right-handed pitcher Steve Reed.</TE>

<HD>Arizona Likes Where It Is Now</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Wildcats complete sweep of California,
90-78, and will face Trojans today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yes, the Pacific 10 tournament is back.</LD>
<LD>   So is Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   Lute Olson never liked the tournament, but he has always owned it.</LD>
<TE>   Before this one began, he called it "asinine" for the conference's
teams to beat up on each other any more.</TE>
<TE>   Now if USC doesn't end Arizona's run in the title game today, the
Pac-10 will have to call Olson champion.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats advanced to the final with a 90-78 victory over
California on Friday night at Staples Center, completing a three-game
season sweep of the Bears--though somewhat less convincingly than
last week's 46-point victory in Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   It can be a delicate thing to be philosophically opposed to
something and still excel at it--just ask Stanford--but Olson has
mastered it.</TE>
<TE>   His record in Pac-10 tournaments is 11-1, and Arizona (21-9) has
won three of the previous four, in 1988, '89 and '90--losing only in
a 1987 quarterfinal game to Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in Arizona's way today is a Trojan team the Wildcats
split with this season, winning, 97-80, in Tucson, and losing, 94-89,
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The winner will earn the conference's automatic NCAA bid. (A
record six Pac-10 teams are expected to make the NCAA field: Arizona,
USC, Oregon, Cal, UCLA and Stanford.)</TE>
<TE>   "As everyone knows, USC is playing great basketball," forward Luke
Walton said after a 20-point, six-assist performance that helped hold
off a Cal rally at the end.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Jason Gardner, who scored 25, put it stronger.</TE>
<TE>   "They're playing better than anybody in the country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Olson is concerned about one statistic.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a very bad rebounding team and 'SC is rebounding as well
as anyone. That has to be our No. 1 concern.</TE>
<TE>   "We had 16 defensive rebounds and Cal had 15 offensive rebounds.
Those are bad numbers."</TE>
<TE>   The semifinal between Arizona and Cal (22-8) came only six days
after the Bears' disaster in the desert--a staggering 99-53 loss.</TE>
<TE>   As Cal Coach Ben Braun noted, it wasn't as if his players could
have forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   In that game, Arizona led by 19 at halftime, then went on a 30-4
run to open the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's game felt nothing like that.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona once led by 15, but with 31/2 minutes left, suddenly it
was down to six.</TE>
<TE>   Cal's 6-5 Joe Shipp got an offensive rebound under the basket and
scored to make it 77-71.</TE>
<TE>   But Walton answered--as he did so often down the stretch--banking
in a shot on the other end.</TE>
<TE>   Shipp missed a free throw that could have made the lead six again,
and Arizona freshman Will Bynum sank a baseline jumper with 2:44 left
to make it nine again.</TE>
<TE>   When Shipp was called for on an offensive foul with 2:26 left,
Arizona finally seemed in control.</TE>
<TE>   Cal, which held teams to 41% shooting, allowed Arizona to shoot
58%.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Brian Wethers led the Bears in the first half, scoring 17 of
his 22 points by halftime. Shipp finished with 25.</TE>
<TE>   Olson's objections to the conference tournament are about
additional missed class time and the lack of necessity for having a
tournament--even the possibility it will tire the Pac-10's teams
excessively going into the NCAA tournament after already playing an
18-game conference schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his objections, he wins.</TE>
<TE>   "We treat it like a game. Every game we play, we try to win," he
said. "Guys have a lot of pride in wearing the Arizona jersey."</TE>
<TE>   His group of freshmen is also a lot wiser than when they started
the Pac-10 season being swept by Oregon, and Walton is a far more
brilliant player than anyone knew then.</TE>
<TE>   Believe it or not, even Olson seems to have softened on the
tournament, if only a tad.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of good things have happened," Olson said. "This is
being handled like a first-class affair. I think the difference--then
and now--is the organization that has gone behind this. It's very
different from what it was, frankly."</TE>
<TE>   Not in one way, however: Arizona, once again, has a chance to end
up the champion.</TE>

<HD>Olowokandi Is Right in Middle of Victory</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Clipper center scores career-high 30 points
and takes 16 rebounds in win over Bulls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The Clippers found a weakness Friday and exploited it again and
again, which in itself might rate as front-page news. After all, they
haven't always been adept at taking advantage of their rare
opportunities for superiority this season.</LD>
<LD>   All too often, they get away from what has been good for them and
pay the price in the end. But it never happened against the Chicago
Bulls. And maybe that was so simply because their opponents were the
Chicago Bulls.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the reason, oft-maligned center Michael Olowokandi went
for a career-high 30 points, took 16 rebounds and led the Clippers to
a 94-90 victory before a crowd of 20,359 at the United Center.</LD>
<TE>   It was the Clippers' fourth victory in their last five games and
enabled them to gain a game in the Western Conference playoff race.
It also enabled them to match their 2000-01 total of 31 victories in
only their 62nd game.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi still suffers the slings and slights of a nationwide
hoop audience that can't fathom the notion of a former No. 1 overall
draft pick averaging a meager 9.4 points to go with a credible 8.8
rebounds after almost four full NBA seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, he looked like an emerging standout in the low post,
hitting a variety of short jump shots and hooks over the bewildered
Bulls. Of course, it always helps when the man guarding you is still
a boy.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi took full advantage of Eddy Curry, Chicago's
19-year-old center who is less than a year removed from his
graduation from Thornwood (Ill.) High School. In the final analysis,
though, perhaps a seasoned veteran might also have struggled to
contain Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   He was that good Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The Beast," point guard Jeff McInnis said after the game of
Olowokandi, who made 13 of 23 shots and four of six free throws.
"That's my new nickname for him."</TE>
<TE>   "The Beast" overshadowed the returns to Chicago of Elton Brand, a
former Bull, and Quentin Richardson, a former player at DePaul and
Whitney Young High. Brand had another steady game with 15 points and
10 rebounds. Richardson added 16 points and sank four key free throws
with the Clippers clinging to a small lead in the final seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi also made it possible for the Clippers to overcome a
Chicago team that probably deserved a better fate. At least that was
Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry's opinion after his team moved within 31/2
games of a playoff spot in the Western Conference standings.</TE>
<TE>   "They're in every single game and they play extremely hard," he
said of the Bulls. "They're a lot like we are. They can't get a play
to go their way sometimes down the stretch. But when Michael plays
like that we're a really good team."</TE>
<TE>   With his team sputtering offensively to start the game, Olowokandi
began to beat Curry and his backup, Dalibor Bagaric, down the floor.
McInnis passed him the ball and Olowokandi dunked it. By halftime,
the Clippers trailed, 44-42, and Olowokandi had 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' largest lead was eight points and the Bulls' was
six. The teams were tied 19 times. The difference was that the
Clippers kept going to Olowokandi and Gentry kept him on the floor
for 43 minutes. He averages 30.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the smartest coach in the world, but I will tell you that
a guy going like that is going to play a lot of minutes," Gentry
said. "And Elton, every night he's going to give you between 14 and
20 points and 10 and 15 rebounds. Those two guys, when they play that
kind of game, we're pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   And, still, it took sound free-throw shooting down the stretch for
the Clippers to hold off the last-place Bulls (16-46). Olowokandi and
Richardson each made one of two, giving the Clippers an 85-82 lead
with 1:28 left.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago would cut its deficit to 90-87 after Jalen Rose's driving
basket. But Richardson went four for four in the final 22.2 seconds,
countering Rose's three-pointer at the other end. Rose and Trenton
Hassell had 21 points apiece for the Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   Later, with their victory secure, the Clippers did not claim it
was a thing of beauty.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed this win to get back to .500 and start chasing those
teams ahead of us," said McInnis, who had 17 points and eight
assists.</TE>
<TE>   Added Brand: "It feels good that I didn't have the great game and
we still won. It was a great homecoming for the Chicagoland guys."</TE>

<HD>Ishii Impresses in First Outing</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>It wasn't prime time and the show is only starting, but Kazuhisa
Ishii showed Friday why the early reviews have been sensational,
earning a victory in his first exhibition start, 5-1, against the
Atlanta Braves at Dodgertown.</LD>
<LD>   The touted Japanese left-hander, whom the Dodgers believe will be
as good as advertised, met expectations in his first test against
another team, baffling the Braves in two innings before a sellout
crowd of 5,357 at Holman Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Working with backup catcher Chad Kreuter, Ishii mixed sharp
fastballs, sliders and forkballs while striking out four without a
walk. Julio Franco had the lone hit against him, a two-out single to
left in the first.</LD>
<TE>   The former star of the Yakult Swallows threw seven consecutive
strikes to open the game, freezing several batters with his
late-breaking slider, had 21 strikes in 30 pitches and great movement
on a fastball clocked at 94 mph. Ishii is scheduled to pitch Tuesday
against Montreal at Dodgertown.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little nervous," Ishii said through an interpreter. "But
more than being nervous, I was more excited, pitching in the United
States on American field, for the first time, in a game that actually
counted."</TE>
<TE>   Grapefruit League games don't matter to the Dodgers; Ishii's
performance does.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything you heard, that's what you saw," said Dave Wallace,
senior vice president. "It's one game, it's only two innings and it's
spring training, but the presence, the confidence and those things
you look for ... those are nice attributes."</TE>
<TE>   Said pitching coach Jim Colborn: "He made them [the Braves] look
silly."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii's new teammates admired his composure in the face of intense
scrutiny Japanese players face daily from a throng of Japanese
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have some type of focus before you even step on that
mound, and he clearly showed that," Kreuter said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are also happy about rookie Cesar Izturis, soon to be
selected the opening-day shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   Izturis went three for four Friday--raising his batting average to
.364--with a solo home run, two runs batted in, two runs and a heady
defensive play. Playing second in the fourth, he backhanded B.J.
Surhoff's grounder close to the bag and flipped it to shortstop Alex
Cora, whose throw beat Surhoff to first.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are so enamored of Izturis that they declined an
opportunity to sign free-agent infielder Rey Sanchez, who is expected
to sign with the Boston Red Sox. General Manager Dan Evans considered
trading for Sanchez last season when the club was disappointed in
Cora, now competing to make the 25-man roster as a backup. Cora is
out of options, but executives with other teams said he might clear
waivers, enabling the Dodgers to send him to triple-A Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "We like Rey Sanchez, we think he is a good player, and he was an
option we explored last season," Evans said. "But we thought, for
both the short- and long-term progress of Izturis' career, it would
benefit the organization and Izturis not to bring in Rey."</TE>

<TE>   Shawn Green, slowed because of tendinitis in his left (throwing)
shoulder, played right field for the first time, going hitless in two
at-bats.</TE>

<HD>A Rare Trade Win Is Enjoyed by the Ducks</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Friesen and Shields, acquired for Selanne last
year, shine in 2-1 victory over the Devils.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some nights the best-laid plans work.</LD>
<LD>   Just over a year has passed since the March 5 trade when the
Mighty Ducks shipped the popular Teemu Selanne to San Jose. The deal
never looked better than in a 2-1 victory over the New Jersey Devils
in front of an announced 15,051 at the Arrowhead Pond on Friday
night.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks received a return on the players they got for Selanne.
Jeff Friesen had a goal and an assist, skating for only the second
game with Paul Kariya and Steve Rucchin. Goalie Steve Shields did
everything but put a condemned sign on the net.</LD>
<TE>   OK, so the deal hasn't taken to the Ducks to the promised land,
merely helped get them out of the cellar in the Western
Conference--and into 14th place. Friesen has struggled at times.
Shields has played well, but is a backup to Jean-Sebastien Giguere.</TE>
<TE>   None of that mattered Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Shields was brilliant. He kept the Ducks from collapsing in the
first period, stopping all Devil 19 shots. Shields, who has been
dangled as trade bait, stopped 44 of 45 shots in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Friesen, Kariya and Rucchin seem a nice fit, especially with
Rucchin out of the emergency room and back on the ice. They combined
for two goals, one that broke a 1-1 tie 2 minutes 17 seconds into the
third period.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that was going to be the group the whole year,"
Friesen said. "For whatever reason, there were a lot different
experiments since Day 1 of training camp. That's the way it goes."</TE>
<TE>   The threesome was united for the first time Wednesday against
Atlanta and produced two goals, both by Kariya. They had two more
Friday, giving the Ducks their ninth victory in the last 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a veteran group," Duck Coach Bryan Murray said. "Friesen
gives us speed. Kariya gives us skill and speed and scoring. Rucchin
gives us a big body that plays the game real honest."</TE>
<TE>   That was illustrated on a power play early in the third period.
Friesen raced into the Devil zone and fed Rucchin, who muscled a
defender, spun and slipped a pass to Kariya by the side of the net.
Kariya hammered home a one-timer to give the Ducks a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully we'll play well, score some goals, have some fun,"
Friesen said.</TE>
<TE>   The trio skated together on the first day of training camp but
were split up the next day, as Murray had to mix and match his lines,
trying to squeeze what he could from an offense-challenged bunch.</TE>
<TE>   Then Rucchin, who missed 66 games due to injuries last season,
missed 44 after suffering a broken ankle. He returned Feb. 27.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that Steve Rucchin over his career has gotten the
recognition he should have because he played with Kariya and
Selanne," Murray said. "Everyone gave them all the marks for being
the talent and he was the plugger. He's more than that."</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin proved that in the first period, taking a pass at the blue
line from Jason York and splitting two Devil players. Rucchin passed
to a wide-open Friesen, who gave the Ducks a 1-0 lead 16:40 into the
first period.</TE>
<TE>   Shields kept the Ducks from being skated out of the arena in the
first period.</TE>
<TE>   The Devils had one golden chance after another, but Shields kept
all out of the net.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Holik had five quality shots in the period, including two in
a flurry where Shields stopped three point-blank shots in a matter of
seconds. Shields stoned Jason Arnott on a breakaway in the second
period.</TE>
<TE>   Holik fired a cross-ice pass to Scott Niedermayer, who lined up a
shot that beat Shields into the upper left of the net to tie the
score, 1-1, 12:15 into the second period.</TE>

<LD>Mighty Duck center Marc Chouinard, who injured his left shoulder
against Minnesota on Feb. 27, suffered a torn muscle and nerve
damage, and there is no timetable for his return.</LD>
<LD>   Chouinard injured his shoulder in a collision with Minnesota's
Matt Johnson. Team officials initially said Chouinard had a strained
shoulder, but downgraded his condition this week.</LD>
<LD>   "The nerves are the thing the doctors are worried about,"
Chouinard said. "They don't know how much time it's going to take
really. It hasn't improved in the last week. So at least one week
more, maybe two."</LD>
<TE>   Coach Bryan Murray wasn't so optimistic, saying Chouinard
shouldn't rush back.</TE>

<DH>Dodgers Believe Rookie Izturis  Has What It Takes  to
Handle Pressure</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Every big league regular has gone through what Cesar Izturis probably
will go through if he wins the Dodger shortstop job, a rookie season
filled with emotional highs and lows, anxiety and doubt and that
never-ending question: Do I belong?</LD>
<LD>   But if there is one Dodger who probably can relate most to such an
experience, it is third-base coach Glenn Hoffman, who was 21 when he
replaced Butch Hobson as third baseman for the Boston Red Sox in 1980
and played his first big league season in Fenway Park's pressure
cooker.</LD>
<LD>   Head spinning, he went hitless in his first 15 at-bats, and
veteran first baseman Tony Perez stepped in. After Hoffman's fourth
hitless game, Perez took the kid out to dinner, bought him a few
drinks, told him to have fun, relax, stay loose.</LD>
<TE>   The next day, Hoffman went four for four, a triple, two doubles
and a single against Kansas City's Paul Splittorff. That was the
beginning of a decent rookie season for Hoffman, who hit .285 with
four home runs and 42 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never forget that," Hoffman said of his dinner with Perez.
"It was a veteran guy showing confidence in you. He made me feel like
I was part of the team."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, that's all it takes. When Dodger first baseman Eric
Karros was a rookie in 1992, veterans Roger McDowell, Brett Butler
and Kevin Gross went out of their way to include him in team
activities, taking him out to dinner on the road, talking about their
big league experiences in the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "At that stage, that comfort can translate to comfort on the
field," Karros said. "Young guys question whether they belong, and if
you include them in on-field and off-field activities, they feel part
of the group."</TE>
<TE>   Many have questioned the wisdom of a big-market team with a
payroll in excess of $100 million, a team that considers itself a
playoff contender, starting a 22-year-old kid with a mere 46 games of
big league experience at shortstop, the most demanding defensive
position on the field next to catcher.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers believe Izturis, acquired in a winter trade with
Toronto, has the physical skills to handle it--he is quick and
athletic and has shown soft, sure hands and a strong arm in spring
drills and exhibition games, and Dodger scouts rave about his
instincts.</TE>
<TE>   The speedy Izturis, considered a good bet to beat out incumbent
Alex Cora this spring, hit .269 for the Blue Jays last season and is
hitting .364 in the spring. He has the potential to steal 40 bases.</TE>
<TE>   The two biggest questions: Can he handle the pressure of the big
leagues? Can he handle the rigors, both physical and emotional, of a
162-game big league season?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of him letting us know when he's ready," Manager
Jim Tracy said. "You put him in situations and observe how he handles
them. You let him tell you how much he's ready to take on. That's the
approach we'll take. We'll give him opportunities and see how he
responds."</TE>
<TE>   Izturis, who has played winter ball in his native Venezuela the
last four years, responded well to his first dose of the big leagues.
Called up to replace the injured Homer Bush in 2001, Izturis made his
major league debut in Fenway Park on June 23.</TE>
<TE>   The first Red Sox batter of the game, Jose Offerman, hit a
grounder to Izturis, who fielded it cleanly and threw out Offerman at
first. He also got a hit off Frank Castillo in his first major league
at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so excited I couldn't even sleep the night before," Izturis
said. "Being in Fenway Park with that crowd, it was a great
experience, and that should help me."</TE>
<TE>   But what if that first grounder had rolled through his legs?</TE>
<TE>   "That would have rattled me," Izturis admits.</TE>
<TE>   How rookies respond to such adversity is the best indication of
whether they can play in the big leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to have good days and bad days, and the veteran
players can help you get through the bad days," Hoffman said. "I
tried to be too perfect when I first came up. You can't. The
intensity of playing in the major leagues every day ... you can't
match that."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman, like most rookies, experienced growing pains.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest thing when I went to the major leagues was facing
five starting pitchers who were good," Hoffman said. "In the minor
leagues, you'd face one or two good starting pitchers [per team]. And
the quality of the guys coming out of the [big league] bullpen was
better.</TE>
<TE>   "Defensively, the game is faster, the ball is hit harder, the
players run faster and make better plays against you. There's a
concentration level you have to have on every pitch. There's no
relaxation. Actually, there is, but that's what you have to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Rookies must learn how to control their nerves.</TE>
<TE>   "Mistakes come when you get into situations where ... it's not
that you panic, but you begin to react real quick," Karros said. "You
have to slow the game down. If your mind is racing all the time and
you're reacting to everything, you're always going to be a step
behind."</TE>
<TE>   Izturis is more mature than many 22-year-olds. He's married and
has a 2-year-old son, has played with numerous big leaguers in
Venezuela and in two Caribbean World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Izturis fared pretty well in his first taste of the big leagues,
committing only three errors in 197 chances for Toronto during his
three-week stint as a starter last June and July and in a reserve
role as a September call-up.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to press or get caught up in trying to impress
everybody, I just want to play my game," Izturis said. "My whole
career, I've played good defense, and in winter ball I concentrated
on offense, improving my on-base percentage, being selective at the
plate. The best way to open some eyes is to relax and control
yourself."</TE>

<HD>Taylor Continues Search for Forward</HD>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Dave Taylor returned home empty-handed from this week's general
managers' meetings in Naples, Fla., but the Kings' pursuit of a
high-scoring forward has not been abandoned.</LD>
<LD>   It's just that, with the playoff races in each conference so
tightly packed, few teams are willing to make major moves just yet,
even with the March 19 trade deadline rapidly approaching, Taylor
said.</LD>
<LD>   "Not a lot of players available," he said. "There's still 10 days.
I think we have to remain patient and see how it goes."</LD>
<TE>   Taylor has said for months that he would like to move a
goaltender, former starter Stephane Fiset probably being his first
choice over Jamie Storr, but his No. 1 objective is landing a
top-flight forward.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't view it as a hole, particularly," he said, "but it's an
area where we could strengthen ourselves and give ourselves a little
more balance. You could also use help in different areas, but our
primary need would be a scorer."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Guerin of the Boston Bruins, Tony Amonte of the Chicago
Blackhawks and Bobby Holik of the New Jersey Devils, all eligible to
become free agents after the season, have been mentioned as
possibilities. But even if those players were made available, the
Kings obviously wouldn't be the only team interested.</TE>
<TE>   So, Taylor sits and waits. Failing to make a trade, he said,
"wouldn't be the end of the world for us. The team's been playing
well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Steve Heinze having been benched Thursday night, Kelly
Buchberger and Ian Laperriere are the only Kings who have played in
all 64 games. Coach Andy Murray said he would decide this morning if
Heinze will play today against the Colorado Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to get him back in there right away," Murray said, "but
we played a pretty solid game in Nashville."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On his second day back at work after his auto accident last month
in Wisconsin, Murray planned to venture out into 20-degree
temperatures Friday night to watch a college hockey game. "I'd go
crazy if I was sitting here too much," he said.</TE>

<LD>The top personnel at the Los Angeles Marathon say a change in course
will bring in faster times and more elite runners. This may help a
little, but being a middle-of-the-pack marathoner, the real answer,
Mr. Burke, is to please, please, please change the start time to an
earlier hour!</LD>
<LD>   The weather for Sunday's race was ridiculously hot. It may not be
a good business decision, but an earlier start will result in faster
times.</LD>

<TE>   As a runner and finisher of the first 14 Los Angeles Marathons and
as a volunteer in the last two, I always taped the race so that I
could see it when I got home. For 16 years, Channel 13 did a very
good job in televising the race so that it included all 20,000
runners as well as the elite runners. I was concerned when I found
out that Channel 9 was taking over the coverage of the marathon, and
was more concerned when I heard that they were only doing three hours
of coverage. Leaving the air at 11:30 a.m. will leave most of the
runners still fighting their way down the course.</TE>
<TE>   When I watched this year's coverage of the race on Sunday night, I
was really disappointed. Not only did they not explain why the race
was delayed for 28 minutes, they also ignored most of the 22,000-plus
runners. After the start of the race, they never went back to "the
pack" to see how the warm temperature was affecting them.</TE>
<TE>   They also ignored all of the great entertainment centers along the
route and the cultural points of interest. In fact, they seemed to
ignore every aspect of the race except the leaders and their stories.</TE>
<TE>   Please, KCAL, look at the tapes of the previous L.A. marathons and
follow their example of how a marathon should be televised. Give back
the race to the people.</TE>

<LD>Wow, the greatest thing since the invention of frozen orange juice!
Yes I'm talking about John Madden joining Al Michaels on "Monday
Night Football." ABC finally gets it right. I stopped watching "MNF"
when Dennis Miller entered the booth. The only Miller I wanted came
in a can. I'll guarantee ABC that I and thousands of others will be
watching Michaels and Madden, even if it's a lousy game. This
combination will be as good as any, including Jim Nantz and Ken
Venturi.</LD>
<LD>   I know I'm right when I read T.J. Simers knock Madden when he
states, "Madden has a made a career of dumbing down football." Simers
is a guy who has equally made a career of dumbing down sports columns
weekly in The Times.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gosh, I can't wait to see what Steve Lavin does with next year's
team. I mean, look at the long list of great things he has done thus
far. He has taken a team picked by a landslide to win the Pac-10 and
he turned them into a sixth-place team that flamed out in the first
round of the conference tournament. He has taken a team that was
picked by most to be a top-five team in the country and he has them
right out of the top 25 and headed for a No. 8 seed in the NCAA
tournament. Yet another enthralling Sweet 16 (or Steve 16 as I like
to call it) can't be far behind.</LD>
<LD>   "Coach" Lavin has taken a team with four returning starters, three
seniors in the starting lineup, and what he called a monster
recruiting class, and he has turned them into a horribly sporadic
group that is the third-best team in Southern California behind USC
and Pepperdine.</LD>
<LD>   I can only imagine what he will do when he loses Gadzuric, Kapono,
Barnes and Knight. The excitement at Pauley next year will really be
something else, huh?</LD>

<TE>   Has there ever been a college basketball team that played with
less intelligence offensively and defensively than the current UCLA
squad?</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the season this team excelled at coming from ahead to
lose. Now that turnovers prevent them from ever gaining a lead,
they've lost even that distinction. The fact that UCLA basketball was
once coached by John Wooden, whose teams epitomized discipline and
intelligence, only serves to emphasize the point. And for those of
you who think we should get off Steve Lavin's back, are we not to
assume that he is the one in charge? Or is that too much of a
compliment?</TE>

<TE>   No timeout is called and there is no set play. Who gets the last
shot? The second-string (didn't play in the first half) point guard.</TE>
<TE>   Who's to blame for this vaudeville act? Lavin. Soon, the
once-mighty Bruins will be playing to an empty house. Give him the
hook!</TE>

<HD>Going Hog Wild Over Richardson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In response to J.A. Adande's column about Nolan Richardson [March 5]:
One of the strongest aspects of this country, this society, is its
diversity. Conversely, one of its weak points is the lack of
tolerance.</LD>
<LD>   As a remedy to this lack of tolerance, people feel that there must
be "sameness" in the solution to any problem. If a person has a
problem, then only a person of the same ethnicity can possibly
understand the situation. Doesn't that imply that anyone other is a
racist or a bigot and therefore couldn't possibly understand the
problem?</LD>
<LD>   The difficulty that I have with the column is how Adande stated
his opinion. Yes, he is entitled to his opinion and it is a necessary
one in order to have a dialogue, but why does it have to be an
African-American opinion? Does that make it more credible?</LD>
<TE>   He is an African American so he cannot, under his pretext, give
anything but an African American's opinion and that, in my view, is
not true. What's wrong with having the opinion of J.A. Adande?</TE>
<TE>   Robert W. Talarowski</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is interesting that while J.A. Adande and recently departed
Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson lament the lack of diversity in the
media, they also fail to acknowledge the lack of diversity on the
basketball court. The discrepancy that exists between the faces of
the participants on the court and that of the faces of the students
in the stands demonstrates that perhaps merit still rules in the
classroom as well as on the basketball court.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, it helps to have a degree in journalism if one wishes
to become a journalist. This would be quite difficult to accomplish
given the 0% graduation rate of Richardson's African-American players
at Arkansas. This is abominable considering that all of these players
supposedly received scholarships for the purpose of obtaining an
education. Of course, Richardson was not unlike many of today's
college coaches, who are only interested in exploiting the athletic
ability of their players for the self-expedient reasons of building a
winning record and making more money.</TE>
<TE>   One of the great things about our democratic society is that life
consists of choices. Nothing prevented Adande from becoming a
journalist. And perhaps, he will find more diversity in America's
newsrooms when he recognizes that academic success is enhanced more
by picking up a book instead of a basketball.</TE>

if said figure was infamous for spitting on children from the

racist for decades without much comment in the sports pages, but that

<LD>March Madness should be scrapped. What good is a tournament that
brings in a zillion dollars and determines a national champion?</LD>
<LD>   A better system would be half the nation's Division I teams
playing 75 one-game exhibitions at the largest arenas across the
country. Each game could be sponsored by a corporation and preceded
by a parade. They could be called "cups." Imagine the income drawn
from 150 universities partaking in one last game for the fun of it.
Texas Tech could play UCLA in the Enron Cup, for example.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the first 74 games played would be meaningless. A
computer can determine two teams to play one final game for the
"championship."</LD>
<TE>   Madness indeed.</TE>

<LD>I have read, with a bit of amazement, the recent plans for Fred
Couples to launch a tour for middle-aged, skill-losing PGA pros. Fred
needs to up his psychiatrist visits and listen to the good doctor
telling him he's in his 40s now, not his 20s.</LD>
<LD>   Face the music, Freddie. As Father Time works his way through your
anatomy, you lose the zip on your fastball, you lose a step in the
40, and you lose distance on the big dog. Freddie, baby, you are
getting older, so face the facts, quit crying and whining, and look
for a day job.</LD>

<HD>Jordan-Like Effort for McGrady</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 17,248 fans at T.D. Waterhouse Centre bought their tickets to
Friday night's game thinking they would see Michael Jordan. Although
he stayed home with a bad knee, the sellout crowd still witnessed a
Jordanesque performance.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy McGrady scored a career-high 50 points as the Orlando Magic
ended a four-game losing streak with a 99-96 win over the Washington
Wizards at Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   "It means a lot, especially when you get your career-high and you
win," said McGrady, whose previous best was 49 points. "It's a great
feeling."</LD>
<TE>   The last time an Orlando player topped 50 points was April 20,
1994, when Shaquille O'Neal scored a franchise-record 53 points
against Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   McGrady broke a 96-96 tie with an eight-foot leaner with 13
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "The best part was he just took it at full blast," Orlando Coach
Doc Rivers said. "He never broke stride, and his thought was, 'I have
to get to the basket and someone is going to have to make a great
play to stop me.' And that was great."</TE>
<TE>   After the Wizards' Tyronn Lue missed a potential game-tying shot,
McGrady reached 50 points with a free throw with 0.8 seconds left. He
had 15 points in the fourth quarter</TE>
<TE>   McGrady shot 18 for 29 from the field, including four for seven on
three-point attempts. He also had 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my boys before I left the house, 'I'm getting at least 40
tonight,'" McGrady said. "I came out strong, my shot was feeling
good, my legs were feeling fresh."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 99, Charlotte 87--Peja Stojakovic scored 13 of his 24
points in the fourth quarter and Chris Webber had 20 points to lead
the Kings at Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Vlade Divac had 17 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists before
getting ejected as the Kings finally broke open a close game with a
defensive stand in the fourth quarter. The Kings, the only team yet
to lose three consecutive this season, ended a two-game losing streak
for the fifth time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portland 82, New Jersey 73--Bonzi Wells scored 21 points and
Rasheed Wallace had 18 at Portland, Ore., as the Trail Blazers won
their 12th consecutive.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyon Martin scored 19 points, Kerry Kittles had 16 and Jason
Kidd had 10 points and seven assists for New Jersey, the Eastern
Conference leaders. But the Nets are 0-3 on a Western road trip that
ends today in Seattle, and they have dropped five out of six and 10
of 17.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 83, Miami 74--The Raptors, despite playing without Vince
Carter for much of the first half because of foul trouble, ended a
13-game losing streak with a victory at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto, winning for the first time since Feb. 7, ended Miami's
four-game winning streak. The Heat lost for only the second time in
eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Davis scored 23 points for the Raptors. Carter, who played
only six minutes in the first half after picking up three fouls,
scored 16 points in 27 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 109, Indiana 100--Allen Iverson broke the 40-point
barrier for the fourth time in five games, scoring 41 in the 76ers'
victory at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine O'Neal had 25 points, and Jonathan Bender had 17 for
Indiana, which has lost two consecutive since Reggie Miller returned
from a two-game suspension for a fight with Kobe Bryant. Miller had
15 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 117, Detroit 92--Paul Pierce scored 31 points and Antoine
Walker had 24, and both made three-pointers during a 16-3 run that
lifted the Celtics at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce, Walker, Walter McCarty and Rodney Rogers had
three-pointers, and Pierce and Walker also had layups during a spurt
that gave the Celtics a 78-60 lead in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 108, Houston 95--Jason Richardson returned from an
ankle injury to score 32 points as the Warriors won at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson, who sprained his left ankle March 1 and missed the
previous two games, showed few ill effects in his 36 minutes as the
Warriors ended a 13-game road losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 115, Milwaukee 109--Andre Miller scored 31 points and
played all 53 minutes as Cavaliers won in overtime at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Davis scored 21 points for Cleveland, including a jumper
with 26.6 seconds left in overtime to give the Cavaliers a 111-107
lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 81, Minnesota 76--Stephon Marbury scored 28 points and
Kevin Garnett of the Timberwolves managed only four as the Suns
rallied at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time in 15 games that Garnett has been held to
single digits after a streak of 338 double-digit contests. Garnett
had a season-high 18 rebounds, but only one in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 85, Utah 79--Latrell Sprewell had two steals and six of
his 19 points in the last 2:29 at Salt Lake City as the Knicks ended
a six-game road losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell made two free throws with 10.7 seconds to play, giving
New York an 83-79 lead.</TE>
<TE>   He then stole Bryon Russell's inbounds pass and made two more foul
shots to seal the victory, the Knicks' first over the Jazz in the
last nine meetings.</TE>

<HD>Dolphins Get Williams; Glenn Traded to Packers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Miami Dolphins got their man. But only one of them.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the Dolphins finally completed the trade that will
bring them former Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams, who was
considered expendable by the New Orleans Saints despite averaging
more than 1,000 yards a season.</LD>
<LD>   But Olin Kreutz, the free-agent center the Dolphins were ardently
pursuing, re-signed with Chicago in a deal that included a $7-million
signing bonus and left Miami looking elsewhere to build up its
offensive line.</LD>
<TE>   "The biggest plus for me is I'm coming into a situation where they
already have a good team. They're just adding a good player,"
Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   The Williams trade brought to the Saints some of the picks they
lost when former coach Mike Ditka traded away the team's entire 1999
draft to get Williams. Miami traded a first-round pick in 2002 and a
third-round pick in 2003 that could become a first-rounder depending
on how Williams performs.</TE>
<TE>   Miami also dealt running back J.J. Johnson to Cleveland for a
conditional seventh-round draft pick in 2004, and agreed to terms
with injury-plagued guard Leon Searcy on a one-year, $750,000
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the move Friday was wide receiver Terry Glenn, who was
dealt from New England to Green Bay. Glenn sat out most of last
season after being suspended for four games for a substance abuse
violation and then because of differences with Coach Bill Belichick.</TE>
<TE>   The Packers gave the Patriots a fourth-round pick in the 2002
draft, plus a pick next year that will depend on Glenn's performance.</TE>
<TE>   In other moves, cornerback Aaron Beasley, cut by Jacksonville for
cap reasons, signed with the New York Jets; center Bill Conaty
re-signed with the Buffalo Bills; and fullback Fred Beasley stayed
with the San Francisco 49ers, signing a four-year, $6.075-million
contract.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Motor Racing</TE>
<TE>   Bill Elliott struck a blow for the older drivers, nipping rookie
Ryan Newman for the pole in qualifying for the MBNA America 500 at
Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott was the 42nd of 45 drivers to make his two-lap run and
turned the 1.54-mile oval at 191.542 mph, barely beating Newman's
speed of 191.463. Elliott's Dodge was 16th fastest in an earlier
practice but picked up the pace for his 52nd career pole.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the 24-year-old Newman near the front are two more
twentysomethings--Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Kurt Busch. Earnhardt will
start third in a Chevrolet, Busch fourth in a Ford.</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Fernandez came out on top in a wild finish in the opening
round of qualifying for the Monterrey Grand Prix in Mexico, taking
the provisional pole with a fast lap as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   His lap of 1 minute 18.929 seconds, or 95.965 mph, was well shy of
the track record of 100.665, set in last year's second round of
qualifying by Kenny Brack.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Park will return to Winston Cup competition next week at
Darlington (S.C.) Raceway, where a crash left him with a brain injury
that led to slurred speech and double vision.</TE>
<TE>   The attempt to make NASCAR racing safer after Dale Earnhardt's
death has led to a new rule regarding the placement of seat belts in
the car.</TE>
<TE>   Shoulder belts must be mounted to a specific portion of the roll
cage behind the driver. In another change, the length adjusters on
lap belts must be either at the point where the belt connects to the
frame or where it latches with the other belts.</TE>
<TE>   Former driver and team owner Parnelli Jones will receive the Eagle
One-Shav Glick Award for distinguished achievement in auto racing by
a Californian. Jones will receive the award April 28 at California
Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Andre Agassi handled upset specialist Juan Ignacio
Chela, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 6-1, to move into the semifinals of the Franklin
Templeton Tennis Classic at Scottsdale, Ariz. No. 7 Xavier Malisse,
who beat Wayne Ferreira, 7-5, 6-2, stands between Agassi and his
second consecutive final.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Balcells beat Noam Okun, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, to move into the
semifinals against Rainer Schuettler, who defeated Carlos Moya, 6-3,
3-6, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Track and Field</TE>
<TE>   Senior Nicole Duncan of Cal State L.A. won the women's long jump,
the fourth national title of her career, with a leap of 20 feet 41/4
inches in the NCAA Division II indoor track and field championships
at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA women's team is in fourth place after the first day of
the NCAA Division I indoor track and field championships at
Fayetteville, Ark., with 18 points. Louisiana State is first with 21.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's Tiffany Burgess, Monique Henderson, Jessica Marr and Lena
Nilsson combined to win the distance medley relay.</TE>
<TE>   In men's competition, Alabama's Miguel Pate won the long jump,
adding that to the U.S. title he gained last week. The fifth-year
senior leaped 27-4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   No charges will be filed over a fistfight between baseball Hall of
Fame pitcher Bob Gibson and another man. Police in Nebraska were
unable to corroborate the stories given by Gibson and Miguel Sanchez
about the Feb. 15 fight at a gas station off Interstate 80, Sarpy
County Attorney Lee Polikov said.</TE>
<TE>   A drug investigation of Lance Armstrong's cycling team so far has
yielded no results suggesting the squad used banned substances during
the 2000 Tour de France.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic champion Catriona LeMay Doan of Canada took the women's
500-meter World Cup speedskating title at Inzell, Germany, to extend
her winning streak to 20 races. LeMay Doan was timed in 38.60 seconds
to edge Germany's Monique Garbrecht-Enfeldt by 0.01 of a second.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Buser was the first musher to reach the Yukon River village

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though a playoff bid is unlikely, the Minnesota Wild can still
make life difficult for teams ahead of it in the standings.</LD>
<LD>   Stacy Roest scored the tiebreaking goal with 8:57 left to lift
Minnesota to a 5-3 victory over the Dallas Stars on Friday night at
Dallas, defeating a playoff contender on the road for the second
consecutive night.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a lot of character on this team," Roest said. "We keep
plugging along. We play every shift like it's 0-0 and play within the
system. It was a good effort to come back and win the way we did."</LD>
<TE>   With the score tied, 3-3, Roest scored on a rebound, and Pascal
Dupuis had an empty-netter with 10.5 seconds remaining to end Dallas'
four-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Wild, which defeated St. Louis, 3-0, on Thursday night, was
2-11-2 in its previous 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't overlook them," Stars' center Mike Modano said. "But
maybe we talked them up too much. There's a reason they are where
they are in the conference. We talked ourselves into playing their
type of game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo 3, Montreal 0--Martin Biron stopped 26 shots to record his
second consecutive shutout and lead the Sabres to a victory at
Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Gratton, J.P. Dumont and Brian Campbell scored for the
Sabres in a critical Eastern Conference meeting. With the win, the
Sabres jumped ahead of idle Pittsburgh into 11th place, and within
four points of Montreal and the New York Rangers, who are tied for
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 4, New York Islanders 2--Geoff Sanderson scored twice and
had a third goal disallowed as the Blue Jackets won at Columbus,
Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of hats were thrown on the ice when Sanderson apparently
scored midway through the final period, but the goal was waved off by
referee Tim Peel after a video review apparently showed Sanderson had
kicked in the puck.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Tampa Bay 2--Chris Therien scored a tiebreaking
goal with 9:17 left in the third period as the Flyers won at Tampa,
Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Ranheim had an empty-net power-play goal with 32.2 seconds
left. Justin Williams and Eric Weinrich had the other Philadelphia
goals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington 2, Carolina 2--Ron Francis scored two power-play goals,
rallying the Hurricanes at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Jaromir Jagr and Peter Bondra scored within a 12-second span in
the second period to give Washington a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida 5, Edmonton 4--Niklas Hagman and Ivan Novoseltsev each had
a goal and two assists as the Panthers held off the Oilers at
Sunrise, Fla., to end a seven-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Hagman, Jason Wiemer, Valeri Bure and Byron Ritchie scored
first-period goals for Florida.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, Atlanta 0--Byron Dafoe stopped 21 shots as the Bruins
ended a five-game winless streak and took over the Northeast Division
lead with a victory at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Dafoe's fourth shutout of the season and 26th of his career moved
Boston two points ahead of Toronto, which has played two fewer games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Flyer forward Mark Recchi was suspended two games by
the league for elbowing Calgary defenseman Denis Gauthier in the
head.... Colorado Avalanche right wing Dan Hinote will miss three to
four weeks with an injured left shoulder.</TE>

<LD>"Get out!"</LD>
<LD>   The two most important words of the USC basketball season still
rattle in Jerry Dupree's head, stick in his chest, burn in his shoes.</LD>
<LD>   It was two weeks ago. Dupree and teammate Gennaro Busterna had
failed to attend an unmonitored Sunday afternoon shoot-around.</LD>
<TE>   The next day at practice, when Coach Henry Bibby discovered their
absence, he pointed to the door and raised his voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Get out!"</TE>
<TE>   Dupree quickly dressed and returned to his room, where he plopped
on the bed and stared at the NBA posters on his wall.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan was scowling. Vince Carter was scolding. Allen
Iverson was so disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "I laid there for the longest time, looking up at those guys,
thinking, 'Man, if that is where I want to go, I've got to step it
up,'" Dupree said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday night against Oregon, he did more than just step, he
flew, right up there on the wall next to his heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Dupree is today a poster for what happens when, having tried
everything else, a kid decides to try growing up.</TE>
<TE>   A poster decorated in the Trojans' 89-78 victory over the
ninth-ranked Ducks in the Pacific 10 tournament semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   A poster bordered in Dupree's 12 points, four rebounds, three
assists, two blocks, two steals and near-perfect shooting in only his
fourth start of the season.</TE>
<TE>   A poster containing two new words.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of "Get out!" Bibby was commanding that Dupree "Get in!"</TE>
<TE>   The long-armed, big-haired, heavily tattooed forward got in the
heads of the Oregon shooters with his incessant waving and leaping.
He was a distraction, a disruption, a delight.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to tell you, I see him out there and, that's
intimidating," Brandon Granville said.</TE>
<TE>   The bouncing sophomore transfer also got into the Oregon defense
for eight points during a 24-5 run that clinched the victory. Typical
of his style, his shots were described on the official statistic
sheet with words like "flying," "slam smasher" and "rainmaker."</TE>
<TE>   "He picked up his game on another level," Sam Clancy said.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, the kid who admitted that he mentally quit for
much of this season because he could not handle his coach's toughness
finally got in Bibby's good graces.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the difference in the game," Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   This, after a little postgame kiss-up session, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Said Dupree: "We felt [Oregon] took the championship from us, and
took the coach of the year award away from Coach Bibby, and we wanted
to get it back."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bibby: "OK, Jerry, you're starting tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Don't blame Dupree if he doesn't believe it until his name is
announced today against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   After sitting out last season to attend San Bernardino Valley
College and become eligible to enroll at USC, the former Moreno
Valley Valley View High star thought his dreams had been realized
when he started the first three games this season as Jeff
Trepagnier's popular replacement.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd loved his leaping ability. The media loved those seven
tattoos.</TE>
<TE>   The coach hated his work ethic.</TE>
<TE>   Dupree was benched, and finished the regular season ranked eighth
on the team in minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Even when he played, though, he rarely played.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't call it quitting," he said. "But I quit in my mind. I
couldn't understand what Coach Bibby was trying to do."</TE>
<TE>   Translated, he couldn't understand why Bibby plays no favorites,
gives no advantages to a guy who leaps like Vince, doesn't care who
you are.</TE>
<TE>   "He would tell me to work on my running and rebounding and working
the floor," Dupree recalled. "Then, after I did that, he would have
me working on something else. There was always something else. I
didn't get it."</TE>
<TE>   This is the typical reaction of a new player in Bibby's system.</TE>
<TE>   Just as typical is Bibby's response. "I've always said that if
guys perform in practice, they'll get an opportunity to play," he
said. "It's just taken some of them a while to figure it out."</TE>
<TE>   If Friday was any indication, Dupree has finally done that.</TE>
<TE>   So has Desmon Farmer, whose 15 first-half points kept the Trojans
from being blown away by Oregon's two 10-0 runs.</TE>
<TE>   For the Trojans to stretch themselves through the first two
weekends of the NCAA tournament, a possibility that grows with each
inspirational win, they will need players like Dupree and Farmer.</TE>
<TE>   Their three steady senior stars will need occasional fireworks
crashing around them, occasional winds blowing behind them.</TE>
<TE>   The savvy will need the energy. The experience will need the
excitement.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are the MVP of the tournament," Granville said.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby knew this less than two hours before Friday's game when he
decided to add Dupree to the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   He also knew this two weeks ago when he decided to toss him.</TE>
<TE>   "Get out!"</TE>
<TE>   Dupree still recalls the words as if he just heard them minutes
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody ever said that to me before," he said quietly.</TE>
<TE>   Two difficult Pac-10 tournament games, two splendid wins, people
are saying lots of things nobody around the USC basketball program
has heard before.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Lite</HD>
<DH>Bruins Usually Turn It On at Tournament Time, but This Team
Has Been Pale Imitation of Its Forebears</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The light switch malfunctioned, leaving UCLA standing in the dark, in
shock, unsure of its next move.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins had stumbled in the shadows for weeks, but always
believed when the Pacific 10 Conference and NCAA tournaments began,
they could simply turn it on and fill a room with light.</LD>
<LD>   They'd done it before. Two years ago after a 4-8 start in the
Pac-10, UCLA reeled off eight victories in a row, including two in
the NCAA tournament before losing to Iowa State in the round of 16.</LD>
<TE>   And last season the Bruins bounced back after a loss to Washington
by winning two NCAA tournament games and again advancing to the Sweet
16.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always played our best ball this time of year," forward
Jason Kapono said after the 67-61 first-round Pac-10 tournament loss
to Cal on Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody counts us out, and we come out and win."</TE>
<TE>   But last year the Bruins were seeded high enough at No. 4 to draw
a relatively easy NCAA tournament opponent, knocking off No. 13
Hofstra and No. 12 Utah State in the first two rounds before losing
to eventual champion Duke.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the damage is graver--UCLA is projected to be seeded
No. 8 or 9, meaning its first-round opponent would be solid and a
top-seeded team would await in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   The scenarios are not promising. UCLA could be sent to Washington,
D.C., with No. 1 seed Maryland; to Greenville, S.C., with No. 1 seed
Duke; or to Dallas with No. 1 seed Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Not that any potential top-seeded team relishes the idea of
playing UCLA (19-11) in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   This is still a team that defeated currently ranked Kansas (No. 1
at the time and No. 1 now), Alabama, Arizona, USC, Stanford and Cal.
That never lost to a team with a record under .500. And that ranks
21st in the RPI and ninth in strength of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "If we would have won two or three games [in the Pac-10
tournament], we'd have a much stronger resume," Coach Steve Lavin
said. "But in looking at the whole package of the season, this loss
shouldn't have a dramatic effect on our seeding."</TE>
<TE>   Making enough of a dent in the NCAA tournament for Bruin followers
to forget the disappointing regular season is a longshot, though.
Signs of improvement normally foreshadow a tournament run. A freshman
begins to perform like a veteran, a key player comes off an injury, a
senior steps up and displays leadership.</TE>
<TE>   But the only sign associated with the Bruins reads "yield." They
defer to opponents who are quicker, more determined, more anything.
The freshmen still play as if it is their first week in the program
and the veterans appear fatigued.</TE>
<TE>   No player is going to admit he is tired, but the recent stretch of
nine losses in 17 games clearly has taken an emotional toll.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't played like we deserve to get in," forward Matt Barnes
said. "You need to get hot during the season to get into the
tournament. You've got to be optimistic, but this team is lacking
something."</TE>
<TE>   A reliable point guard, for starters. Freshmen Cedric Bozeman and
Ryan Walcott both show signs of one day becoming solid playmakers.
But they are not ready to lead a team on a tournament run.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman had six turnovers, two points and one assist in 12 minutes
against Cal and Walcott had five turnovers in 26 minutes. Walcott
drew postgame praise from Lavin for scoring 10 points and passing for
six assists, but he made crucial mistakes in the last few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Walcott scored on a floater in the lane to tie the score, 59-59,
with two minutes left, but after a Bear basket he turned the ball
over, leading to two free throws by Cal's Brian Wethers with 47.2
seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   On UCLA's next possession, Walcott slowly dribbled the ball into
the frontcourt while Bruin coaches and a chorus of fans screamed at
him to hurry up. About 15 seconds elapsed before he got the ball to
Kapono, who missed a shot.</TE>
<TE>   But there is plenty of blame to go around. Kapono and Billy
Knight, the team's leading scorers, are not getting open shots. Are
they worn down physically? Knight's ankle bothers him, but Kapono is
sound.</TE>
<TE>   The motion offense Lavin implemented less than three weeks ago
opened to rave reviews in wins over Arizona and Stanford. But its
freelance nature rewards athletic players who create their own shots.
Knight and Kapono need screens and set plays to get open and the
offense isn't obliging.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes, too, has admitted to not feeling totally comfortable in
the motion. Center Dan Gadzuric has been the primary beneficiary
because he has room to maneuver in the key, but his recent hot spell
ended in a six-point, nine-rebound effort against Cal.</TE>
<TE>   Another concern is that UCLA has been unable to win close games
since Knight made a basket at the buzzer to defeat USC on Feb. 6. No
one appears able to play with poise or willing to create a shot with
the outcome in the balance.</TE>
<TE>   The loss to Cal on Thursday surprised no one. It was nothing more
than the continuation of a disturbing trend.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just missing that toughness," Knight said. "At the end I
saw a lot of guys with their heads down. The body language is bad,
and that's something I haven't seen in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Long able to sally forth as if nothing was amiss because they
believed in a tournament-time turnaround, the Bruins are just now
admitting the obvious.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had an awful season," Barnes said. "We've been playing
badly the whole time."</TE>

<HD>Thundering Heard Again</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Another impressive performance for USC,
which knocks off top-seeded Oregon, 89-78, to reach tournament final.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were more than seven minutes remaining in the Pacific 10
Conference tournament semifinal Friday night when Sam Clancy picked
up his fourth foul.</LD>
<LD>   USC held a tenuous five-point lead over Oregon, and there was no
question in Trojan Coach Henry Bibby's mind what he should, or
rather, should not do.</LD>
<LD>   "I never thought about taking Sam out of the game," Bibby said. "I
had eight other people telling me to take him out. Sam got us here.
Sam's going to stay in games."</LD>
<TE>   So Clancy stayed on the floor. The senior power forward's imposing
presence in the paint allowed the Trojans to add to their lead and
USC avenged two earlier losses to the No. 9 Ducks with an 89-78
victory in front of a near-sellout crowd at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The 22nd-ranked Trojans (22-8) will meet No. 15 Arizona (21-9)
today at 3 p.m. in the title game.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, the Pac-10 player of the year, had 16 points, eight
rebounds and two steals in 39 minutes. He had no doubt that Bibby
would let him be after being called for his fourth foul.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew they were going to leave me in the game," he said. "They
learned from their mistake the last time. I just had to just stand
there."</TE>
<TE>   In their previous meeting with the regular-season champion Ducks
(23-8) eight days earlier, USC blew an 11-point lead with 11 minutes
to play after Clancy picked up his fourth foul.</TE>
<TE>   "If he goes out, we're in a tough situation again," Trojan forward
David Bluthenthal said. "But he stayed in and he played a great game.
He played smart and hung in there."</TE>
<TE>   USC had six players in double figures, the second consecutive game
the Trojans had at least five do that.</TE>
<TE>   Senior point guard Brandon Granville and sophomore guard Desmon
Farmer led the Trojans with 17 points apiece, with Granville scoring
12 in the second half and Farmer adding six rebounds and three
steals.</TE>
<TE>   Granville also had nine assists and two steals, and freshman
shooting guard Errick Craven had 14 points and two steals.</TE>
<TE>   Bluthenthal, who entered the game a combined four of 23 from the
field against Oregon, was only two of seven Friday but made all nine
of his free-throw attempts to finish with 13 points after starting at
power forward.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Jerry Dupree started at small forward, his fourth start
of the season, and had 12 points, three assists, two blocks and two
steals.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby said he didn't decide to start Dupree until about an hour
before the game, citing better matchups with the run-and-gun Ducks,
the league's highest-scoring team.</TE>
<TE>   Dupree, who came off the bench along with Farmer to spark the
Trojans in their 103-78 first-round victory over Stanford on
Thursday, has had an awakening after a frustrating regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "It was about working hard every single day," Dupree said. "It was
a reality check."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans administered one to Oregon, which held a 44-31 lead
with 2:55 remaining in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Farmer.</TE>
<TE>   He began attacking the zone with daring drives to the basket,
scoring 11 of USC's 13 points in a 3:40 span to get the previously
stagnant Trojan offense going.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to penetrate the zone and somebody had to step up," Farmer
said.</TE>
<TE>   In limiting the Ducks to one field goal in the last 4:50 of the
half, USC had cut its deficit to three points entering halftime.</TE>
<TE>   But after Oregon upped its lead to seven, 66-59, with 12:54 left,
USC took off again.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans ran the weary Ducks off the court with a 14-2 run that
ended with Clancy's fourth foul, rekindling images of the Trojans
blowing a shot at a league title eight days earlier.</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't happen this time, not with Clancy playing a more
relaxed brand of ball and Dupree playing as if he belonged in the
lineup all along.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is [Clancy] can't get a [fifth] foul," Bibby
said. "He knew it and I knew it.</TE>
<TE>   "He backed off on the defensive end and Jerry picked up the slack
on the other side."</TE>

<HD>Utah State Back in Familiar Setting</HD>

<LD>Utah State lost four starters from last season's team that won the
Big West Conference tournament and upset Ohio State in the first
round of the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Senior guard Tony Brown, the lone returning starter, helped the
Aggies advance into familiar territory Friday night by scoring a
career-high 29 points in a 69-65 victory over Pacific in a Big West
tournament semifinal at the Anaheim Convention Center.</LD>
<LD>   Utah State (23-6), which defeated Pacific in last year's final, is
in the championship game for the third year in a row and the fourth
time in five seasons. The Aggies play UC Santa Barbara tonight at 9
for the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<TE>   "These guys expected to be here," Utah State Coach Stew Morrill
said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown made six of 11 field-goal attempts, including five of nine
three-point attempts, and also made 12 of 15 free throws. He was not
bothered by Pacific's box-and-one defense that had frustrated the
Aggies in a 55-51 loss at Stockton on Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Junior forward Desmond Penigar, who played at Upland High and
Ventura College, scored 20 points for Utah State. His final two came
on free throws with 8.6 seconds left, capping a frustrating 10-second
stretch for Pacific (20-10).</TE>
<TE>   In a game that featured 22 lead changes, Pacific tied the score
for the final time, 65-65, when senior forward Mike Preston scored
from in close with 38 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers fouled Utah State's Toraino Johnson with 18.2 seconds
left, and he made his first free throw but missed his second.
However, Aggie center Jeremy Vague prevented Pacific from regaining
possession by tipping the ball back to Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific fouled again, and after Brown made one of two free throws
with 11.5 seconds left, Pacific's Jono Metzger-Jones fell to the
floor after grabbing the rebound and was called for traveling.
Penigar then made two free throws to seal it.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Utah State will try to be the first team to win three
consecutive Big West tournament titles since Nevada Las Vegas won
three from 1989-91.</TE>

<HD>Sad Ending for Irvine Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Irvine and Utah State have battled for the Big West regular-season
championship the last two years. The conference tournament, however,
became another sad story for the Anteaters.</LD>
<LD>   Sophomore point guard Jacoby Atako made two free throws with 6.3
seconds remaining and foiled the Anteaters' last attempt, helping UC
Santa Barbara pull off a 66-61 victory in the semifinals Friday night
at the Anaheim Convention Center.</LD>
<LD>   It was another shocking ending to a stellar season for Irvine
(21-10). The Anteaters, who have won or shared the Big West
regular-season title the last two years, have been knocked out before
reaching the tournament final in that same time.</LD>
<TE>   Atako coolly sank his foul shots and then delivered the game's
biggest play. With Irvine trailing, 64-61, and desperately trying to
get the ball to its star guard, Jerry Green, Atako knocked the ball
away from him and got it to Nick Jones. Jones finished off Irvine
with a layup at the buzzer to touch off a Santa Barbara celebration.</TE>
<TE>   The win was the first against Irvine for Santa Barbara after
losing both regular-season meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Adama Ndiaye made two free throws with 1:03 remaining to give the
Gauchos (19-10) the lead. Irvine called timeout to set up a play.</TE>
<TE>   But it failed to come through in the closing moments. On its
possession, the ball swung around to forward Matt Okoro. Okoro, in
the game for his defense and rebounding, lost control of the ball and
stepped on the baseline.</TE>
<TE>   Ndiaye made one of two free throws to pad the lead to three. With
23.1 seconds left, Irvine opted to go for the quick two points and
Green, who had 17 points, delivered with a jumper.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara got the ball to Mark Hull on the inbounds pass and
the forward ate up some seconds before dishing it off to Atako.
Atako, who averages only 5.5 points, then stuck another dagger into
the Anteaters.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Irvine came into the Big West semifinals with a
school-record 25 victories and had its eyes on an NCAA berth when it
went cold in a stunning 74-58 loss to Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Green has had his way with the Gauchos. He had 22 points and a
career-high 11 assists in an 81-70 victory at Santa Barbara and came
back with 29 in his final home game to lead the Anteaters to a 71-67
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a great player," Santa Barbara Coach Bob Williams said
prior to the game. "He's the MVP of the league."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara was the Big West's top defensive team during the
regular season and it was among the nation's best in holding
opponents to 37% shooting. But Irvine continued to give the Gauchos
matchup problems.</TE>

<LD>   Utah State (23-6) vs. UC Santa Barbara (19-10), 9 p.m., ESPN--Utah
State, the two-time defending Big West Conference tournament
champion, is in the final for the fourth time in five years. The
Aggies feature the perimeter marksmanship of guard Tony Brown, who
scored a career-high 29 points in a semifinal victory over Pacific,
and forward Desmond Penigar, who had 20 points against Pacific. Santa
Barbara defeated UC Irvine to earn its first appearance in the final.
Utah State swept Santa Barbara this season. The Aggies won, 60-56, at
Santa Barbara on Jan. 5 and 72-64 at Logan on Jan. 31.</LD>

<LD>No. 1 Santa Barbara (24-5) vs. No. 3 Pacific (19-10), 1--There is a
chance the Gauchos, who have won 20 consecutive games, might make the
NCAA field even if the Tigers pull off the upset. Yet Santa Barbara
does not want to leave its fate in the hands of the selection
committee, and the Gauchos want to continue their streak of
consecutive Big West tournament titles, which stands at five.
Pacific, which has won six consecutive games, is enjoying its best
season since winning 20 games in 1994-95.</LD>

<LD>UC Santa Barbara positioned itself for a sixth consecutive Big West
tournament championship Friday with an 83-65 victory over Long Beach
State before 1,061 at the Anaheim Convention Center.</LD>
<LD>   Led by forward Kayte Christensen's 18 points, the top-seeded
Gauchos (24-5), who led, 36-28, at halftime, had no trouble recording
their 17th consecutive Big West postseason victory, and their 20th
consecutive victory this season.</LD>
<LD>   Few Big West teams have felt the Gauchos' steamroller effect quite
as much as fourth-seeded Long Beach (16-13), which has lost its last
21 meetings with Santa Barbara and has had its season ended by Santa
Barbara in the last four conference tournaments.</LD>
<TE>   The script seemed familiar: Long Beach got a quick 11-6 lead until
Santa Barbara slowed the game, used a 15-2 run to take a 21-13 lead
with 9:07 left in the first half, and spent the rest of the game
pulling away.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers, outrebounded, 41-35, and held to 36.4% shooting,
appeared so visibly downcast at times that Coach Dallas Bolla pulled
four starters off the floor early in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "We had talked about wanting to give them our best game," Bolla
said. "The frustration is we didn't do that. There were times we were
focused, and other times we made lots of mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Christensen said her team took note of the 49ers' lowered heads
and sagging shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   "We never expect Long Beach to cave," Christensen said. "But when
we saw their heads down we told ourselves to keep the pressure on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pacific 64, Riverside 47--The third-seeded Tigers came to the
tournament not wanting to be eliminated in the first round, the way
they had been four of the last five seasons.</TE>
<TE>   After wearing down an undersized Highlander team, Pacific (19-10)
finds itself in the tournament championship game for the first time
since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so proud," Coach Sherri Murrell said. "Every time we've
played Santa Barbara we've been in [the game]. I think tomorrow will
be a great finale. If we can play defense like today, we could give
them problems."</TE>
<TE>   Pacific, which led, 33-29, at the half, closed out second-seeded
Riverside's first Division I and Big West season with a 48-31
rebounding margin, including a 19-9 edge on the offensive end, to
compensate for its 39.1% shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Dinges led Pacific with 19 points. Another key was the
defense of Dolinda Meeker, who limited Riverside's top scorer Amy
Houchens to one field goal and four points.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside is 16-13.</TE>

<LD>Al Faux scored 20 points and made a 15-foot jumper with 19 seconds
remaining that lifted San Diego State to a 70-69 victory over Wyoming
in the Mountain West Conference tournament semifinals Friday at Las
Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego State (20-11) advanced to only its third Division I
conference championship game and first since the 1985 Western
Athletic Conference tournament. Tonight, the Aztecs play Nevada Las
Vegas (20-9)--a 76-70 winner over Utah (21-8) in the other semifinal.
The winner gets the conference's automatic NCAA bid. Wyoming (21-8)
and Utah are still in contention for at-large bids.</LD>
<LD>   Marcus Bailey missed a jumper with four seconds left for
regular-season Mountain West champion Wyoming, and Aerick Sanders
grabbed the rebound for San Diego State and was fouled with 1.3
seconds left. He missed both free throws, but Wyoming couldn't get
off another shot.</LD>
<TE>   Bailey finished with a season-high 31 points, making nine of 16
shots--including all four of his three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a late Thursday night Mountain West quarterfinal game, Lou
Kelly scored six of his career-high 35 points in the second overtime
to lead Nevada Las Vegas to a 120-117 victory over New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly's dunk with 56 seconds left put UNLV up 115-109, but</TE>
<TE>   Tim Lightfoot's three-point basket with four seconds left pulled
New Mexico (16-13) within 118-117. Kelly was fouled and made a free
throw, and Cody Payne missed a wild shot from half-court as the
buzzer sounded.</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Douglas scored 32 points and Patrick Dennehy had a
career-high 24 points and 13 rebounds for New Mexico, which missed a
chance to win at the end of regulation and forced the second overtime
on Senque Carey's buzzer-beating reverse layup.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas made a three-point shot with 14 seconds left in regulation
to put New Mexico up 96-95, but UNLV's Marcus Banks was fouled
driving to the basket and made one of two free throws with eight
seconds left. Douglas then bobbled the ball going up for a
three-point shot as time ran out.</TE>

<HD>After Twins, a Team Reborn</HD>
<DH>Bishop Montgomery Lost Cravens but Is Still Winning,
Chasing a Third State Title</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fred Washington simply wanted to enjoy his summer, play a little
travel ball and hang with his friends.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, people tried to spoil his good time by saying how bad
Torrance Bishop Montgomery was going to be this season.</LD>
<LD>   "No twins, no wins," was the nagging refrain they used, what with
the wonder twins, Derrick and Errick Craven, on their way to USC.</LD>
<TE>   The dynasty's dead.</TE>
<TE>   No way would there be a third consecutive state Division III boys'
basketball title for the Knights. Deflate the basketballs, roll the
backboards up into the wall and write off the season.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, the only returning starter, had an option. Listen to
the naysayers--"Everybody had their own little battle cry," he
said--or help the Knights rebuild. He chose the latter.</TE>
<TE>   The process has been more rewarding than rebuilding.</TE>
<TE>   Behind Washington, a junior forward, and Gavin Lee, a senior
forward, the Knights have shone after a slow start, overcoming a
44-point loss to Fairfax in November and a 6-4 start to win the Del
Rey League title and the Southern Section Division III-A
championship.</TE>
<TE>   The Knights (25-6) are also three victories away from another
state title, hosting Palm Desert (26-5) tonight in a semifinal of the
Southern California Regional.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the outcome, Washington can't wait to see some of
the boys of summer.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to show people we weren't no cupcake team," said
Washington, who leads Bishop Montgomery with averages of 22.4 points,
8.3 rebounds and 4.1 assists. "Everybody thought since [the Cravens]
were gone, we wouldn't have the ability. People talked a lot."</TE>
<TE>   With the Craven twins, the Knights lost six games in two seasons.
Errick Craven has already shown his value at USC, averaging 12.1
points and collecting 64 steals to become the first freshman to lead
the Pacific 10 Conference in thefts since California's Jason Kidd in
1993.</TE>
<TE>   But with only two seniors coming back this season, Bishop
Montgomery would have to rely on a team that had Lee, Washington and
five sophomores as its nucleus.</TE>
<TE>   The exuberance of youth was no match for experience. It was never
more evident than in a 95-51 loss to Fairfax in the third game of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   "Our coaches kept us up," said Lee, who, mercifully for him,
missed the game because of an infected insect bite on his elbow.
"They kept after us. They weren't just going to let us fall down and
be a .500 team. We're not a .500 program."</TE>
<TE>   Lee returned, the Knights quickly grew up as a team, and the
6-foot-5 Washington became one of the most dominating juniors in the
region.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Montgomery blew through the Division III-A playoffs,
winning its first three games by an average of 34.3 points before
stunning top-seeded and previously unbeaten Compton Centennial,
57-55, to win the championship.</TE>
<TE>   The victory also served as a potentially positive harbinger: The
Knights defeated Compton Centennial in a Southern Section
championship the previous two seasons before winning the state title.</TE>

Coach Doug Mitchell, who had never experienced a worse loss than he
did against Fairfax in his 13 seasons at Bishop Montgomery.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're winning games, sometimes you miss your weaknesses. We
weren't a real good team earlier in the year, but you could see the

<HD>Texas Tech Pulls Another Surprise in 73-51 Victory</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From nine victories last season to 23 this season--and counting. From
one victory in the five previous Big 12 tournaments to two victories
in two days--and counting.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Bob Knight has revitalized Texas Tech in his first season at
the school, advancing to the semifinals of the Big 12 tournament with
a 73-51 victory against 14th-ranked Oklahoma State on Friday at
Kansas City, Mo.</LD>
<LD>   "Last year at this time I was already back in Lubbock," said
All-Big 12 guard Andre Emmett, who scored 23 points.</LD>
<TE>   The Red Raiders (23-7) defeated Texas A&amp;M in the first round on
Thursday and will play No. 1 Kansas today in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "I've enjoyed working with this team as much as any I've had,"
said Knight, who won three national championships at Indiana but was
fired in September 2000 for violating a zero-tolerance policy.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech certainly impressed Oklahoma State Coach Eddie Sutton,
whose team fell to 23-8.</TE>
<TE>   "They're now one of the 25 best teams in the country," Sutton
said. The Red Raiders will be tested against the Jayhawks (28-2), who
rolled past Colorado, 102-73. Colorado (15-14) ended the season by
losing six of seven games.</TE>
<TE>   The other semifinal will feature No. 4 Oklahoma (25-4), a 63-52
winner against Kansas State (13-16), playing Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The Longhorns (20-10) held off a charge by Missouri (21-11) for an
89-85 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Hammel, longtime sports editor of the Bloomington (Ind.)
Herald-Times, spent the day resting after his seizure on Thursday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "I spoke with him this morning and he said he was feeling much
better," conference spokesman Bo Carter said. "He was trying to find
his glasses. They got lost in all the confusion. They told him it
wasn't a heart attack but a diabetic seizure."</TE>

<HD>A Warm Homecoming for Brand and a Friend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Although he was a Bull for only two seasons, and dreary ones at that,
Elton Brand left his mark on the city.</LD>
<LD>   His homecoming Friday didn't gain the national attention of those
of Michael Jordan and Phil Jackson, who brought the city six titles
and made the franchise a worldwide brand name. Brand, whose Bulls won
nothing of note, turned the city on with his smile and his
generosity, a fact underscored on the way to breakfast Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A homeless man moved toward Brand as a group of Clippers headed
out on a crisp morning. Brand recognized the man immediately,
returning his embrace as the other members of the group gaped in
wonderment.</LD>
<TE>   "He was waiting for me at the hotel," Brand said, refusing to give
the man's name and a bit hesitant to divulge many details about him.
"He was telling me about his kids and everything. He used to be
homeless. Now he's in a shelter."</TE>
<TE>   When he was in Chicago, Brand would see the man outside of
restaurants and nightclubs, asking for money. One frigid night, Brand
decided to press the issue. Did he want the money for drugs or
alcohol?</TE>
<TE>   Assured that the fellow was simply down and out and looking for a
warm place to stay, Brand paid for him to spend a week at a downtown
hotel, and gave him some spending money.</TE>
<TE>   "I put him up for a while," Brand said.</TE>
<TE>   They formed a special bond.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by the reaction of Bull fans Friday, they also formed an
attachment to Brand. After all, he was about all they had to lift
their spirits during the post-Jordan apocalypse.</TE>
<TE>   A United Center crowd of 20,359 gave him a warm reception when he
was introduced before the game. Long before tipoff, hundreds of kids
and young adults crowded near the runway to the court, hoping for an
autograph or hand slap from Brand.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very nice to come back," he said after the Clippers beat
the Bulls, 94-90. "It was nicer to get a victory."</TE>

<HD>Riegger Uses 63 for Lead in Florida</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Riegger completed a course-record, nine-under-par 63 in the
rain-delayed first round, then added a 69 in the second Friday to
take a two-stroke lead over Paul Casey in the Honda Classic at Coral
Springs, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Riegger, who turned pro in 1985 but is still looking for his first
top-10 finish on the PGA Tour, was the clubhouse leader at 12 under
when the second round was halted because of darkness.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm playing well right now," said Riegger, winless in 115 tour
events. "I'm going to go out and try to continue to do the things
I've been doing. They seem to be working pretty good right now."</LD>
<TE>   Only 52 players in the 144-man field finished 36 holes Friday.
Eighteen golfers had yet to tee off in the second round, meaning the
cut will not be made until today.</TE>
<TE>   The final round should be completed on time Sunday, tournament
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Riegger made 12 birdies, three bogeys and an eagle in 33 holes
Friday. Casey was 10 under after 14 holes when the round was
suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Joey Sindelar, looking for his first PGA Tour win since 1990, did
not make a bogey in the first two rounds and was nine under.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm having feelings of a time warp here," said Sindelar, the 1988
Honda Classic champion. "How many decades has it been since I've been
at a Honda Classic press interview? It's been a while."</TE>
<TE>   Neal Lancaster, Mike Sposa and J.L. Lewis were eight under, with
nine others five shots off the lead at seven under.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Flesch, who is three under, recorded the fifth hole in one
in tournament history when he aced the 186-yard fifth hole with a
five-iron.</TE>
<TE>   Riegger had a chance to tie the tournament record of 62 in the
first round but just missed a birdie putt on his final hole, the
par-five ninth.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I was playing well, I was holing some putts, but I wasn't
thinking any particular number," Riegger said. "Once I got it going,
I was just trying to birdie every hole."</TE>
<TE>   Riegger's best tour finish was 12th in the 1993 St. Jude Classic.
This is his fifth full season on tour.</TE>
<TE>   He attributed his two strong rounds to a new preshot ritual.</TE>
<TE>   The 38-year-old golfer from Las Vegas repeats a few phrases to
himself as he prepares for every shot. Not wanting to disclose the
exact language, he says they are words of encouragement that help him
stay focused.</TE>
<TE>   He began the routine two weeks ago after working with a sports
psychologist, and it started to pay off Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike a lot of players, I have problems early in the
tournament," Riegger said. "If I get myself in a position to do well,
I usually do all right. It's just early in the tournament I have a
hard time focusing. That's pretty much what I'm working on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Wi of South Korea shot a five-under 67 for a one-stroke
lead over Ernie Els of South Africa after two rounds of the Dubai
Desert Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Wi put together nine consecutive birdies, but Els' eagle on the
final hole of the day moved him within a shot of the lead. Wi has a
two-day total of nine-under 135, with Els at 136 after his
second-round 68.</TE>
<TE>   Els, who won here in 1994, overcame a bogey on the 14th hole with
what he called one of the best shots of his career--a 213-yard second
shot from the sand to 35 feet. He then made the putt for eagle.</TE>
<TE>   "That shot was one of the best if not the best of my career," said
Els, who won last week's Genuity Championship in Miami. "I am looking
forward to the rest of the tournament, but a lot of guys are in there
who are under par who also have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie had a rough round, shooting a 79 for a two-day
total of 150.</TE>

<HD>Hollendorfer Is Making Another Run at the Derby</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer trots out Cappuchino, Yougottawanna
and Lawn Mower in today's El Camino Real Derby.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine how bad trainer Jerry Hollendorfer's Kentucky Derby luck
might be if he ever ran a horse in the race.</LD>
<LD>   Twice Hollendorfer has shipped horses to Churchill Downs for the
Derby, but both times they couldn't get past the preliminaries. In
1998, Event Of The Year was eight days away from running when he
cracked a knee. Two years later, only two days before the Derby,
Globalize came away second best in a training incident and was
scratched from the race.</LD>
<LD>   But Hollendorfer, winner of more than 3,400 races, is coming back
for more. This year the 52-year-old conditioner has four 3-year-olds
of various size and ability on the Derby trail and is hoping that one
of them actually gets to the starting gate in Kentucky on May 4.</LD>
<TE>   Three of Hollendorfer's charges--Cappuchino, Yougottawanna and
Lawn Mower--are running today at Golden Gate Fields in the $200,000
El Camino Real Derby. The Golden Gate-based trainer is holding back
USS Tinosa to run against Southern California's best in the San
Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita a week from Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Event Of The Year won the El Camino Real in 1998, then added the
Jim Beam Stakes at Turfway Park to roll into Churchill Downs
undefeated in four starts. A nice story line was developing: Event Of
The Year was a son of Seattle Slew, who was the last unbeaten
horse--in 1977--to win the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Event Of The Year would have been the second or third choice,
behind favored Indian Charlie, in the betting, but in his final Derby
workout the colt came back to the barn with a swollen right knee.
Hollendorfer fought back tears when he announced that Event Of The
Year wouldn't be running.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Globalize had survived his final pre-Derby workout.
He had drawn the dreaded No. 1 post and was 50-1 on the morning line,
but Hollendorfer still thought they had a chance. Globalize ran
fourth on his home track, in the El Camino, but on the road leading
up to the Derby he flourished, winning the Turfway Park race and
running second in the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   Then on the Thursday morning of Derby week, out for a gallop at
Churchill, Globalize had an incident with his lead pony, who
retaliated by kicking the colt in the left hind leg. Five stitches
were required to close the wound. Globalize recovered, but he missed
the Derby and the Preakness and, in the Triple Crown windup, the
Belmont Stakes, he was a factor for the first mile before finishing
next to last.</TE>
<TE>   The owners of Globalize--Hollendorfer, the retired stockbroker
Howard Litt and George Todaro, a Washington eye surgeon--are also
partners in Cappuchino, who'll run coupled in the betting with Lawn
Mower because Hollendorfer also owns a piece of that colt.</TE>
<TE>   In the Golden Gate Derby, at 11/16 miles the same distance as
today's race, Cappuchino battled Danthebluegrassman from the start
before losing by a nose to the Bob Baffert-trained colt, who will be
favored in the El Camino. Since the Golden Gate Derby, Cappuchino
dropped in distance on Feb. 10 and beat his stablemate,
Yougottawanna, by 21/2 lengths in the Golden State Mile.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Hollendorfer's trio and Danthebluegrassman, seven other
horses are running in the El Camino. They include Captain Squire,
winner of the Turf Paradise Derby and a gelding who could have been
claimed twice for $32,000 and once for $62,500 when he began his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Baze, who has won both times he has ridden Cappuchino, has
the mount again today, and on Sunday he'll be at the Fair Grounds in
New Orleans to ride Publication in the $750,000 Louisiana Derby.
Publication, winner of the Arlington-Washington Futurity last fall,
ran fourth in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, then in his last start was
fifth--nine lengths behind Siphonic--in the Hollywood Futurity on
Dec. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Publication and six other horses will be hard-pressed to beat
Repent, who became one of the early Kentucky Derby favorites with a
stirring stretch run that produced a 21/4-length victory at the Fair
Grounds three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   That victory notwithstanding, trainer Ken McPeek has bounced
veteran Tony D'Amico off his Derby contenders. Jerry Bailey will ride
Repent Sunday and Edgar Prado has the call on Harlan's Holiday, one
of the favorites for the Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park a week from
today.</TE>

<TE>   Kent Desormeaux was fined $500 and another jockey, Victor
Espinoza, will have to pay $250 in action taken by the Santa Anita
stewards after a whip-wielding incident following the Jimmy Kilroe
Mile last Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Desormeaux won the race with Decarchy and Espinoza finished third
aboard Designed For Luck. Bobby Frankel, who trains Decarchy, said
that his horse was struck three times in the face by Espinoza's whip
during the stretch run.</TE>

<HD>Kobe: I Don't Like Miller</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant wants to know why the questions won't stop.</LD>
<LD>   Real simple. It's because the answers are so good.</LD>
<LD>   It has been eight days since Bryant threw a punch at Reggie Miller
after the Lakers beat the Indiana Pacers at Staples Center. Both
players served two-game suspensions and Bryant is ready to change the
subject to basketball.</LD>
<TE>   But when he was asked about Miller following practice Friday at
the HealthSouth Training Center in El Segundo, Bryant couldn't
resist.</TE>
<TE>   "I dislike him," Bryant said. "I don't like him at all. But when
we are on the court, we will play as professionals."</TE>
<TE>   Then he added as a parting shot at Miller, "He has a lot of
enemies."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant insists he is surprised the fight remains in the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a big deal," he said. "Everybody has
overanalyzed it. A fight is a fight. I'm ready to move on.... Magic
[Johnson] had his fights, Michael [Jordan] had his fights, [Charles]
Barkley had his fights. Larry Bird had his fights.... This is not
like [Mike] Tyson and [Evander] Holyfield. It's ridiculous. It's not
like I bit his ear off."</TE>
<TE>   The talk about Bryant-Miller will ultimately end, when Bryant
stops talking about it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Power forward Samaki Walker, who has missed the last 10 games
because of a hyperextended right elbow, is expected to miss at least
one more. He had hoped to be back for Sunday's game against the New
York Knicks at Staples Center, but that appears unlikely after he was
held out of practice Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not yet ready for contact," Walker said. "This sets me back
a little. They want me to prepare for the long haul."</TE>
<TE>   Walker, who was hurt Feb. 17 when he locked arms with Portland's
Shawn Kemp, admits his elbow is not at full strength and he is still
experiencing pain. But that doesn't mean he wouldn't like to convince
Coach Phil Jackson, trainer Gary Vitti and the medical staff he is
fit to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I can get him [Vitti] in a head lock and change his mind,"
Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   "With the other arm," he added.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An MRI exam taken Friday afternoon revealed that guard Brian Shaw
has a bruised right shoulder. He is listed as questionable for
Sunday.</TE>

<LD>No. 15 Arizona (21-9) vs. No. 22 USC (22-8), today, 3 p.m., Channel
2--The second-seeded Wildcats and fourth-seeded Trojans split their
two regular-season meetings this year. Arizona pummeled USC, 97-80,
on Jan. 17 in Tucson, leading by as many as 31 points. The Trojans,
though, answered at the Sports Arena on Feb. 16, pulling out a 94-89
victory.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC's full-court press defense, which the Trojans run with
frightening frequency and precision, is usually negated by quick
teams with an extraordinarily gifted ball-handler, such as Oregon
point guard Luke Ridnour.</LD>
<LD>   But the Trojans unleashed it on the Ducks on Friday night and rode
the wave to today's Pacific 10 Conference tournament title game
against Arizona. .</LD>
<LD>   "They just kept coming at us with that press," said Ridnour, who
had nine turnovers. "I know I had some turnovers and you can't do
that against a team like USC. We should have controlled the ball
batter when we were up."</LD>
<TE>   USC forced 21 turnovers and got 12 steals.</TE>
<TE>   USC was 22 of 22 from the free-throw line against Oregon, setting
a school and Pac-10 record for most converted free throws without a
miss.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans' previous school record was 15 of 15 against Oregon
State in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona had held the Pac-10 tournament record by making 17 of 18
at the Forum in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   With his eight rebounds and two blocks against Oregon, USC senior
power forward Sam Clancy moved up on two career charts.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, with 824 rebounds, passed Ronnie Coleman (821) and Allen
Young (822) for third place on the Trojans' all-time rebounding list.
John Rudometikin (831) is in second place.</TE>
<TE>   He is already USC's all-time leader in blocked shots with 191, but
Clancy is now tied with Arizona State's Mario Bennett for third place
on the Pac-10 list.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Gutierrez</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The most important assist of the Pac-10 tournament so far belongs
to Lee Zeidman, Staples Center's vice president of building
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Thursday's first round, Zeidman noticed players from
all teams slipping and falling on the midcourt tournament logo.</TE>
<TE>   Late that night, he met with tournament officials who voiced the
same concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Our feeling was, something had to be done before somebody got
hurt," Zeidman said.</TE>
<TE>   The slippery vinyl flooring logo had been purchased by the Pac-10,
from somebody other than Zeidman's usual supplier.</TE>
<TE>   So he made the league an offer it couldn't refuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them I could get the sort of vinyl floor logo we use
during the NBA playoffs," he said. "They agreed."</TE>
<TE>   By Friday afternoon, a new midcourt logo was in place. By Friday
night, the skidding had stopped.</TE>

<LD>NCAA to Investigate Camp</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman said the NCAA plans to review the Student Sports
Elite 11 Quarterback Camp after receiving information about alleged
improprieties.</LD>
<LD>   The camp, located in San Juan Capistrano and run by Mission Viejo
High Coach Bob Johnson, brings together some of the nation's top high
school quarterbacks, who receive instruction from some of the top
quarterbacks on the collegiate level.</LD>
<TE>   "We received information about the camp and, at this point, we
plan to look into the camp further to see if there are any problems,"
said NCAA spokeswoman Jane Janskowski. "I don't know if there is a
specific timetable to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who led Mission Viejo to the Southern Section Division II
title last fall, said the NCAA received its information from an
unreliable source.</TE>
<TE>   "They won't find anything," Johnson said. "It's just a perfectly
run camp."</TE>

<HD>Walton Knows the Drill So Well</HD>

<LD>Luke Walton is a quiet basketball player. He is not prone to
back-slapping, high-fiving, bring-the-fans-to-their-feet dunks or
between-the-leg passes or behind-the-back cleverness.</LD>
<LD>   He is not often heard whooping or hollering or seen wiggling his
rear end or pounding his chest in proud affirmation of a routine
basket or ordinary pass.</LD>
<LD>   Walton leads the Pacific 10 Conference in assists and yet his
coach, Lute Olson, says Walton doesn't get credit for many of his
passes that lead to baskets because those passes come before the
assist pass; they are made to the player who is in perfect position
to make the assist.</LD>
<TE>   To see basketball played well and soundly, keep your eyes on the
6-foot-8, 240-pound University of Arizona junior forward. Watch how
he knows which square inch on the floor is the right place for him to
be and which square inch is the right place for a teammate to catch
the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, the euphoria had not evaporated from USC's 89-78
victory over Oregon in the first Pac-10 tournament semifinal game
when Walton got an assist on Jason Gardner's first basket, scored a
layup of his own and threw a bullet pass to Rick Anderson at
precisely the moment Anderson arrived in front of the basket in
position for a layup. All this in the first three minutes of
Arizona's matchup against Cal.</TE>
<TE>   Up above sat a proud father, a good friend, a man happy to be
known as Luke's dad. Bill Walton is not happy because his son,
against the predictions of many experts who thought Luke too slow and
too floor-bound to star at the top level of NCAA Division I
basketball, is an emerging star.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Walton is happy because his son has found in Tucson what Bill
once found in Westwood at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "A home," the father says. "A philosophy of life. A family led by
a man who should be in the Hall of Fame and who has taught Luke about
life and about basketball. Lute Olson is to Luke what Coach Wooden is
to me."</TE>
<TE>   Luke Walton makes basketball seem a simple game. He makes it easy
for teammates to get shots. He makes the choreography of Olson's
scripted offense seem an easy one-two-three, one-two-three rhythm
when it's not, when it's complicated and filled with pitfalls if
there is not someone wise and talented with the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Olson estimates that Walton handles the basketball 60% of the time
the Wildcats have it. ESPN analyst Dick Vitale has called Walton the
best-passing big man in the country and that's not typical Dickie V
hyperbole.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Walton is proud to say his No. 3 son soaked in the lessons
taught by Boston Celtic teams on which Larry Bird and he starred.
Maybe a boy can't learn basketball instincts--Luke has those too--but
he can learn about the game, including the parts that aren't always
appreciated.</TE>
<TE>   If a vote were taken on who is the star of this Arizona team,
guard Gardner would be the winner. "Jason's the leader of that team,"
Bill Walton says emphatically. "Jason Gardner is a great player."</TE>
<TE>   A father is hard on a son, that's for sure, and maybe it is
Gardner, who leads the Wildcats in scoring and who will be the go-to
man if, say, Arizona needs a last-second field goal to win an NCAA
tournament game. But if Gardner gets the shot he wants, it most
likely will be because Walton gets it to him at the right place at
the right time.</TE>
<TE>   And if Gardner can't get the shot, Walton will get one of his
young teammates a layup. Or Walton will get himself a little jump
hook in the lane. And he'll probably make it.</TE>
<TE>   There has been a secret unfolding of young Luke's career out in
the desert. He pops into Los Angeles a couple times a year when the
Wildcats make their UCLA-USC swing and the local fans, especially
those in Westwood, shake their heads and wonder why Luke isn't
playing for his father's alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   Bill is diplomatic. Kind of.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted Luke to go to a place where the coach would enable him
to find a basketball identity, a style, that would make Luke become a
complete basketball player and a complete person," Bill says. "And
Luke has that. At this point in time, Arizona, under Lute Olson, is a
special place to experience basketball and team. The foundation Luke
has received at Arizona is going to serve Luke well in the rest of
his life, and that's all you can ask of a coach."</TE>
<TE>   You can also ask a coach to teach your son how to improve every
year as a basketball player. That Olson has also done for Walton.</TE>
<TE>   Besides leading the conference in assists--the only non-guard
among the top nine--Walton is also fifth in assist-to-turnover ratio;
sixth in steals; seventh in rebounding (third in defensive
rebounding); and 12th in scoring. There is no more well-rounded
player in the league and maybe not in the country.</TE>
<TE>   With 52 seconds left in the first half, Walton had accepted a pass
from Gardner. Walton was about four feet from the basket and had a
good shot.</TE>
<TE>   But his teammate, Dennis Latimore, a strong but slow-footed
freshman, was even closer to the basket. Walton saw Latimore, saw
that Latimore's defender was taking a step toward Walton and in a
split second Latimore was grabbing the ball and scoring. The right
play at the right time. Again.</TE>

<HD>Doyle's Shots Keep Coming</HD>
<DH>Golf: After taking one-stroke lead at Senior Classic, he
criticizes proposed Major Champions Tour.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Allen Doyle had his way, every tournament on the Senior PGA Tour
would take place at Newport Beach Country Club, he would have the
fairway bunker on the 18th hole removed and everyone involved with
the proposed Major Champions Tour would have their heads examined.</LD>
<LD>   Doyle made those things perfectly clear after shooting
five-under-par 66 Friday in the first round of the Toshiba Senior
Classic to take a one-stroke lead over Hale Irwin and Jim Dent.</LD>
<LD>   Doyle, the 2000 champion,  has nine consecutive rounds in the 60s
at Newport Beach Country Club and has finished no lower than third in
three previous appearances in this tournament.</LD>
<TE>   But his impressive round Friday was spoiled by a bogey on the
finishing hole after he hit his drive near a bunker on the left and
had to take an awkward stance in the bunker for his second shot,
which traveled only 10 feet.</TE>
<TE>   His mood was further spoiled by a question about the Majors
Champions Tour, a proposed tour for players aged 37-55 who have won
at least one PGA Tour major. Doyle, 53, does not qualify because he
never won a PGA Tour event.</TE>
<TE>   "It's greed with a capital G," said Doyle, who operated a Georgia
driving range and made about $35,000 a year before turning
professional in 1995. Last year, he donated a $1-million tax-deferred
annuity to seven charities after winning it in a bonus pool. "It
would absolutely blow my mind if the greed is that bad that they
couldn't see that this will hurt both tours."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed tour would offer a minimum purse of $2 million per
tournament with a winner's share of $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   After a cut to low 20, last place would receive a minimum of
$50,000. It would cater to the older PGA Tour player who is not yet
50 and eligible for the senior tour, yet is no longer competitive on
the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who decides to play the Major Champions Tour would have to
relinquish his PGA Tour and senior tour playing privileges. Doyle
said that since the PGA Tour operates the senior tour, popular
players are morally obligated to play the senior tour after turning
50.</TE>
<TE>   "[They would be hurting]  the tour that made them who they are,"
said Doyle, the 2001 senior tour player of the year and leading money
winner. "If they were that greedy that they couldn't look at their
monthly or quarterly financial statements and see where their wealth
came from, that blows my mind. Everything I am today is because of
the PGA and Senior PGA tours."</TE>
<TE>   At 56, Irwin, the all-time leading money winner on the senior
tour, also would not be eligible even though he won three U.S. Opens.
He likened the idea to a tour of a select group of friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you can attach names to players in that age group," Irwin
said. "Why 37? That's an interesting number. I think it's got a long
way to go."</TE>
<TE>   Irwin, on the other hand, doesn't have far to go in the
tournament. His 67 is his best opening round of the season, not bad
considering he has won and finished second twice in his last three
tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "My objective today was not necessarily to grab the lead," said
Irwin, who could have been lower if not for three missed birdie putts
inside 10 feet. "It was just to get off to a better start so I don't
have so many players in front of me that I have to try and catch up
in 36 holes."</TE>
<TE>   That is imperative in a tournament that has had two nine-hole
playoffs and a five-hole playoff in the last five years. Although
Doyle is the first solo first-round leader in seven tour stops at
Newport Beach, there are 28 players within four shots.</TE>
<TE>   A group of eight, including Tom Watson, Dave Stockton and Gil
Morgan, are two strokes back.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't shock too many people if, when you come to the 18th
hole on Sunday, and it's a pretty good bunch packed in there," Doyle
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Kite, a two-time winner and leading money winner on the senior
tour this season, withdrew before the first round because of back
spasms.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Rachels used a six-iron on the 167-yard 13th hole for the
first hole-in-one in tournament history.  He is four shots behind
Doyle at one-under.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Jose Maria Canizares opened with a six-over 77
and is in 76th place.</TE>

<HD>Clijsters Is Done in One at Desert</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Ousted in her first match by Dechy, top-seeded
woman is affected by long, injury-related layoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>For Kim Clijsters, her last two trips to the Stadium Court here have
been weird winding journeys, ending in the same result. A loss.</LD>
<LD>   The two matches--about a year apart--were strange but, in reality,
nothing alike. Clijsters was on the other side of the net in the
Indian Wells final last year, trying to keep her head as an angry
crowd booed Serena Williams two days after Venus Williams pulled out
of a highly anticipated semifinal match that would have featured the
sisters.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Clijsters didn't last much longer in the Pacific Life
Open, departing after two sets, spraying the ball far and wide at the
Indian Wells Tennis Garden. Nathalie Dechy of France, a former top-20
player, took advantage of Clijsters' erratic play, defeating the No.
1-seeded player, 6-2, 7-5, in the second round.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first time since 1989 that a top-seeded woman lost in
this event in her first match.</TE>
<TE>   The 18-year-old Belgian, who reached a career-high ranking of No.
3 on Monday, had received a first-round bye, and it was her first
match since the Australian Open semifinals, where a sore upper right
arm affected her play as she lost to eventual champion Jennifer
Capriati in three sets. It turned out Clijsters had a stress
fracture.</TE>
<TE>   The long layoff showed.</TE>
<TE>   As if her recent problems weren't enough, Clijsters has been
suffering from a sinus and ear infection, and she sounded hoarse when
she voiced her disappointment after the match.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really looking forward to coming out here," she said. "I've
had such good results here in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Clijsters said she has spent many hours in the gym, working on her
arm and shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still not 100%, it takes a few months," she said. Against
Dechy, Clijsters continually misfired, hitting wide, long and in the
net. She had 55 unforced errors to Dechy's 19 and double-faulted six
times, looking a lot like a player in preseason form.</TE>
<TE>   Even under ordinary circumstances, the talented Dechy would have
been a tough opponent. In their only previous meeting, Clijsters beat
Dechy three years ago in three sets on a hard-court surface.</TE>
<TE>   Dechy has had some of her best results at Indian Wells, defeating
Anna Kournikova here two years ago when Kournikova was a top-10
player. Last year, she defeated Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and reached
the fourth round at Indian Wells.</TE>
<TE>   After a slow start, Dechy has had impressive results in the last
month, losing to Justine Henin of Belgium, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (8), in the
second round in Paris. At Scottsdale, Ariz., she beat Meghann
Shaughnessy and reached the semifinals before losing to Capriati last
week.</TE>
<TE>   She was asked whether she could tell Clijsters was having
difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really think she was having problems on the court,"
Dechy said. "I knew that she was coming back from an injury, so it's
not so easy to take a month off and be back straightaway at a
tournament where you played so well last year. But on the court I
didn't pay attention to anything, I just played the match."</TE>
<TE>   Henin nearly joined Clijsters on the sideline, facing a difficult
fight against 21-year-old left-hander Maja Matevzic of Slovenia. The
third-seeded Henin, who is in the same half of the draw as Clijsters
was, beat Matevzic, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   The other two featured matches on the stadium court went the
distance: Eighth-seeded Elena Dementieva of Russia defeated Amy
Frazier, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3, and Lisa Raymond beat Marissa Irvin of Santa
Monica, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.</TE>

<DH>LUMINOUS EMPTINESS: Understanding the Tibetan Book of the
Dead; By Francesca Fremantle; Shambhala: 408 pp., $26.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH ANDREW ELLENSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Would the Tibetan Book of the Dead by any other name be as popular?
That's one question that Francesca Fremantle's thoughtful and
intricate "Luminous Emptiness" brings to mind.</LD>
<LD>   The real title for what we call the Tibetan Book of the Dead is
the less melodic "The Great Liberation Through Hearing During the
Bardo." Fremantle's book attempts to be no less than a guide for
maintaining one's perceptions and awareness during the bardo (or
transitional state between life and death) in which she shows readers
the complicated process of understanding one of Buddhism's most
sacred texts.</LD>
<LD>   One surprising aspect of Fremantle's revelations about the Tibetan
Book of the Dead, written by "the precious guru" Padmakara in the 8th
century, is that the book is not so much a guide to the afterlife as
a guide for the stages of life in preparation for death. Death, she
asserts, is not the end of existence but a passage into a more
evolved state of consciousness, similar to what is achieved in
transcendent meditative states: "After death, without the grounding
influence of the physical body, events will overtake us with such
speed and intensity that there will be no chance to stop and
meditate. To be of use, meditation must become part of our innermost
nature. That is why this is a book of the living as well as a book of
the dead."</LD>
<TE>   "Luminous emptiness" is the space between life and death before
rebirth. "Space is emptiness and luminosity: luminous emptiness,"
Fremantle says. "Because it is empty, nothing exists, yet because it
is luminous, everything arises from it." Though this description
might seem elusive--and, indeed, it is this language that makes
Eastern religions hard for many Western critics to grasp--it
describes a state of spiritual bliss with abstract language that
forces the reader to let go of a rational, linear thought process.</TE>
<TE>   A British scholar of Sanskrit and Tibetan, Fremantle helped
translate the Tibetan Book of the Dead in the 1970s with her teacher,
Chogyam Trungpa, to whom this book is dedicated. Fremantle is a
student of Indian Buddhism--the purest form of which, according to
her, is practiced in Tibet. The struggle to arrive at a state of
enlightenment is palpable in the meticulous and detailed manner in
which Fremantle lays out its spiritual path. She begins with a
concise explanation of the fundamentals of Buddhism and then moves on
to the more complex ideas of karma, self-deceit, the immaterial, the
ego and consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Fremantle acts as our intellectual guide, unraveling the book's
complicated and powerful imagery and abstract messages. For example,
she presents this daunting passage dealing with the moment of death:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now the bardo of dying is dawning upon me,</TE>
<TE>   I will abandon grasping, attachment and the all-desiring mind,</TE>
<TE>   Enter undistracted the clear essence of instructions,</TE>
<TE>   And transfer into the space of unborn self-awareness,</TE>
<TE>   As I leave this conditioned body of flesh and blood</TE>
<TE>   I will know it to be a transitory illusion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Then she explains how this passage treats dying as a transference,
not an end, like moving from "one place to another," just as one
would move from one room in a house into another. In skillfully
unraveling such knotted imagery and symbolic meaning, Fremantle
points to the meanings that each passage contains.</TE>
<TE>   Her description of Buddhism makes no bones about it: "Buddhism is
a religion of practical methods for spiritual realization." Every
religion might make the same claim, but Fremantle argues that
Buddhism provides the unique ability to provide those steps without
being dogmatic. "[Buddhism] contains many different views and
formulations in response to people's needs and a huge variety of
techniques to suit their inclinations and capabilities. Some of these
may appear contradictory, yet they do not teach different truths;
they present different points of view from which to approach the same
truth."</TE>
<TE>   "Luminous Emptiness" differs from some Western books on
religion--it is not an anthropological study, or even an academic
explanation, that tries to simplify concepts for an unfamiliar
general audience. Instead, this book is a deeply heartfelt guide to
spiritual fulfillment through Buddhism, and the work of a believer
who has studied her tradition with academic intensity and whose faith
has emerged on the other end, undiminished.</TE>
<TE>   The reader who comes to "Luminous Emptiness" with a predisposition
toward believing in Buddhism, and a desire to understand how to use
the Tibetan Book of the Dead as a way of furthering that knowledge,
will be rewarded. However, readers who come with only a passing
interest in the subject and seek a convincing argument for taking on
the Tibetan Book of the Dead will perhaps find Fremantle's work less
than illuminating. Not a book for the casual reader, "Luminous
Emptiness" provides interested seekers with a journey through the
Tibetan Book of the Dead, and Fremantle is an expert guide.</TE>

<HD>Less Time in the Jury Gulag</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A new study finds that the more often citizens serve as jurors, the
more fair-minded they become in deciding cases. That's a good thing
since nearly all courthouses in Los Angeles have cut back juror
service to one day or one trial, so jurors will be called back again
and again.</LD>
<LD>   The annual survey  by the National Law Journal and DecisionQuest,
a jury consulting firm, found that "people with prior jury service
tended to be more neutral and less favorable toward one [party] or
the other." They are, say the survey's authors, "more familiar with
the idea that another side of the story may be coming." In civil
cases, the poll suggests that repeat jurors are less likely than
first-time jurors to be initially biased in favor of the plaintiff.
Jurors who have heard a criminal trial understand that if a defendant
chooses not to take the stand in his own defense, he may not
necessarily be hiding something.</LD>
<LD>   The survey drew from a national sample of respondents, more than
half of whom had already been called to jury duty. The findings hold
a heartening message for the Los Angeles Superior Court as it moves
closer to  ending the onerous 10-day term of jury service in favor of
the one-day-or-one-trial system, used successfully in other states
and counties.</LD>
<TE>   Courts here had a hard enough time filling their jury boxes before
the one-trial system started. Court administrators in L.A. County
feared the one-trial system, fretting that if prospective jurors
weren't assigned to a case their first day and got to go home there
wouldn't be enough bodies to keep trials going. But state law
required the change, and courts in the other 57 counties have since
complied.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2000, the Los Angeles court began the massive shift as
well, starting with the smaller suburban courthouses. By the end of
this month, the gargantuan downtown civil and criminal courthouses
are supposed to have made the change to one day or one trial.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the catch: The court will need an estimated 10,000 jurors
each day to keep its docket moving. That means every eligible citizen
in the county can expect to be summoned for jury duty every year. We
think that's still a better deal for local citizens than serving
those 10 days in the jury gulag, with soap operas droning and jigsaw
puzzles sprawling and people humming to personal CD players, adding
to the excruciating torment of forced mass boredom. If the law
journal survey is any indication, those repeat jurors are likely to
do a better job each time.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In its eagerness to get the proposed secession of three parts of Los
Angeles before voters, the commission overseeing the process is
relying on analyses that have all the clarity of an Enron audit.</LD>
<LD>   The private consulting firm hired to analyze secession proposals
gave a thumbs up Wednesday to a breakaway Hollywood, just as it had
earlier to San Fernando Valley and harbor cities. It is increasingly
likely that all three will be on the November ballot. Yet eight
months away from  votes that could cost Los Angeles almost half its
population and more than half its territory, no one adequately
understands what secession would really do for the breakaway cities
and how it would affect what would be left of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   To put secession on the ballot, the Local Agency Formation
Commission, which controls the process, must find that a breakaway
city would be "fiscally viable" and that breakup would not harm what
would be left of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The Newport Beach-based consulting firm that the commission hired
to make the determination came up with a streamlined plan calling for
Los Angeles to continue owning all assets and providing all services
to the breakaway cities, which would spend virtually all their
revenues paying for these services. Such a plan would be fiscally
sound, it said, since Los Angeles provides those services now.</TE>
<TE>   Well, duh. Hollywood secessionists, being no dummies, hired the
same consulting firm, which came up with the same plan, for a
breakaway Hollywood to continue contracting with Los Angeles for
services.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. officials found plenty of holes in even this simplified
approach and rightly asked for an audit by the state controller. They
were as usual denounced as obstructionists by the secessionists. But
the city is right. Errors or obfuscation in the plans today means
financial trouble for someone down the road.</TE>
<TE>   The larger problem is that secession advocates are already
bypassing the current plan and looking for ways to divide city
assets--buildings, equipment and employees. They might form their own
service departments. Or maybe contract with Los Angeles County
instead. All this in as little as 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   No one has analyzed whether the new cities would be fiscally
viable under these circumstances or asked what would happen to Los
Angeles if the contracts were dropped and it suddenly had to
eliminate departments and jobs. But not to worry: Commission members
and secessionists (some of whom are one and the same, but that's
another story) remain tenaciously optimistic about their grand plans
and their fuzzy accounting. So, of course, was Enron.</TE>

<HD>Poisoning the Superfund</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Superfund, the 20-year-old federal program to clean up toxic waste
sites, was founded on a principle that resonates with every parent:
The company that caused the pollution should clean it up. At most
abandoned factories and mines nationwide, that's what happens;
corporations pay to make the land safe again for use as parks,
schools or homes. If the Bush administration abandons that policy, as
it says it will, the prospect for cleaning up a third of federal
Superfund sites will become quite remote.</LD>
<LD>   The Superfund issue only adds to President Bush's alarming
environmental record. In just over a year, the president has rolled
back scores of federal rules, significantly slowing progress in
cleaning up the nation's air and water and in protecting pristine
federal lands. A top enforcement official at the EPA resigned last
week, venting frustration with cutbacks, slowdowns, loopholes and lax
enforcement.</LD>
<TE>   In practice, of course, Superfund has always been more complicated
than the program's slogan, "The polluter pays." At some sites many
firms had a hand in generating waste, making determination of each
party's share of the cleanup difficult. Polluters of other sites may
no longer be in business. That's why Congress created a trust fund as
part of Superfund. Special taxes levied on chemical and oil
companies, among other businesses, made up the lion's share of this
fund, which pays to clean up these so-called orphan sites.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, business never liked this tax, and when it
expired in 1995 Congress blocked its reauthorization. Some general
tax revenue has gone into this trust fund; now, without new corporate
tax revenue, ordinary taxpayers are paying for half the cost of
cleanup. Even so, the trust fund is likely to shrink to $28 million
next year--a pittance compared with the billions needed.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Bush has decided not to even ask Congress to revive the
corporate trust fund tax, declaring instead that he will shift
Superfund trust fund costs entirely to individual taxpayers, who of
course had no hand in creating the pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of money is already forcing officials at the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to dramatically cut back the number
of sites they can clean up. As fund revenues dwindle in future years,
more cutbacks are certain and the already large backlog of sites will
swell.</TE>
<TE>   Since Superfund began, 1,551 sites have been put on the national
priority list. Cleanup has been completed at 257 sites, and at 552
most of the work is finished. Yet nearly 500 new sites could be added
over the next decade, according to a congressional study. Without
funds no work will be done on them.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration complains, as industry does, that the
Superfund program is poorly managed. The answer, however, is to solve
administrative problems, not starve the program and ignore growing
toxic waste problems.</TE>
<TE>   The president's Superfund directive hands his powerful corporate
campaign contributors another gift, on top of the administration's
failure to press lawsuits and its delay in enforcement actions: the
possibility that, like spoiled children, they will be able to simply
walk away from the messes they've made.</TE>

<HD>Removal of Horses at Will Rogers Park Upheld</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Horse owners will have to temporarily remove horses boarded at Will
Rogers State Historical Park so park officials can evaluate the
animals' impact on the environment, a Superior Court judge ruled
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The judge's ruling essentially upholds an order by Rusty Areias,
director of the state Department of Parks and Recreation, who said in
October that the owners of 45 horses boarded there had 90 days to
load up their animals and move.</LD>
<LD>   The order came as the department plans million of dollars' worth
of repairs and improvements at the park. State officials suspected
that having so many horses boarded at the park had harmed historic
buildings, polluted the ground water and destroyed vegetation.</LD>
<TE>   Horse owners sued in December, noting that although the ban was
technically temporary, it had no expiration date.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody has said when or even if horses are going to return," said
Brentwood resident Kelly Harrison, 30, who has boarded her 9-year-old
quarter horse, Woobie, there for two years. "The fact that they [park
officials] did not keep up the stewardship of the park is not the
fault of the boarders."</TE>
<TE>   The group of horse owners and other equestrians plans to appeal
Friday's decision before the removal deadline of April 5, said Eric
George, the group's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   He contested the need to remove the horses to conduct further
tests: "There's no sound scientific evidence that's been offered as
to why the horses have to be vacated even on a temporary basis."</TE>
<TE>   An outside vendor runs the boarding facility for the 25 privately
owned horses still kept there. Twenty others were moved out after
Areias made his order.</TE>
<TE>   George said the park, deeded to the state in 1944 by Will Rogers'
widow, Betty, was intended to be used as a "memorial and historical
monument" to the comedian and entertainer. If not adequately
maintained, ownership of the park reverts back to his descendants.</TE>
<TE>   The deed gave all members of the public the right to use the
park--horse boarders included, George said.</TE>
<TE>   But Rogers' grandchildren, such as Chuck Rogers, became concerned
that too many of the park's resources and staff were devoted to
maintaining the boarding concession at the expense of the historical
barn and other buildings on the property above Pacific Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   "The equestrian part of park was the tail wagging the dog," said
William Abbey, deputy attorney general representing the parks
department. "Much too much was being spent on that as opposed to
other parts of the park."</TE>
<TE>   Rogers' descendants said the boarding amounted to private use of a
public park, noting that some horse owners were wealthy, such as
Arnold Schwarzenegger.</TE>
<TE>   But horse owners argued that "an active equestrian presence" was
mandated in the park's general plan, and that removing boarded horses
would dramatically change that.</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk about equestrian presence, it's not just a horse,"
said Steve White, superintendent of the parks region that includes
Will Rogers. "The presence is manifest in the historical footage, in
the statuary, in the polo field itself."</TE>
<TE>   "There were lots of other elements of his life and the life of his
family" aside from horses, Abbey said.</TE>
<TE>   And the order terminated only boarding of horses. Horses can still
be ridden on trails and polo games will begin again as the season
starts at the end of April.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Terry Friedman said the
matter is ultimately about the terms of the deed, not the horses.</TE>
<TE>   "I know why this matter has taken on great interest," Friedman
said. "Horses are beloved. I love horses too."</TE>
<TE>   But the case did not violate the terms of the deed or amount to
revision of the general plan, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman encouraged boarders to join an equestrian advisory
committee set up to discuss future uses of the park. The group
already has met twice, said Steve Capps, assistant deputy director of
communications for the parks department.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, horse owners will have to look for new stables in
Burbank, Topanga or elsewhere. There aren't any other places on the
Westside to house horses, said horse owner Harrison. "For many of us
who work, it's going to cut largely into the time we spend with our
animals," she said.</TE>

<HD>PUC Pick Could Face Conflicts</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>More than any recent appointee, Gov. Gray Davis' latest choice for
the Public Utilities Commission has a financial and professional
history that could pose conflicts in his new role.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Peevey takes a seat on the powerful PUC today,  even as he
rearranges his investments and cuts business ties in order to serve
as a regulator without being forced to recuse himself from agency
actions. Just this week, Peevey resigned from his position as
chairman of a Pasadena energy company he founded 18 months ago.</LD>
<LD>   In picking Peevey to replace Republican Richard A. Bilas, who
resigned suddenly from the PUC last week, Davis heralded Peevey's
three decades of experience in the energy industry.</LD>
<TE>   But consumer advocates say that Peevey's interest in issues facing
the PUC will not disappear no matter what he does to disentangle his
business connections. His former business associates will have
matters before the PUC, critics note, and Peevey thus will be making
important decisions that affect onetime colleagues, customers and the
like.</TE>
<TE>   A key vote Peevey will soon face on the PUC, for example, involves
businesses seeking to buy electricity from non-utility energy
companies of the sort that he once ran.</TE>
<TE>   ''He's going to be voting on things that affect the interests of
his former customers,'' said Harry Snyder, senior advocate for
Consumers Union. ''The people who paid him, bought his energy
services in the past, will have billion-dollar issues in front of the
PUC, and Mike Peevey will have one of the five votes affecting his
customers' interests.''</TE>
<TE>   Peevey founded a company, New Energy Ventures, to compete for
electric utility customers in California's new era of deregulation.
He sold the company in 1999 for roughly $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Peevey accused his critics of ''stereotyping'' him by assuming
that because he is a former president of Southern California Edison
he will be somehow biased as a regulator.</TE>
<TE>   ''If you carry their argument to the logical extreme,'' Peevey
said, ''because I was a utility executive I shouldn't be on the
commission because I'll be one-sided. Pretty soon the only people you
get appointed are dispassionate with no experience. I think you need
a cross-section of people to bring various expertise.''</TE>
<TE>   With a varied career that ranges from U.S. Department of Labor
economist to California State University trustee, Peevey, 64, said he
accepted the PUC job out of a sense of public duty.</TE>
<TE>   His stint lasts until the end of the year, when he could be
appointed to a full six-year term. Taking the job has involved some
personal sacrifice, Peevey said.</TE>
<TE>   He resigned Friday as chairman of TruePricing Inc., the Pasadena
power technology company he helped create 18 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   He has also resigned from the board of directors of Excelergy
Corp., a Massachusetts developer of software for energy companies.
And he said he is now combing investments to purge stock that could
pose a conflict to a regulator of electric utilities, private water
companies and telecommunications companies.</TE>
<TE>   Peevey, a Democrat, said he sold off energy stocks before January
2001, when he agreed to serve as an unpaid energy advisor to Davis.
He helped the governor accelerate power plant construction, establish
conservation programs and draft financial rescue plans for Edison and
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric.</TE>
<TE>   ''I didn't want to be accused of anything even though I was a
volunteer,'' said Peevey, who  did not publicly disclose his
financial interests as the state's paid energy consultants were
required to do.</TE>
<TE>   Recent amendments to financial disclosure forms filed by his wife,
Assemblywoman Carol Liu (D-La Canada Flintridge), show that Liu sold
more than $100,000 of PG&amp;E stock in March 2000 and more than $100,000
of Edison stock in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The forms also show that Liu and Peevey purchased more than
$10,000 worth of Enron stock last June and sold it two months later.</TE>
<TE>   TruePricing, where Peevey served as chairman until Friday, has
business pending before the state's relatively new public power
agency, the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority. The
agency was created as a result of last year's electricity crisis, and
it is authorized to spend $1 billion on energy conservation efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, TruePricing submitted a proposal to the power authority
seeking state financing for the installation of meters and computer
software it had developed.  The equipment would allow small
businesses such as a  restaurant to track electricity consumption
hour by hour.</TE>
<TE>   The TruePricing proposal and 10 others will be considered by the
public power authority board on Friday. The power authority is
chaired by S. David Freeman, who worked alongside Peevey when both
served as unpaid energy advisors to Davis last winter.</TE>

<HD>Man Sues, Saying Victim of Plane Crash Was Son</HD>
<DH>Courts: The plaintiff says his ex-lover and their child
were aboard. Pilot negligence is alleged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles man who says he is the father of one of the victims has
filed a lawsuit in connection with the crash of a charter jet in
Colorado a year ago that killed all 18 on board. Julius Szabo, 83,
claims in the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court that pilots
took unnecessary risks in attempting to land at the airport in Aspen
during a nighttime snowstorm.</LD>
<LD>   Cockpit recordings released by the National Transportation Safety
Board show that the pilots were having trouble seeing the ground as
the plane approached the airport, which is surrounded by steep,
mountainous terrain.</LD>
<LD>   The Gulfstream III jet, which failed to line up properly with the
runway, slammed into a hillside and burst into flames.</LD>
<TE>   Those killed, in addition to the two pilots and a flight
attendant, included Robert Neu, a millionaire financier who had
chartered the flight, and 14 of his friends and business associates.</TE>
<TE>   Among them were Mario Aguilar, 26, of Los Angeles; and Aguilar's
56-year-old mother, Maria Valenzuela.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews last year, Szabo told The Times that he met
Valenzuela in the early 1970s, while both of them were working in the
kitchen of a convalescent home in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He was a 55-year-old Jewish bachelor who had escaped the Holocaust
in 1939, fleeing from Romania and living in Israel before moving to
Los Angeles in 1970. She was 25 and married, a Mexican immigrant from
the state of Sonora.</TE>
<TE>   Szabo said that when he met her, Valenzuela's marriage was
troubled and she was unable to conceive. He said that in the months
that followed, he and Valenzuela fell in love and he fathered a
child, who was reared as Mario Aguilar by Valenzuela and her husband,
whose surname was Aguilar.</TE>
<TE>   Szabo said the boy grew up believing that the Romanian was merely
a close, grandfatherly friend of the family.</TE>
<TE>   When Mario Aguilar was 18, he was told that Szabo was his father.
Szabo showed a reporter what he said was a letter written to him by
Aguilar a few years later that read, in part: "I want you to know
that there is no doubt in my mind that you are my father and that you
have always loved me since I was born."</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela's husband died several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Gulfstream III was making an instrument approach to Aspen last
March, which meant that the pilots, Robert Frisbie and Peter
Kowalczyk, were using their instruments to guide the plane to the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   However, even on an instrument approach, pilots are required to be
able to see the ground before they touch down at Aspen.</TE>
<TE>   At least one plane ahead of the Gulfstream abandoned its landing
attempt because of the poor visibility.</TE>
<TE>   In the suit filed Thursday, Szabo accuses Frisbie and Kowalczyk of
willful negligence in attempting the late-evening flight in the
worsening snowstorm.</TE>
<TE>   "The pilots knew the weather was marginal before takeoff, and
visibility continued to deteriorate, yet they took off anyway," said
Szabo's lawyer, Brian J. Panish of Santa Monica. "They tried to beat
the curfew and hurried a risky landing in Aspen to avoid the expense
of getting detoured to a safer but less convenient airport."</TE>
<TE>   The pilots are named as defendants in the suit, along with the
plane's owner, Avjet Corp.; a charter company, Airborne Charter; and
Cinergi Pictures Entertainment, a co-leaser of the plane. The suit
does not make any specific request for damages.</TE>
<TE>   Since the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration has banned
nighttime instrument landings at Aspen.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A snowboarder was killed at the Sugar Bowl Ski Resort near Lake Tahoe
on Friday afternoon when the ledge he was standing on collapsed,
hurling him down a mountainside and burying him in a deep snowbank.</LD>
<LD>   The victim, a man in his 20s whose name was withheld pending
notification of relatives, was snowboarding with two friends when the
accident occurred at the 8,300-foot level on Mt. Judah, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   Placer County Sheriff's Sgt. Brian Whigham said it took search
dogs 45 minutes to dig down to the victim. He was airlifted to Tahoe
Forest Hospital in Truckee, where he was pronounced dead.</LD>
<TE>   The man's two companions were able to leap to safety and were not
injured, Whigham said.</TE>

<LD>George Caravalho, Santa Clarita's city manager for the last 14 years,
is a finalist for the same position in the city of Riverside,
according to officials in both cities.</LD>
<LD>   Caravalho, 63, who joined the city of Santa Clarita six months
after it was incorporated, had previously been a city manager in
Bakersfield and San Clemente. Also in the running in Riverside are
city officials in Yuma, Ariz., and Reno.</LD>
<LD>   A decision on the Riverside job, which has been open since July,
could be made by Friday. In May, Caravalho came under fire from some
Santa Clarita council members over concerns that residents were being
overcharged for garbage service.</LD>

<LD>WASHINGTON--The spiritual leader of the world's 250 million Orthodox
Christians told U.S. Roman Catholic leaders this week that persistent
and historic theological differences must not harm relations between
the Eastern and Western churches.</LD>
<LD>   Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, concluding a three-day visit to
Washington, told Cardinals William Keeler of Baltimore and Theodore
McCarrick of Washington that "we, as Christians, are charged by God
himself to restore our unity, so that the world will believe in the
divine mission of the church of Christ."</LD>
<LD>   Relations between the two churches have been cool since the Great
Schism of 1054.</LD>
<TE>   Bartholomew made clear that he did not intend to try to bridge
those differences.</TE>
<TE>   But he said both sides must make distinctions between "essential
and nonessential differences so that the church does not appear
divided due to matters of secondary importance."</TE>

<LD>DALLAS--Moderate Baptists in Texas have pledged $1 million to help
Southern Baptist missionaries who decline to endorse a conservative
doctrinal statement they are being asked to approve.</LD>
<LD>   The moderate Baptist General Convention of Texas said it created
the fund after hearing from more than 60 missionary families who said
they could not sign the statement, which opposes women pastors and
says wives should "submit graciously" to their husbands. The
doctrinal statement also created controversy when it was initially
approved in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Some missionaries feared they would lose their jobs if they
resisted, the Texas group said.</LD>
<TE>   "The call to stand by those who are being asked to put either
calling or conscience at risk cannot go unanswered," said Charles
Wade, executive director of the Texas convention. "We must provide
places of refuge and renewal."</TE>

<LD>The number of American Jewish households that affiliate with a Jewish
congregation has increased by 15% since 1990, even as the "core
Jewish" population declines, reports a new demographic survey.</LD>
<LD>   According to the American Jewish Identity Survey 2001, which was
conducted by the Center for Jewish Studies at the Graduate Center of
the City University of New York, 1 million households affiliate with
a congregation, up from 880,000 households a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   An additional 1 million Jews say they are affiliated with a
non-congregational organization, such as a Jewish community center.</LD>
<TE>   The number of "core Jews"--who consider themselves Jewish by
parentage or upbringing but do not practice Judaism--has declined
from 5.5 million to 5.3 million people.</TE>

<LD>TIVERTON, R.I.--An Islamic art exhibit in Town Hall was removed then
put back on display after a dispute over whether the show violated
the separation of church and state.</LD>
<LD>   Town Administrator James Towers ordered the posters removed Feb.
25, the first day of the exhibit's planned two-week run, after some
residents and town employees complained.</LD>
<LD>   Three days later, Town Solicitor James Donnelly concluded the
poster display was educational and didn't violate the Constitution.</LD>
<TE>   The 25 posters were part of a series of lectures and book
discussions called "Insights Into Islam," organized after Sept. 11.</TE>

<KH>EL TORO'S FUTURE</KH>
<HD>Suddenly, a Sale's on the Horizon</HD>
<DH>Newport Beach's Rep. Christopher Cox is one of the few who
have long favored selling the closed Marine base.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For nearly nine years, officials with the Department of the Navy
watched from afar as Orange County grappled with what should happen
to the El Toro Marine base, which closed in July 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Washington got a whole lot closer this week when the Navy
announced its intention to sell all or part of the base at public
auction; it will make a final decision next month.</LD>
<LD>   The news stunned many in Orange County, who envisioned getting the
entire base for free to build a large urban park and nature preserve.
Voters on Tuesday approved rezoning the base for parkland and open
space to allow the construction of a university, museums, sports
complex, entertainment facilities and other uses, including student
housing and recycling centers.</LD>
<TE>   The main governmental voice promoting the sale of the land was
Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who suggested eight years ago
that selling El Toro would allow the Department of Defense to recoup
its cost for relocating troops to San Diego from El Toro and the
closed Tustin helicopter base. So far, that price tag exceeds $1
billion, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's surprise announcement had its seeds a year ago, Cox
said. Though President Clinton's administration was chilly to
discussions about selling El Toro, the tide turned when Donald
Rumsfeld became secretary of defense under President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   One of Rumsfeld's first actions was to review the bases approved
for closure in 1993, including El Toro and Tustin, Cox said. The
intent for that round of closures was to move land from the military
inventory and produce as much as $4 billion in income to help pay
consolidation costs. But the resulting base sales generated less than
$70 million, Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   As time passed, Congress became more anxious to clear the
closed-base inventory; in 1996, changes in federal law allowed bases
not set aside for public uses to be turned over for free to local
agencies instead of sold. California had the most closed bases: 29.</TE>
<TE>   Closing El Toro cost the Pentagon a lot of money, Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the terrorist attacks Sept. 11--and "everyone started
getting their priorities straight, including the Pentagon," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The military had a different mission and a renewed need for money
to fight terrorism, Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's decision to make a final determination next month on El
Toro, including whether to sell the land at a public sale, reflects
that new resolve, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Navy would have been equally determined to dispose of the
base for an airport had Tuesday's vote gone the other way, he said.
With the vote against the airport, he said, the Navy has pledged to
follow the wishes of voters and to dispose of the base for
non-airport uses.</TE>

<LD>A Spanish-language disc jockey pleaded not guilty in a Burbank
courtroom Friday to charges that he sexually assaulted two
14-year-old girls he met through his radio show.</LD>
<LD>   Firmo Martin Rossetti, the on-air morning host on Century
City-based KLYY-FM (107.1), entered his plea during formal
arraignment on two dozen felony counts of child molestation, rape and
oral copulation.</LD>
<LD>   Rossetti is being held on $1.5 million bail. During his brief
appearance, Los Angeles County Judge Chesley McKay set a bail review
hearing for March 21 and a preliminary hearing for April 22.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted on all counts, Rossetti, 38, could face a maximum of
24 years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   The disc jockey's attorneys, James Goldstein and Victor Mastrella,
reiterated claims of their client's innocence after Friday morning's
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Rossetti was arrested Feb. 28 and charged with sexually assaulting
a Long Beach girl in August and January. The assaults were reported
by the girl during a visit to her doctor for a sports injury.</TE>
<TE>   A week after Rossetti's arrest, relatives of a second girl from
the San Gabriel Valley contacted authorities, said Burbank Police Lt.
Tim Stehr. Police said the girl told them she and Rossetti had five
encounters from September to January.</TE>

<LD>A Spanish-language disc jockey pleaded not guilty in a Burbank
courtroom Friday to charges that he sexually assaulted two
14-year-old girls he met through his radio show.</LD>
<LD>   Firmo Martin Rossetti, the on-air morning host on Century
City-based KLYY-FM (107.1), entered his plea during formal
arraignment on two dozen felony counts of child molestation, rape and
oral copulation.</LD>
<LD>   Rossetti is being held on $1.5million bail at the Twin Towers
jail. During his brief appearance, Los Angeles County Judge Chesley
McKay set a bail review hearing for March 21 and a preliminary
hearing for April 22.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted on all counts, Rossetti could face a maximum of 24
years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   The disc jockey's attorneys, James Goldstein and Victor Mastrella,
reiterated claims of their client's innocence after Friday morning's
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Rossetti, 38, is married and has a young child. Goldstein
acknowledged that Rossetti knew the first girl to come forward, as
well as her family. She had visited the station and her family had
invited him to their Long Beach home, Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   But at no time, Goldstein said, did Rossetti "engage in any
improper conduct with either girl."</TE>
<TE>   Rossetti, who uses the on-air name "Hector Rocksetti," was
arrested Feb. 28 and charged with sexually assaulting the Long Beach
girl in August and January.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that Rossetti picked the teen up at her home
and told her he was taking her to a recording session. Instead, he
allegedly had sex with her in his car and again at his apartment in
the 1500 block of Catalina Street in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   He forced himself on the girl again five months later while the
two were in his apartment, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The assaults were first reported by the girl during a visit to her
doctor for a sports injury.</TE>
<TE>   A week after Rossetti's arrest, relatives of a second girl from
the San Gabriel Valley contacted authorities, said Burbank Police Lt.
Tim Stehr.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the girl told them she and Rossetti had five
encounters from September to January.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, the girl characterized their meetings as part
of a relationship and said none of the incidents involved force.</TE>

<HD>El Toro Park Plan Stands, Officials Insist</HD>
<DH>Land use: Voters' zoning choice still governs the former
base, despite the Navy's intention to sell it, as long as the county
retains control--but not if a city annexes it.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials across Orange County scrambled this week to quell fears
that the Navy's announcement that it intends to sell all or part the
former El Toro Marine base scuttles the park plan voters approved
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The question isn't whether the park will be built, officials said,
but whether the land will be sold to a private developer, turned over
for free to a government entity--or a combination of both.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever happens, Measure W, which voters approved, restricts what
can be built on the base, limiting development to such things as a
university and student housing, museums, a sports complex, recycling
centers and entertainment facilities--as long as the land stays under
county control. If it is annexed by a city, Measure W's zoning laws
no longer apply.</LD>
<TE>   The Navy probably will sell some of the land and give other
portions away, said Paul Eckles, executive director of the El Toro
Reuse Planning Authority, a coalition of south Orange County cities
that has fought the airport for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors, which has sole local authority over the
fate of El Toro, and South County cities, led by Irvine as the city
most affected, should agree quickly on a new reuse plan for the base,
Eckles said. Without agreement, however, "the Navy is going to say,
the best way to deal with this is to go to public sale."</TE>
<TE>   County planners are working on several scenarios to present on
April 16, when supervisors are scheduled to meet to decide what to do
next.</TE>
<TE>   The planners, however, don't know if a new proposal can be
prepared in time to meet the Navy's April 23 deadline for making a
final decision on whether to sell.</TE>
<TE>   "We're breaking new ground in many respects now that the Navy
wants to put the land up for sale," said Gary Simon, the county's El
Toro project manager. "There are just a whole series of questions."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Navy released its environmental review of El Toro,
written before Tuesday's vote. Not unexpectedly, it still regards a
commercial airport serving 28.8 million passengers a year by 2020 as
the "preferred alternative."</TE>
<TE>   The study recommends that the Navy dispose of 3,763 acres of the
4,738-acre base; 905 acres were set aside for wildlife habitat
through the Federal Aviation Administration and will stay in federal
hands. Another 70 acres will be turned over to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   In a one-page acknowledgment of Measure W's passage, added to the
document, the three-volume study concludes that either aviation or
nonaviation uses for El Toro are possible, but indicated that the
Navy would sell the base. The study was completed by the Navy and the
FAA.</TE>
<TE>   "If the decision [of the Navy] is to dispose of this property for
nonaviation uses, the most efficient way of achieving the laudable
goal of placing this property on the local tax rolls is for the Navy
to dispose of the property by public sale," the study said.</TE>
<TE>   In a blow to a second airport plan that had once competed with the
county's proposal, the study concluded that the V-plan--which
supporters have resurrected and now hope to put on the November
ballot--is "not a reasonable alternative." The study quoted from the
county's environmental analysis that planes departing to the south
over the coast near Newport Beach would create too much noise for
4,100 future homes the Irvine Co. plans for west of the San Diego
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Villa Park Councilman Robert E. McGowan, who submitted the V-plan
Thursday for review by county election officials, said he'll argue to
the Navy that the homes aren't built yet and the land could be used
in other ways. The Irvine Co. has previously said it opposes the
V-plan.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he'll recommend that supervisors consider a new
development plan for El Toro that contemplates not only what happens
to the base but also to a 14,000-acre zone around it where homes have
been prohibited because of noise from military jets, a restriction
continued since the base closed in July 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors also could decide to withdraw the
county's application for the land, airport or not. And there is no
guarantee the Navy will sell the land or give all or part of it to a
local government entity.</TE>
<TE>   For example, it could be handed over to another federal agency,
including the FAA for a future airport--a move supported by
pro-airport Supervisor Chuck Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors have indicated they are not willing to accept
responsibility for cleaning up toxins at the base, listed as one of
the most polluted federal sites in the country. The federal
government has pledged to clean the site, but offers no timetable for
doing so and no funding guarantee.</TE>

<HD>Local Architect Receives 25 Years to Life in Slaying of
Madam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles architect was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in
prison for killing his then-girlfriend's madam in her Studio City
luxury apartment in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Despite pleas for leniency from prominent architects and other
friends of the defendant, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge
Darlene Schempp ordered Alexander Gabay, 38, of Los Angeles to serve
the mandatory prison term.</LD>
<LD>   ''I wish I had discretion to exercise leniency,'' Schempp said.</LD>
<TE>   In January, a Van Nuys jury convicted Gabay of second-degree
murder in the Aug. 17, 2000, beating and shooting death of Lyudmyla
Petushenko, 29.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides agree that Petushenko, a prostitute, and Gabay's
23-year-old girlfriend, Oxana Meshkova, had argued in Petushenko's
bedroom before she was killed.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, Gabay, a former Navy Seabee, denied shooting Petushenko.
He testified that Meshkova used his gun to fire the fatal shot.</TE>
<TE>   But on the witness stand, Meshkova, once Gabay's co-defendant,
accused her former boyfriend of intervening in the argument and
killing Petushenko. Meshkova had initially been charged with murder,
but prosecutors dropped the case against her.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Jane Winston said Gabay was
trying to steal information from Petushenko to open his own
prostitution ring. And there was another motive, she said:
''Petushenko was trying to sell [Meshkova] into prostitution."</TE>
<TE>   Meshkova owed Petushenko $3,000 for transportation to the United
States. Petushenko might have sold her to a pimp to recover her
costs, Winston said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the six women who entered the United States with Meshkova
were sold to a pimp named Garrick, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Ronald D. Hedding said Gabay was trying to help
Meshkova, who didn't speak English and had no friends or family in
Southern California. ''You have a man who was trying to help a woman
out,'' Hedding said.</TE>
<TE>   Meshkova met Gabay at a party a few days after her July 4, 2000,
entry into the United States. Within days she had moved into Gabay's
downtown L.A. loft and refused to work as a prostitute for
Petushenko.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, a witness who drove the couple to Studio City on the day
of the killing testified that Gabay told him he had shot Petushenko,
Winston said. The witness testified he saw Gabay melt part of the
murder weapon. Authorities also found blood on Gabay's shoe that
matched Petushenko's DNA, Winston said.</TE>

<TE>   But Gabay's family and friends don't believe he killed anyone.</TE>
<TE>   ''The person I knew for 23 years could not commit the crime that
he is accused of,'' said attorney Alex Berlin, who was among a dozen
supporters at the sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Gabay, a naturalized citizen who immigrated with his family from
Moscow in 1979, was a self-employed architect, who worked on a house
later featured in Architecture magazine, according to letters from
friends to the court.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated from Fairfax High School and received a bachelor's
degree from the Southern California Institute of Architecture in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   He had no prior criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   ''He is like a knight,'' his mother, Zina Koff-Gabay, said outside
the Van Nuys courthouse. ''He wanted to defend his girl.''</TE>

<LD>Pierce College will hold a groundbreaking ceremony next week for a
two-acre botanical garden that is expected to attract students as
well as birds and butterflies.</LD>
<LD>   The $425,000 garden--with plants, waterfalls, Braille signage,
benches and a small amphitheater--will be built on a large lawn in
the middle of campus, said Davia Solomon, president and chief
executive of the Foundation for Pierce College, which is raising
money for the project. A pathway through the middle of the garden
will create a ''biological time line'' highlighting plant life
through the ages.</LD>
<LD>   ''It will be a pleasant place to be, even if you're not interested
in studying plant material,'' college President Rocky Young said
Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Plants will be labeled and grouped by categories, including
Australian, desert/sagebrush and coastal sage/chaparral.
Mediterranean greenery will surround a waterscape exhibit, which will
include a 3,800-square-foot pond. Some plants will be specifically
chosen to attract birds and butterflies, Solomon said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the plot will have more greenery than it does in its
current form as a lawn, gardeners will use less water to maintain it
because the plants will be drought-resistant, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Students in many disciplines could benefit from the garden.
Landscape maintenance and design students will help with the upkeep,
life science and botany students will study the plant life, geology
students will learn from the time line and the English department has
expressed interest in using the garden for writing groups.</TE>
<TE>   ''The speech department wants to use the amphitheater so kids can
give speeches outside and learn to project their voices,'' Solomon
said.</TE>
<TE>   The S. Mark Taper Foundation Botanical Garden at Pierce College
was named for the organization that contributed $75,000 toward the
project, the biggest single donation. In total, about $150,000 in
cash has been raised, including a $25,000 grant from the J.M. Long
Foundation, which was started by Joseph M. Long, the late co-founder
of Longs Drug Stores. Another $75,000 worth of plants has been
donated by local nurseries.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon said she believes the Pierce Foundation can raise the
remaining $200,000 needed to complete the garden.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Community College District is not contributing any
money, but has donated the land. Pierce College will pick up the
$30,000 annual tab for maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   The groundbreaking ceremony will begin at 10 a.m. Friday. The
garden will be built in two phases, with the first part scheduled to
open in September and the second by February, Solomon said.</TE>

<HD>Murder Indictment Dismissed, Suspect Is Rearrested</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutor wanted case against the Ventura woman
dropped after grand jury's selection process was found to be flawed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County judge Friday dismissed a murder indictment against
one of three suspects accused of participating in the October 1998
slaying of Ventura teenager Nichole Hendrix.</LD>
<LD>   Bridget Callahan, 30, of Ventura was rearrested moments after the
case was dismissed at the request of state prosecutors. She is
scheduled to be arraigned on murder charges next week.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Michael Katz sought the dismissal in light of a
recent court ruling that found the county's grand jury selection
process is flawed.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, Santa Barbara County Superior Court Judge Frank Ochoa
threw out a murder indictment after concluding that the 2000-01
Ventura County Grand Jury was composed of too many men and did not
reflect a fair cross-section of the community as required by law.</TE>
<TE>   Other defendants indicted by the same panel are now bringing
similar legal challenges, and Callahan's lawyer indicated plans to
join them.</TE>
<TE>   That prompted Katz to seek dismissal of the case to avoid
potentially time-consuming litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty obvious to me the defendant in this case was going
to bring a motion based on that decision," Katz said of Ochoa's
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Katz's request was granted by Ventura County Superior Court Judge
Vincent J. O'Neill Jr., who said: "I think it is a reasonable step
... to keep this case moving."</TE>
<TE>   The dismissal is the latest twist in Callahan's case, which has
been mired in controversy amid allegations that authorities used her
as an informant and months later indicted her on suspicion of
first-degree murder. Callahan's lawyer, Joseph O'Neill, contends she
was tricked by law enforcement after being promised immunity from
prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County district attorney's office denied the
allegations, then handed the case over to the state attorney
general's office last year to avoid an appearance of impropriety.</TE>
<TE>   A defense motion to dismiss the charges on grounds of prosecutor
misconduct was set for a hearing later this month but will now be
delayed as lawyers proceed with the preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan's lawyer suggested Friday that state prosecutors sought
the dismissal not because of Ochoa's ruling but to avoid an
embarrassing hearing on the misconduct issue.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, one of Callahan's co-defendants, David Ziesmer, has
filed a motion to have his indictment dismissed based on the ruling
from Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   And motions to dismiss indictments in the drug and racketeering
case against members of the Ventura Hells Angels chapter are
scheduled for a hearing on Monday.</TE>

<HD>California Not the Master of Disaster It's Reputed to Be</HD>
<DH>Study: Despite its quakes and wildfires, the state does not
rank in the top dozen in per capita dollar losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although California is widely known as a disaster-prone state, a new
study published by the National Academy of Sciences concludes that in
per capita dollar losses from all disasters, the state does not rank
in the top dozen.</LD>
<LD>   A book released this week, "American Hazardscapes," deals with
natural and technological disasters, ranging from earthquakes to
nuclear plant accidents. Its authors conclude that from 1975 to 1998
the Golden State, overall, ranked somewhere in the middle.</LD>
<LD>   California leads, as expected, in such categories as earthquakes
and wildfires, but it falls well behind in most others--hurricanes,
tornadoes, hailstorms, heat waves, cold waves and toxic releases.</LD>
<TE>   When population is taken into account, North Dakota ranks first in
disaster losses, with more than $10,000 per resident over the 23-year
period. California averaged less than $1,800 per person.</TE>
<TE>   The floods and general bad weather in the North Central states
also put South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa in the top dozen, and the
hurricanes and floods put the Gulf Coast states of Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and Florida in the top 12. Hawaii also was in
the top 12.</TE>
<TE>   In damages per square mile of territory, however, California did
nudge into the top 10 states.</TE>
<TE>   The book, edited by Susan Cutter, director of the Hazards Research
Laboratory at the University of South Carolina, finds that direct
losses in all American disasters in the years 1988 to 1998 averaged
$54 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   If all indirect as well as direct economic losses are taken into
account, the total reaches $160 billion a year. Average annual loss
of life was about 350.</TE>
<TE>   "California immediately comes to mind in both fictional and
nonfictional portrayals of a disaster prone-area," the authors note.</TE>
<TE>   And because it has the largest population in the country, damage
figures here are among the highest. But the picture changes on a per
capita basis, and more lives have traditionally been lost in
hurricanes and small events.</TE>
<TE>   Cutter said the thrust of the book is toward reducing
vulnerability through safer construction, land-use controls to avoid
dangerous areas and safer handling of hazardous materials.</TE>
<TE>   The authors also advocate limiting federal subsidies when
disasters do strike.</TE>
<TE>   California, however, may be going the other way. Since the
Northridge quake, the amount of earthquake insurance, in coverage for
losses and the number of those insured, has fallen so sharply that a
disastrous quake would probably result in a greater demand for
federal relief.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 15% of the state's homeowners are now covered for
earthquakes, compared with 30% at the time of the Northridge quake.</TE>
<TE>   Cutter said she believes that not until there is a catastrophe
that overwhelms the government's capacity or desire to provide relief
will there be real progress toward the kinds of action her study
advocates.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, she added, it might take "an earthquake in Los
Angeles or San Francisco, or a hurricane in New Orleans" to really
change public attitudes.</TE>

<HD>Fairfax High Fired Up Over Unwelcome New Neighbor</HD>
<DH>Store: A smoke shop across from campus appears to be legal,
but protests are planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fairfax High School students and their parents fumed when they spied
the new store that opened for business Friday in front of their
campus.</LD>
<LD>   Across Melrose Avenue from the school's main entrance was a
1960s-style head shop stocked with water pipes, drug-themed T-shirts
and cigarettes.</LD>
<LD>   "This is disgusting. They're marketing to teens. We already have a
drug problem," said Kehiante McKinley, a 17-year-old senior who
stared in disbelief at the bright red "Smoke Shop" sign over the
storefront.</LD>
<TE>   "Isn't there a law that says something like that can't be within a
certain distance from a school?"</TE>
<TE>   There isn't, discovered school officials and parents who tried
without success to snuff out the shop before Friday's grand opening.</TE>
<TE>   For two weeks they had watched with dismay as workers stocked the
shop's glass display cabinets and clothing racks and decorated its
walls with such decals as: "Did Someone Say Marijuana?"</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to nip it in the bud, so to speak," said Heather Evans,
parental liaison at the 2,600-pupil high school. "But nobody could do
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Municipal officials said the operator of the new shop has the
proper business and tax permits.</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney's office was investigating Friday whether the
store also had a tobacco retail permit--required through the city's
2-year-old Tobacco Enforcement Program. The permit is part of a
registration system for retailers who sell tobacco products, and
helps officials enforce a law that requires cigarettes to be
displayed on racks and shelves that are not accessible to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Cartons of cigarettes in the Smoke Shop were stored behind a
counter at the rear of the small shop. Proprietor Tigran Nersesyan
was unapologetic about his merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't sell to people under 18. We have signs up," he said. "If
you see the sign, you won't come in."</TE>
<TE>   But Nersesyan bristled when asked about the water pipes--many of
which were ornate and priced as high as $99.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not drug paraphernalia. These are tobacco pipes," he
said. He terminated the conversation when questioned about the
marijuana references on wall decorations and on clothing displayed in
the shop.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm finished," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later, Evans delivered copies of petitions signed by
220 parents and Fairfax High teachers protesting the sale of drug
paraphernalia and apparel. Nersesyan directed her to the shop's back
room for a private meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him he's preying on our kids," Evans said later. "He said
he never knew there was a school across the street. I said he should
move to a different location. He said he's not moving unless we pay
him to move. I told him we don't even have money for books."</TE>
<TE>   Evans said parents plan to picket Nersesyan's shop.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents are upset and rightfully so. I'm a child of the '60s
myself, but it's not appropriate to have a head shop across the
street from a school," said Fairfax High Principal Heather Daims as
she surveyed her new neighbor Friday from the campus.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they will be watching the new shop too.</TE>
<TE>   No local law regulates such businesses near schools, although some
cities have zoning ordinances that restrict their location, said Nora
Manzanilla, administrative coordinator of the Los Angeles Tobacco
Enforcement Program. "The city attorney's office is very interested
in this."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Jack Weiss, who represents the Fairfax area, said
officials will study other cities' ordinances.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, it's just plain wrong for somebody to open a
store for products dealing with tobacco, at best, and drug usage, at
worst. It's very disappointing to those of us in the community who
want to see the areas around our schools made more conducive to
kids," Weiss said. "This is a step in the wrong direction."</TE>
<TE>   Tenth-graders Alexandra Luna and Jose Loza, both 16, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Luna said the shop is a slap at those who teach that smoking and
drug use is wrong. The school has its own share of troubles. You can
smell marijuana in the bathrooms between classes, Loza said.</TE>
<TE>   "Students addicted to weed will go there," he added. "It shouldn't
be in front of our school--in front of our face."</TE>

<HD>State Expects Tech Sector Losses to Hurt</HD>
<DH>Taxes: Fallout from the marked drop in personal income last
year will deplete the treasury, an official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's total personal income shrank 0.7% in the third quarter
of 2001, the first such decline in more than three decades, according
to data released Friday by the state Department of Finance.</LD>
<LD>   The drop underscored just how dependent California has become on
income from the technology sector and the performance of the stock
market. The major culprit, analysts said, was the loss of income from
employee stock options, which had fueled spectacular wealth creation
in recent years. In 2000, for example, personal income in California
grew at a 9.8% annual rate, as tech workers and other professionals
reaped fat bonuses and options tied to the performance of their
companies' shares.</LD>
<LD>   Workers armed with Wall Street winnings bought homes, cars and
other big-ticket goods during the tech-stoked bull market. By one
estimate, stock market gains boosted consumer spending in California
by at least $10 billion in 1999 alone.</LD>
<TE>   But what Wall Street giveth, it taketh away. Now the very same
forces that juiced California's economy during the tech boom are
sapping the incomes of many of its most highly compensated workers.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout can be seen in declines in retail sales as well as
lower median home prices in the Bay Area, where tech sector wealth
powered a run-up in property values. But the biggest loser is
undoubtedly the state treasury, inexorably linked to the ups and
downs of the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   In fiscal 2000, $17.7 billion--fully 25%--of the revenue flowing
into California's general fund came from taxes on capital gains,
stock options and bonus income. That figure was sliced nearly in half
in 2001 after the tech bubble burst, and it isn't likely to improve
much this year.</TE>
<TE>   It's a big reason why California is facing a budget shortfall
variously described as $14.5 billion to $17 billion, and why nearly
all residents are going to feel the squeeze on the state's coffers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're now dealing with the consequences of the collapse in the
tech sector," said Howard Roth, chief economist for the Department of
Finance. "We lost a huge amount of income between 2000 and 2001."</TE>
<TE>   Personal income is a key measure of how the state economy is
performing. It includes a variety of revenue streams flowing into
California households, including wages, bonuses, stock options,
rental income and government payments such as Social Security. The
figures do not include capital gains income, which is tracked
separately.</TE>
<TE>   Employee wages represent the lion's share of total personal
income. But in California and other states with large technology
sectors, option and bonus income has become an increasingly important
part of the mix as firms have linked compensation to their share
prices.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's data illustrated the impact of the tech and stock market
meltdown. Total personal income in the third quarter of 2001 was
$1.107 trillion on an annualized basis, down from $1.115 trillion
during the same period in 2000, due mainly to the plunge in option
and bonus income. Finance's Roth said that's the first year-over-year
quarterly drop since at least 1970.</TE>
<TE>   The personal income decline stands in marked contrast to recent
economic indicators that show the state and national economies on the
mend. California has held up relatively well compared to the rest of
the nation despite its tech doldrums, thanks to a robust housing
market in most areas of the state and employment diversity in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   But although many economists think the national recession is
probably over, California's budget woes are not. That's because the
state has come to rely on personal income taxes to fund nearly 60% of
its general fund. But the rising importance of capital gains and
stock option revenue in that mix has made the personal income tax an
extremely volatile revenue source.</TE>
<TE>   California isn't alone in its increasing reliance on the stock
market. The Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany,
N.Y., has identified 14 other states, including technology hotbeds
such as Oregon and Massachusetts, that have come to rely on capital
gains income for a higher-than-average share of their general
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The formula is politically popular because it hits only the
wealthiest workers, said Nicholas W. Jenny, senior policy analyst
with the Rockefeller Institute. And he noted that it proved
incredibly lucrative for California and other states when the bull
market was in full swing.</TE>
<TE>   "The downside is that when you hit a recession, it can go away
astonishingly quickly," Jenny said. "Huge deficits can open up fast.
We're seeing that in California more than any other state right now."</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: capital gains. After raking in a record $10.6
billion in taxes from capital gains in 2000, California is expected
to see that revenue plunge by 45% to $5.9 billion for 2001 after
Californians file their returns in April, according to Department of
Finance projections.</TE>
<TE>   That has state officials scrambling to slash spending and come up
with other solutions to plug immediate holes in California's
$100-billion budget. But economy watchers say the shortfall
highlights a longer-term structural problem with California's tax
base, which has come to rely on large, highly volatile contributions
from a small group of workers.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report from the legislative analyst's office system
calculated that the top 5% of California taxpayers were liable for a
68% share of the personal income tax in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are a government, you want a tax base that's stable and
spread across a broad group of people," said Ted Gibson, formerly the
state's chief economist and now a senior economic advisor for
Metropolitan West. "California has neither."</TE>
<TE>   Department of Finance economist Roth is projecting that
California's total personal income will move higher in 2002 now that
the stock market has stabilized and the economy continues to
strengthen.</TE>
<TE>   But he and others say the drop in personal income and subsequent
budget woes are a reminder that California's heavy dependence on high
tech has its hazards.</TE>
<TE>   "Long-term it's a strength," said Tom Lieser, senior economist
with the UCLA Anderson Forecast. "But if you live by the stock
market, you perish by the stock market" when times get tough.</TE>

<CX>   State revenues--A headline on a story about technology sector
losses in Saturday's California section inaccurately characterized a
state official's comments about the effect of declining personal incomes
on state revenues. Although Howard L. Roth, chief economist for the state
Department of Finance, said the drop in stock option income has led to a
decline in total personal income, he didn't say the Treasury would be
"depleted."</CX>

<LD>College honors student Helen Mo was sentenced Friday to life in
prison without parole for the murder of a former boyfriend whose
burned body was dumped in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Helen Mo, 20, was in her first year at Rio Hondo College in
Whittier when she and three other people were arrested in the January
2000 slaying of fellow student Yichen Liu. Prosecutors said Mo feared
Liu would turn her in for stealing his jewelry. His burned body was
found in the trunk of his car.</LD>
<LD>   Mo was sentenced after being convicted last year of one count of
first-degree murder and one count of lying in wait.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said she had dated Liu for a brief time and feared he
would turn her in for stealing two bracelets, a necklace and credit
card. She had two previous burglary convictions and faced a
three-strikes sentence of 25 years to life if convicted again.</TE>
<TE>   "She planned to have him murdered so that she would not have to go
to jail," Deputy Dist. Atty. Deborah Lloyd said.</TE>
<TE>   After Liu discovered the theft, he went to Mo's home, authorities
said. He was beaten and stabbed by Mo's new boyfriend and two of his
friends, prosecutors said, then stuffed in the trunk of his car,
which was driven to a remote area and set on fire.</TE>
<TE>   Mo testified during the trial that she did not know the others
intended to kill Liu. She also said that when she was 17, a boyfriend
began committing crimes for thrills and lured her into the lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Li Da Liang, 19, and Sonny Joshua Wong, 24, are awaiting trial on
murder charges later this year. Lim Cheng, 24, is expected to be
retried after a jury deadlocked last year.</TE>
<TE>   Mo was a management student when Liu was killed. He was taking
business classes.</TE>
<TE>   Liu came to the United States in 1998 to study and help his
Taiwanese parents run an import business. He tutored Mo in math
before they became romantically involved.</TE>

<HD>'Bates Motel' Could Lose Permit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Its real name is the Sunset Pacific Motel, but many Silver Lake
residents know it as the Bates Motel.</LD>
<LD>   One reason is that the motel is at Bates Avenue and Sunset
Boulevard. The other reason is that neighbors say the place is
creepy, even if not in exactly the same way as the motel in the
Alfred Hitchcock thriller "Psycho."</LD>
<LD>   Around Sunset Pacific, the stench of urine is everywhere. Drug
dealing is rampant, police say, prostitutes are easy to find and
gunshots are common.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles police describe the three-story, 37-room building at
4301 Sunset Blvd. as one of the city's most dangerous properties.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, a nursery school faces the building on
Bates Avenue, and there is a middle school about a block away on
Fountain Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood residents have been trying to get city officials to
shut down the place for about 20 years. Next week, the City Council
is scheduled to consider whether to revoke the owner's operating
license.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a point where you stop calling the police," said Carlos
Lopez, who has lived in a house directly behind the motel since 1987.
"I'm very afraid."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez was among several residents who said they often find
hypodermic needles and condoms discarded in the area.</TE>
<TE>   But the motel's owner, Edward Eng, denies that anything improper
happens there. He contends that the Los Angeles Police Department
pays homeless people to linger around to make him look bad.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm telling you this is a frame-up," said Eng, who lives in Los
Feliz. "The people standing in the stairwell, they're not selling
drugs, they're just standing there."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Eng, who is a lawyer and an accountant, faces legal
pressure to clean up the building even as the city takes steps to
shut it down.</TE>
<TE>   After inspections by the city attorney's slum housing task force,
Eng was charged in December 2000 with more than two dozen housing
code violations at the motel.</TE>
<TE>   In June, he pleaded no contest to 10 of those charges, including
having unsanitary bathrooms, failing to maintain toilets, plumbing
and electrical services, and not having smoke detectors. Eng was
placed on probation and ordered to bring the property into compliance
with city and county building codes.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, a Superior Court judge gave Eng until Oct. 18 to
make the repairs. He did not meet the deadline, which resulted in his
probation being revoked and his being ordered to appear in court Feb.
13.</TE>
<TE>   The repairs still had not been made by then, which resulted in
Judge Laurie Zelon chastising Eng.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't think you had any intention to finish the work,"
Zelon told him.</TE>
<TE>   She then gave him an additional week to show proof that he had
taken steps to get the repairs done. On Feb. 20, Eng told the judge
that he had hired a contractor.</TE>
<TE>   Zelon gave him until March 28 to fix the property and warned that
if anything was left undone, he could face 300 days in jail. She went
ahead and fined him $8,100.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in December, the city zoning administrator's office
decided to recommend that the Department of Building and Safety
revoke the motel's operating license.</TE>
<TE>   Eng appealed that decision to the City Council's Planning and Land
Use Management Committee, which denied his appeal earlier this week.
Now the matter is scheduled to go before the full council Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti, whose district includes the motel, said
the process has been frustrating. He wants the motel closed down.
"This is one of the most troublesome properties in the city," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Many who live and work in the neighborhood feel the same way.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Shavit, nursery school director at Silver Lake-Los Feliz
Jewish Community Center across from the motel, said staff members,
parents and children are constantly on the lookout for dangerous
situations.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to walk a very tight rope for our own security," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Rodriguez, whose daughter attends nearby Thomas Starr King
Middle School, said the motel's presence discourages parents from
sending their children there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a matter of time before something bad is going to
happen to one of the students because of the criminal elements always
surrounding that place," she said.</TE>
<TE>   School officials advise students to walk on the opposite side of
the street from the motel.</TE>
<TE>   For Rebecca Acuna, who moved to the area in the 1960s, the
conditions are disappointing. She remembers when the motel was
well-maintained and even had a pool, which has since been cemented
over.</TE>
<TE>   Families from out of state stayed there, she said. When nearby
residents had no room in their homes for guests, they would direct
them to the motel.</TE>
<TE>   "You could walk by there and nobody bothered you," Acuna said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Officer Al Polehonki said that image is difficult to imagine
now.</TE>
<TE>   "The place looks bad, it's dirty, the rooms are filthy--you're not
going to get a lot of tourists going there," he said. "I think that
if the owner and his family had to live next to that motel, a lot of
changes would be made."</TE>
<TE>   Eng, who said he has owned the motel since the mid-1960s and
previously enjoyed a busy flow of vacationing tourists, said he is
ready to get rid of the property. It is in escrow, with buyers
Balubhai and Sardaben Patel willing to pay $1.5 million for it.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Patel, a spokesman for the potential buyers, said they are
frustrated that Eng has done little to improve the property.</TE>
<TE>   If they purchase the building, he said, they plan to shut it down
for 60 days and convert it into a national motel franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a monumental challenge for us," Patel said. "Nobody wants
that motel there."</TE>

<HD>Back-Seat Feeder Keeps Front-Seat Driver Well-Fed for
Rigors of Commute</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just when I thought I'd heard of every type of Stupid Driving Trick,
Deborah Schaeffer of Rancho Palos Verdes wrote me about a guy in a
minivan who "was being spoon-fed" by a woman in the back seat as he
navigated a transition road off the Long Beach Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   She noticed the driver seemed to be having some trouble keeping
his food on the spoon--and his vehicle on the road.</LD>
<LD>   Schaeffer guessed that the feeder was the guy's wife, adding: "I
don't think a girlfriend would do this." Having been married for 14
years, I have my doubts about the wife theory.</LD>
<TE>   "Maybe it was his mom," Schaeffer said.</TE>
<TE>   Stupid Driving, Part II: Schaeffer, who's obviously had a wild
month on the roads, also found herself behind another minivan driver
who sat at a "very long light playing his harmonica. He proceeded to
play away as he made a long left turn and was still rocking out when
he stopped to take another left."</TE>
<TE>   She added: "I was impressed--and very pleased that he was in front
of me."</TE>
<TE>   And that's the end of today's spoons-and-tunes traffic report.</TE>
<TE>   Saving on suds: "Am I a thrifty shopper or what?" wrote Bill
Wagner of Summerland, who got an unbelievable deal on some very
expensive beer (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Will the Riordan jinx strike again? Defeated candidate Richard
Riordan has thrown his support to his rival, Republican nominee Bill
Simon, in the gubernatorial race. But is that good news for Simon?
Riordan, you'll recall, endorsed Steve Soboroff, a loser in the
mayoral primary last year, then switched his support to Antonio
Villaraigosa, who lost in the mayoral general election.</TE>
<TE>   Read the small print: Jeff Marcia of Pomona noticed that a lumber
seller offered a delivery deal that would seem to apply only to its
next-door neighbor (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Easy for them to say: Mitchell Loch of L.A. found a sign that was
in need of an interpreter (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Looking down in the mouth: The L.A. Independent police log
reported that a man was arrested after shoplifting "$47 in dental
care products--whitening toothpaste, breath mints, tooth polish, a
toothbrush and dental care gum."</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if the guy's defense will be that he had just received a
very stern lecture from a dental hygienist?</TE>
<TE>   It's a myth that Angelenos panic over a little rain: After all,
the Channel 9 weathercaster managed to stay very calm the other night
as she stood in front of a huge graphic that said "Storm Watch."</TE>
<TE>   Nor did she lose her composure when she stared into the camera and
revealed the alarming news that the storm that day had dumped
"between one-tenth and one-hundredth of an inch" of rain around the
city.</TE>
<TE>   All the nudes, all the time: Christopher Thell of USC wrote in the
Daily Trojan newspaper about NakedNews.com, a Toronto, Canada, pay
service in which anchors read the news while disrobing.</TE>
<TE>   Asked for a comment, USC journalism professor Joe Saltzman
quipped: "When you get right down to it, I'd much rather watch a
NakedNews.com anchor read the news than Paul Moyer."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: What does Moyer of KNBC-TV (Channel 4) have in common
with the late Ted Knight, the actor who portrayed buffoonish news
anchor Ted Baxter on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show"?</TE>
<TE>   Both Moyer and Knight served as honorary mayors of Pacific
Palisades.</TE>

<HD>Woman, 75, Takes Hikes All in Stride</HD>
<DH>The sprightly senior outpaces people half her age as she
leads Sierra Club conditioning walks three times a week up O.C.'s
mountain trails.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's 7:40 a.m. on a foggy Sunday. Mountain bikers dressed in Day-Glo
plumage are gearing up in the parking lot at Orange County's Whiting
Ranch Wilderness Park in the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   Nearby, a slight, gray-haired woman stands quietly beside a kiosk
where trail maps are posted.</LD>
<LD>   At 8 a.m. on the dot, she checks her watch and sets off. Striding
smartly up the hill, she picks up speed. Behind her, a dozen younger
hikers struggle to keep up. Some break into a jog.</LD>
<TE>   "It's kind of shocking how fast she can go," says David
McCullough, 35, of Mission Viejo, clutching a bottle of Gatorade and
gamely trying to keep pace.</TE>
<TE>   She is Debbie Jacobowitz, 75, the no-nonsense leader of the Sierra
Club's Sierra Sage group conditioning hikes. Three times a week,
Jacobowitz whizzes up trails from Laguna Beach to the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "She's incredible," says Sid Greenbaum, 56, of Dana Point, who
first hiked with Jacobowitz three years ago when he was training for
a mountain trek in Nepal. He jokes that he's still tired--from the
hikes with her.</TE>
<TE>   "I only hope when I'm her age I can do it too," he says, echoing
the sentiments of most hikers who follow in her wake.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobowitz, who clearly loves being in the lead, is modest about
her skills.</TE>
<TE>   "People want a good workout, and I try to give them that," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Today's jaunt is an eight-mile, two-hour-plus power walk that
leads first to a local geologic wonder known as the Red Rocks. From
there, it's onto the fittingly named Billy Goat Trail, a narrow wisp
that hugs a ridgeline between the mountains and the Aliso Creek
headwaters.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, you get a peak at the houses massed on the
ridgelines of the Portola Hills development. But for long stretches
of time, the countryside appears much as it might have a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Today's hiking crowd includes schoolteachers and engineers, a
Xerox services manager, a retired father and his grown daughter, and
Jady Enomoto, a young woman with a pierced tongue.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people my age like extreme sports or going to the clubs,"
says Enomoto, 23, of Garden Grove. "I come from an outdoorsy,
athletic family."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobowitz didn't begin hiking until 1990, at age 63. A New York
City public school music teacher, she moved to California from
Brooklyn that year to help with a son's children.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved it. I thought, 'Oh, Southern California is the place for
me,' because everyone here likes to exercise," she says. "I've always
loved to exercise, but back there I was an oddball."</TE>
<TE>   A gentleman neighbor at the Leisure World senior community in
Laguna Woods took her hiking at Mt. Wilson. Jacobowitz fell in love
with hiking.</TE>
<TE>   Within a year, she was leading treks. Sierra Club hike leaders
train for several days, and must know CPR and other emergency medical
training. Jacobowitz has also learned how to avoid trouble on the
trail. Instead of checking faces when would-be hikers show up, she
inspects their shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "If they don't have good lug soles, I really advise against them
coming," she says.</TE>
<TE>   But she has learned not to judge every book by its cover. When a
very large hiker showed up one week, she urged him to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   "He smirked," she recalled sheepishly. "He beat me up the
mountain."</TE>
<TE>   One man who did not tell a leader he had a preexisting medical
condition died of a heart attack on an Orange County Sierra Club hike
about a year ago, Jacobowitz says. Now, everyone must sign a waiver
before setting out.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobowitz, a vegetarian who says she hasn't been sick in several
years, believes that people with health problems have a
responsibility to tell hike leaders beforehand. She has never lost
anybody, but one man with epilepsy suffered a seizure atop a peak in
Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "He scared the other hikers terribly," Jacobowitz says. "He should
have told me he was epileptic."</TE>
<TE>   Despite, or because of, her plain-spoken manner, Jacobowitz has
the respect of fellow hikers, though it's her stamina that people
tend to talk about.</TE>
<TE>   "We all have high regard for her physical capability," says Chet
Stipe, outings chairman for the Sierra Sage group. "Sunday morning,
well, it's quite a workout. Last time I went with her, we got to the
top, and she made everybody stop and do exercises."</TE>
<TE>   Today is no different. As hikers pant and puff to the top of the
ridge, Jacobowitz gathers them under what is now a blazing sun in a
bright blue sky for a quick round of stretches.</TE>
<TE>   She appears almost puzzled by people who find the going difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "There he is. Tell him to come up here!" she says from the crest,
looking back down at a straggler.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he would if he could, mom," says her son, Lee Jacobi, who
has shortened his family name. He leads hikes himself but says his
mother's are tougher.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobowitz's mother, a native of Finland, made her spend an hour
outdoors every day as a child, even on the coldest days. She spent
much of the time walking, but never hiked.</TE>
<TE>   Cold weather is still her nemesis. Jacobowitz grew so chilled on a
strenuous climb up San Gorgonio Peak a few years ago that the trip
leader threw an emergency blanket around her and forced her to rest.</TE>
<TE>   Short of that, not much stops her.</TE>
<TE>   She wakes at 2:30 a.m., does two hours of ballet,  heads to the
gym at 4 a.m. for several hours of yoga and weightlifting. She is
annoyed that she has shrunk an inch and a half from mild
osteoporosis. She stands 5 feet, 3 inches and weighs 100 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   On the trail, conversation varies with age groups. As the hikers
enter a cool, shady glade of trees, older members discuss the
potential risks of potato sugar for diabetics, while the 23-year-old
talks about piercings and tattoos.</TE>
<TE>   But everyone delights in the mammoth live oaks, the native grasses
and wildflowers, and shake their fists at the development that
occasionally clutters a view.</TE>
<TE>   "I always feel like I've been on vacation for a week," Jacobowitz
says as the dull roar of traffic can suddenly be heard through the
green woods.</TE>
<TE>   The hike winds down along several busy blocks of Portola Parkway
and ends at the parking lot where it began. It's hard to believe
there are clear creeks and meadows a few hundred yards away.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to hike for another 30 years," Jacobowitz says. "It's
not just living a long time that's important, it's the quality of
that life."</TE>

<HD>Al Pollard, 73; Prep Star Played for Army, Eagles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAL FLORENCE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Al Pollard, one of Southern California's most renowned prep football
players, who went on to play for the legendary Vince Lombardi at Army
and later played in the National Football League, has died. He was
73.</LD>
<LD>   Pollard died Sunday of lymphoma at his home in the Philadelphia
suburb of Devon.</LD>
<LD>   He was a star T-formation halfback at Loyola High School, scoring
23 touchdowns his senior year. He was also an exceptional passer,
punter and kick returner, as well as a fine defensive player.</LD>
<TE>   Paul Zimmerman, a former Times sports editor, wrote that Pollard
was "the most widely sought prep star since Glenn Davis left Bonita
High and went to Army."</TE>
<TE>   After playing briefly at Loyola University in Los Angeles, Pollard
left in 1949 for West Point, where he played under Lombardi, then
Army's backfield coach.</TE>
<TE>   After a 1950 season in which Pollard led Army in scoring and
averaged 7.3 yards per carry, he was among 90 cadets--including the
son of head Coach Red Blaik--who resigned from the academy in
connection with a cribbing scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard then signed with the New York Yanks of the National
Football League. After the Yanks waived him in November 1951, he was
claimed by the Philadelphia Eagles and played for them from 1951 to
1953.</TE>
<TE>   He later played for the British Columbia Lions and the Calgary
Stampeders of the Canadian Football League.</TE>
<TE>   While in Canada, Pollard became involved in several business
ventures, operating a restaurant and a beverage distributorship.</TE>

commercial printing business.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Roy Porter, a writer and historian who attracted an international
readership, has died. He was 55.</LD>
<LD>   Porter, author of an acclaimed history of London and several other

short time later. His death is under investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Porter had recently retired from the Wellcome Trust Centre for the
History of Medicine at University College London.</LD>
<TE>   "Professor Porter was a great historian who brought history to the
people. His sudden death is a tragic loss, specially as he still had
so much he wanted to achieve," said Mike Dexter, director of the
Wellcome Trust.</TE>
<TE>   A respected academic, Porter also was known through television and
radio appearances, newspaper articles and his books, which ranged
from "Gout: the Patrician Malady" to "Health for Sale: Quackery in
England 1650-1850."</TE>
<TE>   One of his best-known works was "The Greatest Benefit to Mankind:
A Medical History of Humanity," published in 1997. It received a
number of prizes, including a Los Angeles Times Book Prize in the
history category.</TE>
<TE>   Another, his "London: A Social History," in 1994, covered 2,000
years in the life of the city and its people, and won wide praise.</TE>
<TE>   He has been a visiting professor at UCLA, Princeton University and
Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   Porter was married and divorced three times.</TE>

<HD>Former Coach at Thousand Oaks High Accused of Having Sex
With 2 Students</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Jeffrey Magruder, 24, is arrested outside
his home. It's the third such case against a county teacher or coach
since February.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Thousand Oaks High School wrestling coach was arrested
Friday morning and charged with having sex with students when he
worked at the school.</LD>
<LD>   It is the third arrest of a Ventura County teacher or coach for
allegedly having sex with students since February.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey S. Magruder, 24, was taken into custody outside his
Thousand Oaks home. He is alleged to have had sex with two underage
girls at his home after giving them alcohol, but the investigation is
continuing, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Magruder quit his coaching job at Thousand Oaks High School almost
two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   He has been head wrestling coach at Newbury Park High School since
then, said Chuck Eklund, director of secondary education for the
Conejo Valley Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a walk-on coach and not a member of the faculty or regular
staff," Eklund said. Walk-on coaches work only during the athletic
season.</TE>
<TE>   Eklund would not say if there were any complaints against Magruder
at Newbury Park.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives began investigating Magruder in January after a tip
from a school employee.</TE>
<TE>   "The report we got was that he would invite students to his house
and give them alcohol, then get involved sexually with them,"
sheriff's spokesman Eric Nishimoto said.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now we have two victims under 18 and no indications of
additional students," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This is the latest in a string of recent arrests involving
teachers or coaches and minors.</TE>
<TE>   In early February, Camarillo High School science teacher Chad
Wenzlick Pridgen, 30, was arrested on 33 felony and misdemeanor
counts that included trying to seduce and have sexual relations with
underage male students.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, Andrew Paul Fonseca, a volunteer wrestling coach
at Moorpark High School, was arrested on suspicion of having sex with
a 14-year-old female student.</TE>
<TE>   Eklund said Magruder had passed all his criminal background
checks.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to comment further on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Magruder also worked as an exterminator for a company in Newbury
Park.</TE>
<TE>   He faces four charges, including unlawful intercourse with a minor
and using alcohol to commit rape.</TE>
<TE>   Magruder was being held in Ventura County Jail on $100,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>John Riddle Jr., 68; Artist and Curator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Thomas Riddle Jr., a sculptor, painter and printmaker known for
artworks that addressed the struggles of black Americans through
history, has died. He was 68.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles resident suffered a heart attack while visiting
family in Atlanta last Thanksgiving. He died Sunday of complications
of the heart attack at an Atlanta hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Riddle, who also was a curator at the California African American
Museum in Exposition Park, was a figurative artist early in his
career but changed his ideas about "what the purpose of art should
be" after the Watts riots in 1965.</LD>
<TE>   He began to concentrate on themes that explored the harsh
realities of life in South-Central Los Angeles, creating pieces from
welded steel and debris left by the riots.</TE>
<TE>   One such piece, titled "The Ghetto Merchant," was made out of a
cash register he rescued from a burned-out Watts store. It was
featured in an exhibit called "19 Sixties, A Cultural Awakening
Re-Evaluated, 1965-1975" at the California Afro-American Museum in
Los Angeles in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Later works often contained references to famous African
Americans, from Sojourner Truth to Dizzy Gillespie, and drew on
African and American folk myths.</TE>
<TE>   "He saw art as a way of educating African Americans about their
history and how they got here," said Drew Talley, collection manager
at the California African American Museum. "He especially wanted to
educate the youths so that they wouldn't forget."</TE>
<TE>   Riddle's public commissions include a bronze statue on the grounds
of the Georgia Capitol called "Expelled Because of Color." Other
works are in the collections of the Oakland Museum, the California
African American Museum, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta and the
Harriet Tubman Museum in Macon, Ga. His work also has been collected
by celebrities such as Bill Cosby and Cicely Tyson and frequently
appeared on the NBC television drama "In the Heat of the Night."</TE>
<TE>   Riddle taught art at Los Angeles High School and Beverly Hills
High School in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1974 he moved to
Atlanta, where he taught at Spelman College, directed the city's
Neighborhood Art Center and worked for the Bureau of Cultural
Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the California African American Museum in 1999 as
curator of visual arts. He had been in the midst of organizing
several shows, including one on the work of South African
photographer Peter Magubene, when he was incapacitated by the heart
attack in November.</TE>
<TE>   Riddle was born and raised in Los Angeles. His father, John Riddle
Sr., was a former USC fullback who was believed to be the first black
to play in a Rose Bowl game, in 1923. His mother, the former Helen
Louise Wheeler, was believed to be the first black woman to graduate
from USC's law school.</TE>
<TE>   Riddle joined the Air Force in 1953 and served four years. He
attended night school on the GI Bill for nine years, eventually
earning a bachelor's degree in education and a master's degree in art
at Cal State L.A.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of nearly 50 years, Carmen Willa
Garrott Riddle; daughters Shawn Henderson of West Palm Beach, Fla.,
Deborah Riddle of Los Angeles, Pamela Kilpatrick of Doraville, Ga.,
and Spring Foster of Snellville, Ga.; sons Anthony, of New York, and
Diallo, of Los Angeles; sisters Joanne Jefferson and Judy Kealing,
both of Los Angeles; a brother, Paul, of Los Angeles; and 12
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Donations in his memory may be sent to the Los Angeles High School
Arts Scholarship Fund, c/o Mrs. Atkins, 4650 W. Olympic Blvd., Los
Angeles, CA 90019.</TE>
<TE>   A celebration of his life will be held from 2 to 4 p.m. April 7 at
the Watts Towers Art Center in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>3 Teen Brothers Arrested in Slaying</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three teenage brothers have been arrested in the beating death of an
81-year-old woman who Southeast Los Angeles neighbors described as
beloved, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The boys--ages 13, 14 and 15--were taken into custody early
Thursday at their home in the 10000 block of South Anzac Avenue, not
far from where Ruby Scott's body was found Aug. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The boys, whose names were not released because they are minors,
are expected to be arraigned next week on suspicion of murder and
burglary, said LAPD homicide Det. John Zambos.</LD>
<TE>   Neighbors described Scott, who lived alone, as a sweet woman with
a penchant for sweeping a large stretch of sidewalk in her
neighborhood of 40 years. She swept so long and far that residents
and employees at a nearby day-care center would gently prod her back
home.</TE>
<TE>   "She was an honest, independent, God-fearing lady, and she was
very hard-working," said neighbor Henry Scott, 70, who was not
related to her.</TE>
<TE>   She also stood up to gang members and people up to no good, Henry
Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone was up to something, she'd say, 'Whatever you're
looking for, you can't find in this harm you're doing. You need to
find the Lord,'" he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   But Ruby Scott increasingly feared boys who hung around a vacant
house next door. Neighbors said a group of boys, including the
brothers, would taunt Scott, who was losing her hearing. They would
also toss trash from her bins on her frontyard, smoke pot, vandalize
property and jump on the roofs of neighborhood homes.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers' father said he does not believe his children are
capable of murder. The 58-year-old said his boys could be
troublemakers, but they "respect their elders."</TE>
<TE>   He said that after his 13-year-old son was temporarily taken into
custody several months ago, he confronted him.</TE>
<TE>   "'Did you do this?' I asked him," he said. "He said, 'No, how
could you think that?'"</TE>
<TE>   But Zambos said he's confident police have Ruby Scott's killers.
"Old-fashioned police work" on the streets and some physical evidence
led to the arrests, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott may have caught the boys in the act of burglarizing her
home, Zambos said. Henry Scott found her body amid broken glass in
her home several days after her death.</TE>
<TE>   "She once said, 'Mr. Henry, if you ever hear me hollering, don't
forget to come and see about me,'" Henry Scott said Friday. "I think
she had a premonition."</TE>

<HD>Vote Tally Drags Out in Race for Head of SAG</HD>
<DH>Labor: Many members fear that it will take years to heal
from bitter fight regardless of who is elected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bitter election for president of the Screen Actors Guild remained
in doubt early this morning as a record turnout dragged Friday's vote
count past midnight.</LD>
<LD>   At stake is the post that actress Melissa Gilbert won in November
from fellow 1970s TV star Valerie Harper, but was forced to seek
again. A SAG committee overturned the results in January, citing
election irregularities.</LD>
<LD>   The union said that 41.1%, or 37,742, of the 91,054 members whose
dues are paid, cast votes in the mail-in election. Two other offices,
the treasurer's post held by actor Kent McCord and the office of
recording secretary held by Elliott Gould, also were rerun. Results
were expected to be revealed Friday evening, but the announcement was
repeatedly rescheduled.</LD>
<TE>   The election to the two-year term has been one of the nastiest
battles in the history of Hollywood unions, marked by accusations and
name-calling involving some of the industry's best-known actors. At
one point, Gould, a Harper supporter, called actor Mike Farrell, a
Gilbert partisan, "a slug" during a rally.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like this before and I've been around 30
years," said labor lawyer Alan Brunswick of the Los Angeles law firm
Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips. "No matter what decision is reached there
is going to be vitriol coming from the other side."</TE>
<TE>   Best known for playing Laura Ingalls in "Little House on the
Prairie," Gilbert has been serving as president of the 98,000-member
guild since November.</TE>
<TE>   In January, a SAG elections committee upheld a challenge from
Harper and others, who complained that the vote was tainted because
New York members were given two extra days to vote and ballot
envelopes contained no line for a signature.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert's supporters decried the decision as a coup attempt by a
committee packed with Harper supporters. Dubbing Harper and her
supporters as "the refuse to lose" group, her opponents argued that
the violations were inconsequential, followed past procedures and
that Gilbert would have won anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Harper and Gilbert represent two factions that have been at odds
for nearly three years.</TE>
<TE>   Best known for playing Rhoda Morgenstern on "The Mary Tyler Moore
Show" and its "Rhoda" spinoff, Harper vowed to carry on the
aggressive policies of former President William Daniels, who led SAG
on a six-month walkout against advertisers. Harper argued that the
strike, the longest in Hollywood history, was a success and
galvanized the union.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert and her supporters argued that the strike was a failure,
costing SAG members tens of millions of dollars in lost pay.</TE>
<TE>   A volunteer position, SAG's president is the most visible face in
Hollywood representing actors. Past presidents have included such
stars as Charlton Heston, Patty Duke, James Cagney and Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever wins will have the challenge of trying to heal a union
that many longtime SAG members believe is so bitterly divided that it
will be unwieldy to lead and will take years to unite.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get out of this cycle of acting like the Hatfields and
McCoys," said Oscar-nominated actress Tess Harper, who is not related
to Valerie Harper.</TE>
<TE>   Tess Harper also said she worries that the partisan attacks of the
past SAG elections will discourage good candidates from running.</TE>
<TE>   "You get no pay, no power and half the membership hates you the
day you are elected," she said.</TE>

<HD>Roadside Santa Claus Pulled Down From Roof of Candy Store</HD>
<DH>Landmark: The statue stood for 52 years--a long time as a
salute to motoring America but recently just a hazard too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARPINTERIA</DL>
<LD>To some, he was a cherished example of "roadside vernacular" art.</LD>
<LD>   To others, he was a perpetually smiling, red-suited hazard who had
outlived his time and his owner's patience.</LD>
<LD>   Either way, he's gone.</LD>
<TE>   At 5 a.m. Friday, a crane eased the 20-foot-high statue of Santa
off the roof of a candy shop from which he had waved a greeting at
generations of motoring Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "All day, people have been stopping and having their pictures
taken" with the 8,000-pound icon, said Bruce Meister of Becker
Construction in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Meister was hired to get rid of the figure, which had loomed over
U.S. 101 down the coast from Santa Barbara for 52 years.</TE>
<TE>   A reminder of an era of car vacations when modest commercial
Christmas villages sprang up on major highways around the country,
Santa had fallen into disrepair over time.</TE>
<TE>   The snowman character that once stood nearby was taken away 20
years ago, but Santa hung on. While the plaster and chicken wire
statue itself is fit enough, Meister said, the base where it was
attached to the roof had rotted.</TE>
<TE>   The former owner of the business inside, Santa's Candy Kitchen,
complained that the roof leaked when it rained. Mary Lou Dodson said
she was afraid St. Nick would one day come through the roof, not down
the chimney.</TE>
<TE>   The figure was once part of a Santa Claus Lane commercial strip,
but the owner, Dr. Steve Kent, said the Christmas theme had lost its
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a detraction, not an attraction," Kent said recently.</TE>
<TE>   Kent wanted to replace the North Pole theme with something modeled
on a seaside village.</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists fought to retain Santa as an example of roadside
Americana.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors broke
the stalemate and issued Kent a permit to remove the figure.</TE>
<TE>   Meister said the choice to remove it under cover of darkness was
not made out of fear that mobs of Santa loyalists would try to stop
him, but to avoid causing a disruption. It didn't completely work.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, six people are taking pictures of him on the ground,"
Meister said.</TE>
<TE>   The county's permit allows the statue to remain where it is until
January, when it can be demolished if no one comes forward to claim
it.</TE>
<TE>   One problem with moving it, Meister said, is that it might not fit
under freeway overpasses.</TE>
<TE>   Removing Santa from the roof may have solved one problem, but it
created another for Marybelle Rodriguez, the new operator of Santa's
Candy Kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll probably just cut 'Santa' off" the title "and call it
'Candy Kitchen,'" she said.</TE>
<TE>   How's Santa taking his fall off the roof? "He's still saluting,"
Rodriguez said, laughing.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With a preliminary hearing set for Monday, a judge issued a gag order
Friday on attorneys, police and other officials involved in the case
of David Westerfield, accused of kidnapping and murdering 7-year-old
Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   The order by Superior Court Judge H. Ronald Domnitz prohibits
defense and prosecution counsel and others from discussing the case.</LD>
<LD>   A gag order had been requested by Westerfield's attorney but
opposed by San Diego County Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst.</LD>
<TE>   Pfingst and San Diego Police Chief David Bejarano held news
conferences after Westerfield's arrest, and said DNA evidence linked
Westerfield to the killing.</TE>

<LD>A judge has placed an American Indian casino project in Ione on hold
until officials determine who leads the Buena Vista Rancheria of
Me-Wuk Indians.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Frank Damrell continued a January injunction
to allow the Bureau of Indian Affairs to determine if Donnamarie
Potts or Rhonda Morningstar Pope is the dozen-member tribe's leader.</LD>
<LD>   In December, the bureau ruled that Pope had the right to form a
tribal government after she questioned Potts' tribal lineal descent.
Potts filed an appeal and continued with the tribe's casino project.</LD>
<TE>   Pope said she doesn't want a casino on the Buena Vista Rancheria
because it is sacred ground.</TE>

<HD>Greuel Extends Lead in Race</HD>
<DH>Council: Candidate holds off declaring victory. Police bond
outcome still undecided.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Council candidate Wendy Greuel is all but assured
victory, her top advisors said Friday, after she extended her lead
over Tony Cardenas to 329 votes with 1,000 ballots left to be
counted.</LD>
<LD>   The count of ballots not tallied on election day also showed the
vote for Proposition Q, the city's $600-million police bond measure,
has edged up to 66.7%, just above the level needed for passage. But
with 5,000 to 7,000 votes uncounted, both sides said it was still too
close to call.</LD>
<LD>   In the 2nd District council race, election officials on Friday had
counted 2,030 absentee ballots, leaving about 1,000 absentee and
provisional ballots--those handed in at polling places by voters
whose names were not on the precinct's voter rolls.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's a virtual impossibility that anyone other than Wendy
Greuel will be the next council member," said Stephen Kaufman,
Greuel's campaign attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel, an executive with the entertainment firm DreamWorks SKG,
said she is confident she will prevail. But she held off declaring
victory Friday, saying she wants to see the tally Tuesday when most
of the remaining votes are expected to be counted.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just delighted and excited to see the lead increase," Greuel
said. "I am very confident my lead will hold."</TE>
<TE>   Although county officials have not pinpointed the number of
uncounted ballots that remain, Greuel campaign consultant John
Shallman estimated Cardenas would have to win 70% of them to move
into the lead. Fred Woocher, an attorney for Cardenas, put that
figure at 60%.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still hopeful," Woocher said. "I would not say optimistic
is the right word."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas is not conceding the election, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Woocher expected Greuel to gain some ground with Friday's count of
absentee ballots, because she won 58% of those mailed before election
day. But he was surprised by the size of the lead she built.</TE>
<TE>   "We had hoped to have done a little better," Woocher said. "We
think we can pick up a few hundred votes. Can we pick up that many? I
don't know."</TE>
<TE>   It is too early to write off the election, Woocher said. Also, he
said, there have been some allegations of irregularities, including
late poll openings, that could affect the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas has not ruled out asking for a recount if the final tally
is close.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said she continued to talk to community leaders in the east
San Fernando Valley district Friday as part of preparations to assume
office.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel and Cardenas spent a combined $1.7 million before Tuesday's
election for the seat, which was vacated when Joel Wachs resigned in
October to head an arts foundation in New York City. An election
night count of 26,393 votes had Greuel leading by 55 votes with about
3,000 absentee and provisional ballots left to be counted.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition Q received 66.61% of the votes counted on election
night, just short of the 66.66% needed for passage. On Friday, the
county registrar counted 19,184 absentee ballots, bringing the
measure 121 votes over the two-thirds vote threshold, Deputy City
Clerk Frank Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy Registrar-Recorder Kristin Heffron said there are
thousands of uncounted ballots for Los Angeles, perhaps 5,000 or
more.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very up in the air. It's too close to call," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Council President Alex Padilla, who headed the campaign favoring
the measure, said the latest tally was encouraging. But Richard
Close, chairman of Valley VOTE, who headed a group of secessionists
and taxpayer activists in opposing Proposition Q, called the tally
disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   The bond measure would provide $600 million for new police and
fire facilities, as well as replacement of the Hollenbeck, Harbor,
Rampart and West Valley police stations.</TE>

of Supervisors criminally violated state open meeting laws by
secretly voting to kill a proposed ballot measure.</LD>
<LD>   The district attorney's office has assigned a prosecutor to review
the complaint to determine whether an investigation is warranted.</LD>
<LD>   "We're hoping the district attorney's office will hold these
officials accountable," said Tyrone Freeman, president of Service
Employees International Union Local 434B. "No elected official is
above the law. We hope the district attorney's office will take the
proper steps to ensure that it never happens again."</LD>
<TE>   County Counsel Lloyd Pellman denies that he or the board violated
any open meeting laws.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors voted 4-1 in closed session on Dec. 18 to instruct
the county counsel to ignore his legal requirement to prepare a
ballot title and summary for an initiative to increase the aides'
salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the county registrar-recorder receives those documents, the
proponents cannot begin to gather signatures to qualify for the
November ballot, stopping the proposal in its tracks.</TE>
<TE>   The decision, opposed by Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, was not
reported to the public. The matter was revealed this week, through
county documents obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The union is complaining that the matter should have been
discussed in public.</TE>
<TE>   Pellman was the first to suggest to the board that he could kill
the measure by refusing to do the required work. He eventually
decided that would be illegal and called a majority of the
supervisors to discuss the issue.</TE>
<TE>   By making those calls without posting notice of a meeting, the
union and Supervisor Gloria Molina contend that he further violated
the open meeting law.</TE>
<TE>   Molina claims Pellman also violated the law because he did not
call her office before making the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Excuse me, this is not the way the system works,'"
Molina said in an interview. "In another instance that would be
called insubordination."</TE>
<TE>   "It was not only a [open meeting law] violation, but more
importantly, this is my lawyer," she added. "It's his responsibility
to make sure that we as supervisors are not violating the law."</TE>
<TE>   Molina said she consulted local and state prosecutors about what
to do about her colleagues' alleged violation of the open meeting
law, and that they told her she should ask the board to correct the
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   She said she then scheduled a series of follow-up closed session
meetings to discuss the violation and possible reprimands against
Pellman. She also dug into her office budget to briefly hire a lawyer
specializing in ethics to represent her in the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The final result was that the board last month passed written
rules for closed-session meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Molina said she voted in the Dec. 18 meeting to kill the
initiative after the board was advised by Pellman that it was a legal
option.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors are opposed to the measure because they believe it
would usurp their budgeting power and set a bad precedent for workers
asking voters for raises.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I supposed to just wait for all the unions to put all their
issues on the ballot and divvy up the budget?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said he cast the lone dissent in that December meeting
because he thought the county should not interfere with the
initiative process. "It's just wrong," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Molina said the matter has left her with a distrust of the
county's top lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there should have been a personnel action that this board
should have taken, and none was taken," Molina said. "I have to make
decisions based on legal advice that's given to me.''  If the
supervisors are found guilty of violating the open meeting law, they
could be held criminally liable for a misdemeanor, which carries
penalties of up to six months in jail or $1,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal charges have never before been brought for violation of
open meeting laws in California, said Dave Demerjian, head deputy
district attorney over the Public Integrity Division.</TE>
<TE>   Since the unit was established by Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley,
several elected bodies have been investigated and accused of
violations. Ultimately, those cases were resolved without prosecution
when the accused officials corrected the actions, Demerjian said.</TE>

<HD>Brochure on Sex Abuse Being Sent to Roman Catholic Schools,
Parishes</HD>
<DH>Priests: Responding to concern over scandals, L.A.'s
Cardinal Mahony distributes information on the church's policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prompted by a national outcry over priestly sex abuse, Cardinal Roger
M. Mahony has ordered that an informational brochure on the problem
be sent to all parishes and schools in the Los Angeles Archdiocese.</LD>
<LD>   The brochure, "Respecting the Boundaries: Keeping Ministerial
Relationships Healthy and Holy," was first posted on the
archdiocese's Web site in August. The Roman Catholic Church
newspaper, the Tidings, reprinted it on its front page this week.</LD>
<LD>   Archdiocese spokesman Tod Tamberg said the cardinal decided to
widely distribute the brochure because of the surge of attention on
sex scandals involving Roman Catholic clergy that erupted in January
with the criminal trial of a Boston priest accused of molesting 130
children.</LD>
<TE>   "Cardinal Mahony thought ... it was important for him to reiterate
to the Catholic faithful that we have comprehensive policies on sex
abuse, that we follow them carefully and review them regularly,"
Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The brochure is written in a question-and-answer format, answering
such questions as the nature of sexual abuse; factors that might lead
to it; how to prevent it; and how the archdiocese handles complaints
against clergy.</TE>
<TE>   It defines sexual abuse as behavior that can range from
intercourse to an "inappropriate gift," such as lingerie, or a
prolonged hug when a brief one would be appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   The brochure says the archdiocese will respond to all allegations
of abuse promptly with a team of investigators; comply with laws
requiring that alleged abuse be brought to the attention of law
enforcement agencies; offer psychological and spiritual counseling to
families and victims; and seek to "deal as openly as possible" with
the parish community over the charges.</TE>
<TE>   The brochure lists the archdiocese's sexual abuse hotline, (800)
355-2545.</TE>
<TE>   The brochure and hotline are two of 11 items that were required of
the Los Angeles and Orange archdioceses in settling a $5.2-million
lawsuit over sexual molestation charges involving an Orange County
priest and one of his high school students last year.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement also required the church to remove any employee
found guilty of sexual abuse. That shift toward zero tolerance was
reflected in Mahony's Feb. 22 pastoral statement vowing that any
priest or deacon found to have abused a minor "will never return to
active ministry" and would be urged to leave clerical status
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier policy, adopted by the archdiocese in 1988, allowed the
possibility of treating the guilty party and eventually returning him
to ministry.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese, with 5 million members and 292 parishes, says it
has received six child molestation complaints in the last five years.
Diocesan attorney John P. McNicholas said two of those are current,
and the others involved adults alleging past misconduct.</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Simon Attacks Davis Over Fiscal Woes</HD>
<DH>Politics: The incumbent ignored state's problems while
focusing on raising funds for reelection, the GOP challenger says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr. charged Friday that
Gov. Gray Davis failed to anticipate the state's fiscal troubles
because he was too busy raising money for his reelection campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Simon attacked his Democratic opponent's ethics at a luncheon of
agricultural leaders. By ignoring the state's energy and fiscal
problems, Simon told them, Davis left the budget "totally out of
control" with a $17-billion shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   If the governor had talked to farmers, Silicon Valley engineers or
Southern California home builders, Simon said, he would have known
the economy would slow down and state revenues would drop.</LD>
<TE>   "But he didn't," Simon said. "He was too busy raising money. The
only deficit he was trying to fill was the one in his campaign
account."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Davis and lawmakers have trimmed about $3 billion from an
estimated $17.5-billion deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Davis reelection strategist Garry South responded to Simon's
charges by belittling the Republican nominee, whose lack of
experience in government has been a key focus of the governor's
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike rich kid Billy Simon, who inherited fantastic wealth from
his father, Gray Davis doesn't have his own personal money that he
can put into his campaign," South said. "He has to raise it."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, a Pacific Palisades businessman, put $5 million of his
personal fortune into his campaign for the GOP nomination. He said
Friday that he expects his general election campaign to cost $30
million to $40 million, but declined to say how much of his own money
he would spend.</TE>
<TE>   By attacking the governor's fund-raising, Simon was borrowing a
theme of one of his rivals in the primary, Richard Riordan, who
accused Davis of showing up for work late and spending the better
part of his day hitting up donors.</TE>
<TE>   The third major GOP primary candidate, Secretary of State Bill
Jones of Fresno, introduced Simon on Friday to several dozen
agricultural leaders at the luncheon in his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   Simon promised the group he would reduce the "regulatory burden on
farmers," but avoided specifics, saying he was there to listen to
their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference after lunch, Jones and Simon repeatedly
professed unity in the effort to unseat Davis, but some tension
remained from their primary battle. In his introduction of Simon,
Jones--now co-chair of Simon's campaign--made a point of saying he
was "very discouraged at this low voter turnout" on Tuesday and said
it was critical "that we leave no vote behind." Jones and Riordan had
attacked Simon in TV commercials for not voting in more than a dozen
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his criticism of Simon during the campaign, including
his suggestion that Simon would need "on-the-job training" as
governor, Jones responded: "I stand by what I said."</TE>
<TE>   "I've encouraged Bill to make sure--and he's promised that he's
going to vote in every election," Jones said. "With respect to the
experience, yes, it is a concern. I made that clear."</TE>
<TE>   But Jones said Simon "will do a good job, and he'll bring people
around to help him."</TE>
<TE>   At an earlier stop, Simon met with former President Gerald Ford.
The candidate's father, William Simon, was Treasury secretary in the
Ford and Nixon administrations.</TE>
<TE>   Ford recalled that he and fellow Republicans Ronald Reagan and
George Bush had all won California in presidential races, despite the
GOP's dismal string of losses in more recent statewide elections.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm optimistic that with the issues Bill is emphasizing, he can
win in 2002," Ford said.</TE>
<TE>   The former president acknowledged that he disagrees with Simon's
opposition on abortion rights, but said he did not think it would be
an issue. "He's not making a point of what he's going to do about Roe
vs. Wade," Ford said. "That's the law of the land. He said he'll
support whatever the law is."</TE>

<HD>Upgraded Gas Tanks Are Still Leaking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the federal government ordered gas stations nationwide to
replace underground tanks that were leaking a possible carcinogen
into the ground water, state officials now find many of the new tanks
also leak.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists say the newly discovered leaks bolster their
arguments that Gov. Gray Davis should not delay phasing out the use
of the gasoline additive MTBE. Davis has been considering putting off
the ban, which is supposed to take effect Dec. 31.</LD>
<LD>   Preliminary results of a state study found that two-thirds of the
upgraded tanks and pipes tested in Yolo and Sacramento counties are
leaking MTBE.</LD>
<TE>   In Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, water officials
found that of 60 new double-sided tanks they monitored, a third are
still leaking gasoline. In addition, some built-in sensors supposed
to warn them about leakage aren't working.</TE>
<TE>   In the Silicon Valley, at least 40% of tested new tanks are
releasing MTBE. At one station in San Jose, vapor leakage resulted in
2,000 pounds of MTBE contaminating soil and ground water.</TE>
<TE>   "MTBE is a very significant threat to the ground water, not only
in our county but across the state," said Jim Crowley, a specialist
on the tanks who works for the Santa Clara Valley Water District.
"The underground storage-tank systems don't appear to be able to
contain MTBE."</TE>
<TE>   Leakage Problem Is Widespread in State</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has heard of similar
reports from other states, including Florida and South Carolina, said
Sammy Ng, deputy director of the EPA's office of underground storage
tanks. But the agency is watching California closely because the
problem has been found to be so widespread in the state.</TE>
<TE>   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, was first added to gasoline
more than two decades ago to reduce air pollution, and its use became
widespread in the early 1990s. It initially appeared to be a silver
bullet--a cheap additive that makes gas burn cleaner without harmful
side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Further study, however, found that MTBE is a suspected carcinogen
that spreads quickly through the soil and ground water and that even
in small amounts can make drinking water smell like turpentine. To
stem the seepage, oil companies replaced single-walled tanks and
pipes with double-walled equipment and added sensors. By 1998, under
federal order, nearly all of the tanks had been replaced.</TE>
<TE>   "That was supposed to cure the problem," said Ken Williams, chief
of the underground storage-tank section at the Santa Ana Regional
Water Quality Control Board, which enforces clean-water laws in parts
of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.</TE>
<TE>   He and other water experts don't know exactly how the gasoline is
still escaping. But growing contamination levels in the soil around
the tanks indicate it is indeed escaping.</TE>
<TE>   Ng believes the culprits are the vents and pipes that connect the
tanks to the gas pumps, rather than the tanks themselves. "There's a
lot of piping, a lot of joints. Any time the earth moves, you may
have cracks and leaks," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Carolin Keith, spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil Corp., said this is the
first she has heard that upgraded tanks or pipes are leaking. "As a
matter of course, any soil or ground-water contamination that results
from a leak in our equipment, we are both obligated and committed to
cleaning up," she said.</TE>
<TE>   MTBE contamination in soil and water nationwide is going to cost
at least $29 billion to clean up, according to a study commissioned
by Santa Monica and several other cities. And new contamination sites
continue to be discovered. In January, officials announced that a
plume of tainted ground water has moved close to a well that produces
drinking water for 17,000 homes in Rialto, Fontana, Colton and
Bloomington.</TE>
<TE>   Officials believe the problem is far more widespread than reports
indicate. Many gas station owners do not realize their tanks are
leaking, and one common testing method might allow the MTBE to
decompose before it can be analyzed.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say this is exactly why Davis must not delay the
planned phaseout of MTBE.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Concerned About Gas Shortages, Prices</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Davis declared the gasoline additive a threat to the
environment and ordered that its use in gasoline be phased out of
California by this coming December. But last month, he announced he
may delay the phaseout because it could create a gasoline shortage or
drive up prices. A final decision is expected in early April.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Rukeyser, deputy secretary of Cal-EPA, a state environmental
agency, said Davis will consider the environmental ramifications as
well as the economic consequences when making his final decision.</TE>
<TE>   He said the number of leaking tanks has decreased in recent years
and the equipment, though imperfect, is much improved.</TE>
<TE>   He reiterated, though, that the Davis administration is not
backing off from eliminating MTBE use.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how good the equipment and operators become ... we are
not going to reach a situation where we have achieved perfection and
where MTBE ceases to be a hazard to California's water supply,"
Rukeyser said.</TE>
<TE>   When MTBE is banned, gasoline makers will have to switch to
ethanol as an additive.</TE>
<TE>   But the Davis administration has said the state still lacks a way
to transport ethanol within the state. In addition, terminals and
refineries need to be retrofitted for the new additive.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is considering adjusting "the timetable somewhat to make
sure that the transition away from MTBE is smooth and doesn't result
in shocks to the system in the form of either outright shortages
and/or gas price hikes," Rukeyser said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say such a decision would be extremely
shortsighted.</TE>
<TE>   "We strongly believe that allowing MTBE to remain in gasoline will
lead to additional contamination of ground water and add billions of
dollars to an already staggering cleanup bill," wrote Marguerite
Young, the California director of environmental group Clean Water
Action, in a letter Friday to Davis.</TE>

<HD>Jury Awards $4.35 Million to Teacher in Harassment Case</HD>
<DH>Schools: She says L.A. Unified did little to stop student
newspaper that mocked her. District denies the accusation and vows to
appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury awarded $4.35 million in damages Friday to a Palisades High
School teacher who accused the Los Angeles Unified School District of
doing almost nothing to stop publication of a student newspaper that
depicted her as a porn star.</LD>
<LD>   The seven-woman, five-man Los Angeles Superior Court jury
deliberated for 31/2 hours before ruling in favor of Janis Adams, who
sued the district after 10 issues of the underground newspaper had
been distributed across campus over a three-month period.</LD>
<LD>   The jury awarded Adams $1.1 million for lost earnings and $3.25
million for emotional distress.</LD>
<TE>   "Today, the jury came back with a unanimous verdict to say what
happened to me was wrong," she said at a news conference at the
office of her attorneys, Nathan Goldberg and Gloria Allred. "To me
this means no other teacher will have to suffer what I did."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, school district general counsel Hal Kwalwasser
said he plans to appeal the jury verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we did everything possible to protect Mrs. Adams, and we
took action against the students," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kwalwasser also said Adams and the district were initially in
agreement that what the students needed was a stern admonishment for
what he described as "inappropriate behavior."</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Adams now takes the attitude we did nothing," he said,
"when, in fact, we did several things that were opposed by
countervailing forces, including students and the American Civil
Liberties Union."</TE>
<TE>   Adams declined to comment on Kwalwasser's assertions except to
say, "That's just not true at all. The district doesn't seem to get
it."</TE>
<TE>   Adams' husband, Mark Adams, was more blunt.</TE>
<TE>   The district's trial lawyer, he said, "unintentionally framed the
underlying issue in this case during her closing argument: Whose side
should the school district be on?</TE>
<TE>   "Should the district be on the side of some spoiled, rich kids who
raped their teacher with their words and their pictures? Or should
the district be on the side of a teacher who is just trying to do her
job and protect herself against sexual harassment?"</TE>
<TE>   Asked why Adams had not targeted the students and their families
in her lawsuit, her trial lawyer Goldberg said:</TE>
<TE>   "This was never about the kids. This was about her employer. The
district has an obligation to protect its employees from sexual
harassment."</TE>
<TE>   The jury, he added, "said the district has a rule book but didn't
read it."</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier interview, one student involved with the newspaper,
Michael Burke, said the administration and Adams overreacted to a
publication he dismissed as merely a prank.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's the generation gap that makes it look worse to adults
than to us," he said. "Or maybe we students don't know what's funny
and what's not."</TE>
<TE>   One article in the newspaper suggested ways of "making your
teacher cry."</TE>
<TE>   Some students began calling Adams names as she walked across the
campus. A handwritten death threat was posted on her classroom door.</TE>
<TE>   One article in the newspaper had Adams' face superimposed over a
nude woman's body.</TE>
<TE>   After Adams repeatedly complained about the hostile and abusive
working environment, district officials in March 2000 banned the
newspaper and transferred five students to another campus. Those
students, however, were allowed to graduate with diplomas from
Palisades High. Six other students were suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Adams took a leave of absence from the job that had earned her
consistently favorable performance evaluations.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my life," she said.
"I just hope that other teachers are not afraid to stand up."</TE>

woman's body.</CP>

<HD>Suspect in Fatal Stabbing Claims Self-Defense</HD>
<DH>Court: Lawyer says the defendant was jumped at a party. But
a Simi Valley detective disagrees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After being asked to leave a party in Simi Valley, 19-year-old Robert
Winters stabbed three men with a pocketknife and tossed the bloody
weapon on the roadside as he fled the scene, a police detective
testified Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Oct. 13, 2001, confrontation left one man dead, two others
injured and the suspect facing charges of murder and attempted murder
that could send him to prison for life.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, friends and relatives of the defendant and the victims
crowded into a Ventura County courtroom for a preliminary hearing.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Randy Tucker conceded in a brief opening
statement that Winters, a Ventura resident, stabbed the three men.
But Tucker told Superior Court Judge Ken Riley that his client acted
in self-defense after being jumped by drunk party-goers.</TE>
<TE>   The assertion conflicts with accounts given to police by some
witnesses, however.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley Police Det. Jay Carrott testified that, based on his
interviews with people at the party, Winters lunged at the victims
with an opened knife after being asked to leave.</TE>
<TE>   The stabbings occurred about 10 minutes after Winters showed up at
the Breton Avenue residence with friends and became involved in a
verbal altercation with another party-goer, Carrott testified.</TE>
<TE>   As victims Ryan Kramer and Mike Ponticelli tried to escort Winters
from the house, Kramer tripped on a step in the garage and he and
Winters fell to the ground, Carrott said. When Winters arose, he held
a knife and began swinging it "like a madman" at Kramer and
Ponticelli, Carrott added.</TE>
<TE>   Both men were struck and injured. But it was their friend,
21-year-old Randy Lucero, who suffered the fatal blows.</TE>
<TE>   According to Carrott's testimony, Winters buried the folding
knife's 3-inch blade into Lucero's chest, piercing his heart, after
Lucero rushed to the garage, possibly to break up the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Winters, who did not know the victims, fled the scene in the back
of a friend's pickup truck. The friend, Mike Ramirez, later told
police he saw Winters toss something over an embankment as they drove
away.</TE>
<TE>   Carrott searched the area and found a blood-stained knife, which
the assistant medical examiner matched to Lucero's wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Winters turned himself in to police two days after the stabbings.
In addition to the murder charges, he is accused of stealing beer
from a convenience store on the way to the party. He remains held in
lieu of $1 million in bail.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume Monday.</TE>

<DH>Los Angeles Zimriyah Chorale, formed for a single concert,
is still humming four years later.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Esther Hess has a story--a moment of ancestral significance at an old
concentration camp in the former Czechoslovakia--that explains the
power of the Los Angeles Zimriyah Chorale, and why a group formed for
a lone performance is now in its fourth year.</LD>
<LD>   It was 2000. Hess was touring with the chorale. The highlight of
the trip was to be its performance of Leonard Bernstein's "Kaddish"
with other choirs and orchestras at Nuremberg, Germany.</LD>
<LD>   But along the way, the chorale went to Terezin to perform the
songs of Victor Ullman, a composer who was imprisoned at the
concentration camp there and later died in the Holocaust. The singers
were taken to the camp.</LD>
<TE>   It was a moment Hess both desired and dreaded: She was not the
first singer in her family to be there.</TE>
<TE>   Hess' father, Leon Cytryn, had been imprisoned at Terezin by the
Nazis half a century before. Cytryn had a gift for singing, honed in
a synagogue choir.</TE>
<TE>   One day, a Nazi official asked, "Who sings?"</TE>
<TE>   Entertaining the captors promised a sliver of hope--or at least
extra rations--but Cytryn was shy and he didn't budge, his daughter
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a boyfriend who didn't sing a word, but he knew my dad
sang. This friend lifted his own hand and kind of nudged my dad's
hand up. It got them into the choir.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad sang, and his friend's mouth moved," she continued. "They
both survived."</TE>
<TE>   When the L.A. chorale performed in Terezin, said Hess, 44, "I felt
that I sang with the souls of those who died. To know my father's
singing kept him alive.... It was just a very strong connection."</TE>
<TE>   The choir was formed in 1998 to perform the music of Los Angeles
Jewish composers in that year's Zimriyah Choral Festival at Hebrew
University in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   The members--most of them professionals, including teachers,
lawyers, doctors and, in Hess' case, a child psychologist--were so
moved by a sense of pride that they decided to stay together.</TE>
<TE>   The group now includes about 48 singers, among them a 17-year old
high school student and an 80-year-old gentile. When they travel,
they pay their own expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The chorale will perform at a Passover-themed concert featuring
the Los Angeles Jewish Symphony Sunday at Beverly Hills High School.
The concert, titled "Celebrate Freedom," will feature a performance
of the late Ernest Toch's "Cantata of the Bitter Herbs," a musical
retelling of the Jews' flight from Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Some choir members said singing in the chorale reawakened an
appreciation of their culture.</TE>
<TE>   "This has given me a love of Judaism that I didn't have before,"
said J.B. Hiller, 54, a computer programmer who lives in Santa
Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan,
Hiller's experience with Jewish music was mostly limited to staid
chants in Orthodox synagogues. Early on, he sang in Christian choirs.
"The advantage was that Christians had Bach and Mozart. I wasn't even
aware of any great Jewish composers."</TE>
<TE>   He eventually joined a Jewish choir in Baltimore, but it wasn't
until Hiller came to Los Angeles and joined a now-defunct Jewish
chorale that he began to appreciate the breadth and width of Jewish
music--from the liturgical to the secular.</TE>
<TE>   He and other members of that chorale were among the singers who
joined L.A. Zimriyah.</TE>
<TE>   "A choir like the Zimriyah provides the Jewish community music
they might otherwise not get to hear," said the choir's director,
Nick Strimple, 55, a composer.</TE>
<TE>   Strimple, who is not Jewish, studied Czech music as a graduate
student at USC and came upon Jewish Holocaust music in his 40s after
he was asked by Czech officials to perform the work of a composer at
the Terezin concentration camp.</TE>
<TE>   He has become an admirer of Jewish music, even joining the choir
at Valley Beth Shalom in Encino. That choir will also perform at
tonight's concert.</TE>
<TE>   Once, secular community-based Jewish choral groups such as the
Zimriyah were relatively common. Today they are a rarity.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Braun, chairman of the Jewish Music Commission of Los
Angeles, which seeks groups to promote Jewish music, thinks the
decrease may stem from a decline in anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   "Until very recently, sometime after the second World War, Jews
were not welcome in other communal music activities," Braun said.
"They had their own choral societies, theatrical groups, music
groups.... There's been much more assimilation, which for better or
worse, has led to the decline of specific Jewish choral societies."</TE>
<TE>   Among Jewish choral groups, L.A. Zimriyah is one of the relatively
few that can perform a broad range of Jewish music at a level good
enough to be recorded, Braun said. That dearth sometimes forces the
commission to ask university choirs and Christian churches to perform
Jewish compositions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Esther Hess said her love of choral music has seeped into her work
with children who are autistic or have Asperger's disorder, an
emotional condition that makes them unable to process social cues
such as nuances in speech.</TE>
<TE>   "I sing some of my music to them," Hess said. The singing helps
the children learn about the nuances of voices--"the differences
between anger, happiness, sadness and fear."</TE>
<TE>   For J.B. Hiller, the love of Jewish music has become a family
affair. His wife, Mimi, and 27-year-old daughter, Jennifer, both
perform in the Zimriyah Chorale. It has also reconciled him with

<HD>Board Clashes Over Ahmanson Plan</HD>
<DH>Development: Ventura County supervisor is assailed after he
says the panel should be the one to do an environmental review of the
housing project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Growth politics flared anew on the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors Friday, with two supervisors condemning a third for
attempting to bring an environmental review of the 3,050-home
Ahmanson Ranch suburb directly to the board for a vote.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Steve Bennett said controversy surrounding the Ahmanson
Ranch project near Calabasas is so pitched that a scheduled
environmental review by county staff members should instead be done
by the supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   "When you have big controversial issues like this, we should be
doing the filtering right at the start," Bennett said. "We as a board
can say, 'Hey, we want you to check this out' before this comes back
to the board for a final vote."</LD>
<TE>   But two of Bennett's colleagues accused the slow-growth advocate
of trying to politicize the process.</TE>
<TE>   "We have professional people in our county that we pay to evaluate
the technical aspects of the project," said Supervisor Frank Schillo,
whose district includes Ahmanson Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "What Mr. Bennett is trying to do is subvert that process and make
this a political issue. It's really tampering with the system."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Kathy Long agreed the board should remain hands-off.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very focused, technical review," Long said. "So I'd
like the Environmental Report Review Committee to sit independent of
any political pressure and let them do their work."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors are expected to vote on the matter Tuesday. Supervisor
John Flynn said he was unsure which way he would go, and Supervisor
Judy Mikels was unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The six-member Environmental Report Review Committee is made up of
county planners and other staff members. They are scheduled on April
17 to review a follow-up environmental study ordered after biologists
found threatened frog and flower species on the Ahmanson Ranch
property three years ago. An initial environmental analysis of the
housing project was approved in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmanson Ranch opponents last month requested that the board
invoke a rarely used rule that permits supervisors to sit as the
review panel when there is "substantial controversy." Ahmanson fits
that category, Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the county set a precedent by applying that rule when the
project's first environmental study was approved.</TE>
<TE>   "You ought to have the ultimate policymakers hearing this stuff
right off the bat," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental studies typically are reviewed by the committee and
the county Planning Commission before coming to the Board of
Supervisors for final approval, said Tom Berg, director of the
county's planning division. A public hearing is held each step of the
way, Berg said.</TE>
<TE>   There is no good reason to divert from that process now, Berg
said. A spokesman for Washington Mutual, developer of Ahmanson Ranch,
agreed with the planning director.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to short-circuit the public's ability to comment
and we're not trying to telescope the reviews," spokesman Tim McGarry
said. "Let's let the process unfold."</TE>
<TE>   The planned suburb has withstood more than a dozen lawsuits by
opponents over the past decade. But opposition to the 2,800-acre
residential, retail and office development has gained strength in
recent months as well-connected activists revived a campaign to stop
the project.</TE>
<TE>   Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch, co-chaired by Hollywood director Rob
Reiner and HBO executive Chris Albrecht, has vowed to halt the
project regardless of county supervisors' decisions.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Calabasas and a growing group of Los Angeles
politicians and state legislators are also opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Katherine Stone, representing Calabasas, said opponents
are concerned their comments won't be taken seriously by the Board of
Supervisors if the environmental document has already been approved
by two panels.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern is that the final [study] will basically be
rubber-stamped," Stone said. "At that level, the decisions have
already been made."</TE>

<HD>For Survivors of a Dark Chapter of World War II, an
Epilogue</HD>
<DH>Reunion: Headed for the Battle of the Bulge, their ship was
hit by a torpedo and sunk. Tonight, 15 veterans reunite for what is
probably the last time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were young Army soldiers, some barely out of high school, most
not old enough to take their first legal drink, when their ship was
sunk by a German torpedo on Christmas Eve 1944.</LD>
<LD>   Those who survived the sinking of the Leopoldville have reunited
over the years, swapping war stories and remembering the attack that
killed so many of their buddies. But a reunion this weekend in Dana
Point will probably be their last.</LD>
<LD>   The youngest of the bunch are now 76. Many of the survivors of
Company I have died. Others have lost their sight or their hearing or
are too frail to make the trip.</LD>
<TE>   "I do think this might be the last hurrah," said George Reisteter,
76, a Bethlehem, Pa., resident who will attend tonight's reunion
dinner at the Marbella Country Club in San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   Reisteter had hoped to see his old staff sergeant, George Chun
Fat. But the short trip from his San Diego home would be too much for
Chun Fat, now 92 and suffering from hearing loss and the beginning
stages of Alzheimer's disease.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to love to go to these reunions," said his brother Frank,
also a World War II veteran. "He always used to talk about them. But
he told me that he's too old now."</TE>
<TE>   Like other groups of veterans who lived through the battles of
World War II, the soldiers who survived the sinking of the
Leopoldville have fewer and fewer to share stories with at their
reunions. Once there were 180 men in Company I, but nearly half of
them died in the war. This year, only 15 of the old soldiers will
attend the reunion.</TE>
<TE>   The sinking of the Leopoldville was one of the chapters of the war
that the military kept secret, fearing it would boost the morale of
the Germans. Details of the sinking remained confidential, and the
military didn't officially acknowledge the maritime incident until
the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But at the reunions, the stories come back to life.</TE>
<TE>   Reisteter said the night before boarding the Leopoldville, Chun
Fat, a husky, jovial native of Hawaii, was unusually solemn. He had a
premonition.</TE>
<TE>   "He was sitting on his bunk and saying the rosary," Reisteter
said. "I went over and put my arm around him and said, 'Something's
bothering you. What is it?' And he said, 'Tomorrow night, we won't
all be together anymore.'"</TE>
<TE>   Reisteter and Chun Fat were among some 2,200 66th Infantry
Division soldiers who boarded the Belgian troopship on a cold, damp
Christmas Eve morning. They crossed the English Channel to Cherbourg,
France, where they were to spend two nights before being moved to the
front line to fight in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Beran, 19 at the time, recalled falling asleep in a hammock
aboard the ship, a copy of the New Testament in his shirt pocket.
When the torpedo hit, he thought it was a drill. But when he opened
his eyes, he saw the air was heavy with smoke. He smelled fuel. And
he saw water rushing in.</TE>
<TE>   Squad Sgt. Donald Goble, 20 at the time, said he was also below
deck, stretched out on the floor beside his buddy. He said he was
jolted awake by the explosion. He reached over for his friend, but
all he felt was water.</TE>
<TE>   "He was gone. He just disappeared," Goble said. "I never saw him
again."</TE>
<TE>   Reisteter said he remembers hearing people groaning and realizing
they were trapped in the wreckage. The blast had knocked out the
stairwell leading to the deck, and Reisteter said the water was
rising quickly. He reached into a pocket and pulled out his rosary
beads.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is I said my last prayers," Reisteter said.</TE>
<TE>   He said someone--he never found out who--pulled him onto the deck,
where he could see the lights of Cherbourg. He recalled some of the
soldiers sang Christmas carols as the wreckage of their ship bobbed
in the ocean, 51/2 miles off the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Goble said he crawled onto the deck of the listing ship and waited
for an advancing tugboat to carry him to safety. Reisteter was left
to figure out how to board a British destroyer that had pulled
alongside the sinking Leopoldville in the rough sea.</TE>
<TE>   "The British sailors were telling us, 'Jump, mate, jump,'"
Reisteter said. "If you didn't jump right, you would have fallen in
between the ships and gotten crushed."</TE>
<TE>   Beran was with a group of soldiers on the other side of the ship.
There was no tugboat, no destroyer to rescue them. Just the waiting
ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "A commander finally said, 'Let's hit the water. This ship's going
down,'" Beran said.</TE>
<TE>   Beran said he was sucked under the water by the sheer force of the
sinking Leopoldville.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember thinking that my mother would be terribly pained that
I, the youngest and the last to go to war, would be killed first,"
Beran said, who had three older brothers.</TE>
<TE>   His life vest shot him to the surface after a few seconds. He said
he saw a fishing boat in the distance and began swimming in its
direction. The rest is black, until he woke up in a military
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 802 men died that night--75 from Company I. For years, the
military kept documents detailing the incident secret. Reisteter said
he kept the memory buried for 25 years. It wasn't until he attended
the first Company I reunion in 1969 that he found himself talking
openly.</TE>
<TE>   "We went through an experience that you couldn't really describe
to somebody else," Reisteter said. "I don't think I ever even told my
family about it. It was a part of my life that was tucked away in a
corner of my mind, and when I got there, that's when it all came
out."</TE>
<TE>   Though there are 54 Company I soldiers still alive, only 15 will
attend this year's reunion, including Goble, who is driving from his
home in Arizona, and Beran, of Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   Beran is matter-of-fact about the dwindling number of soldiers who
attend the reunions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all just getting old. "</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Simon Attacks Davis Over Fiscal Woes</HD>
<DH>Politics: The incumbent ignored state's problems while focusing on
raising funds for reelection, the GOP challenger says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr. charged Friday that
Gov. Gray Davis failed to anticipate the state's fiscal troubles because
he was too busy raising money for his reelection campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Simon attacked his Democratic opponent's ethics at a luncheon of
agricultural leaders. By ignoring the state's energy and fiscal problems,
Simon told them, Davis left the budget 'totally out of control' with a
$17-billion shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   If the governor had talked to farmers, Silicon Valley engineers or
Southern California home builders, Simon said, he would have known the
economy would slow down and state revenues would drop.</LD>
<TE>   'But he didn't,' Simon said. 'He was too busy raising money. The only
deficit he was trying to fill was the one in his campaign account.' So
far, Davis and lawmakers have trimmed about $3 billion from an estimated
$17.5-billion deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Davis reelection strategist Garry South responded to Simon's charges
by belittling the Republican nominee, whose lack of experience in
government has been a key focus of the governor's attacks.</TE>
<TE>   'Unlike rich kid Billy Simon, who inherited fantastic wealth from his
father, Gray Davis doesn't have his own personal money that he can put
into his campaign,' South said. 'He has to raise it.'</TE>
<TE>   Simon, a Pacific Palisades businessman, put $5 million of his personal
fortune into his campaign for the GOP nomination. He said Friday that he
expects his general election campaign to cost $30 million to $40 million,
but declined to say how much of his own money he would spend.</TE>
<TE>   By attacking the governor's fund-raising, Simon was borrowing a theme
of one of his rivals in the primary, Richard Riordan, who accused Davis
of showing up for work late and spending the better part of his day
hitting up donors.</TE>
<TE>   The third major GOP primary candidate, Secretary of State Bill Jones
of Fresno, introduced Simon on Friday to several dozen agricultural
leaders at the luncheon in his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   Simon promised the group he would reduce the 'regulatory burden on
farmers,' but avoided specifics, saying he was there to listen to their
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference after lunch, Jones and Simon repeatedly professed
unity in the effort to unseat Davis, but some tension remained from their
primary battle. In his introduction of Simon, Jones-now co-chair of
Simon's campaign-made a point of saying he was 'very discouraged at this
low voter turnout' on Tuesday and said it was critical 'that we leave no
vote behind.' Jones and Riordan had attacked Simon in TV commercials for
not voting in more than a dozen elections.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his criticism of Simon during the campaign, including his
suggestion that Simon would need 'on-the-job training' as governor, Jones
responded: 'I stand by what I said.'</TE>
<TE>   'I've encouraged Bill to make sure-and he's promised that he's going
to vote in every election,' Jones said. 'With respect to the experience,
yes, it is a concern. I made that clear.'</TE>
<TE>   But Jones said Simon 'will do a good job, and he'll bring people
around to help him.'  At an earlier stop, Simon met with former President
Gerald Ford. The candidate's father, William Simon, was Treasury
secretary in the Ford and Nixon administrations.  Ford recalled that he
and fellow Republicans Ronald Reagan and George Bush had all won
California in presidential races, despite the GOP's dismal string of
losses in more recent statewide elections.</TE>
<TE>   'I'm optimistic that with the issues Bill is emphasizing, he can win
in 2002,' Ford said.</TE>
<TE>   The former president acknowledged that he disagrees with Simon's
opposition on abortion rights, but said he did not think it would be an
issue. 'He's not making a point of what he's going to do about Roe vs.
Wade,' Ford said. 'That's the law of the land. He said he'll support
whatever the law is.'</TE>

the way for restarting talks.</DH>

<DL>ATZMONA, Gaza Strip
</DL>
<LD>On the deadliest day yet in 17 months of strife, Israel on Friday
stormed refugee camps, took scores of prisoners and bombarded enemy
positions ahead of the arrival of the United States' special Middle East
envoy.</LD>
<LD>   But even as Israel escalated its ferocious assault on targets across
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon slightly eased
his insistence on seven days of quiet before he would agree to cease-fire
talks. That condition has been a stumbling block because the Palestinians
have been unable to meet it to Sharon's satisfaction.</LD>
<LD>   "Negotiations to stop the shooting will be held under fire," Sharon
told Israeli television. If true, this represents a significant shift in
Israeli government policy.</LD>
<TE>   The suggestion of new flexibility on Sharon's part came on a day when
at least 38 Palestinians and six Israelis were killed. Israeli officials
say they have launched the offensive to crush terrorists who have killed
dozens of Jews, including children, in suicide bombings and shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Palestinians killed Friday were gunmen. But the dead also
included a hospital administrator, a mother of five, and two boys, 9 and
12.</TE>
<TE>   The massive operation Friday and early today followed the killing of
five Israeli students by an Islamic militant who penetrated their
settlement in Gaza. Defense Ministry officials also said Israel was
making a final offensive push before U.S. special envoy Anthony C. Zinni
arrives next week to press for a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   After keeping the Middle East at arm's length for most of his time in
office, President Bush, apparently alarmed at the unprecedented level of
spilled blood, reversed himself Thursday and dispatched Zinni.</TE>
<TE>   Zinni, who failed to quell violence during two earlier visits, will
face an even more difficult task this time. Although Israelis and
Palestinians both formally said they welcomed his return, they also have
an interest in sustaining military pressure and exacting more revenge.</TE>
<TE>   In a violent showdown that some feared would end in a blood bath,
Israeli forces who had taken over two refugee camps in the West Bank city
of Tulkarm surrounded Palestinian gunmen holed up inside one of the camps
Friday and demanded that they surrender.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the day, the gunmen and soldiers exchanged fire
sporadically. Residents said they were forced to hide in their homes as
soldiers moved from building to building, cutting through walls as they
went.</TE>
<TE>   On bullhorns, the troops called on men between 14 and 40 to report to
a central United Nations-run school, according to residents reached by
telephone. There, soldiers took away their cellular phones.</TE>
<TE>   One Israeli soldier was killed in the Tulkarm battle. At least seven
Palestinians were killed, but there were fears of many more casualties
inside the camp. As fighting raged, the Israeli army sealed off the camp
and banned ambulances and humanitarian aid workers from entering, citing
the dangers of ongoing shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of soldiers going around and snipers on buildings
around the camp," said one camp resident, who gave his name as Iyad.
"Nobody can move."</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, the Israeli army reported that dozens of men had
surrendered. Television footage released by the military showed scores of
Palestinian men seated on the ground, their hands on their heads. Others
were stripped of their shirts and marched away. Still others were
handcuffed and blindfolded.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said more than 200 suspects were
captured in Tulkarm, hundreds of weapons were confiscated and several
bomb-making workshops were located. But Palestinians said most of those
shown in the television pictures were ordinary residents and not
fighters, most of whom they said had slipped away.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday afternoon in Jerusalem, police shot dead a Palestinian man
they said was about to detonate a bomb strapped to his body.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, the traditional birthplace of Jesus, streets were still
and shuttered Friday after a night of thunderous airstrikes and early
morning gun battles that ushered tanks into positions around the Aida and
Dahaisha refugee camps.</TE>
<TE>   By nightfall Friday, eight Palestinians had been killed and 20 wounded
in Bethlehem, hospital officials said. One was a fighter from the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade killed when a tank shell hit his car, and three were
policemen; a 36-year-old mother of five and a 42-year-old hospital
administrator also were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail Hawajah, 36, a teacher, was beyond tears Friday as he sat on a
low concrete ledge outside the doors of Beit Jala Government Hospital,
his head bowed and relatives gathered around him. Hawajah's wife, Huda,
had been declared dead on arrival at the hospital a few hours before.</TE>
<TE>   She was killed, relatives said, when Israeli troops began breaking
down doors and walls of houses in the Aida camp, moving from one house to
the next Friday morning in search of gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   "She put the children in one room, and she and Ismail were in the
other," said her brother, who declined to give his name. "The army threw
a bomb to break the door, and she was hit with shrapnel."</TE>
<TE>   Her family said she bled to death when an ambulance was delayed by an
hour.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli army spokeswoman said she could not respond to the specific
charge that ambulances were delayed getting into Aida but said the army
must sometimes block emergency rescue vehicles when gun battles are
raging. Israeli officials also charge that Palestinian ambulances are
sometimes used to carry weapons and gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   In the Jewish settlement of Atzmona in the southern Gaza Strip,
workers Friday wiped up blood and plastered holes left by shrapnel in the
walls of a religious military training academy attacked overnight by a
lone Palestinian militant.</TE>
<TE>   The attacker, armed with a gun and grenades, walked through an opening
in an electrical fence, cut through a second wire fence and sprinted over
sand dunes into the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Under cover of darkness, he hurled six grenades into dorm rooms where
Israeli youths--cadets preparing for enrollment in the Israeli army's
most elite units--were sleeping, studying or praying. Then he raked the
buildings with automatic gunfire, emptying nine clips. Five teenagers
were killed, including Arik Krugliak, 18, who burned to death when his
room caught fire.</TE>
<TE>   The killer was later identified as Mohammed Farahat, 19, a member of
the militant group Hamas from Gaza City. His rampage lasted about 15
minutes before one resident, an army officer named Ayal Tam, killed him.</TE>
<TE>   The neighboring settlement, Bedolah, was similarly invaded and
attacked by Palestinian commandos about six months ago, in an incident
that triggered chagrined military admissions of a lapse in security.</TE>
<TE>   The residents of Atzmona were circumspect Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "To close all of the settlements so that nobody can get in is very
difficult," said Yona Emanuel, an accountant for the Atzmona community.
"We know we live in a place that is not always secure. The army is caring
for our security but is not always going to succeed. That's the way it is
in a war."</TE>
<TE>   Emanuel, 47, was one of the many residents who charged the shooter
shortly after the attack began.</TE>
<TE>   The Atzmona school is one of 14 army-prep academies that channel
religious youths into the upper echelon of the Israeli military. It had
about 120 students. On Friday, the students were bused from funeral to
funeral for their five classmates.</TE>
<TE>   The single deadliest gun battle of the day raged in the village of
Khuzaa in the southern Gaza Strip, about three miles from Atzmona. Dozens
of tanks and armored vehicles roared into the village from three sides
about 1 a.m. Paratroops moved from street to street and took up positions
in olive groves and in buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Almost instantly, a Palestinian police officer and two members of his
family were killed. The commander of national security forces for the
southern half of Gaza, Maj. Gen. Ahmed Mefrej, rushed to the village and
was killed. In fighting that followed, 12 more Palestinians were killed
in Khuzaa.</TE>
<TE>   At midday Friday, 16 bodies shrouded in green flags were laid, side by
side, in a schoolyard in nearby Khan Yunis. Thousands attended the
funerals, many men firing guns and shouting angry demands for revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Four Palestinians were killed in other parts of Gaza, and another was
killed near the West Bank town of Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, by announcing his willingness to negotiate a cease-fire, hopes
to place the ball in Arafat's court. But the relentless fighting has
hardened both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian militants have tasted success in a recent string of
operations that hit the Israeli military hard.</TE>
<TE>   As unlikely as it may seem, the militants are sufficiently encouraged
by their gains to contemplate being able to force Israel to withdraw
unilaterally from the West Bank and Gaza, much as it withdrew from
Lebanon in 2000 after a relentless war of attrition waged by Islamic
Hezbollah guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon is acutely aware of this and has been determined to crush the
Palestinians militarily before entertaining any sort of negotiation. His
public statements to that effect apparently alarmed the Bush
administration and prodded it to act. After months of focusing reproach
exclusively on Arafat, Washington seems likely now to pressure Sharon to
restrain his troops.</TE>
<TE>   Zinni's presence could give the two sides a face-saving reason to call
off military operations. But that will depend largely on whether the U.S.
wants to get deeply involved.</TE>

<HD>Major Hurdles for U.S. in Rugged Border Province</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Geography, warlord rivalries hobble the hunt for Al
Qaeda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GARDEZ, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>If geography is destiny, then the difficult battle by Americans to
rid eastern Afghanistan of Al Qaeda members was probably inevitable.</LD>
<LD>   Mountains are made for guerrilla wars. And porous borders are made for
guerrillas seeking sanctuary.</LD>
<LD>   Paktia province has both: Two-thirds of the land is mountain range,
and it shares a long border with Pakistan's so-called tribal areas, where
government control is limited and tribal leaders are generally willing to
give refuge to the highest bidder.</LD>
<TE>   It is probably not an accident that nine of the 10 Americans lost to
hostile fire in Afghanistan have died in the terrain of Paktia, where
Americans are fighting Taliban and Al Qaeda holdouts.</TE>
<TE>   The American experience in Paktia--marked by missteps and
misguidance--presents a kind of case study of the obstacles the United
States faces in trying to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan. There is
little question that the province offers distinct advantages to the
United States' enemies: It is easy to hide there, easy to move without
being seen, and the weak central government exercises little control.</TE>
<TE>   What Americans may not have fully understood when they first arrived
secretly in Paktia in December was that they faced a war on many fronts.</TE>
<TE>   There was the war with the Al Qaeda fighters holed up in mountain
villages, some of whom crossed back and forth into Pakistan. But the U.S.
also had to deal with a tribal war involving the province's biggest
commanders--all of whom had heavily armed forces and were vying for
control. Some had links to Al Qaeda, all had personal agendas, and
nothing was what it seemed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no other province that has such severe difficulties as
Paktia," said Fazlullah, the governor of neighboring Lowgar province, who
is known as a reasonable voice in this part of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans did not have much precise information about the
situation when they came," he said. "And there are a lot of tribes there.
Some are bad and others worse. The Americans did not consult much before
they came."</TE>
<TE>   Most of America's activities in Afghanistan have been conducted in
secret, and the U.S. military in the region refuses to discuss its
strategy with reporters. But conversations with tribal leaders and local
commanders paint a portrait of a place that the American military knew
was going to pose major problems from early on in the war, and where the
U.S. was hampered by violent local politics and a serious lack of
reliable intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   In part as a result, the Americans initially made what appear to have
been a series of misjudgments--probably based on flawed intelligence from
local players with scores to settle--that may have cost them credibility
in the province. It may also have rallied some of the population against
the anti-Taliban war effort, delaying the Americans' ability to move
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   In at least three instances--on Dec. 22, Dec. 29 and Feb. 4--Americans
bombed villages and convoys, apparently killing civilians. In one case,
it was a convoy that included scores of tribal elders and family leaders
going to Kabul, the capital, to attend the induction of Hamid Karzai as
prime minister of the interim Afghan government. About 60 people died in
the bombing, according to witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Department officials maintain that the bombs hit their mark,
with the implication that either Taliban or Al Qaeda members were in the
group, but local people and several diplomats believe otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "They were handicapped by a lack of field intelligence at the
beginning of the operation," said a senior diplomat who has spent more
than a decade in Afghanistan. "It sounds like the situation is improving,
but there's a political contest for control of southern Afghanistan, and
the Americans are caught in the middle of it."</TE>
<TE>   Paktia has long lived by its own rules. It is now best thought of as
having two major spheres of influence--north and south, divided by a high
mountain pass--each with its own set of players and allegiances.</TE>
<TE>'No Al Qaeda Here'</TE>
<TE>   The north is controlled by Haji Saifullah, 57, who heads the Gardez
shura, or local council. Saifullah, a lean man with hollow cheeks and
burning eyes under heavy eyebrows and a well-wound turban, is quick to
declare his allegiance to Karzai and to claim that any Al Qaeda members
merely passed through Gardez as they fled the country.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no Al Qaeda here," he said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   During the Taliban's rule, however, according to the accounts of aid
workers and local people, the Gardez leadership worked closely with the
Islamic government and supported its needs, probably in part to preserve
its hold on the lucrative smuggling routes that run to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Paktia, whose major city is Khowst, is controlled by a
warlord named Bacha Khan. The burly, heavily mustached fighter has real
credentials as a Taliban opponent but is a bully and, says one Western
diplomat, "of limited political competence."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Khan linked up with the Americans late last year, he began
boasting about his ability to call in B-52 bombers to eliminate his
enemies. Whether he actually had that power has never been clear, but his
enemies believe that he does.</TE>
<TE>   It was into this contentious landscape that the Americans parachuted
in December. Special Forces soldiers arrived by helicopter near the top
of the Tira Pass, which leads to Gardez in the northern half of the
province. They spoke little to the Afghan fighters at first, doing
reconnaissance with little local input.</TE>
<TE>   "They would come at night and go into the mountains," said Hamidullah,
a local soldier who sometimes staffs a checkpoint at the pass. "We saw
them many times. They never told us what they were doing."</TE>
<TE>   The surrounding area was thought to be honeycombed with Al Qaeda
hideaways in small villages, cave complexes and among the local
population. After several weeks of these explorations, the Americans
appear to have confirmed that Paktia was a problem and they needed an
infrastructure in the province--loyal local commanders and local
intelligence--to fight Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Around the first of January, a contingent of 15 Americans rode down
from Lowgar province in Datsun pickups, the vehicle of choice for
commanders of all stripes in Afghanistan, to make their first overtures
to the Gardez shura. Their goal was to set up one of two clandestine
bases in the province that would ultimately be used for Operation
Anaconda and any number of other smaller missions.</TE>
<TE>   "They asked us to recommend a quiet place where they could set up
security," said Saifullah, the warlord and leader of the Gardez shura.</TE>
<TE>   Saifullah recommended a large compound about a mile south of Gardez
that is known locally as "the castle." The Americans rented it for 5,000
Pakistani rupees a month, less than $100. Paktia's population has such
close relations with Pakistan that merchants refuse to accept Afghan
currency.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Americans began spreading money around. They hired 200 to 300
men for $200 a month apiece and used about 100 for security and trained
the rest to fight as soldiers. "They provided everything for the men:
boots, uniforms, arms, whatever people needed," said Mohammed Isak, a
deputy to Saifullah.</TE>
<TE>   Did the Americans get good information from their local allies, and
are they getting it now? It is hard to say, but there is plenty of
disingenuousness, and plenty of strange characters, in the Gardez region,
according to central government officials and local leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The official leadership in Gardez, for instance, disclaims any
knowledge of Al Qaeda in the area, but people with more ties to the
central government tell a different story.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Amin, an engineer, works closely with the Afghan army based
in Gardez, which is loyal to the central government. "Before the
Americans came, the Al Qaeda and Taliban were right here and now they are
still in the south in Zormat, southwest of Gardez," he said. Three weeks
later, Zormat is at the center of the battle in Paktia.</TE>
<TE>Double Agent in Midst</TE>
<TE>   Another possible source of flawed intelligence may have come from the
very people the Americans hoped would give them tips on the location of
Taliban and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, one of the people who received a satellite phone for
relaying information was Maulani Monib, a bespectacled former Taliban
deputy minister for telecommunications, who had a coy manner and
constantly changing story.</TE>
<TE>   First, he said he got his phone from the United Nations, but when
queried about who at the United Nations had given it to him, he said it
had come from a former general in the Pakistani city of Peshawar. He was
using it, he said, "for community work to help form a [governing] loya
jirga."</TE>
<TE>   People in Gardez said he got it from the Americans, and it certainly
seems unlikely that anybody else was handing out satellite phones, an
expensive and treasured commodity in this part of the world.</TE>
<TE>   But the Americans misjudged if they trusted his tips, said a
high-ranking official in the Interior Ministry. Monib was a double agent,
working both for the Americans and for either former members of the
Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence Agency connected to Al Qaeda or
directly for Al Qaeda, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Monib says he is a more moderate person, but we know from our
intelligence that he is very dangerous and supplied money to the people
at Zormat," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Monib, whom this reporter interviewed in mid-January, had disappeared
by mid-February, apparently when it became known that he had more than
one employer.</TE>
<TE>   The picture is little better in southern Paktia around Khowst, where
about 120 Special Forces soldiers are camped in a former prison. The
soldier in charge of the base is known locally as General John; his
deputy speaks fluent Dari, but even so the going seems rough.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than denying the existence of Al Qaeda, the family that
controls the region, including Bacha Khan and his brothers Kamal and
Wazir, and the powerful chief of security, Surgul, brand every enemy "Al
Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   After some of the nomadic people known as Kuchis attacked the Khan
brothers' fighters, killing two, the brothers went to the U.S. base in
Khowst and demanded retribution. "We told them, 'Definitely we're
completely sure there are Al Qaeda with the Kuchis. Accept our demand and
bomb them,' " Surgul said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what the evidence was, Surgul said, "We think there are Al Qaeda
there because when we went there they shot at us."</TE>
<TE>   But in a region where everybody shoots at one another--especially
when, as in this case, they are competitors for control of the
border--that seems a slender reed on which to hang a bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is any truth here. . . . None of them are good
guys," said a frustrated-sounding Special Forces soldier, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity because some of his comrades met with local
commanders in Khowst.</TE>
<TE>   "One-third of the people want us here, one-third could care less, and
one-third hate our guts," he said.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. economy added jobs in February--the first such gain in
seven months--pushing unemployment down to 5.5% and capping two weeks of
signs that the recession is finally giving way to recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Employers hired a net 66,000 workers last month after laying off
126,000 in January and 106,000 in December, the Labor Department said
Friday. Although officials cautioned that the hiring may have been the
result of temporary factors such as the unusually warm winter, most
analysts treated the new figure as the missing piece needed to confirm
that the recovery is underway.</LD>
<LD>   Also Friday, Congress approved a long-delayed measure to extend
federal aid to the unemployed, as well as provide billions of dollars in
business tax breaks in an effort to rev the economy. President Bush is
expected to sign the bill into law today.</LD>
<TE>   "This is as good as it gets," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist
with Hoenig &amp; Co., a Rye Brook, N.Y., brokerage firm. "The numbers speak
to the fact the recession is ending without saying anything about a
boom."</TE>
<TE>   Investors and some analysts have begun to worry that instead of
inching out of recession, the economy could bolt out, forcing the Federal
Reserve to reverse course and start raising interest rates to dampen
growth.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet
March 19 and expected to leave its signal-sending short-term interest
rate at a four-decade low of 1.75%. But the committee may declare that
its policy is no longer tilted in favor of further rate cuts.</TE>
<TE>   February's jobless rate was down from January's 5.6%, the second
straight monthly drop and the lowest rate since October. If the decline
spells a trend, unemployment would have topped out at 5.8% in December,
by far the lowest jobless peak of any recession since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The unemployment rate for Latinos fell in February from 8.1% to 7.1%,
the Labor Department said. The rate for blacks slid to 9.6% from 9.8%,
the department said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the government and industry groups have issued a
string of surprisingly rosy economic reports.</TE>
<TE>   Washington boosted its estimate of growth in the final quarter of last
year from a barely perceptible 0.2% to 1.4%. Trade groups said existing
homes were selling at a record annual rate in January of 6.07 million
units, and new autos were sailing out of showrooms at a respectable
annual rate of 16.7 million vehicles last month--even with an end to
no-interest financing deals.</TE>
<TE>   The rash of good news prompted Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to take the
unusual step Thursday of altering previously delivered House testimony
that a recovery might begin soon in order to tell the Senate that one "is
already well underway."</TE>
<TE>   The combination of events pushed stocks higher Friday. The
technology-laden Nasdaq composite index climbed 48.04 points, or 2.6%, to
1,929.67. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 6.77, or 0.6%, to
1,164.31. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 47.12, or 0.4%, to
10,572.49.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow gained nearly 2% for the week, posting its longest winning
streak since May and extending its year-to-date advance to 5.5%. The S&amp;P
added 2.9% for the week, erasing its losses for the year, and Nasdaq rose
7%, paring its loss for the year so far to 1.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Labor Department officials said most of the February employment gains,
which occurred for the first time since August, "can be attributed to
special factors," especially warm weather that boosted construction
employment by 25,000 and retail payrolls by 58,000.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said the employment numbers were still good news.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if they were flat, that would be good," said Banc of America
Securities economist Peter E. Kretzmer. "It shows labor market
deterioration is on the wane."</TE>
<TE>   Especially encouraging, analysts said, was the fact the nation's
long-suffering manufacturing sector lost only 50,000 jobs in February.
That was an improvement over the 110,000 monthly loss that goods makers
averaged during the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Also encouraging was the addition of 14,000 workers in the industry
that provides temporary workers to other businesses. It has borne much of
the brunt of recent job losses. Industry employment is down 655,000, or
18.5%, from its September 2000 peak.</TE>
<TE>   Average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers, who
make up about 80% of the nation's work force, rose only 2 cents to
$14.63. In the last year, hourly earnings are up 3.7%, the Labor
Department said.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate voted 85 to 9 on Friday for a bill extending jobless
benefits and providing business tax breaks designed to spur growth. The
vote came a day after the House approved the measure by a 417-3 vote,
capping a months-long partisan debate over how--and whether--Washington
should help an economy that appears to be mending on its own.</TE>
<TE>   "This will help folks who have been hurt, and it will provide a direct
economic stimulus," said Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.). He was one of 37
Democrats who voted for the bill, including Sens. Dianne Feinstein and
Barbara Boxer of California.</TE>
<TE>   Only one Republican, Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, voted
against the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, people who applied for unemployment benefits after
March 15 of last year would be eligible for extended aid if they
exhausted what is now up to six months of eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would grant workers nationwide as many as 13 additional weeks
of federal unemployment checks.</TE>
<TE>   In certain states with high levels of unemployment--congressional
aides say California is one--workers could receive a second extension of
up to 13 weeks. As a result, some workers would be eligible for up to a
year of relief.</TE>
<TE>   This week's action came as Congress was under increasing pressure to
help people left unemployed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. For
many of them, unemployment benefits will begin to expire Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The extensions of benefits, which would expire at the end of this
year, would cost more than $12 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Extending jobless aid is a routine step in Washington to ease the pain
of a recession. But the business tax breaks in the bill were more
controversial.</TE>
<TE>   The most significant pro-business provision, costing $32 billion in
2003, would encourage companies to make capital investments by granting
them 30% tax write-offs for the next three years on the purchase of
certain equipment. The tax break on depreciation is seen as a boon to the
high-tech industry but goes further than many Democrats wanted.</TE>

<HD>Resettled and Happy in Zimbabwe</HD>
<DH>Africa: As vote begins, many praise president for empowering
blacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MVURWI, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>As a teacher for 13 years on a commercial farm in this rural
backwater, Dozen Mhembere made less than $40 a month. His wife toiled on
a neighboring farm, where she lived with their five children, a table and
a shelf. They slept on the floor. They had no savings.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the Mhemberes own a dining room set, a new sideboard, a
portable television, a bed and a cot for the youngest child. They're
saving for a new house and car.</LD>
<LD>   "When we were working on the commercial farm, we were unable to drink
tea daily," said Mhembere, 46. "Now we are able to drink rich tea, with
lots of milk."</LD>
<TE>   The change in the family's fortunes came in November 2000, when
Mhembere received his own plot of land under a controversial government
program to seize property from white commercial farmers and distribute it
to landless blacks.</TE>
<TE>   As Zimbabweans head to the polls today and Sunday to cast ballots for
president, they are concerned about jobs, food and law and order, but
their real hunger is for land, and it is this issue that will ultimately
determine the country's direction.</TE>
<TE>   The election pits incumbent President Robert Mugabe and his Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front, or ZANU-PF, against Morgan
Tsvangirai, a former trade unionist who leads the Movement for Democratic
Change, or MDC.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe has critics both at home and abroad who blame him for
Zimbabwe's collapsing economy. They say he has run a corrupt government
and used violence and repressive laws to rig this weekend's election and
cling to power.</TE>
<TE>   But thousands of downtrodden rural dwellers praise the president--an
articulate and well-educated former schoolteacher--as a champion for
black empowerment. Many fear that without Mugabe at the helm, Zimbabwe
might slip back under the yoke of former colonial master Britain, and
that his moves toward redressing the inequity of landownership between
black and white Zimbabweans might be reversed.</TE>
<TE>   "Land is our priority, and it always has been," said Mavis Gumbo, a
Ministry of Information official in the capital, Harare.</TE>
<TE>   Pitting blacks against whites in a struggle for a bigger slice of the
country's resources, the land redistribution program has elicited strong
interest and, the ruling party argues, interference from the West.</TE>
<TE>Farm Takeovers Often Fraught With Violence</TE>
<TE>   The government has listed for takeover and distribution to landless
blacks about 95%, or 20 million acres, of the farmland owned by about
4,000 white farmers. Hundreds of the farms have been occupied, often
violently, by ruling party militants and veterans of the country's war of
independence from Britain, which was won in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   In the mayhem, nine white farmers have been killed and thousands of
black laborers displaced. In the two years since the program began,
90,000 people have been resettled nationwide, some government officials
estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Government supporters say white farmers brought the land seizures on
themselves by ignoring government pleas to sell their property in the
1980s and '90s.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to do it in a civilized manner and buy the land on a
willing buyer, willing seller basis," said Edwell Hukuimwe, information
officer for the district of Mazowe, 75 miles north of Harare, where
hundreds of families have been resettled. "But there were no willing
sellers."</TE>
<TE>   Critics call the land resettlement program a desperate attempt by
Mugabe to muster votes and deflect attention from other pressing
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The workers are concerned about bread-and-butter issues," said John
Makumbe, chairman of Transparency International-Zimbabwe and a political
science professor. "They are concerned about jobs, food and education."</TE>
<TE>   International efforts to resolve the crisis have included a pledge of
British funds for land reform in return for Mugabe's agreement to end the
farm invasions.</TE>
<TE>   Tsvangirai, who campaigned on issues of good governance and economic
recovery, has promised a land commission to review the farms listed for
confiscation. His party's campaign manifesto pledges that 7 million
hectares, or 17.3 million acres, will be distributed to landless blacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Land reform in Zimbabwe is an unfinished national agenda," the MDC
leader has said. "Our goal is to resettle people in a way that ensures
that the resettled people produce lots of food to fight poverty and
starvation."</TE>
<TE>Mugabe Vows to Press Ahead With Program</TE>
<TE>   But Mugabe has accused Tsvangirai of trying to recolonize Zimbabwe by
ensuring that the country's prime farmland remains in the hand of whites.
Despite Western opposition, the president has promised to push forward
with the program of seizing farms, calling it "the last phase of the
liberation struggle."</TE>
<TE>   His message has resonated among many Zimbabweans such as the
Mhemberes, who were allocated land from a sprawling farm called Three
Sisters, near the town of Mvurwi in Mazowe district. The property had
belonged to one farmer. Now, 102 families, 20% of them war veterans, have
been resettled there. Each family received six hectares of arable land
and another six hectares to live on within a communal settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "We never used to have a single black farmer here," said Hukuimwe, the
district official. "All these years, we were abandoned to those hilly
areas where nothing used to grow."</TE>
<TE>   A retired police officer, Stepford Musinake now cultivates maize,
groundnuts, beans and sugar on his plot at Three Sisters. He hopes to
sell enough of his crops to acquire more land so that he can try his hand
at growing cotton and soybeans.</TE>
<TE>   Although a drought that has devastated much of southern Africa has
stunted his crops this year, Musinake and his family are living off last
season's bounty--he reaped 550 pounds of beans and 12 tons of maize--and
say they are even assisting others.</TE>
<TE>   "Life is much better today," said Musinake, 51, a father of seven, who
acquired his plot in November 2000. "I have never been to a supermarket
to fetch a packet of mealy meal [made from ground maize] or a packet of
beans. That's why we support land reform and we are behind our president
on this issue."</TE>
<TE>   Owen Chinogurei said growing his own crops on his own land has given
him an unprecedented sense of independence and self-worth.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very happy, because now I am free," said Chinogurei, 54, an
electrician by trade who always had aspirations to farm. "All I have to
do is plan what I want to do. And even if I don't use the land, it's
still mine. [Whites] have had their time. It's enough. They should now
leave things to us."</TE>
<TE>   Critics charge that the government has been rewarding party loyalists
and politicians with land grants at the expense of those who are really
in need. They also argue that without proper support, such as fertilizer,
which is in short supply, and with no farm experience, the new landowners
will never produce enough food for an increasingly hungry nation.</TE>
<TE>   Kossam Mutsinze is determined to prove them wrong. A former war
veteran and Foreign Affairs Ministry employee who became a commercial
farmer in the nearby town of Concession, he is confident that hard work,
increased government assistance and sufficient rainfall will help him
prosper.</TE>
<TE>   These factors made success easy last year when he reaped 1,200 tons of
maize and 150 tons of soybeans from about 500 acres of land. Profits from
that harvest have allowed him to build a sprawling home and stockpile
sacks of grain to see him and his 10 workers through this year's drought.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of land reform reject assertions that Zimbabwe's
agricultural industry would collapse if left in the hands of blacks,
calling such pronouncements racist.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen a white man holding a hoe or weeding a field," said
Hukuimwe, the local government officer. "We have been doing the job for
years, so we have nothing to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Mutsinze said Mugabe was "bold" for tackling the land issue at the
risk of being shunned by the West--and to the chagrin of Zimbabwe's white
minority.</TE>
<TE>   "They are saying that we are robbing them [of their land]," he said.
"But we are saying, we are taking back what already belongs to us."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Works Up Plan for Using Nuclear Arms</HD>
<DH>Military: Administration, in a secret report, calls for a strategy
against at least seven nations: China, Russia, Iraq, Iran, North Korea,
Libya and Syria.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has directed the military to prepare
contingency plans to use nuclear weapons against at least seven countries
and to build smaller nuclear weapons for use in certain battlefield
situations, according to a classified Pentagon report obtained by the Los
Angeles Times.</LD>
<LD>   The secret report, which was provided to Congress on Jan. 8, says the
Pentagon needs to be prepared to use nuclear weapons against China,
Russia, Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Libya and Syria. It says the weapons
could be used in three types of situations: against targets able to
withstand nonnuclear attack; in retaliation for attack with nuclear,
biological or chemical weapons; or "in the event of surprising military
developments."</LD>
<LD>   A copy of the report was obtained by defense analyst and Times
contributor William Arkin. His column on the contents appears in Sunday's
editions.</LD>
<TE>   Officials have long acknowledged that they had detailed nuclear plans
for an attack on Russia. However, this "Nuclear Posture Review"
apparently marks the first time that an official list of potential target
countries has come to light, analysts said. Some predicted the disclosure
would set off strong reactions from governments of the target countries.</TE>
<TE>   "This is dynamite," said Joseph Cirincione, a nuclear arms expert at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. "I can
imagine what these countries are going to be saying at the U.N." Arms
control advocates said the report's directives on development of smaller
nuclear weapons could signal that the Bush administration is more willing
to overlook a long-standing taboo against the use of nuclear weapons
except as a last resort. They warned that such moves could dangerously
destabilize the world by encouraging other countries to believe that
they, too, should develop weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying desperately to find new uses for nuclear weapons, when
their uses should be limited to deterrence," said John Isaacs, president
of the Council for a Livable World. "This is very, very dangerous talk .
. . Dr. Strangelove is clearly still alive in the Pentagon."</TE>
<TE>   But some conservative analysts insisted that the Pentagon must prepare
for all possible contingencies, especially now, when dozens of countries,
and some terrorist groups, are engaged in secret weapon development
programs.</TE>
<TE>   They argued that smaller weapons have an important deterrent role
because many aggressors might not believe that the U.S. forces would use
multi-kiloton weapons that would wreak devastation on surrounding
territory and friendly populations.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have a credible deterrence against regimes involved in
international terrorism and development of weapons of mass destruction,"
said Jack Spencer, a defense analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation in Washington. He said the contents of the report did not
surprise him and represent "the right way to develop a nuclear posture
for a post-Cold War world."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Pentagon, Richard McGraw, declined to comment
because the document is classified.</TE>
<TE>   Congress requested the reassessment of the U.S. nuclear posture in
September 2000. The last such review was conducted in 1994 by the Clinton
administration. The new report, signed by Secretary of Defense Donald H.
Rumsfeld, is now being used by the U.S. Strategic Command to prepare a
nuclear war plan.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials have publicly provided only sketchy
details of the nuclear review. They have publicly emphasized the parts of
the policy suggesting that the administration wants to reduce reliance on
nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Clinton administration's review is also classified, no
specific contrast can be drawn. However, analysts portrayed this report
as representing a break with earlier policy.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. policymakers have generally indicated that the United States
would not use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear states unless they were
allied with nuclear powers. They have left some ambiguity about whether
the United States would use nuclear weapons in retaliation after strikes
with chemical or nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The report says the Pentagon should be prepared to use nuclear weapons
in an Arab-Israeli conflict, in a war between China and Taiwan, or in an
attack from North Korea on the south. They might also become necessary in
an attack by Iraq on Israel or another neighbor, it said.</TE>
<TE>   The report says Russia is no longer officially an "enemy." Yet it
acknowledges that the huge Russian arsenal, which includes about 6,000
deployed warheads and perhaps 10,000 smaller "theater" nuclear weapons,
remains of concern.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials have said publicly that they were studying the need
to develop theater nuclear weapons, designed for use against specific
targets on a battlefield, but had not committed themselves to that
course.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have often spoken of the advantages of using nuclear weapons
to destroy the deep tunnel and cave complexes that many regimes have been
building, especially since the Persian Gulf War of 1991. Nuclear weapons
give off powerful shock waves that can crush structures deep in the
Earth, they point out.</TE>
<TE>   Officials argue that large nuclear arms have so many destructive side
effects, from blast to heat and radiation, that they become
"self-deterring." They contend the Pentagon needs "full spectrum
deterrence"--that is, a full range of weapons that potential enemies
believe might be used against them.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon was actively involved in planning for use of tactical
nuclear weapons as recently as the 1970s. But it has moved away from them
in the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the report's reference to "surprising military
developments" referred to the Pentagon's fears that a rogue regime or
terrorist group might suddenly unleash a wholly unknown weapon that was
difficult to counter with the conventional U.S. arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has proposed cutting the offensive nuclear arsenal
by about two-thirds, to between 1,700 and 2,200 missiles, within 10
years. Officials have also said they want to use precision guided
conventional munitions in some missions that might have previously been
accomplished with nuclear arms.</TE>
<TE>   But critics said the report contradicts suggestions the Bush
administration wants to cut the nuclear role.</TE>
<TE>   "This clearly makes nuclear weapons a tool for fighting a war, rather
than deterring them," said Cirincione.</TE>

<HD>A Freed Lifer Just Lets It Go</HD>
<DH>Innocent man holds no hard feelings over his 19 lost years. He's
found faith and become close to the prosecutor and judge who put him
away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The white prison van jerked to a stop on the dusty shoulder of 60th
Street West in Lancaster. A uniformed guard pulled open a side door and
out stepped DeWayne McKinney, a free man after a mistake that took 19
years from his life.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout his 20s and 30s, McKinney had been punished for a crime he
didn't commit.</LD>
<LD>   A few hours earlier, a judge had ordered McKinney released. He did so
at the request of Orange County prosecutors, who said McKinney had been
wrongly convicted of murdering a Burger King manager, and that they now
believed someone else had done the deed.</LD>
<TE>   On the side of the sun-swept road, just outside the gates of the state
prison, McKinney stood frozen. He was scared of the uncertainty,
frightened of freedom. But he would soon find his way, aided by an inner
strength and the unexpected kindness of strangers moved by his story.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney fell in love and married, rekindled a relationship with a son
born shortly after his arrest, and developed new friendships, including a
surprising bond with the judge who sentenced him to life.</TE>
<TE>   He has become a celebrity on the Christian lecture circuit, leaving
congregations in suburban churches spellbound with his soft-spoken
account of keeping the faith. His tale has prompted students at UC Irvine
and Western State University in Fullerton to form "innocence projects"
that are sifting through dusty case files looking for others like him.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after his release, McKinney still can't believe his good
fortune. But thoughts of his new life are always tempered by memories of
his old life, and what he overcame.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, the memories make him shudder. But most of the time, he
said, they give him strength.</TE>
<TE>   "Understanding what you truly lost, it makes you embrace what you
have," said McKinney, now 41. "I'm who I am today because of those 20
years."</TE>
<TE>Confident Police Would Realize Their Mistake</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 17, 1980. He sat in a holding cell in the Orange County Jail,
waiting for police to realize they had made a mistake. An officer had
accosted McKinney outside a friend's apartment complex in Ontario, his
gun pointed at McKinney's chest. "Freeze!" the officer shouted.</TE>
<TE>   At the Ontario police station, McKinney, then 20, learned he was a
suspect in a robbery-murder at a Burger King in Orange six days earlier.
Detectives had a hunch that Los Angeles gang members were responsible,
and they collected dozens of mug shots from the LAPD. A witness was shown
McKinney's picture and said he looked like the gunman.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney was no stranger to the inside of a police station. He grew up
in South-Central Los Angeles and drifted into gang life after his mother
died when he was 12.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney was sent to juvenile hall for cutting a woman with a knife. A
few years later, he and some gang friends were arrested with a gun
outside a jewelry store. He was sent to the California Youth Authority
for attempted robbery.</TE>
<TE>   But this was different. This time he'd done nothing wrong, he told
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies led McKinney into an auditorium for a lineup where he would
be viewed by three witnesses to the murder. McKinney stood among five
other men, each of them wearing black beanies, just as the killer had.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the darkened glass, Burger King workers Richard
Shewbert and Donald Bulla thought they saw something familiar in
McKinney's eyes.</TE>
<TE>   That's him, they told the detectives. No. 3.</TE>
<TE>19 Years' Worth of Laughter and Tears</TE>
<TE>   It was nearly dinner time when McKinney stepped out of the prison van.
He was wearing a pair of Levis and sneakers that were two sizes too
small.</TE>
<TE>   He hitched a ride to Palmdale, where he met Byron Pedersen, a
volunteer prison minister, at a barbecue restaurant. They had become fast
friends at the state prison in Lancaster, where McKinney spent seven
years. Now, they ate ribs and talked.</TE>
<TE>   They laughed and cried and prayed together, and patrons realized they
were witnessing something special. McKinney left the restaurant with a
job offer from the owner.</TE>
<TE>   So much time had passed, McKinney didn't expect anyone to care about
what had happened to him. But nearly everywhere he turned in Orange
County, he found an outstretched hand, a donation, a hot meal.</TE>
<TE>   An investigator for the public defender's office who had worked on his
case let McKinney stay at his house in Costa Mesa for several weeks. A
dentist and doctor treated him for free. A chiropractor gave him an
adjustment, a driving school donated lessons and a Newport Beach bicycle
shop chipped in a 10-speed.</TE>
<TE>   For several weeks, McKinney could be seen wobbling around Costa Mesa
and Newport Beach on that bike, a new cell phone wedged between his ear
and shoulder, living proof that it is possible to forget how to ride a
bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   At the DMV, a clerk recognized McKinney at the back of a long line and
motioned him to the front. "You've waited long enough," the clerk said,
smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of dollars in donations flowed into a trust account
established by the public defender's office. An 11-year-old boy mailed a
crumpled $5 bill. A software company CEO sent $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a different attitude toward the death penalty now. They make
mistakes . . . and he was one of them," said Brian Fargo, former CEO of
Interplay Entertainment in Irvine, a software entertainment company. "I
really empathize with a guy who served 20 years for nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Often, people who met McKinney walked away surprised. He spoke not of
bitterness, but of gratitude. More than once, he said he believed God may
have wanted him in prison all those years, instead of on the streets. "I
lost a lot, but I also gained," McKinney said.</TE>
<TE>   He received numerous job offers and accepted one at UC Irvine, running
audiovisual equipment in lecture halls.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and family worried about whether McKinney, an African American
with inner-city roots, would fit in in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "That surprised me [that] he would live there, the place that actually
sent him where he was for 20 years," said his sister, Brenda Dennis of
Gray, Tenn. "He said he doesn't have any grudges."</TE>
<TE>   Some of McKinney's new friends worried more about whether he would be
able to handle freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, knowing everything I knew about men getting out of
prison, I was very apprehensive. I did think it could go either way. I
thought it was a make-or-break thing," said Nancy Clark, an addiction
counselor who let McKinney live rent-free for several months in a Costa
Mesa apartment. "We're talking about a guy who came out of prison without
a pair of socks or anything. He didn't have a toothbrush."</TE>
<TE>Attempts to Prove Innocence Thwarted</TE>
<TE>   The gunman entered the Burger King around closing time on Dec. 11,
1980. He jumped a counter and forced several employees into a walk-in
refrigerator. Then he shot manager Walter Horace Bell, 19, in the back of
the head.</TE>
<TE>   At McKinney's trial in 1982, four Burger King employees identified him
as the killer. McKinney and several relatives insisted he was at his
sister's home, 20 miles away, at the time. The jury convicted him of
first-degree murder. The prosecution demanded the death penalty, but the
judge sentenced McKinney to life in prison without parole.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney remained adamant about his innocence. Hoping to clear his
name, he took a lie detector test arranged by his public defenders. But
the polygraph examiner found evidence of deception in some of McKinney's
answers.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney also told his lawyers that two prisoners he had encountered
at the Orange County Jail could vouch for his innocence. The prisoners
told McKinney that they took part in the Burger King robbery and knew the
identity of the gunman. McKinney's lawyers investigated but were
skeptical of the prisoners' accounts. They considered the case closed.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney tried to think of prison as a haven from the violence of the
streets. But life on the cellblock was also fraught with danger. Gang
rivalries flourished. McKinney's focus was survival.</TE>
<TE>   He told himself that, one day, someone would correct this mistake. He
tried to block out the reality by reading western novels by Louis
L'Amour, which he collected in swaps with other inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Five years into his life term, McKinney was living among hostile Crips
gang members at San Quentin, one of five prisons where he served time. He
was on the notorious east block. The inmates, not the guards, seemed to
be in control. McKinney strapped magazines to his chest with torn bed
sheets to protect against a stabbing.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney had already survived two knifings, one in a courthouse
holding cell in Orange County, the other at the state prison in Folsom.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in 1987, he sat on his cell toilet, pressed a double-edge razor
against his left wrist, and cut himself again and again. He thought he'd
either die or be moved to a safer cellblock.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney's wrist was bandaged in the infirmary and he was placed in an
isolated cell, under suicide watch. For once, he felt safe. There were no
other inmates to worry about. But when his wounds healed, he was sent
back to the east block.</TE>
<TE>Reunited With a Son Who'd Become a Man</TE>
<TE>   A few days after his release on Jan. 28, 2000, McKinney walked
cautiously through an apartment courtyard in a working-class neighborhood
of Fontana. He rapped a wooden door softly, then waited for the moment
he'd dreamed of for so many years.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Dozier, now 19, was born a few months after his father's
arrest and was given his mother's last name.</TE>
<TE>   During the early years, Anthony and his mother visited McKinney
several times a year. But eventually, McKinney told Anthony's mother to
stop bringing him to prison. He urged her to find a strong man to marry,
someone who could be a role model for his son. Marie Dozier did as
McKinney asked. She married another man, and when Anthony entered his
teens she cut off his visits to prison.</TE>
<TE>   Now, McKinney was standing nervously outside his son's front door, not
sure what kind of reception to expect.</TE>
<TE>   The door swung open and Anthony emerged, beaming. Father and son
embraced.</TE>
<TE>   "How you doing, Daddy?" said the son.</TE>
<TE>   The pair took a long walk, beginning a father-son bond nearly two
decades late.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney decided to take the relationship slowly. Two or three times a
month, McKinney drove to Fontana to visit Anthony. He'd take his son to
the few places he knew in Orange County. They played video games in an
arcade on Balboa Island, shopped for clothes at Triangle Square, spent an
afternoon riding Jet Skis. He wanted to teach Anthony, who works at a
Fontana pizza parlor, that there's life outside his tough neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest part is we've become more than strangers. We're father
and son. That's the greatest part, how we evolved," McKinney said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been cool," Anthony said. "We talk about guy stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Anthony's girlfriend gave birth to their child. On
a recent Saturday night, McKinney spent the evening putting together a
playpen for his grandson. It was a perfect night, the kind he wished he
could have spent with Anthony.</TE>
<TE>Speaking About an 'Unspeakable Situation'</TE>
<TE>   After 19 years in prison, so many things surprised McKinney: automated
teller machines, the Internet, cell phones, self-serve soft drink
dispensers.</TE>
<TE>   But few things amazed him as much as the interest of strangers in
hearing his story.</TE>
<TE>   Within two days of his release, McKinney was summoned to the front of
a crowded Lancaster church hall. He held a microphone and spoke softly
about a jailhouse conversion to Christianity and the faith that sustained
him all those years.</TE>
<TE>   "I was placed in an unspeakable situation for something I didn't do,"
he began. "Two years ago, I met God. I realized there's nothing he can't
do as long as we believe. If I trust in him, he can take me anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   By the time McKinney finished, the crowd of more than 500 was on its
feet, many of them moved to tears by his forgiving demeanor and tale of
rewarded faith.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't see any resentment there. That's what touched people the
most," said Dave DeBose, who was in the audience that day at Desert
Vineyard Christian Fellowship. "For a long time after that, people were
inquiring about DeWayne."</TE>
<TE>   McKinney was invited to speak to law students, college classes and
more church services than he can remember. He was honored by Death
Penalty Focus, a group opposed to capital punishment, at a reception in
Santa Monica where he mingled with the casts of "The West Wing" and "The
Practice" and with singer Jackson Browne.</TE>
<TE>   "He touched everybody in the house. His simple decency is what came
through," said actor Mike Farrell, a death-penalty opponent. "This is a
man whose simple presentation of the facts is a nail in the coffin of
this whole idea that our system is infallible."</TE>
<TE>   McKinney's road to freedom began in 1997. While in the Lancaster
prison, he bumped into one of the two inmates who, in the Orange County
Jail 16 years earlier, had told McKinney that they were involved in the
Burger King robbery and knew who the gunman was. McKinney's original
public defenders had dismissed the prisoners' story.</TE>
<TE>   Now, McKinney asked the inmate to write a sworn statement explaining
that McKinney wasn't involved in the crime and naming the real killer.
McKinney mailed the statement to the public defender's office, where it
piqued the    interest of a new set of attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Public defender's investigators soon tracked down the second prisoner,
who told them that he was the getaway driver that night. Both
prisoners--behind bars for crimes unrelated to the
robbery-killing--implicated a career criminal as the Burger King gunman.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators also interviewed two witnesses whose testimony had
helped convict McKinney in 1982. After viewing a photo of the man
identified by the prisoners, both witnesses said that he--not
McKinney--was the gunman.</TE>
<TE>   The public defender filed a motion for a new trial. The district
attorney's office initially objected, but after their own review of the
case, prosecutors said they would seek McKinney's immediate release.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement was made by Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas, who as a deputy D.A. in 1982 had asked a jury to give
McKinney the death penalty. A judge threw out the conviction and ordered
McKinney freed.</TE>
<TE>   The newly identified suspect has served time for cocaine possession,
burglary and fraud. Prosecutors said they do not have enough evidence to
bring charges against him for the Burger King slaying. The two prisoners
who implicated the suspect have never been prosecuted for their roles in
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney has sued the Orange Police Department and his original
lawyers. But he insists he harbors no bitterness toward anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, McKinney met with Rackauckas and announced his support for
the district attorney's reelection. He said he respected Rackauckas for
seeking his release rather than demanding a new trial, which could have
prolonged McKinney's imprisonment by several years.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks after his release, McKinney was waiting in line in a
coffee house near Costa Mesa's Triangle Square shopping center. An older
man walked in, his tie loosened and face creased with a smile. The last
time McKinney saw Judge David O. Carter, Carter was sending him to prison
for life. This day, the judge had a different message.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone in the system owes you an apology," Carter said with tears in
his eyes. "We're sorry.'</TE>
<TE>   It was the beginning of an unexpected friendship. A few weeks later,
Carter invited McKinney to speak to a church group and to students in a
college class he teaches. The students were moved, Carter recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a powerful statement about finding peace, solace and
stability in the darkest moment of our lives," said Carter, now a federal
judge. "Because when you meet him, he's one of those people who's living
what he believes. You can see it and you can feel it. If he has
bitterness, it's not something that he wears on his sleeve. That's the
very quality that makes people believe in the new DeWayne McKinney."</TE>
<TE>Unlikely Romance Blooms Into Marriage</TE>
<TE>   A few months after his release, McKinney met a woman through friends
at his Costa Mesa apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   They sat in a friend's garage office and talked. She told him about
the places she'd visited. He told her about his years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   To friends, their romance seemed unlikely. Jeanine Clinard practices
Buddhism. McKinney is a devout Christian. But something clicked. She had
a way of teaching McKinney how things work on the outside without making
him feel awkward.</TE>
<TE>   On Christmas Day 2000, McKinney gave Jeanine a box the size of a
television. Inside, she found a diamond engagement ring. Last spring, at
a small chapel in Las Vegas, they were married.</TE>
<TE>   They live in an apartment near South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. They
struggle to pay the rent, buy groceries, make car payments.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't trip on those things," McKinney said. "Every morning is a
blessing. Every morning when I go outside and I hit the air, I'm
thankful."</TE>
<TE>   Because they work different hours, McKinney often spends his evenings
alone at their apartment. He'll exercise at the apartment complex gym,
then soak in the Jacuzzi under the night sky.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and the stars, you can't beat that. Every night I sit in it, I
just thank the Lord.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still beyond belief that I regained my freedom," he said. "I'm
still amazed that I'm back."</TE>

<LD>A brochure touts the housing development as "Pure American."</LD>
<LD>   The interior of one model home looks like it was ripped from a Pottery
Barn catalog. On the shelves are volumes of Encyclopaedia Britannica and
novels by Tom Clancy, James Michener and Judy Blume. A framed photo shows
a couple laughing on their wedding day. Another is of Andy Griffith with
Opie by his side. In the recreation room, the board game Sorry lies open
on a table.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   No, not that Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   This is Orange County, China.</TE>
<TE>   An hour's drive from the heart of Beijing, a Chinese developer,
working with a Newport Beach architect and Orange County designers, is
capitalizing on what may become the world's largest housing market in an
era of rapid economic reform in China.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to create a whole environment that was in the American
style," said Yao Wang, the developer's representative in Los Angeles.
"Sunshine. Palm trees. Make people feel good."</TE>
<TE>   What's being built offers more than a window onto China's booming
housing construction market. It's a recognition of cultural changes,
fueled by money, that are sweeping China and creating a new upwardly
mobile class with an appetite for all things Western.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese Dream, in this case, looks a lot like the American Dream,
down to its last master-planned, manicured, marbled and guard-gated
detail.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the Orange County of stereotype and fable.</TE>
<TE>   At a cost of nearly $60 million, China's Orange County is taking root
a few miles from the site of the 2008 Summer Olympics. When completed,
the collection of $250,000 townhomes and million-dollar-plus luxury
estates will be accompanied by shops, a community center and a man-made
lake.</TE>
<TE>   It's a place that captured the imagination of Xiao Qingchun.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, after returning from New York, the 26-year-old documentary
filmmaker checked out China's Orange County. He was enamored of the
spacious layout of the homes, the luxury touches.</TE>
<TE>   The next day he bought the only unsold property at the time--a
$300,000 model home, fully decorated and furnished.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very American," Xiao said. "It's designed by an American firm
and its materials were imported from America and its furniture was
imported from America. . . . I could never have decorated it so well
myself."</TE>
<TE>   Xiao is willing to voice what usually is politely unsaid in such gated
enclaves in America: That the advantage of his new neighborhood lies in
its being set apart from the lower orders. In a society once billed as a
workers' paradise, fulfillment now comes from being separated from the
masses.</TE>
<TE>   Catering to that desire is Zhang Bo, the 39-year-old Beijing real
estate mogul behind the development, which rises incongruously amid farm
fields north of the nation's capital.</TE>
<TE>American Homes Show Owner Has Arrived</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Zhang visited his friend Yao Wang, who runs an export
business from the cramped back room of his wife's Wilshire Boulevard art
gallery. The two were driving around Orange County, Calif., when Zhang
had an epiphany: These are the kind of homes that professional Chinese
would want. Not another sterile high-rise apartment, but a real American
home that, in its design and materials, exclaimed that its owner had
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "This was risky," Wang said. "When we started this project, we didn't
hire a consulting firm to do market research, like you do here. . . . We
didn't know who would buy this home. We just wanted to do it as quick as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   Zhang instructed Wang to find him an American architect. Wang wrote
letters to dozens of firms. Only a few bothered to respond.</TE>
<TE>   "I had money I wanted to give to them. But they didn't call back. They
didn't want the money," Wang said. "That's weird."</TE>
<TE>   One who did call back was the award-winning Newport Beach
architectural firm Bassenian Lagoni. Aram Bassenian is among a group of
Orange County architects regarded as pioneers in refining, beginning in
the 1960s, what many think of today as the typical upscale suburban home.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County has been the Detroit of the housing industry. It's
where a lot of new ideas have sprung from," Bassenian said of such
features as open floor plans, sprawling kitchens and soaring ceilings.
"We export design."</TE>
<TE>   Bassenian also had experience overseas, working on projects in
Indonesia, Thailand and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   China, however, offered a wider cultural divide.</TE>
<TE>   "We live better than they do. . . . They want that. . . . The dream as
represented in a California house is infectious," Bassenian said. "It's a
huge leap forward."</TE>
<TE>   The developers of China's Orange County boast that their project is
the first Chinese community entirely master-planned and designed by
Americans, using mostly American products. It's also, perhaps, the first
development to so blatantly market itself as American--and therefore
superior to what's dreamed up locally.</TE>
<TE>   All 143 units of the first phase were snatched up within a month of
going on sale, based on floor plans alone. The Beijing media dubbed it
the "Orange storm."</TE>
<TE>   Brochures for the development are full of Anglo faces celebrating the
"suburb obsession." Some of the homes pictured are stock photos of Aliso
Viejo and Coto de Caza.</TE>
<TE>   "Flown over fresh to Beijing," one brochure promises.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang toured housing developments from New York to Miami to Las Vegas.
There, he discovered basement recreation rooms, central heating systems,
wine cellars, built-in backyard barbecues and the concept of model
homes--all largely foreign ideas in China.</TE>
<TE>   "It's everything we take for granted," architect Jeffrey LaFetra said.
"I had no idea what to expect going in."</TE>
<TE>   Plans had to incorporate feng shui, the ancient art of placing things
to ensure a harmonious energy flow. Bedrooms needed to face south to
catch the sun. Stairways couldn't be visible from the front entrance, and
those doors couldn't directly face the street.</TE>
<TE>   "The orientation of the house is most important to me," said home
buyer Xiao Qingchun. "I had a friend check the feng shui for me, and he
said it had good feng shui."</TE>
<TE>'Wall Kitchen' Among Chinese Features</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most Chinese of all, each home has a "wall kitchen" alongside
an expansive American-style cooking area decked out with custom tiles,
granite counters and polished brass fixtures. It's a small cubicle with a
window, a couple of stove-top burners and a fan powerful enough to suck
up the smell of Chinese cooking.</TE>
<TE>   "Chinese people are used to stir-frying, and the smell of oil and
smoke is heavy," said Weighdoon Yang, the development company's vice
president. "It can get into the furniture."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, suburban developments have popped up across China.
Some market themselves as having "German" or "Australian" flavor. A few
advertise themselves as authentically American.</TE>
<TE>   But where most of the older gated compounds catered to expatriates,
the newer crop is aimed squarely at China's nouveau riche, still a
minority in this mostly rural country where the per capita income is
$1,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I had two requirements," Yang said of the project. "From the
perspective of taste, it was designed to appeal to women. Functionally,
it's designed for lazy people," meaning the homes are equipped with
everything from high-tech climate controls to broadband Internet
connections.</TE>
<TE>   Yang said all of Orange County's buyers are native Chinese. More than
20% have, like Xiao, lived abroad. More than 90% are buying second homes.
Their ranks include entrepreneurs and business executives, artists and a
show-biz celebrity or two.</TE>
<TE>   After the Communist takeover of China in 1949, the party became
everyone's landlord. In 1998, China unveiled its "housing reform,"
encouraged individual home ownership and expanded the availability of
mortgages, although financing remains a novelty.</TE>
<TE>   This and other economic freedoms have ushered in a new way of life for
many urban Chinese. On Friday, the state-run China Information News
reported that $65.2 billion was invested last year in housing
construction, up 18.6% from 2000. Some 250,000 home-remodeling and design
companies employ 8.5 million people, the government-run Economic Daily
reported last December.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging the business potential, the U.S. National Assn. of Home
Builders held its second international conference in China last year.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 200 million potential customers for single-family housing
in China," said Katalin Vaughan, executive director of international
affairs for the group. "It's huge. The question is whether it's a market
for Americans, or the rest of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "The competition is extremely high," she said, noting that German,
Canadian and Scandinavian home builders all have eyes on China. "The
typical American builder is very hesitant to go overseas. The American
building market has been so good to them. And, of course, there are risks
involved with China. It's a different culture."</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Debra Newell.</TE>
<TE>Interior Designer Cites 'Very Bad Experience'</TE>
<TE>   Newell, president of Ambrosia Interior Design in Tustin, was hired to
decorate and furnish Orange County's model homes. After four months in
which her team of 10 designers logged 2,000 hours--twice what she
anticipated--Newell says she would never do it again.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very bad experience for us," she said. "They'd yell at us,
scream at us, demand things and say we couldn't leave the country . . .

<TE>   "They expected us to work 14-, 16-hour days," she added. "They had
some of my designers in tears."</TE>
<TE>   Newell, who charged per square foot, not by the hour, says her firm
was roped into doing far more than interior design--scouring the Chinese
countryside for granite and designing the wood baseboards, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to fly there and show them how to lay the carpet," said
Newell, who claims she still is owed $15,000 from the developer. "Also,
as a woman, I was treated differently than I am here.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they see us as being spoiled."</TE>
<TE>   Yang said he was satisfied with Ambrosia's work and denied that anyone
with his company ever yelled at Newell's employees or threatened to keep
them from leaving China.</TE>
<TE>   "We asked Ambrosia to revise some of their plans during their
presentations, and we thought they would revise them before they came
here," he said. "It turned out they did not change the original designs,
so we had to spend some time discussing that in Beijing. They also asked
us to pay for those extra hours, which we refused."</TE>
<TE>Architects 'Treated Like Celebrities'</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the architects from Bassenian couldn't have been happier
with their experience. They've since been contacted by other Chinese
developers looking to forge a similar partnership.</TE>
<TE>   "We were treated like celebrities," LaFetra said.</TE>
<TE>   At Orange County's grand opening, visitors wore plastic booties over
their shoes when they toured the model homes. Media covered the event.
The U.S. and Canadian embassies were represented. Everyone dined on
cheeseburgers from McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   The project's second phase is to be completed by August 2003. It's a
collection of mansions in Spanish, Italian and French styles. The Wenyu
River runs nearby.</TE>
<TE>   It's the real luxury stuff. To stir the imagination, the developer has
gone back to America for a name.</TE>

<HD>Push for Iraq Inspectors Off to 'Good Start'</HD>
<DH>Talks: U.N. diplomats say Baghdad is signaling a new willingness to
admit weapons monitors. U.S. officials, however, remain highly skeptical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>Iraq is signaling a seeming new willingness to admit international
weapons inspectors, foreign diplomats and U.N. officials said Friday
after a closed-door review of the previous day's meeting here between
Iraq's foreign minister and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</LD>
<LD>   But U.S. officials said they remain highly skeptical of Iraq's
intentions, despite what all sides described as an unexpectedly cordial
and "constructive" exchange here Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In nearly four hours of talks in his office, the Iraqi delegation
raised legal and logistical questions about compliance with U.N. demands,
but in contrast to previous meetings did not object to the inspections in
principle, Annan told the Security Council. Iraq's concerns were posed as
"questions," not "preconditions," Annan said Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "We are at a very early stage, so we should not claim success or
failure yet," Annan cautioned in remarks to reporters later. "We are at a
very, very early beginning. But it was a good start." Annan agreed to
meet again with the Iraqis next month.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and Britain--Iraq's two unrelenting adversaries on
the council, with jet fighters patrolling Iraqi airspace and officials
calling openly for President Saddam Hussein's ouster--took pains to
endorse Annan's decision to continue talks with Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "We support his effort to conduct this dialogue," said James B.
Cunningham, the deputy U.S. representative to the U.N. "He kept the focus
where it should be properly, which is on . . . the need to implement the
resolutions."</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. does not foresee an imminent Iraqi turnaround, Cunningham
indicated, noting that the Iraqis discussed but did not agree to terms
for arms inspections in their meeting with Annan. "He did not get a
positive response from the Iraqis," Cunningham said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Greenstock, the British ambassador here, had a markedly more
optimistic reading of the talks. "We are approaching the stage where we
both have an inspection team ready to go and when we seem to have the
beginnings of an indication that they may indeed be welcome," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hans Blix, the Swedish head of the U.N. weapons inspection unit that
would travel to Iraq, who also participated in Thursday's talks, told the
council that his team would be ready to begin work on short notice. Since
being established at the end of 1999, the U.N. Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission, or UNMOVIC, has maintained a small management
team in New York while recruiting and training more than 200 specialists
in chemical, biological and nuclear weaponry who could serve as
inspectors. The commission is still contracting consultants on a standby
basis, Blix said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said he pledged to the Iraqis that his team would be politically
independent and technically objective in its assessments of their arms
programs. Blix told the Iraqis that, unlike the previous U.N. inspections
unit, his commission and its employees work directly and exclusively for
the U.N., with funds from U.N.-monitored Iraqi oil revenues. Iraq had
charged that previous U.N. inspectors were also working for Western
intelligence services, and U.S. officials later conceded that the
accusation was true.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei V. Lavrov, Russia's ambassador to the U.N., said this week's
meeting could be "a first step" toward Iraqi compliance with U.N.
demands. But he reiterated Russian demands that the Security Council set
out more precise terms for judging Iraqi compliance and removing economic
penalties, including the U.N.'s collection of Iraqi oil income.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to specify criteria and time frames for the suspension of
sanctions, including the trigger," Lavrov said. "The trigger should be
UNMOVIC, and not some value judgment by one or two members of the
council."</TE>
<TE>   American diplomats said this dispute is likely to remain academic, as
they are convinced that Hussein will continue to spurn inspections
because Iraq is still illegally developing weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials believe that it was only the threat of U.S. military
action that brought Iraq to the U.N. this week, a view shared by many
Western diplomats and U.N. officials who nonetheless oppose such action.
Should inspectors find that Iraq is in fact building or storing nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons, that would provide legal and political
support for U.S. military strikes, current and former U.S. diplomats
note.</TE>
<TE>   "From our point of view, we have already delayed far too long,"
Cunningham said. "Iraq should have complied a long time ago, and
inspectors should already be back in."</TE>

<HD>Post-Taliban Kabul Marks International Women's Day</HD>
<DH>Celebration: Hundreds of Afghans gather for the first such
observance in years. Interim leader Karzai pledges $500,000 to support
new ministry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The movie theater where they gathered had been burned by the
Taliban. Its roof was jury-rigged out of red-and-white parachute cloth.
The guests had to sit on new folding chairs still partially wrapped in
plastic.</LD>
<LD>   But that only added to the up-from-the-ashes charm Friday as hundreds
of Afghan women and a raft of international dignitaries gathered for the
first observance of International Women's Day in Afghanistan since before
the Taliban came to power. They bade a cheerful good riddance to a regime
that kept women and girls out of school, in the home and under
burkas--all on pain of beating, prison or death.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of cowering and running from enforcers for the Ministry for
the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, women with heads held
high strode purposefully past soldiers into the Zainab theater and took
their places in the front.</LD>
<TE>   There was nary a burka in sight at the ceremony, attended by interim
Prime Minister Hamid Karzai and much of his Cabinet as well as U.N. human
rights chief Mary Robinson. Nevertheless, on the streets of this capital
and in the countryside, virtually all women still wear the
all-encompassing, identity-hiding cloak in public.</TE>
<TE>   At the ceremony, next to Afghan women in colorful head scarves were
female members of the foreign armed forces taking part in the
peacekeeping force in Kabul, dressed in camouflage uniforms and red
berets.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai, in a speech delivered in the Dari language, vowed to improve
the status of women and pledged $500,000 to the country's new Ministry of
Women's Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Women's Day has not been an annual event in Afghanistan since the fall
of the pro-Soviet government in 1992. The moujahedeen who took over held
fundamentalist views, and strictures on women became even more intense
when the Taliban movement conquered Kabul in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Taliban, women were barred from school and jobs outside the
home and could be beaten for daring to lift their burkas off their faces
in public, even if only to better read a price in a market or an address
on a building.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great and historical day," Karzai said Friday. "We are
determined to work to improve the lot of women after all their suffering
under the narrow-minded and oppressive rule of the Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   The first speaker was Karzai's deputy and the minister for women's
affairs, Sima Samar, a doctor who courageously funded and operated
clandestine schools for girls in Afghanistan during the Taliban era
through a nongovernmental organization she founded in neighboring
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   She condemned the Taliban regime as criminal and ignorant and urged
that Afghan women and the international community join hands to improve
the lot of Afghan women. But she also pointed out that Afghanistan
remains an Islamic country and said that its feminism must reflect
Islamic values.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Vows to Keep Up War on Terror</HD>
<DH>Speech: Bush, visiting Florida, warns of more possible casualties
in remarks to a crowd that included families of two soldiers slain in
Afghanistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>A tearful President Bush, speaking to a crowd that included the
families of two soldiers killed in Afghanistan this week, vowed Friday
that the United States would remain "relentless and determined" in
fighting terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   "So long as I'm president, we're going to be after them, without
blinking," he said, while cautioning that more American troops might die
in the effort.</LD>
<LD>   Bush came to St. Petersburg to promote his ideas for post-Enron
corporate responsibility, to praise the economic stimulus bill that
cleared Congress on Friday and to pitch his proposals for volunteerism.</LD>
<TE>   But as he usually does in his public appearances, he first discussed
the war on terrorism. He noted that his audience included relatives of
Army Spc. Marc A. Anderson, 30, and Army Sgt. Bradley S. Crose, 22, two
of the seven Americans killed in intense fighting Monday in eastern
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Visibly moved and fighting back tears, Bush told the relatives: "I
know your heart aches, and we ache for you." But he said the men "died
for a noble and just cause."</TE>
<TE>   The audience responded with a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate it, to know that young soldiers are at risk," the president
said. "But I want to assure you and all those loved ones whose sons and
daughters are at risk, that not only is the cause just and important and
noble, but our United States government will provide the United States
military with whatever it needs to win this war against terror."</TE>
<TE>   Bush is known by his friends to easily show his emotions in private.
But until Friday, he had avoided emotional displays about U.S. military
casualties in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen Americans have been killed in combat or other hostile
situations during the war in Afghanistan. Fifteen Americans have died in
military aircraft crashes or while working in support of the war.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the fighting that broke out last weekend against an
enclave of Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters, Bush said: "We found a bunch of
Al Qaeda killers recently, bunched up in Afghanistan. And our military
went after them, and we're making good progress. It is a sign of what's
going to happen for a while. . . . And we will take loss of life, and I'm
sad for loss of life."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also noted that Monday will mark six months since the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11 that claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said 1,300 people had been invited to the
White House for an event commemorating the date, including members of
Congress, foreign ambassadors and relatives of victims of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld will welcome
military leaders of countries that have helped in the war on terrorism.
And in London, Vice President Dick Cheney will join British Prime
Minister Tony Blair in a ceremony commemorating people from other nations
who died in the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's trip to Florida included a stop at a fund-raiser for the state
Republican Party. The president was the keynote speaker at a lunch
expected to raise $500,000, part of which will be used to help the
reelection campaign of his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks, the president took an obvious swipe at Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who sparked controversy last week when he
said the war in Afghanistan could not be considered a success if the
United States failed to find Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who are preoccupied with one individual do not understand the
struggle," Bush said. "We fight terror wherever terrorism exists, and
those people who say one person matters, they elevate that person to a
status he does not deserve."</TE>
<TE>   The trip was Bush's eighth to Florida since he won the presidency--a
victory that was in dispute until a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court
tilted the state into his column.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Jeb I'll do anything he wants me to do to get him elected,"
the president said. "If he wants me down here, I'm coming back."</TE>

<HD>Complications for Cheney's Mission</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Israeli-Palestinian violence is likely to be a thorny
issue in his upcoming trip to gain Arab support for the war on terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney will embark Sunday on a trip once
envisioned as a mission to garner support for widening the war against
terror, a task made more complicated by the spiral of Middle East
violence.</LD>
<LD>   The dynamics of his trip to Britain and 11 nations in the Middle East
demonstrate an underlying truth that experts agree Cheney will encounter:</LD>
<LD>   Although President Bush is dispatching his vice president to gauge
support for taking the anti-terror campaign beyond Afghanistan, the
moderate Arab states whose support the administration is courting will be
unmoved unless they see the Israelis and Palestinians making progress
toward peace.</LD>
<TE>   The understated Cheney conceded Friday at the White House that "the
trip has taken on, I suppose, a little added significance" as a result of
the unabated violence, which reached new levels Friday when scores of
Palestinians and six Israelis died.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president said, however, that the trip is still largely
driven by the administration's overriding goal of expanding the war
against terror. That, in addition to targeting Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, would include attacking Al Qaeda cells beyond Afghanistan not
only militarily but also through financial restrictions and cooperation
with foreign law enforcement units.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, the vice president said, must "make certain we
don't allow a sanctuary to develop someplace else and become a refuge, if
you will, for the Al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   The trip will take Cheney to Arab nations whose leaders are largely
friendly to U.S. interests but anxious about showing too much support for
Washington's campaign against Hussein while the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict is raging.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth M. Pollack, deputy director of national security studies at
the Council on Foreign Relations think tank and a former Persian Gulf
expert at the National Security Council, described the message Cheney is
likely to hear from his Arab hosts this way:</TE>
<TE>   "Our ability to help you on the war on terrorism and our willingness
to abide by any military move against Iraq is going to be guided by the
status of the Israeli-Palestinian situation because popular opinion would
tolerate neither until Palestinians feel more secure."</TE>
<TE>   The trip is being undertaken in an environment of extreme security
concerns. The vice president's itinerary is not being disclosed in
advance of his arrival in each country.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. options in defusing the Israeli-Palestinian violence appear
few.</TE>
<TE>   A framework exists for bringing the two parties to the negotiating
table. It is the plan put forward by CIA Director George J. Tenet to
establish Israeli-Palestinian cooperation on security issues so that
talks proposed last year by former Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Maine)
toward a final peace arrangement can take place.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Bush said he was sending his special Middle East envoy,
retired Marine Corps Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, back to the region to look
for an opportunity to bring both sides to the table.</TE>
<TE>   But Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's military keeps hammering the
Palestinians, who dispatch suicide bombers and launch other attacks on
Israel. And Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat will not or
cannot rein in extremists.</TE>
<TE>   So, Cheney would appear to have little to offer the Arab leaders in
return for their support against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In the run-up to Cheney's trip, the administration has stiffened its
criticism of Israel. On Friday, U.S. officials demanded an immediate end
to military operations that target Palestinian civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "We strongly oppose the Israeli policy of targeted killing that has
led to the death of many innocent civilians," State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   The glimmer of hope cited by Bush as Cheney and Zinni prepare to
embark separately for the Middle East was provided by a Saudi peace
initiative that calls for Arab recognition of Israel in return for
Israel's withdrawal from territory captured in the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   But that sketchy idea fails to address the details that have mired the
region in bloodshed for decades, and the Bush administration concluded
last year that real peace can't be achieved between the Israelis and
Palestinians as long as their two current leaders are in power.</TE>
<TE>   If that is correct, the most the U.S. could hope for is a cessation of
hostilities--and a cold peace. And even that, after the violence of the
past week, looks difficult to achieve.</TE>

<DL>ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar
</DL>
<LD>Madagascar's opposition seized control of the Defense Ministry on
Friday, gaining support of the military in a dispute over the outcome of
presidential elections more than two months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Opposition leader Marc Ravalomanana declared himself president after
the Dec. 16 elections and organized a series of protests and a strike to
force incumbent President Didier Ratsiraka to step down.</LD>
<LD>   Ratsiraka responded by declaring martial law here in the capital, a
move that was widely ignored. He then moved his government to Toamasina,
an eastern port city.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, 10 people were hurt when a man threw a grenade into a plaza
crowded with opposition supporters in Fianarantsoa, about 160 miles south
of Antananarivo.</TE>
<TE>   The attacker, whom opposition officials identified as a Ratsiraka
supporter, was arrested. Police made no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   With the seizure of the Defense Ministry, Ravalomanana's supporters
have taken control of all government buildings except the prime
minister's office.</TE>
<TE>   There was no comment Friday from Ratsiraka.</TE>

<LD>Wiretap recordings of Helmut Kohl collected by the East German
secret police were sealed by a court, handing the former chancellor a
victory with broad implications for public access to the Communist-era
spy files.</LD>
<LD>   Kohl, whose 16 years in power included the reunification of Germany in
1990, had argued that he was entitled to protection under the law for
victims of the Stasi secret police.</LD>
<LD>   The verdict by the Federal Administrative Court in Berlin means that
the Stasi archive can no longer release files on public figures other
than Stasi collaborators without their consent, said a spokesman for the
archive.</LD>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>An epidemic in western Afghanistan has killed 40 people in two
weeks, and health officials believe that the disease could be either
scurvy or a form of hemorrhagic fever.</LD>
<LD>   Workers for the French nongovernmental organization Action Against
Hunger learned of the illness when they arrived in the village of Tajwara
in late February, Lorie Hieber Girardet of the World Health Organization
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Eighty people reportedly contracted the illness, and half have died,
Girardet said.</LD>
<TE>   There are several kinds of hemorrhagic fever with varying levels of
seriousness ranging from mild illness to death. Ebola is one type.</TE>
<TE>   Three people died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Pakistan,
Afghanistan's eastern neighbor, in late February.</TE>
<TE>   The virus that causes Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is transmitted
by ticks. Infected people can transmit the virus by blood, saliva or
droplets from sneezing.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE
</DL>
<LD>Slobodan Milosevic brandished what he said was an FBI document
concerning Al Qaeda-backed Muslim fighters in Kosovo as he insisted
Friday that ethnic Albanian separatists were the true villains there.</LD>
<LD>   Sparring with a Kosovo human rights activist who accused Serbs,
citizens of Yugoslavia's main republic, of killing and mutilating ethnic
Albanians in the Serbian province, the former Yugoslav president said the
document proved the existence of Al Qaeda and moujahedeen support for
Muslim fighters not only in Kosovo but also in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the
separatist Russian republic of Chechnya.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a congressional statement of the FBI. That's what this is,"
Milosevic declared, adding triumphantly that the report was dated Dec.
18--"after Sept. 11."</LD>
<TE>   The authenticity of the document could not be independently confirmed,
and he gave no details of how he obtained it.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither the [Serbian] army nor the police have been implicated in war
crimes," Milosevic, who is defending himself, told the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in his war crimes trial.</TE>
<TE>   But witness Sabit Kadriu said he knew nothing of activity by Osama bin
Laden in Kosovo, where a Serbian crackdown on ethnic Albanians triggered
North Atlantic Treaty Organization airstrikes in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not true there were moujahedeen in Kosovo. This is a fiction of
your mind," the 41-year-old ethnic Albanian said.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic faces 66 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and war
crimes in Kosovo, Bosnia and Croatia--the latter two onetime Yugoslav
republics.</TE>
<TE>   Kadriu told the court Thursday that Serbian forces killed more than
100 civilians as they tried to flee the province in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Navy SEAL 'Died Doing What Made Me Happy'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before he left for Afghanistan, Navy SEAL Neil C. Roberts wrote a
letter for his wife to open in case he did not return.</LD>
<LD>   "I loved being a SEAL," he wrote. "If I died doing something for the
Teams, then I died doing what made me happy. Very few people have the
luxury of that."</LD>
<LD>   Roberts, 32, a petty officer 1st class from Woodland, Calif., and six
other Americans died Monday after U.S. helicopters were hit by enemy
gunfire in Afghanistan. Roberts fell to the ground as his stricken
helicopter veered up and away. He apparently survived the fall and was
shot on the ground.</LD>
<TE>   The family released a portion of the letter because Roberts' widow,
Patty, wanted to tell people about her husband.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved his country and would want everyone to know that this is how
he would have wanted to go," she said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, who is survived by his wife and 18-month-old son, Nathan,
thanked his family, which includes a twin brother, Galen, 10 other
brothers and sisters, and his mother, Jan, all of whom still live in
Woodland.</TE>
<TE>   "My family is the reason I am the person I am today," he wrote. "They
supported and cared for me in the best way possible."</TE>
<TE>   He also expressed how much being in the Navy meant to him: "Although I
sacrificed personal freedom and many other things, I got just as much as
I gave. My time in the Teams was special. For all the times I was cold,
wet, tired, sore, scared, hungry and angry, I had a blast. The bad was
balanced equally with the good."</TE>

<HD>Purple Hearts for 6 Wounded in Afghan War</HD>
<DH>Military: Ceremony underscores a change in U.S. tactics in which
American troops, not local fighters, take the lead on the front lines.</DH>

<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The six soldiers stood at attention in the old Soviet airplane
hangar Friday to receive Purple Hearts, the medal reserved for Americans
wounded or killed in combat.</LD>
<LD>   One was a helicopter pilot grazed in the head by shrapnel when a
rocket-propelled grenade shattered the cockpit of his aircraft. Others
were infantrymen caught in a terrifying 18-hour mortar assault on the
first day of Operation Anaconda in eastern Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The men were praised for their sacrifice and courage by a phalanx of
generals assembled in the leaky old building, a decrepit remnant of the
last foreign military force to operate in Afghanistan. But the emotional
ceremony also underscored a change in tactics that has put U.S. ground
troops square on the front lines in the war against Al Qaeda and Taliban
forces.</LD>
<TE>   Initially, American commanders had hoped that local Afghan fighters
would take the lead in the attack launched last weekend, with U.S. and
coalition forces assuming blocking positions outside.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the Afghans to go after these guys. It's their country," Maj.
Gen. Frank L. Hagenbeck told reporters in an operation briefing Feb. 26.</TE>
<TE>   But when the Afghan forces proved ineffective and the American
"blockers" came under immediate, intense fire, the plan was quickly
reversed.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Col. Joe Smith, chief of staff for the 10th Mountain
Division here at Bagram air base, said the attack forces were now arrayed
in "concentric circles: Afghan forces on the outside and the rest of
coalition forces on the inside," like an anaconda suffocating its prey.</TE>
<TE>   The results have been striking: According to U.S. commanders, more
than 500 "hardened Al Qaeda fighters" have been killed in six days of
ground fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Ground fire from the Al Qaeda and Taliban holdouts has eased in recent
days, officials said Friday at the Pentagon. But the Pentagon believes
that perhaps 200 fighters are still entrenched in the caves, tunnels and
cliff sides, a senior Pentagon official said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen sporadic firing, sporadic fighting" in the last several
days, said Air Force Brig. Gen. John W. Rosa Jr., deputy director of
operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "The fighting we saw in the
first day has not been as intense. But it's still a very dangerous
place."</TE>
<TE>   Rosa told reporters at the Pentagon that "a couple hundred" Al Qaeda
fighters remain in the mountainous battlefield but said their losses
appear to have reduced their ability to organize defenses.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa said U.S. aircraft, including B-52 bombers, Navy fighter jets,
Apache helicopters and AC-130 gunships, had flown more than 200 missions
Friday and dropped 75 bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he expects the battle would
last seven to 10 more days. On Thursday, he said it could end as early as
this weekend, although in both instances he cautioned that it is
impossible to know how long the militant fighters will hold out.</TE>
<TE>   The battle against the holdouts has come at a high price: It has
resulted in the highest number of U.S. casualties in the Afghan war.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 43 men who landed in the Chinook helicopter with Army Sgt.
David Smith and other members of Charlie Company in the early morning of
March 2, 12 were wounded. So far, eight Americans have died in Operation
Anaconda, with dozens more wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, all of us thought we were going to die," said Smith, of
Philadelphia, a squad team leader whose legs were gashed by a mortar
explosion and who was one of the Purple Heart recipients Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. fighters, set down in what they were told was a secure area,
spent most of the time dragging their fallen comrades to a series of
hiding places to avoid the incoming mortars until more troops transported
by two Black Hawk helicopters came to their aid under cover of night.</TE>
<TE>   Miraculously, none of the Americans were killed. A chaplain at the
Purple Heart ceremony offered a prayer for "keeping the men alive when
death was all around them."</TE>
<TE>   Fewer details are known about the deadliest incident in the operation,
which occurred early Monday morning. Again, a Chinook helicopter loaded
with special operations troops, including Navy SEALs, landed in a
supposedly secure area southwest of the lower Shahi Kot Valley where most
of the fighting has been concentrated. Again, the helicopter immediately
came under fire.</TE>
<TE>   Although the helicopter was hit, its pilot managed to fly the craft
out of the firefight and land safely about four miles north. It was then
that the crew discovered that one man, Navy SEAL Neil Roberts, had fallen
out of the open back ramp of the Chinook, which was slippery with
hydraulic fluid because of the damage.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the tradition of leaving no man behind, another
Chinook, also loaded with special operations forces, returned to the
original landing site.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinook experienced what the military termed a "hard landing," but
most of the troops were able to get out. They encountered a heavy
firefight that resulted in six more American deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Since these early losses, there have been no more deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "We have gained the positional advantage that six days ago belonged to
the Al Qaeda," Col. Frank Wiercinski said. Wiercinski, a brigade
commander who came under fire for several hours in one firefight,
described the ground actions so far as a "mission success."</TE>
<TE>   Morale at the Bagram base, where several thousand Americans are
headquartered, appears extremely high. Those who have been in daytime
fighting are easily identifiable from the heavy sunburn they encountered
in the snowy high-altitude battlegrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the troops had waited several months in the southern city of
Kandahar and the neighboring nation of Uzbekistan for actual combat, and
now it had come.</TE>

<HD>Northern Alliance Troops Trek South</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Tajik soldiers head to Pushtun area to help fight Al
Qaeda forces. Some fear the deployment will heighten ethnic tensions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ON THE ROAD TO GARDEZ, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Sun-bronzed Najmuddin, 23, hefted his trusty Kalashnikov into the
crook of his arm and smiled grimly beneath his pancake woolen hat. "We
are going to Gardez," he said. "I think it will be the last fighting."</LD>
<LD>   He and other Tajik members of the battle-tested Northern Alliance
fighting force, the Panjshir Division, mounted pickup trucks and
Soviet-built tanks Friday and headed south toward the Pushtun belt of
eastern Afghanistan to join the American-led campaign against the Al
Qaeda terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   Their commander, Gen. Gul Hydar, said they were sent by the Defense
Ministry in Kabul, the Afghan capital, presumably to help cut off escape
routes for a collection of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters besieged by the
Americans in the mountains around Shahi Kot, about 25 miles south of
Gardez.</LD>
<TE>   But bringing in troops from the north, rather than using local
recruits, is sure to touch a nerve in this region of prickly tempers.</TE>
<TE>   Hydar, a northerner from the Panjshir Valley who has fought the
Taliban alongside assassinated Northern Alliance military commander Ahmed
Shah Masoud, said he has been appointed overall commander of
Afghanistan's eastern zone, which includes the provinces of Paktia and
Lowgar.</TE>
<TE>   His expedition south was the first time in memory that Tajiks have
left northern Afghanistan to fight on Pushtun territory.</TE>
<TE>   Their presence raised questions: Will the introduction of northern
troops and a northern commander signal a new era of national unity? Or
will it exacerbate existing ethnic and geographic tensions between
Pushtun and Tajik?</TE>
<TE>   Cloudy, windy and wet weather was whipping through the soaring peaks
and deep valleys of Paktia province, where U.S. troops have been fighting
entrenched Taliban and Al Qaeda supporters for a week. The movement of
troops from Kabul will provide valuable reinforcements against an
opponent that has put up much greater resistance than expected.</TE>
<TE>   People in Gardez say the forces fighting the Americans are being led
by a prominent local commander, Mullah Saifur Rahman Mansour, who remains
popular with at least some of the people around Gardez and his hometown
of Zormat.</TE>
<TE>   Tribal leaders in Paktia have sometimes seemed ambivalent about how
much to help the Americans in their quest to hunt down remnants of the
Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. However, the northerners are committed to
wiping out these fighters, their longtime enemies.</TE>
<TE>   "I am happy that they will be removed because they have brought only
disaster to this country," said Lt. Col. Mir Padshah, 37, who was
operating one of the old Soviet tanks. His hair already graying, he said
that he has been at war for most of the last 22 years.</TE>
<TE>   The slow-moving column of about 1,000 troops, including tanks and
truck-borne rockets, headed out of Kabul at 6 a.m. Friday, and all of its
elements were expected to be in Gardez by early today.</TE>
<TE>   Their arrival will double the size of the Afghan contingent available
to fight alongside more than 1,000 American and other coalition troops,
who are battling enemies holed up in caves and bunkers.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces are at the forefront of the fighting but have been relying
on Afghan allies to seal off escape routes and stop supporters of the
Taliban from infiltrating the area to help their comrades.</TE>
<TE>   A young man in Gardez, who asked that his name not be used, said the
arrival of troops from Panjshir would be unsettling for the town, which
is predominantly Pushtun.</TE>
<TE>   "People think this is a step toward settling old scores," he said.
"People are thinking that the Panjshiris are coming to take revenge on
the Pushtuns."</TE>
<TE>   Hydar, interviewed on the roadside where he sat on his haunches with
top aides, dismissed the notion that the arrival of his troops should
cause resentment or fear.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not only Panjshir people that I have with me. We have some from
Lowgar and other provinces," he said. "This army is sent by the national
Defense Ministry. So it is not a question of Panjshiris or Pushtuns any
longer. It is now a matter of a national army."</TE>
<TE>   Hydar said regional military commanders met Friday with the defense
minister and pledged that every region would contribute troops for the
national defense.</TE>
<TE>   "They agreed that when the defense minister calls, all provinces would
provide as many soldiers as needed to get rid of the Al Qaeda, who have
been killing our people," Hydar said. Thus his initial force could easily
be increased, depending on the circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God that the Al Qaeda finally will be eradicated and removed,"
Hydar said, just before ordering his column to move forward. "It has been
proven that they occupied our country by force."</TE>
<TE>   If there are any Afghan Taliban troops fighting in Paktia, they should
be treated the same as Al Qaeda fighters, he said. "Whoever joins them is
a terrorist too."</TE>

<HD>GOP's Thompson to Retire, Sending Parties Scrambling</HD>
<DH>Politics: The Tennessee senator's decision complicates Republican
efforts to regain control of the Senate. Democrats see a key opening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) abruptly canceled a reelection bid
Friday, dealing a blow to GOP hopes of retaking the Senate and prompting
a hunt by both parties for candidates to replace the folksy political
maverick.</LD>
<LD>   For Democrats, the field appeared wide open after former Vice
President Al Gore quashed speculation that he would seek his old Senate
seat. Gore, who is considering whether to run again for president in 2004
after his narrow loss in 2000, said through a spokesman that he would
help the eventual Democratic nominee in Tennessee but not run himself.</LD>
<LD>   Many prominent Republicans, trying to hold on to what had been a safe
seat in their column, began to rally Friday behind a top-tier candidate
of their own to replace Thompson: Lamar Alexander, former Tennessee
governor and two-time presidential contender.</LD>
<TE>   "I will seriously consider being a candidate to succeed [Thompson] and
will make a prompt decision," Alexander said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The filing deadline for candidates is April 4, and the parties will
choose nominees Aug. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the GOP clears the primary field for Alexander, Thompson's
decision to step down after his term ends in January posed an unexpected
challenge as the party seeks to regain a Senate majority.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, who control the Senate by one seat, cheered the emergence
of a potential headache for Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson is the party's fourth incumbent senator to announce
retirement plans, after Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Jesse Helms of
North Carolina and Phil Gramm of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's another open seat, another competitive race, one more place
where Republicans are playing defense," said Jim Jordan, executive
director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson last year flirted with not seeking reelection, but after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks decided to run. His reversal Friday came just
weeks after the death of his 38-year-old daughter following a heart
attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I simply do not have the heart for another six-year term," Thompson
said in a statement. "Serving in the Senate has been a tremendous honor,
but I feel that I have other priorities that I need to attend to. I hope
that my friends and supporters who may be disappointed will understand."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush said Thompson "has served the people of Tennessee with
honor, distinction and class."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, 59, hit the political stage in Washington nearly 30 years
ago as chief Republican counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee. He
later worked as an investigator for then-Gov. Alexander in Tennessee and
launched an acting career. He appeared in 18 movies, including "The Hunt
for Red October." Frequently he played government, military or law
enforcement roles.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Thompson won a special election to the Senate seat Gore gave
up when he became vice president. Thompson easily won a full six-year
term in 1996 and was not expected to face a serious challenge this year.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts agreed that Thompson's departure will give
Democrats an opening to snare a seat from the Republican column--but how
wide an opening remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Charlie Cook said that the race would lean toward the GOP if
Alexander runs, and would be a tossup if he does not.</TE>
<TE>   Another potential Republican candidate is Rep. Ed Bryant, a four-term
veteran who is best known for serving on the House prosecution team
during the 1999 impeachment proceedings against President Clinton. Rep.
Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.) is also mentioned as a possible candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes in the race are especially high for Republicans. A loss
there "would make it awfully hard for them to take over the Senate," said
analyst Stuart Rothenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Among Democrats, possible contenders are Reps. Harold E. Ford Jr. of
Memphis, a keynote speaker at the 2000 Democratic National Convention;
Bob Clement, whose father was a three-term governor of the state; and
John S. Tanner.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Thompson rose to become the top Republican on the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. From that perch, he led hearings
into fund-raising scandals that emerged from the 1996 Clinton-Gore
reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Those hearings opened with Thompson's bold assertion that the Chinese
government had attempted to influence the congressional and presidential
elections with "substantial sums of money," but ended somewhat
inconclusively as important witnesses declined to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson also has veered from the mainstream GOP line on several
occasions. Unlike most Republicans in Congress, he has been a fervent
supporter of the effort led by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to diminish the
role of big-money contributions in U.S. politics.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2000 presidential contest, he initially favored Alexander and
then McCain for the party's nomination. In the general election, Thompson
stumped for Bush.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With jurors deadlocked over a proposed death sentence, Seattle's
"shipyard shooter"--who killed two men in 1999 and wounded two
others--drew a life sentence with no chance of parole.</LD>
<LD>   The jury split after lawyers for Kevin Cruz, 32, claimed he was
mentally ill and therefore could not receive the death sentence requested
by King County prosecutors, a court official said.</LD>
<LD>   Cruz was convicted last month of the shootings at a Seattle shipyard
where he once worked. Prosecutors said vengeance motivated Cruz, who
blamed the shipyard when his disability benefits were cut off.</LD>

<LD>Jurors in Atlanta began deliberations in the trial of Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin--the former radical once known as H. Rap Brown--who is
accused of killing a sheriff's deputy and wounding another.</LD>
<LD>   In closing statements, the defense argued that someone else shot the
two Fulton County deputies March 16, 2000, and that the people who know
what happened--including Al-Amin--aren't talking.</LD>
<LD>   The defense says that Al-Amin, now a 58-year-old Muslim cleric, is a
victim of mistaken identity and is the target of a government vendetta.
Attorney Jack Martin said his client left town because he knew police
were looking for him and he was afraid they would kill him.</LD>

<LD>A rancher who owns a key section of land in Eads designated for the
Sand Creek Massacre Historic Site says he's fed up with the government's

<LD>   William Dawson wants $1.5 million for his 1,465 acres. The government
has offered him $332,000.</LD>
<LD>   "That price is so low I could sell it to either of my two neighbors

<DH>Law: Anger follows a Texas suspect's release from jail in a
homeless man's gruesome death. A judge raises her bond significantly in
response.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Under pressure from a scandalized community, a Fort Worth judge
ordered a nursing home aide back to jail Friday, charged with letting a
homeless man bleed to death slowly in her garage.</LD>
<LD>   Chante Mallard, 25, told police she ran over Gregory Glenn Biggs, then
hid the dying vagrant in her garage and ignored his moans for two days
because she was afraid she'd go to jail. The news that Mallard was
released on $10,000 bond Thursday provoked a flurry of furious telephone
calls to prosecutors from people outraged over Mallard's alleged
indifference.</LD>
<LD>   In response, Judge James Wilson on Friday bumped Mallard's bond up to
$250,000. If she comes up with the money, Mallard will be placed under
house arrest and tracked by an electronic monitor. She has been charged
with murder.</LD>
<TE>   "It is no secret that the community is outraged by the offense of the
defendant, and I'd remind the court this is a murder charge," said
Richard Alpert, a Tarrant County assistant district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Fort Worth police say Mallard got drunk and took Ecstasy in late
October, then hopped into her car and drove home. She slammed into Biggs
and kept on driving, with the 37-year-old man's torso wedged through the
windshield, until she reached her garage.</TE>
<TE>   "She then went inside, had sex with her boyfriend and . . . went out
to the garage and the man wasn't dead yet, but he was dying," said an
affidavit released this week. "The man was asking them to help him, but
they just walked back inside."</TE>
<TE>Loose Lips Over Drinks Led to Arrest</TE>
<TE>   It took Biggs days to bleed to death, police say. In the meantime,
Mallard went into the garage several times to check on Biggs, but she
ignored the dying man's pleas for help, the affidavit said.</TE>
<TE>   More arrests could follow, police said. On Friday, investigators were
scrambling to figure out how many others knew about the death and who
dumped Biggs' body in woodsy Cobbs Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just trying to determine who else was involved," police
spokesman Duane Paul said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Mallard was arrested Wednesday after telling her story to girlfriends
over cocktails in February. When her friends asked why she wasn't
cruising around in her gold Chevrolet anymore, Mallard giggled. "I hit
this white man," she said, according to the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most horrific thing I've ever heard of in my life," said Don
Shisler, president of Union Gospel Mission, a Fort Worth homeless shelter
where Biggs frequently slept. "It really saddens me that Greg had all
these problems, living on and off the streets. And then this. Who has the
worst problem here, you know?"</TE>
<TE>   A former Fort Worth school bus driver and bricklayer, Biggs had fallen
on hard times in recent years and slumped into homelessness. Still, he
kept his clothes clean and his hair neat, and plucked bouquets of flowers
for shelter workers.</TE>
<TE>   If she hadn't held forth to her friends, Mallard might never have
heard another word about Biggs. As soon as she got her hands on her
income tax refund, she told her friends, she'd burn her old car and start
fresh with a new vehicle. Then nobody could link her to the homeless man
whose bones were buried in a pauper's grave in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>Late-Night Drive Home Turned Deadly</TE>
<TE>   "If she hadn't talked about it, I think she would have gotten by with
it," said John Suggs, director of Presbyterian Night Shelter in Fort
Worth.</TE>
<TE>   "No one would be looking for him," Suggs said. "No one would have
connected it all together."</TE>
<TE>   But one of Mallard's friends called police, and detectives paid a
visit to the garage in Fort Worth. Inside, they discovered the dented,
gutted car with bloodstained floor. In the backyard, they found the
seats. One had been burned. When questioned, Mallard told police her
story.</TE>
<TE>   It was a few hours before dawn on Oct. 26, she said, when she headed
home from a night of drinking at Joe's Bamboo Club.</TE>
<TE>   As she pulled around a long curve, a man emerged from the darkness,
and Mallard slammed into him. His body plunged through the windshield,
and his legs were over the hood. A panicked Mallard veered home, with the
man lodged in the windshield, pulled into the garage and shut the door.</TE>
<TE>   She sprawled on the kitchen floor and wept, Mallard told police.</TE>
<TE>   "Chante stated she would go back out and tell the man she was sorry,
but she advised that the man was just moaning," the affidavit says.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Mallard told police, she couldn't bring herself to enter the
garage. She called a friend, who hauled the body from the property, and
never told Mallard the full story of its disposal.</TE>
<TE>Suspect Gave Different Account to Her Friends</TE>
<TE>   But that isn't the version Mallard gave her friends, according to the
affidavit. The nurse's aide told her friends that she waited until Biggs
died, then enlisted her boyfriend and his brother to haul the body to the
fringes of a park in south Fort Worth.</TE>
<TE>   "Shantae [sic] did state that when they dumped him in the park, his
legs were all broken and twisted up," the affidavit says.</TE>
<TE>   When a pair of elderly men stumbled across Biggs' body, police were
suspicious. Biggs was bundled in a suit jacket and sweatshirt, and his
pants dangled from one ankle. His blood had settled into the front of his
body, as if he'd been lying on his face for hours before dying.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives were sure he'd been killed elsewhere and dumped at the
park--but there were no other clues.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew something wasn't right," police spokesman Paul said.</TE>

<HD>Senate Bill to Boost Ethanol Use in Gasoline Gains</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Measure has bipartisan backing, but California
officials are worried about a possible energy crisis in the state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A measure that would require a nationwide increase in the use of
ethanol in gasoline gained momentum in the Senate on Friday, despite
warnings it could lead to gasoline price spikes and supply shortages in
California.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, expected to be included in a comprehensive energy bill
before the Senate, is one of the few issues in a contentious debate on
energy policy that has brought together Democratic and Republican
lawmakers. That is due in part to the support for ethanol, a form of
alcohol made from corn and other crops, in the politically important Corn
Belt.</LD>
<LD>   California officials, however, are worried that the ethanol
requirement would lead to a second energy crisis in the state because of
logistical hurdles in bringing hundreds of millions of gallons of ethanol
from the Midwest to California.</LD>
<TE>Feinstein Sees Spike in Prices</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) warned that it could subject the
state to price volatility in the ethanol market in the same way it was
forced to buy electricity at sky-high prices last year.</TE>
<TE>   The ethanol industry has said it would have enough ethanol to meet
California's demands. And oil industry officials said they foresee no
significant problems for California and other states in meeting the
mandate.</TE>
<TE>   A bipartisan group of senators announced agreement Friday on the
measure, which calls for tripling the use of renewable fuels, such as
ethanol, in gasoline to 5 billion gallons by 2012. The provision also
would phase out over four years the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether,
or MTBE, which makes fuel burn cleaner but has been found to contaminate
ground water. About 1.7 billion gallons of ethanol are now used in
gasoline, mostly in the Midwest, to help fuel burn cleaner.</TE>
<TE>   Endorsed by the Bush administration and Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.), the measure is virtually assured of Senate passage.
Whether it becomes law is uncertain because of sharp differences between
the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-run Senate on other
aspects of the energy bill.</TE>
<TE>Differences Center on Fuel Economy, Drilling</TE>
<TE>   Democrats want tougher fuel-economy standards for sport-utility
vehicles and other cars and trucks, which Republicans generally oppose.
Republicans are pushing for more drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, which Democrats generally oppose.</TE>
<TE>   Those differences could lead to a stalemate that kills the entire
bill.</TE>
<TE>   The ethanol measure would change a key 1990 amendment to the federal
Clean Air Act requiring gasoline sold in the nation's smoggiest regions
to contain an "oxygenate." Refiners have generally used MTBE.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Gov. Gray Davis in 1999 ordered that MTBE be phased out
by Dec. 31, 2002. With other states also moving to end the use of MTBE,
farm-state lawmakers saw an opportunity to promote ethanol as a
substitute.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, supported by oil companies, has contended that California can
produce gasoline that meets clean-air standards without using MTBE or
ethanol. He tried to get a waiver from the Bush administration from
having to use either, but the Environmental Protection Agency rejected
the request last June.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the governor said Friday that Davis is concerned about
the problems involved in bringing ethanol into California and storing
large quantities of it. The fuel additive cannot be shipped by pipeline.
It must be sent by ship, rail or truck from its Midwest producers.
Ethanol also requires its own storage tanks.</TE>
<TE>   Ethanol advocates said the measure proposed for the Senate bill
includes protections from price spikes and supply shortages. For
instance, it would allow the EPA administrator to reduce the ethanol
mandate if price and supply problems arise.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein called the proposal objectionable because California does
not need large quantities of ethanol to meet clean-air standards. "We
will be forced to use a huge amount of ethanol that we don't really
need," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Schiliro, chief of staff for Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los
Angeles), agreed with that assessment and added: "So if this is an
economic assistance program for the Midwest, call it an economic
assistance program. And then if that's what it is, provide economic
assistance to California if gas prices are going to go up as a result."</TE>
<TE>   Senators endorsing the ethanol mandate said it would reduce U.S.
dependence on foreign oil by 500 million barrels over the next decade, do
it in an environmentally friendly way and boost U.S. farm income.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the show of unity on ethanol, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham
put in a pitch for President Bush's call for more domestic energy
production.</TE>
<TE>   "While we were glad to see the Senate moving forward in this area,
it's important to emphasize that the use of renewable fuels is only one
part of a national energy policy," he said. "A national energy policy
must be balanced and must include energy efficiency, energy conservation
and energy production."</TE>
<TE>   In its first week of debate on the energy legislation, the Senate
mainly dealt with provisions that enjoyed bipartisan support.</TE>
<TE>   These included a pipeline safety measure approved Friday that calls
for better training of inspectors and raises penalties for safety
violations.</TE>
<TE>   But the debate is expected to heat up considerably next week when
lawmakers take up a proposal to raise fuel-economy standards to 36 miles
per gallon by 2015, the biggest increase since the fuel-economy bill was
signed into law by President Ford.</TE>
<TE>   The tougher standards are opposed by the Bush administration, the auto
industry and lawmakers from vehicle-producing states.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, both sides in the dispute on oil drilling in the Arctic
refuge are threatening to filibuster over the issue--a tactic that could
doom efforts to pass the first comprehensive energy legislation in a
decade.</TE>

<HD>Florida Bishop Admits Abuse, Asks to Resign</HD>
<DH>Clergy: Despite a 1996 settlement with the victim, Rev. Anthony J.
O'Connell answers to 25-year-old incident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic bishop who admitted molesting a teenager 25 years
ago submitted his resignation Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "I am truly deeply sorry for the pain . . . and confusion I have
caused," said the Rev. Anthony J. O'Connell, bishop of the Diocese of
Palm Beach. "I've been loved since I entered this diocese, far more than
anyone should be loved."</LD>
<LD>   O'Connell, 63, admitted to the allegations leveled by Christopher
Dixon, his former student at St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary in Hannibal,
Mo., where O'Connell was the rector. Dixon became a priest but left after
several years.</LD>
<TE>   Dixon, now 40, said the two touched inappropriately in bed after he
sought O'Connell for counseling. Dixon said the abuse began in 1977, when
he was 15, and continued to 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he had been involved with other youngsters, O'Connell
said there could be "one other person of a somewhat similar situation, in
a somewhat similar time frame." He would not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Diocese spokesman Sam Barbaro said the Vatican would make the final
decision on O'Connell's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   No one was available to comment at the papal nuncio in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's latest and biggest sex-abuse scandal involving priests
began in the Archdiocese of Boston, where Cardinal Bernard F. Law
admitted that a former priest molested children for years but was
shuttled from parish to parish anyway. More than 130 people have said the
defrocked priest, John Geoghan, abused them.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Wilton Gregory, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops, expressed "profound sorrow and regret" about O'Connell's
wrongdoing and apologized directly to Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell, who has been a priest for 38 years, was bishop of
Knoxville, Tenn., before coming to Palm Beach in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell's admission came soon after Florida's bishops issued a
statement calling sexual abuse "both criminal and sinful."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon said O'Connell's decision was bittersweet.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways I feel good that the truth is out there and he's
admitted to it," Dixon said. "The bad part is that I know a lot of people
are going to be upset. But you know, I had to tell the story."</TE>
<TE>   The Jefferson City, Mo., diocese paid Dixon $125,000 in a 1996
settlement.</TE>

<HD>Wyoming Wrangles With Postal Service</HD>
<DH>Stamps: State claims the cowboy image is theirs alone, and it's an
insult to see it illustrating Montana.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHEYENNE, Wyo.
</DL>
<LD>The silhouette of a bucking horse, a hat-waving cowboy on its back,
has been Wyoming's registered trademark since the 1970s. But its use by
the state goes back almost a century.</LD>
<LD>   The Wyoming National Guard carried the symbol when it marched off to
World War I. It has been on state license plates since 1936. It is the
logo of the University of Wyoming.</LD>
<LD>   So when a bucking horse, a hat-waving cowboy on its back, appeared on
Montana's stamp in a 50-state U.S. Postal Service commemorative stamp
series, Wyoming felt like rustlers had hit.</LD>
<TE>   Secretary of State Joe Meyer filed an objection with Karla W.
Corcoran, inspector general of the U.S. Postal Service.</TE>
<TE>   "Using the Wyoming Bucking Horse &amp; Rider trademark on a Montana stamp
makes about as much sense as using the Texas Lone Star on a Louisiana
stamp," Meyer protested.</TE>
<TE>   The "Greetings From America" series, which is modeled after 1940s-era
postcards, is scheduled for release in April. Each stamp has a colorful
illustration and says "Greetings from . . . " followed by the name of the
state.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer said Thursday that state officials asked the Postal Service
several times to use the bucking horse and rider for Wyoming's stamp but
never heard back from the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know they were going to use it for some other state," he
said. "We cannot let a use by someone else occur without raising the
objection that it's ours."</TE>
<TE>   It is not the first time Meyer has ridden to the rescue of Wyoming's
cowboy symbol. He has threatened a handful of colleges and universities
for using similar logos. In August, he persuaded McNeese State
University, in Lake Charles, La., to alter its bucking horse and rider
logo to reduce a resemblance to Wyoming's.</TE>
<TE>   Gayle Shirley, spokeswoman for Montana Secretary of State Bob Brown,
said that after previewing the stamps on the Internet she can understand
Meyer's concern. But she noted the decision was not Montana's.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly if we had anything to do with the decision, we would have
recognized the strong association people would have with Wyoming when
they see the bucking horse and rider," she said. "We're sorry things
reached this stage without getting resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Meyer agreed his showdown is with the Postal Service, not Montana. But
he doesn't want the Postal Service to scrap the stamp. Nor does he want
the logo on Wyoming's stamp.</TE>
<TE>   He wants money--ideally the 7.5% royalty charged to those who sell
items bearing the logo.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want to come in and make an offer because they don't know how
many stamps they're going to sell, I will be satisfied," Meyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Al DeSarro, spokesman for the Postal Service's Western regional office
in Denver, questions Meyer's claim that the stamp constitutes a misuse of
Wyoming's trademark.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't the same symbol," he said. "It's just a similar image."</TE>
<TE>   DeSarro said all the stamps were designed under independent contract
by Richard Sheaff of Scottsdale, Ariz., and were illustrated by Lonnie
Busch of Franklin, N.C. Sheaff referred all questions Friday to the
Postal Service.</TE>

<HD>Astronauts Ice Up Hubble Camera</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Shuttle Columbia's astronauts completed five days of repairs to the
Hubble Space Telescope on Friday, installing a high-tech, super-cold
refrigerator in hopes of reviving a comatose camera.</LD>
<LD>   It was the fifth and final spacewalk of the mission, described by NASA
as the most challenging service call ever made to the 12-year-old
telescope.</LD>
<LD>   Spacewalkers John Grunsfeld and Richard Linnehan connected the
310-pound refrigerator to an infrared camera that has not worked for the
last three years. They also hung a large radiator on the outside of the
telescope and hooked up cables and plumbing that are part of the
$21-million cooling system.</LD>
<TE>   The system passed its initial tests, but astronomers will not know for
at least a month whether the repairs will allow the camera to peer back
into the dark, dusty regions of the universe and resume its study of
young star clusters, exploding stars and planetary atmospheres.</TE>
<TE>   The astronauts set a spacewalking record for a single shuttle mission:
35 hours and 55 minutes. It surpassed, by 29 minutes, the 1993 record
held by the first Hubble repair team. Both flights featured five
spacewalks.</TE>
<TE>   During the mission, a central power unit was installed, along with
stronger solar wings, a new pointing mechanism and a powerful new camera.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people on this mission, privately, didn't think that we would be
able to accomplish everything that we had set out in our plan," said
Hubble program manager Preston Burch.</TE>
<TE>   All that remained, for the astronauts, was the release of Hubble early
today from the shuttle's cargo bay.</TE>
<TE>   The infrared camera was installed on Hubble in 1997. But it stopped
working in 1999 after its supply of nitrogen ice ran out. The ice was
needed to keep the infrared detectors at their operating temperature of
350 degrees below zero.</TE>
<TE>   To fix the problem, NASA pioneered a system that uses neon gas as the
coolant and a refrigeratorlike compressor. The compressor consists of
three tiny turbines that spin at 400,000 revolutions per minute, 50 to
100 times the operating speed of a car engine. It is virtually
vibration-free, crucial for Hubble's precise picture-taking.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia's astronauts will return to Earth on Tuesday, bringing back
all of the telescope equipment that was removed.</TE>
<TE>   "We've given Hubble a new power system that will take it off into the
next decade of discovery. We've given it new eyes to see deeper into the
universe than it's ever been able to see before," said Grunsfeld, an
astrophysicist who led Columbia's spacewalking team.</TE>
<TE>   Astronomers everywhere, he said, "will be able to enjoy the beauty and
inspiration that these new pictures from Hubble will bring."</TE>
<TE>   A satellite that will join others in relaying those pictures rocketed
into orbit Friday evening. NASA's newest Tracking and Data Relay
Satellite also will provide communication links for space shuttles, the
international space station and other science spacecraft circling Earth.</TE>

<HD>National Memorial Sought for 9/11 Pa. Crash Site</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN GILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The rural Pennsylvania field where a hijacked jetliner crashed
Sept. 11 would become the site of a national memorial under legislation
proposed Friday by Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.).</LD>
<LD>   Murtha, joined by Pennsylvania officials and Jennifer Price, whose
mother and stepfather died on United Airlines Flight 93, said he will
introduce a bill to declare the site hallowed ground and preserve it as a
legacy to the innocent victims who perished there.</LD>
<LD>   "The people on Flight 93 were courageous and heroic in giving their
lives to bring down that airplane before it could reach its intended
target in our nation's capital," Murtha said. "I think it's quite clear
that the crash site has national historical significance."</LD>
<TE>   Flight 93 crashed in western Pennsylvania about 80 miles southeast of
Pittsburgh. President Bush and federal authorities have heralded the
plane's passengers, who reportedly heard about the attacks on the World
Trade Center and Pentagon and took courageous action to keep the
hijackers from flying the plane to Washington and crashing it into a
national landmark.</TE>
<TE>   All 40 passengers and crew members on board the San Francisco-bound
flight perished, along with the four hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have yet to decide what form the memorial will take. Under
the proposed legislation, a 15-member commission, appointed by the
secretary of the Interior, would oversee planning and design. The
National Park Service would have the authority to buy or accept the land,
now privately owned, and would be steward of the site after the memorial
is completed.</TE>
<TE>   While there has been much debate over the fate of the World Trade
Center site, few have objected to the idea of a permanent memorial at the
remote Flight 93 crash site. Local officials said the site has provided
their area with a powerful link to the fight against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The passengers' "valor ignited the American spirit and showed that, in
the course of human events, individuals can make a difference," said Jim
Marker, chairman of the Somerset County Board of Commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   There is a temporary memorial at the site. Marker said the county had
received countless calls supporting a permanent memorial recognizing the
field as "the final resting place of patriots."</TE>
<TE>   Price, who lost her mother and stepfather, Jean and Donald Peterson,
in the crash, said she had spoken with the families of most of the Flight
93 passengers and crew, and they all support the proposed memorial. Many
of the victims' families "believe this is the final resting place of our
family members," she said. "We want it to be a place of beauty."</TE>
<TE>   She said she felt fortunate that of all the places the plane could
have come down, it did so in Somerset County.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we were far away, we felt so distant, so unattached"
immediately after the crash, she said. Addressing the local officials in
attendance, she added, "We heard what you all did on those days after
Sept. 11. I don't know if we can ever say how much we thank you."</TE>
<TE>   Murtha said he hopes the legislation moves quickly through Congress.
As yet, there is no timetable or cost estimate for the memorial, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The owners of the land "have said from day one that they would do
whatever we need to," Marker said. "They've opened their property and
opened their hearts."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Hankinson, the Somerset County Flight 93 coordinator, said
officials already have raised nearly $1 million from private and
corporate donors to build the memorial. That amount would be supplemented
by federal money, Murtha said.</TE>
<TE>   The temporary memorial at the site already receives significant
traffic, and officials expect many visitors this summer, Hankinson said.
A Web site about the memorial and planning process will be launched
Monday, she said. The address is http://www.flt93memorial.org.</TE>
<TE>   A service will be held Monday at Shanksville United Methodist Church,
not far from the crash site, in remembrance of those who died six months
ago, Hankinson said.</TE>
<TE>   "The terrorists didn't believe this country would stand up and fight,"
Murtha said. "The passengers on Flight 93 redefined the war on
terrorism."</TE>

<HD>Texas-Based Charity Sues U.S. Over Frozen Assets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A U.S.-based Muslim charity whose assets were frozen by the
government filed a federal lawsuit Friday demanding that millions of
dollars in donations be released.</LD>
<LD>   The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development sued the Justice
Department, Treasury Department and State Department in U.S. District
Court here seeking immediate relief from the asset freeze.</LD>
<LD>   The group, based in Richardson, Texas, said the government violated
its constitutional rights Dec. 4 by putting a hold on millions of dollars
in donations and seizing computers, files and furniture from its offices
in Texas, California, New Jersey and Illinois. The government took action
against the charity because of its alleged support of the Islamic
militant movement Hamas.</LD>
<TE>   The group alleged in its legal brief that some of the information
authorities used to freeze the assets was gathered by Israeli police
officers who used "physical and psychological torture and other forms of
extreme physical and psychological coercion" of suspected Hamas members
in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The asset freeze, the group said in its lawsuit, could ruin the
charitable organization, and it occurred "without notice, without a
hearing, without a warrant, without probable cause, without statutory
authority and without any rational basis."</TE>
<TE>   "They took everything," said lawyer Nancy Hollander of the raids by
FBI agents. "I believe that [the foundation is] being unfairly targeted;
Holy Land is an American charitable foundation that works to foster peace
and opposes terrorism. And many of the donors to Holy Land are giving in
accordance with their religion."</TE>
<TE>   Hollander said Holy Land has provided charitable aid "all over the
world, including in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities had no comment Friday, saying they could not
discuss the issue because of the lawsuit and the ongoing enforcement
action.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the order Dec. 4, President Bush charged that Holy Land
used its tax-exempt status to raise $13 million during the year, much of
which, he said, ultimately went to Hamas.</TE>
<TE>   Bush called Hamas one of the deadliest terrorist organizations in the
world, citing what he said were the groups' claims of responsibility for
suicide bombings in Israel that killed 28 people in the days before the
asset freeze.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury officials at the time said a wealth of evidence had shown
links between Hamas and Holy Land.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a case of one bad actor stealing from the petty cash
drawer and giving the stolen money to terrorists," said Treasury
Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, who was named in the lawsuit. "This
organization exists to raise money in the United States to promote
terror."</TE>
<TE>   The enforcement action marked the first time the administration moved
against a U.S.-based charity in its crackdown on terrorist organizations
after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Holy Land officials have steadfastly denied any links to terrorist
organizations. The charity raises most of its money through donations in
the U.S., then sends the funds overseas. Some foundation money goes to
widows and children of Hamas members killed by Israeli forces. But the
charity contends that such aid represents a "negligible percentage of
those receiving assistance."</TE>
<TE>   The prominent charity raised $207,000 at a 1995 Los Angeles event at
which the keynote speaker exhorted the crowd to "finish off the Israelis.
Kill them all," according to an FBI memo signed by Dale L. Watson, the
bureau's assistant director of counter-terrorism. U.S. authorities used
the 49-page FBI document to support the enforcement action.</TE>
<TE>   But Holy Land's lawsuit contends that the FBI memo was based on
coerced and unreliable information provided by Israeli authorities, thus
making the asset freeze unfair and improper.</TE>
<TE>   The Watson memo, the lawsuit said, purports to rely in part on
documents allegedly seized by Israeli authorities during a search of an
alleged Holy Land office in Jerusalem on May 7, 1995. It contends that
Israeli authorities selectively used some of those seized documents "to
produce a false picture of Holy Land's operations."</TE>

<HD>Relatives of Crematory Operator Arrested</HD>

<LD>The parents and sister of a crematory operator in rural Noble
suspected of discarding more than 300 corpses rather than cremating them
were arrested late Friday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities in LaFayette, Ga., said they had arrested Ray Marsh Sr.,
75, his wife, Clara C. Marsh, 69, and their daughter, Rhames LaShea
Marsh, 32, on felony charges of signing death certificates even though
they were not licensed funeral home directors, as required by law. Ray
Marsh was taken to jail in a wheelchair.</LD>
<LD>   The couple's son, Ray Brent Marsh, 28, remains jailed on 174 counts of
theft by fraud for taking bodies for incineration and, instead,
depositing them in vaults, sheds and elsewhere on crematory property in
Noble, a small rural community in northwestern Georgia.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the 339 corpses recovered were skeletal, others appeared
mummified, and many were still draped in hospital garb with identifying
toe tags.</TE>
<TE>   Officials offered no comment about the latest arrests because the
judge handling the crematory case has issued a gag order.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's arrests came on the same day that the Georgia state Senate,
by unanimous vote, passed legislation making it a felony to discard
bodies that were intended for cremation.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers also closed administrative loopholes that had allowed
Tri-State Crematory to go uninspected for years, and they allocated
nearly $1 million for the recovery of the bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "I am most appreciative of the way that the General Assembly has laid
most other business aside so that it can focus on the tragedy here in
Walker County," said Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   But the late-afternoon arrests of the senior Marshes and their
daughter angered defense attorney McCracken "Ken" Poston, who represents
Ray Brent Marsh and who said he will now also represent the other
Marshes.</TE>
<TE>   Poston said the arrests were based on papers that had been known to
authorities for weeks. He criticized the late afternoon arrests as
"Friday night specials."</TE>
<TE>   The three were taken to Walker County Jail after their arrests but
were later released on bond.</TE>
<TE>   "These are relatively minor charges, particularly with what they have
charged my original client with," Poston said.</TE>
<TE>   The macabre case surrounding Tri-State Crematory began unfolding Feb.
15, when authorities found a skull on the property.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have uncovered 339 bodies that had been intended for
cremation, and early next week they will excavate a shallow, three-acre
lake that was drained this week.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Brent Marsh, who took over the family-owned crematory in 1996,
told detectives that he did not cremate the bodies because his
incinerator was malfunctioning, although the manufacturer of the furnace
found it operable.</TE>
<TE>   People who believed their deceased relatives had been cremated have
since discovered that treasured urns contained wood chips, concrete
powder and other material. Authorities have identified 109 bodies but
fear more than half will remain unidentified.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who offered little sympathy for the family was James
Marsh, brother of Ray Marsh Sr.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were signing death certificates and they weren't suppose to,
then they were asking for trouble," he said Friday.</TE>

<LD>Twenty-one elderly nuns at the School Sisters of St. Francis order
will be restored the Social Security benefits the government had denied
them because they took a vow of poverty.</LD>
<LD>   The Social Security Administration said the nuns' benefits were
wrongly calculated under a 1978 regulation, said Sister Mary Traupman, an
attorney for the nuns.</LD>
<LD>   The agency refused to comment Friday. The 21 nuns, ranging in age from
75 to 95, live in a nursing home near Pittsburgh.</LD>

<HD>Neil Finn's Happy With the Sad Songs</HD>
<DH>Pop Music*  The New Zealand performer, who has a new album
out, says it's the melancholy tunes to which he's drawn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a line in "Anytime," the leadoff track from New Zealand
rocker Neil Finn's just-released "7 Worlds Collide" album, in which
he sings "Everything is in the balance of a moment I can't control."</LD>
<LD>   After listening to Finn talk for any length of time, it's easy to
view that lyric as a quick summary of his  approach to music.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, for instance, just to keep things interesting, Finn did
several shows in New Zealand and England in which he selected fans to
be his band for a night. They'd rehearse in the afternoon, then play
that evening, for better or worse.</LD>
<TE>   "If you did that all that time, I think it would have some serious
consequences on your health," Finn, 43, said  with a chuckle. "But
what's really good about it is that it forces you to embrace the
struggle and the journey on purely musical terms. When you know
you're not trying to build a career here, just an event you're trying
to make special, you have to concentrate on the music and music
alone. There's a purity in that that's really good."</TE>
<TE>   Finn has sought the spontaneous throughout a career that's
stretched more than two decades, from the time he joined his big
brother Tim's band, Split Enz, in the early '80s, through Crowded
House, the supremely catchy pop-rock band he fronted through four
albums from 1986-96, and on to subsequent solo and duo efforts with

<TE>   This year is shaping up as a particularly fruitful one for Finn.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago he released "7 Worlds Collide," an album culled from
a string of live shows he did last year in New Zealand with
collaborators including his brother, Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder,
Radiohead members Phil Selway and Ed O'Brien, singer-songwriter Lisa
Germano and ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. The set list runs from
Split Enz and Crowded House material to numbers from the Pearl Jam
and Smiths songbooks.</TE>
<TE>   Finn's  doing a quick spate of shows in California early next
week, including a stop Tuesday at the Coach House, on his way to an
appearance at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, but
said he'll return in the summer for a full-blown U.S. tour. (Last
month, Finn rode herd over a spontaneous Split Enz reunion, when all
the members turned up at a 20th wedding anniversary party for Finn
and his wife, Sharon. "There were a lot of rough edges," he said,
"but it was still fun.")</TE>
<TE>   He's also looking forward to a wider U.S. release of the movie
"Rain," for which he wrote his first film score. It's the debut
feature of  Katherine Lindberg, recipient of New York University's
Martin Scorsese Young Filmmaker Fellowship. "Rain" was shown at the
Sundance film festival and has screened at some art theaters in major
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Then come May, Finn will  see the U.S. release of "One All," an
album issued throughout the rest of the world last year with the
title "One Nil." The U.S. version includes two newly recorded songs,
as well as the studio version of "Anytime."</TE>
<TE>   It's a melodically rich, emotionally melancholy collection that
always manages to strike a note of hope with  lyrics exploring the
human race's eternal search for connection and love--in other words,
typically hummable and endearing Neil Finn music.</TE>
<TE>   "I always used to like the sad songs," Finn said.  "Even when I
was a young teenager I would gravitate toward the melancholy songs,
the ones that led you down a path, maybe describing a fearful emotion
or a yearning, then giving you a bit of release. Those are still my
favorite kind of songs."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Te Awamutu, a rural town about 100 miles south of
Auckland, Finn and his  family were  about as far from the center of
the pop music world as they could be without moving off the planet.</TE>
<TE>   Neil absorbed the music of the Beatles and other '60s pop and rock
acts, but he also studied piano, which exposed him to such classical
composers as Beethoven ("I was playing some of his piano
sonatas--just parts, a lot of those were too complex for me") and
Ralph Vaughan Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a big fan of Vaughan Williams because a lot of his stuff is
built on English folk music, and my family has Irish-Celtic roots,"
he said.  "He has an affinity, too, for exquisite chords.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a big sucker for chords," Finn said.  "I love what happens
when you shift from minors to majors, and the way they can echo
moments like when you're looking at nature or when you're on a
beautiful beach or when the rain suddenly comes down. Chords have the
ability to describe landscape--maybe that's a New Zealand thing."</TE>
<TE>   "The other fascinating thing about chords is that when you
discover a new chord change, something you've never done before, and
then find a melody that goes with it, you're tapping into a new
feeling as well," he said.  "There's something you're describing,
maybe something you've been conscious of but never [have] been able
to describe before, and that's really exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Neil Finn plays Tuesday at the Coach House, 33157 Camino
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. 8 p.m. $20. (949) 496-8930.</TE>
<TE>   Not too old to rock 'n' roll yet: The Orange County Performing
Arts Center takes its deepest foray into the world of rock music
with its May 31 booking of  British progressive-rock band Jethro
Tull.</TE>
<TE>   "For a lot of the new population of people that come to the
center, this is their era," said  center president Jerry Mandel.
"We'll be trying to do something like this at least once or twice a
year."</TE>
<TE>   The center has previously hosted a couple of members of the Rock
And Roll Hall of Fame--Ray Charles and Art Garfunkel--along with such
adult pop acts as k.d. lang, Bette Midler and Chicago, most of whom
now fall under the adult-contemporary umbrella.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to see us do acid rock or heavy-metal bands,"
said Mandel,  recalling Tull's Grammy award back in 1988 for hard
rock-metal performance for its album "Crest of a Knave."</TE>
<TE>   As the center's expansion moves ahead, the center's  calendar will
open up to more performances outside the  usual emphasis on classical
music, dance, opera and Broadway shows.</TE>
<TE>   "We clearly need to ramp up," Mandel said.  "So we're looking at
[adding] a solid pop celebrity series." Ticket information: (714)
556-2787.</TE>
<TE>   O.C. hip? VH-1's look at the Orange County music scene is set to
air March 25, with a new title. The documentary originally was called
"Behind the Orange Curtain," a name that's since been changed to
"American Hip Factory." The show traces the stories of such local
acts as the Offspring, No Doubt, Social Distortion, TSOL and the
Adolescents through interviews and performance footage.</TE>
<TE>   Angel flies: Linda Jemison, former owner of Linda's Doll Hut in
Anaheim and a matriarch of the county's grass-roots music scene for
more than a decade, is moving to Los Angeles to launch her new talent
management business, Guardian Angel Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   She's managing pop-rock band Wonderlove and is also gradually
moving into music supervision work for film and television. Jemison
will live in the Los Feliz district but will keep her home in
Fullerton "because so many of my family and friends are in Orange
County. So I'll still be able to commute."</TE>
<TE>   Jemison said  Wonderlove has attracted scouts from several major
labels and will play another industry showcase March 18 at the
Troubadour in West Hollywood. The show is free.</TE>

<HD>Shakespeare May Be 'In Love' but Symphony's Lacking in
Passion</HD>

<LD>"Sing, and dance it trippingly," says Oberon at the end of
Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream," as he commands his fairy
host to sweep through Theseus' palace and bless the three newly
united couples sleeping there.</LD>
<LD>   Would that conductor Carl St.Clair, the Pacific Symphony and the
other forces in the "Shakespeare, In Love" concert Thursday at Costa
Mesa's Orange County Performing Arts Center had taken Oberon's advice
to heart.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, this and other lessons in musicality were delivered
superlatively by South Coast Repertory actors Nike Doukas and Mark
Harelik, as they took on various roles (Puck, Titania and Oberon) in
a performance of Mendelssohn's complete incidental music to the play.</LD>
<TE>   Though they spoke their lines standing at miked podiums on each
side of the conductor, their visionary intensity and vivid delivery
transported the audience to a magical stage space. David Emmes, the
repertory company's producing artistic director, was their director.</TE>
<TE>   The performance soared with every speech delivered and sank with
every purely musical section. Admittedly, those skittering quick
gossamer string passages in the Overture must be a bear to get in
sync, and the Pacific strings didn't quite succeed at that. But what
was the problem in those haunting woodwind chords with which an
inspired 17-year-old Mendelssohn summoned up an entire elfin kingdom?
They fell so flat here.</TE>
<TE>   Why was the Nocturne so leaden? Ditto the Wedding March? Why was
the music even of the Mechanicals so dry and heavy-handed? It was
perplexing.</TE>
<TE>   The women of the Pacific Chorale sounded distant and muted.
Korliss Uecker and Elizabeth Shammash were the dutiful soprano and
mezzo-soprano soloists, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The concert opened with music Shakespeare might have heard, as
filtered through 20th century sensibilities: the Courtly Dances from
Britten's opera "Gloriana," composed to honor the coronation of Queen
Elizabeth II in 1953. Here, St.Clair and the orchestra succeeded in
capturing Britten's deft orchestration. They were less successful in
reveling in Britten's complex rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   Tchaikovsky's "Romeo and Juliet" Overture-Fantasy served as a
rather joyless midpoint of the program. Already drained of passion
from the opening measures (looking back from the tragedy rather than
prefiguring it, perhaps?), the work progressed without tension and
drama.</TE>
<TE>   St.Clair might have been attempting to model the later Karajan
viscous style of continuous, gorgeous sound, but the orchestra
couldn't summon the necessary tonal resources to sustain interest in
that controversial approach. The final passages of conflict before
the epilogue sounded so disjunct one had to wonder if the musicians
could hear themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the orchestra sounded more unified and better integrated
from a seat in the higher reaches of the house. Maybe the players
were getting used to their new rotary trumpets. Lots of maybes.</TE>
<TE>   But the performance raised the question whether Tchaikovsky is a
sure thing. The answer is, apparently not.</TE>
