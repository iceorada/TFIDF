<LD>Can Harry Potter work his box-office magic again?</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Warner Bros. will roll out "Harry Potter and the
Chamber of Secrets," the second film based on J.K. Rowling's wildly
popular fantasy books about the young wizard-in-training.
Expectations are high that the film will match or exceed the success
of last year's first installment, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone," which grossed $969 million worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   The studio is following a similar game plan for the second film,
which will open in more than 3,500 theaters. "Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone" bowed on 8,000 screens in 3,672 North American
theaters -- the widest opening ever.</LD>
<TE>   It's a tough act to follow. It'll take a lot of magic for Warner
Bros. to ignite anywhere near the massive interest that accompanied
the first movie, when legions of children dressed up as little
wizards and descended on theaters.</TE>
<TE>   This time, there is not a new book to fuel fan interest, as
Rowling is still working on the fifth installment of a planned seven.</TE>
<TE>   With a running time of 161 minutes, "Chamber of Secrets" may have
some moviegoers fidgeting in their seats toward the end, but it is an
adventurous ride, and the three children -- Daniel Radcliffe as
Harry, Rupert Grint as Ron and Emma Watson as Hermione -- are uncanny
in their likeness to Rowling's characters.</TE>

<HD>Something's looking up in music: DVDs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brace yourself for an onslaught of sound that's music to your eyes.
Heading into the holidays, pop music DVDs galore are hitting stores.
Last week, DVDs featuring Eric Clapton, the Cult, Barenaked Ladies
and David Gilmour were released; on Tuesday, another batch lands from
Staind, Metallica, Jimi Hendrix and Elton John. Still to come are
Ozzy Osbourne, Green Day, Frank Sinatra, Phish, Usher and "Farm Aid"
DVDs.</LD>
<LD>   "What's fascinating is that DVDs are now becoming more a part of
the regular curriculum, as opposed to being extracurricular," says Ty
Braswell, vice president of new media for Virgin Records, which has
DVDs coming Nov. 26 with Lenny Kravitz, Smashing Pumpkins, the
Gorillaz and Ben Harper.</LD>
<LD>   Until this year, Braswell says, the commercial music video release
"was very seasonal.... Even at this time last year, we only thought
about it to make something in time for Christmas. Now it seems like
I'm almost always expecting a conversation about some potential bonus
DVD or a promo DVD or figuring out what kind of DVD we can do with
this artist or that one."</LD>
<TE>   Several factors are driving a burgeoning role for music DVDs that
has all the markings of a boom.</TE>
<TE>   DVD players are the fastest-selling consumer electronics product
in history, according to the Consumer Electronics Assn. As prices
drop, they're selling at a rate of more than 2 million a month, and a
CEA spokeswoman estimates that 30% of American households now have at
least one DVD player.</TE>
<TE>   Music DVDs themselves, whether marketed on their own or packaged
as a bonus with audio CD releases, are much harder to duplicate or
distribute via Internet file-sharing services. That gives record
companies something extra to entice consumers to buy rather than
download.</TE>
<TE>   With far superior sound and video capabilities, the DVD is showing
signs of grabbing music fans far more than video titles did in the
VCR age.</TE>
<TE>   Music video sales never much topped 1% of total music sales over
the past decade, according to figures from the Recording Industry
Assn. of America. This year, that percentage is expected to almost
double.</TE>
<TE>   That still adds up to 2% of the market, but the picture is
digitally clear: Any growth is good news during a CD sales slump.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, it's huge," says Bob Feterl, Southwest region director
for Tower Records. "We have one of retail's biggest market shares
because our stores have some of the larger DVD sections. One reason
it hasn't exploded more is that most other retailers don't devote the
space to it. They still treat it as a niche category.... The stores
that really put it in everybody's face will really do well."</TE>

<HD>Now you see her ...</HD>
<DH>Shakira's changing images and flashy staging get in the way
of artistry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Agustin Gurza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Shakira played a peekaboo performance with her fans Friday at the San
Diego Sports Arena. The Colombian crossover sensation repeatedly
popped up, vanished and reappeared in various incarnations during the
opening night of her first world tour.</LD>
<LD>   She first emerged from beneath an enormous cobra that raises its
flared head as if charmed by the petite singer's famous midriff
shimmy. Later, she ascended from beneath the stage sitting behind a
drum kit, keeping a credible rock beat for a few bars. At another
point, she ventured onto an elevated side platform and impersonated a
stripper, writhing on the railings dangerously near the crowd, which
turned a tad unruly the next time she got that close.</LD>
<LD>   In a recent interview, the ambitious singer-songwriter explained
that she lets "the real Shakira come out" only while performing. But
during Friday's extravagantly staged affair, complete with shooting
flames and deafening explosions, you wished the real Shakira would
just sit still long enough to let us get to know her.</LD>
<TE>   Is she a full-throttle rocker or a bleached-blond Latina diva? A
teen queen or a rebel with a biting social message? A graceful belly
dancer or a honky-tonk woman blowing a mean harmonica (she played a
few bars on that instrument as well)?</TE>
<TE>   Shakira, who performs Tuesday at the Arrowhead Pond and Wednesday
at Staples Center, showed all those sides in a two-hour show that was
like a shotgun blast in the dark. In the end, you felt stunned, but
not enlightened.</TE>
<TE>   Most people in the U.S. discovered Shakira just a year ago when
she released her first English-language album, "Laundry Service." The
25-year-old beauty from Barranquilla mesmerized American audiences
with her sultry, bare-bellied performance for the video of her first
hit single, "Whenever, Wherever."</TE>
<TE>   The album, which has sold 10 million copies worldwide, is a
polished yet edgy collection of pop love songs with quirky lyrics,
catchy melodies and rock guitars, her main instrument. Shakira
perfected her English to write her own lyrics. But her themes have
that same ring of real-life relationships that infused her Spanish
work over the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   Of all her Colombian contemporaries emerging from the alternative
music scene (Juanes, Cabas, Carlos Vives), Shakira has the least
connection to native forms such as cumbia or vallenato. Her new album
features only light Latin touches: an Andean pan flute here, an
Argentine accordion there.</TE>
<TE>   That stylistic consistency allows her to divide her show naturally
between her English and Spanish compositions: Eight from the new
album and eight from her two previous Spanish releases, 1998's "Donde
Estan Los Ladrones?" and 1995's "Pies Descalzos."</TE>
<TE>   To her credit, Shakira has not abandoned her Middle Eastern
identity (as she did her father's Lebanese surname, Mubarak). Because
her big U.S. push came in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, some
predicted that she'd be forced to downplay the Arab influence in
songs such as "Ojos Asi," included on the new album in an English
translation by Gloria Estefan titled "Eyes Like Yours."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the barefoot Shakira boldly opened with that song in
Spanish, drawing excited cheers every time she shook her hips like a
belly dancer. Several young female admirers in the overwhelmingly
Latino crowd wore hip scarves decorated with coins or tassels, like
Shakira's. (Only a handful, however, bleached their hair like the
star, a natural brunette.)</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Shakira not shy away from her heritage, she also used
her concert to deliver an anti-war message that skewered both
President Bush and Saddam Hussein. While she sang "Octavo Dia," a
snarling indictment of world conditions that she wrote years ago, a
grainy video portrayed the two leaders as puppets playing a hostile
game of chess. As the song reached an alarming crescendo of wailing
electric guitars, the puppeteer was revealed to be the Grim Reaper.</TE>
<TE>   It was a powerful protest, reinforced by the masks of political
figures worn by her nine-piece rock band. And it was a sign that
Shakira wants her new fans to take her seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "They've seen the external aspect of me as an artist," she said
recently in Miami, where she lives with her parents. "They've seen me
shaking my butt around. They've seen me on covers of magazines. I
think I've called their attention. But now it's time to make this
relationship deeper, and based on things that will make it last
...hopefully."</TE>
<TE>   Shakira said she was surprised that the U.S. and British public
quickly turned her into a sex symbol, putting her on the covers of
men's magazines. "For a second, I was like, 'Hmmm, really? Am I that
sexy?' Of course, I enjoyed it. I felt flattered. It was fun, but
then after a while it just gets boring. I'm a little sick of that.
And I want to move on."</TE>
<TE>   Shakira's so-called Tour of the Mongoose is designed to help
reshape her sexpot image. She is now the mongoose, an animal known
for its ability to kill poisonous snakes. Fittingly, she makes her
exit by jumping down a hole in the stage, leaving a message behind on
the video screen: "Bite the head of hatred."</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps it was the pressure to say too much that gave the
concert a frenetic feel. Shakira plays the harmonica and drums so
briefly that the instruments seem like disposable props to make a
point: "See, I really am a musician."</TE>
<TE>   And the stage effects, though entertaining, sometimes let
spectacle overshadow artistry. (In one ascent from beneath the stage,
she appears wearing a chandelier on her head to show she can keep her
neck steady while moving everything else.)</TE>
<TE>   Shakira doesn't need so many gimmicks. Her voice alone is a
powerful instrument, fluttering between her warbling falsetto and a
husky lustiness. And her songs, reflecting both romantic devotion and
a spirited independence, have a magical power to connect with young
people, like the thousands of girls who sang along in both languages,
bouncing and clapping joyfully.</TE>
<TE>   You had to turn from all the action on stage to see the fans'
smiling faces, full of life and wide-eyed with admiration for this
bright star who embodies all their dreams. That was the most
memorable effect of all.</TE>

<HD>Korn thunders its outcast sound</HD>
<DH>The band's 75-minute set of big beats merging hip-hop and
metal connects with the fans at Long Beach Arena.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Korn is no pop band. The music doesn't go down easily, nor is it
meant to. It is a storm of noise and subversive hooks, both tribal
and industrial, a place where Goth metal and hip-hop beats share
equal billing.</LD>
<LD>   It is also a sound immediately recognizable as Korn and no one
else, an important distinction in a genre overloaded with
manufactured angst and predictability. Several million in record
sales after their 1994 debut, the members of Korn still sound like
outcasts.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, the first of two nights at the Long Beach Arena, Korn
delivered dementia in thundering, five-minute packages, rooted in
childhood trauma and grown-up self-loathing. It could make for
disturbing, celebratory moments, and seemed more genuine than many
nu-metal acts Korn helped inspire.</LD>
<TE>   That sound erupted from the first moments of the band's 75-minute
set, opening with the big beats and scraping guitar noises of "Here
to Stay," from the band's new "Untouchables" album.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot give anymore!" shouted singer Jonathan Davis, hopping in
place, as frantic, disparate images flashed behind him on a big
screen: insects, skulls, children on edge, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was a kind of priest-like figure onstage in a long black
skirt embroidered with a large cross, his old running suits now a
distant memory. He presided with measured shrieks and moans, but also
with the heavy-metal scat singing of "Freak on a Leash" or the openly
wounded, strangely yearning expressions of the new "Alone I Break."</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the band connected.</TE>
<TE>   The image of an entire arena floor of fans bouncing in unison to
the big beats is a frequent sight at a Korn concert, and on Saturday
it still made for a memorable, epic scene.</TE>
<TE>   There were roars of recognition for the rock radio hits, as
guitarists James "Munky" Shaffer and Brian "Head" Welch bent over
their instruments, with bass lines from Fieldy so thick that they
sounded subterranean. But the driving force behind Korn's music was
drummer David Silveria, shirtless and the only band member not in
black.</TE>
<TE>   Minus his savage beats or hook-filled metal guitar, some Korn
songs were dirge-like, as fans watched quietly, though "Anaconda"
offered a sly echo of Black Sabbath under the sludge.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, support act Disturbed carried itself like the night's
headliner, with elaborate staging and lights, performing the intense
career-making single "Stupify" along with songs off the band's new
album, "Believe."</TE>
<TE>   Amid grinding riffs and grim content, singer David Draiman led the
band dressed for battle in a black vest and camo pants. The sounds
were brooding, thundering anguish with easy, anthemic hooks.</TE>
<TE>   They did not cut nearly so deep. Not like Korn, a modern band
proving itself as distinctive in its own way as the darkly epic works
of Nine Inch Nails, Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin.</TE>

<LD>Queens, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   When you're young, it's all about the music. It gives you
something to do, to think about, to be.</LD>
<LD>   But days after the funeral of a pioneering rap deejay, two friends
approaching middle age were still trying to square his life with
theirs.</LD>
<TE>   Edward McCoy, 35, and Tyrone Williams, 45, had both known Jason
"Jam Master Jay" Mizell of Run-DMC, and when the church filled with a
soul singer's rendering of "Amazing Grace" at his funeral last week,
both men became lost in thought.</TE>
<TE>   From the balcony of a cavernous church brimming with hip-hop
trailblazers, Williams said he couldn't take his eyes off the front
pew where Mizell's young sons kept their heads buried in their
mother's lap. "My life is all about my kids now," Williams said. "I
know those boys will miss Jay."</TE>
<TE>   McCoy also was struck by Mizell's photograph in the funeral
program. Instead of his usual stage garb -- a scowl, a black leather
jacket and unlaced Adidas sneakers -- Mizell wore the uniform of
tree-lined street Queens where he grew up. He had a contented smile
and a black-and-yellow flannel shirt. He looked happy, posed under a
dogwood tree.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Mizell came to fame scratching a needle back and
forth on vinyl records. With crushing beats and inclusive lyrics
about life on the street, Run-DMC made hip-hop history by bringing it
into the mainstream. Then the trio settled into a bourgeois dream.
For Mizell, that meant a family and recording studio in his Queens
neighborhood. Although the trio hadn't had a hit in years, they
endured as impressive live performers.</TE>
<TE>   Then, suddenly, Mizell was dead, slain at 37 before he could
fashion a second act.</TE>
<TE>   Hope, success, tragedy -- his life becomes another rap story. The
hero of such a tale does not confront the complexities of middle age.
That is what is left for Williams and McCoy, both ex-rappers.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy is an intimidating figure. At 6-foot-3, he appeared at the
funeral in clothes fitting his street name, Lux Diamond. He wore a
black leather jacket and matching pants, gold-buckled shoes, diamond
studs in his ears and a wide-brimmed black fedora.</TE>
<TE>   A day later, however, he had transformed back into Mr. McCoy.
"That's what they call me at work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. McCoy is a New York City bus driver. He lives with his wife of
16 years and three children not far from where he grew up in the
Bronx.</TE>
<TE>   "I was never the type of person who threw all my eggs in one
basket," he said. Even when he was rapping at night in a gang,
carrying a gun, he was also driving a Coca-Cola truck to support
himself, which he did from age 12.</TE>
<TE>   But it was music that sustained him, music that provided all the
answers to his questions about life, music that made him feel free --
things that a Buddy Holly or John Lennon or even a Kurt Cobain fan
could understand.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the gang Zulu Nation, McCoy spent his teens emceeing
at outdoor parties in public parks around the Bronx projects. His
friends would plug a sound system into a street power box, play
records and McCoy would rhyme over the beats while the kids danced.
Mostly, he rapped about his prowess -- his looks, his brim, how good
he was.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a battle rapper, but my thing wasn't 'I'm the neighborhood
street gangsta,' " he said. "I almost turned to that. But I liked
party raps better."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, rap wasn't enough. Though he had a producer and a
record company backing him, he looked at other artists and their
dramas and nightmares and realized it wasn't for him.</TE>
<TE>   "Hanging out all night," he recalled, "moving around at a whim, I
couldn't live like that. I wanted to keep my family together and
build a foundation so my kids wouldn't go through what I did."</TE>
<TE>   McCoy has thought about dabbling again in the rap business. But
it's not the same. "I wouldn't know where I fit in now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams also got frustrated with the business before he got out;
he, too, wishes he could find a way back but is convinced rap has
gone beyond him.</TE>
<TE>   As a parent, for example, he doesn't like rap's dirty talk. His
11-year-old daughter, Brittney, was dancing in the back seat recently
with headphones on when she began to sing a Nelly song. "It's getting
hot in here, I want to take my clothes off," she crooned. From the
front seat Williams yelled at her: "What did you say?"</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like such a hypocrite," he admitted.</TE>
<TE>   Raised by his grandparents in the Albany projects of Brooklyn,
Williams graduated from Howard University and eventually landed at
WBLS, a local black radio station, where he ran a news and rap show.
Kids like Lux Diamond would bring their tapes and he played them. And
then Williams would introduce them to producers. That's how he got to
know Mizell. Finally, Williams started his own business, Cold
Chillin', and affiliated with Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd take the kids on the road and we'd be rappin' on the bus and
behind the stage," Williams said. "It was the first time these kids
had ever left the projects. Money wasn't so important. It was the
fun."</TE>
<TE>   He had several successful acts -- MC Shan, Big Daddy Kane, Kool G
Rap, Roxanne Shante and Biz Markie -- all platinum. His acts came
from all the New York boroughs, from the roughest to the most
suburban. But he, too, finally let go. "What really made me give it
up was in 1995 my son was in Little League. I wanted to coach. So I
eased out of it, found a new business."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Williams nor McCoy understands how violence could have
spilled into the life of Mizell, someone they thought immune.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't fit ... the way he died," Williams said. He never
pictured Mizell in a fight that needed settling with a gun.</TE>
<TE>   "With Tupac and Biggie I kind of expected it," Williams said.
"Tupac was looking to die. But Jason didn't want to. He had kids."</TE>
<TE>   They still have his music, Williams and McCoy insist. But it had
seemed to offer so much more, once, when they were young.</TE>

<HD>Vietnamese star defends roles</HD>
<DH>In a letter to his sons, persecuted actor Don Duong speaks
out, saying the government has confused fiction and reality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anita M. Busch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actor Don Duong, under virtual house arrest since he was labeled a
traitor by authorities in his native Vietnam, is speaking out for the
first time since his plight made him a Hollywood cause celebre.</LD>
<LD>   Although he has not granted interviews, Duong has written an
impassioned letter to his sons in which he decries the persecution of
artists in Vietnam and defends his work in the movies that have drawn
the attention of the government: "We Were Soldiers" (2002) with Mel
Gibson, and "Green Dragon" (2001) with Patrick Swayze and Forest
Whitaker.</LD>
<LD>   The letter was made available to The Times by Duong's family.</LD>
<TE>   In September, the actor, once one of Vietnam's top stars, ran
afoul of authorities who viewed the films and seized his passport.
Since then, Duong, who has worked as an actor for 20 years and is a
member of the Screen Actors Guild, has been denied movie roles in his
country.</TE>
<TE>   The actor, who lives in Ho Chi Minh City with his two sons,
16-year-old Long and 11-year-old Linh, also faces jail time and may
be prohibited from acting or leaving the country for five years.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote the letter to his sons as one of them sobbed in the next
room, seeking to give them courage and an understanding of why he is
refusing to confess to the crime of which he is accused. Duong, 45,
writes that since he has been "silenced," he is writing so his
children "can know the truth, to affirm ... that I am always and
forever not a traitor."</TE>
<TE>   Duong's sister, Susie Bui, who lives in the U.S., obtained the
letter and released it with his permission because he has not been
permitted to give his side of the story in the Vietnamese press,
which is owned by the state.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe there are a lot of people waiting to hear from him, and
this is the only way for him to communicate to the outside world,"
Bui said.</TE>
<TE>   During the past few weeks, according to Bui, Duong's children have
been harassed and the 16-year-old was pulled out of his classroom and
interrogated by school officials. Duong's home and his actions are
constantly monitored by the police, Bui said.</TE>
<TE>   Duong's plight has prompted many in Hollywood to send letters to
U.S. and Vietnamese officials. Gibson, "Soldiers" filmmaker Randall
Wallace, Swayze, Whitaker, and actor Harvey Keitel have rallied
behind Duong, defending his patriotism and asking for leniency. U.S.
officials also have contacted Vietnamese officials in an effort to
find a resolution.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Duong says Vietnamese officials have confused
cinema and reality.</TE>
<TE>   "Movies must reflect the portrait of history. 'Green Dragon'
re-creates the refugee camps full of tragedy and chaos but still not
lacking love and fellowship.... When I portrayed the character Tai, I
had to assume the viewpoint of that character, not my own viewpoint.
Only idiots who know nothing about movies would confuse Don Duong
with the character Don Duong portrays."</TE>
<TE>   He cites lyrics of a song sung by his character in the film, and
adds: "To attribute those sentiments to the actor Don Duong is truly
ridiculous and extremely cruel."</TE>
<TE>   He said he took the role in "Green Dragon" -- which was produced,
written and directed by Duong's nephews, Tony and Timothy Linh Bui --
to offer a more realistic perception of Vietnamese refugees.</TE>
<TE>   "Some conservatives ... have always considered those refugees as
people who betrayed their country and their people," he writes. "Now
that the war is more than a quarter of a century removed, perceptions
must change.... They are an integral part of the Vietnamese people."</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Duong notes with irony that the other movie to draw
government disapproval -- "We Were Soldiers" -- was condemned by the
same Vietnamese official who lauded a Vietnamese film, "Farewell of
River Ba," even though that movie showed a "very negative image" of
Vietnamese soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   In the last month, Duong has been taken from his home and
interrogated twice by Vietnamese government officials and ordered to
sign a statement admitting his crime. Duong refused.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, Duong explains why he agreed to appear in "We Were
Soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   "I had been invited by filmmaker Randall Wallace to Paramount to
discuss Vietnamese soldiers as heroes and with an attitude of great
respect," he writes. Gen. Harold Moore, author of the book on which
the movie was based, admired the leadership of the Vietnamese
military leader Duong would portray and the courage of the troops he
led.</TE>
<TE>   "Filmmaker Randall Wallace made this film in that spirit. I was
very proud and happy to be allowed to portray Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu
An.This film was made out to honor the young soldiers who lost their
lives in this war."</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, Duong concludes with an emotionally charged homage
to his art, his country and his supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "A film is a work of art, so each person can view it from a
different perspective, but if you take the view of just a few people
and condemn me as a traitor, that would be a precedent in the history
of international cinema.</TE>
<TE>   "I might be 'naive' about politics, but there's one thing I'm sure
of: I have done nothing that bothers my conscience, have done nothing
that is untruthful, have done nothing that I would want to take back.
I have [acted in these films] to erase hate and promote love.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily, in [Vietnam] I have encountered many people who share my
views. They help me and encourage me not to give in, not to lose hope
and humanity in our country.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter where, at Sundance, Berlin, Japan ... I always am proud
to be Vietnamese. I have never done or said anything that would have
negative consequences for my homeland. I forever respect and value
the spirit of the people of Vietnam, just as the sentiment of the
people who are not limited by national borders who have supported me.</TE>
<TE>   "My dear children, make sure you always remember that
relationships between people, even if in other countries, have no
border. Despite governments, people around the world have one heart."</TE>

<HD>A splendid 'Gentleman'</HD>

<LD>There are myriad ways to show off an orchestra. Ever an inventive
program constructor, Jorge Mester on Saturday night again cleverly
displayed his orchestra, the Pasadena Symphony, in a staged
performance of "The Would-Be Gentleman" in the Pasadena Civic
Auditorium.</LD>
<LD>   This was a concoction by artistic director John de Lancie, who
adapted Moliere's play, used conductor Mester in his usual role on
the podium but also in the acting part of the Music Master, put
together an able cast of actors and singers to bring the translated
play to life, and shortened the whole enterprise, including Richard
Strauss' irresistible Incidental Music -- with a few wink-wink,
nudge-nudge additions -- into 90 minutes. It showed off the orchestra
most handsomely; Strauss' original suite is a collection of gorgeous
orchestral gems, to which Mester added some other Strauss
recognizables, such as portions of "Zarathustra" and Salome's Dance.</LD>
<LD>   De Lancie used no sets -- the 35-member reduced orchestra sat at
the back of the stage -- but relied on an abundance of colorful and
point-making costumes, plus creative, effective staging. His
performers then realized all the laughs and a great many nuances in
the compacted text.</LD>
<TE>   The strongest was Steve Vinovich as Monsieur Jordan, well-seconded
by Mester, Ethan Phillips, Ben Livingston and D. Paul Thomas as his
mentors. Marnie Mosiman made an articulate Mme. Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Capri and Musetta Vander were appropriately cast as the Count
and Countess, and danced Nikki Greenburg's witty choreography
effortlessly.</TE>
<TE>   Critical to the evening's success was the small orchestra's
playing, which re-created all the joys and lyric high points in
Strauss' usually forgotten score. Concertmaster Aimee Kreston and
Douglas Davis made thrilling contributions in the violin and cello
solos.</TE>
<TE>   Soaring above the comic fray were exceptionally gifted solo
singers Hila Plitmann and Nazani Ashjian, who reiterated many of the
beauties Strauss created for the female voice.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An overarching theme has emerged from the Richard Greenberg plays
that were selected to close South Coast Repertory's Second Stage last
spring and to open its new Julianne Argyros Stage last Friday. The
two plays' concerns bounce off each other handily.</LD>
<LD>   Greenberg's "The Dazzle" closed the previous space with a
depiction of men who were buried in the past and the present, lacking
any sense of the future. In retrospect, "The Dazzle" appears to have
been South Coast's way of declaring: out with the old, in with the
new.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Greenberg's brand-new "The Violet Hour" is opening the new
Argyros Stage, and -- perversely enough -- its subject is the
futility of becoming future-obsessed. Although the opening of any new
building is a natural occasion for speculation about the future, "The
Violet Hour" points out the limits of such thoughts.</LD>
<TE>   Its conclusion is commonplace: that if you could divine the
future, you probably wouldn't want to do so. By definition, the
future is what will happen, and as such it's not subject to change.
Better to live with a more upbeat vision of what might be.</TE>
<TE>   This is a well-worn lesson, familiar from previous time-travel
tales. But Greenberg's characters are fresh, and his dialogue retains
its customary bite. One of the characters observes that reading the
poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins is "like walking barefoot on a New
England beach. You're constantly being pricked by unexpected stones."
Greenberg's writing often successfully replicates this effect.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, he goes to such great lengths to prevent this
play from becoming predictable -- the chief sin of the Broadway
theater, according to one of the characters -- that Greenberg's
efforts become strained and excessive during the second act.</TE>
<TE>   Like "The Dazzle," "The Violet Hour" is set in New York in the
first decades of the 20th century (specifically, for "The Violet
Hour," in 1919). Both plays also share a visual motif: clutter. When
the curtain rises on "The Violet Hour," we see boxes of manuscripts
filling a Manhattan publisher's office, with glimpses of the skyline
revealed through the windows.</TE>
<TE>   John Pace Seavering (Hamish Linklater) is in his mid-20s,
convinced that his life can only get better, now that the Great War
is over. He has set up his publishing business with some family
funds, but they aren't unlimited. Because of this, he has a dilemma.
Should the first book he publishes be a sprawling opus by his college
buddy Denis McCleary (Curtis Mark Williams) or the memoir of John's
secret older lover, Jessie Brewster (Michelle Hurd), a glamorous
African American singer?</TE>
<TE>   Denis' claim is urgent because his wealthy girlfriend, Rosamund
(Kate Arrington), is searching for some evidence of his future
solvency that she can show her father. But Jessie feels a perpetual
urgency in her life, which she has molded from a poverty-stricken
childhood. She implies that John's failure to publish her book could
spell the end of their affair.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, John is informed by his assistant, Gidger (Mario
Cantone), that a strange machine has been delivered to the anteroom.
As the play develops, the machine begins to spit out pages of
writings from the future. As might be expected of Cantone after his
appearances in "Love! Valour! Compassion!" and "Sex and the City,"
Gidger is a flamboyant closet queen whose interjections and sarcasm
provide at least two-thirds of the play's laughs.</TE>
<TE>   As in "The Dazzle," Greenberg offers no explanations for certain
major elements of his story, such as the machine's arrival and the
origin of the Jessie-John affair. However, the suspension of
disbelief is a little easier here than in the earlier play. Still,
the plot turns in the second act are loose-jointed to the point of
feeling almost arbitrary. Evan Yionoulis staging sags a bit in the
only scene in which John leaves the stage; the story of Denis and
Rosamund doesn't seem important enough to occupy the stage alone at
this point. However, Greenberg's plays that premiere at South Coast
-- most notably "Three Days of Rain" -- often are revised after they
leave. Part of the adventure of a new play on a second stage is the
sense that it's testing its wings, that it may choose to fly in
several directions.</TE>
<TE>   The production looks great. The performances are all on target.
Christopher Barreca's set is sharply focused, Donald Holder's
lighting suggests an array of shades without overemphasizing the
violet.</TE>
<TE>   Of even more importance to South Coast veterans, the Argyros is a
triumph. With 336 seats, none more than 39 feet from the stage, it
retains a cozy warmth and old-fashioned elegance that are in contrast
to the cool, sleek lines of the building's new entrance. We shouldn't
dwell on the future, but it certainly looks promising at the Argyros.</TE>

<HD>Guns can't arrive until Rose does</HD>
<DH>Day 1, singer's tardiness spurred disaster. Day 2, they're
rocking along the comeback trail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TACOMA, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Welcome back to the jungle.</LD>
<LD>   After nine years on the sidelines, Guns N' Roses, the most popular
and volatile American hard-rock band of the '80s, is on the loose
again in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   And one thing's for sure: The second day of the tour was better
than the first.</LD>
<TE>   It got off to a disastrous start Thursday when hundreds of fans
rioted in Vancouver, Canada, after the concert there was canceled
because lead singer Axl Rose's plane was still hours away in
California. A dozen people were arrested in the resulting melee, and
damage to the General Motors Place arena was estimated at $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, before 6,000 fans at the Tacoma Dome here, it was back
to the music as Rose led the new Guns lineup through a frequently
spectacular display of the dynamics that made GNR such an exciting
attraction a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "You didn't think we'd be here, did you?" Rose joked early in the
show. Though the band had to battle sound problems in the massive
building, the musicians seemed as explosive at times as the
accompanying pyrotechnics.</TE>
<TE>   Encouraged by the strong crowd response, Rose was in such good
spirits that he even strapped a mini-KFC bucket to his head late in
the set, imitating the stage trademark of Bucket-head, the
avant-garde guitarist who is a centerpiece of the new Guns cast.</TE>
<TE>   The contrast between the Vancouver flare-up and the Tacoma
dynamics was a reminder of the contradictions that Guns N' Roses
represented at its peak.</TE>
<TE>   From the moment Rose, a high school dropout from Indiana, stepped
on stage at Hollywood clubs in the early '80s, he was labeled the new
Jim Morrison -- a wild child whose tales of demons and desperation
seemed a little too real just to be products of a fertile
imagination.</TE>
<TE>   In public, Rose frequently acted so impulsively in stressful
moments that he seemed like someone who had been dropped into a
hostile world and was fighting back with the clawing tenacity of a
trapped alley cat.</TE>
<TE>   This led to ugly incidents, such as the time in 1991 in St. Louis
when he jumped into the crowd to grab a camera from a fan and then
left the stage, spurring a rampage that resulted in injuries and
$200,000 in damage. Rose acknowledged his inner turmoil and turned to
therapy the same year.</TE>
<TE>   What made Rose matter to millions of rock fans was that he could
write about his tensions and the rock lifestyle with raw, unfiltered
images. The signature song "Welcome to the Jungle" spoke about the
decadence and glamour of the Hollywood music scene with a vividness
that makes it the hard-rock equivalent of the Eagles' "Hotel
California."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Rose could express lost innocence with rare
tenderness and vulnerability in such memorable songs as "Sweet Child
O' Mine" and "November Rain." It was a magical combination, and his
partners in GNR presented the music with a mix of bravado and
self-affirmation.</TE>
<TE>   But the band split apart after a 1993 tour and Rose set about
putting together a new version of Guns N' Roses and working on a new
album.</TE>
<TE>   The only topic of conversation here Friday as popular as the
Vancouver cancellation was what GNR was going to be like without
guitarist Slash and the other original members. The new lineup has
played a few dates over the last two years, and reviews have been
generally positive.</TE>
<TE>   But the real test is this ambitious U.S. tour, which includes
stops at the San Diego Sports Arena on Dec. 27 and at the Forum in
Inglewood on Jan. 3 and 4. Ultimately, Rose needs to convince us that
he still has something to offer, and there were moments during
Friday's concert when you were impatient for him to get on with that
process.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than rethink the old material and put the songs in new and
revealing contexts, Rose seemed too content to merely take us back to
the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   While much of the material remains stirring, some of the tunes,
including "Think About You" and "My Michelle," feel dated. There was
also a distance at times between the musicians and the music. It was
as if they felt straitjacketed having to step into another band's
shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The most touching moments came when Rose seemed the most
introspective. When he sang Bob Dylan's "Knockin' on Heaven's Door"
early in the set, there was a solemnity about him, as if he were
thinking about all those who have passed away in his own life, both
literally and figuratively. He was equally moving at the piano when
he sang "November Rain."</TE>
<TE>   In the few times he turned to new songs that presumably will be on
the new album, which is due next year, Rose seemed consistently
engaged, and the band responded well to stepping beyond the shadow of
GNR. Where his singing on the high-energy tunes sometimes seemed
unduly shrill, he exhibited added character and feeling on the newer
numbers. As the tour proceeds, Rose should preview more new songs to
show more of who he is today, personally and musically.</TE>
<TE>   He also can't afford any more incidents like Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   Though common sense says it would have been smart to be in
Vancouver early in the day, like the rest of the band, for the start
of the tour, Rose's manager, Merck Mercuriadis, said backstage Friday
that Rose prefers to arrive at the arena just before show time.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, Rose's itinerary would have put him at the GM Place
in time to go on at 10 p.m., as scheduled, but he was delayed in
getting to the airport by traffic, the manager said. He added that
the plane would have been in Vancouver in time for Rose to go on by
11 p.m., and that he tried to convince arena officials to let the
show start late, with Rose covering overtime costs.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, arena management canceled the show before fans got into
the building, perhaps fearing an even greater reaction later if there
were any other delays in Rose's arrival. The arena manager declined
to discuss the cancellation Friday.</TE>
<TE>   If the Vancouver blowup involved another artist, it might be
dismissed as simply an isolated incident. But with Rose's history, it
raised a red flag. As the tour proceeds across the country, he needs
to understand that his conduct may be as important as his music in
convincing the rock world that he again deserves its attention.</TE>

<HD>Homesick blues add color to Gough gig</HD>
<DH>The final stop on his U.S. tour is another
stream-of-consciousness showcase for the British enigma also known as
Badly Drawn Boy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"This well may be a song -- who knows?" said Damon Gough, a.k.a.
Badly Drawn Boy, at the start of his concert at the Wiltern on
Friday. For anyone who had seen the scruffy troubadour in concert
before, that likely brought one of two reactions: "Oh boy!" or "Oh
no!"</LD>
<LD>   On stage, BDB is nothing if not erratic, taking a rambling,
stream-of-consciousness approach. It's maddening to some, but to
others it's a ride to emotional and musical peaks of glorious,
life-embracing transcendence and in-the-moment honesty.</LD>
<LD>   Home is where his neo-hippie heart was Friday. He repeatedly noted
that this was the last stop on his U.S. tour and he was eager to get
back to his fiancee and their two children. That mood illuminated
songs from his new album, "Have You Fed the Fish?" It also brought
new dimension to highlights from his shabby 2000 masterpiece "Hour of
Bewilderbeast" and his charm-filled songs and score from the movie
"About a Boy."</LD>
<TE>   Mid-show, he opened a travel bag and produced two photos of his
family, gazed moist-eyed at them and then majestically sang of his
yearning to deserve that kind of love. When fans grumbled later after
he stopped a song due to problems with his monitors, he chided, "It's
only a gig." The beauty is that his gigs, and his music, so well
resemble life.</TE>
<TE>   Resembling a different life, Adam Green opened with his own take
on shabby stream-of-consciousness chic. Sitting on a stool with his
acoustic guitar, the former member of the willfully twisted duo Moldy
Peaches deadpanned cute little ditties that invariably veered into
perversion. They're kiddie songs you'd never want your kids to hear,
but even at their sickest, there was something endearing about this
puckish deviant.</TE>

<HD>'Jimmy Carter' on PBS: It's hail to the ex-chief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How fitting that "Jimmy Carter," a two-part documentary about our
now-celebrated 39th president, arrives on PBS so soon after midterm
elections that cheered George W. Bush and determined the futures of
other current politicians.</LD>
<LD>   Just as Democrats, including Carter's vice president, Walter
Mondale, crashed Tuesday, the 1980 presidential election appeared to
halt the former Georgia governor's public life, driving him from
office at age 56 and sweeping in the era of Ronald Reagan.</LD>
<LD>   The same aw-shucks Reagan who had shrewdly rebutted him in a
widely watched televised debate by deploying that now-famous line:
"There you go again."</LD>
<TE>   Experts cite as Carter's centerpiece achievement his 13 days of
personal diplomacy that resulted in the Camp David accords, which
appeared then to establish a framework for peace in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   He had mostly a hard time of it in office, though, making as many
enemies as his Plains, Ga., hometown had mosquitoes and alienating
even congressional Democrats while reaffirming that more than high
intelligence, tenacity and moral conviction are needed to assure
success as president. A little luck helps, as does a readiness to
achieve one's goals through compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Carter was famous for not returning the calls of leading senators,
for example. "He never understood how the system worked," the late
House Speaker Tip O'Neill would say later. "And although this was out
of character," notes narrator Linda Hunt about the intellectually
keen president, "he didn't want to learn about it either."</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Carters past and present, and the places where they
intersect, are captured vividly in this fine Adriana Bosch film
presented by "American Experience," a series that integrates sound
scholarship and entertainment values in ways that produce some of the
best, most watchable history lessons on television.</TE>
<TE>   This one begins with Jimmy as a high-achieving youth on his
family's farm outside of Plains and traces the "born-again"
conversion, naval career and amazingly swift political ascent of this
peanut mogul, Sunday-school teacher, scoutmaster and Lions Club vice
president. A mere decade before seeking the Democratic nomination for
president, we're told, he was a door-to-door Bible thumper.</TE>
<TE>   Carter isn't interviewed, his surrogate here being his wife,
RosalynnCarter, whose pointed comments affirm that she was no passive
observer as first lady.</TE>
<TE>   Although her husband is the film's singular focus, the current
president also comes to mind, even though his presidency is
incomplete. Connecting those dots: Both men are deeply Christian.
Both barely made it into the White House. Both were pummeled by
depressed economies. Both entered office as callow babes in foreign
affairs. And both were challenged by cataclysmic actions against
Americans originating from abroad, events that were pivotal for them
and the nation.</TE>
<TE>   On this, though, their paths diverge.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001,
notably the U.S.-led offensive against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in
Afghanistan, emboldened him and gave him stature in the view of most
Americans. In contrast, the detention of 50 Americans in Tehran for
440 days by newly installed Iranian fundamentalists projected
weakness and whooshed the remaining air from Carter's already
deflated administration.</TE>
<TE>   Ahead, though, was not oblivion, for Carter's post-presidency has
soared, yielding vastly more praise and respect than his unpopular
presidency, his work on behalf of the poor and disenfranchised
resonating with Americans and his role as a globe-traveling elder
statesman and champion of human rights leading this year to a Nobel
Peace Prize.</TE>
<TE>   As this meticulously balanced film notes, Carter has written his
own banner headline since leaving office. While Gerald Ford has hit
the links, Reagan has atrophied because of Alzheimer's disease,
George Bush the elder has kept low and Bill Clinton has weighed a TV
talk show for big bucks, our other living former president has
endeared himself widely by doing good deeds.</TE>
<TE>   That included handling a hammer for Habitat for Humanity. A
"Carpenter Named Carter," the New York Times titled him. "He could
make lumber sing," his son Chip says in the documentary.</TE>
<TE>   Carter beloved? Who would have thought it? When he left the White
House -- flushed from power by a formidable opponent and epic
problems headed by economic woes and the crippling Iran hostage
crisis -- most of his countrymen would have given him only the booby
prize.</TE>
<TE>   Hardly beneficial either, as the film points out, was the dark
legal cloud that settled over his budget director, Bert Lance, and
dirtied Carter's squeaky-clean image. Damaging, too, was Carter
telling Playboy: "I've committed adultery in my heart many times." As
well as the image of rigid piety he projected while attacking
"self-indulgence and consumption" in a sermonizing TV address that
appeared to blame the public for the nation's ills.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if Richard Nixon could come back after Watergate drove
a stake through his heart, then anyone can. Even the disgraced Nixon,
though, did not rebound as far as Carter.</TE>
<TE>   This dichotomy in Carter's life is as striking as the one
tonight's observers say gave him a dual personality as a public
figure. "Politics was the ego in him and Jesus the humbleness," says
one historian.</TE>
<TE>   The latter personality is especially visible now, the stubbornness
and moral certitude that many found so irritating in Carter becoming
his greatest assets in the service of others.</TE>
<TE>   As there he goes again.</TE>

<HD>Some folks have all the luxe</HD>
<DH>A bad economy? At the priciest stores, affluent shoppers
charge ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Booth Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A $140 Frederic Fekkai hair band, $80 Donna Karan cashmere socks, a
$350 Eric Javits beret? Please! Some people may be aghast at the
prices of the items Winona Ryder was found guilty last week of
shoplifting from Saks Fifth Avenue. But in Beverly Hills, where
plenty of women make shopping a full-time job, it's just a drop in
the burnished platinum bucket.</LD>
<LD>   At Neiman Marcus, try $275 for a black plastic hair clip by France
Luxe; $875 for Judith Leiber sunglasses, $98 for a patchwork print
Roberto Cavalli thong (that's just under $100 for underwear that
doesn't even cover your rear); $840 for a John Galliano T-shirt. At
Barneys New York, how about $530 for Alexander McQueen blue jeans as
tight as pantyhose, or $1,830 for a Lucien Pellat Finet skimpy
cashmere sweater with a marijuana leaf design on the front.</LD>
<LD>   "They are priced kind of high, but they are the hot sweaters of
the moment," the Barneys salesman said sheepishly, adding, "And they
last forever!" (Seems like the price may not be the only thing that's
high.)</LD>
<TE>   This is, of course, the part of the world where Julia Roberts went
on her "Pretty Woman" shopping spree, where, legend has it, Tori
Spelling buys one of every color of the $160 Juicy Couture sweatsuit
at Fred Segal each season, and where Rodeo Drive stores open their
doors at all hours to accommodate the shopping whims of A-list
celebrities like Madonna.</TE>
<TE>   At Saks Fifth Avenue last week -- the scene of the crime, as it
were -- it was business as usual in the Chanel department. A
leather-clad lady ran her bejeweled fingers over a $510 quilted brown
leather belt with faux gold hardware and said, "If you have another
one, I'll pick it up for my friend."</TE>
<TE>   A few doors down, at Neiman Marcus, the Manolo Blahnik department
was hopping. On a couch littered with four open boxes of $455 suede
pumps, a salesman chatted up his well-coiffed client, showing her two
photographs of herself in the latest issue of Beverly Hills 213, a
weekly magazine that chronicles the social lives of the rich and the
ridiculously rich.</TE>
<TE>   On a couch nearby, Barbara Smith watched her 20-year-old daughter,
Vanessa, a student at the Otis College of Art and Design, choose
between Prada's $375 chained mule and $420 chained D'Orsay pump.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, clothes are too expensive," said Smith, clutching a Louis
Vuitton logo bag that matched her daughter's. "But that's not going
to keep us from shopping."</TE>
<TE>   The economy may be sluggish and profits at luxury companies down,
but you'd never know it here. "It's a culture," said Mark Pingol,
senior project director for New York-based market research firm
Envirosell. "These people have everything they need."</TE>
<TE>   At the Ryder trial, Deputy District Atty. Ann Rundle found herself
in the position of defending this spend-to-no-end culture to jurors.
In a lighter moment, she explained to the jury that the law on
shoplifting does not say that Saks deserves to be ripped off because
it sells $200 hair bows.</TE>
<TE>   Still, why would any sane person, even one with limitless funds,
spend $1,830 on a cashmere sweater when Target has $50 versions cut
from the same goat? Or $530 on a canvas beach bag with the Chanel
logo when L.L. Bean has nearly the same one for $17?</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, the actual cost of goods has nothing to do with why
people buy them," said market researcher Pam Danziger, author of "Why
People Buy Things They Don't Need." "These people are buying a
feeling. The product is just a means to an end. It's giving you the
feeling that you are someone special and that you deserve it."</TE>
<TE>   Ask representatives of any luxury company why their clothes and
accessories cost so much and they'll tell you that quality doesn't
come cheap. Chanel handbags run from about $490 for a small canvas
bag to $10,000 for an alligator tote. "There are about 150 steps that
go into making each one of our bags," said the company spokeswoman
Anne Fahey.</TE>
<TE>   The "quality argument" is weaker than single-ply cashmere,
according to Pingol. "It's all about the brand they've created," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Danziger agrees. "I advise my luxury market clients to push the
envelope as far as they can with prices. It's all about what the
consumer thinks something is worth."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps charging sky-high prices is a way for designer brands to
keep their products off the riff-raff. One assumes, after all, that
Miuccia Prada doesn't want just anyone carrying her highly
sought-after name in their hands. "There is a sense of gauging who
you want your customers to be," said Danziger.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, say those who study purchasing habits, what's
at work is as simple as the law of supply and demand. "People were
willing to pay inflated prices for handbags in the 1990s, so prices
went up. And up," said Pat Tunsky, creative director of the Donegar
Group, a trend consulting firm. "All of those luxury brands did very
well then. But now, as a result of the economic situation, they are
not selling as much as in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Outside of the baubled bubble, shoppers are savvier, and it's
become as chic to spend at Costco as at Maxfield.</TE>
<TE>   "We've hit the wall. More and more, consumers are asking for real
value," said Danziger. "Even luxury consumers have become
professional shoppers. They know who's got it for less and what it's
worth."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, no amount of value shopping or outrage over Winona's
champagne shoplifting tastes is going to crush the market for $5,500
Hermes Birkin bags. (The waiting list at the store here is so long,
it's closed until next year.)</TE>
<TE>   Like Palm Beach and Dallas, Beverly Hills will always have
insanely acquisitive, price-oblivious spenders. "There's always going
to be a handful of people that go out of their way to spend the extra
money," said Marshal Cohen, an executive with the market research
firm NPD Group.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about showing the world that tough times haven't affected
them. Or it's that they don't want to admit they are being affected
by tough times."</TE>

<HD>Eminem movie tops predictions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eminem made an explosive feature film debut this weekend, as his "8
Mile" came in at No. 1 with an impressive $54.5 million, according to
studio estimates, and an average of $22,050 per theater nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   Directed by Oscar winner Curtis Hanson (for his screenplay to
"L.A. Confidential"), the film far exceeded pre-release estimates.</LD>
<LD>   Studio executives said they were surprised by how well the R-rated
movie performed.</LD>
<TE>   The studio released the movie on 2,470 theaters, fewer than most
contemporary genre films, which are typically released in 3,000
theaters or more. Multiple prints at individual theaters pushed the
actual screen count to 3,900, meaning that most locations had
back-to-back showings of the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Second was Disney's "The Santa Clause 2," which grossed $24.8
million, dropping only 14% from last weekend's opening figure. Its
total is about $60.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   In third place was DreamWorks' "The Ring," which held up well in
its fourth weekend with $16 million, bringing its cumulative total to
$86.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   At No. 4, Sony's "I Spy" took in an estimated $9 million for a
total of $24.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount/MTV's "Jackass the Movie" slipped to No. 5 with $7.2
million for a total of $53.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Debuting at No. 9. was the Brian De Palma thriller "Femme Fatale,"
taking in $2.8 million and $3.5 million since it opened Wednesday.
The film is in 1,066 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax's "Frida" edged into the top 10 for the first time, tying

$207,110 over the weekend on only six screens for a healthy average
of $34,518.</TE>

<HD>Part's 'Passio' evokes disquiet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People can debate whether the Gospel according to St. John is the
most anti-Semitic of the four. But Arvo Part's "Passio," a 1982
Renaissance redux Latin setting of the John text, heard Saturday at
St. Paul's Greek Orthodox Church in Irvine, relentlessly hammers home
the Jews' responsibility for the Crucifixion.</LD>
<LD>   Other Passion settings try to spread the guilt around by including
arias and choral meditations that link the events to the audience.
Part's sets only the New Testament text in easily perceived
chant-like lines, until a final chorus invokes mercy on all of us as
guilty sinners. Translations were projected on a screen.</LD>
<LD>   Soprano Katharin Rundus, mezzo-soprano Laura Harrison and tenors
John St. Marie and J. Lee Graham, alone or in combinations,
impressively negotiated Part's difficult, stop-and-go minimalist
settings for the role of the evangelist. Baritone James Martin
Schaefer intoned the part of Jesus with reasonable steadiness.</LD>
<TE>   Almost by default, the work became the tragedy of Pilate, so full
of musical character and interest were the settings of his lines,
especially as sung by tenor Joseph Mathieu. John Alexander conducted
the soloists, a group of five musicians and the 20 John Alexander
Singers with care. The concert was part of the Eclectic Orange
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   It would be an abrogation of criticism, however, to disregard the
issue of blaming the Jews for Christ's death when enlightened
Christendom has abjured this position and is trying to overcome a
millennium of religious bigotry with real-life consequences. Dressing
it up in modern high culture doesn't make it acceptable. Enough is
enough.</TE>

<HD>Pushed to the limits in 'Atmosphere'</HD>
<DH>The dance drama finds dancer-choreographer Terry Beeman at
the top of his game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using a showpiece jazz-dance vocabulary to express a profound
spiritual odyssey pushed dancer-choreographer Terry Beeman to the
limits of his considerable creative resources in "Atmosphere" at the
El Portal Theatre on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   However, the best sequences in this eight-part, 75-minute,
abstract dance drama established Beeman as an artist of the highest
potential. Working with a dedicated, 16-member company, he generated
impressive heat and depth in a story about the search for fulfillment
in the threatening contemporary world.</LD>
<LD>   A scene showing three men writhing on skeins of fabric high above
the stage while three women strained at the cords pulling them back
into the wings brilliantly physicalized the worldly attachments that
entangle people. And the rituals that opened and closed the piece
found Beeman attempting to reinvent in a new form the principles of
choric dance pioneered by Mary Wigman and other innovators of early
modernism.</LD>
<TE>   Beeman's challenging dance style prioritized long-held balances in
extension and, especially, an extra kick, shoulder twitch or body
pulse at exactly the point when his dancers reached maximum stretch.
His own authority in this style remained unchallenged on Saturday,
but Blake McGrath added a distinctively passionate attack as Beeman's
partner on the journey.</TE>
<TE>   Also particularly effective: Tammy To as the survivor of a scene
of fearful desperation and Kelley Parker as one of the women who
periodically comforted and assumed the burdens of the most tortured
souls in the piece.</TE>
<TE>   It would be easy to mock some of the lapses and excesses of
"Atmosphere": the men's wax jobs, the women's glamour makeup, the
occasional in-your-face rock overkill. But Beeman is the real thing:
an exciting choreographer, an effective company leader and a
charismatic dancer who can, in pantomime, offer you his heart -- and
make you believe it.</TE>

<KH>MUSIC REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Short but striking pieces at UCLA</HD>
<DH>Pianist Alan Feinberg goes his own way with a well-chosen
selection of recital material.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a strong and reliable pianist is needed for challenging American
music, Alan Feinberg will likely get the first call. Indeed, so
associated is he with such duties, and with his own cleverly designed
thematic recordings and recital programs of short American piano
pieces, that he is easily shoe-boxed. Once again, he chose short
pieces for his recital at UCLA's Schoenberg Hall on Saturday night,
but I wish I knew a shoe store with a selection as wide and striking
yet purposefully arranged.</LD>
<LD>   The evening's first half was Bach-based. It began with odd Bach, a
chorale prelude transcribed by the old-school Russian virtuoso Samuel
Feinberg, segueing into a miscellany of two-part exercises. Then came
a vinegar-and-acid center of short preludes by Galina Ustvolskaya,
the reclusive Russian composer whose spiky music bristles with a
ferocious spiritual intensity and burning fire. Bach's "Chromatic"
Fantasy and Fugue followed. There were no pauses, except for one in
which the pianist corrected an error in the program book.</LD>
<TE>   Feinberg is a bold Bach player, and he flew in the face of
period-practice fashion not only with the grand pianism of his
Russian namesake's texturally lavish arrangement, but also in his
hard-hitting hammering of the first two Duetti and the Sinfonia No.
9. Although these are little pieces usually dismissed as lesson
music, Feinberg underscored their harmonic and thematic restlessness.</TE>
<TE>   Ustvolskaya's tiny Preludes, written in 1953, are Bach without the
niceties, simply the notes -- some mysteriously quiet, some
startlingly explosive -- shorn of harmonic or sensual delicacies. The
last prelude ends inconclusively, as if in mid-phrase, but Feinberg
completed the thought with a magnificently apocalyptic performance of
the "Chromatic" Fantasy and Fugue that came as huge pianistic
release.</TE>
<TE>   Ives, a Feinberg specialty, is not often associated with Bach and
never with Chopin. The famously macho American experimenter rebelled
against Baroque music's contrapuntal conventions and thought Chopin a
softy "having a skirt on." Thus, two wonderful Ives pieces, the
little known "Celestial Railroad" and the "Alcotts" movement from the
"Concord" Sonata, were revelations in a Bach/Chopin context.</TE>
<TE>   Ives was an amazing contrapuntalist who may have made up his own
rules but did so only after having completely absorbed Bach's. "The
Celestial Railroad," which eventually wound up much changed as a
movement in the Fourth Symphony, is a riotous pianistic train trip
after the Hawthorne story; "The Alcotts" is an evening at home with
the transcendentalists.</TE>
<TE>   In both, Beethoven's Fifth is surreal parlor music surround by
popular American tunes and hymns, and Feinberg gave this music an
exceptional immediacy.</TE>
<TE>   The Chopin at the end was another miscellany -- two Mazurkas, the
Barcarolle and the Fourth Scherzo. Feinberg's is a kind of American,
even Ivesian, Chopin, with a strong emphasis on rhythm and careening
sense of experimentation. It is a fascinating way to hear the Polish
composer who is too often put under glass, even if the crashing
conclusions of the Barcarolle and Scherzo somewhat overstated the
case.</TE>
<TE>   The touching and remarkable encore was a John Ireland song, "Life
Is a Sickness Full of Woes," transcribed by Robert Helps. This late
American composer and marvelous Ives pianist dashed Ireland's
Chopin-inspired song with exactly the right amount of American hot
sauce.</TE>

<HD>He led opera out of the ordinary</HD>
<DH>Long Beach's Michael Milenski resigns. His specialty:
'spectacle.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Timberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Milenski, the founder and general director of Long Beach
Opera, has announced his resignation after almost 25 years of
building the company into a small but influential presenter of new
and unusual opera.</LD>
<LD>   Calling this a stable time to make a transition, Milenski, 61,
will pass the company's leadership to its principal conductor,
Andreas Mitisek, 39, who has been with Long Beach Opera since 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The transition, Milenski said, will begin in January, but his
resignation will not go into effect until October. Scheduled June
performances of Offenbach's "La Perichole" and "Seven Small Operas,"
by various composers, will be his final productions.</LD>
<TE>   "Southern California has by this point seen my tricks," Milenski
said, sitting in the office behind his Craftsman house in Long
Beach's Bluff Park. "I'm not interested in repeating myself. Somebody
else can take the reins and move forward; Long Beach Opera is in good
shape."</TE>
<TE>   Mitisek, a native of Vienna, in Los Angeles last week to meet with
donors and staff, promised to keep Long Beach Opera on the cutting
edge. "I will create a different vision but it will be similar to
what [Milenski] has done," he said. "It's such a unique and special
project that Long Beach Opera offers; I identify completely with the
idea."</TE>
<TE>   The conductor, who will continue to make Austria his home, says he
has a list of productions in his mind that could fill 10 seasons.
"Specifically, I don't want to say anything at this moment. But
there's a lot of work that's never been seen here, highly dramatic as
theater and music."</TE>
<TE>   "Highly dramatic" is a good way to describe what Long Beach Opera
became. It began at Long Beach Grand Opera in the 1978-79 season --
seven years before Los Angeles Opera raised a curtain, with a
traditional production of "La Traviata" staged in collaboration with
Long Beach Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '80s, Milenski, who had worked for San Francisco
Opera in such roles as rehearsal coordinator and assistant stage
manager and had staged operas for the San Jose Symphony, began to
turn Long Beach Opera toward experiment and what he calls
"progressive staging." "My main interest is in opera as a theater
art," he said, "in the spectacle part of opera."</TE>
<TE>   The company put on significant 20th century works that others
wouldn't attempt, such as Schoenberg's "Die Jakobsleiter," Cage's
"Europeras 3 &amp; 4," and "King Roger" by Karl Szymanowski. Among the
conductors and directors associated with the company are Nicholas
McGegan and Christopher Alden, who contributed groundbreaking updates
of Monteverdi.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, it presented the first professional U.S. staging of
young British composer Thomas Ades' sexually charged "Powder Her
Face," and Jacopo Peri's "Euridice," from 1600, generally considered
to be the earliest opera with music extant.</TE>
<TE>   In his review of the company's production of Manfred Gurlitt's
"Wozzeck," in June 1998, the Times' Mark Swed offered words that echo
many general assessments of the company's specialty -- "Opera as
adventure and discovery, not convention."</TE>
<TE>   Milenski, who called Long Beach Opera "probably the most
improbable opera company in the United States," won't single out any
specific piece or season as emblematic: "I think we managed to keep a
fairly consistent artistic standard. What I'm proud of, too, is
persevering through these crises to make solid, uncompromising art."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the company has had no shortage of crises. On the artistic
side, in 1989, librettist Philip Littell demanded that his name be
taken off Mark McGurty's "The Guilty Mother" due to differences with
a director. In 1994, Milenski fired soprano Angela Reaux one week
before the opening of Verdi's "Falstaff," again over differences with
that production's directors.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit company is also well known for its ongoing money
problems. One major financial crisis came in 1996. The company
canceled two of its three productions that year, and then signed an
agreement with Cal State Long Beach, in which Milenski became a
lecturer at the school and Long Beach Opera got free use of rehearsal
space and the university's Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing
Arts Center. Milenski and the company will continue their
relationships with Cal State Long Beach after his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Since moving to the campus, Long Beach Opera has presented a
fortnight-long "festival," usually staging just two productions. The
budget for the June productions is about $500,000, according to
Milenski. Los Angeles Opera puts on eight operas a season, at a
budget of $32 million.</TE>
<TE>   Mitisek, who has conducted five productions for the company,
including last season's "Jenufa," by Janacek, called his appointment
"exciting, and scary, of course. The monetary situation is not good;
no one's monetary situation is good right now."</TE>
<TE>   Mitisek co-founded the avant-garde Vienna Opera Theater at age 25
and was its music director for six years. Milenski says he saw a
production there of John Adams' "Nixon in China" that started him
thinking of Mitisek has a possible heir. In between, Mitisek became
Long Beach Opera's principal conductor. The two began discussing a
formal handoff last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things audiences in Southern California will
appreciate is Andreas' ambition," Milenski says, explaining that the
conductor was planning to put on "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk' as his
first production until Los Angeles Opera, in collaboration with the
Kirov Opera, added it to its 2002-2003 season. "This is a boy who
thinks big."</TE>
<TE>   Mitisek says the company needs to stay true to its focused
mission, but he thinks growth is also important. "We need to become a
larger group -- right now they're doing two productions a year. It's
my strong belief that we need to go to three, so we are more present
throughout the year." He adds that this is unlikely to happen
immediately because of financial limits.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Mitisek's appointment, Christina Slenk, currently an
administrative assistant, will become administrator at Long Beach
Opera, and a production manager will be named later. All three will
handle Milenski's duties.</TE>
<TE>   As for his own role, Milenski will become general director
emeritus, leaving him time for his personal life, some teaching, and
an as yet unformed project meant to foster relationships between
librettists and composers. "My continuing relationship with Long
Beach Opera," he says, "will hopefully be honorary. I have 25 years
of experience and I will be happy to share it. But I will not have
formal input into the company."</TE>

<LD>Square Peg</LD>
<LD>   Confessions of a Citizen Senator</LD>
<LD>   Orrin Hatch</LD>
<TE>   Basic Books: 272 pages, $25</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the inevitable things that happens when you hold public
office, according to Sen. Orrin Hatch, is that "at some point, an old
friend will pull you aside in angry bewilderment and demand to know
when you lost your principles."</TE>
<TE>   "What they are really asking," he goes on to say, "is when did you
stop agreeing either with their opinion about a specific issue or,
more troubling, an opinion they presumed you shared. Their passion
often flows from the common assumption that their view and their view
alone is based on principle, and that adherence to a contrary
position can be the result of a hidden character flaw, stubborn
ignorance, or craven submission to political expediency."</TE>
<TE>   The Utah Republican, who'd been elected to the Senate in 1976 as
an ultraconservative, found himself being booed by an unruly bunch of
ultraconservatives at Utah's Republican 2000 convention. Despite his
solid record of supporting the rights of gun owners, Hatch's
co-sponsorship of a crime bill with Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy
containing some minor concessions on the matter of guns made him a
traitor in their eyes. In effect, what was being held against him
were his years of experience as a conscientious, skillful and
effective legislator.</TE>
<TE>   Although it bears the subtitle "Confessions of a Citizen Senator,"
Hatch's political memoir "Square Peg" does not belong to the
soul-baring, gut-spilling confessional genre. What it does do -- with
humor, acumen and a reasonable degree of candor -- is set forth its
author's general values and beliefs, explain how he got involved in
politics and offer a lucid, knowledgeable and illuminating account of
the workings of the political process.</TE>
<TE>   Hatch worked with California Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman
on the 1984 Orphan Drug Act to speed up approval on drugs to treat
rare diseases, as well as legislation on dietary supplements,
pharmaceutical patents and generic drugs. Together with Ted Kennedy,
Hatch drafted legislation to help states provide health insurance for
the children of the working poor.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Hatch, a staunch supporter of the anti-abortion
movement, incurred displeasure among the anti-abortionists because of
his well-reasoned and downright compassionate stand in favor of
regulated stem cell research.</TE>
<TE>   Both Democrats and Republicans could gain from reading this book.
This is equally true of those on the left who automatically and
indiscriminately hate and distrust all conservatives and those on the
right who demonize liberals and consider it treasonous for their
elected representatives to work with them. Many who might pigeonhole
Hatch as a single-minded politician might be amazed to learn from
this book that he is also a dedicated songwriter whose work has been
recorded by Gladys Knight, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Although himself one of the more conservative Republicans and
certainly no stranger to partisan politics, Hatch wants to remind us
that participating in the political process, putting together
coalitions and working out compromises with members of the other
party should not be branded as "selling out" one's principles.
Discussing Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords' decision to become a Democrat,
Hatch thinks Jeffords acted out of principle, not expediency: "The
principles and concerns most important to him were more closely
aligned with the ... Democrats than ... Republicans."</TE>
<TE>   But before going overboard in admiring Hatch's decency, integrity
and common sense, it should be noted that in discussing Jeffords'
party switch, he completely elides the little matter of the 2000
election, a vexed process that ended up giving the American people a
president who had actually received fewer popular votes than his
opponent. Then again, this question has been so consistently
downplayed by the supposedly "liberal" media, Hatch's elision is,
sadly, not all that egregious.</TE>
<TE>   Hatch's ability to see beyond labels is evident in his account of
the role played by the AFL-CIO in the defeat of communism. "One of
the front-line soldiers in the Cold War," he tells us, "was Irving
Brown, the AFL-CIO's representative in Europe." Based in Paris, a
friend of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Brown fought for
more than five decades to defend democracy and free trade unionism.
"In the late 1970s," Hatch recalls, "he came to see me, even though I
had recently led the opposition in defeating his organization's top
domestic priority, Labor Law Reform."</TE>
<TE>   When Brown told Hatch of Lech Walesa's Solidarity movement in
Poland, Hatch was willing to lend a hand. Yet Hatch also describes
his successful battle to defeat the union-backed Labor Law Reform
bill in 1978 as one of the signal accomplishments of his career. One
wonders what makes trade unions so attractive to him when they're in
Poland yet so repugnant when they're in America. Missing from this
memoir is a sense of how Hatch, a former Democrat and son of a union
man, came to see things so differently.</TE>
<TE>   Hatch also writes about his 2000 run for the Republican
presidential nomination. One of his more bizarre encounters with the
voting public occurs in Iowa, where Hatch, campaigning against George
W. Bush, is reprimanded by a man in the audience for being too hard
on the former president.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you're getting yourself a little confused," Hatch tried
to explain. "I was talking about Governor Bush, not the former
president. This time, it's the son who is running, not the father."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think so," the man replied. "You know, Bush looks good,
all rested up and ready to go, years younger than when he left
office." Which only goes to show that when some people have made up
their minds, no fact -- however obvious -- stands a chance of getting
through.</TE>

<HD>Shake-up in latte land</HD>
<DH>The licuado, mixing milk and fresh fruit, is becoming the
drink of the moment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maria Elena Fernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a drink so simple that probably the most amazing thing about it
is that it took this long to cross into the mainstream where
smoothies, milkshakes and Frappucinos flow.</LD>
<LD>   Here's how simple: Add fresh fruit to milk and blend.</LD>
<LD>   What you get is a licuado (pronounced lee-KWA-doh), traditionally
blended for breakfast, light meals and snacks in Latin America, but
now also being whipped up and served in restaurants in Hollywood and
L.A.'s trend-sensitive Westside.</LD>
<TE>   "This is as hot now as the music of J. Lo and Enrique Iglesias,"
says Los Angeles chef Toribio Prado, whose family owns the Cava,
Prado, Cha Cha Cha and Confete restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   So hot that it's caught the attention of the California Milk
Processor Board (the people who brought you "Got Milk?"), which
approached Prado about creating new licuado recipes that would appeal
to American taste buds. Already ads featuring licuados are running in
national magazines like In Style, People and Martha Stewart Living --
they show a blender with fruit in it just waiting for milk, and they
direct readers to the "Got Milk?" Web site, where Prado's recipes are
listed.</TE>
<TE>   The drinks can be made with whatever fruit is on hand -- but
popular choices include mango, papaya, guava, apple, mamey (a
football-shaped tropical berry), banana and berries.</TE>
<TE>   Long a staple in homes and restaurants in East L.A. and in Latino
communities around the country, the drink is also popularly served in
small licuado bars like the one at Sonora Bakery in East Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I come in every morning on my way to work to get my strawberry
licuado and my coffee because it's fast, very tasty and I know it's
good for me," said Jose Perez, 30, a furniture salesman who grew up
drinking licuados in Mexico. "I like to make them at home, too, but
it's faster to just come in here."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Manning, executive director of the California Milk Processor
Board, is always looking for new ways to market milk to consumers.
"There are a lot of ways the Hispanic community uses milk that the
general market doesn't," said Manning, citing flan, tres leches cake,
horchatas (rice-based drinks) and licuados. With licuados, he sees an
opportunity to cross cultural lines to expand milk's appeal to adults
and children. "Kids get very tired of milk. Instead of giving them a
Gatorade or Coke, licuados are full of flavor and yet it's still
eight ounces of milk."</TE>
<TE>   Prado, who came to California from Mexico when he was 14, sees the
drink as a way to share a part of his heritage. "We are a refined
race and culture, but many of our traditions were left in our
homelands when we came here," he says. "It's a beautiful thing to be
able to introduce something like this to the American palate."</TE>
<TE>   Although licuado is a contemporary name, the drink itself has been
consumed in Latin America since the 18th century. Before the
invention of the manual or electric blender, the instrument of choice
was a mortar, a wood or marble bowl used for mashing solids until
pureed. Unlike with the modern blender, it was essential with the
mortar that the fruit be very ripe to make it easier to mash.</TE>
<TE>   The taste, style and consistency of a licuado is very much a
reflection of who is blending the drink -- and sometimes goes way
beyond its simple roots.</TE>
<TE>   Prado has developed 16 recipes that range from classic
fruit-and-milk-based licuados to adventurous concoctions that call
for peanut butter and peppermint. His "Fiesta Licuado" contains
orange juice, pineapple juice and peaches; his "Icy Pink" consists of
strawberry ice cream and guava syrup. "Sometimes I even put liquor in
them and send them as shots to the tables. You can get very creative
with this beverage."</TE>
<TE>   The drinks are now on the menu at Cha Cha Cha on Virgil Avenue and
soon will be added at Confete on Santa Monica Boulevard. And Prado
plans to open licuado bars in malls elsewhere in Southern California
-- he envisions shoppers browsing with licuados instead of lattes in
their hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a bit ridiculous mixing shakes, but I'm proud of
representing my culture this way," Prado said. "In Mexico, licuados
are a cultural staple. You drink them with your family and your
friends. They're refreshing, but they're also very nutritious."</TE>
<TE>   Also called batidos (bah-TEE-dohs), licuado mixes are sold in
supermarkets, but, says Manning of the milk board, those miss the
mark by leaving out the most important element of a licuado: its
freshness and innate nutritional value.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why we're sticking to the traditional preparation" in
promoting the drink, Manning said. "One of the magical things about
making licuados at home is that you can basically make everything you
want. My wife is a chocolate person. She'll start with a banana and,
lo and behold, in will go three or four ounces of chocolate and a bit
of cream and the whole thing gets pretty indulgent quickly. The
traditional licuado is very healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Mexican restaurants throughout Los Angeles, like El Burrito on
Hollywood Boulevard, have offered the traditional fruit-and-milk
licuados for many years. In downtown L.A., Roberto Ceballos makes a
good living selling sandwiches, fresh juices and licuados at his tiny
Doreen's Cafe.</TE>
<TE>   Rachelle Williams, human resources director at the Mexican
American Legal and Educational Defense Fund, stops in at Doreen's for
papaya, mango and strawberry licuados during her lunch hour several
times a week.</TE>
<TE>   The reason, like the drink itself, is simple, she says: "It
satisfies the sweet tooth, but I feel it's nutritious and healthy ...
and it tastes very good."</TE>

<TE>   I'm afraid of snakes because I worry that they will bite me or
squeeze me to death. I am OK if they are in their cages, but when
they aren't, I get scared. I am also scared of the movie "Anaconda."
I am not the type to watch snake movies, but they are amazing
reptiles. I am fond of the colors in some snakes. I am also fond of
cobras. They are pretty but scary.</TE>

<HD>When the audience is scarier than the movie</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>I challenged movie demographics the other night and ended up in
teenage hell. It wasn't so much the film, which was "The Ring," but
the audience. Ninety percent of it consisted of those between the
ages of 13 and 16, and they were there to be heard.</LD>
<LD>   It's this way: My wife is out of town for a few days, and we have
this deal that when she's gone I can eat whatever I want and see
every lousy movie around. So after fixing myself a delicious dinner
of tuna and okra topped with ketchup, I hustled into Woodland Hills
to see "The Ring."</LD>
<LD>   I'm kind of a scary-movie nut and will make an effort to take in
the horror flick of the moment, even though I am advised against it
by everyone I know with an IQ over 75. Cinelli aspires to a higher
form of art and would rather spend eight hours at an auto-da-fe than
two hours at my kind of movie.</LD>
<TE>   But when she took off to see our daughter up north, I went to a
theater at the mall. I should have known right away that I might be
in for a new experience. The area was crawling with teenagers. Girls
with their navels exposed. Boys with their trousers falling off. The
noise was overwhelming and the sight disorienting.</TE>
<TE>   At first, I was cowed by the calamitous display of pubescent
disorder, glands exploding everywhere. But then I figured that God
had put me there for a purpose. I would study teenage behavior the
way anthropologist Margaret Mead had studied the mating habits of
South Sea islanders. She wrote "Coming of Age in Samoa." I could
write "Coming of Age at the Mall."</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't informed until later that "The Ring" was really for
squirming, wiggling young people, not for mature, skeptical adults.
The kids fit the intended demographics. I didn't know much about the
film except that it was supposed to be steeped in horror. I figured
that meant a teenage girl left home alone without pizza. She runs
screaming through the streets and is killed by a masked guy with a
boat hook. The end.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ring" is more complicated than that, although one is required
to suspend disbelief in order to accept it. But if you can buy a
talking mouse named Mickey, you can believe that a girl can return
from the dead to indiscriminately murder everyone in sight.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately upon entering the theater, I was startled by a
sudden, earsplitting scream behind me, so shrill I almost dropped my
hot dog. The first scream was followed by an answering scream, and
out of nowhere, two teenage girls rushed together like sisters
separated by a war.</TE>
<TE>   I learned that evening that the screams are a traditional greeting
among humans of that age and that gender. Even though they may have
seen each other that day in school, the fact that they meet again
unexpectedly requires a high squeal of recognition and then wild
hugs. And there were many greetings that night.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the boys. They came into the theater swaggering and
bellowing like drunks at a football game. Had they been bare-chested
with the name of the movie spray-painted across their bellies, I
would not have been surprised.</TE>
<TE>   The bellowing and the shouting, fueled by testosterone, reached a
decibel level equal to departing jets. The purpose of their noise was
quite obviously to attract the people who were screaming. I noticed
that the girls didn't scream at the boys but at each other, and the
boys didn't scream directly at the girls or even at each other, but
just sort of bellowed upward, like a bull speared by picadors.</TE>
<TE>   Another element of teenage behavior I noticed was that of
continuous movement. I don't know that any of you ever saw "The Snake
Pit," about conditions in what was known then as an insane asylum.
There was an overhead shot that showed a bunch of the patients in a
circular room, moving and pacing and muttering. The camera kept
pulling back and back until they resembled snakes in a pit.</TE>
<TE>   The teen movement at "The Ring" was similar. They were unable to
sit still and unable to keep quiet even when the movie began. The
noise was muted to some extent but the milling about never ceased. I
don't know what they did exactly, or even if they knew, but they'd go
here and there and see someone they hadn't seen and do something
they'd never do at home.</TE>
<TE>   After the movie, the screaming and bellowing began anew, but I had
observed their behavior long enough, so I left while my sanity was
still intact. I don't recall that much about the movie. Oh, it was
scary, all right, but not half as scary as being surrounded by --
shudder -- all of those raging hormones.</TE>

the deck to come up with a series with staying power.</DH>

<LD>The year was 1995, and for the creative team behind the fledgling
sitcom "NewsRadio," the news was all good. On the strength of the
pilot episode, the show had been given the green light from NBC, and
a March premiere date was penciled in.</LD>
<LD>   But there was one nagging problem. Some executives close to the
show thought one of the ensemble characters, a technician named
"Ted," wasn't quite right, and they decided to replace him with
comedian and actor Joe Rogan. The character was renamed "Joe," and
the popular series would roll merrily along for five seasons and
nearly 100 episodes.</LD>
<LD>   After the show had run its course, Rogan's good fortune continued,
and he eventually landed another high-visibility assignment as host
of the current NBC ratings juggernaut "Fear Factor." As for the
actor-comedian who lost out after playing "Ted" in the "NewsRadio"
pilot, he bounced around making spot appearances on talk shows, until
one evening on "Late Night With David Letterman," the actor so
impressed the host that the comic was staked to another shot at a
series.</LD>
<TE>   This time, Ray Romano managed to hang around past the pilot stage,
and since 1996, his "Everybody Loves Raymond" series has become CBS'
gold standard for sitcom success.</TE>
<TE>   Casting changes don't always turn out so neatly, however, and for
that reason -- and many others -- it may be among the most avoided
topics in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the new fall series underwent significant personnel
shuffling in their first weeks, perhaps most interestingly in the ABC
sitcom "Life With Bonnie," starring Bonnie Hunt. The actress has said
that she originally wrote the role of her doctor-husband for longtime
pal Mark Derwin, but when he had problems getting released from his
duties on the daytime soap "One Life to Live," Brian Kerwin ("Beggars
and Choosers") was brought in to take over.</TE>
<TE>   Kerwin was on board for the pilot episode, but shortly thereafter,
Derwin discovered that his soap opera character had suddenly slipped
into a coma, and he was available again. So Kerwin was sent packing,
the pilot was reshot with Derwin, and the series got off to a solid
start in the ratings.</TE>
<TE>   But the strong numbers out of the chute didn't make the subject
any more palatable for Derwin or Hunt, normally among the most
approachable of stars. Both declined interview requests on the topic,
yet back in July, during a gathering of national television critics
in Pasadena, Hunt and Derwin did touch on the changes.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, you know, Mark and I worked together on [1995's] 'The
Bonnie Hunt Show,' and we wanted him from the beginning to be in this
role," said Hunt. "He wasn't available. Brian was. And Brian kind of
knew that maybe it would change. If that worked out, it was OK with
Mark because he was working on 'One Life to Live.' But the greatest
moment was when I called Mark and I said, 'You know, I think the
network is going to make a change, and we're going to bring you in.'
And he said, 'Oh, it's perfect timing, because my [soap opera] wife
just threw me out a window and I'm in a coma.' "</TE>
<TE>   Derwin sounded a little unsure that the changes would stick.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you know, that's up to ABC," he said at the same press
gathering. "I just want to thank them for allowing me to come and do
this show, because I'm in the middle of a contract with 'One Life to
Live,' and for them to allow me to work with Bonnie again, I couldn't
be more grateful. I think they have some thoughts on that, but right
now, my coma is so deep that who knows when I'll wake up."</TE>
<TE>   As for the ousted Kerwin, he may go on to have Romano-sized
success of his own, but for now his press rep said he won't be
discussing the situation.</TE>
<TE>   The thinking in Hollywood seems to be that if you are on the
losing end of such a talent upheaval, you don't want to advertise the
fact any more than necessary. And even if you're the actor who comes
out on top, waxing gleeful in an interview might be perceived as
dancing on someone else's grave. Merely trying to eke out a living as
an actor is enough to give anyone a healthy dose of paranoia, and a
positive outcome one day could easily turn around and bite you the
next.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure on "Life With Bonnie" may be more acute than
elsewhere because of ABC's need for new hits, and indeed, as the
ratings softened, the series' writing staff was cut loose after just
a handful of shows.</TE>
<TE>   With the season well under way, the other networks have some
evidence for how their own changes are panning out. On the WB's
"Birds of Prey," Sherilyn Fenn ("Twin Peaks") was dropped in favor of
Mia Sara after filming the pilot. The same network's resurrection of
the 1960s series "Family Affair" began with Luke Benward in the role
of Jody for the hourlong opening episode, only to switch -- without
explanation -- to Jimmy "Jax" Pinchak for subsequent episodes.</TE>
<TE>   After filming the pilot, "Good Morning, Miami" swapped Burke Moses
as its pompous talk-show host Gavin Stone for Matt Letscher, thought
to be a better love match for the show's criminally cute hairdresser
played by Ashley Williams.</TE>
<TE>   You almost needed a scorecard to keep track of the early changes
in Fox's "John Doe." Out: Meat Loaf Aday, Elizabeth Lackey and Azura
Skye. In: William Forsythe, Jayne Brooks and Sprague Grayden,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Cast in, cast out. In network television, plugging the right
actors into the right roles is always a work in progress.</TE>

<HD>Roles crafted in clay</HD>
<DH>Helping to put together their own masks in a theater
production of "Animal Farm" gave the actors a better feel for their
characters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Nehring compares making the canvas mask he wears as Napoleon,
the tyrannical pig in "Animal Farm," to the experience of delivering
a baby.</LD>
<LD>   He cut the mask off the wet clay that shaped it, and "it was like
doing a caesarean section," he said. He cleaned it, repatched it,
strengthened it, attached foam and a strap to it. "I know it so well
because I helped give birth to it," he said. "It was a huge,
cathartic experience."</LD>
<LD>   Several of the other actors in the Son of Semele production of the
dramatization of George Orwell's classic fable (which opened Friday)
had similar experiences, said mask maestro Deborah Bird, who designed
most of the show's 23 masks and mask-like puppets and painted all of
them. She believes the actors' performances will profit from their
hands-on contributions to their masks.</LD>
<TE>   "Performing in masks is so uncomfortable," she said. "It occludes
vision and breathing, and it makes you sweat off the top of your
head. But if you work on it and see it come to life, you have a
proprietary sense of pride. It helps when you go into rehearsal. You
develop a comfort level with it, and you also develop a reverence for
it. You know not to treat it like some sort of hat."</TE>
<TE>   Bird, who won an LA Weekly award for her human masks in a
production of "The Call of the Wild" and who also creates masks and
props in Hollywood, didn't have much experience designing animal
masks when Son of Semele artistic director Matthew McCray asked her
to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Animals usually are depicted as "cutified, infantilized" cartoons,
she said. "Animal Farm" called for masks "with ambiguity, with
duality of features that can be filled in with the weight of the
actor's performance."</TE>
<TE>   Nehring, who is the chairman of theater and dance department at
Orange's Chapman University, from which Son of Semele's core group
graduated, had met Bird in Bali at a theater workshop in the mid-'90s
and brought her work to the attention of the group.</TE>
<TE>   With a production budget of only $6,000 for a three-week run at
the 50-seat McCadden Place Theatre in Hollywood, Son of Semele had no
money to pay Bird, but, she said, "I really like Orwell."</TE>
<TE>   And McCray said he never thought of doing the show without masks
-- because a key moment in the play is when the pigs remove their
masks, having morphed into the abusive humans they had once
overthrown.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the company donated a Hollywood garage for use as a
studio, and Bird began working in June, joined by some of the actors
in September.</TE>
<TE>   For Nehring, "it's a completely different way of working on
character because it's embodied in this potent symbol. I couldn't be
more anonymous."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>All day Saturday, Albert Higgins and his father worked on the
birdhouse.</LD>
<LD>   "Look at this," Albert said, as he held up a spiral piece of wood
with holes in it. Cool! It was no bigger than his thumb. It was all
that was left after they'd cut away a lot of useful boards. "I think
it'll be my good-luck piece," Albert said as he put the oddly shaped
hunk of wood into his pocket.</LD>
<LD>   The next day, when Albert's parents took him to a Big Griddle
restaurant for breakfast, he carried his good-luck piece with him.</LD>
<TE>   Big Griddle pancake restaurants were found all over the country.
They were easy to see -- big circular buildings with fiery red tiles
on top. Over the door of each restaurant was a sign that said, "The
Big Griddle -- Just Like Home." The only thing different about this
particular Big Griddle was the old pepper tree growing out in front.</TE>
<TE>   After a big breakfast of pancakes and sausages and eggs, Mrs.
Higgins sent Albert to the restroom to wash the syrup off his hands
and face. When he came out of the restroom he saw a rack of picture
postcards hanging on the wall opposite the door. The postcards were
free.</TE>
<TE>   Albert pulled out a postcard that had slipped down between the
rack and the wall. It showed a Big Griddle -- Just Like Home
restaurant on the landscape of an alien planet. Cool. He studied it
as he walked through the door into the restaurant's dining room.</TE>
<TE>   When he looked up, he was surprised that the windows didn't
overlook the pepper tree or the busy street outside. Worst of all,
his parents were gone!</TE>
<TE>   Were those space aliens he saw? They stood at the far end of the
dining room and were arguing among themselves. They rushed toward
Albert, waving their arms.</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow: OK. What's going on?</TE>

<HD>Even a nostalgic guest turn can't help a lackluster
'Parkers'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Sandell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Parkers" on UPN has long been a case of different strokes for
different folks. Once the highest-rated sitcom among African
Americans, it also drew harsh criticism a couple of years back from
director Spike Lee, who said the stereotypes in it weren't much
different from those in the minstrel shows he skewered in the film
"Bamboozled."</LD>
<LD>   Now stuck in the doldrums of its fourth season and rightfully
trumped in the Nielsen ratings by programs such as ABC's "My Wife and
Kids" and Fox's "The Bernie Mac Show" and "Cedric the Entertainer
Presents," "The Parkers" can only hope that a little TV nostalgia
will give it a boost tonight at 8, with a guest turn by Gary Coleman.</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, the onetime darling of "Diff'rent Strokes" who
always wanted to know what his older brother Willis was talkin'
about, is portraying himself. Since his signature show ended its run
in 1986, Coleman has played Coleman on "Married ... With Children,"
"The Simpsons," "The Hughleys" and "My Wife and Kids" -- not to
mention having appeared in the TV courtroom of Judge Mills Lane, who
ordered him to pay an autograph-seeking fan $1,665 for hospital bills
resulting from a fight at a Hawthorne store.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight, Coleman moves in as a neighbor to Nikki (Mo'Nique) and
Kim Parker (Countess Vaughn), the mother-and-daughter duo around whom
this "Moesha" spinoff revolves. He is happily working in a community
theater production, until Nikki intervenes with plans to revive his
career through a cable-access talk show that is ill-conceived at
best.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, pretty much the same can be said of "The Parkers,"
with its lackluster writing and, oh yes, those stereotypes, which
might be redeemed if this were incisive social commentary rather than
broad comedy. But how much can anyone expect from a series about a
mother and daughter in college together that virtually never shows
them attending class or studying?</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it would seem that the truly learned one here is Coleman,
who can take the money from his guest appearance and run.</TE>

<HD>Relief from sleep apnea</HD>
<DH>The disorder can be a nightmare of breathing interruptions
leading to serious afflictions. But there are therapies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gary Stewart never had trouble falling asleep, but he seldom felt
rested, even after a full night's sleep. Then there was the nightly
racket of his snoring. Stewart sought treatment late last year after
adding 45 pounds to his 230-pound frame. The extra weight further
constricted his breathing passages and made it even more difficult to
get a restful sleep. His worsening condition left him sluggish,
sleepy and depressed.</LD>
<LD>   "Trying to watch 'Lord of the Rings' without falling asleep was
nearly impossible," said Stewart, a record company executive in his
40s. "And those art films at the Laemmle's [movie theaters], forget
it."</LD>
<LD>   In January, after a physician's recommendation, Stewart underwent
a polysomnogram, or sleep study. He was diagnosed with sleep apnea, a
condition characterized by brief breathing interruptions during
sleep. An estimated 20 million Americans suffer from the condition,
whose symptoms range from the merely annoying to the potentially
deadly.</LD>
<TE>   The most common signs of the disorder are morning headaches, loud
snoring, irritability and difficulty concentrating. Left undiagnosed
or untreated, it can cause high blood pressure, sexual dysfunction
and depression. People with sleep apnea often have difficulty staying
awake at work, or may fall asleep at inappropriate times. They are
three times more likely to be involved in an automobile accident.</TE>
<TE>   A sleep study, which costs about $1,500 and is usually covered by
health insurance, is often used to diagnose the condition. The study,
in which the patient is monitored by medical specialists while
sleeping, measures bodily functions such as brain waves, eye
movement, heart rate and air flow. In a patient like Stewart, in
which sleep apnea is suspected, doctors are especially watching for
halts in breathing. "Everyone, including myself, has a breathing
pause during sleep," said Dr. Frisca L. Yan-Go, medical director of
the Sleep Disorders Center at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   She explains that as many as five breathing pauses an hour,
lasting a few seconds, are normal. But people with sleep apnea may
have as many as 60 stoppages, lasting 10 seconds or more in severe
cases. The interruptions trigger a "fight or flight" response in the
brain, rousing the person from sleep in order to breathe again. These
frequent stoppages can prevent a person from obtaining so-called REM
(rapid eye movement) sleep, which is essential for feeling properly
rested.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, a patient has to spend the night in a sleep clinic
to be tested. At the UCLA clinic, patients typically arrive an hour
or so before their normal bedtime. The patient then spends the next
30 to 40 minutes being outfitted with electrodes for sleep. The
monitoring devices are affixed to the head, chest and legs. (The
latter helps measure restlessness during sleep, even though the sleep
sessions often are videotaped as well.)</TE>
<TE>   To supplement the medical data, patients are also asked to keep a
written daily record that includes their bedtime, how long it took
them to fall asleep and total hours slept. Also, spouses or
roommates, who are often the first ones to sound the alarm about the
condition, are asked to fill out a questionnaire to track such traits
as snoring volume, restlessness and teeth grinding. Their months or
years of complaining about wall-rattling snoring will be validated in
the sleep study, which provides a printout of snoring volume.
Stewart's study showed he had severe sleep apnea. He stopped
breathing during sleep as many as 60 times an hour.</TE>
<TE>   The question now was treatment. Like many patients, Stewart opted
for continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, therapy. The
therapy consists of wearing headgear and a mask hooked up to a
shoebox-size machine that delivers pressurized air to the sleeper.
The constant and continuous forced air helps prevent breathing pauses
by keeping the nasal passages open.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the CPAP, Stewart also considered surgery. There
are several procedures to attack the problem, but the most common one
calls for the removal of excess tissue at the back of the throat. The
surgery can be quite painful and is thought to be effective in only
30% to 60% of cases.</TE>
<TE>   But sleeping every night with a mask over your face has obvious
drawbacks. "Just picture yourself as the Dennis Hopper character in
'Blue Velvet,' " jokes Stewart, adding, "Actually, it's not that
bad."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart experienced some common problems with CPAP, still
considered one of the most effective treatments for sleep apnea.
After more than six months of using the therapy, he is still making
minor adjustments with the mask and the intensity of the airflow.</TE>
<TE>   Problems with CPAP are fairly common, and as many as one in four
patients at the UCLA clinic eventually quits the therapy in
frustration, said Yan-Go. Dropout rates can run much higher at other
clinics if patients receive little training on the proper use of the
device, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But another sleep apnea sufferer, Joanne Murphy of Rancho Santa
Fe, found great relief in one of the several variations of the CPAP
device, known as the bi-level positive airway pressure, or BPAP,
machine. The bi-level simply supplies more pressurized air breathing
in than out, thus reducing the often disconcerting feeling of
exhaling into a wind.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference for me was like night and day," said Murphy, 50, a
former saleswoman and singer. "You wake up and you don't ache, you
feel rested and it's like, 'Oh, my God. It's a beautiful morning. Is
this how everyone else feels?' "</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, meantime, says life is "slightly to noticeably better"
since beginning therapy. He is also pursuing lifestyle changes meant
to further mitigate his symptoms. The single man is trying to lose
weight and exercise more frequently.</TE>
<TE>   "Women want a man that sleeps well," he said. "Sleep-ism is really
an underrated phenomenon."</TE>

<HD>Historic club seeks secret of youth</HD>
<DH>Long a refuge for the elite, the L.A. Athletic Club looks
to keep its traditional members yet lure a younger crowd.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For nearly 60 years Wafe Risner has been making his four-day-a-week
trek to the Los Angeles Athletic Club. Every Tuesday, Thursday,
Saturday and Sunday the 90-year-old Pasadena retired aircraft
industry executive hits the sauna, the handball courts, and does a
lap on the indoor track. He ends the day with a beer he keeps in the
refrigerator in a private dressing area.</LD>
<LD>   Priya Sopori, a 29-year-old corporate lawyer, has a rather
different workout regime at the downtown club. Nearly every weekday
morning she spends 45 minutes on an elliptical trainer or treadmill,
30 minutes doing weights and occasionally attends a yoga class. After
a shower, she heads back to her downtown law office.</LD>
<LD>   This is the membership of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, a
122-year-old private club straddling two worlds and struggling to
live in both. Begun by the city's founding fathers, it has prided
itself for years on attracting the best and brightest. Telltale
remnants of the past are found in the hunter green carpets, dark wood
bars, high-ceilinged banquet halls and hotel rooms. But there's also
a small business center with Internet access, a Pilates studio and
high-tech cardiovascular machines.</LD>
<TE>   As the club tries to hang on to the old guard while recruiting the
new, a question looms: Is a private club like the LAAC still relevant
in the 21st century? Other private athletic clubs around the U.S. are
also experiencing growing pains, including the Indianapolis Athletic
Club and New York's Downtown Athletic Club, which has long been mired
in financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely seeing venerable private athletic clubs under
siege," says Bill Howland, director of research for the Boston-based
International Health, Racquet &amp; Sportsclub Assn., a nonprofit trade
group. "They're facing head-to-head competition from places like the
Sports Club/LA, which positions itself as an urban country club.
They're having to not only re-evaluate their physical plant, but the
services they offer as well. A few decades ago they were about the
two-martini lunch, and now people want to be able to bring their
clients to play squash and then have a vegetarian lunch."</TE>
<TE>   For a club like the LAAC to thrive, suggests Howland, it needs to
take a cue from commercial clubs that are carving out a following in
a competitive market: "Crunch is edgy, the San Francisco Bay Club is
a downtown, white-collar club, and some clubs appeal to families," he
says. "If these older athletic clubs do the same kind of thing,
figure out what kind of services they have that meet the market need,
then they can achieve relevancy. If you talk to the people behind
Sports Club/LA and see how much thought went into the color schemes
and the staff uniforms, they don't leave anything to chance. I don't
know that these private clubs historically have operated this way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Club of power brokers</TE>
<TE>   In 1880 the Athletic Club opened its first location on Spring
Street, founded by 40 prominent citizens on a motto of "health,
recreation, grace and vigor." The initiation fee was $5, monthly dues
were $1, and gymnasium equipment included a trapeze, flying rings, a
long horse and dumbbells. Women were permitted only at social events
and exhibitions. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
the club's location changed but its roster always included the city's
power brokers, names such as Huntington, Doheny, Chandler, O'Melveny,
Dockweiler and Slauson. And there was an array of celebrities,
including Mary Pickford, Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and
Charlie Chaplin.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1920s the club expanded along with the city, opening
the California Yacht Club in San Pedro, a gun club near Bakersfield
and the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades. It also purchased
a number of struggling health clubs around town, but when war came in
the 1940s membership dropped and some of those acquired clubs were
sold.</TE>
<TE>   The LAAC underwent a major overhaul in the 1950s, adding new
pools, equipment and strengthening its athletic programs. It became a
training ground for Olympic athletes, and the club began to add
ethnic members. Membership peaked at about 5,000 in the 1970s, as
L.A.'s downtown boomed. But recessions, tax law changes and the
flight of corporate headquarters from downtown during the next two
decades eroded the club's numbers. By 1995, it counted only 2,700
members, about the same as it has today.</TE>
<TE>   Not half-a-mile away from the LAAC is a new Gold's Gym franchise,
just over a year old, with a pool, boxing ring, spa services and
saunas. It's competing for the same downtown office workers and loft
dwellers as the LAAC, says Ben Amante, Gold's senior vice president
of franchising, who boasts that the gym's "hip, up-to-date" facility
is a draw. Already, Gold's has 5,200 members -- nearly double the
number at LAAC -- including a few defectors from the venerable
downtown club, Amante says.</TE>
<TE>   Cory Hathaway knows he has an uphill climb to increase the club's
population, but he doesn't seem that worried, even with 150 gyms
within a 10-mile radius of the Athletic Club. The gangly 26-year-old
director of sales and marketing is also a sixth-generation
member--his father is Charles Hathaway, president of parent company
LAACO -- and he's got power players like developer Tom Gilmore on his
side. Gilmore, a club member for five years, has been buying up
downtown property for years. LAAC brochures are distributed in
Gilmore's buildings and others in the area that attract a younger,
more affluent resident. Members pay a $500 initiation fee and $140
per month; those under 30 are eligible for a discount.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of LAAC's membership are men, and the average age of
members is 50, according to Hathaway. Recruiting younger people
hasn't been "terribly tough," he says, as some who have moved
downtown have been receptive to the club's offerings, which include
opportunities for professional networking, plus restaurants, shops
and spas -- features not found in every commercial health club. One
problem, however, has been the transient nature of downtown dwellers,
who may last only one year before moving elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   New programs designed to appeal to younger members are in the
works, including televising Laker games and holding a monthly
"younger bar night" for people in the 20s-to-40s age groups.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Touring the building</TE>
<TE>   Hathaway believes the club's storied past appeals to a generation
that knows Slauson only as a street and Huntington as a museum: "We
really emphasize the history," he says. "It's like you've stepped
back in time, and it creates a distinctive style." A photo from the
club's archives shows men and women dining in a banquet hall
decorated with stuffed animal heads. The men are in coats and ties,
the women in flowery dresses.</TE>
<TE>   Dress codes today are casual or business casual; business attire
is required only for some club events.</TE>
<TE>   Hathaway leads a tour of the 12-story building, which is showing
its age in this shabby downtown jewelry district. The main fitness
area is in a spacious, open room with skylights and an array of
updated cardiovascular and weight machines, rowing machines and free
weights. Rusted light fixtures hang above the basketball court and
the pools, where a few people are doing laps.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurants, bars and meeting rooms have a men's-club look and
feel dated with decor that smacks of high style -- circa early 1980s.
Hathaway says the club is being remodeled, step by step, with plans
for a larger business center and a renovated rooftop.</TE>
<TE>   The old guard, like Risner, don't seem to mind the changes. He
describes the club back in 1943 as "more austere. The clothing
regulations were closely monitored but the atmosphere wasn't
oppressive." He finds it "very difficult to imagine" what his life
would have been like without the camaraderie of his regular handball
games at the club. "In that private locker, we'd do a lot of
socializing," he says. "There were a lot of tall stories. It's been
my home away from home."</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately, the future of the club will depend on its success
at attracting younger members like Sopori, an attorney with the
downtown law firm Quinn Emanuel.</TE>
<TE>   Sopori, whose family is from India, says she was initially
concerned about whether an exclusive club would welcome people from
different backgrounds. "I'm from a typical immigrant family, we never
belonged to a private gym," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "I never heard anything but positive comments from people. I was
looking for a place I could go with other professionals, not the kind
of place where women wear makeup to work out," she adds.</TE>
<TE>   Although she hasn't participated in many of the club's social
functions, she's happy with the friendships she's made with fellow
members: "You can have incredibly interesting conversations here.
Everyone has led a pretty full life."</TE>

<HD>'Where' can be more critical than 'why' in bypass surgery</HD>
<DH>Referrals for the procedure vary greatly from region to
region, depending on how assertive or conservative a doctor may be,
researchers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many patients might assume that when doctors recommend a relatively
common surgical procedure such as a heart bypass, they are using some
standard set of criteria. In reality, however, your chance of being
referred for this operation varies dramatically depending on where
you live and the way local doctors practice.</LD>
<LD>   This fact is highlighted by recent news of a federal investigation
into allegations that two doctors at a Redding hospital urged
patients to undergo heart surgeries they didn't need.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation at Redding Medical Center was sparked by a
complaint from a patient told he needed a triple-bypass; five other
cardiologists told him it wasn't required.</LD>
<TE>   Yet health care researchers and cardiologists say that the
decision whether to operate often comes down to a judgment call.</TE>
<TE>   Among the variables are the doctor's training, skill and practice
philosophy, whether local doctors perform less-invasive and
less-expensive angioplasties to open clogged arteries, along with the
patient's condition and willingness to undergo potentially risky
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at Dartmouth University in Hanover, N.H., have long
studied these variations in health care and compiled them in the
Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, first published in 1996. The
differences in various parts of the country can be dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in a 1999 study of Medicare recipients who underwent
heart bypasses, the researchers found that the average national rate
was 6.6 procedures per 1,000 people. The highest rate in the nation
was 11.4 procedures per 1,000 people in Mobile, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   The Redding area had the highest rate in California -- and the
third highest in the nation -- at 10.8 procedures per 1,000. The
state's lowest rate was the Palm Springs and Rancho Mirage area, with
4.1 per 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Redding's rate appears "excessive," said Megan Cooper, co-editor
of the Dartmouth Atlas. The high rate, however, doesn't necessarily
support the idea that a lot of unwarranted surgery occurred in
Redding. Rates in communities may be heavily influenced by a single
large heart center that performs a large number of procedures. Still,
Cooper said Redding's high rate should raise a red flag and cause
health officials to take a closer look "at what their selection
criteria are."</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of definitive science, practice patterns often are
based more on doctors' experience or that of their colleagues. "You
don't have slam-dunk evidence about whether bypass surgery extends
life expectancy," Cooper said. "You're starting to get some now."</TE>
<TE>   Research shows that bypass prolongs the lives of patients with
blockages of the left main artery, which frequently lead to fatal
heart attacks, and the procedure clearly relieves chest pain.</TE>
<TE>   But bypass patients also face significant surgical risks, long
recovery and rehabilitation and potential long-term memory problems.</TE>
<TE>   If your doctor has recommended bypass surgery, but your case is
not considered an emergency, it's wise to seek a second opinion from
a cardiologist at a different institution or medical practice, said
Dr. Gerald M. Pohost, chief of cardiovascular medicine at USC's Keck
School of Medicine in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Choose someone who doesn't perform invasive procedures so he or
she doesn't have a vested interest in your decision.</TE>
<TE>   You should be evaluated with diagnostic testing, but be aware that
results are subject to interpretation. You typically begin with a
cardiac stress test, during which an electrocardiogram can pick up
signs of abnormalities in blood flow, heart rhythm or blood pressure.
These can indicate the severity of your condition.</TE>
<TE>   If you develop chest pain during a stress test, you may be sent
for a nuclear stress test, or nuclear scan, to determine how your
heart is functioning. You're given an infusion of radioactive dye,
which should create an image in which most of the heart muscle
appears bright, while areas with too little blood flow show up as
"cold spots."</TE>
<TE>   A doctor may then recommend medication. Or, if the tests suggest
extensive disease, the doctor may recommend an angiogram, in which a
catheter is snaked inside the arteries to assess how badly they're
blocked.</TE>
<TE>   The angiogram is key because it documents the degree of impaired
blood flow, called ischemia, said Dr. Timothy D. Henry, research
director at the Minneapolis Heart Institute.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the cardiologist may recommend an angioplasty, a
procedure in which a balloon-like device is used to open the artery
and a small mesh tube, called a stent, is inserted to hold the artery
open.</TE>
<TE>   Here's where the judgment and experience of the cardiologist come
into play. Most perform an angioplasty when just one or two vessels
are blocked; those with more experience and skill will work on three
vessels.</TE>
<TE>   Bypass surgery usually is recommended when the left main artery or
left anterior descending artery are badly blocked, because these
blockages can kill you, or if there are multiple blockages,
especially in a diabetic patient.</TE>
<TE>   "There is black and white, but there's a lot of gray," Pohost
said. How often are patients referred for surgery when they don't
need it?: "That's very difficult to answer," he said. "The standards
for whether somebody needs surgery versus other intervention or
medication are not well-established."</TE>
<TE>   Henry said cardiologists as a group are conducting studies to
determine the best option.</TE>
<TE>   Although an angioplasty may cost half as much as bypass surgery
initially, several studies have found that angioplasties often must
be repeated, making the five-year costs of the two approaches nearly
comparable. Mortality rates also are comparable, except in diabetics,
who tend to do better with bypass surgery.</TE>

<TE>   How heart surgery rates vary</TE>
<TE>   Research has shown that the likelihood that someone will undergo
cardiac bypass surgery can vary significantly among communities,
based on the way local doctors practice. Below are bypass surgery
rates for select California communities, based on Medicare data for
1999.</TE>

<LD>For the first time, researchers have a likely explanation for why
even modest calorie restriction is so beneficial for overweight
people. At Emory University in Atlanta, scientists found that even
losing less than 10% of one's body weight can significantly reduce
the activity of an enzyme that affects blood pressure.</LD>
<LD>   The enzyme, called ACE for angiotensin-converting enzyme, is found
in the cells lining blood vessels. The protein it helps produce
causes arteries to contract, raising blood pressure. Because ACE is
produced by fatty tissue, the researchers reasoned that losing fat
would diminish ACE and lower blood pressure in overweight people.</LD>
<LD>   Sixteen healthy but overweight and sedentary people participated
in the study, eating 40% fewer calories in meals prepared by the
research center's kitchen for five weeks. They lost a modest 6% to 7%
of their body weight on average. But their blood pressure dropped
significantly, falling about 10 millimeters of mercury on average.
All but three participants had a 15% decrease in ACE.</LD>

<HD>Teens with signs of ADD may just be sleepy</HD>

<LD>Not all sleepy teenagers are sluggish and hard to get out the door in
the morning. Some may be hyperactive and exhibit other signs of
attention deficit disorder, such as difficulty focusing and being
hard to control, says Dr. David W. Kaplan, chairman of the American
Academy of Pediatrics committee on adolescence.</LD>
<LD>   Sleep deprivation in teenagers is considered such a serious
problem that a session was devoted to it during a recent academy
meeting. Kaplan, who had reviewed the scientific literature on the
subject, reported that children over 12 need at least 8.5 hours of
sleep a night. "We have no idea whether some kids are being
misdiagnosed as having ADD when they just have serious sleep
deprivation," he said in an interview.</LD>
<LD>   Like adults, teenagers' schedules and activities -- not to mention
cell phones and computers and TVs in the bedroom -- are encroaching
on their sleep time, says Kaplan.</LD>
<TE>   As part of its "Sleep Well, Do Well: Star Sleeper Campaign," the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute offers parents tips on how
to help children get a good night's sleep: Establish a regular
bedtime, eliminate distractions from the bedroom, and avoid sodas and
other beverages with caffeine less than six hours before bedtime.</TE>

<HD>Implant is the latest in birth control</HD>
<DH>A new sterilization procedure for women requires no
surgery. It's also irreversible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shari Roan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For couples who want permanent birth control, the sterilization
decision can be a difficult one. Vasectomy for him? Tubal ligation
for her? Now, the choice may be easier.</LD>
<LD>   A device approved last week by the Food and Drug Administration
creates a permanent obstruction in a woman's Fallopian tubes,
preventing pregnancy. The device, called Essure, requires no surgery
and significantly less recovery time than the traditional
sterilization method for women. And it may be just what a lot of men
are looking for too. Even though vasectomy is easier on a man than
tubal ligation is on a woman, many more women are sterilized.</LD>
<LD>   For La Tia Mayer and her husband, Essure was the perfect
compromise. Although the St. Louis couple had decided not to have a
child together, the newlyweds couldn't agree on how to accomplish
birth control.</LD>
<TE>   "My husband compared a vasectomy to being neutered," Mayer said.
"I had a problem with the idea of surgery. I just have a fear of
being knocked out and in pain."</TE>
<TE>   The stalemate was resolved, when Mayer discovered -- and
participated in -- a study of the new nonsurgical sterilization
device. It should be widely available in most urban areas by early
next year.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really easy. It was painless. It was just what I was
looking for," Mayer said.</TE>
<TE>   With the relative simplicity of Essure, some health experts
predict more women will undergo sterilization and that vasectomy
rates may drop. About 700,000 U.S. women undergo tubal ligation each
year. About 400,000 men have vasectomies.</TE>
<TE>   "The argument has always been that it's easier for the man [to
undergo sterilization] than it is for the woman," said Dr. Jay M.
Cooper, medical director of Women's Health Research in Phoenix and
the principal investigator in one of the Essure studies. "Essure is
leveling the playing field. Men who would have chosen vasectomy might
now want their spouses to consider Essure instead."</TE>
<TE>   Essure, however, is considered irreversible. While tubal ligation
and vasectomy are also permanent, reversals are sometimes possible.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with the Essure is that it is only for women who are
absolutely certain they don't want to have children again," said Dr.
Arnold Belker, a clinical professor of urology at the University of
Louisville School of Medicine. "Despite its simplicity, I'm not sure
how many women will opt for a method of sterilization that is not
reversible."</TE>
<TE>   Essure is a small, flexible implant that is inserted, using a
catheter and telescope, through the cervix and into each Fallopian
tube. Scar tissue forms over the device, creating a permanent
obstruction and preventing fertilization. The procedure takes no more
than 90 minutes, Cooper said, and most women return to work within a
day.</TE>
<TE>   In comparison, tubal ligation requires an abdominal incision,
general anesthetic, hours in a surgery center or hospital and about a
week of recovery time.</TE>
<TE>   Vasectomy involves one or two small cuts in the skin, the use of
local anesthetic and a day or two of recovery time. Vasectomy is as
effective as tubal ligation but is cheaper and less risky.</TE>
<TE>   For La Tia Mayer, not having to miss much work was the most
attractive aspect of Essure. "At 10:30 a.m., I was walking out the
office door," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The ease and effectiveness of Essure, however, will depend
somewhat on the doctor's skills. Under FDA guidelines, doctors must
be trained to insert Essure. The training will be coordinated by the
manufacturer, Conceptus Inc. of San Carlos, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   In one clinical trial, doctors failed in 14% of cases to place the
implants in both tubes. The FDA is requiring Conceptus to study the
placement failure rate with doctors newly trained in the procedure
and to identify the causes of failures.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, women should have an X-ray after three months to
confirm proper placement of the device and should use other birth
control until then. Essure is not recommended for women who have
tubal scarring or an abnormality of the uterus.</TE>
<TE>   So far, there are no pregnancies among almost 500 women using
Essure. Pregnancies occur in well under 1% of all tubal ligations and
vasectomies, and Essure is not expected to be perfect, either.</TE>
<TE>   "Tubal ligation has been here for 30 years. You can't compare it
to Essure because the follow-up on Essure is just beginning," said
Dr. Rafael Valle, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Northwestern
Memorial Hospital in Chicago who has studied the implant. "It will
take five to 10 years of follow-up to understand any side effects to
this method."</TE>
<TE>   Essure is expected to cost slightly less than tubal ligation,
which ranges from $1,000 to $2,500. Many insurers pay for
sterilization and are expected to cover Essure, according to
Conceptus officials.</TE>

<LD>Think of it as a personal trainer on your wrist. The benefit of a
heart-rate monitor, besides the simple satisfaction of knowing how
the old ticker's doing, is that it makes every workout count. It
helps you stay in "the zone," a heart-rate pace fast enough to
increase fitness, but slow enough to prevent burnout and injuries.
Basic monitors start at about $50. Spending more gets you zone

<HD>Heart study questions role of homocysteine</HD>
<DH>The relevance of high levels of the amino acid as a risk
predictor may be overstated, it says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the effort to predict vulnerability to heart disease and stroke,
doctors have looked at cholesterol levels, blood pressure, obesity
and, more recently, the amount of homocysteine in the blood.</LD>
<LD>   But the significance of elevated levels of this amino acid may
have been overstated -- at least in healthy people, according to a
review of more than 30 studies involving 5,000 people.</LD>
<LD>   In the review, published in the Oct. 23/30 issue of the Journal of
the American Medical Assn., a group of scientists led by Dr. Robert
Clarke of the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, England, found elevated
homocysteine levels to be at best only a modest predictor of a
person's risk for stroke and heart disease. The authors said that
large studies of whether folic acid supplements can lower cardiac
disease risk will provide more information about the relevance of
high homocysteine.</LD>
<TE>   When proteins are digested, the body produces homocysteine. A lot
of homocysteine is believed to damage cells in the walls of blood
vessels, thus contributing to the formation of the artery-clogging
plaques linked to strokes and heart attacks. Folic acid, also known
as folate, is a B vitamin that helps break down homocysteine in the
body.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, homocysteine may be a more meaningful risk factor
in patients with a genetic mutation that lowers folate levels and
raises homocysteine levels, according to a Dutch review of 40 studies
involving nearly 24,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   That review, in the same issue of the journal, found that patients
with the mutation were at increased risk of coronary heart disease.
The authors suggested that increasing folate in the diet, which has
occurred in the U.S. with the fortification of flour and other foods,
could decrease risk.</TE>

<HD>Potential AIDS preventive doubles as a contraceptive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Marsa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Our best weapon against the spread of AIDS may turn out to be a
common gel that's been used for years in drugs and cosmetics. That's
the hope of a Johns Hopkins University research team, which has
devised a microbicide that not only prevents sexually transmitted
diseases such as AIDS but acts as a contraceptive too.</LD>
<LD>   Since an AIDS vaccine has proved elusive, public health officials
have stepped up development of microbe-killing chemicals. A
Rockefeller Foundation study released earlier this year estimated
that the introduction of an effective product could avert 2.5 million
infections in regions like Africa in the first three years.</LD>
<LD>   The Johns Hopkins microbicide, called BufferGel, is a leading
contender.</LD>
<TE>   The odorless ointment's protective mechanism is based on an
elegantly simple bit of high school chemistry: Alkaline compounds
neutralize acid -- and other chemicals can reverse that process.</TE>
<TE>   The vaginal area is mildly acidic, with a pH level of 4 (neutral
is 7), comparable to the acidity of wine. "That degree of acidity
kills sperm, and all sorts of germs," says Richard Cone, a
biophysicist at Johns Hopkins who helped develop the product.</TE>
<TE>   Semen, which is alkaline with a pH between 7 and 8, raises the
vaginal pH to 7 for hours. This allows sperm to survive long enough
to fertilize an egg and enables germs to infect cells. Based on this,
researchers devised a strategy that mimics the vagina's method of
safeguarding against foreign intruders.</TE>
<TE>   They found that a common pharmaceutical compound, which had been
used for decades to thicken ointments, was able to preserve vaginal
acidity even in the presence of sperm. So they made it into a
lubricant gel. "We wanted to use something that had a long track
record of safety with no side effects," says Dr. Thomas Moench, who
also helped develop BufferGel.</TE>
<TE>   This latter point is especially significant because of recent
disappointment about the once highly touted microbicide nonoxynol-9,
approved by the FDA as a contraceptive. A 2000 study revealed that
the spermicide promoted, rather than prevented, HIV transmission
because it irritated the cells lining the vagina, providing viruses
with an entry point through the damaged tissue.</TE>
<TE>   Initial lab tests, conducted in the early '90s, indicated
BufferGel preserved the acidity of the vagina, thus killing off such
sexually transmitted microbes as HIV, norrhea, chlamydia, herpes,
syphilis, HPV (human papilloma virus, which causes genital warts and
cervical cancer), and trichomaniases, the most common STD. Safety
studies on 125 women in the U.S. and abroad were recently completed.
A contraceptive trial by the National Institutes of Health is
underway in which 975 women who are using a diaphragm in combination
with either BufferGel or a conventional spermicide. If all goes well,
BufferGel could be on sale in the U.S. within two years.</TE>
<TE>   But the more crucial test, say researchers, will begin in spring,
when 8,500 women in the U.S., India and Africa will see if BufferGel
can thwart the spread of AIDS. If it's effective, it will provide an
alternative to women whose partners refuse to use condoms. "This puts
the control back into a woman's hands," says Johns Hopkins' Cone.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disease fighters</TE>
<TE>   Although more than 50 microbicides are under development, only a
few, including BufferGel, are nearing tests in the large-scale
clinical trials needed for FDA approval.</TE>
<TE>   Another promising candidate is Carruguard, which was developed by
the nonprofit Population Council; it's slated for tests in Africa
early next year. Carruguard, which is composed of a seaweed-derived
gel that is used as an additive in cosmetics and toothpaste, seems to
attach itself to the outer coat of the AIDS virus, making it
inactive.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Pro2000, a contraceptive gel made by the Lexington,
Mass.-based Indevus Pharmaceuticals, interferes with HIV's ability to
enter uninfected cells. Pro2000 is scheduled for tests alongside
BufferGel in spring.</TE>

<LD>Marked crosswalks with no traffic signals or stop signs may give
elderly pedestrians a false sense of security -- especially when
compared with other types of intersections.</LD>
<LD>   True, motorists are supposed to stop when a person steps into a
crosswalk, but the reality is many don't. A study of 282 crosswalk
injuries in six cities -- in Long Beach and West Los Angeles and four
cities in Washington -- found that elderly people were three times as
likely to be hit by a vehicle when crossing a street in a marked
crosswalk (but with no signal or sign) than if that same intersection
had an unmarked crosswalk.</LD>
<LD>   There was almost no difference in the risk of injury between
marked and unmarked crosswalks as long as some type of traffic
control was present.</LD>
<TE>   "I was struck by how difficult it is to cross the street when
you're an older person. Some research has shown that they need more
time to cross, then they hesitate before they cross, which gives them
even less time," says Dr. Thomas B. Cole, co-author of the editorial
accompanying the study and associate professor of social medicine and
epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
"Instead of getting rid of crosswalks, we need to make them safer."</TE>

<HD>The peril of treating osteoporosis as only a woman's
disease</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Timothy Gower</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a familiar complaint: Men receive better medical care than
women. Research has shown, for instance, that male heart attack
victims are given more aggressive therapy than female heart patients.
The problem has been blamed on bias -- doctors tend to think of heart
attacks as a predominantly male problem. But a new study suggests
that men may also be undertreated for conditions associated primarily
with women.</LD>
<LD>   About 10 million Americans have osteoporosis, the disease that
causes bones to become brittle and weak, and about 20% of all
sufferers are male, according to the National Osteoporosis
Foundation. However, a report published last month in the Archives of
Internal Medicine found that many American men with osteoporosis
aren't receiving the care they need.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston followed 363
patients who had suffered hip fractures. Roughly one-third were male,
and the average age of the patients was about 80. Most of the men and
women broke their hips in falls, suggesting that their bones were
quite fragile. Given their age and the nature of their injuries, most
experts would agree that these patients should have been considered
prime candidates for a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Yet, upon being
discharged from the hospital, only five out of 110 male patients --
4.5% -- were being treated for osteoporosis, contrasted with 27% of
the women.</LD>
<TE>   The Houston researchers, led by bone physiologist Gary Kiebzak,
periodically checked up on the patients for five years. The
percentage of men who were put on some form of bone-health regimen
(usually vitamin supplements) eventually rose to 27%. But the
comparable figure for women was much higher -- 71%. Women also were
twice as likely as the men to receive more aggressive treatment, such
as prescription drugs for osteoporosis and bone-density tests.</TE>
<TE>   Although women have a greater risk of developing osteoporosis, men
are more likely to die of complications related to a serious
fracture, such as blood clots. In the Houston study, 32% of the male
patients died within a year of being discharged compared to 17% of
the women.</TE>
<TE>   Why did the men get such spotty care? Kiebzak believes it's
because male osteoporosis "isn't on everybody's radar screen." While
orthopedists fix more severe broken bones, long-term treatment of
patients who suffer fractures is more likely to be handled by
primary-care doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Kiebzak can only speculate about why the male patients he studied
were so unlikely to be diagnosed with osteoporosis, but he suspects
it's because many primary-care physicians still associate weak bones
with women. That's a view reinforced by news stories about
osteoporosis and product advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Eric Orwoll of the Oregon Health &amp; Science University points
out that doctors lack uniform guidelines for diagnosing and treating
osteoporosis in men. A recent development may help. The gold standard
for diagnosing osteoporosis is a special form of X-ray that measures
bone density.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the International Society for Clinical Densitometry
established new guidelines to help physicians decide when male
patients should undergo bone-density testing. Men who have broken
bones from low-impact forces, such as falling down (so-called
"fragility fractures"), should be tested, according to the society's
new guidelines. So should men with increased risk factors for bone
deterioration. That includes low testosterone levels, use of
corticosteroid medications (such as prednisone), cigarette smoking
and alcohol abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The society also recommends bone-density testing for all men over
age 70, though Orwoll says there's little data to suggest such a
sweeping measure would be cost-effective.</TE>

<HD>Heavy periods' economic toll</HD>
<DH>The 10% to 15% of reproductive-age women with severe
bleeding lose $1,700 in yearly pay, a study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Heavy menstrual periods are more than an inconvenience. They exact a
significant economic toll. American women who suffer severe bleeding
and cramping miss nearly a month of work and lose work time valued at
nearly $1,700, on average, each year, researchers report in the first
attempt to quantify the financial impact.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. David Cumming, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the
University of Alberta in Canada, analyzed data from nearly 2,800 U.S.
participants in a large federal health survey in 1999. All had at
least one menstrual period in the previous year, none were taking
estrogen and none had been diagnosed with reproductive cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Those with heavy monthly flows, who constitute an estimated 10% to
15% of reproductive-age women, were less likely to have worked in the
previous week than women who reported light or normal monthly
bleeding, Cumming reported. They tended to be younger, less educated
and single, and were less likely to be white than women with more
normal periods.</LD>
<TE>   The study authors based their economic loss estimates on the $470
per week that the average U.S. working woman earned in 2000. The
report was published in the October issue of Obstetrics and
Gynecology.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Cumming said that when he and his colleagues
studied direct economic costs of hysterectomies and other procedures
associated with heavy bleeding, they "were unable to come up with a
figure about how these things were affecting the patients
financially."</TE>
<TE>   So they undertook the latest study and were surprised by the
financial ramifications. In a rough calculation, Cumming said, the
$1,692 in economic losses, , multiplied by the number of working
women thought to suffer with heavy bleeding, adds up to $15 billion.
And that's probably a low estimate, because the problem is
underreported.</TE>
<TE>   "Patients I see may talk to their husbands, but certainly it's not
something they're going to discuss at work with people that control
time off. It's only when they get to the stage where they need
surgery or some diagnostic testing that they talk about it," Cumming
said.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers also found fewer women with heavy bleeding tended
to rate their overall health as excellent or very good: 55% compared
with 70% of women with light or normal flow.</TE>
<TE>   Cumming said heavy periods, called menorrhagia, are among the most
common reasons women go to the doctor. The bleeding often is due to
uterine fibroids, hormonal imbalances, polyps, pelvic inflammatory
disease or endometrial cancer.</TE>

<HD>Counting on 10,000 steps to add up to better health</HD>
<DH>A regimen of walking could put the body throough its paces.
But that number need not be everyone's goal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every journey may begin with a single step, but when it comes to
fitness, does it end at 10,000? That's the question people are asking
about the 10,000-steps-a-day walking program, a fitness regimen that
is gaining momentum in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The basic theory is that walking 10,000 steps a day can improve
one's health and fitness level. Adding more steps -- say 2,000 to
5,000 -- may also help shed pounds. But those numbers, say health
professionals, are a guide, and the amount of walking should be based
on one's fitness level and goals.</LD>
<LD>   Either counting steps or wearing an inexpensive pedometer clipped
to the waist is all that's needed to track one's progress, and walks
can be broken up throughout the day, making this a relatively easy,
gym-less way to get fit. As obesity levels in the United States
escalate and health professionals continue to look for ways to get
people moving, walking continues to rank high as a painless,
sustainable program. And walking 10,000 steps is roughly equivalent
to the 30 minutes of daily exercise, the recommended minimum.</LD>
<TE>   The regimen, which began in Japan some 40 years ago, is still
popular there--and its benefits were reinforced in 1993 by a Japanese
researcher who found that people who walked an average of 10,000
steps a day were healthier than those who didn't. In the last few
years, the program has moved across the Pacific to a welcoming
public.</TE>
<TE>   By counting steps, "Everyone can play and everyone can win," says
Helen Thompson, program and research liaison at the Center for Human
Nutrition at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. "If I
tell someone who averages 3,000 steps a day to go up to 10,000,
they'll give up right away. But if I tell them to increase it by
2,000 steps, they say, 'Yes, I can do that.' An additional 2,000
steps can be done in two 10-minute breaks. It burns an extra 75 to
100 calories, and that can prevent 1 to 3 pounds of weight that most
Americans put on a year.</TE>
<TE>   Tracking steps daily, says Ruth Ann Carpenter, associate director
of the research division at the Cooper Institute in Dallas, "removes
many of the roadblocks people have about exercising. It's a little
reminder that instead of driving to the store, you can walk. It
drives home the point that you can make your entire day more active,
as opposed to going to the gym and then being sedentary 23.5 hours
out of the day."</TE>
<TE>   Before going for that 10,000-steps-a-day goal, health
professionals recommend counting steps every day for a week, then
averaging them at the end of the week. Opinions vary on how much and
how fast to increase steps -- anywhere from 200 to 2,000 a week can
be added -- but most recommend a gradual, week-to-week increase to
get used to the added distance and not feel overwhelmed.</TE>
<TE>   How to add those steps is another matter, especially in
car-dependent cities such as Los Angeles. Choosing a more distant
parking space, taking the stairs, using a bathroom on another floor,
walking over to a colleague instead of using e-mail and walking the
dog are some ways. Even returning grocery carts to the front of the
store and pacing while talking on the phone can add steps.</TE>
<TE>   But setting a daily goal, whether it's 8,000 steps or 12,000
steps, should be left up to the individual, says Catrine Tudor-Locke,
assistant professor of health promotion in the department of exercise
and wellness at Arizona State University.</TE>
<TE>   "That 10,000 figure is probably reasonable for average younger and
healthy adults 20 to 40," she says. "We did a cross-sectional study
and found that people who took less than 5,000 steps a day were more
likely to be obese, and people who took more than 9,000 steps a day
were more likely to be normal weight. But there are obese people who
walk 12,000 steps a day and normal-weight people who take 4,000 steps
a day. And if someone is already taking 12,000 steps a day and wants
to lose weight, the last thing you're going to tell them is take
10,000 steps a day."</TE>
<TE>   Goals should be individualized, she says: "Basically we tell
people to find where you are at the beginning, then increase by an
amount that is going to be an improvement, and be sustainable. If
someone wants to lose weight and they're increasing their steps by a
substantial amount but the scale doesn't budge, look at another
behavior, like eating."</TE>
<TE>   "I think 10,000 steps is a great goal," says Mark Fenton, physical
activity program manager at University of North Carolina's Pedestrian
and Bicycle Information Center and author of "The Complete Guide to
Walking for Health, Weight Loss, and Fitness" (Lyons Press, 2001).
"For a person starting at 2,000 steps it may take them 10 or 12 weeks
to get there, but that's a good, gradual increase. Most people have
little sense of how far 10,000 steps is.... Some people think it's a
mile, some people think it's 10 miles."</TE>
<TE>   Tudor-Locke considers 10,000 steps to be roughly five miles,
taking into account differences in strides. But how much ground
10,000 steps will cover depends on the individual. A mile is 5,280
feet long, and if your stride is just a foot long, you can walk
10,000 steps in less than two miles.</TE>
<TE>   Not every step has to be a power step; most experts say one's
regular pace is fine. Thompson suggests striving for a higher
intensity for more calorie burning, and Fenton says quicker strides
can also help build cardiovascular fitness.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," says Carpenter, "if we could only get the equivalent of a
pedometer for our diets."</TE>

<HD>The sugar habit</HD>
<DH>Just a sweet tooth or a real addiction? Once skeptical,
scientists take a closer look at the notion that people can get
hooked on sugar as if it were a drug.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shari Roan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her darkest days, Elena Santaballa painstakingly planned her
binges. She surreptitiously purchased her stash. She hid the
evidence. Even when trying to resist the temptation to use, she
almost always succumbed.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, three years ago, the Culver City woman acknowledged that
she was hooked on sugar.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like being an alcoholic," says the 37-year-old entertainment
executive, who was extremely overweight when she joined a 12-step
treatment program. "There is always the danger I'll go back to it if
I don't have some sort of support program. I still struggle with
wanting to use sugar as a drug."</LD>
<TE>   The concept of sugar addiction has been popularized in books --
and joked about -- for decades. But most health experts have long
maintained that overuse of sugar doesn't meet the criteria of
addiction, typically described as an intense desire for a substance
(so that it disrupts normal life), great difficulty stopping use of
the substance and a severe physiological response upon withdrawal.
People who are addicted, they add, lose control over their behavior
and use a substance compulsively and repetitively in spite of adverse
consequences related to their actions.</TE>
<TE>   Now researchers are finding what many sufferers have long
suspected -- the compulsive overeating of sugar does at least share
some of the characteristics of more destructive addictions. Their
work is shedding light on the neurological response of those who
abuse sugar.</TE>
<TE>   In a widely discussed study presented earlier this month, for
example, Princeton University psychologist Bartley Hoebel showed that
rats will not only eat sugar excessively, they suffer from withdrawal
when denied sugar and continue to crave it weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Addiction 'plausible'</TE>
<TE>   Most of the studies so far have been in animals. But researchers
at Columbia University will soon launch a study focusing on sugar
dependency in bulimics -- people who binge (usually on rich, sweet
food) and then purge.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who have pathological, clinical eating disorders
who say they are addicted to chocolate and other sweets. And you know
what? They may be," says research nutritionist Adam Drewnowski,
director of the Center for Public Health Nutrition at the University
of Washington. "I think it's plausible."</TE>
<TE>   So does Kathleen DesMaisons. Many of the people she counsels fit
at least some of that description. DesMaisons, who calls herself a
"recovering sugar addict," is a leading proponent of the theory of
sugar addiction and the author of "The Sugar Addict's Total Recovery
Program." DesMaisons was managing a treatment center for alcoholics
when she began to see similarities between alcoholism and compulsive
overeating.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're addicted to sugar, you need more to feel better,"
says DesMaisons, who runs a Web site on sugar addiction from her home
in Albuquerque. "Your life starts being focused on getting a sugar
fix. You have symptoms of withdrawal, which is craving. You get
antsy, irritable and cranky. To dismiss the experience of thousands
and thousands of people who say they feel this way is pretty silly."</TE>
<TE>   The average American adult consumes about 158 pounds of refined
sugar a year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a
figure that has increased 25% in the last three decades as the
popularity of high-sugar-content convenience foods grew. Most people
simply like sweets. But for others, the desire for sugar becomes
extreme, similar to those hooked on cocaine, alcohol or other
chemicals, says DesMaisons.</TE>
<TE>   "They lie about how much they use," she says. "They hide evidence,
like candy wrappers. They'll go out at 11 p.m. to buy a pint of ice
cream."</TE>
<TE>   And they flunk the chocolate-chip cookie test. While many people
would eat -- and savor -- a few freshly baked cookies, sugar junkies
would embarrass themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine a plate of cookies just out of the oven. People who are
addicts start laughing at the thought of that. They would eat the
whole plate," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Terri Walker says her feelings of worthlessness and depression
made her realize she had a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say 'I'm not going to eat it,' and the next thing I knew
I would talk myself out of it," says Walker, 35, a warehouse clerk in
Barstow who was about 20 pounds overweight and, she says, suffered
from fatigue, low energy and poor self-esteem. "Then I would kick
myself because I had no willpower. I had feelings of shame and
failure. A lot of the addictive behaviors that people would attribute
to other types of addiction: hiding things, hoarding, being overly
upset when someone ate your goods-- I've done all that."</TE>
<TE>   People who call themselves sugar addicts also say the recovery
process mirrors drug and alcohol addiction.</TE>
<TE>   "When I eliminated sugar from my diet, I went through a
detoxification," says Santaballa, who gave up eating all refined
sugar. "I had flu-like symptoms, the shakes, headaches, and I was
exhausted for 30 days. Sometime within the first 10 days I became
craving-free. I still had the behavior of wanting it, but the
physiological craving went away."</TE>
<TE>   Nutritionists typically dismiss the notion of sugar cravings
because the body metabolizes sugar the same way it does all
carbohydrates, whether they are from doughnuts or bread or fruit or
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   "The form of carbohydrate that is eaten doesn't matter because the
body breaks everything down into [sugar] anyway," says Richard
Surwit, chief of medical psychology at Duke University Medical
Center. "The brain cannot burn anything but sugar. That's the only
thing it uses for metabolism. So saying the brain is addicted to
sugar is like saying a gasoline engine is addicted to gasoline."</TE>
<TE>   But evidence also suggests that sugar can negatively alter brain
chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drug-like action on brain</TE>
<TE>   Studies by Drewnowski in the 1980s offered some evidence that the
brain's response to sugar cravings is similar to that provoked by
heroin or cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Addictive drugs stimulate receptors in the brain to release
natural opiods and dopamine, neurochemicals that trigger feelings of
pleasure or well-being. In Drewnowski's experiment, when chocolate
lovers were given a drug, naloxone, that blocks the opiod receptors,
they no longer craved chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   "A strong preference for fats and sweets may reward opiod
mechanisms in the brain. But we can't say that this happens to
everyone," he says, noting that the preference is much more common in
women than men.</TE>
<TE>   He also points out that intense sugar cravings are actually
yearnings for sugar and fat. "Sweet treats are rarely just sugar,"
says Drewnowski, one of the nation's leading authorities on taste
preferences. "They are usually a mixture of sugar and fat -- ice
cream, cake, doughnuts. Watermelon is [full of sugar], but no one
craves that. However, when you bring sugar and fat together, there is
this kind of synergy."</TE>
<TE>   What the body appears to crave is the combination of high-energy
foods that also pack some hefty calories, he says. This fix of sugar
and fat often produces the well-known "sugar high."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hoebel's research found that rats, when denied food for
12 hours, binged on a sugar solution when presented with a choice of
regular rat chow or sugar water. The rats gradually drank more sugar
water and ate less chow and showed signs of withdrawal when the diet
was stopped -- such as teeth chattering and being more fearful while
navigating an elevated maze.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing use of a substance and withdrawal symptoms are two
characteristics of a dependency. But, says Hoebel, "to really call
something addictive, you need to show there is a heightened
motivation, or craving."</TE>
<TE>   In a study presented earlier this month at the Society for
Neuroscience meeting in Orlando, Fla., Hoebel demonstrated that three
weeks after resuming a regular diet of rat chow, the rats frequently
pressed a bar that had been used to release the sugar solution.
Although denied more sugar water, the rats' behavior indicates an
"exaggerated" motivation for the substance, Hoebel says.</TE>
<TE>   "This is evidence that there are changes in the brain that last,"
he says. The rats' behavior "is beginning to meet the full definition
of addiction."</TE>
<TE>   Others downplay the animal research, saying that humans don't show
withdrawal symptoms. In his research, Surwit put one group of people
on a sugar-free diet and another on a low-fat diet that contained 50%
of calories from sugar. After six weeks on the diet, both groups lost
the same amount of weight and the dieters eating lots of sugar showed
no behavior changes while on the diet and no ill effects after
stopping it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Emotional factors cited</TE>
<TE>   Still, no one knows why certain people dramatically overeat sugary
foods. Genetic predisposition, learned behavior and, perhaps,
underlying emotional issues are likely factors, experts say. Based on
the rat study, Hoebel suggests that a destructive sugar habit may be
established by a pattern of sugar deprivation followed by bingeing --
a practice common among bulimics.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, some people can crave sugar, eat a cookie and be
satisfied while others continually flunk the chocolate-chip cookie
test, says Drewnowski. Intense emotional feelings may override a
resolve to resist sweets.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone sits down alone and eats two pints of vanilla ice
cream and is not able to stop, that is a problem," he says. "Your
body is trying to tell you something -- probably that you're too
stressed or depressed."</TE>
<TE>   Research is a long way from helping people who compulsively crave
sugar. A medication is available to block opiods. But, says
Drewnowski, "It's used to prevent alcoholic binges. No one is going
to use it to prevent bingeing on ice cream."</TE>
<TE>   He advocates cutting sugar consumption and avoiding refined sugar,
as well as counseling for underlying emotional issues that might
trigger binges. Many of the popular books on sugar addiction, such as
DesMaisons,' promote abstinence from foods containing refined sugar.</TE>
<TE>   "The proof is in the pudding -- the pun is intended," says
Santaballa, who has lost 100 pounds after several years on a
no-refined-sugar diet.</TE>
<TE>   "When I accidentally ingest sugar, I am crawling out of my skin.
My body knows it's there. There's nothing you can do to convince me
this is not an addiction."</TE>

<LD>Shark cartilage is just what it sounds like: cartilage from sharks.
The cartilage, which is ground up and stuffed into capsules or
pressed into tablets, is composed of collagen, water, phosphate,
calcium and chondroitin sulfate. It may not sound like a magic
elixir, but some extravagant claims about the power of shark
cartilage have been made over the last decade.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Uses: Typically used to ease the discomfort associated with
arthritis, shark cartilage also is thought to inhibit the growth of
new blood vessels, leading to its possible ability to limit the
growth of cancerous tumors -- or even cure cancer.</LD>
<TE>   Dose: Recommendations vary widely, from 500 milligrams to 5,000
milligrams, one to six times a day.</TE>
<TE>   Precautions: It's probably not dangerous, although high doses can
cause a bad taste in the mouth, nausea, constipation, low blood
pressure and fatigue. There are no known interactions with drugs or
food.</TE>
<TE>   Research: Most studies have been done in the lab or on animals,
not on humans, but some show shark cartilage may have
anti-inflammatory effects. Also, the federal government has launched
a large randomized, controlled trial to study whether shark cartilage
improves the survival of people with advanced colorectal or breast
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplements makers are not required by the U.S. government
to demonstrate that their products are safe or effective. Ask your
health-care provider for advice on selecting a brand.</TE>

<HD>Genes have a big say on fatty foods</HD>
<DH>It's likelier that heredity, and not a hamburger,
determines how healthy the heart stays. But there's still reason to
watch what you eat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Ursell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cutting back on saturated fats -- found in red meat and dairy
products -- may not reduce our risk of heart attacks as much as we
thought. It may be our genes that determine whether the fat in
hamburgers, cheese and ice cream are actually bad for our hearts.</LD>
<LD>   Research published in the Oct. 21 issue of Circulation: Journal of
the American Heart Assn. reveals that, in people with a normal form
of the hepatic lipase gene, levels of protective HDL cholesterol
increase slightly when eating a diet laden with saturated fat. (HDL,
or high-density lipoprotein, reduces the risk of heart attack by
carrying fatty deposits away from arterial walls.)</LD>
<LD>   Those with a mutation on the hepatic lipase gene aren't so
fortunate.</LD>
<TE>   In them, the study showed, a diet high in saturated fats
dramatically lowers the level of HDL in the blood, leaving them
exposed to a higher risk of heart attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The findings help explain why some people can eat "whatever they
like" and experience no ill effects on their cholesterol levels,
while others believe they have only to look at a bowl of ice cream to
have problems with cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   The research also sheds light on why some people respond
positively to reductions in saturated fat while others do not.</TE>
<TE>   The study's authors say that it is too soon to recommend
widespread genetic testing to determine our hepatic lipase gene
status.</TE>
<TE>   When it does become possible, however, doctors will be able to
offer individually tailored nutritional advice that could
dramatically reduce the risk of heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, the American Heart Assn.'s recommendation that we all
cut back on saturated fats remains sound advice. Because, although it
may not improve everyone's level of good cholesterol, a new
Australian study shows it may have another heart-friendly benefit --
helping us acquire a trim waist.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists at Curtin University of Technology in Perth, Australia,
have found that eating more monounsaturated fats -- found in olive
oil, nuts and seeds -- may help us gradually slim down.</TE>
<TE>   Their discovery came from a study in which they fed a group of men
two different breakfasts on two separate days. While both breakfasts
supplied the same amount of calories and total grams of fat, the fat
came from monounsaturated olive oil on one day and saturated fat-rich
cream on the other.</TE>
<TE>   For up to five hours after the olive oil-rich breakfast, the
researchers discovered, the men burned fat in their bodies
significantly faster than after the cream-rich breakfast. The
difference in fat-burning rates was large enough for researchers to
conclude that a simple switch from a diet rich in saturated fat to
one higher in monounsaturated fat may have beneficial effects in
curbing weight gain.</TE>
<TE>   In practice this would mean, for example, giving up mayonnaise in
favor of olive oil, having extra lean steak (rather surprisingly, 50%
of its fat is monounsaturated) instead of burgers, and munching nuts
and seeds as snacks in place of crisps, tortilla chips and cookies.</TE>

<HD>Tenet Under Closer Exam</HD>
<DH>Pricing policy may have resulted in excessive Medicaid
payments, some analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even before Tenet Healthcare Corp. disclosed last week that it was
facing a federal audit of Medicare billing practices, Clark Dresser
suspected that something was going on with Tenet's hospital prices.</LD>
<LD>   In August, the 80-year-old Dresser checked into Tenet's Centinela
Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood for an angioplasty, to open up a
clogged artery. Dresser had the procedure at 3 p.m., and with no
complications, went home at 9:30 the next morning.</LD>
<LD>   But when Dresser, who used to price medical supplies for a living,
got an itemized bill, he was stunned: The charges exceeded $50,000. A
single coronary stent, a small tube inserted in a heart valve or
artery, was listed at $12,000 -- about 10 times the actual cost to
hospitals. Among other charges: $21 for one aspirin.</LD>
<TE>   "The markup is too much," Dresser complained.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet officials said they won't comment about a patient's bill but
suggested there was little harm done. Dresser, after all, didn't have
to pay for all of that, just an $810 deductible because he's covered
by Medicare. And Medicare pays the hospital a fixed rate that is
typically only a fraction of its sticker prices. So do private
insurers, which negotiate big discounts from hospital list prices.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the fact that Tenet has been aggressively pushing up
retail hospital charges -- which the company acknowledged last week
-- does matter for patients, hospitals and the health-care industry.
Wall Street analysts say they think Tenet deliberately raised its
list prices to maximize special payments it receives from Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   And now some of them are questioning whether Tenet's pricing
policy allowed it to collect excessive amounts of certain payments
from another government program: Medicaid, the state- and federally
funded insurance for the poor and disabled. Those Medicaid funds,
known as DSH payments, are based on a formula that includes a
hospital's uncollected debts and charity care, which are influenced
by retail charges.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet denies that it intentionally hiked prices to game Medicare
or the DSH program.</TE>
<TE>   Others say that one group of patients who may be most affected by
Tenet's price increases is those without insurance. "They are as
aggressive in collections as they are in pricing," said K.B. Forbes,
who has been helping a group of uninsured patients sue Tenet for
allegedly refusing to offer them discounts from retail charges.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson says the firm's hospitals rarely
collect money from the uninsured, and when they do those patients
typically pay only a small portion of the list price.</TE>
<TE>   As for DSH, he said, Tenet's payments have changed little in the
last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Steep hospital charges have been an issue not only at the 40 Tenet
hospitals in California; rapid hospital inflation nationally has been
a big driver in soaring health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, federal regulators have begun to review whether past
hospital mergers and consolidation may have led to monopoly pricing.</TE>
<TE>   But by its own admission and public filings, Tenet pushed the
envelope further than most. In the last year alone, company insiders
say, Tenet hospitals raised their prices twice.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Tenet officials huddled over the weekend in Santa Barbara,
where the company is based, to begin a thorough review of financial
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said Sunday that it probably would take two to three
weeks "to determine how a situation of this magnitude was not
properly vetted in the organization, and to figure out exactly what
the pricing situation was at every hospital."</TE>
<TE>   The focus of the federal audit of Tenet is Medicare funds known as
"outlier payments." These payments, so named because they refer to
cases that lie outside the norm, are made in addition to fixed
Medicare reimbursements to help hospitals defray expenses for
unusually costly treatments, such as cardiac procedures. The method
for calculating outliers is complex. But the higher the retail
charges, the more cases that will qualify for these payments.</TE>
<TE>   For example, suppose a Medicare patient has a coronary procedure
and the hospital files a claim with Medicare for $100,000 in retail
charges. Medicare will pay the hospital a fixed rate for that
procedure, regardless of how many days the patient stayed in the
hospital. If Medicare pays $20,000 for that procedure, the hospital
will have $80,000 of unpaid charges.</TE>
<TE>   That's where outliers come in. That $80,000 is then multiplied by
a ratio, and if that resulting amount exceeds a pre-set threshold --
in 2002 it was $21,025 -- the hospital would receive additional
payments. So, if the hospital raised its retail charge for the
coronary procedure to $120,000, and the Medicare reimbursement
remained the same at $20,000, the hospital could calculate its
outlier payments based on the higher $100,000 unpaid charge. Thus,
the greater the increase in retail charges, the greater the outlier
payments.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet said last week that although it did not break Medicare
rules, it did receive a growing and unusually large share of outlier
payments -- $763 million in the last year. Of that amount, more than
half came from 11 of its 113 hospitals. Among those 11 are seven in
California, including Centinela and Redding Medical Center, now at
the center of a separate federal probe of two doctors who allegedly
performed unnecessary heart procedures.</TE>
<TE>   All seven of these California hospitals, which also include Desert
Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs and Garfield Medical Center
in Monterey Park, are highly profitable and have been driving
significant earnings to the corporation. And sharp price increases
were a core factor in that.</TE>
<TE>   Although hospitals closely guard the retail rates for procedures
and supplies, public records show how rapidly prices have been rising
at some Tenet hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   At the 384-bed Centinela hospital, for example, the retail charge
per patient per day totaled $12,186 in the second quarter of this
year. That was up 72% from the same quarter two years earlier,
according to company filings with California's Office of Statewide
Health and Planning Department.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, for all 400-plus California hospitals, the average
retail charge per patient per day rose 33% in that same two-year
period, to $5,389 -- less than half the retail charge at Centinela.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, the Tenet spokesman, said that some of the patient
revenue increases at Centinela reflect the introduction of
specialized procedures, such as cardiology. He said Tenet did not
know how much Medicare outlier payments contributed to Centinela's
profit, but it is probably substantial.</TE>
<TE>   Centinela's operating margin -- or the percent of revenue that is
kept as income after expenses -- was 34% in the second quarter. That
was 10 times the average for 436 for-profit and nonprofit California
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said each hospital sets its own prices based on the
market. "There was guidance from Tom Mackey that hospitals should be
aggressive," Anderson said. Mackey, Tenet's former chief operating
officer, left the company last week, as did David Dennis, chief
financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said Jeff Barbakow, Tenet's chairman and chief executive,
asked both men to leave because they had not kept him informed about
hospital pricing strategy and the effect that had on boosting
Medicare outlier payments to an unacceptable level. Barbakow said the
company will back away from such aggressive price increases, which
analysts say will weaken Tenet's hand in negotiating rates with
insurers.</TE>
<TE>   Retail hospital charges are used as a starting point for
negotiations, and health insurance companies have noticed the rapid
run-up in prices.</TE>
<TE>   A sudden price hike matters because insurers, which pay a flat
daily rate for hospital procedures, pay a percent of retail charges
when they exceed a threshold -- just as with Medicare outliers.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Rosefsky, 66, who lives in the Palm Springs area, said he was
"flabbergasted" when he inadvertently got a copy of his hospital
bill. Rosefsky had gone to Tenet's Desert Regional Medical Center for
radiation therapy after a high reading on a prostate cancer test. He
spent no more than four hours at the hospital, he said.</TE>
<TE>   His retail charges came to $57,833. About $23,000 was for
medicine, which, Rosefsky's physician told him, was five times what
it actually cost the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Then there were smaller charges: $250 for one drape sheet, $15 for
a disposable glove.</TE>
<TE>   "It just offends me to know something like this is going on,"
Rosefsky said. Even if Medicare isn't paying full price, why is the
hospital charging such rates? he asked. "I'm upset they're
excessively billing, hoping to get more than they're entitled to."</TE>

<HD>Brazil Steel Firms Defy Doomsday Outlook</HD>
<DH>Devalued currency and shortage in U.S. have spurred exports
despite tariffs and quotas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Kraul</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO</DL>
<LD>Call it the Brazilian steel industry's dirty little secret: Exports
to the United States are booming, despite the surcharges and quotas
President Bush imposed earlier this year that were designed to limit
their flow.</LD>
<LD>   Manufacturers and government officials here complained bitterly
when U.S. tariffs of as much as 30% were imposed on imports in March.
They accused the United States of unfair tactics on the global
playing field and warned that U.S. protectionism threatened Brazil's
tenuous economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   But instead of shrinking, Brazil's steel exports to the U.S. so
far this year are running 45% ahead of last year and are on track to
shatter the full-year record set in 1999 of 3.37 million tons, a
flood that prodded Bush and Congress to impose the trade barriers.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, the U.S. imported 8% more steel from across the globe in
the first nine months of 2002 than it did during the same period a
year ago -- before the tariffs went into effect.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of Brazilian steel exports are semi-finished slabs and
not the higher-value finished products such as hot- and cold-rolled
steel that are the most profitable and are largely kept off the U.S.
market by tariffs and U.S. anti-dumping claims. The slabs are coming
in at such a volume because U.S. factories cannot satisfy domestic
demand.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the export boom has been good for Brazil's two largest
steel companies, Gerdau Group of Porto Alegre and Companhia
Siderugica Nacionale (CSN) of Rio. Each has made investments in U.S.
steel plants in recent years, in part as a defensive move to counter
U.S. protectionism. And each has reported that exports have doubled
so far this year over 2001. Their biggest market: the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Gerdau, the hemisphere's biggest manufacturer of "long" steel
products, including I-beams and corners used in heavy construction,
has bought three steel plants in North America since 1995 and in
August merged them all into one entity called Gerdau Ameristeel
Corp., based in Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to own steel capacity in the United States, to
diversify in different areas of the world with different products,"
said the steel giant's chief executive, Jorge Gerdau Johannpeter. He
declined to talk about the issue of U.S. tariffs.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's exports are fueling job growth in the mills and are
helping to widen the country's total trade surplus, which is expected
to reach a record $10 billion this year, a welcome bright spot in a
clouded economy.</TE>
<TE>   So, what went wrong with Brazilians' doomsday scenario that
portrayed steel tariffs as an economic disaster?</TE>
<TE>   Much of the steel exporters' success has to do with factors not in
their control. Brazil's devalued currency -- it has lost one-third of
its value against the dollar this year -- has made all its
commodities, especially steel, more competitive on global markets.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, recent U.S. steel prices of $350 a ton are high enough that
Brazilian steel still can compete even after import duties are paid.</TE>
<TE>   "As there is a shortage of steel in the U.S. market since the last
six months, the local prices have gone up to levels above
international steel prices, which make it possible to sell, even
paying the 30% surcharge," said CSN's export director, Luiz Ernesto
Migliora.</TE>
<TE>   Prices have skyrocketed this year mainly because shutdowns at
major steel companies LTV Corp. and Acme Metals Inc. eliminated 20%
of supplies in some categories of domestically produced steel, said
Christopher Plummer of Metal Strategies, a steel industry consulting
firm in West Chester, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilians also are reaping the rewards of high-quality iron ore,
low labor costs and investments in high technology that have made
their steel industry one of the most advanced in the world, said New
York-based Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. steel analyst Daniel Altman. These
factors also have helped push down the cost of production to about
half that of a typical U.S. steel plant.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian companies also have decided that if they can't beat U.S.
companies on the protection issue, they'll join them by buying U.S.
steel plants.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisitions mirror those of Brazilian orange juice
concentrate processors, which, frozen out of U.S. markets, have
snapped up several Florida juice companies in recent years to
circumvent trade barriers.</TE>
<TE>   With its purchase last year of Heartland Steel in Terre Haute,
Ind., CSN essentially bought a customer for its slab or bulk steel
made at its factories in Brazil. Heartland then takes the bulk steel
and produces finished steel products that are sold at much higher
prices. But CSN is restricted on how much slab it can ship to its
Indiana plant for finishing. And because there is a shortage of
U.S.-produced bulk steel, the plant is operating at only one-third
capacity, Migliora said. CSN also has expressed interest in taking
over Bethlehem Steel Corp., which last year filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Gerdau has purchased five plants in Canada, Florida and New Jersey
since the late 1980s, enabling it to expand its network of regionally
autonomous operations from those in Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   The ongoing problems in the U.S. steel industry also have helped
Brazil's competitiveness. The huge U.S. integrated steel companies
that survive after decades of bankruptcies and mergers are saddled
with high "legacy" costs -- the pension and health benefits of about
1 million retired steel workers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the pool of active steel workers whose wages they can
tap for pension and health fund contributions has shrunk to about
100,000, said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Washington-based
Economic Strategy Institute and a former trade negotiator during the
Reagan administration.</TE>
<TE>   To make up for the legacy cost shortfall, domestic producers must
raise prices for customers, charging as much as $100 a ton more than
producers in other parts of the world, according to David Phelps,
president of the American Institute for International Steel in
Washington. That inflated U.S. cost is why steel makers say they need
tariffs and quotas to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Brazilians can maintain their export momentum is open
to question. Optimists here note that the U.S. tariffs on foreign
steel imports will slowly recede over the next two years, thereby
easing the entry of Brazilian steel products.</TE>
<TE>   Prestowitz said Brazil's hand in trade matters, including steel,
may have been strengthened by the victory of leftist Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva in the recent presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the angst in the U.S. government over the Brazilian
economy, and with the new president in there, there is an incentive
here to make sure the Brazilian economy works, and that means letting
steel products in," Prestowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   But the shortage of U.S. steel manufacturing capacity that helped
drive up prices this year could evaporate in 2003 as other North
American companies ramp up production to fill the void.</TE>
<TE>   Lower prices would mean a smaller competitive window for
tariff-laden Brazilian imports.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Morici, a professor of international business at the
University of Maryland and chief economist of the International Trade
Commission during the Clinton administration, said the surcharges
have worked well so far, saving U.S. jobs with no apparent harm done
to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "We are seeing the reorganization of the U.S. steel industry,"
Morici said. "Consumers have seen no appreciable rise in prices of
cars or appliances or other products that are heavy users of steel."</TE>
<TE>   But Jose Augusto de Castro, director of the Brazilian Exporters
Assn. in Rio, disagrees. He says surcharges and quotas are affecting
producers around the world, skewing prices and production "without
any advantage to the United States."</TE>

<HD>Berkshire Hathaway May Buy GE Unit</HD>
<DH>Employers Reinsurance acquisition would make Warren
Buffett's firm world's biggest reinsurer by premium income.</DH>

<DL>OMAHA</DL>
<LD>Warren Buffett may buy General Electric Co.'s Employers Reinsurance
Corp., making the investor's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. the world's
biggest reinsurer by premium income, people familiar with the
situation said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Price is the major obstacle, they said. Buffett has offered less
than the $8 billion GE wants, questioning whether the unit has
sufficient loss reserves, they said. Berkshire increased loss
reserves at its principal reinsurance unit, General Reinsurance, by
$447 million in the first nine months.</LD>
<LD>   The acquisition would bolster Berkshire's premium income at a time
when bigger-than-expected claims and investment losses have eroded
earnings of Munich Re and Swiss Re, the No. 1 and No. 2 companies in
the business of buying portions of policies written by other
insurers. A sale would free Fairfield, Conn.-based GE of a unit it
expects to lose money this year as Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt
sheds slow-growing operations.</LD>
<TE>   "Buffett must think he is getting a lot of value on the deal,"
said Matthew Sauer, a money manager at Oak Value Capital Management,
which has about $1.5 billion of assets, including Berkshire shares.</TE>
<TE>   David Frail, a GE spokesman, declined to comment. Buffett, who
didn't return a call for comment, said in his annual letter to
investors in May that he was looking for acquisitions in the range of
$5 billion to $20 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We need elephants to make significant gains now, and they are
hard to find," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, GE shares closed at $25.10, down $1.01, while Berkshire
Hathaway's Class A shares rose $1,100 to close at $74,700. Both trade
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Omaha-based Berkshire gets about a third of its revenue from
reinsurance and more than half from insurance and reinsurance
combined.</TE>
<TE>   Reinsurers have raised prices by about 60% across all lines of
business since September 2001, as they pay claims from the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, as well as increased claims related to asbestos
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Employers Re, which GE acquired in 1984, lost $156 million in the
third quarter. GE Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherin said in
September the reinsurer would lose $350 million to $450 million this
year before breaking even next year.</TE>
<TE>   GE increased Employers Re's reserves by $900 million before taxes
through the third quarter and didn't renew about 40% of the policies
the unit wrote in 2000, Sherin said.</TE>
<TE>   The reinsurer, with assets of about $37 billion, employs about
3,700 of GE's 310,000 workers, according to the company's Web site.
The unit's book value is about $7 billion, said Michael Paisan, an
analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. in New York.</TE>

<HD>ABC-CNN Merger Talk Has Troops Spooked</HD>
<DH>As the struggling networks negotiate, fears of a culture
clash and layoffs rise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>On election day, CNN staffers looked up to see their larger-than-life
founder, Ted Turner, sweeping through the newsroom on a pep-rally
mission of handshakes and waves.</LD>
<LD>   "When Ted walked in the room, it really crystallized for me where
I am, what we are, how we changed the business," said anchor Aaron
Brown, who left ABC News for the 24-hour cable news network. "These
guys had a vision. This is really why we're here, for big nights."</LD>
<LD>   But it might well be Turner's last big night in an independent CNN
newsroom. His once-renegade baby is negotiating a merger with the
oh-so-establishment ABC News in a new company 70% owned by CNN parent
AOL Time Warner Inc. and 30% owned by ABC parent Walt Disney Co.</LD>
<TE>   Turner has been publicly silent on the possible deal (although he
is set to appear on Brown's "NewsNight" tonight, where he surely will
be asked). People familiar with the situation say he is supportive
one day, opposed the next. That apparent ambivalence sums up the
feelings of many far down the food chain at both news organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The deal has obvious, major financial benefits, at a time when
news gathering costs are soaring and competition for ad dollars is
fierce. But there is a rapidly building fear of a serious culture
clash between the two sides and the prospect of sizable layoffs, as
the two seek to pare $200 million from their combined costs.</TE>
<TE>   On election night, Turner said he had been told not to comment. "I
can talk about bison burgers and the weather," he joked. When
pressed, he quoted from "Bambi": "As Thumper said, 'My mother always
taught me, "If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at
all." ' " Laughing, he turned and said, "And you can write that he
walked away humming the tune 'Oh, we ain't got a barrel of
mon-ey....' "</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the merger is necessary -- but not necessarily
welcome.</TE>
<TE>   With deal points being swapped every couple of weeks, executives
are adamant that a pact, if any is to be made, won't come together
before the first quarter of 2003 and could take a year to implement.
Some tens of millions of dollars in savings on overlapping satellite
time would be instant, but larger savings in job cuts and
infrastructure would be imposed gradually over three to five years,
some insiders say. Others argue that the cuts would have to be made
more quickly because dragging out the integration of two corporate
cultures only makes it more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   That both AOL Time Warner Chief Executive Richard Parsons and
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner want to see a deal happen has
propelled the discussions. But the reality is that both companies
have more urgent priorities, including ABC's poor prime-time ratings
and AOL's struggling online division.</TE>
<TE>   So far, company insiders say, the two sides haven't even agreed to
make the talks exclusive, and either one of the companies' boards
could ultimately shoot down a merger. Eisner recently said chances of
a deal were "50/50," odds echoed by other executives.</TE>
<TE>   "We are exploring an opportunity, but there are benefits and risks
that must be considered," said Jamie Kellner, chairman and chief
executive of Turner Broadcasting System Inc., which oversees CNN.
"I'm committed to continuing to explore this, but at this point there
isn't enough information to commit to a deal."</TE>
<TE>   Executives said that while there is no one sticking point, issues
of control must still be worked out, including what the head of the
new organization can decide unilaterally and what must be cleared
collaboratively. There are also decisions to be made about such
things as the promotion time each side would commit to and what
compensation would be paid if, say, ABC cut back on a newsmagazine
hour.</TE>
<TE>   There also is skepticism among some rivals over how the two sides
can find $200 million in cuts. Merely closing overlapping bureaus,
they say, won't do it -- a fact not lost on CNN and ABC executives
who are looking for creative financing models.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, only one thing seems certain: The troops are
growing increasingly unsettled and scared.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors are rampant. The fact that Kellner and Disney President Bob
Iger shared a Halloween day lunch set off so much speculation of an
imminent deal that their companies had to publicly disavow it. CNN
News Group Chairman Walter Isaacson and ABC News President David
Westin, whose homes are kitty-corner in Bronxville, N.Y., jokingly
accused each other's companies of fueling the talk, as their children
went trick-or-treating that night.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another rumor, which recently swept ABC News, was that a list
already had been made of staffers targeted for layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Search my desk," Isaacson said during an interview, pointing to a
relatively clean desktop in his office overlooking CNN's Atlanta
headquarters newsroom. "We're not at that stage."</TE>
<TE>   Still, ABC employees, who are generally paid more than their CNN
counterparts, say they are particularly worried that on beats and in
cities where CNN and ABC have overlapping producers and
correspondents the higher-paid person will get laid off, regardless
of who is more qualified. Employees say Westin has been telling the
troops that they should wait and see, but that a deal could be
positive.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [a merger] can work," said David Bohrman, executive
producer of CNN's "NewsNight," as well as the election coverage. He
has worked at both networks, in addition to NBC. He recalled that
when TWA Flight 800 crashed, it was MSNBC's third day on the air. The
cable station provided NBC with immediate benefits.</TE>
<TE>   But, Bohrman said, "part of it is easy and part of it I can't
begin to think about."</TE>
<TE>   Though the two sides have different cultures (ABC News is more
focused on programs; CNN targets straight news gathering), Bohrman
said, there is also "a lot of cross-pollination." CNN long ago passed
the news renegade mantel to Fox News Channel. The CNN newsroom is
populated with former network newsies: Brown, Bohrman, Connie Chung,
Jeff Greenfield and Anderson Cooper from ABC alone.</TE>
<TE>   Sources at both companies said anchors have been supportive and
even signed off on the deal. But colleagues said ABC's Peter
Jennings, for one, has questions about what effect this will have on
the journalism. He declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The talent glut that could result from a merger has been a source
of intense questioning.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyer already compete for big
interviews. At CNN, its successful efforts in the last two years to
improve its once stodgy on-air image means it, too, must grapple with
that problem. That was apparent on election night, when Brown, Judy
Woodruff, Paula Zahn and Jeff Greenfield were all on the anchor desk
using hand signals to vie for air time, with 10 minutes each hour
also carved out for Larry King. Connie Chung had the night off.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, there are fewer CNN staffers who were there 22 years
ago, when Turner had his crazy vision of 24-hour news that shunned
stars and programs for getting facts on the air fast. A
pre-election-night party in Isaacson's two-level, stark-white Atlanta
loft, with trays of sushi and goblets of red wine, had an energy and
hipness that would have been inconceivable in CNN's scrappy early
days.</TE>
<TE>   Several people familiar with the situation said the current
thinking is to keep ABC and CNN editorially independent, with
producers choosing material from a shared pool of correspondents and
video.</TE>
<TE>   CNN is negotiating from a more confident position than it had even
two years ago, when employees were demoralized by dropping ratings,
layoffs and management turnover as the network tried to determine its
future course. Today, while Fox News has the ratings lead on cable,
CNN is focused and employees are pulling together, staffers said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have more reporters out there doing more journalism than ever
before. Sometimes it's not the flashiest thing out there, but it goes
right to the core of CNN's mission," Isaacson said.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, CNN has the air time that will be so crucial in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Election night in the state-of-the-art CNN control room was a
scene of controlled chaos, as producers debated if they had enough
information to make predictions of winners, tried to squeeze in
reports from field reporters and monitored the competition -- all
except ABC News.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's local Atlanta station preempted the network's national
coverage for its own reports. To some, that was proof enough of ABC's
need to hook up with a big cable partner to keep its best reporting
on the air.</TE>
<TE>   "Most employees I talk to aren't paranoid," just curious, Isaacson
said. "People have said to me that they truly see the logic here."</TE>

<HD>Firms Fined Over Product Hazards</HD>
<DH>U.S. Home &amp; Garden sold dangerous weeding equipment; STK's
toys posed choking risks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Francisco company has agreed to an $885,000 fine for failing to
report safety defects in a weed trimmer attachment linked to more
than a dozen injuries and the death of a 3-year-old girl.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Home &amp; Garden Inc. and a subsidiary will pay the civil
penalty for allegedly not telling the government of problems
associated with attachments to the Weed Wizard trimmer, the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission said.</LD>
<LD>   In a lawsuit filed in July, the government said the companies knew
of a February 1998 internal report that said the product could cause
serious injuries, but continued to sell it for more than two years
afterward. A metal chain link on the head of the weed trimmer can fly
off and cut through skin and bone, the commission said. In 1997, a
3-year-old Alabama girl was killed when a link came loose and lodged
in her skull.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate product safety case, a Los Angeles company pleaded
guilty to importing and selling toys with parts that pose a choking
hazard to young children.</TE>
<TE>   STK International Inc. must pay $270,000 in civil and criminal
penalties, the largest fine against a company in violation of "small
parts" laws and the first time both civil and criminal fines have
resulted from toy-related violations, the commission said.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S. Home &amp; Garden case, about 2.7 million Weed Wizard
trimmer heads with metal chains and about 857,000 trimmer replacement
chain sets were sold nationwide from May 1987 to April 2000, the
government said. The product was recalled by Weed Wizard Acquisition
Corp. in May 2000 after the company received several injury reports.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies that ignore our reporting requirements will be
penalized," said Hal Stratton, commission chairman.</TE>
<TE>   U.S Home &amp; Garden denied the allegations but entered into the
settlement to avoid litigation expenses, the company said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very pleased to bring closure to these matters without any
substantial financial burden being incurred by the company," Chief
Executive Robert Kassel said.</TE>
<TE>   The payment will be split between U.S. Home &amp; Garden and
subsidiary A.A.B.B. Inc., the company said.</TE>
<TE>   In the STK case, the company faced criminal penalties because of
repeat violations. In May 1997, STK paid an $80,000 fine for
importing products with parts too small for young children.</TE>
<TE>   Government monitoring from June 1997 to this July found that the
company continued to import toys deemed dangerous for children,
resulting in 12 criminal misdemeanor counts brought by the commission
and the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   STK has been ordered to inspect its products before importation.
Calls to the company were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   STK recalled about 110,000 toys in August 2001, including the 2
Piece Tambourine Set, Bathtime Water Wheel, Funny Loco Wind-Up and
Pull Back Duck in Boat.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to the company were not immediately returned.</TE>

<HD>Southland Theme Parks Betting on Big Holiday Crowds</HD>
<DH>Rising ticket prices and advance hotel bookings support a
projection of strong attendance this season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bonnie Harris</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This could be a jolly holiday for Southern California theme parks.</LD>
<LD>   Already, Walt Disney Co. is betting on strong attendance over the
holidays and has begun pushing the price of some tickets higher, a
sign that the days of unprecedented discounting to get people into
its parks since Sept. 11 may finally be over.</LD>
<LD>   The company last week raised the prices of its annual passes by
$6, and many are wondering if further hikes in admission are in the
offing.</LD>
<TE>   Many industry observers predict theme parks in general will enjoy
at least a 5% increase in business over the holidays this year, and
that the trend will continue in 2003 as families prefer to keep
taking trips within driving distance of their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Like everyone else we've experienced off attendance since Sept.
11," Disney spokesman Tom Brocato said. "But the bottom line is,
we're expecting a strong holiday season. Disneyland is a great place
to be for the holidays no matter what."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the higher prices for annual passes are still far
less than those offered 18 months ago, when a premium pass sold for
nearly $300. The new price is $225.</TE>
<TE>   "They are obviously feeling better about things this year, and
it's probably time that they do," said Tim O'Brien, senior editor of
Amusement Business, which tracks the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Advance bookings at Anaheim hotels are supporting the projection
of a strong holiday, and a spokeswoman at nearby Knott's Berry Farm
said they are expecting strong crowds to move between the Buena Park
theme park and the Disneyland Resort.</TE>
<TE>   At the Anaheim Hilton, bookings for Christmas and New Year's have
already outpaced last year's levels, said Edd Karlan, director of
sales and marketing. A year ago, the 1,600-room hotel had 900
reservations for the two-week Christmas holiday period; this year
that number has soared to 2,500. Room rates too have increased about
3% since 2001, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are way ahead this year," Karlan said, noting that the
majority of the reservations are coming from Arizona, Nevada and
Northern California. "Our drive-in market continues to help us out."</TE>
<TE>   Amusement parks usually benefit from such a travel trend because
attendance figures are boosted by local visitors. Six Flags Inc., for
example, estimates that 90% of its visitors drive from within a
150-mile radius of its 32 parks nationwide, which includes Magic
Mountain in Valencia. Disneyland puts that number at about 70%, and
Disney World in Florida gets half its patrons from nearby areas,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, smarting from the drop-off in attendance after the
Sept. 11 attacks, Disney did the unusual and rolled out a holiday
offer to get more Southern Californians into its parks by drastically
cutting the price of a two-day ticket. The discount came at a time
when a flurry of holiday shows, parades and seasonal displays
typically draw huge crowds to its Disneyland and California Adventure
parks.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's holiday season turned out better than expected for
theme parks, with many having to close the gates early because of
crowds and some, such as Legoland in Carlsbad, reporting record
numbers of visitors from Christmas to New Year's. Yet Disney
proceeded to slash the prices of its annual passes and make them
valid at both its parks.</TE>
<TE>   Disney then offered an unprecedented discount during the peak
summer season -- free admission to California Adventure for local
children accompanied by an adult, whose ticket also was significantly
reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Brocato wouldn't say whether the latest price hike is a precursor
to higher admission prices altogether. The company, however, reported
last week that revenue in its theme parks division declined 8% in the
fiscal year ended Sept. 30.</TE>

<DH>Energy merchant's new CEO considers which businesses to
keep to ensure its survival.</DH>

<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Two weeks into his new job as Dynegy Inc.'s chief executive, Bruce
Williamson is focusing on assets as the key to restoring the troubled
energy merchant -- which to keep, which to sell and what combination
offers the best route toward ensuring the company's future.</LD>
<LD>   "What Dynegy can become is an asset-based business," Williamson,
43, said in an interview with the Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   "We need to generate cash, which we continue to do. We need to
sell off the noncore assets. Then we need to pay down debt. When we
pay down debt, we get to a sustainable capital structure. And then
this business just takes off and goes on forward," he said Friday.</LD>
<TE>   But Dynegy faces enormous hurdles, with many analysts questioning
its prospects for survival.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock has hovered below $1 for weeks, and last week
its largest shareholder, ChevronTexaco Corp., said it would write off
most of its Dynegy investment. On Friday, shares fell 3 cents to 79
cents on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has about $1.3 billion in debt due next year, and is
looking for ways to renegotiate.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Houston-based Dynegy stepped up to buy Enron Corp.,
its larger, failing rival. But Dynegy walked away from the $8-billion
deal and Enron filed for bankruptcy amid a wave of accounting
scandals that have tainted the industry. Since then, Dynegy and other
energy merchants have faced fleeing investors, credit downgrades and
increased regulatory scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   This year Dynegy forced out top managers, fired traders and
announced plans to lay off hundreds of workers as it abandoned the
energy-trading business.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, El Paso Corp. became the third energy merchant this
year, behind Dynegy and Kansas City-based Aquila Inc., to announce
plans to abandon trading. Enron gave its trading business to UBS
Warburg in January in exchange for a third of future profits.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of trading, Dynegy will focus on its traditional energy
businesses, which include coal and natural gas-fired power plants,
and Illinois Power, which has about 650,000 gas and electricity
customers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an industrial business model, and that's our business
model," Williamson said. "What ultimately matters is, did you produce
and sell energy and deliver energy in a low-cost manner, and how did
you manage your business?"</TE>
<TE>   Williamson said the utilities, coupled with sound cash management
and asset sales, will enable Dynegy to ride out the weak economy.
Among the properties Dynegy has been shopping around is Rough, a
provider of natural gas storage in Britain and used by about half of
U.S. natural gas shippers. Dynegy paid $590 million for the storage
business last year.</TE>
<TE>   Williamson, a Montana native, was assistant treasurer at
Houston-based Shell Oil Co. from 1981 to 1995. He was vice president
of finance at PanEnergy Corp. in 1997 when that company merged with
Duke Energy Corp. Williamson left his job as president and CEO of
Duke's global markets division last month to take Dynegy's helm.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Dynegy announced a $1.8-billion third-quarter loss
fueled by low power prices and a flurry of one-time charges,
including costs related to its departure from the marketing and
trading business.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Hackett, chairman and chief executive of Ocean Energy in
Houston, worked with Williamson at PanEnergy and Duke. He called
Williamson "very deliberate, very paced, very tough-minded and very
fair."</TE>
<TE>   "He has an ability to strategize very well, and an ability to look
at how that strategy can be translated into action," Hackett said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Easterbrook, an analyst with Dain Rauscher Wessels, said
Williamson could find banks unwilling to renegotiate agreements if
the economy remains weak, despite Dynegy's decision to abandon
trading.</TE>
<TE>   "You have this highly leveraged company that needs to pay down
debt," Easterbrook said. "For banks to be willing to re-lend their
money again -- they may have a tough time convincing banks to do
that."</TE>

<HD>Gas Prices Hold Steady Except on the West Coast</HD>
<DH>Industry analyst says in California the average price per
gallon rose 8 cents in just two weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nationwide gas prices held steady for the last two weeks thanks to
plentiful supplies and falling crude costs, although California
drivers experienced a sharp jolt at the pump, an industry analyst
said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The average price for gasoline nationally, including all grades
and taxes, was about $1.49 per gallon, up less than a penny since the
Oct. 23 survey, according to the Lundberg Survey of 8,000 stations
nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   "Prices have been on the rise recently on the West Coast, but
those rising prices were offset by falling prices in the Gulf and
Midwest regions," Trilby Lundberg said.</LD>
<TE>   In California, the average price for gasoline was $1.56 per
gallon, an 8-cent increase in just two weeks, according to Lundberg.</TE>
<TE>   The Automotive Club of Southern California attributed the price
hike to a variety of factors, including jitters over a possible war
with Iraq and fears of supply interruption after the Nov. 3 Alaskan
earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   But Lundberg said the long-term forecast calls for optimism. "At
this time, wholesale prices are falling in all parts of the country,
suggesting that retail prices will soon grind to a halt, including
California," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gas prices have been "extraordinarily steady" since April,
Lundberg said. Prices rose by 4 cents per gallon in late September
and early October but the trend soon waned.</TE>
<TE>   The national weighted average price of gasoline, including taxes,
at self-serve pumps Friday was about $1.46 per gallon for regular,
$1.56 for mid-grade and $1.65 for premium.</TE>

<HD>Trade Slowdown Worries Japanese</HD>
<DH>Current account surplus shrinks 6.8% from a year earlier,
signaling that the prospect of an export- led economic recovery may
be receding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>The surplus on Japan's current account, the broadest measure of trade
in goods and services, fell for the first time in a year in September
as slowing exports threatened to remove the main prop from an
economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Data to be released today show that the current account surplus
fell 6.8% in September from a year earlier to $9.76 billion, putting
an end to 11 straight months of growth and falling short of
forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   Economists had expected a surplus of about $10.6 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Gross domestic product figures for July-September, to be released
Wednesday, are likely to show slight growth for the quarter, but some
economists expect that to be the last growth for some time as Japan
feels the chill from a global slowdown and particularly from a
stuttering U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   Most economists expect exports to make a negative contribution to
GDP for the first time in a year.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese manufacturers are paring estimates for profit as demand
from the U.S., Japan's biggest overseas market, cools.</TE>
<TE>   "The rebound in exports is already falling apart," Hitoshi Asaoka,
an economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute, told Bloomberg News.
"The chances are getting greater that Japan's economy may start
declining toward the end of this year."</TE>
<TE>   The world's No. 2 economy is emerging from its third recession in
a decade. Growth probably slowed to 0.5% in the third quarter from
the previous quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's trade surplus grew 2.0% from a year earlier to $9.9
billion, the pace of growth slowing from earlier this year in line
with weaker exports.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the current account surplus fell for the first time
in a year shows that the prospect of an export-led economic recovery
is receding," said Shuji Shirota, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort
Wasserstein.</TE>

<HD>Uncertainty Raised as Stocks Sputter</HD>
<DH>Investors are jittery in face of Fed rate cut. But
corporate earnings, Republicans' victory and history point to a
possible rally in '03.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Are stocks just taking a breather -- or did yet another "bear market
rally" just take its last breath?</LD>
<LD>   After four weeks of strong gains, the major U.S. market indexes
hit a wall last week, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq
composite retreating 0.7% and 0.1%, respectively, while the Dow Jones
industrial average eked out a 0.2% gain to close Friday at 8,537.13.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks cooled Thursday and Friday even though the Republicans
regained control of the Senate in Tuesday's elections, and despite
the Federal Reserve surprising Wall Street on Wednesday with a
half-point cut in its key short-term interest rate, to a 41-year low
of 1.25%.</LD>
<TE>   With the Dow up 20.4% from its five-year low reached Oct. 9
through Wednesday, some investors may have become jittery in the
aftermath of the Fed's decision: Might policymakers know something
investors didn't know about the economy -- something troubling?</TE>
<TE>   "People are still trying to figure out whether this is just
another bear market rally, or finally the beginning of the recovery
phase," said Subodh Kumar, strategist at CIBC World Markets in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Several strong rallies have quickly sputtered during the bear
market of the last 2 1/2 years, most recently the five-week advance
during July and early August, which gave way to another plunge in
September and early October.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many strategists are guardedly optimistic that the market
has finally bottomed and that 2003 could be a pleasant surprise. They
say stocks will get a lift from lower interest rates, the Republican
victory and corporate earnings that are recovering, though gradually.</TE>
<TE>   Along with economic questions, however, uncertainty over possible
war with Iraq could thwart or limit any further advance, strategists
say.</TE>
<TE>   Although earnings are far from robust and many companies, such as
networking giant Cisco Systems Inc., have warned that the outlook
remains shaky, overall profits continue to rebound after the deep
decline of 2001, according to data tracker Thomson First Call of
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   With 90% of the S&amp;P 500 companies having reported third-quarter
results, First Call said operating earnings were up 6.8% from a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Companies have beaten analysts' expectations by 2.4 percentage
points, on average, though that partly reflects managements' success
in previously guiding down Wall Street's estimates for the quarter.
The performance also reflects the easy comparisons with depressed
2001 profits.</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth quarter, analysts' profit projections also have
been declining, but they still expect 16.7% growth for the S&amp;P 500
companies overall, according to First Call.</TE>
<TE>   For all of 2003, analysts now expect S&amp;P 500 earnings to rise
14.9% from 2002. That estimate has fallen from 17.8% as of Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Though growth expectations may have to be lowered, some recent
developments could help bolster results, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   For example, profits of U.S. multinational companies could get a
boost from renewed weakness in the dollar, said Robert Nichols,
chairman of Windward Capital Management in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The euro currency rose to $1.01 on Friday, up from 97 cents in
mid-October and the highest level since early 2000. The rising euro
should help U.S. firms in Europe when revenue there is translated
back into dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most significantly, the election and the Fed's latest rate
cut are likely to benefit stocks in the near term, Nichols said.</TE>
<TE>   With Republicans back in control of the Senate, they may be able
to get an economic-stimulus package through Congress that lowers
capital gains taxes, eliminates or reduces the double taxation of
dividends and offers businesses tax credits for capital spending and
hiring new employees, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the kind of thing that worked wonders for the economy in the
mid-1980s," Nichols said.</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating the double taxation of dividend income could have an
enormous effect, he said. After-tax money that companies distribute
to shareholders in the form of dividends now is taxed as ordinary
income.</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating or reducing income taxes on dividends could make
stocks much more appealing to investors. It also could encourage more
companies to pay out more of their profit to shareholders as
dividends.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine the pressure that would be exerted on these
arrogant managements whose attitude is, 'We can manage this money
better than you can'?" Nichols said. "Shareholders would be
rewarded."</TE>
<TE>   As for the interest rate picture, the Fed's move last week will
drive short-term savings rates to new generational lows. That could
put more pressure on investors in search of higher returns to
allocate cash savings to stocks or bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The average seven-day yield on money market mutual funds, now
1.2%, is expected to drop to about 0.7% over the next six weeks,
tracking the Fed's cut.</TE>
<TE>   If even a modest portion of the $2 trillion-plus in money market
funds were to move into the stock market, it could have a big effect
on share prices, some analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Historical trends also are in the stock market's favor, said
Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader's Almanac in Old Tappan,
N.J. For one thing, stocks have entered what is often their sweet
spot, November through April.</TE>
<TE>   As for 2003, history says stocks tend to fare well during periods
of unified GOP control of Washington, Hirsch said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the third year of any presidency is often the best for
stocks. Since 1929, the Dow has risen an average of 12.9% in the
third presidential year, versus 4.2% in the first, 5.2% in the second
and 5.5% in the fourth, Hirsch said.</TE>
<TE>   The third-year performance usually has been attributed to the
sitting president's efforts to boost the economy as he prepares to
run for the White House again.</TE>

<HD>Tenet Under Closer Exam</HD>
<DH>Chae Hyun Moon had his patients' respect, if not love. Now
many wonder about him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Streitfeld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>REDDING</DL>
<LD>REDDING -- Chae Hyun Moon might have wanted to be a doctor since he
was a little boy, but his staunchest supporters agree with his
sharpest critics: He missed the class on bedside manners.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, my Lord, he gives you a heart attack just talking to you,"
said Lee Cook. The retired computer systems analyst still shudders at
the memory of Moon shouting at him not to hang onto the bar of the
treadmill during a stress test.</LD>
<LD>   Clifford Baker, a Presbyterian missionary, recalls a 1996 hospital
stay when he was experiencing congestive heart failure. "You've got
about three months straight downhill," Moon told him. Out in the
hallway, Moon advised Baker's wife to make sure the will was in
order.</LD>
<TE>   So many patients, so little time for chitchat. In his 23 years as
a cardiologist here, Moon has worked on as many as 35,000 people. On
some days, he would perform 10 catheterizations, where a thin tube is
inserted to open clogged arteries or obtain diagnostic information.
Another doctor would consider it a full day's work to do three.</TE>
<TE>   For a long time, Moon had the respect, if not love, of his
patients at Redding Medical Center. Twelve days ago, that image
abruptly darkened when the FBI filed an affidavit detailing an
investigation of Moon and the center's chairman of cardiac surgery,
Fidel Realyvasquez. The affidavit outlines a conspiracy to commit
health-care fraud by allegedly billing Medicare for unnecessary
procedures. Forty agents raided the doctors' offices, carting away
boxes of patient records.</TE>
<TE>   No charges have been filed, let alone proved. Yet the claim in the
67-page affidavit that "there is reason to believe that many" Redding
Medical patients "have been victims of a scheme" involving
"unnecessary invasive coronary procedures" is shaking this city and
causing ripples far beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a horror story, at best," said Gary Oxley, a nurse who
works with Moon and believes the allegations are untrue.</TE>
<TE>   Moon, who has told colleagues that everything he did was in the
best interests of his patients, did not respond to requests for an
interview at the hospital, his office or house here. But
conversations with colleagues and former and current patients as well
as a review of court documents describe an assertive, often arrogant
doctor, one who couldn't be bothered with pleasantries, hobbies or
critics. For better or worse, his patients have been his life.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Slew of Lawsuits</TE>
<TE>   For all the advances in technology, cardiac care can still be as
much art as science. Redding Medical was home to the best machines
and receptive to the latest ideas. To his admirers, and there are
still many here, Moon saw further and knew more. He prevented heart
attacks, extending the life and health of many patients.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit presents a far more chilling scenario, which is that
Moon violated the ancient medical oath to "first, do no harm." One
case briefly detailed by the FBI: A 59-year-old male received bypass
surgery and, four years later, is still too weak to work. A
cardiologist who reviewed the man's records for the FBI "found, at
most, evidence of a relatively minor problem," the affidavit says.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation, which will take months, is roiling the owner of
Redding Medical Center, Santa Barbara-based Tenet Healthcare Corp.
Tenet, which owns 113 hospitals around the country, last week
revealed a federal audit of its Medicare billing practices. Between
the Redding investigation and the audit, Tenet's stock has declined
by two-thirds, shaving more than $15 billion off its market
capitalization. Analysts have downgraded the stock, saying Tenet's
moneymaking ways are threatened.</TE>
<TE>   In this former logging community turned vacation jump-off point,
Moon is a more personal matter. The Redding Medical Center draws
patients from the entire northern half of the state, and Moon is its
star. Everyone, it seems, knows someone who's been a patient or who
works for the hospital. It's the most dominant building downtown,
except for the jail, and was going to get even bigger. Before the
events of the last two weeks, the 238-bed center was to double in
size.</TE>
<TE>   In a search for more business, Redding Medical recently mailed out
fliers that showed a trim woman with a basketful of healthful
groceries.</TE>
<TE>   "After grocery shopping, a few errands and one load of laundry, a
42-year-old woman collapsed of a heart attack," the flier warns. "And
you thought heart disease was just a man's problem."</TE>
<TE>   The "lifestyle risk factors" listed are very broad, including
"increasing age."</TE>
<TE>   Such an approach can save lives, but it's also ripe for abuse.
When does aggressive prevention cross over into unnecessary
operations? It's a question many of Moon's former patients are being
forced to ask themselves. Some are emerging with their faith intact.
Some are uncertain what to think. And some are filing lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers are running ads in the local paper and on television,
trolling for victims. One local firm says it will file more than 100
suits all by itself.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   High Self-Esteem</TE>
<TE>   When Moon plays golf, he does it on Sunday morning. By 10 a.m.,
he's at the hospital, still in his golf clothes, bragging about how
well he played or joking about a missed shot.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a workaholic day and night--24/7, 365. He can be there in
five minutes at 3 in the morning," said Robert Hansen, an
anesthesiologist. "I don't think he knows how to take a vacation. If
I were him, I would have burnt out a long time ago."</TE>
<TE>   Moon, 55, was born in Seoul, the son of an orthopedic surgeon and
a volunteer for the Korean Red Cross. He studied medicine at Yonsei
University, one of the preeminent schools in the country.</TE>
<TE>   His goal was to be a surgeon like his father, he told the Redding
Record Searchlight in a lengthy interview in 1994, but back trouble
made it impossible to stay on his feet for hours at a time in the
operating room. After coming to the U.S. in 1972, he decided to
specialize in heart disease, the leading cause of death.</TE>
<TE>   Moon trained in New York, moved to Cleveland and then made a rapid
transit of Orange County, working in seven hospitals in little over a
year. In 1979, he arrived in Redding, which he said reminded him of
Korea: clear skies, mountains, quiet.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Sun, raised two boys and a girl here, all now
grown. Moon contributed to the symphony and funded a high school
science scholarship. But mostly he worked.</TE>
<TE>   His self-esteem never seems to have been low, but over the years
it blossomed.</TE>
<TE>   "How dare you get a second opinion," an "enraged" Moon is quoted
in a wrongful-death lawsuit filed Friday as saying to a 74-year-old
patient with no prior history of heart disease. "I built this heart
program!"</TE>
<TE>   Moon also has clashed with the other hospital in town, Mercy
Medical, suing it in December 1997 for violating federal anti-trust
statutes. In September 1999 the suit was dismissed, but Moon
continued to rag on the competition a few blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   "Those boys at Mercy don't even know" what the latest heart
technology is, he is quoted telling one patient in the FBI affidavit.
"They have an 8% mortality rate; we have 2%."</TE>
<TE>   Mercy declines to talk about Moon, issuing a blanket statement:
"We have no information to offer, and feel it would be inappropriate
to comment." The statement adds that Mercy did not request the FBI
investigation, which many of Moon's supporters claim.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a terrible, terrible personality," said Betty Cook, who
now believes that Moon's insertion of a stent to widen her husband
Lee's artery was unnecessary. "He doesn't talk like you and I are
talking. He shouts and yells and demands."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Cook also remembers approaching Moon after the operation and
saying, "I'm sure happy we have a cardiologist like you in Redding.
It makes us feel better, to know we're in good hands."</TE>
<TE>   And Moon, not gruff for once, said, "That means the world to me to
hear you say that. You've made my day."</TE>
<TE>   The brusqueness has cultural roots, one nurse said. The American
tradition of analyzing everything, making sure the patient is
comfortable, isn't necessarily the way medicine is practiced
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   So too with Moon's worst habit, smoking. He didn't try to hide it,
and even laughed about it. "Koreans," he would say, "don't get heart
disease."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Patients</TE>
<TE>   Some former patients, even now, have a benign view of Moon.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope he gets vindicated," said 67-year-old Ruben Martinez, a
print-shop owner who lives in nearby Weaverville. Two years ago,
Martinez had chest pains. His doctor checked him out and was worried
enough to helicopter the patient 40 miles to Redding Medical.</TE>
<TE>   "They were doing the work-up on me when I started having pains.
Dr. Moon walked in. He wasn't even supposed to be there that day. He
came in and said, 'This man is having a heart attack,' " Martinez
said. "I was lucky he wasn't out buying shoes like he intended to do
that day."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI affidavit speculates that at least half of Redding
Medical's patients really did need surgery, and another quarter fell
into a gray area of having a minor amount of heart disease. As for
the rest, "there existed no indication of any heart disease that
would warrant surgical intervention of any kind."</TE>
<TE>   That means thousands of patients are wondering about their own
cases. One of them is Larry Clifford, an electrical engineer who saw
Moon because of his tendency to fall asleep at odd times.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt I was in good hands," Clifford said. "He was very
arrogant, always saying, 'I'm the best.' He said he was one of the
best cardiologists in the United States. He had a pretty bad beside
manner, but that was OK. Zing-zing and he's gone."</TE>
<TE>   Clifford ended up having a five-way bypass. "When I was leaving
there, they convinced me I was a ... lucky person that they happened
to find this. And maybe that's the case. But I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   No one is likely to be sure for months, if not years, if ever.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in innocent until proven guilty," said Terry Zeller, a
nurse who has worked with Moon. "But he'll never be completely
exonerated from this in the court of public opinion. There will
always be a question."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Good Life</TE>
<TE>   If Moon, as his supporters assert, was good for Redding, Redding
was also good to Moon. He and Sun, a sculptor, live on the far
outskirts of town. White pillars and a black gate, decorated with two
"private property" signs, keep the unwanted world at bay.</TE>
<TE>   "No comment, please," a woman says over the intercom. 'You can
contact our lawyers." The lawyer, John Reese Jr., didn't return
calls.</TE>
<TE>   The driveway winds up the hill and out of sight. According to tax
records, the unseen house was built in 1991 and has 6,180 square
feet. Its assessed value is $835,756. A neighbor -- he lives
practically next door but has never met the doctor -- says Moon built
a painting studio in the back.</TE>
<TE>   Moon's abstract canvases are the most unusual thing about him,
colleagues say; such a contemplative activity doesn't seem to fit in
with his type-A personality. But Moon's interest in art is long-held.
His sister, his parents-in-law and other relatives are artists. He
recently sponsored an art show here, one friend said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the raid, Moon has been trying to carry on. Baker, the
Presbyterian missionary who was given a death sentence by Moon six
years ago, had an appointment last Wednesday. "The office was
jammed," he reports.</TE>
<TE>   Baker was getting his pacemaker tested. Unexpectedly, Moon came
in.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rotten thing," Baker said to him.</TE>
<TE>   Moon replied he was being "crucified" in the Redding paper. He
said he'd heard there had been close to a thousand letters in his
support sent to the editor, but none had been published.</TE>
<TE>   Tom King, editor of the Record Searchlight, said the paper has
received about "20 or 30" letters, a few signed by multiple people,
in support of the doctors. He added that the paper has received an
equal number of letters detailing unverified allegations against
them. None of the letters from either group has been published.</TE>
<TE>   The faithful have had no trouble making their feelings known on an
immense banner outside the hospital's catheter lab.</TE>
<TE>   "We Support Our Doctors," it proclaims. By Saturday, there was no
space left to add comments. Some were grammatically suspect, but the
meaning was always clear. "Dr. Moon your great." "Thank you for
saving the life of my father-in-law and my wife." "Your #1." "Keep
the faith. This too shall pass." "I trust you. You saved me."</TE>
<TE>   When Moon first saw it, one witness said, he broke down in tears,
sobbing uncontrollably, saying he couldn't believe what was
happening. Two colleagues had to hold him.</TE>
<TE>   The state medical board has petitioned for a temporary restraining
order to stop Moon and Realyvasquez from practicing.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the petition, there was a declaration from Vincent Yap,
chief of cardiology at Kaiser Richmond Medical Center. "It is my
strong professional opinion that neither Dr. Moon nor Dr.
Realyvasquez can safely practice medicine, and each poses a threat to
patients," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Online Movie Service Launches</HD>
<DH>Five major studios will offer films that can be downloaded
to a PC through Movielink.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five major movie studios plan to begin offering films via the
Internet today through Movielink, Hollywood's most aggressive move
yet onto the Web.</LD>
<LD>   The long-awaited service is designed to open a new path for movies
into the home, relying on the Internet and digital bits instead of
physical media such as videotapes or DVDs. Its initial lineup of
about 175 movies will be available only to U.S. consumers with
high-speed Internet connections, who will be forced to watch the
films on computers powered by Microsoft Windows unless they can
connect their television sets to their PCs.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts say Santa Monica-based Movielink faces several hurdles
that could take years to overcome, most notably the fact that the
vast majority of consumers aren't equipped to watch the service's
films on their TVs.</LD>
<TE>   "The average movie-lover is not going to run out on Monday and try
this," said P.J. McNealy of GartnerG2, a technology research and
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for Movielink and several of its Hollywood sponsors said
they view the first few years as a time for experimentation and
discovery, not profit.</TE>
<TE>   A main goal for the studios, they said, is to avoid the fate of
the record companies. Most major labels didn't make their songs
available through the Net until after online piracy became rampant,
leading some observers to wonder whether they'll ever regain control
of their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to start the process and get this service up and running,
test it, get feedback, and spend the necessary time to perfect it,"
said Rick Finkelstein, president and chief operating officer of
Universal Pictures, a subsidiary of Vivendi Universal. "You want to
be sure that you're there when the demand occurs. Otherwise, there's
a risk that the pirates come in and occupy this space."</TE>
<TE>   The five studios behind Movielink -- Universal, Sony Corp.'s Sony
Pictures Entertainment, AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros., Viacom
Inc.'s Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.'s MGM Studios
-- have each made a five-year commitment to the service, with an
eventual investment of more than $100 million, said Yair Landau,
president of Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "This service is not so much about what it is today but what it
can become," said Landau, who started working on the project in early
1999. "It's not about what the market for movies on PCs is, it's
about what Internet delivery of movies can evolve to."</TE>
<TE>   A handful of companies has already tried to deliver movies and
other forms of video through the Internet, with limited success.
Downloadable digital movie files are so large that it can take more
than an hour to deliver them even with a high-speed connection. And
"streamed" movies, which play on a user's computer as they're being
transmitted, typically don't offer as clear or steady a picture as a
TV set.</TE>
<TE>   A more serious problem has been the studios' reluctance to let
unaffiliated companies offer their movies online. One video-on-demand
company, Intertainer Inc. of Culver City, recently filed an antitrust
suit against several studios for allegedly withholding titles and
colluding to favor Movielink. The Justice Department is examining
whether the studios' online practices violate antitrust laws.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the survivors still welcome Movielink to the marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   "We're thrilled that Movielink is launching," said Curt Marvis,
chief executive of CinemaNow Inc., a video-on-demand service in
Marina del Rey. "You never want to be the only horse in a race."</TE>
<TE>   Movielink CEO Jim Ramo said the service will offer every movie
from the five participating studios that's available for pay-per-view
on cable or satellite TV, starting 45 days after the movies appear in
video stores. Initially, about two-thirds of the movies on the
service will be older titles, but about 15 new releases will be added
per month, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For about the same price as a pay-per-view film -- $3 to $5 per
title -- users can download movies to a computer and keep them for up
to 30 days. The downloading process, however, could take 45 to 90
minutes on a typical high-speed phone or cable connection. Users can
keep the movies for only 24 hours once they start to play them.</TE>
<TE>   Software from RealNetworks Inc. and Microsoft Corp. is designed to
prevent the movies from being copied or played on any device other
than the computer that downloaded them, Ramo said. When anti-piracy
technology gets more advanced, he said, Movielink intends to allow
customers to burn movies onto DVDs and play them on other devices.</TE>
<TE>   Movielink's backers say they're eager to see its movies migrate
from computers to TVs and hand-held devices. One of the first
extensions probably will be to game consoles, particularly
Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2, which is incorporating
RealNetworks' software.</TE>
<TE>   "Our expectation is, we're going to learn a heck of a lot by
launching this and getting something out in front of the consumer,"
said Kevin Tsujihara, executive vice president of corporate business
development and strategy for Warner Bros. "What's going to enable the
Internet to become a viable distribution channel is going to be
heavily dependent on what consumer electronics companies [build] and
what consumers buy."</TE>
<TE>   Movielink serves at least two other purposes for the studios. It
gives them a new bargaining chip when negotiating deals with cable TV
and other distributors. It also could help the studios in Washington
as they urge Congress to mandate uniform anti-piracy technologies in
computers and consumer electronic devices.</TE>

<HD>Giving the Big Apple  a Taste of L.A.'s Core</HD>
<DH>Boosters are heading to New York this week to encourage
investment in downtown projects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>L.A. to New York: Our downtown isn't a joke anymore.</LD>
<LD>   That's the message that a squadron of heavyweight Angeleno
boosters, led by billionaire philanthropist and businessman Eli
Broad, will take to the Big Apple this week when they meet with some
of the biggest money managers in the world. Their goal: to convince
the New York crowd that much of what they think they know about
downtown Los Angeles is wrong or outdated, and that it's now a great
place to invest lots and lots of cash.</LD>
<LD>   Confronting the visitors are perceptions such as the one held by
New York real estate mogul Donald Trump, who didn't hesitate to thump
Los Angeles from his office on Fifth Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   "The downtown area has heretofore been sort of a depressing
place," said Trump, who recently bought Ocean Trails Golf Club in
Rancho Palos Verdes. "It needs people. It needs life."</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s emissaries think they can change such viewpoints now that
the central city is enjoying a burst of cultural growth accompanying
the construction of Staples Center, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels, Walt Disney Concert Hall and thousands of units of housing.</TE>
<TE>   "Lenders should be more comfortable with our city," said Broad,
who has contributed millions of dollars to such downtown cultural
institutions as Disney Hall and the Museum of Contemporary Art.</TE>
<TE>   But Manhattan-based lenders and investors often think of the heart
of Los Angeles as short on substance and style, and they punish
downtown by steering their money to cities such as San Francisco and
Chicago, which have more of the street life and culture enjoyed in
New York, Broad and other civic leaders say.</TE>
<TE>   "People have looked at Los Angeles and said there is no there
there," Broad said. "That's all changing. Our job is to show them
what's changing."</TE>
<TE>   Joining Broad on the trip are Tim Leiweke, president of Anschutz
Entertainment Group, which developed Staples Center; John Cushman,
chairman of real estate services company Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc.;
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jan Perry; and Carol Schatz, president
and chief executive of the Downtown Center Business Improvement
District.</TE>
<TE>   The group will make a two-hour presentation to about 50 financiers
at a breakfast meeting Thursday at the posh Plaza Hotel as the high
point of a visit Schatz said will cost her organization about
$45,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't expect people to pay attention unless we took the
highest-level group of downtown stakeholders and entrepreneurs to
meet with the highest level of the investment community in New York,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Backing up Schatz and the other speakers will be a handful of
other prominent downtowners including Jonathan Kevles, deputy mayor
of economic development, and Bob Graziano, president of the Los
Angeles Dodgers. They'll be on hand to chat with guests.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that some of Los Angeles' most well-connected, wealthy
individuals are crossing the country with their hats in their hands
is a testament to New York's position as the financial center of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "Investment spins out of New York," said Tim Walker, a partner at
MaguirePartners, the largest landlord in downtown Los Angeles.
"Foreign investment, pension funds -- most of it transfers through
Manhattan."</TE>
<TE>   MaguirePartners has refinanced some of its downtown properties
over the last few years, and Walker said some of his New York
financial partners didn't realize that the pace of improvement in
central city L.A. has accelerated.</TE>
<TE>   Having two measures on the Nov. 5 ballot to break off parts of Los
Angeles didn't help its image, Anschutz Entertainment's Leiweke said.</TE>
<TE>   "I travel a lot and so I hear a lot of different impressions,"
Leiweke said. "People think L.A. is about the secession battle. In
the eyes of others we're dysfunctional. There is an impression that
L.A. is a tough city to get things done in."</TE>
<TE>   One of Leiweke's goals in New York is to make a case for funding a
large hotel as part of a retail and theater complex. Anschutz
Entertainment plans to build a 1,200-room, $280-million hotel next to
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the most important piece of economic development that has
to be accomplished and realized here" because the convention center,
other hotels, retailers and restaurants would all benefit from the
big conventions it could support, Leiweke said. "A lot of the
financing will probably come from the companies based out of New
York."</TE>
<TE>   At least one New York money man already is bullish on downtown Los
Angeles. Peter Ginsberg, a director of fund manager Capital Trust,
said that in the last eight months his company has placed $130
million in loans on four office buildings including Library Tower.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown is "a relatively stable to strengthening market, with
good relative value compared to the Greater Los Angeles area and
other central business districts in the country," Ginsberg said. It's
also getting more interesting, he said. "When the Disney Concert Hall
opens [next year], it will become even more dynamic."</TE>
<TE>   Even Trump, for all his talk about lack of life in downtown Los
Angeles, is evidently taking a look at the city.</TE>
<TE>   In town over the weekend to mark his acquisition of the Ocean
Trails Golf Club, Trump said he met with Cushman last week in New
York to discuss the possibility of building a residential high-rise
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Trump didn't say exactly where he might consider putting such an
edifice, but he left little doubt that any project he's involved with
probably would be on a grand scale. "I would not be surprised if I
came to Los Angeles and built Trump Tower," he said, referring to the
58-story luxury residential and retail complex he developed in the
early 1980s in midtown Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Cushman, who has a reputation as a tireless negotiator, bristled
when he learned that Trump had called L.A.'s core "depressing."</TE>
<TE>   "Remember, he lives in a world full of pizazz and sizzle," said
Cushman, who considers Trump a friend. "Downtown L.A. is much more
fundamental."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Cushman, the dean of L.A.'s office brokers, maintains that
the center of the city has the highest-quality collection of office
buildings on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   And someone in the room Thursday may want to buy one of the
largest, Arco Plaza, which is on the market with an estimated value
of about $275 million.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Perry hopes to draw attention to development
opportunities on Figueroa Street between downtown and USC.</TE>
<TE>   She also would like to see more housing projects get underway.</TE>
<TE>   "Investment opportunities are being created in areas that not long
ago were not under consideration," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Broad points to the vast investments already going on downtown as
proof of its viability. A combined $1.43 billion has been committed
since 1999 on Staples Center, the rehabilitation of City Hall, Los
Angeles Center Studio, the cathedral, Disney Hall and the new
Caltrans headquarters at 1st and Main streets scheduled to open in
2004.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 housing units are under construction downtown,
according to Schatz's group.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 5,800 units are proposed or in various stages of
planning.</TE>
<TE>   "To have this renaissance continue or accelerate, we have to
convince investors or lenders in the East that this is the place to
be," Broad said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to lay that foundation and answer whatever questions they
may have."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to fill a void created by the pullback of Japanese banks from
the California market, a group of Japanese American investors have
set up their own bank in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Tucked away in a mini-mall at the edge of Little Tokyo, Pacific
Commerce Bank is believed to be the only Japanese American-owned bank
operating outside of Hawaii. Backed by 160 investors and $7.6 million
in capital, the small bank is hoping to build its base around the
Japanese American and Japanese expatriate communities.</LD>
<LD>   The lack of a Japanese American bank is striking, given the
success of ethnic banks in other Asian communities. San Marino-based
East West Bank, one of several dozen banks serving Southern
California's Chinese community, is the third-largest commercial bank
based in Los Angeles, with $3.2 billion in assets. Hanmi Bank, which
has $1.4 billion in assets and is headquartered in Los Angeles'
Koreatown, is the largest of 10 community banks serving the region's
Korean community.</LD>
<TE>   "We need to have a bank for our community that provided the
services we are used to," said Ken Kasamatsu, 56, president and chief
executive of Pacific Commerce Bank, which opened its doors last
month.</TE>
<TE>   Though they are launching in difficult times, Pacific Commerce
executives believe they can succeed by providing the personal service
they say is disappearing as Japanese banks such as Sumitomo Bank,
Sanwa Bank and Asahi Bank pull out of California or are swallowed up
by U.S. financial institutions. They said their bank would offer
bilingual staff with a knowledge of the Southland Japanese community
and expertise in Japanese culture and business practices.</TE>
<TE>   At Pacific Commerce Bank, Kasamatsu and his staff of nine pride
themselves on knowing customers' names and hand out business cards
with a direct telephone line. The bank, which offers retail and
commercial services, has 130 customers.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Ogino, a 52-year-old insurance agent from Arcadia, is an
investor in the bank and also has opened a checking account. He said
he felt he would get better service from a smaller bank.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of like the idea of not being just a number," said Ogino,
who has known Kasamatsu's family for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Kasamatsu was with Sumitomo Bank's California subsidiary for 31
years until it was sold to Zions Bancorporation in 1998 and became
the backbone of Zions' California Bank &amp; Trust unit. In September,
United California Bank, the result of a merger between the California
subsidiaries of Japan's Sanwa Bank and Tokai Bank, was sold to San
Francisco-based Bank of the West for $2.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   He said those banks have not only cut back on their bilingual
staff and other services but also have reduced their involvement in
community activities such as Nisei Week, which is held each August in
Little Tokyo and is the nation's longest-running Japanese American
festival.</TE>
<TE>   Competition Remains</TE>
<TE>   But Pacific Commerce's bigger and better-financed competitors
aren't about to give up without a fight. Little Tokyo's businesses
have been struggling with the decline in Japanese tourism after last
year's terrorist attacks. But since the Office Depot retailing
complex on 2nd Street and Alameda Avenue opened more than a year ago,
traffic in the neighborhood has increased and there are new projects
in the works, including a 127-unit condominium project. The Japanese
American community is known for its good savers and reliable
borrowers, according to bankers.</TE>
<TE>   California Bank &amp; Trust spokesman Steven Borg said his bank has
maintained a bilingual staff at its Little Tokyo branch and offers a
variety of services aimed at that community, including automated
teller machine services in Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   "Our focus hasn't changed and we remain committed to that market,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Kendrick, an executive vice president at Union Bank of
California, which is majority-owned by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.,
said his bank also offers similar services for the Japanese
community. But he said even a small player in today's competitive
banking environment needs to look beyond a narrow ethnic base to
survive.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the communities that at one time were very dominated by
Japanese American people and immigrants have now very much
diversified," he said. "There's a strong Hispanic influence moving
into the Little Tokyo area. You no longer have the purity of that
micro-market that you did 30 to 40 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   The backers of Pacific Commerce Bank hope the bank can help
revitalize a Japanese American community struggling to maintain its
relevancy in an increasingly multiethnic world. The bank's investors
include Japanese American community leaders such as George Aratani,
founder of tableware maker Mikasa Inc. and stereo company Kenwood
Corp.; Frances Hashimoto, president of the Mikawaya bakery in Little
Tokyo; Dale Okuno, founder of E-Z Data Inc., a Pasadena technology
firm; and Tom Iino, a partner at Deloitte &amp; Touche.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very big on cultural preservation, particularly with the
generations going forward, the sansei [third generation] and yonsei
[fourth generation]," said Iino, whose father, Sho Iino, was the
first Japanese American accountant certified in California. "If this
bank is successful, it will be an entity the community feels good
about and perhaps will stimulate some thinking about the future of
Little Tokyo."</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese American community's challenge can be seen in the
numbers. Though Asian Americans are the fastest-growing minority
group in this country, there are few newcomers coming to the United
States from Japan. Many of the first- and second-generation Japanese
American immigrants have passed away, and their children and
grandchildren have assimilated into mainstream society.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, Japanese dropped from the third-most-represented Asian
ethnicity in 1990 to the sixth in the 2000 census. About 250,000
Japanese Americans and 54,500 Japanese citizens live in Southern
California, according to the Japanese Consulate in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The Japanese American community is dispersed and shrinking," said
Henry Ota, a prominent Los Angeles attorney who helped Kasamatsu
launch the bank. "The challenge for the Japanese American National
Museum, the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center and the
bank is to build a strong enough foundation today to allow us to be
successful in the broader community tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wartime Loss</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese American community lost much of its wealth during
World War II, when 120,000 men, women and children -- most of them
U.S. citizens -- were uprooted from the West Coast and sent to
internment camps. When the internees returned to California after the
war, there were no Japanese American businesses to serve them, so
they banked at the Japanese-owned banks that had branches in major
U.S. cities.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, several small financial institutions were started
by Japanese Americans. The best-known was Merit Savings Bank, which
was launched in 1962 and nearly sank under bad real estate loans
before it was acquired by the now-defunct Charter Savings Bank in
1988. In 1995, state regulators closed Torrance-based Pacific
Heritage Bank, a 15-year-old institution serving primarily Japanese
American customers, after it ran into debt problems.</TE>
<TE>   Bank mergers or acquisitions often create specialized niches that
small community banks can capitalize on, according to James Jones, an
executive vice president at Carpenter &amp; Co., an Irvine investment
bank specializing in financial services. Jones, who served as an
advisor to Pacific Commerce, said the bank's biggest challenges will
be reaching Japanese American customers scattered across Southern
California and expanding to other communities downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue for the bank will be to generate the loan demand that
will allow them to grow and develop the deposit relationships to
balance that loan growth," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   The bank's goal is to have $40 million in assets and $35 million
in deposits in its first year of operation.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Bank's top priority is Little Tokyo, which was a thriving
commercial center for the nation's largest Japanese community in the
1920s. As the community began to disperse, the neighborhood became a
retail center aimed at Japanese tourists and a home for the major
Japanese American cultural establishments. Spillover from the Toy
District and Chinatown has brought more ethnic diversity to the area,
which is why Kasamatsu hopes to add a Spanish-speaking staffer.</TE>
<TE>   To give Little Tokyo's small-business owners a better shot at
financing, Kasamatsu said, he will evaluate credit applications
individually rather than using the credit scoring system commonly
used by large banks.</TE>
<TE>   "There is $800 million in deposits in this area," he said,
referring to Little Tokyo. "If we can get 10% of that, we will be
successful."</TE>

<HD>Long Lines at the Ports Are Gone</HD>
<DH>Turnaround times for container ships have returned to
normal after delays, but the reason is fewer vessels are arriving,
officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turnaround times for container ships at the largest ports on the West
Coast have returned to normal after a month of costly congestion and
delays, according to official monitors.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 200 of the enormous transpacific vessels were stranded
outside ports from San Diego to Seattle during a 10-day employer
lockout, which was ended by a federal injunction Oct. 9. At the time,
industry experts estimated it would take at least six weeks to
whittle down the backlog.</LD>
<LD>   However, officials in the sprawling ports of Los Angeles-Long
Beach and Puget Sound, which includes Seattle and Tacoma, Wash., said
as of this weekend, the long lines were gone. "We're now declaring
ourselves at the high end of normal," said Dick McKenna of the Los
Angeles-Long Beach Marine Exchange, an industry cooperative that
monitors ship movements.</LD>
<TE>   "That's the good news," he said. "The bad news is it's only
because our ship counts are way down." Typically the two ports
receive about eight container ships a day, but in recent weeks, the
average has been only about 3 1/2, he said.</TE>
<TE>   It is probable that the drop is temporary, and that traffic will
return to typical levels in coming weeks as shipping lines resume
normal rotations, McKenna added.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Exchange at Puget Sound, the coast's other major
commercial shipping complex, declared this weekend that "vessel
scheduling has returned to normal." The group planned to discontinue
a daily Web site update on the backup as of today.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the situation at sea, some terminal yards still are
jammed with containers and suffering from equipment and labor
shortages, which are causing delays in moving the cargo to customers,
according to representatives of the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union and the trucking industry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely improving," union spokesman Steve Stallone said.
"But it will be a couple more weeks before things are really cleared
up."</TE>
<TE>   The development comes as the union and the Pacific Maritime Assn.
trade blame for the slow pace of recovery. The Justice Department is
weighing evidence submitted by both sides, and might ask a federal
court to issue further orders regarding the pace of work.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a federal mediator has called both sides back to the
bargaining table Wednesday after a weeklong break from negotiations.
A tentative agreement was reached this month on the sticky issue of
labor-saving technology, but pension, wages and the union's
arbitration system remain areas of contention.</TE>
<TE>   The union represents 10,500 dockworkers, who handle about $300
billion in merchandise moving through the ports each year.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, is scheduled to meet today with
a federal panel administering the airline industry loan-guarantee
program.</LD>
<LD>   The struggling airline needs to secure $1.8 billion in loan
guarantees from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board to help
stave off a bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   To get the support, the second-biggest carrier needs to show the
board that it is aggressively cutting costs. One way UAL can do that
is to show that its labor unions are willing to make concessions.</LD>
<TE>   Over the weekend, United's flight attendants union agreed to a
$412-million wage cut over 5 1/2 years, becoming the second major
union to reach a tentative cost-cutting deal. Pilots recently began
voting on their own $2.2-billion wage-cut package over the same
period, and smaller unions also have cut deals.</TE>
<TE>   The International Assn. of Machinists has not yet agreed to the
concessions, which were broadly outlined at a total of $5.8 billion
in wage cuts by a five-member coalition of United unions.</TE>

<HD>With Reforms, Japan Can Dig Out of Its Hole, U.S. Group
Says</HD>
<DH>The economic prognosis is not as dire as believed,
L.A.-based council contends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>TOKYO -- Over the last decade, Japan generated a steady stream of bad
economic, social and political news. Government, bank and corporate
debt ballooned and unemployment grew. Public wealth built up by
millions of hard-working Japanese was squandered by bureaucrats
intent on building more roads to nowhere. Companies employed more
"walking dead" -- workers with a paycheck but little to do.</LD>
<LD>   On other fronts, social anxiety over crime rose as critics fretted
that the family was imploding, that youngsters were losing their work
ethic and the social order was breaking down. And year after year, a
parade of mostly mediocre leaders greeted each new crisis with just
enough of a face-saving plan to muddle through.</LD>
<LD>   That's the conventional wisdom. But Japan is getting a bad rap,
says a report by the Los Angeles-based Pacific Council on
International Policy. The nation's image beyond its borders as a
second-tier power bent on driving itself further into the depths of
despair, stock market declines and stagnation is unfair, even
counterproductive, the report contends.</LD>
<TE>   The group ticks off a list of reasons the glass is half full.
Japan remains the world's second-largest economy and a major aid
donor. It has several world-class companies that are technological
leaders and household names abroad. It still is a major foreign
investor, has become more engaged in security issues and is
benefiting from younger generations that are more independent and
worldly. There's more foreign management and growing dynamism among
small companies.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt there are troubles," said Pete Wilson, the
group's task force leader and a former governor of California, at a
news conference in Tokyo. If reforms are carried out, "in five years
Japan will be restored to health and will be welcoming investment and
receiving it."</TE>
<TE>   Among the steps Japan needs to take to dig itself out of its hole,
the report adds, include creating more opportunities for women,
entrepreneurs, migrants and foreign investors, opening its economy
and dispelling the ghosts of protectionism.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most fundamentally, it must change the way decisions are
made and establish rules that are fair and transparent. At the center
of many of Japan's myriad problems is an archaic political system
that promotes the interests of senior bureaucrats, business leaders
and politicians intent on preserving the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   "Without political competition, you are guaranteed to have
corruption," Wilson said at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan
this month. "Far more important than corruption measured in terms of
scandals on the part of individual officeholders is a larger and more
fundamental corruption ... [namely] preventing reform that is so
clearly needed in this country for Japan to be all that it can be."</TE>
<TE>   The council's report -- entitled "Can Japan Come Back?" --
includes caveats in its scenario. Given how far Japan still seems to
be from the starting gate, a relatively quick turnaround may be
overly optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "Recovery in five years sounds a bit tough to me," said Kazuo
Ogawa, economics professor at Osaka University. "I would think it's
going to take eight to nine years."</TE>
<TE>   Just clearing up the load of bad debts -- which independent
analysts peg at about $1 trillion -- will take years, especially
given that a financial recovery plan announced last week had been
significantly weakened at the behest of old-guard politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Many domestic companies also are on the defensive after a decade
of tough times and still are in need of restructuring. And labor
markets are wobbly at best. For many analysts, these factors raise
the specter of another decade of drift before Japan regains traction.</TE>

<HD>Al Qaeda's Dangerous Metamorphosis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon</AU>
<BD>Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, both of whom served
on the National Security Council during the Clinton administration,
are co-authors of "The Age of Sacred Terror" (Random House, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Public opinion in the United States has underestimated the threat of
Al Qaeda and radical Islam on several key occasions. We are on the
verge of doing it again.</LD>
<LD>   Experts commenting on the Moscow hostage-taking have been quick to
remind us that the Chechen conflict predates the rise of Al Qaeda
and, as a local matter, should not be viewed as part of the group's
transnational agenda.</LD>
<LD>   The Bali attack has been interpreted as showing that the militants
have shifted to smaller and softer targets.</LD>
<TE>   Al Qaeda is said to have a weakened leadership, an inability to
overcome the local agendas of affiliated groups and a loss of its
capacity to carry out major operations.</TE>
<TE>   These conclusions may be more hopeful than accurate.</TE>
<TE>   Undoubtedly, eviction from its haven in Afghanistan has been a
setback for Al Qaeda. But we cannot overlook the historical breadth
of the group's agenda, its long-term involvement in regional
struggles and how its vision has been assimilated by others.</TE>
<TE>   From its beginnings, Osama bin Laden's group has supported
numerous far-flung Islamist groups and, before organizing its own
attacks against the United States, became the world's foremost
bankroller of jihadist terror.</TE>
<TE>   Its strategy has always held that the militant Islamists had to
seize a state to begin knocking down the dominoes of moderate Muslim
regimes. By training and underwriting others, Al Qaeda believed --
rightly -- that it would acquire like-minded allies around the world
who would join in the ultimate effort to create a theocratic Muslim
super-state.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, from the early 1990s, Chechens were trained in Afghanistan.
Money, men and weapons were funneled to the breakaway republic, and a
bond was formed between Bin Laden's organization and the most extreme
Chechen fighters.</TE>
<TE>   A Bin Laden associate named Khattab became a legendary figure in
the Chechen insurrection and, before he was killed earlier this year,
reportedly trained Movsar Barayev, the leader of the squad that took
over the Moscow theater.</TE>
<TE>   The ability of these extremists to shape events has been profound:
In 1999, a small band of jihadists began an insurrection in Dagestan
that spilled over into Chechnya, reigniting a war that Chechen
moderates had wanted to avoid. The Islamic extremists have given an
increasingly religious hue to the conflict, much as Al Qaeda-trained
operatives fighting in Kashmir have done there.</TE>
<TE>   The Moscow operation combined the Chechen tradition of
hostage-taking with Al Qaeda practices, such as the emphasis on
martyrdom and an effort to create the greatest possible spectacle,
something Barayev's predecessors avoided.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda trainees also helped create Jemaah Islamiah, a jihadist
group that seeks to found an Islamic state out of parts of several
Pacific Rim countries. It was a week from carrying out a major attack
in Singapore in January when American investigators discovered
documents and surveillance videos at an abandoned Al Qaeda safe house
in Afghanistan. The conspiracy aimed at destroying the U.S., British
and Australian embassies as well as American warships.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing in Bali, which claimed nearly 200 lives -- a massive
strike by all standards short of Sept. 11 -- fit into both Jemaah
Islamiah's local agenda and Al Qaeda's broader one. It was an attack
on the Jakarta government, roiling the politics between
fundamentalist Muslims and moderates, exposing the country's poor
security arrangements and destroying the tourist trade.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts who focus on the economic aspect of the target miss
the religious nature of the war being waged by the radical Islamists.
Jemaah Islamiah was advancing Al Qaeda's global aims through the mass
killing of Westerners, who they believe are all accomplices in
America's crusade to destroy Islam.</TE>
<TE>   The dangerous conclusion that has been drawn from the recent
attacks is that Al Qaeda is shying away from the increasingly
hardened targets of the United States. To mistake Al Qaeda's
continued pursuit of its long-term strategy elsewhere for a sign that
it has suspended efforts to attack Americans is not only illogical
but downright delusional. The group has always shown great patience;
that such an attack has not materialized for 14 months gives us no
reassurance.</TE>
<TE>   Top Al Qaeda operatives are still in circulation, and thousands of
veterans of the training camps are spread around the world. With
laptops, encrypted communications and multiple passports, the
terrorists can coordinate attacks in many "fields of the jihad."</TE>
<TE>   As it metamorphoses into a virtual network, depriving its enemies
of a geographic target, Al Qaeda may become a greater threat than it
was before its leadership melted away at Tora Bora.</TE>

<HD>No to a Far-Right Court: Use Filibusters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Erwin Chemerinsky and Catherine Fisk</AU>
<BD>Erwin Chemerinsky and Catherine Fisk are visiting
professors at Duke Law School.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Republicans in control of the Senate, President Bush will try to
fill the federal courts with judges from the far right. He has long
made it clear that he wants to appoint conservative judges in the
mold of Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.</LD>
<LD>   For the last two years, the Democrats have blocked the president's
most conservative nominees in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Now
that the Republicans have captured the Senate, the Democrats no
longer control the committee. They have only one way to check the
president's ability to pack the federal courts and they must use it:
the filibuster.</LD>
<LD>   There is ample precedent for filibusters of presidential
nominations to executive and judicial positions. In fact, Republicans
frequently used them during Democratic administrations.</LD>
<TE>   During the Clinton presidency, Republicans successfully
filibustered and blocked the nomination of Henry Foster for surgeon
general.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, South Carolina's Sen. Strom Thurmond filibustered to stop
the confirmation of Justice Abe Fortas to replace Chief Justice Earl
Warren and Judge Homer Thornberry to succeed Fortas.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic senators must use the filibuster now to block the most
conservative of President Bush's judicial nominees for the lower
federal courts. Also, it is likely that a justice or two may resign
from the Supreme Court during the remainder of the Bush presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats must use the filibuster, and the threat of the
filibuster, to ensure that a new justice is not a conservative from
the same school as Scalia and Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   An enormous amount is at stake in the judicial confirmation
process. A change in two votes on the Supreme Court could mean the
overruling of Roe vs. Wade and a woman's right to reproductive
choice. In the years ahead, federal courts will be deciding crucial
questions concerning the federal government's power to provide
remedies for civil rights violations, including employment
discrimination based on race and gender.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the federal courts are the essential and only check against
excessive government interference with individual rights in the name
of the war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in every area of personal freedom, from freedom of speech
to privacy, American law and policy will depend on the composition of
the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Supreme Court decides only about 75 cases a year, and
hears fewer than 2% of the cases in which review is requested, who
sits on the federal Court of Appeals is crucial.</TE>
<TE>   During the Clinton presidency, one of us was informed by the White
House counsel's office that he was being considered for an
appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Ultimately, he was told
that he could not be appointed because it was thought that his public
support for affirmative action and reproductive freedom made him too
liberal to be confirmed by a Republican-controlled Senate.</TE>
<TE>   If outspoken liberals were unacceptable judicial nominees during
the Clinton administration, then extreme conservatives are equally
unsuitable now.</TE>
<TE>   Courageous Democrats in the Senate must announce their intent to
use the filibuster to prevent a conservative takeover of the federal
courts that could last long beyond our lifetimes.</TE>

<HD>There Shouldn't Be a Remote Control on How We Watch DVDs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ernest Miller</AU>
<BD>Ernest Miller is a fellow of the Information Society
Project at Yale Law School and the lead editor for LawMeme (www.law
meme.org), the school's Web log on technology law and policy.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What would you think if you had to get permission from the architect
before you could have your house painted another color? How would you
feel if the photographer had to agree with your selection of a frame
for a favorite photograph? What if the director of a movie could
decide when it was OK for you to fast-forward through a DVD you had
rented?</LD>
<LD>   Sounds crazy? The last example is now the crux of a lawsuit
brought by the Directors Guild of America against a number of
companies that make DVD-playing software.</LD>
<LD>   What has the DGA up in arms is the emergence of new technology
that controls the playback of DVDs so that they can be enhanced with
additional material, such as audio commentary by a film historian, or
allows parents to filter out content they feel is inappropriate for
their children.</LD>
<TE>   In the words of DGA President Martha Coolidge: "They are taking
films and using technology to alter them without permission from
either their directors or their copyright holders."</TE>
<TE>   But Coolidge's argument doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Unlike the
technology with CleanFlicks, which permanently alters the videotape,
technology from companies such as ClearPlay, Movie Mask and Family
Shield requires the viewer to have a legitimately purchased or rented
DVD. The home viewer then plays the movie while simultaneously
running the software, which instructs the DVD player when, where and
for how long to skip specific visuals or mute selected audio in the
film.</TE>
<TE>   The software does not -- nor can it -- alter a single second of
the rented or purchased disc. It only alters the playback of that
DVD. Rented disks get returned in exactly the same condition as when
customers received them.</TE>
<TE>   What the DGA is claiming is not the right to prevent alteration of
a work, but the right to control how an individual watches a DVD in
the privacy of his or her own home. What the DGA is saying is that
you either watch a film its way or not at all. What the DGA wants to
take away is consumer choice.</TE>
<TE>   The DGA argues that consumers already have a choice: They can
choose whether to buy or rent a film. But directors also have a
choice. If they don't want people to watch movies in ways they don't
approve, they don't have to sell or rent DVDs to the public.
Directors should have a right to control what they release to the
public. But the directors' right to control content ends once they
sell the DVD.</TE>
<TE>   When you buy a book you can highlight portions or rearrange pages.
A friend can recommend that you rip out the boring chapters and read
only the climax, and neither the author nor the publisher has a right
to stop you. Why should movies on DVD be any different?</TE>
<TE>   When a DVD is legitimately purchased or rented, consumers should
have the right to play it with software that enhances their personal
viewing experience. Parents should have the right to skip a second or
two of gratuitous nudity in an otherwise family-friendly film. Film
buffs should have the right to watch a film with an alternative audio
commentary by an expert such as Roger Ebert, without permanently
altering the disc.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the issue is one of control. Technology has given
consumers the ability to control how they watch movies in their
homes, and the DGA wants to take that control away by banning the
technology. Even if you don't have kids, aren't much of a film buff
or love graphic movies, do you really want Hollywood dictating how
you view DVDs in your own home?</TE>

<HD>Egyptian TV Fuels Hate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Egyptian television audiences are at their peak for the next few
weeks as families end the daily fast of Ramadan by eating lavish,
hours-long meals in front of TV sets.</LD>
<LD>   In this ultra-prime viewing time, Egyptian state television has
begun a 41-part series called "Horseman Without a Horse," based on
vicious lies about the birth of the Zionist movement.</LD>
<LD>   The show -- inspired by the fraudulent conspiracy tract, "The
Protocols of the Elders of Zion," that inspired Adolf Hitler --
serves as a madrasa, or religious school, in fanaticism for the
masses.</LD>
<TE>   Given that there is no truly independent press in Egypt, the
government can hardly maintain that it is protecting free-speech
rights. Instead, Egyptian officials claim that such shows simply
express hostility toward Israeli policies toward the Palestinians
rather than hatred of Jews generally.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt, which receives nearly $2 billion a year in aid from the
U.S., has every right to publish and air harsh criticisms of Israel,
but it undermines its case by regularly printing and broadcasting
explicitly anti-Semitic material.</TE>
<TE>   "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," for example, purports to be
a secret plan by a small group of Jews plotting to take over the
world. Mohammad Sobhi, the hero of "Horseman Without a Horse," has
the mission of discovering whether the protocols are true, even
though they have been thoroughly discredited by historians as a 1905
forgery by the Russian czar's secret police.</TE>
<TE>   The series depicts the creation of Israel in 1948 as the result of
devious plotting. "The armies of the free have been defeated by
treachery," Sobhi declares. But the truth is that Arab countries
attacked Israel, not the reverse.</TE>
<TE>   In questioning Israel's right to exist, the series flouts the
spirit of the 1978 Camp David accords that established peace between
Israel and Egypt. It also strengthens the case of nationalist
Israelis who seize on such propaganda to declare that real peace will
never be possible with any Arab country.</TE>
<TE>   In sponsoring virulent anti-Semitism, Egypt, like Saudi Arabia, is
playing a double game, hoping that such shows will serve as a safety
valve for restive populations to let off anger about Jews and the
West.</TE>
<TE>   But after 9/11, the danger of encouraging perceptions of Jewish
cunning -- and rage about the power of the West -- is all too clear.
Egypt, which regards itself as the center of the Arab intellectual
world, can only be perceived in this instance as actively promoting
ignorance and hatred.</TE>

by Enron's implosion. So do Enron business partners and competitors
burned by the corporate scandal, not to mention public policy makers
and historians. Journalists too would benefit from studying the
estimated 20 million pages of documents that a shareholder lawsuit is
expected to generate.</LD>
<LD>   The paper trail would provide needed insight into how the
fifth-largest company on the Fortune 500 tumbled into the
second-largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history. It's a tale
bound to be as compelling and surreal as Alice's journey. But it
won't be told if Enron executives get their way and a U.S. district
judge in Houston agrees to keep the company's documents under lock.</LD>
<TE>   Enron insiders profited from the secrecy that shrouded their
actions from shareholders and regulators. The resulting scandal
sparked an unprecedented crisis of confidence in public financial
markets. Now it's time for Enron's past business dealings to be
exposed. It's anyone's guess as to what will be uncovered -- perhaps
a hookah-smoking accountant ginning up false profits?</TE>
<TE>   Investors, with support from several media organizations, are
asking the federal judge to permit shareholders' attorneys to release
many of the Enron documents to the public. The University of
California, which lost $144.9 million on Enron investments, is acting
as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit filed by investors who together lost
more than $25 billion in Enron stocks and bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Investors want the court to let their attorneys determine which
documents are open to public scrutiny. The exceptions would be
information that a judge agrees Enron has a right to keep private for
narrow proprietary or confidentiality reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Enron is lobbying to have all the documents dumped into a
windowless vault. Plaintiffs would be forced to argue for the release
of individual pieces of paper. Even curiouser, the company argues
that disseminating documents would subject defendants "to further
annoyance, embarrassment and oppression" -- even though many of these
documents already have been released to government agencies delving
into Enron's meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's penchant for secrecy has already burned the public badly.
The judge should side with investors, the public, policymakers and
others who would benefit from bringing Enron's inner workings to
light.</TE>

<HD>A Loud 'Yes' on Health Care</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Do ordinary people want action on the health-care problems that
politicians love to ignore? Resoundingly yes, if the vote for a tax
increase to bolster Los Angeles County's trauma-care system is any
measure.</LD>
<LD>   For years, the future of the stretched-to-the-limit county
health-care system has been up in the air, its problems punted from
county supervisors to the governor to Washington. Finally the
supervisors, fearing that the health system's mounting deficits would
drive the county into bankruptcy, did something most politicians no
longer do: They asked for a property tax increase.</LD>
<LD>   County residents approved it with a 73% "yes" vote, an unheard-of
margin. The 3-cent-a-square-foot tax is the first direct property tax
increase to pass since 1978's tax-slashing Proposition 13. The money
will be used to keep countywide trauma centers and emergency
departments open and to ready the county to counter any bioterrorism
attack.</LD>
<TE>   Voters care about health care. Politicians should too. There is
plenty left to do. The root of Los Angeles' still-staggering
financial crisis is the number of people the county serves who have
no health insurance and can't afford to pay for care.</TE>
<TE>   The uninsured are not confined to Los Angeles County, although
their numbers are greater here due to a swelling immigrant
population, high poverty rates and a concentration of small-company
and service-industry jobs that don't offer insurance. California has
the lowest rate of employer-sponsored insurance in the country,
according to a 2002 Urban Institute report, but comes in second to
President Bush's home state of Texas in the overall uninsured rate,
which takes into account both employer- and government-sponsored
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, 40 million Americans lack any kind of coverage, public
or private.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance crisis is not something that counties, the most
cash-strapped of governments, can solve by themselves. The Bush
administration's health honcho, Tom Scully, is at least talking with
county and state officials. But during his visit last week to
county-run Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, he merely urged supervisors to
"come up with a responsible fix"; he rejected their plan, one that
already has led to clinic closings and other painful cutbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis declined to even talk with the county until
shortly before the election, when he promised help and hinted at a
special legislative session.</TE>
<TE>   Davis could start with a commitment to up the state's contribution
-- among the lowest of such payments in the nation -- to Medi-Cal,
the state version of the low- income Medicaid program, which would
trigger additional matching federal money. Medi-Cal payments will no
doubt be held in temporary thrall to the state's budget problem, but
they have to be on the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   If a humbled governor who got only 47% of the statewide vote is
looking for a mandate, he will find it in health care.</TE>

<HD>Democratic Leadership Lost Touch With Reality</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Gephardt to Leave Leadership Post," Nov. 7: That Sen. Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) and Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) are still considering
running for the presidency further proves just how far out of touch
with reality their leadership in the Senate and House has been. Do
they seriously think that, with the outcome of the Nov. 5 elections,
any Democrat would ever vote for them? This one sure wouldn't.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Emery</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I interpret Gephardt's resignation as a sign of failed leadership.
As the House minority leader, he failed (in what would have appeared
to be ideal conditions) to rally the troops and their constituents to
further populate his domain. Republicans will, or should, use his
incompetence as evidence against him in any potential presidential
bid. After all, if he can't lead his party in the House, how can he
possibly lead the United States?</TE>
<TE>   Don Danielson</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The election proves that when given a choice between a Republican
and a "Dempublican," the voters will choose the Republican. It's time
that the Democrats grow a spine and find something to stand for.
Otherwise, the party is destined to go the way of the dodo. I'm sure
the Green Party will be happy to take its place, but with values.</TE>

<TE>   Your headline, "Unite Us, Mr. President" (editorial, Nov. 7), is a
bit cheeky, isn't it? Why not just accept the election results and
use, "You Won, Mr. President. We support you!"</TE>
<TE>   Dick Ettington</TE>
<TE>   Palos Verdes</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Try as they might, Republicans cannot convince anyone but
themselves that this election represented President Bush's victory
over Bill Clinton (letter, Nov. 8). Bush could never have competed
with Clinton in intellect, charisma or political savvy. A political
heavyweight has been replaced by a shadow-boxing lightweight who
dominates the ring mainly because of a lack of credible opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Trendall</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Democrats are now scrambling to figure out what happened last
Tuesday. Either they don't get it or they can't face it.</TE>
<TE>   It's really quite simple -- the American people like Bush. And
why? He has a viable agenda, he has a positive attitude, he is
ethical and he is likable. The Democrats, on the other hand, have no
agenda; they have an incredibly negative, hostile attitude; their
past ethics are highly questionable, and they present themselves as
genuinely unlikable.</TE>
<TE>   Marianne Truitt</TE>
<TE>   Marina del Rey</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Do those who supported the Republicans appreciate that any vote
for a Republican candidate was a vote against desperately needed
health-care reform? Let's hope they remember that fact the next time
they complain about the spiraling costs of medication and coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Garcia</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who would have thought that invading Iraq, turning surpluses into
deficits, drilling for more oil as a sole energy policy and winking
at corporate crime could look so good to so many people? That the
Democrats couldn't offer more attractive alternatives is truly
pathetic.</TE>

<LD>I, along with millions of Americans, received the new 2003 pamphlets
from our HMO carriers in these last few weeks. Of course, the
election has placed it on the back burner for a time, and I know that
many Americans have not reviewed their pamphlet to see what the many
changes are or just how high the horrific increases will be in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Some retired Americans will have to make the decision whether to
buy groceries or pay for their chemotherapy treatments. I have a
friend who will have to pay more than $525 every three months for
medication that she needs to stay alive. When she found out about
this she sat down and cried. I have another friend who is being
questioned about a new medication that she had been given; the HMO
says it is "unclassified" for bone cancer. This medication prevents
her from having to enter a hospital for two or three pints of blood
every few weeks. Yet the HMO does not take this cost into
consideration when disallowing a newer medication.</LD>
<LD>   I wish I had the billions that the U.S. has spent on all of these
elections. I know where it could be better spent. No, I don't know
why the system has failed the American people. We give, give and give
trillions of dollars to everyone until we are now taxed to the limit.
Now we can plan to die because we can't afford to live!</LD>

<LD>Re "Quench Fires of Hatred to Protect Diplomats" (letter, Nov. 1): I
agree in principle that the U.S.' foreign policy places American
citizens traveling abroad in peril, but a broader issue must be
addressed. The terrorist bombing in Bali killed people of many
nationalities, mostly Australians. Our self-serving foreign policy
places everyone at risk -- not just Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Until all nations abandon limited national self-interest in favor
of global cooperation, the problems for all citizens of the world
will remain. I see a lot of "God Bless America" stickers these days,
and that kind of patriotism is wonderful. How about "God Bless Our
Planet"?</LD>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis should not consider his reelection results a mandate
to turn further to the right but a warning shot fired from the left.
If Davis wants to leave a legacy in the governor's office, he will
remember the number of voters who, like me, went Green for the first
time ever this year.</LD>
<LD>   Year 2006 need not be the "Year of Arnold's Ascendancy" (if Arnold
Schwarzenegger runs for governor). It should be the time for a
governor who truly governs for the majority of Californians.</LD>

you want the Republicans to enable the Democrats' "spendaholism."</TE>

<LD>The best postelection article was "Looking to History, Pundits Never
Saw This One Coming" (Nov. 7), on the failures of polling in this
election. I've always wondered why we bothered to hold elections if
the polling was so accurate. Think of the money we could save!</LD>
<LD>   I'm also fascinated to discover a good side to the annoying
dinnertime telephone calls of the telemarketers: They've succeeded in
making us respondents cranky and less likely to talk to pollsters.
Imagine, we might have to wait to find out who really won an election
when they count the votes. Will TV news ever recover? Film at 11.</LD>

<LD>To the naive, left-wing fools who assert that in destroying an Al
Qaeda van filled with terrorists and explosives the U.S. is somehow
at fault (letters, Nov. 7), I say this: What did you want the U.S. to
do, read them their Miranda rights? These murderers have been
emboldened by our lack of response in the past and have no respect
for international law or any other kind of law. When you're in a
street fight and someone is kneeing you in the groin, you respond in
kind.</LD>
<LD>   When the next terrorist attack is perpetrated against this
country, these same people will complain that the intelligence
agencies haven't been doing their job. So the CIA whacks a key Bin
Laden lieutenant on his way to murder innocent people and they cry
that President Bush is a terrorist. Gimme a break.</LD>
<LD>   Funny how The Times consistently prints these sorts of ridiculous
letters, yet the average person on the street seems delighted by the
fact that we're striking back.</LD>

<HD>Ramadan: Egyptians Send a Mixed Message</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Lamb's "A Holy Month Brings Comfort to Worried Muslims in
Mideast" (Nov. 6) describes the strictness with which the Egyptian
soldiers observed the fast of Ramadan, so that even in wartime, in
1973, they were hesitant to eat. They had too much respect for their
religion to eat. When did this Egyptian attack on Israel take place?
On Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year in Judaism, because they
benefited by choosing this day.</LD>
<LD>   When Muslims have respect for religions other than their own,
their worldview will change quite dramatically. It's an interesting
irony, isn't it? You refer to the "war against Israel in 1973" -- and
that's true, it did take place in 1973. But history books call it the
Yom Kippur War for a reason.</LD>
<LD>   Faith Schames</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lamb writes from Cairo about the holy month of Ramadan, a time for
Muslims to "renew one's commitment to God through prayer, charitable
deeds and abstinence." To commemorate this sacred time, Egyptian
state TV will be airing a series based on the vehemently anti-Semitic
canard, "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion."</TE>
<TE>   This inflammatory production serves no purpose other than to
spread hatred and lies and demonize the Jewish people and the state
of Israel. Shame on Egypt for brainwashing its people during their
holiest month of the year.</TE>

<LD>Re "Eye in the Sky Keeps Watch on Coast," Nov. 6: Hooray for Kenneth
and Gabrielle Adelman! How very refreshing to see capable and
successful entrepreneurs spending their money on valuable
public-interest issues rather than self-indulgent purchases of
"extra" cars, houses and other such ridiculous paraphernalia. Perhaps
this effort signs a return to some positive values. May many follow
in their footsteps.</LD>

<HD>William Kaplan, 88; Neurogeneticist at City of Hope Studied
Mutations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William D. Kaplan, the first neurogeneticist at City of Hope Medical
Center and an expert on the consequences of mutations on behavior and
aging, has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Kaplan died Wednesday in Arcadia of heart failure.</LD>
<LD>   He joined the Duarte center for research and treatment of cancer
and other potentially fatal diseases in 1953 and became chairman of
its genetics department in 1958. Active to the end of his life,
Kaplan continued his research in the molecular cloning laboratory at
the City of Hope's Beckman Research Institute until 1996.</LD>
<TE>   Kaplan specialized in the isolation and study of the Shaker class
of mutants of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. He studied the
nature of the mutations, their interactions and their effects on
behavior and aging. His work aided the understanding of how genes
contribute to neurological diseases.</TE>
<TE>   After earning his doctorate in zoology at UC Berkeley, Kaplan was
a fellow of the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In 1954, shortly after he began his work at City of Hope, he was
awarded a U.S. Public Health Service research fellowship there to
study origins of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   He served in the Army in Europe during World War II, rising to the
rank of major in the chemical warfare unit.</TE>
<TE>   A widower, Kaplan is survived by his son, David, of Carlsbad,
Calif.; a daughter, Sara, of Castro Valley, Calif.; a brother,
Frederick, of East Lansing, Mich.; and a grandchild.</TE>
<TE>   The family has requested that, instead of flowers, memorial
contributions be made to the Beckman Research Institute at City of
Hope in Duarte.</TE>

<HD>Mabel C. Harris, 84; Taught Public How to Prepare Food,
Menus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mabel C. Harris, who made strides for women in the executive ranks of
Vons Grocery Stores and other companies as a home economist, has
died. She was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Harris died Saturday in Glendale of heart failure, said her niece,
Lanore Galvin of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   In 1960, Vons hired and publicized Harris as "the first graduate
home economist to join a supermarket chain staff." Her duties were to
"help the public with recipes, menus and buying information."</LD>
<TE>   In an era before grocery stores were stocked with prepared and
semi-prepared meals, Harris met with women's groups, spoke at schools
and supermarket openings, provided tips and recipes on radio and
television, and made other appearances to teach the public about food
preparation. She pledged to "help women get more fun and less work
out of good menus and meals."</TE>
<TE>   A rarity among executive ranks four decades ago, Harris was the
only woman pictured and listed in the Vons executive directory of
1964 and for several years afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Even in retirement, she prodded the male-governed food chain to
recognize the wisdom of having women help run supermarkets. At a
stockholders' meeting in 1989, the retired Harris, a stockholder,
rose to speak. After saying several kind things about her longtime
employer, she chided the board:</TE>
<TE>   "All of you directors are men. It seems to me you ought to have a
woman director. And I'm available."</TE>
<TE>   She was not added to the board.</TE>
<TE>   In the several decades she was associated with Vons, Harris was
never known by her name. She was introduced at events, listed in
directories and identified in news media as Virginia O'Neal, whose
initials, conveniently, spelled the monogram VON.</TE>
<TE>   Harris grew up on a Montana cattle ranch learning home economics
by doing it. She canned her way to college by preserving 4,000 quarts
of vegetables. The feat earned her top prize in a national 4-H
contest -- a four-year scholarship from the Kerr Glass Co., which
made glass jars used by homemakers for preserving food.</TE>
<TE>   After earning her home economics degree at Montana State
University, Harris went to work for Kerr, driving to her lectures on
food preservation in a company car with a rendering of a Kerr glass
canning jar mounted on the trunk.</TE>
<TE>   Harris moved on to Swift and Co., where, as a home economist
called Martha Logan, she spoke to more than 25,000 homemakers a year.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, she moved to California to work for the California
Dairy Council, still instructing consumers in handling food.</TE>
<TE>   Well-regarded by her peers, Harris was twice elected president of
the Home Economists in Business and was active in the American Home
Economist Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Harris judged food entries at the Los Angeles County Fair for more
than 40 years. She was also a judge for the Pillsbury Bake-Off, a
national contest.</TE>
<TE>   Widowed by the death of her husband of 50 years, Basil G. Harris,
she is survived by a stepson, Jerry Harris of Carmichael, Calif., and
a sister, Nellie Barker of Helena, Mont.</TE>

<HD>Lawrence Rainey, 79; Sheriff Was Tried in '64 Civil Rights

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MERIDIAN, Miss.</DL>
<LD>Lawrence Andrew Rainey Sr., the sheriff whose acquittal in the
slayings of three civil rights workers was chronicled in the 1988
movie "Mississippi Burning," has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   His wife, Juanita, said he died Friday of throat cancer.</LD>
<LD>   As Neshoba County sheriff, Rainey was charged with civil rights
violations for allegedly conspiring to kill James Earl Chaney, Andrew
Goodman and Michael Schwerner in 1964 during Mississippi's turbulent
"Freedom Summer," when hundreds of volunteers scoured the state to
register black voters.</LD>
<TE>   The three disappeared when they went to investigate a fire at a
church in Neshoba County. Their bodies were found buried in an
earthen dam a few miles from the church. They had been shot and
beaten.</TE>
<TE>   Seven Ku Klux Klansmen, including Chief Deputy Cecil Price, were
convicted of federal civil rights violations in the deaths and
sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to 10 years. Rainey was
acquitted. The state never brought murder charges, and none of those
convicted served more than six years.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi Atty. Gen. Mike Moore and Neshoba County Dist. Atty.
Ken Turner have been trying to build a case against an undisclosed
number of suspects, some with ties to the Ku Klux Klan.</TE>
<TE>   Rainey was sheriff from 1963 until 1967.</TE>

<HD>Ehud Sprinzak, 62; Expert on Israel's Right-Wingers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Ehud Sprinzak, an Israeli counterterrorism specialist and expert in
far-right Jewish groups, died Friday of cancer at a hospital near Tel
Aviv. He was 62.</LD>
<LD>   Sprinzak, a political science professor, was one of the few
experts on Israel's ultra-right who had told then-Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin that he might face an assassination attempt.</LD>
<LD>   "He was one of the leading people who had warned ... Rabin there
could be a lone wolf assassin," said Galia Golan, a colleague. Rabin
was gunned down after a peace rally in November 1995 by an extremist
Israeli who opposed his policy of compromise with the Palestinians.</LD>
<TE>   Sprinzak was a senior lecturer of political science at Jerusalem's
Hebrew University until he founded the Lauder School for Government
Studies at Israel's International Policy Institute of
Counterterrorism about a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He combined two things ... a bright lecturer who was greatly
loved by his students and an excellent researcher," said Boaz Ganor,
the institute's director.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sprinzak researched their activities, he was respected
and liked among Israeli right-wingers, who considered him a
professional who did not allow his political opinions to influence
his research, Ganor said.</TE>
<TE>   The author of five books, Sprinzak was often interviewed by media
from outside Israel, including the New York Times, Washington Post
and Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Sprinzak received a doctorate in political science from Yale
University, and had been a visiting professor at several U.S.
universities.</TE>
<TE>   Sprinzak is survived by his wife, Ricki; four children; and two
grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>After talking about an aggressive new round of tax cuts, Republicans
are hoping to press forward next year with a modest tax agenda that's
probably more symbolic than substantive, GOP congressional sources
say.</LD>
<LD>   The tax cut strategy will be twofold: a largely political push to
make last year's 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut permanent; and an
immediate "stimulus" package tied to economic recovery that could
include a doubling of the child credit, raising limits on
contributions to retirement accounts and more tax breaks for business
investment.</LD>

<HD>New Energy in Congress Over Homeland Security Bill</HD>
<DH>Fresh momentum for creating the Cabinet agency shows
President Bush's enhanced clout after elections gave GOP control of
both houses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson and Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congress and President Bush are nearing a breakthrough on
long-stalled legislation to create a new Cabinet department for
domestic security, top Republican and Democratic lawmakers said
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The fresh momentum for a Department of Homeland Security reflects
Bush's enhanced clout after last week's elections gave Republicans
control of both houses of Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The homeland security bill has languished in the Democrat-led
Senate for months as the two parties fought over the degree of
authority the proposed department's management would have to confront
labor unions and shake up civil service rules. Republicans sided with
management -- that is, Bush -- and Democrats with the unions.</LD>
<TE>   Now the legislation has new life, and probably on terms closer to
Bush's liking. The White House and senior lawmakers worked through
the weekend on a compromise. If enacted, the bill to create the
third-largest Cabinet department would be the centerpiece of a
lame-duck session of the 107th Congress set to begin Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said Sunday
that a deal on homeland security could come this week. "We're very
close," he said on NBC's "Meet the Press."</TE>
<TE>   "We hope by Tuesday or Wednesday we would have a bill that could
be passed by the Senate by a wide margin."</TE>
<TE>   Lott, who will be majority leader when the 108th Congress begins
in January, could take over that position from Sen. Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) as early as Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle, appearing with Lott on "Meet the Press," also indicated
that the bill is likely to move. He said Republicans had filibustered
to block the bill before the election in a political calculation to
win votes. One Republican candidate, Rep. Saxby Chambliss, won a
Senate election in Georgia after attacking the Democratic incumbent,
Max Cleland, for failing to back Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we've got to get the job done," Daschle said. "Now the games
should be over."</TE>
<TE>   No details about the negotiations were available.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, also told NBC:
"They've got to pass that homeland security bill. We'd like to see it
done. I think it can happen."</TE>
<TE>   But homeland security is far from the only matter before the
lame-duck Congress. There is a backlog of unfinished business --
including a handful of other terrorism-related bills, 11 spending
bills for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 and more than 80 judicial
and executive nominations.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate also faces an immediate question: Who's in charge?</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's midterm elections gave Republicans a majority of at
least 228 seats in the 435-member House and at least 51 seats in the
100-member Senate -- with a Senate race in Louisiana to be settled in
a Dec. 7 runoff and a handful of outcomes in the House uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   But those GOP majorities will not be in place until January. It's
unclear who will run the Senate when the lame-duck session begins.
That's because an interim senator from Minnesota, independent Dean
Barkley, will be sworn in Tuesday to fill out the term of Democratic
Sen. Paul Wellstone, who died in a plane crash last month.</TE>
<TE>   Barkley's arrival gives the lame-duck Senate 49 Republicans, 49
Democrats and two independents. The other independent, James M.
Jeffords of Vermont, votes with Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Barkley has not decided whether to side with the Republicans or
the Democrats or to remain neutral, his spokesman David Ruth said
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   If he aligns with Republicans, Lott would become the majority
leader because Vice President Dick Cheney, who presides over the
Senate, has the power to break ties. If Barkley aligns with Democrats
or stays neutral, Daschle would remain majority leader for at least
several days.</TE>
<TE>   By January, or sooner, Barkley will be succeeded by the newly
elected Republican from Minnesota, Norm Coleman.</TE>
<TE>   Another Republican, Sen.-elect Jim Talent of Missouri, will take
his seat soon. Because Jean Carnahan, the Democrat he defeated, was
appointed rather than elected to the Senate, Talent is expected to be
sworn in within the next 12 days, after his election results are
certified. His arrival would definitely hand Lott the majority
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   But there is one more potential complication: The GOP's Sen. Frank
H. Murkowski, who last week was elected governor of Alaska, is to
resign his seat before he is sworn in Dec. 2. He will then have to
wait five days to name a GOP successor. That could again leave
control of the Senate briefly up to Barkley.</TE>
<TE>   As majority leader, Lott would have the power to call up bills or
nominations, although Democrats could seek to block him through a
filibuster. With neither side having the 60 votes needed to end a
filibuster, Daschle and Lott have said they expect to work by
consensus during the lame-duck session.</TE>
<TE>   One bill likely to move, Daschle said, would authorize increased
security at seaports. Also candidates for action are two bills to
overhaul bankruptcy laws and to create a federal financial backstop
for the insurance industry in the event of another terrorist attack.
Both of those bills, however, face objections from some prominent
House Republicans. The bankruptcy bill has been hung up on an
abortion-related provision and the terrorism insurance bill on a
fight over proposed limits on legal liability in lawsuits connected
to terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Congress also must decide how to fund the government. With only
two of 13 annual appropriations bills signed into law, most of the
government has been running on stopgap spending bills since the
fiscal year began Oct. 1. The latest stopgap bill expires Nov. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Many Republicans, including Lott, would prefer to delay major
spending decisions until they have control of Congress next year. But
that could meet significant bipartisan opposition, as a host of
lawmaker-favored projects -- many of them derided by critics as
pork-barrel spending -- might not be approved.</TE>
<TE>   Few battles over nominations are expected for the rest of the
year. Daschle told reporters Friday that he wants the Senate to act
on scores of judicial and executive nominations before they expire at
year's end.</TE>
<TE>   That would leave homeland security as one of the last major issues
facing the 107th Congress. The House in July passed its version of
Bush's plan to move parts or all of 22 federal agencies into one
Cabinet department whose focus would be defending against and
responding to domestic terrorist attacks. It would include such
functions as airport security, border security, the Coast Guard, the
Customs Service and the Secret Service -- but not the FBI or CIA.
With roughly 170,000 employees, it would be the third-largest Cabinet
department, after Defense and Veterans Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate must act, and then both chambers must approve a final
compromise before the legislation can become law.</TE>
<TE>   "The Department of Homeland Security will happen," said Don Kettl,
a University of Wisconsin political scientist who has followed the
debate. "It's just a question of when and under what circumstances.
The Democrats still hold a few cards, notably the fact that the
Republicans don't have 60 votes to [end debate]. But this isn't a
good time for the Democrats to try to throw their weight around,
because they don't have much."</TE>
<TE>   Lame-duck sessions are unusual. There have been six postelection
sessions in the last 30 years -- three since 1994. The last was in
2000, when Congress finished budget work under a cloud of uncertainty
about the winner of the presidential race.</TE>
<TE>   Many lawmakers dislike the unpredictability of lame-duck sessions,
when those who cast votes include the defeated and the retiring.</TE>
<TE>   "The history of lame ducks is that when you bring together a
gathering of the retired and the defeated, it's very hard to say what
they will accomplish and how long they want to stay in town," White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said last week. "So nobody knows
what the ultimate outcome will be."</TE>

<HD>Democrats Couldn't Defend Against Surge of Bush, GOP</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bottom line on the GOP's dramatic gains in the 2002 elections
could be deceptively simple. The clearest message from the results is
this: In the places where President Bush is strong, he's very strong.</LD>
<LD>   That may sound obvious. But in fact it is the depth, more than the
breadth, of Bush's appeal that makes him such a formidable political
figure. Above all, Tuesday's outcome testified to the intensity of
Bush's support in the Republican coalition, which fueled the GOP
breakthrough by surging to the polls in unexpectedly large numbers.</LD>
<LD>   This election suggests that, at least for now, Bush is locking
down virtually all of the culturally conservative areas of the
country for the GOP -- a trend with implications for control of
Congress and for the 2004 presidential race.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's achievement was historic; since the Civil War, Franklin D.
Roosevelt in 1934 was the only other president to win House and
Senate seats in his first midterm.</TE>
<TE>   But the result didn't spring from a Democratic collapse in the
places where they have been strong lately. Instead, the Democrats
failed in this election largely because they were unable to break
into the places where Republicans have been strong. Indeed, in many
of those Republican-leaning places, Democrats lost even more ground
last week.</TE>
<TE>   It's illuminating to look at Tuesday's results through the prism
of the razor-thin 2000 presidential race between Bush and Al Gore.
That election divided the country almost exactly in half, between
culturally conservative "red" states (for Bush) and more cosmopolitan
"blue" states (for Gore).</TE>
<TE>   By and large, Democrats on Tuesday held their own in Gore
territory, especially the affluent, socially liberal, suburban
counties outside the South that tilted from the GOP to the Democrats
under President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Democrats suffered erosion in some of those places.
But Democrat Jennifer Granholm still won Oakland County outside of
Detroit en route to winning the Michigan governor's race. In New
Jersey, Democrat Frank R. Lautenberg ran up big margins in Passaic,
Bergen and Middlesex counties along the way to his Senate win. And in
Pennsylvania, Democrat Ed Rendell amassed crushing margins in
Philadelphia suburbs, such as Delaware and Montgomery counties, as he
cruised to the governorship.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats saw big losses in the places Bush is most popular:
the red states, and the culturally conservative (red) parts of the
blue states.</TE>
<TE>   The stunning Republican upset in the Georgia governor's race
exemplifies the Democratic problem in the red states. It wasn't that
Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes under-performed in core Democratic areas:
He produced a bigger margin in Atlanta than he did in his victory
four years ago. Statewide, Barnes won only 9,000 fewer votes than he
did in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But Barnes was buried under a Republican surge: The party's
candidate, Sonny Perdue, collected 248,000 more votes than the GOP
nominee in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Perdue gained some ground in rural and small-town counties. But
mostly he benefited from doubled or even quadrupled margins in the
exurban counties surrounding Atlanta -- rapidly growing and
culturally conservative communities on the crab-grass frontier
between the countryside and the most distant suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota tells a similar blue-state story. Although slipping
slightly from the 1996 performance of the late Democratic Sen. Paul
Wellstone, Walter F. Mondale held Minneapolis, St. Paul and their
immediate suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale lost some ground in rural areas, but the decisive movement
came in the ring of exurban counties outside the Twin Cities. In
those counties -- which already had moved toward Bush in 2000,
helping him almost carry the state -- Republican Norm Coleman amassed
insurmountable margins. In 1996, Wellstone carried exurban Anoka and
Dakota counties; on Tuesday, Coleman won them by 21,000 and 28,000
votes, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Even California wasn't that different. Democrat Gov. Gray Davis
was routed in the more culturally conservative inland -- from
Sacramento and Fresno to San Bernardino and Riverside -- and was left
clinging to a thin sliver of socially liberal coastal counties, like
a man hanging on a ledge.</TE>
<TE>   This all suggests that Republicans on Tuesday had enormous success
at motivating voters already leaning their way, probably in large
part because of Bush's appeal. That outpouring dashed Democrats'
hopes of the red-state breakthroughs they desperately need in
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   All of the seven leading Democratic Senate challengers were
running in red states; just Mark Pryor in Arkansas won. And while
Democrats' hopes of challenging for rural or Bush-leaning GOP House
districts sputtered, the vast majority of Republican House gains came
in districts Bush carried in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 60 Senate seats in the states Bush won in 2000, Democrats
will control just 18 or 19 in the new Congress (depending on whether
Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu wins a Louisiana runoff next month).
And when results in two yet-to-be-determined races are final,
Democrats may face a 60-seat deficit among House seats in the red
states.</TE>
<TE>   Consider this: Republicans control no more House seats in the blue
states now than they did before Tuesday's vote. But in the
reapportionment after the 2000 census, the red states gained seven
House seats -- and on a net basis, the GOP will capture all of them
this year if they win the last two seats under dispute.</TE>
<TE>   In both chambers, Democrats will have to do better in the red
areas to regain the majority. But Tuesday's results say that won't be
easy anytime soon. Bush demonstrated he can translate his 90%
approval rating with his base into votes. And the cultural
differences dividing many red-state voters from the national
Democratic Party remain profound.</TE>
<TE>   These trends have presidential implications. Bush's success
Tuesday didn't guarantee him reelection. But it underscored how
difficult it will be to break his hold on almost any of the 30 states
he won in 2000 -- and offered a road map for how he could mobilize
culturally conservative voters to contest states that Gore carried,
such as Minnesota and, maybe, California.</TE>

<HD>Accidental Pollution Weighs on Texas City</HD>
<DH>Activists say a loophole in the law lets refineries in Port
Arthur harm the health of residents. Oil companies say they are not a
danger.</DH>

<DL>PORT ARTHUR, Texas</DL>
<LD>Lots of people leave this Gulf Coast industrial town -- its oil
refineries, its dilapidated houses, its boarded-up stores, its bleak
future.</LD>
<LD>   But Hilton Kelley, 42, a Hollywood stuntman and extra, returned.</LD>
<LD>   For two years he has been waging what at times seems like a
one-man battle against the many thousands of tons of pollution pumped
into the air here every year by the refineries and other major
industrial facilities.</LD>
<TE>   With the energy and persistence of someone who showed up every
time a studio called, for more than a decade, hoping that a job
standing in for Mykelti Williamson or Eddie Murphy would land him his
big chance, he is trying to cajole the perpetually passive residents
of Port Arthur into standing up and fighting for their air.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kelley has not had great success rousing the local people
to protest, he has managed to bring the city's plight to the
attention of Congress and environmental activists with national
stature.</TE>
<TE>   Now these environmentalists and their supporters in Congress are
trying to use Port Arthur to draw attention to a loophole in the 1970
Clean Air Act that allows refineries and other industrial facilities
to emit thousands of tons of hazardous pollutants into the air
without regulation.</TE>
<TE>   The Clean Air Act requires the states to limit the allowable
pollution from industrial facilities. To give industry a break,
regulators excluded from the limits pollution emitted during
accidents, machinery malfunctions and even plant maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the refining industry, taking advantage of the
loophole, has failed to aggressively avoid accidents or develop ways
to limit pollution from malfunctions.</TE>
<TE>   "This was supposed to be a rare thing," said Eric Schaeffer,
director of the Rockefeller Family Fund's Environmental Integrity
Project and former head of the Environmental Protection Agency's
enforcement division. "But the exceptions have become the rule."</TE>
<TE>   Data submitted to the Texas environmental agency by three local
refineries and two chemical plants show that these unregulated
releases in the first seven months of this year totaled more than
1,677 tons of several hazardous pollutants, including sulfur dioxide,
hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide and benzene, according to an
analysis by the integrity project.</TE>
<TE>   "A ton of pollution is a ton of pollution, whether it's accidental
or permitted," Schaeffer said. Refineries are used to a system in
which some kinds of releases don't count, he added, but the
environment suffers either way.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the Environmental Protection Agency has tried to
crack down on refineries it believes are abusing the loophole. The
Clinton administration's EPA formally began its campaign in January
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, one-third of refineries nationwide, including the
Motiva plant in Port Arthur, have struck agreements with the federal
government, and many have dramatically reduced pollution, according
to EPA officials. BP's refinery in Toledo, Ohio, went from 255
unregulated releases over the five years before the improvements to
only three in the three years since, EPA spokesman Joe Martyak said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has continued the effort. But critics
charge that progress has slowed because the administration has
proposed cutting the enforcement budget each year and, in its 2003
budget proposal, trimming staff by about 225, to 3,311.</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials respond that the agency is still working
aggressively to bring the refineries in line. "The pace and the
attention to this have not changed in any way," Martyak said.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, unregulated releases still pose an acute problem in
Port Arthur.</TE>
<TE>   The 11 refineries that the EPA singled out in 2000 as the "worst"
emitters of unregulated pollution released between 1,000 tons and
2,425 tons a year from 1994 to 1999. By comparison, the three
refineries and two chemical companies in Port Arthur released more
than 2,000 tons of excess pollutants in just the first nine months of
this year, according to the Environmental Integrity Project's
analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley, public health experts and national environmental activists
agree that the problem has persisted in Port Arthur in part because
the community is poor and lacks political clout. About 6% of the
nation's refining capacity is in Port Arthur, according to the
American Petrochemical Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mind so much that we produce oil for the rest of the
nation," Kelley said. "I am bothered by the lack of concern our
government gives for our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson County, home of Port Arthur, is among the worst 10% of
counties nationwide for health problems from hazardous air
pollutants, according to an analysis of EPA data by the nonprofit
group Environmental Defense.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the town's refineries stress that they have spent
many millions of dollars installing pollution control devices, so
that their plants no longer threaten the health of residents.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no health effects that we are aware of," said Rick
Hagar, a spokesman for the Atofina refinery.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents tell a different story. They complain of breathing
problems, headaches, sniffles and watery eyes. Symptoms are most
acute, they say, when the plants release bursts of unregulated
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Lillie Rollins, 59, was inside her aging wood-frame house July 24
when a loud boom sent her running out her door. She saw large flames
and black smoke -- "a big fire, big enough to scare you" -- wafting
toward her house from the nearby Motiva refinery.</TE>
<TE>   She called the refinery to ask whether the four grandchildren who
live with her were in danger from breathing the toxins in the smoke.
The company transferred her around and put her on hold. She never got
an answer.</TE>
<TE>   Refinery records show a fire in the unit that removes sulfur from
diesel fuel released 2 tons of sulfur dioxide, a respiratory irritant
linked to asthma and early death.</TE>
<TE>   Rollins traces her occasional fast heartbeat to unregulated
pollution. "The only time it does it is when there's a bad odor from
the refinery," she said. "It makes my heart flutter."</TE>
<TE>   A study by the University of Texas medical branch in Galveston
found significantly elevated health problems in Port Arthur and
neighboring Beaumont compared with Galveston, which is not as
industrial.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried many years ago to organize the community," said Marvin
Legator, an environmental toxicologist. "They are so down on their
luck and so many of them lost the spirit to fight."</TE>
<TE>   Legator is heartened by Kelley's enthusiastic effort to turn
things around.</TE>
<TE>   "He's given these people a little more spirit and little more
hope," Legator said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kelley's efforts to organize the community are hardly a
success yet. When he staged a protest outside City Hall last winter,
only two others joined him, and one was his brother.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he perseveres. He gathers signatures for protest letters,
collects air samples in buckets, demands answers from the refineries
when accidents send smoke wafting through neighborhoods and holds
meetings to inform citizens of the dangers.</TE>
<TE>   His ambition is not to shut down the refineries but to make them
clean up.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley grew up in a housing project in the shadows of two
refineries. He left Port Arthur at 18 to join the Navy, and spent
most of his adult life in California.</TE>
<TE>   When Kelley returned to Port Arthur two years ago, Alfred Dominic,
now 75, a retired waste-water supervisor, challenged him to focus on
combating pollution. He has nothing but praise for what Kelley has
accomplished. "This is a young man who is focused," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to show people they can make changes if they choose to,"
said Kelley, wearing a Hawaiian print shirt, flip flops and his cell
phone's headset. "A lot of folks in town believe they are powerless.
They believe the refineries run this town."</TE>
<TE>   The refineries see Kelley as a source of undeserved bad publicity.
Premcor manager of environmental health and safety Morris Carter said
his company already had tackled the problem of unregulated emissions.</TE>
<TE>   But reports from the Premcor plant show that its unregulated
releases during the first seven months of this year totaled 369 tons
of sulfur dioxide and 114 tons of volatile organic compounds. These
emissions contribute to smog and pose health risks, including cancer,
lung damage and birth defects.</TE>
<TE>   "When a plant just had 350 tons of [unregulated] emissions in less
than seven months -- that's a candidate for enforcement," said
Schaeffer, of the environmental integrity project. "Their record is
terrible."</TE>
<TE>   The local congressman stresses that the region's economic health
relies on the refineries. "We have to recognize some of the efforts
of some of the companies," said Democrat Nick Lampson. Otherwise, he
said, "we'll lose those companies, and that would be devastating."</TE>
<TE>   But Kelley is determined to ruffle the refineries' feathers, even
if it means that some of his high school friends refuse to talk to
him. "They think I'm a troublemaker," he said proudly, "and I am."</TE>

<HD>Defense Decries Malvo Interrogation</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>McLEAN, Va.</DL>
<LD>Defense attorneys said Sunday that they will seek to suppress a
police interrogation of 17-year-old sniper suspect Lee Boyd Malvo in
which he reportedly confessed to some of the shootings.</LD>
<LD>   Citing anonymous sources, the Washington Post reported Sunday that
Malvo admitted pulling the trigger on several of the shootings that
left 10 people dead and three others wounded during a three-week
spree through metropolitan Washington, Virginia and Maryland.</LD>
<LD>   Malvo's lawyer, Michael Arif, criticized police Sunday for leaking
the story and questioned its accuracy.</LD>
<TE>   "The police are flooding the media and poisoning the jury pool
with their own paraphrasing and subjective interpretations of
statements made during an unconstitutional interrogation," Arif said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the leak "suggests an insecurity on the part of [Virginia]
with the admissibility of these statements."</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax County police declined to comment about the interrogation;
Fairfax County Commonwealth's Atty. Robert F. Horan Jr. did not
return calls Sunday seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   One of the shootings for which Malvo reportedly took
responsibility was the Oct. 14 death of FBI analyst Linda Franklin.
Malvo is charged with capital murder in that crime.</TE>
<TE>   Malvo and John Allen Muhammad, 41, were handed over to Virginia
authorities Thursday after the federal government dropped charges so
the state could prosecute them on death-penalty murder charges.</TE>

<HD>At Least 10 People Are Killed as Tornadoes Hit Tennessee,
Ohio</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLARKSVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Devastating, tornado-laden storms ripped through Tennessee and Ohio
on Sunday, killing at least 10 people, trapping others in buildings
and leaving thousands without power, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   At least five tornadoes swept across middle and western Tennessee
packing winds up to 140 mph, the National Weather Service said.</LD>
<LD>   Five people were confirmed dead and at least 21 injured in Ohio,
where a weather spotter saw at least four twisters hit rural
northwestern Van Wert County, sheriff's officials said.</LD>
<TE>   To the northeast, in Putnam County, two people were killed and one
critically injured when a mobile home overturned, said Sgt. Brad
Nelson of the sheriff's office. A house collapsed in Seneca County,
killing one person and injuring two others.</TE>
<TE>   Another person died after being thrown from a car, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   The storms cut a 100-mile swath from Van Wert near the Indiana
state line to Port Clinton along Lake Erie.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Robert A. Taft declared a state of emergency in Van Wert and
Ottawa counties, though storms downed power lines, closed roads and
poured golf-ball-size hail in many areas.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Farris of Van Wert said he saw a tornado touch down outside
the city, leveling a house.</TE>
<TE>   "It pulled everything off, set it down, then threw it in a field,"
he said. "It was on the ground at least a mile."</TE>
<TE>   At least five people were killed and 25 injured in Tennessee,
including two Sunday night after a second line of storms crossed
central Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   All of the state's 95 counties were under tornado watches.</TE>
<TE>   In middle Tennessee, Steven Graves and his wife survived after
wind rolled their Sumner County mobile home 50 feet. "I could feel
the trailer crumbling apart and I remember thinking I was going to
die," Graves told WSMV-TV of Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   In Montgomery County, 40 miles northwest of Nashville, Dennis and
Karen Louise Tooby were killed when a tornado blew their mobile home
off its foundation and hurled it into a field, officials said.
Laqueeta Forsythe, 65, was killed when a tornado overturned her
mobile home in Carroll County, about 100 miles west of Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   In western Tennessee, tornadoes damaged a dormitory at Union
University in Jackson, and several homes and a nursing home in Bells,
150 miles southwest of Nashville.</TE>

<HD>No Rap on Eminem: He Gets His Shot, His Opportunity, and
Doesn't Let It Slip</HD>
<DH>'8 Mile,' starring the top-selling artist, draws people of
all ages and has the second-best opening weekend ever for an R-rated
film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynn Smith, Geoff Boucher and Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After lunch at Neiman-Marcus, Jane Ann Kuster, 73, moved into the
dark confines of the Edwards Big Newport theater Saturday,
accompanied by her friend and neighbor Armida Persello, 72. Kuster
wanted to introduce her friend to Eminem, starring in his first
movie, "8 Mile," and to witness his attempt to travel the distance
from much-denounced rapper to mainstream movie star. Evidently, the
journey was a success -- and financed not just by the fans you might
expect. Powered by strong reviews in major newspapers, a hit song on
the radio and a relentless ad campaign, the movie grossed an
estimated $54.5 million over the weekend, far higher than expected.
Universal Pictures reported that most of the "8 Mile" weekend
moviegoers were under 25 and white -- and, intriguingly for a rap
movie, female -- but almost a third were over 25, like Kuster and
Persello in Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Until Sunday, filmmakers had been unsure whether middle Americans
would be willing to spend two hours in the dark with Eminem, whose
stated goal has been to "[expletive] the world off." But as the
septuagenarians demonstrated, many welcomed him with open arms, some
applauding perceived messages of authenticity, hard work and personal
responsibility in the film. "He's a doll," Kuster said. "What you see
is what you get. I don't think he puts on any pretense."</LD>
<TE>   It made for some interesting weekend movie lines, and nowhere was
the people-watching more fascinating than in the children and parents
at theaters together. Many baby-boomer parents were already fans
themselves. Deedee Williams, 50, founder of a Beverly Hills global
consulting biotech company, said she had to talk her 14-year-old son,
Matt, into coming along.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its rating, bestowed for "strong language, sexuality, some
violence and drug use," others found positive messages for kids in
the movie. "From the ghetto, he ended up making something of himself.
I think that's a positive thing in our society today," said Santa Ana
psychologist Robin Carr, who brought two children and a friend, ages
12 to 15. Although he "cussed too much," he was also "trying to make
ends meet," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem is the first white artist to become an airplay staple on
rap radio stations in major markets. In a recording career of just
three albums in four years, he has established himself as the
best-selling solo rap artist ever in a genre that has been almost
exclusively defined by black artists. The movie has a potent hit song
in it, "Lose Yourself," which has been one of his biggest radio hits.
The "8 Mile" soundtrack also debuted last month at No. 1 on the U.S.
album charts. A second soundtrack, this one featuring the music from
the rap "battle" scenes in the film, is in the works.</TE>
<TE>   Despite critics who champion him as a relevant and clever cultural
provocateur, Eminem has been assailed by others as a loutish,
foul-mouthed rapper. For much of America until now, Eminem is best
known for the protests against him before the Grammys in 2001, or
perhaps the courtroom photos from his brushes with the law. His
lyrics about women and gays have drawn protests and his albums are
brimming with graphic language and violent imagery. Unlike Eminem's
CDs, there is no "clean" version of "8 Mile" available for the
younger teens who follow his music.</TE>
<TE>   The film, directed by the critically respected Curtis Hanson,
tells a classic Hollywood tale of "underdog makes good" by describing
the struggle of a white boy trying to make it in the black, urban rap
scene of impoverished Detroit. Unlike his mother's boyfriend, he has
a job -- making steel bumpers at a stamping plant. Another message in
the film is that connection in art and class can overcome race
differences.</TE>
<TE>   The R rating didn't hinder the movie's popularity, said its
producer, Brian Grazer.</TE>
<TE>   "The message of the movie is so positive that I think parents are
just looking the other way," Grazer said. "Parents felt they could
kind of get away from those [other hip-hop films]. But with Eminem,
it's in their face and it forces them to understand the language."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, theaters nationwide were packed. It was the second-biggest
opening weekend for an R-rated movie, behind "Hannibal," which made
$58 million its opening weekend in 2001. "8 Mile" averaged more than
$22,000 per screen; $10,000 is considered good in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   At Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade on Friday night, unlikely
moviegoers included people such as Cynthia Webber, who accompanied
her 33-year-old son, Hugh, to the movie. "I think it's a great story
-- how he came up out of a really tough life," she said. "And also
his music is really good. People don't expect someone my age to like
his music, but I do."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not everyone had an obliging parent as an escort.
Outside the theater, kids under the admissible age of 17 milled
about, working their charm to persuade any adult to accompany them or
buy their tickets. AMC theater workers vigilantly checked IDs at the
door and turned away a desperate girl who pleaded in vain that she'd
just forgotten her identification.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents said they wanted to accompany their children in order
to better understand that generation's tastes. "I'm not a fan at all.
I've listened to the lyrics and some of them are terrible," said
Beverly Levitt, a management consultant from Sherman Oaks who was
weekending in Newport Beach with her husband, Barry, and their
14-year-old daughter, Lindsey, who had been looking forward to the
film for months. "But I'm a fan of my daughter. I'm trying to
understand her by watching this." Barry, a retired communication
engineer, said he was curious to see how the rapper did as an actor.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey, observing from several feet away, said the enthusiasm of
her parents, both 59, put her in a bind. The only reason she agreed
to go out with her parents is that they were far enough from home.
"In L.A., I wouldn't be caught, like, dead," she said. Still, she
planned to sit by herself.</TE>
<TE>   The crossover appeal of Eminem-as-movie-star appears to run
counter to the nature of a youth-oriented culture that, by
definition, appreciates popular music that upsets adults. But Lindsey
explained, "I don't like him out of rebellion. I just like him." Some
parents with children were taken aback at a hot sex scene between
Eminem's character and his girlfriend (played by Brittany Murphy).
Some also felt uncomfortable with violent scenes witnessed by his
terrified younger sister.</TE>
<TE>   Though laced with profanities, the movie is tame compared with the
rapper's concerts, where he unleashes torrents of obscenities. "The
concerts are far raunchier than anything in this movie," said Stephen
Hill, vice president of music programming and talent for Black
Entertainment Television.</TE>
<TE>   "His audience is expanding," said Carson Daly, host of MTV's
"Total Request Live," who had Eminem on his show Friday. "For people
who don't know him, people who say, 'What is this Eminem guy all
about?,' they'll go see this movie, and answering that question is
what this movie does best."</TE>
<TE>   Eminem could not be reached Sunday. In an e-mail interview with
The Times last month, he said he had set out to make a serious movie,
not a comic or hit-driven goof. "The movie marked the direction I
wanted to go in, which allowed me to see if I can really act and to
document the scene in Detroit that I came from," said the rapper,
whose real name is Marshall Mathers III. As for a possible second act
as an actor, he said: "I'm going to take it one step at a time. I'm
not interested in becoming a full-time actor anytime soon, but if the
right opportunity comes along, who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Back in Newport Beach, Jane Ann Kuster came out of his debut movie
and said she hadn't quite understood every part of the film, but she
never pays any attention to the swear words anyway. "It's the music
that's so great. I loved the way he takes notes in every little
corner of the paper. It's fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   Her friend, Armida Persello, said she was shocked in a way, but
enjoyed the movie nonetheless. For her, the only thing lacking in the
rags-to-riches story was the riches.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping he would end up rich and help his mom and the little
child," she said.</TE>

<HD>20 Female Afghan Prisoners Go Free Under Presidential
Amnesty</HD>
<DH>Most were in jail for social code violations such as
adultery. But Kabul police chief says he'll continue making such
arrests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valerie Reitman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Even as this capital's police chief vowed to continue arresting women
for offenses such as adultery and dating men not chosen by their
families, 20 imprisoned on such charges were released here Sunday in
an amnesty authorized by President Hamid Karzai.</LD>
<LD>   Some had been locked up under the Taliban, the hard-line Islamic
regime that was overthrown by a U.S.-led coalition a year ago, but
many were tossed in jail under Karzai's government, mostly for social
code violations or property crimes. The president said he granted
them pardons to coincide with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which
began last week.</LD>
<LD>   As the women, who spent between five months and two years behind
bars, walked out, some clutched children who had been incarcerated
with them if there was no one else to care for them. While inside,
the women wore street clothes with head scarves, but they wore burkas
when they emerged.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, two of the 10 women left behind in the jailhouse threw
themselves at the feet of the guards, begging to be let go too.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't you release all of us? I have four children," said
Jamillah, sobbing. She said she was thrown in jail after running away
from her husband to her uncle's house.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities expected the remaining women to be released soon from
the facility, where about six inmates are confined in each
6-by-9-foot cell. The United Nations and human rights groups have
criticized the tough prison conditions, which include a lack of
medical care, poor hygiene and vermin.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, Jamillah's mother, Rahima, was waiting with other
prisoners' relatives in the hopes that her daughter would be among
those pardoned.</TE>
<TE>   Clad in a white scarf that covered her weathered face and dyed
orange hair, Rahima said Jamillah's husband had turned her in to
police for running off with a cousin.</TE>
<TE>   The younger woman had spent 1 1/2 years in prison, her mother
said, while her four children remained home with their father.</TE>
<TE>   Among those released was Fahima, a round-faced woman wearing a
black veil. She said she waited three years for her husband to come
back after he divorced her, but then her father insisted she marry a
man in the southern city of Kandahar, with whom she lived for several
years before leaving him. He pressed charges against her.</TE>
<TE>   Another woman freed, Safura, holding the 1-year-old daughter who
had been with her, said she spent two months in jail after she was
falsely accused of killing her husband's brother. Another brother,
who disliked her, had accused her of murder out of personal enmity,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Noor Bugun, in a blue burka with the front pulled back so that her
face was visible, was also at the gate, waiting for the release of
her daughter, Salima, 17, who was imprisoned for four months after
she refused to marry the man her family had chosen for her years
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The fiance spent eight years in Iran, where he married someone
else, and when he returned, Salima didn't want to marry him, her
mother said. The would-be father-in-law pressed charges against
Salima.</TE>
<TE>   Although the repressive Taliban, which refused to let girls go to
school or leave their homes without burkas, is gone, the crimes
Afghan women continue to be accused of remain debatable. Often, it is
the women's families who take matters to the police.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul Police Chief Gen. Abdul Basir said Sunday that his men would
go on making such arrests if a husband or family pressed charges.</TE>
<TE>   "They will be prosecuted if they want to marry someone else" --
other than men chosen by their families -- "or if they have a husband
and want to live with somebody else illegally," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the police shouldn't be concentrating on pursuing
more dangerous criminals, the chief -- a tall, former senior
commander with the Northern Alliance, which had fought the Taliban --
said that if his men didn't act in such cases, their negligence would
lead to serious crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't listen to the families, they will kill the women
themselves," Basir said.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, fathers, who head the households in this
patriarchal society, relent.</TE>
<TE>   Nazer Husain, 65, a farmer wearing a beat-up blue-and-white
turban, was waiting outside the prison hoping that his 20-year-old
daughter, Safia, would be released. She had run away with a boy she
liked, spurning the man -- a cousin -- her family had selected for
her.</TE>
<TE>   Husain had turned her in to police nine days before, he said,
"because it wasn't good that she went with that boy without my
permission." He noted that she had also stolen his watch and $1,200.</TE>
<TE>   The father said he had wanted to punish Safia in the most severe
way he could think of. He said he still believes that families should
decide whom their daughters should marry.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, if she returned the money and the watch, Husain
said, he planned to give her to the boy she liked.</TE>

<HD>Arabs Urge Iraq to Comply</HD>
<DH>Foreign ministers call on Hussein to accept U.N.
inspections 'to solve all standing issues peacefully.' They reject
any military action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Lamb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Arab League foreign ministers meeting in an emergency session here
said Sunday that Iraq is likely to accept the U.N. resolution giving
arms inspectors unrestricted access and demanding that Saddam Hussein
destroy any weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   The Iraqi president has until Friday to officially accept or
reject the resolution. If he accepts, the inspectors, led by Hans
Blix, will return to Baghdad by next Monday to set up logistical
facilities. They withdrew from Iraq in 1998 after being denied access
to Hussein's palaces and being accused by Hussein of spying.</LD>
<LD>   The Iraqi News Agency reported Sunday that Hussein had called an
emergency session of parliament for today to consider the U.N.
demands. But Arab diplomats noted that the parliament, which is made
up of Hussein supporters, and the Revolutionary Command Council,
which the president heads, are largely irrelevant. Hussein makes the
decisions.</LD>
<TE>   Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri, after conferring with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and his counterparts at the daylong meeting
of the 22-member Arab League, told reporters in Cairo that "no
decision has been taken." But Arab League sources said they had
received Sabri's assurance of likely compliance and expected a
positive response from Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   In a final communique, the participants in Sunday's meeting called
on Hussein to accept the U.N. terms as part of an effort "to solve
all standing issues peacefully in preparation for the lifting of
sanctions and the end of the [U.N.] embargo as well as the suffering
of the Iraqi people." The ministers also asserted their "absolute
rejection" of any military action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The toughly worded U.N. resolution, initiated by the United States
and passed unanimously by the Security Council on Friday, threatens
"serious consequences" if Hussein fails to comply with its terms.
Although the Bush administration has reserved the right to respond
unilaterally if Iraq is in violation of U.N. demands, Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell has said the United States would go back to the
Security Council before taking any military action.</TE>
<TE>   It was that assurance, delivered by Powell in a letter to Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh, that persuaded Syria -- the only Arab
country on the Security Council -- to cast a surprising vote in favor
of the resolution Friday. Syria and other Arab states are portraying
the resolution as the best way to avoid war in a region already rife
with tension, much of it fueled by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.N. resolution provides the opportunity for a peaceful
settlement," Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher said. "The
resolution has pushed the phantom of war into the distance for
several weeks or several months. Our goal is to spare Iraq and the
region from a military strike."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the resolution was passed, Arab League members --
particularly Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan -- played an important
role in pushing Hussein to accept U.N. demands and the return of
weapons inspectors. They were particularly blunt with Iraq's foreign
minister at the Cairo meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "We're telling Iraq the Americans are really serious and this time
we're not with you," said a senior advisor to one Arab delegation.
"If you reject the resolution, you're on your own. You've got no
choice."</TE>
<TE>   Arab governments view Hussein with disdain, and most would no
doubt be pleased if he was overthrown. But none are eager for war.
They fear that military action against Iraq would result in a
drawn-out conflict and that post-Hussein instability could spill over
Iraq's borders. As one Arab diplomat put it: "A war in Iraq takes us
into the unknown."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's acceptance of the resolution would not end the threat of
war. Many Arabs worry that the U.S. is looking for an excuse to
attack. Hussein is likely to seek delaying tactics and raise
obstacles to impede the weapons inspectors, as he did after the 1991
Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has already drawn up plans to attack Iraq by
land, sea and air in a campaign involving at least 200,000 ground
troops.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington on Sunday, senior administration officials warned
that President Bush is still assessing potential military operations
against Iraq and that he anticipates an international coalition of
political and military support if an attack is launched.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Hussein] doesn't comply this time, we are going to ask the
U.N. to give authorization for all necessary means," Powell said on
CNN's "Late Edition." "If the U.N. isn't willing to do that, the
United States, with like-minded nations, will go and disarm him
forcefully."</TE>
<TE>   Under the new resolution, Hussein must declare or surrender all
programs for weapons of mass destruction by Dec. 8. The U.N.
inspection teams must report to the Security Council by Feb. 21. But
Powell said Iraq's compliance may be judged much earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to wait until February to see if Iraq is
cooperating or not," Powell said. U.S. and U.N. officials "will be
able to make a judgment as to cooperation very quickly, not sometime
in February," he added. Powell said Hussein "knows if he violates
this resolution, military force is coming in to take him and his
regime out."</TE>
<TE>   On CBS' "Face the Nation," Powell urged senior Iraqi officers to
defect, especially if a war begins. "The outcome is certain," he
said. "The regime will be destroyed, the regime will be defeated, and
these generals had better make a judgment as to which side of the
wall they want to be on when it's all over."</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security
advisor, said Bush "has made no secret of the fact that he intends to
use force if the Iraqis cannot be brought into compliance in other
ways. And so, it wouldn't surprise anybody that he is assessing the
military options before him."</TE>
<TE>   The only question, Rice said on "Fox News Sunday," is "whether
this time Saddam Hussein intends to cooperate. We do not need to
waste the world's time with another game of cat and mouse."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein, Rice said, "has to lead the inspectors to facilities. He
has to provide access to people who know what's going on in these
programs."</TE>
<TE>   She said "one of the most important elements" of the resolution is
the requirement that U.N. officials be allowed to freely interview,
and if necessary take out of the country, Iraqi scientists,
technicians and officials with direct knowledge of any weapons
programs. Such officials, and their families, must be "protected,"
she added.</TE>
<TE>   Rice declined to specify precisely what would trigger a U.S.
attack. But she repeated warnings that the White House would not
tolerate defiance by the Baghdad regime.</TE>
<TE>   "I would assume that the next time that Saddam Hussein
demonstrably gives false information, he's going to be held in
material breach, because we have to have a zero tolerance view of the
Iraqi regime this time," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Arab League's "absolute rejection" of military action,
most Arab governments are believed ready to offer Washington access
to some military facilities, permission for overflights and use of
the Suez Canal.</TE>

<LD>Britain will scrap its legal protection against double jeopardy and
make tougher sentences available to judges as part of a major
overhaul of the country's criminal justice system, Prime Minister
Tony Blair said in a newspaper article.</LD>
<LD>   Writing in the Observer, he said the changes were intended to
redress an imbalance that favored criminals instead of crime victims.
Protection against double jeopardy forbids authorities to charge a
defendant twice with the same crime.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers and civil liberties groups said the proposals outlined by
Blair were misguided and may lead to an increase in the number of
innocent people being jailed.</LD>

<LD>Afghanistan's Central Bank extended by a month its deadline for
swapping old bank notes for new ones to give people time to join in
its ambitious new currency program.</LD>
<LD>   The country is introducing new bank notes, lopping three zeros off
the old afghani, which now trades at 72,000 to the dollar. But the
transition has been beset by logistical problems, including disposal
of the millions of old bills.</LD>
<LD>   The swap will now end Jan. 2 instead of Dec. 4.</LD>

<DL>MANILA</DL>
<LD>Trailing smoke from its left wing, a twin-engine commuter airplane
carrying 34 people crashed into Manila Bay shortly after takeoff
today. At least 14 people on board were killed and 16 survivors were
plucked from the water, an airline official said.</LD>
<LD>   The plane sank 50 to 60 feet, and divers were searching for four
people who remained missing, said Alvin Manual Yater, assistant vice
president of Laoag International Airlines.</LD>
<LD>   Passenger Steve Thompson, 25, of Sydney, Australia, said he saw
smoke coming from the left side of the 44-seat Fokker 27 just before
the pilot came on the intercom to tell those on board to brace for
impact. Thompson said he had been flying with five friends to the
northern city of Laoag for a surfing vacation.</LD>
<TE>   "The plane took off. It flew for three minutes, and then the
engine kind of got quiet," Thompson said after being taken to the
navy's bayside headquarters. His toes and arm were bandaged.</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed some smoke coming out of the left engine, and then it
banked. Then we ended up down in the water," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the passengers panicked, Thompson said: "The cabin
instantly filled with water, so no one made any noises." He said he
didn't know what had happened to his friends.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine Air Transportation chief Adelberto Yap said the pilot
had reported engine trouble.</TE>

<HD>Iran Parliament Joins Death Sentence Protest</HD>
<DH>A majority calls for lifting verdict against an academic
accused of insulting Islam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Nearly two-thirds of Iran's parliament called Sunday for lifting the
death sentence for a reformist scholar convicted of insulting Islam
and questioning hard-line clerics.</LD>
<LD>   Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi, in a speech broadcast live on
state-run Tehran radio, said that a hard-line court's sentence
against university professor Hashem Aghajari was a "disgusting"
verdict and that the scholar should be released. He called on the
hard-line judiciary to overturn the sentence "before we pay a heavier
price for it."</LD>
<LD>   After Karrubi's speech, 181 members of the 290-seat parliament
signed a letter urging the lifting of the death sentence.</LD>
<TE>   The conviction against Aghajari, a history professor at Tehran
University, stems from a June speech in which he said that the
clerics' teachings on Islam were considered sacred simply because
they were part of history and that each new generation should be able
to interpret the faith on its own.</TE>
<TE>   The comments enraged hard-liners, who organized street
demonstrations and urged the courts to prosecute Aghajari.</TE>
<TE>   Aghajari was detained in August and remains in custody. He was
informed of the death sentence Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition against the sentence is building. Two lawmakers have
resigned in protest, and hundreds of students held a demonstration
Saturday at Tehran University. A second student demonstration was
held Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   About 500 students crammed into an auditorium to hear speakers
condemn the verdict and sharply criticize Iran's clerical and
political leaders. Witnesses said the speeches were bolder than any
heard from the student body in several years.</TE>
<TE>   "We want Aghajari and his lawyer not to appeal the verdict to see
what happens to him. If he is hanged, we will be next to him," one
male student said to wild cheers and applause.</TE>
<TE>   "They are executing a professor of the university just for
speaking his opinion," said another.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Fights Back With Commerce</HD>
<DH>Facing threat of war, Hussein's government signs lucrative
contracts, especially with nations that oppose the U.S.-led effort to
oust the regime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evelyn Iritani</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a country operating under strict economic sanctions and the
threat of war, Iraq is an awfully busy place. Ships carrying tons of
Australian wheat and Vietnamese rice unload their cargo every week in
the port of Umm al Qasr. France's giant Alcatel telecom firm is
working on a $76-million project to repair the country's telephone
system, heavily damaged during the Persian Gulf War.</LD>
<LD>   In the face of last week's arms-control ultimatum from the United
Nations and warnings that Washington is ready to use force, the
government of Saddam Hussein is fighting back with old-fashioned
dollar diplomacy. Using the billions it is allowed to spend under the
oil-for-food program administered by the United Nations, the Iraqi
regime is conspicuously doling out lucrative contracts in hopes of
undermining the U.S.-led campaign to oust it from power, according to
businesspeople and Middle East experts.</LD>
<LD>   Those efforts were on full display at the 35th annual Baghdad
International Fair, which ended Sunday with Iraqi Trade Minister
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh's announcement that his government had signed
more than 20 oil-for-food contracts worth $500 million with Saudi
Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, France and Spain. The 10-day
trade fair attracted 1,600 companies representing 49 countries, most
from the Middle East and Europe, according to the official Iraqi
media.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier, the Iraqis declared the government's intention to also
reward Germany with contracts in exchange for its opposition to the
U.S. campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraqi-German relations have witnessed a notable improvement after
the firm positive stand of Germany in rejecting the launching of a
military attack against Iraq by the U.S.," the government-run
newspaper Iraq Daily stated in an article on the trade fair.
"Accordingly, President Saddam Hussein has ordered to give priority
to German companies to enter the Iraqi market."</TE>
<TE>   But with politics and business so closely intertwined, companies
and countries are keenly aware that they could fall out of favor
under a new regime.</TE>
<TE>   Years of war and the trade sanctions imposed by the United Nations
in 1990 have forced Iraq to operate on the sidelines of the global
economy. However, even a shackled Iraqi government offers attractive
opportunities for firms angling for a piece of the oil-for-food
program. Established in 1995, the program allows Iraq to sell oil and
use the funds to buy humanitarian goods such as grains and vegetable
oils, medical supplies and machinery. The U.N. must approve those
contracts and can deny a sale if it does not fit the program's
humanitarian goals.</TE>
<TE>   In the last six years, Iraq has received more than $56 billion in
oil revenue, and signed contracts for an estimated $36 billion worth
of food and other supplies, under the program, according to the
Coalition for International Justice, a Washington-based human rights
group that just released a report on Hussein's legal and illegal
revenue sources. The coalition says Hussein and his close associates
took in more than $2 billion this year from illegal sales of oil to
Syria and kickbacks and smuggling tied to the U.N. humanitarian
program.</TE>
<TE>   "These trade fairs are wonderful propaganda devices," said Susan
Blaustein, a senior consultant and co-author of the coalition's
report. "Baghdad can show, at least to the Arab world, that it is
doing business, the sanctions aren't working and people want to do
business there."</TE>
<TE>   The single biggest customer for Iraqi oil has been the United
States. From January to August of this year, Iraq was America's
sixth-largest supplier, providing 525,000 barrels of oil a day, or
4.6% of total U.S. imports, according to the American Petroleum
Institute. Refineries in Texas and California, which make their
purchases largely through European traders, like Iraqi crude because
it is a low-sulfur product that is cheaper to process, according to
oil experts.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi government has been quite open about using its economic
clout for political gain. Iraq, the leading customer of U.S. wheat
and long-grain rice in the 1980s, is now the top purchaser of wheat
from Australia and rice from Vietnam. France and Russia, considered
crucial counterweights to the United States in the U.N. Security
Council, were the largest recipients of contracts in the early years
of the U.N. program, according to U.N. documents. More recently, many
of Iraq's neighbors -- Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, Syria and the United
Arab Emirates -- have seen their share of contracts increase
dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   Though Cargill Inc. and a handful of other U.S. firms were awarded
contracts for agricultural exports early in the U.N. program, the
United States and Britain -- America's staunchest ally in the
campaign to disarm Hussein -- have largely been frozen out of any
oil-for-food contracts in recent years. U.S. executives have laid low
during the Iraq debate, anxious not to appear predatory or
anti-patriotic. But privately, they express excitement about
regaining those markets if the U.S. government succeeds in opening
those doors.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just sitting and waiting because Iraq is where our
expertise is," said Ray Kafaji, an executive with Luxor California
Exports Corp., a San Diego company that sold $50 million worth of
food and machinery to Iraq earlier in the oil-for-food program but
has not received any contracts in two years. "We are boycotted by the
Iraqis just because we are a U.S. company."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the political barriers were lifted, American firms would
need to overcome any lingering animosities that Iraqis might harbor
against the United States, according to some U.S. executives. "We
would be in there very fast and working very hard to try to resolve
any perceived political problems," said Tom Mick, executive director
for the Washington Wheat Commission, an export promotion group.</TE>
<TE>   Australians know how tenuous those ties can be. In August, an
angry Iraqi government halted the unloading of wheat from Australia
after the country backed the U.S. in its campaign against Iraq. But
after Australian Wheat Board Chief Executive Andrew Lindberg paid a
conciliatory visit to Baghdad, the Iraqi government agreed to resume
the imports, which were worth $420 million to Australia last year.</TE>
<TE>   Peter McBride, a spokesman for the wheat board, said he is
confident that his growers can hang on to their top market. "We
believe we can continue to trade with them," he said. "They have a
lot of respect for the Australian wheat grower."</TE>
<TE>   Some foreign executives have voiced concerns that U.S. companies
would be given an unfair advantage in a post-Hussein economy run by a
government beholden to the United States. Those fears are
particularly noticeable in the oil industry, which is anxious to get
access to Iraq's vast reserves, second only to Saudi Arabia's.</TE>
<TE>   As of last month, Iraq had negotiated contracts for future oil
exploration worth as much as $38 billion with companies from Russia,
China and France, according to Deutsche Bank. But little progress has
been made on those contracts because of the U.N. sanctions, and there
is skepticism that they will all pan out, according to a U.S.
Department of Energy report on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Assessing Iraq's economic clout is difficult because of the lack
of independent data and the high level of under-the-table activity.
Iraq is known for announcing large trade and investment deals with
great fanfare for propaganda purposes, but they often don't
materialize, according to Middle East experts.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no question that the economic fallout of a regime
change in Iraq would be the greatest for its neighbors, who have been
the biggest recipients of Hussein's legal and illegal largess. In the
last two years, the Iraqi government has signed 11 free-trade
agreements, most of them with countries in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the Middle Eastern countries who are opposed to the war
on Iraq are motivated by the fear that such a war will harm them
economically," said Nimrod Raphaeli, a senior analyst with the Middle
East Media Research Institute in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Take Syria, a longtime rival of Iraq whose relations have warmed
dramatically in recent years. Last year, Damascus signed a free-trade
agreement with Baghdad. Iraq also is believed to be earning as much
as $100 million a month in illegal revenue from oil shipped through
Syria, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's King Abdullah II is vulnerable. Iraq is Jordan's top
trading partner and the source of $600 million in U.N.-approved oil a
year. Jordanian companies also do about $400 million a year in
business under the U.N. oil-for-food program. But the U.S. is
Jordan's No. 2 trading partner and provides the government with about
$400 million in aid a year.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats in Amman said a new government in Baghdad would
be expected to maintain strong economic ties with Jordan. Such an
important U.S. ally in the Middle East would not be allowed to
founder, said Patrick Clawson, deputy director for the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy. "At the end of the day, the U.S. will
find a way to help Jordan through its difficulties," he said.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>AMMAN, Jordan</DL>
<LD>Four people were killed and scores injured in clashes in the southern
Jordanian city of Maan during a major government sweep to round up
Islamic activists, witnesses and officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said heavy gunfire broke out at dawn between hundreds of
masked, armed youths and police after security forces stormed the
city, allegedly to search for militants linked to the killing of a
U.S. diplomat last month.</LD>
<LD>   The state-run Petra news agency quoted an official source as
saying four people had died -- three gunmen "who had opened fire at
security forces" and one police officer. It said another police
officer was seriously wounded.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses said scores of people were wounded by gunfire and rushed
to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on state television, Interior Minister Qaftan Majali
accused "armed outlaw groups" of being behind the clashes. He said
people from other Arab countries were among those arrested with
ammunition and automatic weapons in their possession. He did not
elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities cut telephone lines to Maan on Sunday, and the city of
40,000 was under curfew, with all government offices and schools
closed, witnesses and residents said.</TE>
<TE>   "Heavy gunfire can be heard across the city," one resident said by
phone.</TE>
<TE>   One official said the crackdown was aimed at those who might
foment unrest or carry out sabotage in the event of a U.S. war
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Islamic Action Front, the country's largest opposition party,
issued a statement warning the government not to risk "an escalation
in the situation and widening of its repercussions" that could
endanger national security at a time of looming war.</TE>

<HD>Kuwaitis Recant Confessions in Marine's Death</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KUWAIT CITY</DL>
<LD>Six Kuwaiti men held in the fatal shooting of a U.S. Marine last
month have told a judge that they confessed to involvement under
duress, their lawyer said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The six said they had nothing to do with the Oct. 8 attack by two
Muslim fundamentalists but had to confess because they were beaten or
"mistreated" by police, said attorney Najib Wugayyan. Police
officials were not immediately available for comment.</LD>
<LD>   The suspects have not been charged but were questioned Saturday by
a judge to decide whether they should be released on bail. He ruled
that their detention should be extended.</LD>
<TE>   Five of the six men are relatives of Anas Kandari, one of the two
attackers who shot at the Marines while they trained on a Kuwaiti
island. One Marine was killed before other Marines shot the two
attackers dead.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Kandari had sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden.</TE>

<HD>Gun Attack Kills 5 Israelis at Kibbutz</HD>
<DH>The community was targeted in an earlier foiled suicide
bombing, officials say. The army strikes Gaza City in retaliation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>At least one suspected Palestinian gunman infiltrated a remote
Israeli kibbutz just across the border from the West Bank late
Sunday, killing at least five people, wounding three others and
setting off a massive nighttime manhunt by Israeli troops using
search dogs and helicopters, witnesses and officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Flares lighted the sky as hundreds of police and soldiers scoured
the low hills around Kibbutz Metzer in northern Israel, but the
attacker or attackers escaped. Earlier in the day, the kibbutz was
the scene of an intercepted car bombing that killed two Palestinian
men when their vehicle exploded.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli retaliation for the shooting was swift. Two hours after
the attack on the collective farm, helicopters launched an airstrike
on Gaza City before dawn today, firing rockets into the downtown area
near the Mediterranean seaside.</LD>
<TE>   Kibbutz Metzer lies near the Green Line separating Israel from the
West Bank, not far from the Palestinian town of Tulkarm, which has
often served as a staging ground for attacks during more than two
years of intense Israeli-Palestinian violence.</TE>
<TE>   Infiltrations by Palestinian militants of Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip have become common during the fighting,
but Sunday's attack was one of the worst in memory against a kibbutz
inside Israel proper.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman, who authorities said probably had an accomplice,
slipped into the community shortly after midnight and fired at a
family inside their home and at residents leaving the communal dining
hall after a late supper, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Other residents, who recently held a drill on how to cope with
such an attack, huddled in their homes as the gunfire rang out. A
woman who identified herself only as Irit told Israeli radio that the
shooting went on for about 10 minutes before security forces arrived.</TE>
<TE>   The district police chief, Yaakov Borovsky, told Israeli radio
that based on the number and timing of the shots fired, it was
believed that there was more than one assailant.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia linked to Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, claimed
responsibility for the shooting in telephone calls to Western news
agencies. However, it is not unusual for more than one militant group
to claim responsibility for the same attack.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials said they suspected that the shooting might have
been the work of the same militants who had sent a fully primed car
bomb across the border from the West Bank and into Israel earlier in
the day. The vehicle blew up when border police tried to stop it on a
road near the kibbutz.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear whether the powerful bomb was accidentally set
off by the car's two occupants or whether they deliberately triggered
it when they realized they would not be able to reach their target.
The blast reduced the car to a charred wreck.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion was one of three foiled suicide bombings Sunday,
including one attempt by a 15-year-old boy who was captured in the
West Bank city of Nablus as he set off on a bombing mission, Israeli
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Another case involved a senior activist from the militant group
Hamas, who was arrested overnight in the volatile West Bank city of
Hebron. Israeli officials said he had masterminded an imminent bomb
plot.</TE>
<TE>   Also Sunday, despite multiple warnings of possible attacks, the
army eased its grip on the West Bank city of Jenin, lifting a tight
curfew for the first full day since Oct. 25. Families flocked to
markets to shop for provisions for the holy month of Ramadan, and
bulldozers began clearing away debris.</TE>
<TE>   The partial troop pullback came a day after the killing in Jenin
of an Islamic Jihad leader blamed by Israel for some of the most
deadly bombings of recent months. Iyad Sawalha, the commander of the
group's military operations in the northern West Bank, was killed
Saturday in an exchange of gunfire after Israeli troops tracked him
to a house on the edge of the casbah, or old city, and uncovered the
hidden chamber he was holed up in.</TE>
<TE>   The clampdown on Jenin came only days after a bus bombing in
northern Israel that killed 14 people and that Israel said was
orchestrated by Sawalha and his Islamic Jihad cell.</TE>
<TE>   Today's predawn rocket attack in Gaza City touched off a raging
fire, witnesses said. They said the target appeared to be a building
they described as an auto-parts shop, believed to be empty at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli army spokesman said one of two air force helicopters
used in the attack fired four missiles at the shop, suspected of
housing an arms factory.</TE>
<TE>   The kibbutz attack was the most serious strike at Israelis since a
shakeup late last month in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon, after the collapse of his parliamentary alliance with the
Labor Party.</TE>
<TE>   The restyled Cabinet includes Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz, who as
army chief of staff oversaw the use of drastic military measures in
the West Bank and Gaza in response to attacks, and Foreign Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who also takes a tougher stance than Sharon
toward the Palestinians.</TE>

<HD>Disarming Iraq Not as Easy as It Sounds, Intelligence
Analysts Say</HD>
<DH>Baghdad may cooperate with inspectors just enough to muddy
the waters and make it difficult for the U.S. to justify a military
attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A dozen years after Iraq's invasion of little oil-rich Kuwait, the
endgame over the future of Saddam Hussein's regime has finally begun.</LD>
<LD>   Or has it?</LD>
<LD>   The international haggling is over. A new U.N. resolution on Iraq
passed Friday, and weapons inspectors soon could be heading back to
Baghdad. The Bush administration is pushing and planning for a speedy
denouement that will either yield any weapons of mass destruction
Iraq might possess or spark war to find and destroy them.</LD>
<TE>   Yet a growing chorus of former weapons inspectors, intelligence
analysts and Iraq experts warns that disarming Baghdad could drag on
quite possibly beyond the preferred timing for a U.S. military
operation in the cooler winter months.</TE>
<TE>   In what could prove to be the administration's worst-case
scenario, the Iraqi regime may comply at least at the outset, the
sources predict. Hussein may even allow U.N. teams entry into eight
palace compounds, access he long restricted on grounds of Iraqi
sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   "We are setting ourselves up for a big confrontation. We'll try
in-your-face hard-line inspections assuming the Iraqis won't
cooperate. But Saddam will meet them with all kinds of fluffy-stuff
public demonstrations, opening the palaces to the Iraqi people and
other creative ploys to distract attention and make the whole thing
look silly, hoping to throw the inspections off course," said Judith
Yaphe, a former intelligence analyst now at the National Defense
University in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time the inspectors get in, there'll be nothing to look
for in the palaces they want to check," she said. "That will be the
pattern over and over again, wherever the inspectors go."</TE>
<TE>   How the showdown unfolds will be keyed to both deadlines and
performance. But despite the unprecedented pressures and demands on
him, Hussein still holds many cards, U.N. and U.S. officials concede.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be easier for him to string out the process beyond
the administration's [informal] deadline and harder for the United
States to find a trigger mechanism to act militarily," said Phebe
Marr, an Iraq expert and former U.S. government analyst. "We've
already been slowed just in getting a U.N. resolution."</TE>
<TE>   The first test will be the Friday deadline for Iraq to accept the
new U.N. resolution. Many analysts both inside and outside government
expect Hussein to agree.</TE>
<TE>   "With Saddam, it's always been about one thing: survival. He wants
to stay in power, and he'll do what it takes to keep it, even when he
doesn't want to," said Whitley Bruner, a former U.S. intelligence
official who served in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   As it has in the past, Baghdad may at first fuss and fume before
submitting to this new, tougher round of inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "The resolution is a declaration of war against Iraq. It
undermines the basic principles of the U.N. Charter. It also
undermines all the earlier Security Council resolutions about Iraq,"
Foreign Minister Naji Sabri told CNN nearly two weeks before the
resolution passed.</TE>
<TE>   The real test will be the 30-day deadline for handing over a
complete list of any Iraqi nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
and ballistic missiles. Baghdad was supposed to provide such a list
within 15 days of the Persian Gulf War's end in 1991, but it still
hadn't complied by the time the weapons inspectors withdrew in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has insisted for months that it has nothing left to declare,
one reason the U.S. pushed hard for the U.N. to make lying or failing
to fully declare any of its deadliest arms a "material breach" on
Iraq's part that could justify military action.</TE>
<TE>   Coming clean will be tough. But again, several former weapons
inspectors and Iraq experts predict that Baghdad is likely in the end
to confirm that it still has weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the 1991 cease-fire, Iraq initially gave up roughly a
third of its weapons, hoping the U.N. teams would soon go away. They
didn't. In the mid-1990s, Iraq again admitted it still had some
weaponry, after claiming to be clean, a move forced by the defection
of Hussein's son-in-law, who managed programs to develop weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   As a stalling tactic, however, all Iraq has to do is confess to a
few arms, perhaps a few token Scud missiles, and some of the
"dual-use" programs that can make chemical or biological weapons out
of everyday ingredients, analysts and former weapons inspectors say.
That could muddy the waters and lead to further splits in the
international community.</TE>
<TE>   "If Iraq coughs up some of the stuff, particularly real biological
and chemical weapons, then the United States is in trouble. It'll be
very difficult for the administration to say it still may launch a
war. We couldn't justify this even to the Brits," Bruner said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many in the administration who are concerned that's
exactly what Saddam will do," he said. "Their position is that the
United States can't afford to take yes for an answer."</TE>
<TE>   Because the outside world is still unsure of exactly what Hussein
does have, the inspectors will need time to determine whether his
regime is still hiding an arsenal, analysts and former inspectors
say.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's initial revelation might be greeted by many in Europe and
the Arab world as proof that the inspections are working and that war
is avoidable, the sources say.</TE>
<TE>   Then come the tricky and labor-intensive inspections. They will
involve a nationwide hunt through hundreds of potential dual-use
facilities, from government sites to university labs, hospitals to
industrial areas, and including breweries and baby milk plants.
Breweries, for example, could have "growth media" to produce
biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know where he's hiding his arms. There are more than 700
sites just to begin looking," said Kenneth M. Pollack, former
national security staffer for the Clinton and current Bush
administrations and author of "The Threatening Storm: The Case for
Invading Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Merely working up what is known as a "baseline" of all the
facilities to check, and then setting up monitors to ensure they will
not later be converted for weapons manufacturing, could take four to
five months, say former inspectors who spent a year working up the
initial baseline for the last round of inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Running surprise inspections along the way will be the hardest
part, because surprises are almost impossible to pull off in
Hussein's tightly controlled nation.</TE>
<TE>   Without major new arms discoveries, Baghdad is likely to argue
that there's nothing more to find and begin pressing for an end to
the inspections and the lifting of the world's toughest economic
sanctions. Iraq could find sympathy from key U.N. Security Council
members such as France and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam will look for one round of inspections where nothing is
found, and then he'll want an end to everything imposed on him since
the Gulf War ended," said Yaphe, the analyst.</TE>
<TE>   But two wild cards could entrap Hussein. One is his own strategy.
"Saddam is different from other enemies -- leaders in the Soviet
Union, for example. He's reckless. He miscalculates," Pollack said.</TE>
<TE>   If the Iraqi leader had complied with the U.N. in 1991, he
probably would not have faced long-term sanctions or forfeited 11
years of oil revenue totaling more than $300 billion, which he could
have used to rebuild his weapons programs, Iraq experts point out.</TE>
<TE>   The other wild card is that intelligence might exist or be found
that pinpoints hiding places for mobile Scud missile launchers, data
and equipment for a nuclear program, and chemical and biological
inventories and labs, all of which the U.S. believes Hussein still
has.</TE>
<TE>   Although this is the key to fully disarming Iraq, U.S. and U.N.
officials admit that intelligence is the weakest link in the process.</TE>
<TE>   The only sure intelligence bet is finding Iraqi scientists,
engineers and other technicians in the programs willing to talk. An
estimated 500 to 600 are believed to be involved, according to U.S.
and U.N. officials.</TE>
<TE>   A demand in the U.N. resolution calls for inspectors to have the
right to take Iraqis and their families outside Iraq for interviews
about weapons programs. It survived last-minute cuts, but chief U.N.
weapons inspector Hans Blix says it will be "impractical" and
possibly illegal to implement.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the last-minute scramble to patch over deep differences among
U.N. members, U.S. officials admitted that a new resolution was only
the beginning of a long process and no guarantee. Conceded a
well-placed U.S. official, "It'll take a lot more than a tough U.N.
resolution to disarm Saddam. But you've got to start somewhere."</TE>

<HD>Astronauts Return From Mission to International Station</HD>
<DH>Crew of two Russians and a Belgian cites good working
relations, but financial problems threaten the program's global
partnership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>A joint Russian-Belgian crew returned to Earth on Sunday after
delivering an upgraded Soyuz TMA-1 spacecraft to the International
Space Station, where the vehicle will serve as a lifeboat in case of
emergency.</LD>
<LD>   The 12-day mission -- originally scheduled to include American
singer Lance Bass from the pop group 'N Sync as a corporate-sponsored
space tourist -- came amid concerns about how budget cuts in the
Russian space program may affect the station's operations.</LD>
<LD>   Bass, who underwent training for the journey, would have been the
world's third space tourist, for a reported fee of $20 million. His
backers had planned to produce a TV miniseries documenting the
preparations and the flight, but they failed to come up with the
money in time.</LD>
<TE>   Russian space officials hoped that such paying passengers would
help keep their program going.</TE>
<TE>   Belgium's Crown Prince Philippe flew to Kazakhstan to greet flight
commander Sergei Zaletin, engineer Yuri Lonchakov and Belgian
engineer Frank de Winne, who said they felt fine despite a
bumpier-than-usual nighttime landing.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good. The flight went normally," De Winne told reporters
at the site in Russian. "We fulfilled all the scientific programs."</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with Russia's space traditions, the crew members left
their autographs on the Soyuz capsule, which was charred from the
heat of reentry.</TE>
<TE>   The three also bantered and praised one another for the media.</TE>
<TE>   Lonchakov noted that De Winne had learned Russian in six months.</TE>
<TE>   De Winne said the Russian crew was "very helpful and attentive" to
him on his first space voyage. "This is why the whole flight went so
well," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I will be brief," Zaletin responded. "I will now fly only with
Frank."</TE>
<TE>   This is the sort of international friendship that the space
station program is supposed to encourage, yet the financial problems
it has run into sometimes promote bickering among the partners.</TE>
<TE>   Under a 1996 agreement with NASA, the Russian Aviation and Space
Agency must replace the three-person Soyuz escape craft attached to
the station approximately every six months, as its batteries begin to
run out.</TE>
<TE>   The new, improved model delivered by the latest flight boasts
about 40 pieces of upgraded equipment and more comfortable seats that
can accommodate bigger astronauts.</TE>
<TE>   Russian space officials said last month, however, that they might
not have enough money next year to meet their Soyuz commitments,
which extend to 2006. After that, the United States is supposed to
provide the emergency escape vehicle, but a NASA prototype, the
seven-person X-38, was canceled as too costly. A proposed small
orbital space plane, which would be launched by rocket, is considered
unlikely to be available before 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Until NASA has something ready, Soyuz craft are the only lifeboat
alternative. The U.S. shuttle can dock at the station but can stay
there only up to two weeks, primarily because it lacks solar
batteries and requires a lot of power, said Sergei K. Gromov, a
spokesman for Energiya Design Bureau, the corporation that designs
the Soyuz.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has expressed a willingness to provide more Soyuz craft --
even two at a time -- if NASA is willing to pay a reported asking
price of $65 million per craft.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that for the time being, NASA could pay for the use of
a second Soyuz," a Russian space official, who spoke on condition he
not be further identified, said Sunday. "But this suggestion was not
accepted by our partners."</TE>
<TE>   NASA officials have said some sort of deal for the continued
supply of Soyuz craft after 2006 is likely to be worked out because
that is the only way to continuously have crews on the orbiting
station.</TE>
<TE>   The financial issue will be discussed at a December meeting of the
heads of the U.S., Russian, European, Japanese and Canadian space
agencies cooperating in the project, said Sergei A. Gorbunov, a
spokesman for the Russian agency.</TE>

<HD>Not Such an Inflated Notion</HD>
<DH>The Pentagon believes that giant unmanned blimps, hovering
high above U.S. borders, could be key to the nation's defense.</DH>

<LD>It has been 65 years since the ill-fated Hindenburg burst into flames
and deflated the chances that lighter-than-air ships would become
anything more than a curious footnote in aviation history. Except for
the limited use of the Goodyear blimp as a flying billboard, dozens
of efforts to revive the glory of dirigibles have fallen flat.</LD>
<LD>   But now, Pentagon officials believe that airships could play a
crucial role in protecting the United States from attack. They have
quietly asked the country's largest defense contractors to develop
giant unmanned craft -- two to three times as big as Goodyear's
gasbag -- that would ring the continent. Hovering high in the
stratosphere, beyond the reach of unfriendly forces, such blimps
would be used to spot incoming enemy missiles and planes.</LD>
<LD>   The airships would be far more complicated than any built before,
and it could take seven or eight years before they are deployed. But
Pentagon and industry officials say technological advances, including
highly efficient solar cells, make them optimistic that the giant
blimps can be added to the U.S. arsenal.</LD>
<TE>   "We are very excited about high-altitude airships," Sue Payton,
the Pentagon's deputy undersecretary for advanced systems and
concepts, said in a recent briefing with industry executives,
according to a transcript. She added that airships have become a
high-priority technology demonstration program for the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The effort gained momentum a couple of weeks ago when the Missile
Defense Agency, charged with protecting the country from ballistic
missiles, officially launched a competition to develop a
high-altitude, helium-filled airship. It said such blimps should be
capable of floating for months at an altitude of 70,000 feet,
carrying more than 4,000 pounds of unspecified payload.</TE>
<TE>   Defense contractors have until February to submit their designs,
and the agency expects to award a contract in March to one or more
winning firms to build a prototype airship within three years. The
goal is to deploy an operational system by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials are cagey about how the blimps would be used
and how much they would cost, but several federal agencies also want
to use the airships, including the White House Office of Homeland
Security, a spokesman for the missile defense agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Since last year's terrorist attacks, homeland security officials
have been stepping up calls for improving surveillance of suspected
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   At the recent industry briefing, Pentagon officials described one
scenario in which at least 10 massive airships equipped with radar
and other sensors would be used to track incoming ballistic and
cruise missiles while also monitoring potential terrorist activities
on the ground, according to people who attended the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The airships would rim the U.S. coastline, starting from the Puget
Sound area in the Northwest, down the Pacific coast and then up the
Atlantic coast to Maine. Each airship could carry 40-foot rotating
radars with a footprint of about 750 miles, according to a defense
industry official.</TE>
<TE>   The airships, at least initially, would not carry weapons,
although eventually they could be equipped with chemical lasers to
shoot down ballistic missiles.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some challenges to overcome, but it just looks like a
concept whose time has come," said Ron Browning, director of business
development for Lockheed Martin Corp.'s Naval Electronics &amp;
Surveillance Systems unit, which has been working on a high-altitude
airship for three years.</TE>
<TE>   Even longtime critics of missile defense systems are intrigued by
the concept.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that there is anything evidently preposterous about
it," said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a think tank.
"While it may feel early 20th century, it would be wrong to suggest
that the airship was completely discredited by the Hindenburg, which
was a different airship in almost every respect than what you are
seeing now."</TE>
<TE>   Other Pentagon agencies, including the Army and the Navy, are
keenly interested in the next-generation airship for tactical uses,
analysts said. The helium-filled contraptions could be deployed in
conflicts overseas, monitoring enemy troop movements and even
carrying laser designators to provide targeting information for
cruise missiles and so-called smart bombs. At 70,000 feet, they would
be too high for most antiaircraft missiles.</TE>
<TE>   At least 10 companies are expected to compete to build the
airships, including the world's largest aerospace companies --
Lockheed Martin, Boeing Co. and Raytheon Corp. -- as well as smaller
firms such as AeroVironment Inc. The pioneering Monrovia aircraft
developer built the highest-flying unmanned, solar-powered airplane.</TE>
<TE>   Using airships for battle is nothing new, and in fact much of the
last two centuries of developing lighter-than-air vehicles has
focused on their use in surveillance and reconnaissance.</TE>
<TE>   Balloons were used as aerial observation posts during the Civil
War, and Germans used rigid airships to drop bombs on England during
World War I. Use of airships for transportation was hurt by the 1937
Hindenburg disaster, in which the hydrogen-filled German dirigible
burst into flames while landing at Lakehurst, N.J., killing 35 people
on board. Since then, airships have mainly used nonexplosive helium.</TE>
<TE>   For World War II history buffs, the idea of floating airships for
defense is reminiscent of the hundreds of tethered blimps that
hovered above London to obstruct German bombers and rockets. Locally,
massive blimps regularly patrolled the coastline looking for Japanese
submarines during the war. The region's blimp heritage still is
visible at the defunct Tustin Marine Air Station, where two gigantic
hangars that used to house them still tower over the Orange County
horizon.</TE>
<TE>   And it wouldn't be the first time that the Pentagon has looked at
airships for strategic purposes. In the 1950s, the Navy built four
dirigibles to hover near the Arctic Circle watching for Soviet
bombers. These were retired in 1962 after satellites and stronger
ground-based radar systems took hold.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1980s, the Air Force has operated 11 low-altitude
aerostats -- small, tethered blimps -- around the U.S.-Mexican
border, mainly to spot low-flying aircraft used by drug smugglers.
But these low-tech blimps are not nearly as sophisticated as what the
Pentagon now envisions.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon's renewed interest in airships has been driven by
developments in solar power and unmanned technologies that are
opening the possibility of putting blimps in the stratosphere, a
long-sought goal of engineers since the Wright brothers' first
powered flight nearly a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   At 70,000 feet, the aircraft would be perched above the jet stream
and adverse weather. Winds are calm enough that the airships could
stay in geostationary positions, hovering over a specific site for
months on end. They would need to come down only to replenish their
helium, which over time would leak through the airships' skin.</TE>
<TE>   At that height, sensors that have been perfected for satellites
would be as much as 50 times more sensitive than if they were in
space, providing highly detailed images. Radar also would be able to
spot low-flying aircraft and cruise missiles that may have escaped
detection by ground-based systems.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest trick, perhaps, has been figuring out how to keep such
airships aloft at 70,000 feet; the air at that altitude is so thin
that most aircraft would have difficulty staying up. But this
challenge is starting to be overcome, industry officials said.
Lighter material for the skin, such as Kevlar, and other advances are
bringing high- altitude airships closer to reality.</TE>
<TE>   The airship envisioned by Lockheed, for one, would be controlled
by four electric propellers. Lightweight solar cells could provide
power to the giant blimp for months.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Pike, who first saw the military experimenting with
high-altitude balloons 30 years ago, said interest in airships has
climbed and fallen with the nation's insecurities.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Sept. 11, you've got new requirements. And every time
you've got a novel set of requirements, the whole technology gets a
new look," Pike said, noting how the balloons he long ago witnessed
led to a rash of calls about unidentified flying objects. Airships,
he said, "sort of move in and out of fashion."</TE>

<HD>No Rap on Eminem: He Gets His Shot, His Opportunity, and
Doesn't Let It Slip</HD>
<DH>Record labels trying to duplicate Eminem's cross-racial
success are finding it difficult to make a connection with rap
audiences.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hey there's a concept that works / 20 million other white rappers emerge /
But no matter how many fish in the sea / It'd be so empty without me</LD>
<LD> -- from "Without Me," by Eminem</LD>
<LD>   Rapper Eminem's lyrics exaggerate the number, but the best-selling
solo rap artist in history crisply captures the music industry's
quest to copy his cross-racial success.</LD>
<TE>   Record labels have spent a small fortune signing about half a
dozen white rappers with names such as Tow Down, Genovese and Hot
Karl. Undoubtedly more will be coming with the smash debut last
weekend of Eminem's loosely biographical movie "8 Mile."</TE>
<TE>   But the road ahead for these aspiring stars probably will be a
dead end, much as it has been for others who already have tried the
trip to the top of the charts.</TE>
<TE>   Tow Down and Genovese, for example, have been dumped by their
record labels. Hot Karl ended his contract after his label refused to
release the album he recorded.</TE>
<TE>   "A white rapper has to work under a much finer microscope in a
very competitive field. If the black audience isn't with it, it's not
going to happen," said Elektra Entertainment Group Chairwoman Sylvia
Rhone, the only African American woman to run a major record label.</TE>
<TE>   It's not surprising that labels would try to replicate Eminem's
success. In the entertainment business, if a concept works once, it's
assumed that it will work to wearying excess. That's true whether the
medium is film, TV or music.</TE>
<TE>   Record labels saw Eminem's sales and said, " 'Oh, a white rapper
can make money. Let's get our own white rapper,' " said Stephen Hill,
vice president for music programming at TV channel Black
Entertainment Television. What they didn't see, he said, was that the
controversial singer was not a novelty like early white rappers
Vanilla Ice and Mark Wahlberg, whose music careers quickly flamed
out. In contrast, he said, Eminem is "a person with an amazing
ability to connect with his audience."</TE>
<TE>   That connection is so powerful and unique that the 30-year-old
Detroit rapper was able to transcend the roots of the genre, no small
feat for a white speed rhymer.</TE>
<TE>   Rap began more than two decades ago as an art form among urban
blacks confronted with poverty and discrimination. Since then, its
appeal has spread to young music fans of all colors who embrace the
fiercely rebellious nature of the lyrics and wrap themselves in the
grittiness of a life that may or may not resemble their own. Record
industry surveys have consistently found that about 75% of rap music
is purchased by U.S. white, Latino and Asian consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Even with an overall slump in the music industry, rap remains a
commercial and cultural power, generating an estimated $1.6 billion
in domestic record sales. Eminem's three albums -- filled with lyrics
that critics call misogynistic and homophobic -- have sold 19.8
million copies in the U.S. That's more than rap's other biggest
stars, including the late Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg or Jay-Z. Eminem's
latest album, "The Eminem Show," is expected to be the top-selling
record of the year, and the soundtrack from "8 Mile" entered the pop
chart last week at No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Just five years ago, Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers,
was searching for credibility by competing in rap contests and
circulating recordings of his clever, penetrating and, at times,
hostile riffs. While growing up, he had been influenced by such acts
as the Beastie Boys, a white rap act that achieved a degree of street
credibility in part by touring with rap trailblazers Run-DMC.</TE>
<TE>   The credibility Eminem needed with black audiences came from Dr.
Dre, the acclaimed record producer and rapper, who had been handed
one of Eminem's demos. Dre began touting Mathers as his protege and
produced three tracks on his breakthrough album, "The Slim Shady LP."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of cultural entree also has benefited the only other
white rapper to make a respectable, albeit modest, run at rap radio
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Rapper Bubba Sparxxx, born Warren Anderson Mathis, had the backing
of a celebrated rap producer, Timbaland. He stewarded the Georgia
rapper's CD and appeared in Sparxxx's first video, which received
heavy play on MTV and featured the burly newcomer with farm boys
wrestling pigs.</TE>
<TE>   The album, "Dark Days, Bright Nights," has sold 600,000 copies, a
fair showing for a new artist, but well below the projection of his
label, Interscope Records, which also releases Eminem's albums.
Sparxxx's second CD is due out early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Without the support of rap's biggest names, the odds of failure
are high for white rappers, who must still have the skills to win
fans on rap radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   Hot Karl was a USC communications major who planned to write movie
scripts when he was signed by Interscope. The rapper, whose real name
is Jensen-Gerard Karp, was raised in Calabasas and decided to pursue
a music career after winning a local radio station contest in which
he called in each day and ad-libbed a few rhymes.</TE>
<TE>   Hot Karl, who keeps his hair spiky and wears black-rimmed glasses,
said Interscope paid him a five-figure advance, plus $3,500 a month
for living expenses. Interscope spent an estimated $400,000 to record
Hot Karl's first album, in which he raps about Los Angeles nightclubs
and pokes fun at gangsta rap and auction Web site EBay.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, after six months of waiting for the release of his
album and the anticipated promotional campaign that would catapult
him to stardom, Karl began to press label executives. When they told
him the record wasn't ready, he asked to part ways.</TE>
<TE>   Hot Karl, 23, said he recently signed a six-figure contract with
record conglomerate EMI to write songs for himself and others. But
Karl doesn't see himself taking center stage soon. Although labels
routinely sign hot prospects only to drop them, Karl believes that
other artists are given a better shot at success because the record
companies are willing to show more patience.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like white rappers have to do it off the first single,"
Karl said. "The bar is so high, and if you don't come up to the bar,
you don't have a career.... I wasn't really given the chance."
Executives at Interscope declined to comment</TE>
<TE>   Houston rapper Tow Down, whose real name is Bryan Theriot, has
been trying to build a following for years.</TE>
<TE>   Flavoring his raps with references to stylish cars, marijuana and
country-western culture, Tow Down developed as a local hit in
Houston's rap circles. He sometimes promoted his music by dropping in
unannounced on radio disc jockeys broadcasting from other performers'
concerts. Two years ago, he began persuading stations in Tyler,
Texas, and Shreveport, La., to play one of the songs from an album he
had recorded on his brother's tiny independent label.</TE>
<TE>   On an earlier collection, produced by his brother, Tow Down was
part of a trio of white rappers who tried to downplay their race by
placing a photo of three middle-aged black men on their album cover.</TE>
<TE>   The airplay on his solo record caught the attention of a talent
scout at Elektra.</TE>
<TE>   "When they found out I was white, it was like, 'Fly up here
tomorrow and come hang out with us,' " Tow Down said.</TE>
<TE>   Elektra flew him and three friends to New York, picked them up in
a limousine and got them into the MTV Video Music Awards, he
recalled. He soon signed a deal to release a single from his "By
Prescription Only" album through Elektra, which made superstars of
such rap artists as Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes.</TE>
<TE>   Elektra spent an estimated $250,000 to film a Tow Down music video
-- featuring him behind the wheel of an orange Mercedes modeled on a
car from the "Dukes of Hazzard" TV show -- and to fly him to meet
radio programmers at a Miami convention.</TE>
<TE>   But the relationship quickly soured. Rap radio programmers didn't
like the song and the label seemed to lose interest. Tow Down
recalled that a label executive once called and left a message
inquiring how "Low Down" was doing. Elektra soon notified Tow Down
that it would not release the album.</TE>
<TE>   "Some things connect, and some things don't. Unfortunately, this
didn't," said Elektra's chairwoman, Rhone.</TE>
<TE>   Tow Down is still living off his Elektra advance and is busy
performing back at his Houston haunts. One of his latest songs
accuses the staff of his former label of being "amateurs" who subsist
on sales of the decades-old Eagles catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Like Interscope, Universal Records also made a run at developing a
white rapper -- New York-based Genovese.</TE>
<TE>   A rap fan since the fifth grade, Genovese performed at clubs and
appeared on tapes circulated in New York's rap underground. But it
wasn't until a few months after Eminem's 1999 debut, Genovese said,
that a major label expressed interest.</TE>
<TE>   Universal paid the Yonkers performer a five-figure advance and
spent more than $200,000 on marketing and a music video shot in New
York's Little Italy, playing off of Genovese's Italian roots. Label
executives also introduced him to East Coast radio programmers and
pitched him to rap magazines.</TE>
<TE>   The first song from Genovese's "My America" album garnered modest
airplay in various markets, including Phoenix. But based on the tepid
early response, Universal decided not to release the album.</TE>
<TE>   "You come so far, and then you get sent back," said the
26-year-old rapper, whose full name is Joseph Genovese. "I still
haven't gotten a shot." Today, as he tries for another record deal,
Genovese performs in local music clubs. He recently appeared at a
theater in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt Genovese was a tremendous talent. And we're frustrated
the marketplace didn't respond better," said Universal Records
President Monte Lipman, who took the helm after Genovese was signed.
"At the end of the day, people respond to music. People don't buy
Eminem because he's a white rapper. People buy Eminem because he
makes great music."</TE>

<HD>Pilots Win O.C.'s Battle of the Banners</HD>
<DH>Huntington Beach backs down from its ordinance regulating
advertising flights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Dobry may be the most watched airplane pilot in Southern
California. For nearly two decades, he has flown above crowded
beaches, parade routes and even the World Series, towing banners that
hawk everything from fish tacos to the L.A. Kings.</LD>
<LD>   But until the city of Huntington Beach tried to restrict his
banner-towing business -- complaining it was noisy and a visual
blight -- Dobry was a fairly anonymous businessman, an unseen pilot
hauling messages seen by thousands up and down the coastline.</LD>
<LD>   "Noisy? My airplane?" said Dobry, a bulldog of a man with
brush-cut hair. "If we were at the Huntington Beach Pier we would
only hear a hum as one of our planes went by, compared to
motorcycles, trucks and the pounding surf, which are a lot noisier."</LD>
<TE>   Dobry and others who live off aerial advertising found their
business lives in jeopardy after a federal appeals court in January
upheld Honolulu's right to ban banner-towing airplanes, opening the
gate for other cities to ground banner businesses. Feeling it had the
ammunition it needed, Huntington Beach passed its own ban last
summer.</TE>
<TE>   But before Huntington Beach could enact the ban, an anti-abortion
group sued the city, contending the ban violated its 1st Amendment
rights by depriving it of the right to have its messages dragged
through the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration made it clear that
it -- not cities such as Huntington Beach -- has full authority over
airspace. The FAA said it wanted to clarify ambiguous statements in
its handbook that may "have been misinterpreted" to recognize the
ability of state and local governments to regulate banner-towing.</TE>
<TE>   "The FAA maintains that we have the authority to administer
airspace control," said Jerry Snyder, an FAA spokesman in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Huntington Beach plans to repeal its ban at a Nov. 18
meeting. And Dobry can fly again without fear.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed," said Huntington Beach Councilwoman Connie
Boardman, who pushed for the ban. "It just killed me to vote to put
it on our agenda to repeal, but the legal reality is we don't have an
enforceable item."</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, the city got trumped by the FAA," said an upbeat Dobry.
"Game over."</TE>
<TE>   The FAA clarification deletes a requirement that operators of
banner-towing planes "acquire knowledge of state and local ordinances
that may prohibit or restrict banner-towing operations," Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   Honolulu has yet to react to the FAA's position that it has the
authority to police the skies, said Lorrie Chee, a Honolulu
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   For Dobry, it's been a tough 18 months. His company, Aerial
Promotions Inc., based at Long Beach Airport was closed for nearly
five months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks when the government
cleared the air of civilian aircraft like his. And he was grounded
again for four weeks on the one-year anniversary of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been tough on the pocketbook," Dobry said. The threatened
ban hardly lifted his spirits, or his bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   At 47, Dobry has spent a career inside a cockpit and has flown
4,000 hours towing banners. His dad, an aircraft assembler for
McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach, first interested him in aviation
with model airplanes as a young boy, and "I've been hooked ever
since."</TE>
<TE>   He has eight airplanes and 14 pilots. Ground crewman Sareth Toch
also paints and sews the nylon banners that weigh 60 pounds and are
36 feet tall and 100 feet long.</TE>
<TE>   With an estimated 25 banner airplanes operating in Southern
California, Dobry's operation is one of the largest. He declined to
provide rates, but banner advertising companies earn an average of
$500 to $2,500 a day.</TE>
<TE>   They fly small airplanes, usually two-seater Bellanca Scouts,
known more for utility than beauty. When towing, the craft putter
along at about 40 mph, typically 500 feet over the ocean or 1,000
feet over land, under FAA rules.</TE>
<TE>   Other than taking off and then snagging the banner, it's pretty
boring work because of the low speed, pilots admit. But aviators are
always in search of ways to log flight time and get paid for it, said
Joel S. Warner, one of Dobry's pilots, who lives in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "None of my neighbors have ever complained about the banners. But
they do complain about those noisy police helicopters," Warner said.
"I personally thought the city's ban was a folly because of the FAA's
control over airspace. To me, this ordinance [was] not worthy of the
council's time."</TE>
<TE>   Warner said he loves to fly and enjoys the precision it takes to
snag banners at the airport. During a recent flight, Warner circled
the airport and unceremoniously tossed a grappling hook connected to
a tow line from the cockpit window. Then he took the craft down to 15
feet while flying about 90 mph.</TE>
<TE>   His target: two tall poles about 30 feet apart with a towline
stretched across, resembling a goal post. The rolled-up banner was
350 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   Warner maneuvered the plane between the two posts as the hook
snagged the towline. Immediately, Warner pushed the throttle forward
and yanked the joystick back, sending the plane into a 60-degree
climb to more than 400 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to do that to get as much lift as quick as possible," said
Dobry, who observed Warner's snag approvingly.</TE>
<TE>   As the plane leveled, an American flag unfurled, and Warner spent
an hour over the Pacific near the Queen Mary.</TE>
<TE>   On the return flight, Warner flew above the goal posts and pulled
a lever that disengaged the towline. The banner quietly fell to
earth.</TE>
<TE>   "You call that noisy? And that City Council thinks we're
dangerous?" Dobry said. "Well, let me ask you this: Are they pilots?"</TE>
<TE>   Dobry didn't speak out against the ban, though he had much to lose
if it was implemented. The legal challenge came from the Center for
Bio-Ethical Reform in Santa Fe Springs. Dobry is not affiliated with
the group. He said he wouldn't fly a banner that portrayed a dead
fetus over a large sporting event like the World Series because the
image "is inappropriate" for the venue.</TE>
<TE>   However, the anti-abortion group is making plans to step up its
marketing program by flying more banners, not only along the Southern
California coast but also in Honolulu, said Gregg Cunningham, the
group's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham's group has learned a valuable lesson. The banners
work. They paid $100,000 for airplanes to tow their message during
the summer and have received so much response they're considering
buying their own airplane to fly their banner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cheap," Cunningham said. "And beats television for
marketing."</TE>

<HD>'Got Name' Is Town's Answer to Offer by Milk Promoter</HD>
<DH>Tiny Biggs passes on the chance to become Got Milk?, the
poster community for dairy board. The search continues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gabriel Friedman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>BIGGS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>There may someday be a town in California named "Got Milk?" But not
here. Not now.</LD>
<LD>   The residents of this small agricultural hamlet told the big
marketing machine that is the California Milk Processor Board last
week that they prefer the name the community claimed more than 100
years ago from a prominent wheat grower, Major Marion Biggs.</LD>
<LD>   Undeterred, the dairy marketing board said it would continue its
quest to convince one of more than 20 other California communities
that a name change might be good for business.</LD>
<TE>   Although most of the towns have so far turned a cold shoulder to
the idea, the head of the milk board has pitched the "Got Milk?" name
as a way for a small town to market itself, while simultaneously
promoting the product.</TE>
<TE>   The milk board's "Got Milk?" campaign will mark its 10-year
anniversary in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Biggs, a community of 1,734 people in the foothills north of
Sacramento, drew a brief but furious flurry of media attention in
recent weeks when it appeared to seriously entertain the idea of
changing its name.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Sharleta Calloway said that when she heard of the proposal
from Jeff Manning, executive director of the milk board, she thought
it must be a joke. When Manning told her it wasn't, she asked the
city attorney to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a ray of hope for us," Calloway said. But a lot of
residents, she added, "feel Jeff Manning used us for publicity."</TE>
<TE>   "He should focus on building something for the kids here," the
mayor added.</TE>
<TE>   Calloway insisted she never supported the name change, but many
locals believe she did. There was even talk that Calloway should be
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The only sign of economic activity in the town is the new rice
mill, built in 1999 after the town's last mill burned down. Along one
block of the main drag, eight shops have boarded their windows and
taken signs down.</TE>
<TE>   The closest dairies that remain open near Biggs resemble the
greener, more pastoral farms of yesteryear. The county's livestock
advisor predicts more dairies may be coming to Butte County and the
land around Biggs, as other counties increase environmental controls
on dairy farms.</TE>
<TE>   The milk board's Manning told city leaders that the "Got Milk?"
name could bring an increase in tourism and, in the short run, it
certainly got a number of news crews to swarm over the community.</TE>
<TE>   Manning also suggested a contribution from the milk board might
bring a new museum or school improvements to Biggs. But more
recently, Manning said neither he nor the California Milk Processor
Board would "cut a check" for the town.</TE>
<TE>   Some said they felt they were getting a runaround.</TE>
<TE>   "If he would've just laid out clearly from the beginning a
contract stating the terms," maybe there could have been a deal, said
one resident, Estella Bushyhead. "But the way it's been done ...
[everybody] feels like they're in a circus."</TE>
<TE>   Manning visited Biggs once, to appear on "Good Morning America"
during a promotion of the ad campaign. He said he knew it would be a
long shot to have the town change its name, but was "honored" that
the leaders of Biggs even considered it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great couple of weeks together," Manning said.</TE>

<HD>Chief Switches L.A.'s Crime Map System</HD>
<DH>Vowing to hold commanders accountable, Bratton discards
FASTRAC and adopts analysis program he used in New York.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein and Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton said the police
department's system for tracking crimes is so inadequate that he
decided to scrap it before instituting a model that was key to
reducing crime in New York City eight years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton said L.A.'s data analysis system, known by the acronym
FASTRAC, is a watered-down version of the original CompStat crime
mapping system he put in place as New York City's police commissioner
in the 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   In defending his decision, Bratton said the old system "takes up
an incredible amount of time and accomplishes nothing, the best I can
tell. So we are putting it on hold."</LD>
<TE>   Both systems use computer mapping to identify crime hot spots and
patterns. But in New York, crime data receive far more scrutiny and a
greater emphasis is placed on precinct commanders' figuring out
solutions and being held accountable, Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the decision to pull the plug was the first key
recommendation to come from his new command team, which includes Jim
McDonnell, George Gascon and Sharon Papa. McDonnell will officially
become Bratton's No. 2 and assistant chief Tuesday; Papa and Gascon
will be promoted to deputy chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   The FASTRAC program, which stands for Focus, Accountability,
Strategy, Teamwork, Response and Coordination, was put in place after
the 1999 Rampart scandal. But Bratton said it lacks accountability
for police managers and the precision needed to put department
resources where they are most needed. Because of those flaws, critics
say, it differed little from the pin maps used in the days of Chief
William H. Parker during the 1950s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said the new system will provide real-time information and
be a key part of his plans to put officers on the street.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials estimate it will take two months for their software
engineers to design the new system and get it running. Most, if not
all, the work is being done by software experts already working for
the department. Officials say that stopping FASTRAC will give those
experts more time to develop the CompStat system. Bratton said that,
once CompStat is running, he will oversee the meetings of division
captains, where data will be analyzed. In New York, Bratton used
these weekly meetings to pressure police managers to come up with
crime-fighting strategies. Many of those unable to react to Bratton's
system of accountability lost their commands. Bratton said he will
not tolerate commanders who are not aware of the criminal activity in
their patrol areas.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the system will face the added challenge of the
city's vast area.</TE>

<HD>In a State Sorely Needing Vision, Davis' Will Be Tested</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Fun's over. Beating up hapless Bill Simon Jr. and winning a second
term was great sport for Gov. Gray Davis. Now comes the difficult
drudgery: governing California.</LD>
<LD>   The warning of political sage Stu Spencer to then-Sen. Pete Wilson
still reverberates through the Capitol 13 years later: "California is
ungovernable." Wilson ignored his friend and ran for governor anyway.</LD>
<TE>   Spencer had in mind the state's wide diversity of viewpoints and
geography, scarce resources, perpetual population growth and lack of
political discipline. All this is particularly troublesome during bad
economic times like the present, when the state government faces its
second straight year of gargantuan budget deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the year-to-year challenges, no governor since Pat Brown
four decades ago has really planned for the next generation. We're
still drinking his water, driving his freeways, attending his
universities. And they're no longer enough to go around.</TE>
<TE>   Davis could shock us all and leave a shining legacy if he brought
together some of our great thinkers to plan for the time in only 25
years when there'll be 50 million people living in California. That
is, if he</TE>
<TE>   actually acquired a vision and exercised leadership to implement
it.</TE>
<TE>   Even more than Spencer's words, a caustic comment by Davis three
years ago still echoes through the Capitol, annoying legislators:
"Their job is to implement my vision."</TE>
<TE>   Says Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga: "If
he wants the Legislature to implement his vision, he needs to have
one."</TE>
<TE>   Sure, it's a partisan shot, but not one that Democrats don't also
frequently fire at the governor anonymously.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, Davis is as disliked in the Legislature as he is in
the electorate. (Next to Davis' narrow 5-point victory, the most
memorable number from California's election was the 60% who had an
unfavorable impression of the winner.)</TE>
<TE>   So Davis begins his second term a weakened governor. He has no
mandate from voters. Indeed, as of the latest count, 1.6 million
fewer people voted for Davis last Tuesday than when he won the office
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He faces a horrendous budget problem. There's a projected shortage
of at least $10 billion -- perhaps $20 billion -- for the next fiscal
year. That's what will be needed to balance the state's general fund,
now spending about $77 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Here's some perspective: If they fired every state civil servant,
that would save only $11 billion, according to nonpartisan
legislative analyst Elizabeth G. Hill. The fact is that 70% of the
general fund flows to schools and local government.</TE>
<TE>   California voters just added to the deficit by piling another
$18.6 billion onto the state's credit card for school, housing and
water projects. All good causes, of course, but that bond debt will
cost the general fund about $1.3 billion annually. Plus, add another
$550 million for Arnold Schwarzenegger's after-school program.</TE>
<TE>   Total yearly cost for all this newly mandated spending: $1.8
billion.</TE>
<TE>   It's an open question whether Davis is up to the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   His style is that of a risk-averse loner. Skittish and unsocial.</TE>
<TE>   Not only does Davis too often not delegate, he doesn't
micro-manage either, leading to drift and delay -- whether in filling
vacancies on regulatory boards or in confronting a looming energy
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   For a politician, he's not very political in dealing with the pols
he needs. He can charm, but more often grates. He doesn't enjoy
friendly banter. He's rude, keeping people waiting long past their
scheduled appointments.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' problem is this: His centrism doesn't excite Democrats, but
neither does he try to make up for it by developing relationships. By
bonding. Schmoozing.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not the kind of guy," an advisor says, "who tells his
secretary to call up recalcitrant committee chairs and 'see if they
have time to go to lunch with me today.' "</TE>
<TE>   But opportunity now has been handed Davis, as well as challenge.</TE>
<TE>   The budget crisis is his opening to demonstrate courage by boldly
proposing significant tax increases and deep spending cuts. Both
unpopular, but both inevitable. Davis can get credit for leading --
as Wilson once did.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, that's his job.</TE>
<TE>   Davis now is liberated from fund-raising because of term limits --
and because he can't run for the U.S. Senate, let alone president,
without first focusing for four years on being a productive governor.
Keeping out of the pockets of special interests could improve his
image.</TE>
<TE>   The governor should take the pledge to be more personable -- get
around the Capitol and the state, and not just for phony photo-ops.
Go talk to people.</TE>
<TE>   Have some fun. Take pols golfing -- without charging a
fund-raising fee. Maybe even look down the fairway to the next
generation.</TE>

<DH>Riverside National Cemetery averages four services an hour,
mostly for veterans of World War II. They're handled with military
precision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Anton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Out where the grass meets the dirt, where life meets death, work
begins early at the nation's busiest veterans cemetery.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after 8 a.m., a backhoe peels away a foot and a half of
hard clay to expose the day's crypts -- two rows of empty concrete
boxes lined up a quarter-inch apart. Workers help the driver remove
the 1,000-pound lids, then wait for the steady parade of hearses.</LD>
<LD>   "We used to have lulls, times when you didn't have much volume,"
said Ed Lamoreaux, who has been opening and closing graves at
Riverside National Cemetery for 15 years. "There are no lulls out
here anymore."</LD>
<TE>   Last year, there were 7,939 burials and inurnments at Riverside
National Cemetery, which serves an area stretching across Southern
California to Arizona and Nevada. On average, a memorial service is
held here every 15 minutes, five days a week. The crack of rifle fire
and the sound of taps drift on the air like background music
broadcast by the wind.</TE>
<TE>   As the World War II generation has aged, the pace at which
veterans are dying -- more than 1,700 each day -- has strained the
national cemetery system.</TE>
<TE>   Half the 120 cemeteries run by the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs are nearly out of burial space, and the wave of veteran
deaths isn't expected to peak until 2008, with a projected 658,000
deaths that year.</TE>
<TE>   Only about a third of Riverside National Cemetery's 920 acres --
an expanse equivalent to nearly 700 footballs fields -- near March
Air Reserve Base have been developed.</TE>
<TE>   When the cemetery reaches capacity sometime after 2030, Riverside
will contain more than 1 million burial sites, making it among the
largest cemeteries in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard with the volume we have not to appear like a production
line," said Richard Boyd, Riverside National Cemetery's assistant
director. "This is a very personal business, after all."</TE>
<TE>   Family members don't seem to mind the regimentation and close
quarters. The military in death is a lot like the military in life:
The cemetery is a study in efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   It was among the first national cemeteries to use flat grave
markers exclusively, in part because they are easier to maintain. As
a result, Riverside doesn't have the somber feel of, say, Arlington
National Cemetery, where row upon row of perfectly aligned tombstones
stand at attention.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside feels more like a vast, dimpled golf course quietly
awaiting its first tee time.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, it became the first national cemetery to employ what's
known in the burial business as presets. About 14,000 crypts are in
the ground ready to be opened -- a two-year supply -- and new ones
are being sunk all the time.</TE>
<TE>   Graveside services are discouraged. Instead, mourners in their
cars queue up at staging areas and are directed by a radio dispatcher
to one of seven "committal shelters," gazebos where services are
held.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, caskets are delivered to the area of gravesites
uncovered that morning and lowered into a numbered crypt. At day's
end, the backhoe covers them all with dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Within two months, granite markers are installed. Once a section
is full, fast-growing grass seed is blown across the area. The
sprinklers are connected and turned on.</TE>
<TE>   "Families don't go out there and watch how the burials take
place," said Jack Gerbl, a San Jacinto funeral director who often
arranges burials at the cemetery. "When you come back six months from
now, it will look all green and pretty."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Orderly Day</TE>
<TE>   By 10 a.m., the day is moving with military precision. Seven
funerals are scheduled in the next 61 minutes. Six are for World War
II vets.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Sandau, Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Torres, Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Ramirez, Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Sabo, Army.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Thompson, Army.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick Romero, Army.</TE>
<TE>   "My brother is buried here. My daughter's father is buried here.
And a cousin," said Barbara Romero, one of 18 family members
attending her father's funeral.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad wanted to be here too, because he thought it was so
beautiful and serene."</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in Los Angeles, Frederick Romero enlisted in the
Army in 1942. He worked in communications.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to be in combat, but never was. After the war, Romero
settled in La Habra and worked 38 years as a pattern maker for a
men's sportswear company. He had three children. He loved to dance.
He was 80 when he died.</TE>
<TE>   A gold box containing his ashes is placed on a table at Shelter G,
which overlooks a lake with a fountain in its center. A 14-man
military honor guard made up of retirees drives up in a white van and
takes up positions. Members of the unit range in age from 57 to 82,
work two days a month and are among the 500 volunteers who perform
services at the cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Romero's service is their 543rd in the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is 25,000 steps beyond a hobby," Jim L. Griffin, a member of
the unit, would say later. "It's an honor. It's a pleasure....
They're our brothers and sisters."</TE>
<TE>   Three riflemen fire off three rounds each. Taps is played. Barbara
Romero is handed a folded U.S. flag and thanked for her father's
service to his country. The honor guard piles back into the van and
drives off to the next appointment.</TE>
<TE>   "Fred would have loved that," said the Rev. Jim Dale, himself a
veteran who volunteers at the cemetery. "All that for him."</TE>
<TE>   Half an hour later, Shelter C. Twelve-year-old Nicholas Pinkus
plays taps. It was his grandfather's last request.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Ramirez of Mira Loma spent 1941 through 1945 in the Navy. A
boatswain's mate, he was a master seaman who ferried troops to shore
for battle. He transported MacArthur and Eisenhower too.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved being in the Navy," said his widow, Doris, 77. "Loved
being out on the ocean."</TE>
<TE>   Back home, he became an upholsterer and, later, superintendent of
a furniture factory. He reluctantly retired two years ago at 79
because he wasn't feeling well.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of months later, he was diagnosed with cancer. He always
thought he would beat it.</TE>
<TE>   Until the end, he was repairing and making furniture for friends
and family. Many of the three dozen people at his service owned a
piece made by Ramirez.</TE>
<TE>   As they head back to their cars, a bagpipe squeals over at Shelter
F.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Thompson of Santa Ana died at age 78, half a century after
combat in the Philippines as an Army private.</TE>
<TE>   "He really didn't talk about it," Kathleen Thompson said of her
husband. "I don't know why. It was part of his life, but it was in
his past. He put it aside so he could go forward."</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Thompson went to junior college and worked 35 years
for Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. He started as a cable splicer,
moved up to home installations and was promoted to installing
telephone systems in businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "He enjoyed his life," his widow said. "He loved fishing. When he
retired, we'd go down to Balboa and sit down with a cup of coffee and
fish. Didn't matter if he caught anything."</TE>
<TE>   In April, Thompson had a stroke. Suddenly, inexplicably, he began
talking about the war.</TE>
<TE>   "All he would talk about was his brother," Kathleen Thompson said.
"He had been a pilot and was killed over France. I never heard him
talk about his brother before. It bothered me.... You hear about
people talking to loved ones on the other side. I don't know how else
to explain it."</TE>
<TE>   Less than a hour later, Thompson is lowered into Section 57A, No.
218. Angel Ramirez is a quarter-inch away, in No. 217.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are spray-painted in red inside each crypt, and when a
casket arrives its work order is checked and double-checked to make
sure the numbers match.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Emotionless Job</TE>
<TE>   All that Steven Ferrell knows about the people he buries five days
a week is their numbers.</TE>
<TE>   It is all he needs to know. "I try to know as little as possible,"
Ferrell said. "With 8,000 every year, I'd go insane if I had any
personal involvement."</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell, 47, is typical of the men who tend to Riverside's dead.
He's a longtime employee; after eight years, he earns $14 an hour.
He's older; the average age of Riverside's staff is 56. And he's a
veteran: Army, 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   There is a routine to the job that renders it emotionless. Ferrell
and his crew of grave-diggers speak of 5-footers and 7-footers -- the
shallower crypt is for single caskets, the deeper one roomy enough
for a spouse to be laid on top later.</TE>
<TE>   They know that Mondays and Fridays are the busiest days.</TE>
<TE>   "Each day is the same," Ferrell said. "The only thing that changes
are the numbers."</TE>
<TE>   As the afternoon light fades, the backhoe moves in and covers the
now-occupied crypts. The men know to stand upwind.</TE>
<TE>   When the brown cloud clears, a steamroller flattens the row. Then
it's raked out, and temporary plastic markers are staked at each
spot.</TE>
<TE>   "I have 12 friends of mine out there.... There's Terry, John,
Jesse, Willie," Ferrell said, picking up bouquets of flowers from a
pile, checking their numbers and placing them on the corresponding
graves. "They're our own, coming home to us. Someday, this will be
our place too."</TE>

<HD>Biologists Hatch New Plan for Condors</HD>
<DH>Chicks will be helped at first sign of distress. Critics
say human contact is the problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent deaths of three California condor chicks born in the wild
is bringing a new, more hands-on management style to a program to
save the rare birds. But critics say the changes do nothing to remedy
fundamental flaws in the $35-million project.</LD>
<LD>   Although condors have been coddled in captivity and closely
monitored in the wild for two decades, the three turkey-sized chicks
died last month. One had eaten everything from bottle caps to metal
screws.</LD>
<LD>   So now video cameras running 24 hours a day may be trained on nest
sites. Food will be placed near caves to keep parents from foraging,
and nests with eggs will be inspected for items that could kill young
birds. And if biologists sense a problem, they will quickly intervene
-- a major shift from a policy of steering clear of the chicks.</LD>
<TE>   "Threats can be eliminated by intensive management," said Bruce
Palmer, who coordinates the condor recovery effort for the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service. "How far we go can be debated, but we will do
everything that is practical."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the real problem is an emphasis on quantity over
quality. They believe condors are released into the wild simply to
boost numbers. And despite some recent successes, they say, the birds
often cannot survive on their own, making the goal of an independent,
wild population as far off as ever.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have a self-sustaining population of condors out there
and, unless they change their methodology, you won't get one," said
David Clendenen, who spent 15 years as a top biologist with the
program before resigning in frustration over its direction.</TE>
<TE>   "How long do you keep pouring millions of dollars into something
that is not sustainable?" he said. "I hate to say the birds are
doomed; I love the condor. But I don't see this trend turning around
until something changes."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, just before their first flights, the first three
condor chicks born in the wild since 1984 died in the Los Padres
National Forest, dashing hopes for a new generation of wild condors.</TE>
<TE>   One chick had swallowed a virtual junkyard. Pathologists found 12
bottle caps, electrical wiring, screws, washers, glass and plastic in
its gizzard and stomach. Biologists are not sure whether the bird was
born in a former raven's nest, full of objects collected by the
curious birds, or if the condor parents brought the items to the nest
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of death of the other two chicks remains under
investigation, though both had foreign objects inside them. The
father of one of the young birds is missing and presumed dead.</TE>
<TE>   Disappointment also struck at the Grand Canyon earlier this year,
when one condor egg failed to hatch and another was shattered, with
the chick missing. A third egg was intentionally destroyed by an
adult condor last year.</TE>
<TE>   Those who raise and release condors say these are minor setbacks
on the road to restoring the majestic, red-eyed vultures to their
ancestral habitats. Their goal is two condor populations of 150 each
in Arizona and California. There are now 74 condors in the wild and
126 in captivity.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of these are surprising or discouraging,
especially with captive birds," said Bill Heinrich, species
restoration manager for the Peregrine Fund in Boise, Idaho, which
reintroduced condors to the Grand Canyon. "Sometimes it takes three
nesting attempts to get it right. I think it's lack of experience."</TE>
<TE>   But Noel Snyder, one of the pioneers of the condor program, thinks
it's more than that.</TE>
<TE>   "The kinds of solutions they are proposing strike me as basically
Scotch tape on a much more fundamental problem," said Snyder, who
headed condor restoration efforts for the Fish and Wildlife Service
in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   He said condors have been tainted by their proximity to people.
Rather than avoiding people, as their wild ancestors did, these birds
often hang out near sites of human activity. As a result, condors
have dunked themselves in oil, drunk antifreeze, landed in
schoolyards, vandalized property and eaten lead bullets. In other
cases, they have intentionally killed their chicks and formed bizarre
love triangles.</TE>
<TE>   Few of these activities were seen in the historic populations,
Snyder said. His solution is drastic.</TE>
<TE>   "The quantity-versus-quality argument hasn't worked. The
fundamental solution is to start over again with birds that have not
had such a compromised early development in a zoo environment,"
Snyder said. "You must limit releases to parent-reared birds that
have never seen humans. They must be raised, not in zoos, but in
field enclosures with no contact with people."</TE>
<TE>   Condors in the wild would be trapped and returned to captivity so
as not to contaminate the others with their behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this is admitting defeat," Snyder said. "This is an
expensive program, and the problems we see are continuous. I am
optimistic about the program, and I would hate to give up before
trying our best shot."</TE>
<TE>   Vicky Meretsky, assistant professor of conservation biology at
Indiana University, said condors readily reproduce in captivity, but
she worries that the current program has become a stocking operation.
"I'd rather have a self-sustaining wild population," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy over how best to manage North America's largest bird
has dogged the program from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Some believed condors should be left alone, with biologists
intervening only in emergencies. Others said that with so few condors
left, it was vital to give them every advantage until they could
build a sustainable population.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the highly managed philosophy won out.</TE>
<TE>   Condor eggs and chicks are monitored around the clock at the Los
Angeles and San Diego zoos and the Peregrine Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Birds undergo behavioral training in captivity to avoid power
poles.</TE>
<TE>   Before release they are fitted with transmitters. Frozen calf
carcasses are provided as food in the wild. The birds are tracked
every day.</TE>
<TE>   But as the recent deaths show, none of this ensures success.</TE>
<TE>   "Murphy's Law works overtime on this project," said Mike Wallace,
condor recovery team leader. "You have to adjust and create more
remedies. You can only imagine how to bring back a species, until you
try to do it. Quality versus quantity is such a trite way of painting
what we are doing."</TE>
<TE>   He said numbers are critical to the long-term success of the
birds. The more birds released, he said, the better the odds the
species will survive.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, who helped reestablish Andean condors in South America,
said biologists already recapture birds that get too close to humans
or exhibit erratic behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, he plans to begin the type of experiment Snyder is
calling for. Wallace hopes to put four pairs of condors in a remote
pen on Ted Turner's Ladder Ranch in southwestern New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "We want parents to raise the chicks in isolation and have the
chicks fledge into the wild," he said. "This isn't a new idea. We
just didn't have the money or expertise to do it before. I want to do
this experiment and put this issue to rest."</TE>
<TE>   And like it or not, Wallace said, intensive management will
continue for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "How much do we manage? When can we back off? When can we stop
being mothers out there?" he asked. "My answer is, 'When we are
done.' And we are not done until we have a species out there living
on its own."</TE>

<HD>Environmental Group No Longer a Natural</HD>
<DH>Citizens to Preserve the Ojai's loss of a ballot measure
last week may reflect a dislike of its evolving tactics, including
litigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gail Davis</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pioneering Ojai Valley environmental group, widely respected as a
protector of all things naturally Ojai, has alienated many residents
with positions even some longtime supporters say are extreme.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Ojai voters defeated by nearly 2 to 1 a ballot measure
sponsored by the group -- Citizens to Preserve the Ojai -- that city
leaders said would have brought growth to a virtual halt.</LD>
<LD>   Ojai, a city of 7,800 residents, is already the slowest-growing
city in growth-conscious Ventura County, increasing its population
just 0.3% a year in the 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   The citizens group has also incurred the wrath of the City Council
by filing lawsuits that have cost taxpayers more than $150,000 to
defend in the last two years, according to City Manager Dan Singer.</TE>
<TE>   One suit recently blocked construction of a 26-unit upscale
condominium project intended to replace 33 dilapidated houses that
made up the city's only slum.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Steve Olsen said Citizens to Preserve the Ojai has not
accurately taken the community's pulse in four or five years.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone will agree that the CPO is a necessary organization,"
Olsen said. "But they've chosen to make personal attacks and alienate
themselves from the process. That needs to change."</TE>
<TE>   But Ivor Benci-Woodward, president of the citizens group, said it
is as vital and necessary today as ever, especially since the current
crop of city officials seem more accommodating to developers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think to the man and woman on the street that what the
CPO is doing is [extreme]," he said. "I think it is beyond what the
City Council and the Chamber of Commerce and the power structures
want."</TE>
<TE>   Even the 35% approval of the group's ballot Measure C on Tuesday
can be seen as proof that residents value the organization's role, he
said. The measure would have forbidden city approval of new projects
if they added significantly more traffic on surroundings streets.</TE>
<TE>   "We won anyway," Benci-Woodward said, "because traffic really was
the No. 1 issue of the campaign for all the candidates."</TE>
<TE>   Results of the City Council race, however, may indicate a gulf
between the citizens group and voters.</TE>
<TE>   Voters overwhelmingly rejected Measure C, which was opposed by the
council. And they reelected Councilmen David Bury and Joe DeVito.</TE>
<TE>   A third council seat now held by Olsen, who is retiring, remains
undecided. Bruce Roland, who opposed Measure C, is trailing Carol B.
Smith, who supported it, by only 10 votes.</TE>
<TE>   Benci-Woodward said that despite the election results, his group
is determined to challenge the city's decisions in court when it does
not follow its own legally binding growth plans.</TE>
<TE>   And he said he is optimistic that a public forum Thursday on
traffic problems will start to solve issues raised by Measure C.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the group, which in the '70s and '80s brought together
environmentally conscious residents, may have pushed too far this
time, some say.</TE>
<TE>   Former mayor Nina Shelley, who led opponents of the Weldon Canyon
garbage dump site in the 1990s, said the organization should end its
adversarial tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any bitterness toward special interest groups or the
CPO; I respect them," Shelley said. "But to always be challenging as
if they have the same power as the City Council is a gross
miscalculation."</TE>
<TE>   Membership rolls for Ojai's environmental groups could also
indicate disapproval of the group. In its heyday, membership swelled
to more than 900, said Patricia Weinberger, who founded it about 30
years ago. She has not been a member since the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Benci-Woodward said today the group has about 350 members and the
recent campaign drew 10 to 15 new ones.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Ojai Valley Land Conservancy, founded 15 years ago,
has grown from 350 members to about 1,100 in the last five years,
said Executive Director Jim Engel.</TE>
<TE>   "The land conservancy is the only viable environmental
organization where people can focus their concerns," said Weinberger,
a conservancy member.</TE>
<TE>   The two groups have different goals. The citizens group focuses on
political activism, and the conservancy deals exclusively with land
stewardship.</TE>
<TE>   Weinberger said the conservancy satisfies a need once fulfilled by
Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, offering educational programs and
nature walks to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Baggerly, a longtime member of the citizens group and
president of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County, said the
former still serves an important watchdog role.</TE>
<TE>   Baggerly said the Ojai City Council sometimes breaks state
environmental law and its own rules when considering new development
proposals. So it has to be forced to follow the law, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they don't do it," he said, "you try to do it yourself."</TE>
<TE>   A good example of how the city now favors builders, he said, is
the 26-unit Los Arboles condo project next to Libbey Park.</TE>
<TE>   A Superior Court judge recently struck down city approval because
officials had allowed the new condos to be built too close together.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to approve that [project] so badly, they're willing to
change the intent of many years of planning," Baggerly said. "Their
arrogance seems to have no limits."</TE>
<TE>   Even critics don't want Citizens to Preserve the Ojai to roll over
and go away.</TE>
<TE>   The group could once again mobilize public opinion, Weinberger
said, if it adopts a gentler approach.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where salesmanship and instruction come in," she said.
"All these people seem to know is how to litigate."</TE>

<HD>Ventura County Bills Slain Man's Parents for Lawsuit Costs</HD>
<DH>After unsuccessfully suing sheriff's deputies over their
son's death, the couple learn a $16,000 lien has been placed on their
home.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though a federal jury disagreed, Jim and Ann Dowey still think
Ventura County sheriff's deputies battered their son, Nick.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Doweys feel Ventura County is beating up on them.</LD>
<LD>   The county has put a $16,000 lien on the couple's Ventura house to
recoup a portion of its costs in fighting their lawsuit against five
sheriff's deputies. In trying to subdue the 21-year-old student after
someone crushed his skull with a bat outside a party in 1997, the
deputies contributed to his death, the parents say.</LD>
<TE>   The Doweys lost their case in 1999 and, on appeal, in 2001. Their
case alleged that the deputies used excessive force on their mortally
wounded son. They say the county now is being vindictive.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually you have the politicians on your side when your child has
been murdered. It's never been like that with us," Jim Dowey said.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, more than a dozen witnesses from the rowdy party in the
Ojai Valley community of Meiners Oaks testified they saw deputies put
Nick Dowey -- bleeding and disoriented -- in a choke hold, douse him
with pepper spray and strike him with the spray can or a flashlight.
The jury sided with the county, which maintained that only one deputy
hit Dowey -- with the small canister -- because the young man was
combative and had to be restrained until medical aid arrived.</TE>
<TE>   The county rightfully and routinely seeks to recoup its costs when
it is successful at trial, County Counsel Frank Sieh said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the taxpayers' money," he said. "It's an entitlement that
the county has."</TE>
<TE>   The bill to the Doweys -- for just under $16,000 -- was approved
by a judge and the Board of Supervisors. It covers costs of filing
fees and depositions and is just a fraction of the $412,000 the
county spent on its defense, Sieh said.</TE>
<TE>   "The family elected to go to trial in the face of a substantial
settlement offer from the county," and having to pay the victors'
costs is a risk that litigants take, Sieh said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County offered to settle the Doweys' lawsuit for as much
as $250,000, its attorneys said, though the parents' lawyer said
$50,000 was the best offer. The Doweys said they took the case to
trial to answer questions about how their son died.</TE>
<TE>   "This was never about money; it was about justice," Ann Dowey
said. "We knew that the Sheriff's Department was not going to put
their deputies on trial, so we knew we had to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Dowey said the trial gave his family no comfort, but in
refusing to settle, "one thing we didn't do is sell our son out."</TE>
<TE>   The Doweys did settle a lawsuit against the hosts of the party
where Nick was attacked. They used the $250,000 to pay their lawyer
and pursue their lawsuit against the deputies, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Five years since Nick's death, the case remains unsolved. There
have been no arrests and witnesses aren't talking, said Ventura
County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Dante Honorico, who supervises
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them are reluctant; some of them are outright hostile to
us," Honorico said. "That's one of the things that we are fighting on
this case."</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department fired Deputy Donald Rodarte, who was sued
by the Doweys, after an internal investigation found that he had lied
about striking Nick. In 2000, the county Civil Service Commission
disagreed and ordered that Rodarte be rehired.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Wisotsky, the lawyer who defended Ventura County against the
Doweys, said the couple are making an issue of the court costs and
portraying the county as cold-hearted because their son's case is
still open.</TE>
<TE>   If there was "a suspect in custody or someone convicted, they
might feel differently," Wisotsky said. "I think they're just looking
for somebody to place the blame on."</TE>
<TE>   The county filed to collect its costs three years ago. The Doweys
said they did not receive notice of the lien until Wisotsky wrote to
them in August.</TE>

Meanwhile, the Doweys have hired a civil lawyer to negotiate the
costs.</TE>
<TE>   The Doweys argue they saved Ventura County money by paying their
adult son's $30,000 public hospital bill. Because Nick was of age,
they could have left the county on the hook. The family also donated
Nick's organs and say his heart, liver and kidneys were transplanted
into four people.</TE>

<HD>Legal Fees Draw Fire</HD>
<DH>Critics question the millions of dollars spent to defend
South Gate and Cudahy officials under investigation for political
corruption.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of the region's poorest cities have spent millions of dollars in
public funds to defend officials under investigation for political
corruption, and are resisting public scrutiny of the bills.</LD>
<LD>   In South Gate, legal fees in criminal cases now approach $1.5
million, 10% of the annual budget. In Cudahy, the county's
second-poorest city, attorney fees have cost nearly $800,000, about
half of the city's emergency reserves.</LD>
<LD>   As costs mount, so do questions from critics about the legality
and size of the bills.</LD>
<TE>   Politicians in both cities insist that publicly financed defenses
are necessary to protect themselves and their colleagues from
overzealous prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   But a judge in one South Gate case has ordered the city to halt
payments to one law firm after he was persuaded by residents'
arguments in a lawsuit claiming that the defense payments amounted to
a gift of public funds.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, the same law firm, Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp;
Hampton, billed the city $613,000 for representing Treasurer Albert
Robles in a grand jury investigation in which he appeared only
briefly and did not testify.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney at the center of the controversy, Thomas M. Brown,
refused to answer questions about his firm's fees. Brown's firm has
charged as much as $425 an hour for his services.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy comes two years after Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley
launched investigations countywide into allegations of municipal
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   The legal dream teams hired in South Gate and Cudahy include
former federal prosecutors and a former state Supreme Court justice
from some of Los Angeles' most prestigious and expensive law firms.
One member of the Cudahy defense team is former Dist. Atty. Robert
Philibosian. A key campaign supporter of Cooley, he is a partner of
Brown's at Sheppard Mullin.</TE>
<TE>   City officials in South Gate refused requests from The Times for
access to the billing statements, citing attorney-client privilege.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these city councils are authorizing these outrageous,
obscene amounts of money for these defense attorneys ... without any
basis," Cooley said. "It's just another example of their corruption."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys blame Cooley. They accuse his prosecutors in the
public integrity unit of badgering and humiliating witnesses, and of
pursuing politically motivated cases.</TE>
<TE>   "The public integrity unit has no integrity," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   His co-counsel, George B. Newhouse Jr., one of eight defense
lawyers in the South Gate investigations, called the prosecution "an
assault on democracy in South Gate. The city will not countenance
having its elected officials ousted by any means other than the
ballot box."</TE>
<TE>   It is common for municipalities to pay for the defense of public
officials when their actions could subject city taxpayers to civil
lawsuits and liability, such as in police misconduct or sexual
harassment cases.</TE>
<TE>   In public corruption cases, councils often follow different legal
strategies, based on whether they believe that the public interest is
at stake. Councils in Bell Gardens and Huntington Park have decided
to let alleged wrongdoers in their cities defend themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has said that he plans to report Cooley to the State Bar of
California for allegedly contacting some of his clients improperly.
Cooley's prosecutors no longer speak with Brown without a court
reporter present.</TE>
<TE>   In South Gate, a working-class city of 96,000, almost every
elected official has been under investigation within the last year.
Brown represents Robles, the city's perceived political boss, in two
cases. In one, Robles was subpoenaed as part of a grand jury
investigation last year that ended with two allies pleading no
contest to electoral fraud charges.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing before the grand jury in December, Robles invoked his
5th Amendment right against self-incrimination and did not testify.
He made one other brief court appearance, and he was never charged
with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's firm billed South Gate for $78,000 during the month of
Robles' grand jury appearance, and the fees escalated dramatically in
the ensuing months. A review of one heavily edited billing statement
obtained by The Times shows that Brown and his associates -- billing
from $225 to $405 per hour -- worked 175 hours in March.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said that was after the grand jury proceedings had
ended and Robles was not a suspect. The fees eventually topped more
than $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's bills continued to mount after Robles was charged in April
with threatening to kill two state lawmakers. Robles' critics thought
that the city should refuse to pay for his defense.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, a public entity is not required to provide for
the defense of an employee who is charged with a crime unless the
illegal act is committed within the scope of the worker's official
duties.</TE>
<TE>   Newhouse, Brown's co-counsel, argued that the alleged death
threats, even if true, were a form of protected political speech and
that Robles was acting within his duties as city treasurer when he
uttered them.</TE>
<TE>   Using that argument, Robles' City Council allies passed a
resolution authorizing his defense, in a vote that infuriated
residents. Two businessmen, with many residents' support, then went
to court and argued that the payment of Robles' legal fees was
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   In August, a judge ordered payments stopped, saying that he was
troubled by the city's argument.</TE>
<TE>   The day before, the city had sent another check, this one for
$146,000, to Brown's law firm.</TE>
<TE>   The threats case, which is still in its early stages, has so far
cost taxpayers at least $333,000</TE>
<TE>   Brown's billing for $425 an hour compares with a fee of $80 an
hour allotted to attorneys working for the alternate public
defender's office of Los Angeles County. By comparison, death penalty
defenses -- the most complicated and costly of criminal cases --
rarely top $250,000, said Michael F. Yamamoto, former president of
California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, an organization of
criminal defense lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's outrageous.... It is way out of line," said Yamamoto,
referring to the fees charged by Brown's firm. "The highest-paid
lawyers in criminal law, they don't charge that. You can ask any
lawyer in the business."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, when asked about the fees, refused to comment. "I don't
feel like talking about this," he said in a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   "These lawyers should have known that this was an impermissible
use of public funds," said Glenn Rothner, the attorney who won the
court order halting payments, and is now seeking the return of the
money to the city. "The taxpayers of South Gate need every penny of
these vast resources back in the city treasury."</TE>
<TE>   In Cudahy, the City Council, meeting in nearly empty chambers, has
authorized publicly financed defenses without generating controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are investigating whether former Councilman George
Perez pressured other members to appoint him city manager. The
investigation began in April 2001, when investigators seized
thousands of documents and later subpoenaed more than a dozen
witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The city has paid $786,000 so far to six law firms. The biggest
chunk, $438,000, has gone to Brown's firm. The city provided heavily
edited billing statements to The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of money, a lot of money for any city, but we didn't
bring this upon us," said Perez, adding that he was satisfied with
the attorneys' performance. "They're doing their job. They keep us
informed of what's going on, and they have reacted favorably to our
request to keep a lid on fees."</TE>
<TE>   The legal disputes have centered on prosecutorial access to a
number of documents that were seized, and on the tactics of
prosecutors during grand jury proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Brown accused prosecutors of misconduct for allegedly threatening
to jail witnesses who invoked their 5th Amendment rights.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Terry Bork, the lead prosecutor in the Cudahy
case, said he could not comment on the accusations because they
involve confidential grand jury proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Bork said Brown's tactics are part of a larger pattern designed to
frustrate and slow the probe, in which no charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bork: "It doesn't take $800,000 to cooperate with an
investigation."</TE>

<HD>Like It or Not, Fluoridation Is State Law</HD>
<DH>Voters' wishes aside, the addition of fluoride is required
for all water systems with 10,000 hookups, though no taxes can be
used for it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Gurnon</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though voters in Redding last week tried to block city attempts to
provide fluoridated water, state health officials said residents will
soon have no choice in the matter.</LD>
<LD>   State law requires that communities with at least 10,000 water
hookups add fluoride to their water systems, as long as start-up
money is available from a source other than taxes.</LD>
<LD>   California has not yet forced any city to fluoridate, but that day
may have arrived.</LD>
<TE>   "The state will ultimately enforce the law," said Dr. David F.
Nelson, a fluoridation consultant with the state Department of Health
Services. "It will have to. It has no choice."</TE>
<TE>   As long as money to buy and install fluoridation equipment is
offered to Redding, the city must add fluoride, Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Redding was offered $1.6 million for the project,
said Jon Roth, executive director of the California Dental Assn.
Foundation. Roth's group is responsible for funneling portions of a
$15-million grant from a private foundation, the California
Endowment, to various communities for their fluoridation efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Redding's Measure A prohibited the city from adding to its water
any chemical not "approved" by the Food and Drug Administration --
even though the federal agency has no jurisdiction over water issues.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that 56% of Redding voters approved Measure A is moot,
Nelson said, adding that "state law trumps local initiative."</TE>
<TE>   Money for fluoridation has also been offered and accepted by the
city of Watsonville, which had a measure on Tuesday's ballot nearly
identical to Redding's. The result of that election was still too
close to call Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Watsonville will also be forced to fluoridate,
Nelson said. Exemption from the law has already been retracted. "It's
a fait accompli in that community," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Once a city is notified that it is no longer exempt from the law,
it has two years to begin fluoridation.</TE>
<TE>   Michel Czehatowski, a Redding acupuncturist and leader of the
anti-fluoride group there, said he believes it would be illegal for
state officials to offer money to fluoridate Redding. "What that is
called is a bribe. They're asking them to take money to circumvent
the law."</TE>
<TE>   Czehatowski's group, Redding Citizens for Safe Drinking Water,
raised questions during the campaign about the safety of fluoride and
the compound commonly used to fluoridate water, fluorosilicic acid.
It called fluoridation "mass medication."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the measure -- including the local hospitals, the
Redding school district, the chamber of commerce, the child-care
planning council and most local doctors and dentists -- dismissed the
anti-fluoride group as "fear mongers" who set out to confuse the
public.</TE>
<TE>   Fluoride has been used in water systems since 1945 to help prevent
dental decay. However, only about one-third of Californians have
access to fluoridated water, compared with nearly two-thirds of all
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, tooth decay is the single most common chronic
childhood disease, according to the U.S. surgeon general. Children in
California have twice as much dental disease as children in other
states, Nelson said. It was concern about dental disease that led the
Legislature to pass AB 933, the fluoridation law, in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Other cities that have decided against fluoridation will not be
penalized, Nelson said. Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz voted it down,
but were not offered any grant money for fluoridation. Modesto voted
against fluoridated water last year, but grant money it had been
offered was diverted to other cities.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles, Sacramento, Escondido and Santa Maria, among other
cities, have accepted grant money and are in the process of
fluoridating, Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   The city of San Diego has a law dating from the 1950s that
specifically prohibits the addition of fluoride to the water. The
state could force the issue there, Nelson said, but "we are
negotiating with San Diego."</TE>

<DH>Children from foster homes and shelters have a day of fun
with volunteers, some of whom agree to give more time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lee Romney</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They ate cotton candy and squealed in terror on the Sea Dragon and
the West Coaster. They had their faces painted with dolphins and
angels. And they gamely begged autographs from the Backstreet Boys
and other heart-throb celebrities.</LD>
<LD>   For the more than 1,300 children who ran themselves ragged Sunday
at the Santa Monica Pier, the day of pampering orchestrated by a
Sherman Oaks-based nonprofit organization offered a chance at
something simple: just to be a kid.</LD>
<LD>   All came from foster homes or shelters for the homeless. Behind
each grinning face were stories of broken homes and abuses that no
child should suffer. But on Sunday, what mattered most were concerns
like 12-year-old Raylene's: "Should I try to win the Scooby-Doo or
the giant dragon?" Raylene was enjoying the day with a friend from
her La Puente group home -- 12-year-old Nadila. (The girls' last
names are not being used to protect their identities.)</LD>
<TE>   The event, which closed the pier's rides and restaurants to the
general public for much of the day, paired children ages 6 to 14 with
adult mentors.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, this year's fourth annual "Day of the Child,"
organized by Children Uniting Nations, also secured longer-term
commitments from volunteers willing to remain a presence in the lives
of their charges or to help other foster children. The possibilities
range from monthly visits and academic tutoring to adoption.</TE>
<TE>   "It opens the public up to the fact that these kids need other
people in their lives," said Valerie Fitzgerald, 48, a Brentwood real
estate broker who sits on the organization's board of directors and
served as mentor to Raylene and Nadila.</TE>
<TE>   Working with more than a thousand children entrenched in the
county bureaucracy is not easy.</TE>
<TE>   Legal logistics were among the challenges. To allow media to
photograph Sunday's events, the group had to obtain a court order.
Some kids sported coding on their name badges, indicating that they
were on medication or could not be photographed at all because they
live in hiding from an abusive parent, said board member Lola Levoy.</TE>
<TE>   Levoy, owner of Beverly Hills Escrow, said that many of the
children are forced out of the system when they are 18 without the
skills to get along on their own and that as many as three-fourths of
prison inmates nationwide were once in foster care. Among the young
girls whom Levoy has assisted was one who was sold for sex from the
age of 2 by a series of uncles in exchange for drug money.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the horror, however, are children just like all others.
Raylene plays the bass clarinet in her sixth grade school band and
prefers strawberry ice cream to chocolate. Nadila loves baseball and
kept her eyes peeled Sunday for her favorite celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   Both girls grinned wide-eyed as rapper and actor Coolio signed the
backs of their T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   They posed for pictures with JC of 'N Sync, also a product of the
foster system, and ogled the Backstreet Boys' AJ.</TE>
<TE>   They held hands and rode the roller coaster, stumbling off a
little green but full of smiles.</TE>
<TE>   "My tummy feels funny," Raylene said, "in a good way."</TE>

<HD>Relic of a Lost Era, Gold Mine Strikes Only Trouble Now</HD>
<DH>Owner, charged in a fatal accident, says the Old West is
being killed off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lee Romney</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ALLEGHANY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>To hear some tell it, Michael Meister Miller's fight is the Mother
Lode's last stand.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1896, his mine, the Sixteen to One, has yielded some of the
state's densest gold concentrations. Mined today much as it was a
century ago by mud-caked men with picks, drills and dynamite, it is a
living link to California's Gold Rush era.</LD>
<LD>   For some, the Sixteen to One evokes the gritty pageantry of the
'49ers. To others, it is a throwback to a reckless time of needless
injuries to people and the environment.</LD>
<TE>   Today, after the death of a miner, that way of life is on trial --
not just in the court of public opinion, but in the Sierra County
Courthouse where Miller and his mine manager face manslaughter and
other felony charges.</TE>
<TE>   The indictments of Miller, 60, and 32-year-old Jonathan Farrell
mark only the third time that felony charges have been brought
against individuals under a 2-year-old labor law for "willful
violation of a safety standard" that results in death.</TE>
<TE>   The case has divided a county that still clings to its mining
roots despite the industry's decline and a steady trickle of
newcomers who don't rely on the region's traditional sources of
income -- logging and mining -- or profess much nostalgia for its
fading way of life.</TE>
<TE>   These days, local businesses in the county seat of Downieville,
about an hour and a half northeast of Nevada City, are more dependent
on mountain bikers and other recreational tourists. Expatriates from
Truckee, Tahoe and Reno drive up property values. The shift is
aligning the county more closely with a modern California -- one
defined by tough environmental and workplace protections.</TE>
<TE>   "Miller was born 70 years too late," said Brian Van Camp, a
Sacramento County Superior Court judge and former Sixteen to One
board member. "If you're going to extract minerals in the regulated
civilized community, you're going to have to abide by a whole lot of
rules. Yes, they didn't have them back then and it was easier, but
things have changed."</TE>
<TE>   The Sixteen to One is among about a half-dozen underground
hard-rock mines still operating in California, and the only
commercial gold mine left in a county that owes its origins to
mining.</TE>
<TE>   While low gold prices, industry consolidation and cumbersome
regulations have driven off most small subsurface operators, Miller
thumbs his nose at the odds and the regulators. He and his men dig
for gold the old-fashioned way -- in 27 miles of dank tunnels braced
by wooden beams erected nearly 100 years ago. These days, profits are
so meager that neither Miller nor his skeleton crew are drawing
salaries.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal regulators have cited the mine more than 180
times over the last decade for faulty escape routes, broken ladders,
improper storage of explosives. State water quality officials have
fined the company for allowing arsenic-laden water to flow into
nearby Kanaka Creek, polluting the downstream drinking supply.</TE>
<TE>   The manslaughter charges stem from the death two years ago of
miner Mark Fussell, 36.</TE>
<TE>   Fussell was operating a locomotive deep in the mine and had put it
in reverse to retrieve some lumber. His head was crushed between the
locomotive's battery and an ore chute that investigators say
protruded lower than others in the mine and was unmarked. They also
allege that the gears malfunctioned and that the locomotive had been
placed on the track backward.</TE>
<TE>   The mine had been cited previously for not marking a similar ore
chute on a different level of the mine. That opened the door for
prosecutors to file felony charges against Miller and Farrell.</TE>
<TE>   An arraignment is scheduled for Nov. 20.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor, Gale Filter, explained the decision to charge
Miller and Farrell and not just the company that controls the mine.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is corporations don't make decisions, individuals
do," said Filter, who heads the California District Attorneys Assn.'s
worker safety project. "We prosecute only the most egregious type of
conduct," Filter added.</TE>
<TE>   Miller called the case "meritless," saying it was Fussell's job to
mark hazards, like the one that killed him, and blamed the miner's
death on his own negligence.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark had a lapse of what I call the fool killer," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Miller nor Farrell was present during the incident.
Moreover, a state inspector had stood beneath the same chute a week
earlier and failed to notice a hazard, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   If he can be charged with killing his worker under those
circumstances, said Miller, the industry is headed for trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who feel that California will be a better place
without the ability to produce gold, and they'll use any means to try
to accomplish that," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Sierra County, part-time prospectors still dredge the
rivers for gold and work small, private claims. A sign in the office
of the county's weekly newspaper declares: "We Support the Mother
Lode Miners and the American Mining Industry and They Support Us."</TE>
<TE>   Many remain convinced that a spike in gold prices is all that's
needed to revive the Mother Lode.</TE>
<TE>   "All you need is one more 9/11 scare to send gold sky high," said
David O'Donnell, a third-generation miner who works an underground
claim on evenings and weekends and heads the nearly defunct Northern
Mining Council.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad used to tell me, 'You've got to be honest, you've got to
have money and you've got to have patience.' You put those
ingredients together and we'll have gold mining in this area again."</TE>
<TE>   Miller's supporters point out that Fussell's death was the mine's
first fatality in more than 50 years. This year alone, 56 people have
died in mines around the country.</TE>
<TE>   "No one believed that anything but an accident had happened," said
Bill Copren, the county assessor. "As tragic as it might be, it's the
nature of the business. You can be a computer assistant manager if
you don't want your job to kill you."</TE>
<TE>   "Mike is a lot of things. Willfully negligent is not one of them,"
said Don Russell, the bearded, barrel-bellied owner of the weekly
Mountain Messenger in Downieville.</TE>
<TE>   The Sixteen to One was carved out of the granite bedrock of the
central Sierra Nevada in 1896 by a local resident who named it in
honor of populist William Jennings Bryan's presidential campaign
proposal for a fixed silver-to-gold price ratio.</TE>
<TE>   Known as a pocket mine for its jewel-like concentrations of
high-grade ore, the mine prospered on and off until 1965 when it was
effectively closed, then mined only sporadically by locals who leased
the claims.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was running a bar in Santa Barbara when he first visited
the mine in 1974. It was the same year that the federal government
allowed gold, long fixed at $35 a troy ounce, to trade on the open
market. The price soared, exceeding $800 an ounce by 1980.</TE>
<TE>   He seized control of the company that owned the Sixteen to One in
1983 after a spirited six-year proxy battle, becoming its chief
executive. At first, Miller leased the mining claims to a series of
exploration companies. When they pulled out in 1991, Miller took over
day-to-day operations.</TE>
<TE>   A series of multimillion-dollar finds followed. The company rolled
much of its profits back into mine improvements, Miller said, and
began acquiring other mining properties. But in recent years, the
Sixteen to One has fallen on hard times.</TE>
<TE>   The company's prized collection of gold specimens and carved
gold-laced quartz is up for sale. Last month, its stock was delisted
from the Pacific Stock Exchange for consistently trading below a
dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding Miller's financial troubles has been a growing pile of
safety and environmental citations.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, he was ordered to monitor an arsenic discharge, and
ultimately reduce it to required drinking water standards. After he
failed to turn in an arsenic reduction plan or pay more than $27,000
in overdue fines and permit fees, his case was referred to the state
attorney general's office, a deputy attorney general said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the mine is struggling.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's workforce, reduced now to a crew of six, makes its daily
trek a half-mile into the earth beneath Kanaka Creek Canyon. There,
the men use metal detectors and dynamite in their quest for another
payload.</TE>
<TE>   The men check pumps that suck water from the mine's lower levels,
exposing what they hope will be another rich vein.</TE>
<TE>   By midafternoon, they emerge squinting from the portal, the day's
take of gold-laced quartz stuffed inside one dirty tube sock.</TE>
<TE>   They split the proceeds from the communal haul. Recently, that has
come to little more than $3 an hour per man.</TE>
<TE>   Today, even people sympathetic to Miller's cause suggest it may be
time to let go of a way of life that is more trouble than it is
worth.</TE>
<TE>   "In the underground small operation that was popular from 1850
right up until five or six years ago, there are just a few hardheaded
people left," said Donald Dickey, who shut down his own gold mine
here earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   "There will always be people beating their heads against rock.
That's gone on since biblical times. But it won't be a viable
industry as such."</TE>
<TE>   The county's economy once depended almost exclusively on mining
and logging, but it has been decades since mining was a significant
economic force here. Logging too, is a shadow of its former self,
with the last sawmill recently shuttered. Government now employs more
than 40% in this county of 3,100.</TE>
<TE>   "As a resource-based economy, it's completely dead," said Sierra
County Sheriff Lee Adams, an amateur local historian. "Mike is just
an artifact."</TE>
<TE>   Miller is undaunted. Gold-mining allows him to wrest a commodity
from the earth and create wealth, he said. The experience is a "dream
for a lot of boy-men," he said. Today, he defends what's left of the
dream with Old West bluster and an ivory-handled .38 pistol tucked in
his waistband.</TE>
<TE>   He says he's been targeted as part of a "rural cleansing" campaign
against miners, loggers, ranchers and other old-fashioned country
folk.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sixteen to One miners face extinction, and they represent the
last of the deep hard-rock guys," Miller said. "It's a symbol to a
lot of people, and I don't want it to die."</TE>

<LD>For Penny Breshears, the spiral into poverty began when her truck
took its last pitiful breath.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve years ago, Breshears, her husband and her daughter were
hopscotching the West Coast in search of a better life, selling oil
paintings and T-shirts from the back of an old trailer. At Lake
Elsinore, the truck's transmission went.</LD>
<LD>   At about the same time, Breshears had a stroke and the family had
to sell everything, just to get her into a hospital. After a long
recovery, her husband left. Unable to afford rent, eventually she was
evicted.</LD>
<TE>   The years had taken their toll. By June, Breshears, 48, and her
17-year-old daughter, Chantel Decker, were homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the Children's Fund of San Bernardino County, an
organization dedicated to serving the needs of people who fall
through the cracks.</TE>
<TE>   The Children's Fund is being featured as part of the annual Los
Angeles Times Holiday Campaign, which granted the organization
$15,000 from last year's fund-raising effort.</TE>
<TE>   After spending four months in shelters for the homeless, Breshears
finally scraped together enough money to move to an apartment.</TE>
<TE>   But life isn't easy. In lieu of curtains, sheets of cardboard are
taped over the windows. Mother and daughter live on $719 a month --
benefits Decker receives because her father is dead, a suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Rent eats up most of it, and Breshears has $25 in the bank.</TE>
<TE>   But they have a roof over their heads, largely because of the
Children's Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The organization got them a refrigerator and a bed. The group
helped get Decker enrolled at a local high school, where she is
earning good grades.</TE>
<TE>   It bought Decker's school supplies and the uniform she needs to
carry a flag in the marching band.</TE>
<TE>   And an advocate for disadvantaged families whom Breshears met
through the Children's Fund gave her a ride recently to the San
Manuel casino so she could apply for a job.</TE>
<TE>   "They are with you for the duration," Breshears said. "We're
living on less than a shoestring, I guess you could say. They've been
a real blessing."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, relying largely on about $1 million in private
donations, the Children's Fund helped 33,000 children, said Executive
Director Bonnie O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   Assistance comes in many forms, from a donated crib to emergency
rent aid.</TE>
<TE>   The fund also operates a school for homeless kids. During the
holidays, the fund acts as a clearinghouse for donated toys. Each
year, it sets up shop in a donated collection point.</TE>
<TE>   This year the Loma Linda University Medical Center offered part of
an old laundry facility.</TE>
<TE>   In conjunction with other organizations, including the Marines,
the Children's Fund distributes the toys to poor children.</TE>

<HD>Saving Japanese American History</HD>
<DH>Survivors of World War II internment camps will gather at
museum to share their stories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Tamaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daisy Uyeda Satoda, who spent her high school years at the Topaz
internment camp in Utah, now spends her days rushing to chronicle her
experience and that of her classmates before the memories slip away.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been losing so many members" of the Topaz High School class
of 1945, Uyeda Satoda said. "That's why we want to get things into
print."</LD>
<LD>   Sixty years have passed since the U.S. government banished 120,000
people of Japanese descent to camps. Survivors will gather in Los
Angeles this week to ponder ways of ensuring that history does not
forget them.</LD>
<TE>   The former internees and their supporters have used books, movies
and museums to chronicle their story, both for future generations of
Japanese Americans and for the broader public.</TE>
<TE>   But one of the most potent tools for recounting the events is
vanishing: living survivors. Officials at the Japanese American
National Museum, who are organizing the weekend gathering of
survivors from all 10 camps, have scaled back attendance estimates
from 800 people to 650.</TE>
<TE>   "Health considerations and the passing of so many former inmates
has definitely affected the event," said Chris Komai, a museum
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Time is also bearing down on officials of Densho, a Seattle-based
group compiling a digital archive of videotaped interviews of camp
survivors. They will showcase their work at the gathering.</TE>
<TE>   "A number of people in our archives have passed away," said
Patricia Kiyono of Densho, a Japanese term that means to pass on to
the next generation. "So that is an impetus for us to continue our
work."</TE>
<TE>   This year includes the museum's 10th anniversary and the 60th
anniversary of the date, Feb. 19, 1942, when President Franklin D.
Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the evacuation
from the West Coast of all people of Japanese ancestry.</TE>
<TE>   Museum officials don't know how many survivors are still alive.</TE>
<TE>   A count taken after the U.S. government formally apologized and
offered to redress some of the economic losses suffered by those who
were interned found nearly 80,000 living survivors. But that was in
1988.</TE>
<TE>   A reunion of survivors and spouses of the Manzanar camp attracted
800 people in 1980. Another this year drew 200.</TE>
<TE>   "We can surmise and write all the books we want but we did not
survive the camp experience," said Patricia Wolfe, treasurer of the
Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation, a group dedicated to recounting
the experience of the Japanese Americans held at the Heart Mountain
internment camp. "For these people to tell their grandchildren and
other generations what it was like to live in 17-degrees-below-zero
weather, you need their actual oral history."</TE>
<TE>   Survivors will share some of their experiences at the gathering
Friday through Sunday at the Japanese American National Museum and
Westin Bonaventure Hotel. Other workshops will focus on ways to
preserve their stories and the camps that spawned them.</TE>
<TE>   The need for the gathering is clear to Babe Karasawa, who was in a
camp in Poston, Ariz., with his family.</TE>
<TE>   Now a volunteer at the museum in Little Tokyo, Karasawa regularly
encounters tours of schoolchildren who have never heard of the
internment. He also comes across adults who are aware of the
internment, but possess little knowledge of what it entailed.</TE>
<TE>   "We find people who are really shocked by what they learn,"
Karasawa said.</TE>
<TE>   Karasawa and Uyeda Satoda plan to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Karasawa is helping to plan a panel of former internees who will
read excerpts from their 1981 testimony before a congressional panel
that considered redress and reparations for Japanese Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Uyeda Satoda will connect with former classmates to work on the
book they are writing about their high school experience at the Topaz
camp.</TE>
<TE>   Including lessons on the internment in school curriculums for
today's students will be the topic of several workshops.</TE>
<TE>   In California, state academic standards cover the internment. But
in Washington state, individual districts decide whether to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Densho, the Seattle group, offers lessons on its Web site, in
addition to access to its archives. The hope is that the lessons will
wind up in classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not just preserving the materials," Kiyono said. "We're
working hard to ensure they are taught in schools, with a larger
focus placed on civil liberties and the constitutional issues that
surround the internment."</TE>
<TE>   Teaching survivors and their offspring the meanings of seemingly
mundane objects -- ranging from immigration documents to wooden
sculptures crafted during the camp years -- is the aim of a workshop
titled "How Objects Speak: Telling History Through Artifacts."</TE>
<TE>   "They don't necessarily mean anything in and of themselves, but
they do put a human face on larger events," said Sojin Kim, an
associate curator at the Japanese American National Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Enticing younger generations of Japanese Americans to carry on the
legacy of the internment is a key thrust of the summit.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully the sansei [third-generation Japanese Americans] and
the yonsei [fourth-generation] will continue to tell the story," said
Eddy Kurushima, who spent time at the Jerome internment camp in
Arkansas before entering the service. "But after that, I don't know
what will happen."</TE>

<HD>2nd Mailer Attacks Villaraigosa's Private Life</HD>
<DH>Flier calls candidate for council a 'womanizer.' Mayor Hahn
asks that campaign be stopped.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tina Daunt</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raising the stakes in a campaign to represent the Eastside, a
supporter of Los Angeles Councilman Nick Pacheco sent out a second
attack mailer over the weekend against challenger Antonio
Villaraigosa, accusing the one-time mayoral candidate of being a
"womanizer."</LD>
<LD>   The mailer, which was financed by a longtime Pacheco backer,
Ricardo Torres, names Villaraigosa's alleged mistress, accuses the
former state Assembly Speaker of infidelity and attacks his family
members. The piece asks: "Will you allow the 14th Council District to
become one of Antonio Villaraigosa's one night stands?"</LD>
<LD>   Although Pacheco, who will face Villaraigosa in the March
election, has said previously that he intended to call Villaraigosa's
character into question during the campaign, he disavowed the
mailers. He said he has told Torres to stop his efforts, but has
received no assurances that he would.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel like Ricardo is being an idiot," Pacheco said. "I'm very
upset."</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa, meanwhile, said he held Pacheco personally
responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "Nick Pacheco and his campaign owe my family an apology for
invading their privacy and for attacking their character," he said.
"Voters of Los Angeles are tired and disgusted by these nasty
intimidation tactics. It's time for Mr. Pacheco to get out of the
gutter and talk about the issues that are important to the people of
the 14th Council District."</TE>
<TE>   The slick flier began arriving Saturday at households in Boyle
Heights, Highland Park, Eagle Rock, Mount Washington and surrounding
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Two days earlier, Torres sent out a leaflet accusing Villaraigosa
of ignoring needs of Hispanic constituents at the urging of "white
advisors" and "gringos."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Mayor James K. Hahn, who defeated Villaraigosa in
the 2001 mayoral race, said the mayor is continuing to support
Pacheco's reelection bid, but he wants the attack ads to stop.</TE>
<TE>   "This type of campaigning is not appropriate," said Deputy Mayor
Matt Middlebrook. "We are going to talk to Nick Pacheco and his
campaign and let him know that the mayor won't be part of a campaign
that engages in these kinds of tactics."</TE>
<TE>   Torres, a personal injury attorney who went to law school with
Pacheco, has promised to issue two attack mailers against
Villaraigosa each week until Villaraigosa abandons the race against
Pacheco. He plans to raise $500,000 from Villaraigosa's foes to
finance the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   He did not return calls for comment on Sunday, but in an interview
on Friday, Torres said he was preparing to hire a private
investigator to help find material.</TE>
<TE>   William Wardlaw, one of Hahn's advisors, said he is "a firm
believer in hardball politics, not sleazy politics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's stupid. It's despicable. It's bad politics," said Wardlaw,
who supports Pacheco. "I hope this stops or it's going to be hard to
support Nick."</TE>

<HD>With High Court OK, Family Sues an HMO</HD>
<DH>Strictly to save money, a Costa Mesa man wasn't told of a
lung transplant option, his survivors say. They also sue a Newport
Beach doctors group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The widow and children of a disabled Costa Mesa man are suing a
health maintenance organization and a Newport Beach doctors group,
alleging that the patient wasn't told he was a candidate for a lung
transplant because it would have cost too much.</LD>
<LD>   The case, set for trial in Santa Ana this week, raises questions
about how a doctor decides what treatment is appropriate for a
patient whose HMO will pay only a certain amount for care.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, on behalf of George McCall, is already creating
headaches for the managed care industry. The state Supreme Court
ruled in the case last year that Medicare patients may sue HMOs that
deny them necessary but expensive treatments that Medicare will not
pay for. The decision clears the way for survivors of McCall -- and
other elderly and disabled patients and their survivors -- to sue
health providers. Previously, those complaints had to be heard in an
administrative proceeding.</LD>
<TE>   McCall, who owned a furniture manufacturing company, died in 1999,
three hours after finally having the transplant surgery at UC San
Diego. He was 58.</TE>
<TE>   His family contends that if the transplant had been recommended
years earlier by PacifiCare of California and Dr. Lakshmi Shukla of
Greater Newport Physicians Inc., he would have been healthy enough to
withstand the operation.</TE>
<TE>   "How can it not be sitting in the back of their mind that 'This is
costing us $300,000?' " Carol Jimenez, one of the McCall family
attorneys, said of the lung transplant's cost.</TE>
<TE>   In briefs filed in Orange County Superior Court, lawyers for
PacifiCare and Shukla said McCall was never denied a lung transplant
and that he, not the doctor or the HMO, made the decision not to have
the operation. Attorneys for Shukla and Greater Newport did not
return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shukla's attorneys wrote that McCall had the impression that lung
transplant patients had a low survival rate and that he told the
doctor that he wouldn't consider a lung transplant "unless he was
confined to bed rest and it was absolutely a last resort."</TE>
<TE>   McCall family attorneys, however, said the doctor never provided
the patient with correct information on the mortality rate for lung
transplants. They also said there was no mention in McCall's medical
records that Shukla ever recommended the operation.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got a patient this sick and he's refusing the only
treatment option available, wouldn't you document it?" Jimenez said.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Balisok, another McCall family attorney, said the patient
should have been put on the transplant waiting list in 1995. With the
normal two-year wait, he would have undergone the operation in 1997
instead of when he was too weak to survive, the attorney said. "He'd
be alive today," Balisok said.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Kominski, associate director of the UCLA Center for Health
Policy Research, said that by their nature, HMOs have a conflict of
interest involving patients' medical decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to balance the trade-offs between medical necessity and
the financial incentive to provide the least amount of care
necessary," he said. "This is the world of managed care."</TE>
<TE>   The McCalls' lawyers said they will ask the court for an
injunction to require PacifiCare and other HMOs to disclose to
patients how treatment options affect a doctor's profits.</TE>
<TE>   "The injunction would be a remarkable thing if we got it," Balisok
said. "It would take a fairly courageous judge."</TE>
<TE>   McCall had the lung disease alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a
genetic disorder in which the body doesn't produce enough protein for
cell regeneration and repair, causing severe emphysema. His problems
were exacerbated by long-term smoking.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, McCall enrolled in an HMO that PacifiCare offered for
Medicare patients. Shukla, his pulmonologist, was a member of Greater
Newport Physicians, a medical group the plan offered.</TE>
<TE>   According to the suit, Medicare paid PacifiCare a monthly fee for
every patient in the program, regardless of how much care they
required.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, McCall's condition worsened, and he underwent
experimental treatments that were supposed to cost $60,000 total. But
with complications, they cost the defendants nearly $300,000, about
equal to a lung transplant.</TE>
<TE>   The McCalls said they didn't consider a transplant until 1997,
when George McCall was in Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in
Newport Beach with life-threatening pneumonia. A temporary nurse
happened to ask him where he stood on the transplant waiting list.
She also said the transplant results were much better than he had
thought, the attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the first time since 1989 that George and Barbara had
heard mention of a transplant as an option," the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also alleges that Shukla told McCall that to get the
transplant at UC San Diego, he would have to drop out of PacifiCare.
The lawyers said it is illegal to force a patient to leave an HMO to
get treatment.</TE>
<TE>   McCall, however, did drop out of the plan and spent two years on
the transplant list.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, his wife said, he was on a ventilator and needed
24-hour care.</TE>
<TE>   "His last two years were a total hell," she said.</TE>

three hours later. His family says he had been too weakened by that

<KH>Orange Peeled A LOOK AT LIFE INSIDE THE COUNTY</KH>
<HD>It'll Crop Up Again -- but Where?</HD>
<DH>Tanaka Farms fruit stand, which had lost its longtime site
in Cypress, may be uprooted again. But the faithful will follow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stanley Allison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a sure sign that fall is here and winter is just around the
corner: Tanaka Farms' fruit and vegetable stand in Cypress, a fixture
on Katella Avenue for almost 40 years, folds its tent, packs up the
strawberry flags and banners, and puts everything away until
mid-March.</LD>
<LD>   The trick, lately, is finding the stand when March rolls around.</LD>
<LD>   After being forced to move from its longtime location on Katella
near Valley View Street in 2001, Tanaka Farms, which closed for the
winter Oct. 31, is facing another eviction notice from the owners of
the land near the Los Alamitos Race Course.</LD>
<TE>   The owners of the 7-acre parcel, nestled between a new Marriott
Residence Inn to the west and the racetrack to the north, are
negotiating to sell it to a developer.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping we'll be in the same spot," said Glenn Tanaka, 46.</TE>
<TE>   But he knows that rapid development along Katella leaves little
room for roadside produce stands.</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka Farms, however, is not just any roadside stand. It's a
neighborhood icon that sells more than 40 types of fruits and
vegetables the family grows on 50 acres of farmland leased from the
Irvine Co. in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   And just as Tanaka Farms is a fixture in the community, Aimee
Buck, manager, is a fixture at Tanaka Farms.</TE>
<TE>   Once she gets started talking about the blessings of fresh fruit
and organically grown vegetables, it's hard to stop her. She lives
for this. She can talk about it forever.</TE>
<TE>   "You name it, we have it. We have strawberries, apples, bananas,
bell peppers, all the berries, broccoli, cabbage, carrots,
cauliflower, celery, Anaheim chiles, and our white corn is to die
for."</TE>
<TE>   So, Aimee, what about ....</TE>
<TE>   "Wait, there's more. We have eggplant, cucumber, grapes and all
the lettuce. Melons, onions. We have Maui-type onions. They're grown
here, so you can't call them Maui onions. We have some that are as
big as your head. You ever barbecue onions? You make an X on the top,
put on a slice of butter, put it in some foil -- oh, God, it's like
eating onion soup."</TE>
<TE>   This is what her customers have come to expect from Buck, 49, who
has run the stand since the Tanakas took it over in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   For eight months of the year, seven days a week, Buck is like a
good-earth minister, preaching the power of fresh produce. The fact
that it all takes place under a tent makes shopping at Tanaka Farms
sort of like a revival meeting for lovers of fresh produce.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to know how many calories, what's the vitamin
content. So I wrote a little book. It's my life. I love it," Buck
said.</TE>
<TE>   Customers also love it. Some travel great distances just for a
taste of Tanaka's produce. "We have people who come from Mammoth to
buy our strawberries. One customer comes from San Bernardino every
two weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Buck says she asked the customer once if she had a doctor or some
other important reason in town for making the trek. Nope, just Tanaka
Farms.</TE>
<TE>   But how long can it last? With farmland disappearing under housing
tracts and business declining in Cypress about 20% in the last four
years, a roadside stand seems to be an endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see it in stores now," Tanaka said. "There are prepared
salads, the vegetables are pre-cut. They're fresh, but the work is
already done. It's a trend. Everybody's busy."</TE>
<TE>   Busy or not, some people still prefer the results from cooking and
eating fresh, organically grown fruits and vegetables. "Store
strawberries are not as good," said Linda Negron, 37, of Los
Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   "They're more fresh" at Tanaka Farms, said Kayoko MacInness, who
lives nearby. She said the farm is more convenient: "You drive up and
walk right in. Supermarkets are more crowded. The service is poorer."</TE>
<TE>   At Tanaka Farms, "if the melons aren't ripe, they'll say come back
tomorrow," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka Farms started in Irvine more than 25 years ago. The family
opened stands in Westminster, Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley.
They then took over a little stand at Katella and Valley View in the
late 1980s. The Irvine and Cypress stands are the only ones that
remain. At first, they sold just strawberries. Then tomatoes, corn
and the rest were added. But to this day, the stand is still most
famous for its strawberries.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no rushing perfection. Strawberry lovers are at the
mercy of the plants. That's why the owners can't even give an exact
reopening date for the stand. It depends on when the first
strawberries are ready for harvest.</TE>
<TE>   So the faithful keep their eyes peeled for the big sign Buck puts
out at the site announcing the opening date. "It's all up to Mother
Nature," Buck said. It's usually around the second week of March.</TE>
<TE>   Buck swoons as she describes that first week, those first berries:
"The ones that are the first picked are the sweetest ever."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the season, from March to June, the strawberries are
picked that morning and sold that day.</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka Farms sell about 1,500 pounds of strawberries a day at the
Cypress stand during season, Tanaka said.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are good that Tanaka will find some spot in Cypress or
nearby Los Alamitos next March, and the mailing list will keep many
customers informed of their whereabouts and opening date.</TE>
<TE>   For up-to-date information, they suggest checking their Web site,
www.tanakafarms.com, which could prevent a repeat of the experience
of Raymond Beaty of Lakewood.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked for 'em for a year and a half," he said.</TE>

<HD>Celebrated Pianist's Songbook Fills 13-Hour Library Show</HD>
<DH>Roger Williams plays 400 requests during a 13-hour Nixon
birthplace performance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The silky notes were as kisses to the audience Sunday as famed
"pianist to the presidents" Roger Williams celebrated his 78th
birthday with a 13-hour ivory-tickling marathon at the Richard Nixon
Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda.</LD>
<LD>   Among the tunes he played were several renditions of "Happy
Birthday," as well as an unnamed song written by Nixon himself and
performed only once before: on Jack Paar's television show in 1963.</LD>
<LD>   "Just Nixon played it," Williams said, "and not very well."</LD>
<TE>   The level of performance was elevated considerably on Sunday,
however, as Williams -- who claims to know 10,000 songs by heart --
played about 400 requests from an audience that organizers estimated
would top 1,000 listeners by the end of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so grateful that people still want to come and listen to me,"
said Williams, who in a career spanning 47 years has performed for
eight American presidents, recorded 115 albums and has a star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   The custom of celebrating his birthday with marathon concerts
began three years ago with an appearance in Phoenix, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year he played for 12 1/2 hours at the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library near Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   And he plans to best this year's 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.
extravaganza with an even longer performance next year at Jimmy
Carter's presidential library in Georgia, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We older people are pretty much discarded by society," said
Williams, wearing tan slacks and a colorful shirt.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't feel that we have anything left."</TE>
<TE>   The concert, he said, was aimed at changing such impressions.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel better than I ever have," the pianist said.</TE>
<TE>   "The message is 'Don't write us off.' "</TE>
<TE>   Members of the audience certainly didn't seem to be doing that as
they sang along, clapped and hummed to apparently seamless medleys of
tunes ranging from "On Wisconsin" to Williams' more famous renditions
of "Autumn Leaves" and "Rhapsody in Blue."</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," said Tom Campbell, 70, of Huntington Beach. "He's
playing all the tunes I know."</TE>
<TE>   It was especially appropriate that the performance take place at
the Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace, executive director John H. Taylor
said, because "we have ancestral links to Mr. Williams," who played
several times for Nixon, both in and out of office.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent performance, he said, was at the opening of the
library itself in 1990, after which he donated the Steinway piano on
which Sunday's concert was performed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A guy can dream, can't he?</LD>
<LD>   The official state of California Web site, which carried election
results as they came in, was running its tests before the big night,
and according to the fake results run through the system:</LD>
<LD>   Incumbents were turned out by the score. Third parties swept
entire counties. Judges were tossed off the bench, and nearly every
proposition was voted down.</LD>
<TE>   Most interestingly, the tests had Bill Simon leading Gray Davis by
about 460,000 votes, with 96% of the vote counted.</TE>
<TE>   If there were no other way to tell that this was only a test, and
entirely fictitious, it was the figure showing about a 97% voter
turnout. Dream on.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin's Letters Reveal Reaction to Jail</TE>
<TE>   The Libertarian and Druid who just pulled a cool 2% in his
campaign for governor says he was pen pals with Irv Rubin, the Jewish
Defense League leader. Rubin last week was said to have attempted
suicide on his way to court for allegedly plotting to blow up a
mosque and the California offices of Carlsbad Republican Rep. Darrell
Issa.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin wrote to Gary D. Copeland that he was "in hell" and
understood why Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh ("may he rot
forever") chose death over prison. In his isolation cell, Rubin said
he had nothing to read but "old dated magazines like Road and Track
and Popular Mech[anics]." One day "in the hole" was like a thousand.
"I'm literally a political prisoner," Rubin wrote. "I will wait to
see if this letter reaches you before I write again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the last Rubin letter Copeland received.</TE>
<TE>   A Personal Stake in Transportation Issue</TE>
<TE>   Now that's bipartisanship:</TE>
<TE>   The California Capitol Hill Bulletin reports that 16 California
members of Congress have written to Transportation Secretary Norm
Mineta asking him for an exemption to allow nonstops to fly between
the urban Washington Reagan National Airport and LAX.</TE>
<TE>   This would mean that legislators facing those looooong flights to
the West Coast wouldn't have to take that looooong ride out into
Virginia to Dulles airport to catch the L.A. nonstops; they'd just
have to leap into a cab for the dash from Capitol Hill, all the
better to get home earlier for a weekend with the family or
constituents -- or the fund-raisers. Maybe they're counting on the
fact that Mineta understands their plight: He was once a California
congressman himself.</TE>
<TE>   State Party Chairman Would Like to Rephrase</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Steel, the besieged but genial chairman of California's
Republican Party, was up late election night, and on Pasadena public
radio station KPCC when asked about the possible Democratic sweep of
Sacramento offices.</TE>
<TE>   "Giving all power to one party invites nothing but tyranny and
corruption.... Everybody recognizes that," he proclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   When it was pointed out to him that his own party now holds
one-party control in Washington, D.C., Steel said with a laugh,
"You've really got me caught in my own rhetoric."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Snuggles Up to Some Heavy Hitters</TE>
<TE>   Some politicians worry about protecting their base; others worry
about covering the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's just-reelected uber-mayor, Larry Agran, once a Democratic
presidential candidate and perennially a punching bag for Orange
County's GOP, appeared on a preelection slate mailer that made his
rivals blanch: Front and center, in full color, was Agran shaking
hands with ... George W. Bush, a photo apparently taken during Bush's
August visit to Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   That very same day, some Democratic voters reported receiving a
recorded telephone exhortation to voters to cast their ballots for
Agran -- a message from a Democratic U.S. senator and another
favorite GOP punching bag, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   The Quackenbushes, Slightly Ascendant</TE>
<TE>   The name Quackenbush has pretty much departed the California
scene, after former Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush, facing
impeachment and a criminal investigation in a political corruption
scandal, quit the job.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Chris -- whose failed 1998 campaign for state
Senate was bankrolled by $175,000 in contributions made to her
husband by insurance interests -- moved to Hawaii. Chris Q.'s name
appeared on a letter to the editor in the Honolulu Advertiser on
Halloween. She identified herself as a businessperson, praising Linda
Lingle, the GOP nominee for governor, and slamming Hawaii's Democrats
as responsible for "prevalent corruption," among other failings.</TE>
<TE>   On election night, the Quackenbushes were spotted at Lingle's
victory party. The Quackenbushes probably remember that "aloha" means
both "goodbye" and "hello."</TE>
<TE>   Fancy in Name but Otherwise the Same</TE>
<TE>   Angelenos voted last week not to let bits of their city defect
from the body politic, but two neighborhoods that never put it to a
vote are staying in the fold and are making sure all the other cattle
know they're there.</TE>
<TE>   In the optimistic tradition of settlements called River Oaks that
possess neither river nor oaks, the L.A. City Council voted to allow
a culturally and historically distinct neighborhood bounded by
Vermont Avenue, Figueroa Street, 120th Street and El Segundo
Boulevard to be known as Athens on a Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Residents supposedly refer to the area that way among themselves,
even though in terms of altitude, says one City Hall-er, it's more a
bump than a hill.</TE>
<TE>   Ditto East Hollywood, where a neighborhood bordered by Western
Avenue, Melrose Avenue, the Hollywood Freeway, Santa Monica Boulevard
and Ardmore Avenue will henceforth be known as Melrose Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Job insecurity: GOP Rep. Steve Horn, redistricted out of his
seat and soon to leave Congress, announced not long before last
week's election that he had hired two new staff members, one in
Washington and the other in Lakewood.</TE>
<TE>   * Democratic State Sen. Sheila Kuehl will be honored at a Thursday
evening gala by the UCLA women's studies programs and the UCLA Center
for the Study of Women with the first Women's Community Action Award.
Former National Organization for Women President Patricia Ireland is
the guest host.</TE>
<TE>   * Ben Austin, a former Clinton White House aide, former deputy
mayor to Richard Riordan and now spokesman for Rob Reiner, is engaged
to Tracy Olmstead. The couple first met on Halloween during Clinton's
1992 campaign, and met again in the White House. The wedding's in
2003 -- maybe on Halloween. The bride-to-be is a fund-raiser for Gray
Davis -- does this mean she is now out of work?</TE>
<TE>   * Closed captioning on television is always an approximate process
of rendering spoken into written words, and on election night, closed
captioning for Los Angeles station KCAL-TV Channel 9 rendered "Valley
secession" as "Valerie secession," and Arnold Schwarzenegger as
"Schwarz-negative."</TE>
<TE>   * File this under "what ifs": Political gossip has it that back in
January or February, the White House was so eager to see former L.A.
Mayor Richard Riordan win the California gubernatorial primary that
there were negotiations about Bill Simon getting out of the race to
take the No. 2 job in the new Homeland Security office. But the
possible offer supposedly fell through when Homeland Security chief
Tom Ridge had a wobbly start, and the idea of a political fledgling
like Simon in the second chair changed some minds. The rest, like the
Simon campaign itself now, is history.</TE>

<HD>Thrills in Store on Safer Track</HD>
<DH>Police in San Diego crack down on street races, but set up
a legal venue for those who can't give up the rush of competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Garrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Nothing -- not the fiery crash that killed his closest friend, not
his beautiful baby son, certainly not the police -- can make Edgar
Gomez give up drag racing.</LD>
<LD>   The black pavement glistening in the moonlight, the beat of his
own heart kicking into high gear, the incredible burst of speed, the
intense focus when his foot hits the accelerator -- to him, it's the
best feeling in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Luckily for Gomez, the San Diego Police Department understands
this -- to a point. As part of its program against street racing, the
city lets him and other speed addicts race in certain spots, such as
Qualcomm Stadium, under supervision.</LD>
<TE>   For those who don't get the message, the police have an undercover
unit -- believed to be the only one of its kind in the state --
devoted to stamping out the illegal pastime. They also have stiff
penalties for racers and spectators.</TE>
<TE>   There have been 13 deaths related to drag racing in San Diego
County this year. Last month the San Diego City Council voted
unanimously to make watching an illegal race a crime, punishable by a
fine of $1,000 or as much as six months in jail.</TE>
<TE>   The city joined a host of other jurisdictions, including the city
and county of Los Angeles, that have enacted such laws in recent
months to combat a rise in street carnage. But officials in San Diego
say their program goes further.</TE>
<TE>   "Enforcement over the course of history has not worked," said
William Maheu, assistant police chief of San Diego. So officials have
pushed legal racing as an alternative, enlisting the parents of
children killed in crashes to help make the case that it is just as
satisfying to race in a stadium as in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say their strategy is a success. One year ago, it was
not unusual for police to break up races that had drawn 1,200 cars
and 3,000 spectators. Now, many illegal races draw fewer than 50
cars. Police hope that number will continue to drop now that it is a
crime even to watch, and that drivers will find racing without an
audience no fun.</TE>
<TE>   Observers agree that the program has had a chilling effect, but
they say it is unlikely to wipe out the problem. The number of deaths
and injuries this year -- including a crash that killed two
bystanders last month -- underscores that.</TE>
<TE>   "I think their efforts are very good," said Charlie McCracken, who
runs the Web site SDStreetracing.com. "But I just don't think it will
solve any problems."</TE>
<TE>   Racing, he said, "is never going to stop."</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, police and community leaders operate on the
assumption that getting into a car and punching the accelerator is
not inherently wrong, but that doing it on city streets is. It's now
easier to find a place to race legally in San Diego than almost
anywhere else in California -- and the chances of getting caught and
punished for doing it illegally are much higher, police say.</TE>
<TE>   The penalties are harsh. Last month, police said, George Waller
Jr. was charged with murder after he allegedly killed two teenagers
whose car crossed the path of his speeding car. Officials say it is
the first murder charge related to drag racing in San Diego County's
history.</TE>
<TE>   The carrot-and-stick approach is being watched by authorities as
far away as Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "Drag racing has been going on since the first two Model-Ts came
off Henry Ford's assembly line," said Stephen Bender, a professor of
public health at San Diego State University. "We're saying 'Look,
that's fine. The need for speed is there. Take it to a safer venue.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Bender, who confesses to speeding in his own youth down empty
country roads, began studying drag racing as a public health issue in
1997, when he noticed how many kids were dying in car crashes. He got
a $2-million grant from the state Office of Traffic Safety and in
1998 began spending 20-hour days setting up the race course at
Qualcomm Stadium. Bender calls his program RaceLegal.com. It attracts
more than 2,000 spectators and 225 racers on Friday nights. They will
be racing every Friday night from now until the end of the year.
Racers have their cars checked, don helmets, sign liability waivers
and they're off -- racing as many as 20 times a night.</TE>
<TE>   Bender persuaded judges to send youngsters convicted of drag
racing to serve their probation under his tutelage. Some of them have
helped out at legal races. Despite these efforts, however, many still
prefer the illicit thrill of meeting at gas stations and cruising for
the perfect empty industrial park.</TE>
<TE>   So last year, with a $400,000 Traffic Safety grant, the San Diego
Police Department formed what it says is the nation's only unit
dedicated to wiping out illegal drag racing.</TE>
<TE>   Its undercover officers prowl the races with cameras and notebooks
and then arrest the racers later, often at home in front of their
parents. They also work with automotive experts to identify cars that
have been illegally souped up, and with city attorneys to prosecute
those they catch.</TE>
<TE>   Many racers say the police presence has pushed them off the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   "Trust me, a lot of people have quit racing because of that,"
Gomez said. "You can't spot them anymore," he added. "Before they had
Crown Victorias, and we'd be, like, 'We're not going to race in front
of you, buddy.' But now they've gotten smarter. Now they have
imports."</TE>
<TE>   Greg Sloan of San Diego's police dragnet unit declined to discuss
the department's strategy or details of the undercover operations.</TE>
<TE>   What he will talk about are the benefits of racing legally. Among
those, he listed one of the more painless methods of learning
chemistry and physics, and a highly effective anti-drug and alcohol
program.</TE>
<TE>   "It teaches you a lot," he said. Technical know-how is needed to
calculate how to modify a car to make it go faster, and lackluster
students suddenly begin boning up on math and physics to grasp
concepts like velocity and force, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People put so much time and energy into figuring it out that they
don't spend a whole lot of time when it comes to either drugs or
alcohol," Sloan said. He said he had seen only two bottles of beer in
an entire year of busting illegal races.</TE>
<TE>   Such benefits are lost on Peggy Klein Martinez, whose daughter
Rebeca died in a car crash in August when a friend took her to an
illegal race on their first date. Since her daughter's death,
Martinez has committed herself to raising money and lobbying to
create more places where kids can race legally under controlled
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   She has also been to almost every race at Qualcomm Stadium since
her daughter's death, joined by other parents whose children have
died. She does it, she said, so her daughter will not have died in
vain.</TE>
<TE>   "They offer the kids a place where they can go do this idiotic
thing legally and safely," she said. "If it's the very last thing I
ever do in my life, I will see a track built for these kids."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 26-year-old actor who was best known for playing the role of Romeo
on "The Steve Harvey Show" was shot to death Saturday morning as he
sat in a parked car in South Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Merlin Santana, who lived in North Hollywood, was in the passenger
seat of a car being driven by a friend in the 3800 block of Victoria
Avenue, investigators said.</LD>
<LD>   Police offered few details and said they did not know the motive.
They said the driver was not injured and that he drove about a
half-mile to Crenshaw and Exposition boulevards, where he flagged
down two officers.</LD>
<TE>   Paramedics were called, and they found Santana dead. The driver's
name was not released.</TE>
<TE>   Santana was nominated twice for NAACP Image Awards as a supporting
actor on "The Steve Harvey Show," a sitcom that ran for six years and
is now in syndication. In his role as Romeo, he was a high school
student and a smooth-talking ladies' man.</TE>
<TE>   Santana was born in New York City to immigrants from the Dominican
Republic. His first movie appearance was as an extra in Woody Allen's
"The Purple Rose of Cairo."</TE>
<TE>   He starred in the sitcom "Getting By" and the program "Under One
Roof." He appeared in many other series, including "The Cosby Show,"
"Moesha," "Law &amp; Order," "NYPD Blue" and "Hangin' With Mr. Cooper."
He also appeared in the movie "Showtime," with Robert De Niro and
Eddie Murphy.</TE>

<LD>   City officials are stuck with a $20,000 phone bill. AT&amp;T
investigators say hackers broke into the city's phone system and made
calls to the Philippines over five days in July.</LD>
<LD>   Officials believe the hacker gained access to a voicemail box pass
code. The system then was manipulated to allow calls placed to and
from the line.</LD>
<TE>   The city's typical monthly phone bill is about $10,000. In July,
it was $40,000. AT&amp;T will pay about $10,000 of the bill, but it says
the city is responsible for the rest.</TE>

<HD>At $35,000, Big Truffle Is Nothing to Trifle With</HD>
<DH>L.A. restaurateur pays a record price for one very large
specimen of the exotic white fungus.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Pytka, a 64-year-old director of television commercials, paid
$35,000 Sunday for a mushroom.</LD>
<LD>   Well, OK, it wasn't the kind of mushroom you'd buy in your local
supermarket. It was an enormous, 2.2-pound white truffle, the rare
and exotically perfumed tuber magnatum Pico hunted by specially
trained dogs in the Piedmont region of northwest Italy and prized by
gourmets throughout the world. And Pytka is not just a maker of TV
commercials -- albeit a hugely successful one. He is also the owner
of the newly opened French restaurant Bastide in West Hollywood,
where the truffle will be used in a variety of dishes made by chef
Alain Giraud.</LD>
<LD>   Pytka made his purchase -- at by far the highest price ever paid
for a single truffle -- during the fourth annual charity truffle
auction known as Asta Mondial del Tartufo Bianco d'Alba. He did so in
a lively bidding war with Tony May, the owner of San Domenico
restaurant in New York and -- a dog named Gunther IV, heir to a large
German fortune, whose bids were made by his owner, Maurizio Dial,
just as Pytka's bids were made by his 12-year-old daughter Arielle
(with Pytka prompting her from a seat alongside).</LD>
<TE>   This year, for the first time, the truffle auction was held
simultaneously in three places, linked by closed-circuit satellite
television. Pytka bid at Valentino restaurant in Santa Monica, where
75 other truffle aficionados were gathered, bidding paddles in hand
and wallets open for the recipients of all local proceeds -- the
Jonsson Cancer Center Foundation at UCLA and the families of the
victims of the recent earthquake that killed 26 schoolchildren in San
Giuliano di Puglia, about 140 miles southeast of Rome.</TE>
<TE>   May bid from his restaurant in New York, where a boisterous crowd
of 120 joined the action, and Gunther was at the castle of Grinzane
Cavour, just outside Alba, the home of the white truffle. A
standing-room-only crowd of 250 inside the castle was joined by 100
other human truffle-lovers gathered outside to follow the bidding.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 30 truffles were auctioned off -- 10 in each location. The
biggest truffle -- the one Pytka bought -- was in Alba. Its
appearance on the TV screen brought loud gasps of appreciation from
the crowd at Valentino. Most truffles weigh just a few ounces -- the
average of the 30 auctioned Sunday was about 9 ounces -- and Daniele
Bera of Funghi &amp; Tartufi, a truffle store in Alba, said Pytka's
truffle was the biggest he had seen in 17 years in the business.</TE>
<TE>   The truffle will be shipped to Pytka and should arrive Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles bidders dominated the proceedings, buying 15 of the 30
and paying $68,000 of the $126,000 total that was raised.</TE>
<TE>   The total far exceeded the $50,000 raised last year, and Pytka's
purchase nearly doubled the then record-setting $19,000 that Wolfgang
Puck of Spago paid last year for a 1.82-pound truffle.</TE>
<TE>   Bidding between New York and Los Angeles was spirited, driven in
part by the repeated proclamations by Robin Leach, of television's
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous," that New York is "the greatest
city in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Pytka said that, once Leach made the event a New York-versus-Los
Angeles rivalry, he was "prepared to spend whatever it took" to make
sure New York didn't win.</TE>
<TE>   Pytka said he also wanted the truffle to "challenge and inspire my
chef" and to make a statement as a new restaurateur.</TE>

<HD>Negative Campaign Repelled Some Voters</HD>
<DH>A Times exit poll finds alienation of Latinos and African
Americans also kept turnout low.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Z. Barabak</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A slashingly negative campaign and alienation among blacks and
Latinos combined to produce the record low turnout last week that
gave Gov. Gray Davis the political fright of his life. A lack of
competitive legislative and congressional races, as well as the
absence of substantive debate, also contributed to the widespread
apathy and estrangement, according to experts assessing the mass
voter boycott.</LD>
<LD>   "Usually, high turnout is built on hot issues and hot campaigns,"
said one political analyst, Antonio Gonzalez. "In this election we
had neither."</LD>
<LD>   A scant 44.9% -- or roughly 6.9 million people -- of California's
registered voters went to the polls Tuesday, according to the
secretary of state's office, which keeps the official tally. Roughly
750,000 absentee votes were cast; when those have been counted it is
expected that the turnout will rise to just about 50% of California's
15 million registered voters.</LD>
<TE>   That would be the lowest turnout in any statewide race since
reliable record keeping began in California in 1910. The previous low
was four years ago, when 58% of Californians showed up at the polls.</TE>
<TE>   The shrunken turnout also changed the makeup of Tuesday's
electorate from the one that gave Davis his first term in a 20-point
landslide in 1998. Davis won reelection against his badly battered
opponent, Los Angeles businessman Bill Simon Jr., by a
closer-than-expected 47% to 42%.</TE>
<TE>   The electorate Tuesday was much whiter and slightly more
Republican than in 1998, according to a Los Angeles Times exit poll.</TE>
<TE>   White voters made up 76% of the electorate, compared with 64% four
years ago. Democratic turnout declined slightly, from 48% to 46%, but
the percentages of Republicans and independents increased from 39% to
40% Republican and 8% to 10% independent.</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic shift came in the falloff of minority voters --
the Democratic base -- which also helps explain the dramatic drop in
Davis' support.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos declined from 13% of the electorate in 1998 to 10% on
Tuesday, the first drop in Latino turnout since it began steadily
rising in California in 1986. The falloff in the black vote was even
more dramatic, from 13% to 4% of the statewide electorate, according
to the exit poll. Translated, that means that roughly 800,000 fewer
African Americans and 350,000 fewer Latinos cast ballots Tuesday than
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The flagging of enthusiasm among core Democratic groups was most
evident in the high stay-at-home rates in the party strongholds of
Los Angeles, San Francisco and Alameda counties, where combined
turnout fell by more than 12% from 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Turnout in Republican counties also slipped, but the absent
Democratic voters and the decision of some party voters to side with
minor candidates combined to cut dramatically into the governor's
showing. Davis won 1.7 million fewer votes than he had in 1998,
before all the absentee ballots were counted, but Simon got only
about 400,000 fewer than the 1998 GOP nominee Dan Lungren.</TE>
<TE>   At least part of the reason for the falloff was a lack of serious
competition in the 113 legislative and congressional races across
California. That resulted from the redrawing of the state's political
boundaries in a bipartisan incumbent-protection plan, which
eliminated true competition in all but about a dozen of the contests
on Tuesday's ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "We always depend on the big races, especially where there's
congressional and legislative races in the same area, to push turnout
of our base constituencies," said Gale Kaufman, a Democratic
strategist involved Tuesday in several contests. "This time there
weren't enough of those to have any impact."</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say the biggest factor throwing a soggy blanket over
the electorate was the unremittingly negative tone of the campaign
waged by the two leading candidates for governor. In a testament to
their dubious achievement, Davis and Simon both ended the campaign
disliked by roughly six in 10 of those who bothered to vote,
according to the Times poll. Anecdotally, the distaste among those
who refused to vote was even more vehement.</TE>
<TE>   Strategy No Secret</TE>
<TE>   Strategists for Davis, who was widely unpopular heading into his
reelection campaign, made no secret of their strategy: Destroy his
opponent so that voters, however grudgingly, would see the incumbent
as a preferable alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, the mastermind of Davis' campaign, called the contest
"damaged goods versus defective product." So the governor and his
strategists "bludgeoned Simon with a blunt object, and it was not a
pretty sight," South said.</TE>
<TE>   But it proved devastatingly effective -- and greatly off-putting.</TE>
<TE>   Negative campaigning "just drops the mood of the electorate like a
rock," said Bruce Cain, director of UC Berkeley's Institute for
Governmental Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Although Democrats spent $9 million on get-out-the-vote efforts,
Cain pointed out, they spent tens of millions more on advertising
whose effect was "turning people off. Bottom line, if you spend more
money turning people off than turning people on, the turnout will go
down."</TE>
<TE>   Simon also had some complicity. While he called himself "the
candidate of ideas," the gist of his campaign was attacking Davis as
a corrupt governor, an assault he stepped up with a last blast of
advertising, after even his own strategists had told him he could not
win.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis said, 'Simon's a fascist.' Simon said, 'Davis is a crook.'
That was the campaign," said Gonzalez, president of the William C.
Velasquez Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on the
Latino community. "That's not very exciting for voters."</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a purple elephant's in the room," Gonzalez went on.
"The budget crisis, the education crisis, the health care crisis --
and we're sitting, having coffee, ignoring the purple elephant."</TE>
<TE>   There were also more specific gripes among key Democratic
constituencies.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has long been a political centrist, balancing his
environmentalism and support for abortion rights with a tough stance
on law-and-order issues and a generally pro-business attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Many Democrats were willing to overlook some areas of disagreement
when he first ran for governor -- after all, Republicans had held the
office for 16 years. But they were less forgiving once Davis took
over and failed to deliver on a liberal agenda, even though he had
never promised one.</TE>
<TE>   "That sort of ticked off all of us who thought we knew this guy
and he'd be true blue," said Alice Huffman, a Democratic activist of
more than 30 years. "He turned out to be a little different than we
anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' soured relations with the California Teachers Assn. are
illustrative.</TE>
<TE>   The labor group contributed $1.2 million to his 1998 campaign. But
alienated by the governor's push for standardized testing and other
disagreements over education policy, the association gave only
$62,000 to Davis' reelection effort, all but $10,000 of it early in
his term.</TE>
<TE>   More damaging still was the revelation from the association's
president, Wayne Johnson, that the governor had unsuccessfully sought
a $1 million contribution while discussing official business.</TE>
<TE>   Although the solicitation was not illegal, it damaged Davis' image
and fueled attacks on him as a "pay-to-play" governor, as Simon
frequently put it.</TE>
<TE>   In other policy areas, many African Americans felt the
governor had snubbed blacks in some of his early appointments and
stinted in his support for crime prevention programs.</TE>
<TE>   Also deeply rankling was his stance on racial profiling, said
Huffman, president of the state conference of the National Assn. for
the Advancement of Colored People.</TE>
<TE>   Despite strong lobbying, Davis vetoed a 1999 bill that would have
required local police to collect racial data, and then lobbied
against a second bill that was scrapped before reaching the Assembly
floor. Last year, a third racial profiling bill was stripped of any
data collection requirement at the behest of the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of us were disillusioned," Huffman said.</TE>
<TE>   Disenchanted Minorities</TE>
<TE>   Many black activists were also pragmatic, figuring that Davis was
better than Simon. "But it's hard to turn around to your troops and
say, 'OK, let's get to work,' " Huffman added. "They say, 'For this
guy?' "</TE>
<TE>   Although African Americans supported Davis in roughly the same
proportion as in 1998, with about eight in 10 backing the governor,
tens of thousands registered their feelings by choosing not to vote.</TE>
<TE>   A similar disenchantment was evident in the state's growing Latino
community.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of his administration, Davis clashed with Lt. Gov.
Cruz Bustamante, a fellow Democrat, over parking spaces and, more
seriously, immigration policy. Then, in the final weeks of the
campaign, Davis produced a backlash among some Latino leaders by
vetoing a bill to let illegal immigrants obtain state driver's
licenses if they applied for U.S. citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Simon's efforts to capitalize on their upset, Latino
voters stayed mostly loyal to Davis. But there was a notable
drop-off, not just in turnout, but also in the degree of Davis
support.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, 71% of Latinos voted for the Democrat, compared with 65%
on Tuesday. Green Party candidate Peter Camejo received 6% of the
Latino vote, with the rest going to other candidates.</TE>
<TE>"The same thing happened as with everyone else," Gonzalez said. "We
were offended by the brutally negative nature of the campaign. "So
people stayed home."</TE>

<LD>Mitch Albom in the Detroit Free Press: "No. No. A thousand red lights
no! New York City hosting the Olympic Games? Who came up with this
idea? Someone stuck in a taxi, trying to get across town? Yeah,
here's what we need. More ... people!</LD>
<LD>   " ... The city it beat out -- and I hope you're sitting down --
San Francisco. Right. Because when it comes to late August, where
would you rather be -- alongside a breezy Pacific Ocean or inhaling
bus fumes in 90-degree heat?</LD>
<LD>   "The official reason that the Big Apple was given the nod was that
it promised several billion dollars worth of improvements and an
Olympic village from which the average distance to a venue 'would be
no more than 6 miles.' Or in New York City traffic, three years."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: In what statistical category did former UCLA halfback
Jackie Robinson lead the NCAA in 1939 and 1940?</TE>
<TE>   They need Shaq: Barbara Barker of Newsday, on the struggling
Lakers: "You know all those wonderful, unsung Lakers such as Robert
Horry and Derek Fisher whom you hear about at playoff time? Well
there's a reason they're unsung for most of the year: Without Shaq in
the middle creating open shots, they aren't all that wonderful. The
two combined to hit 32 of their first 100 shots this season."</TE>
<TE>   Gloating: Mike Bianchi of the Orlando Sentinel, commenting on the
unbeaten Miami Hurricanes: "Other programs stumble and fall out of
step; Miami marches on. Other programs come and go; Miami just keeps
coming.</TE>
<TE>   "Florida State struggles to beat Wake Forest; Florida struggles to
beat Vanderbilt. Miami beats anybody and everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Understated: Bud Geracie in the San Jose Mercury News: "Speaking
of the Cubs, Dusty [Baker] said: 'They haven't had a lot of success
lately.' Yeah, like the last 94 years.</TE>
<TE>   * "Among the 30 teams in baseball, only one [Atlanta] has had the
same manager for more than eight seasons and only five haven't made a
change in the past five years."</TE>
<TE>   Hypocritical? Unlike other networks, NBC doesn't show a permanent
score box during football games. "NBC claims it doesn't want to ruin
the beauty of its pictures," said Steve Rosenbloom of the Chicago
Tribune. "This from the network that gave us the XFL."</TE>
<TE>   Simple solution: Pat Riley, after the Miami Heat gave up 100
points in the first two games: "You want to get it back to 70? I'll
get it back to 70 quick. It's easy to have a good defense in this
league -- you just don't shoot the ball and don't dribble it very
much."</TE>
<TE>   No more "D": Sam Cassell of the Milwaukee Bucks, after committing
three fouls in 43 seconds against the New York Knicks: "I caught
myself playing defense. Now I know what not to do. The more pressure
I put on, the more I fouled. I told [Coach] George [Karl] I'm done
with that."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Robinson led the NCAA in punt-return average, with
averages of 20.0 yards in 1939 and 21.0 in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bernie Lincicome in the Rocky Mountain News: "NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's threat to fine coaches if their players
make helmet-to-helmet hits will make as much difference as putting a
bib on a Rottweiler."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Are Grin Reapers</HD>
<DH>Finally showing some grit after 1-4 start, they earn a
120-117 win at Orlando and, for once, some postgame smiles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Clippers finally got it right Sunday. Oh, they were far from
flawless, but at the end, they ripped a game from the hands of the
Orlando Magic and managed relieved smiles afterward in their locker
room.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of yielding to Tracy McGrady's smooth drives and arcing
jump shots and Darrell Armstrong's hot shooting late, the Clippers
played a gritty style that had been notably absent during their first
five games.</LD>
<LD>   A 120-117 victory over the Magic before a crowd of 13,571 at TD
Waterhouse Centre was the sort of confidence builder the Clippers
needed. Resiliency wasn't exactly a hallmark of the Clippers' play in
the opening days and nights of the season, but it was Sunday against
Orlando.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers (2-4) overcame 32 points (on 12-for-21 shooting) from
McGrady, eight consecutive fourth-quarter points from Armstrong, a
sluggish start and a late Orlando run to steal a victory from the
Magic.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the Clippers reaped the benefits of Marko Jaric's dogged
defense against McGrady, who otherwise might have scored 40, and
Elton Brand's relentless pursuit of the basketball in the final
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   All five starters scored 16 or more points, led by Andre Miller's
season-high 29. Michael Olowokandi had 21 points, on 10-for-14
shooting, and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   One victory won't cure all that ails them, but it certainly lifted
the Clippers' spirits heading into the final game of a four-game trip
Tuesday at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the feel-good atmosphere began Saturday at the home of
Corey Maggette's family in Orlando. The Maggettes invited the team
for dinner to celebrate Corey's 23rd birthday a few days early.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good to have some home cooking and to have the whole team
and the coaching staff come over," said Maggette, who scored 19
points Sunday. "It was a good feeling to have everyone there
celebrating my birthday."</TE>
<TE>   Orlando (5-2) was the third stop on a tour of Eastern Conference
powers. The Clippers led the Philadelphia 76ers late only to lose in
overtime Wednesday, and led the New Jersey Nets in the fourth quarter
only to be routed in the closing minutes Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' prospects for a victory Sunday seemed dim after they
committed five turnovers in the first 6:10 and trailed, 19-9. The
sloppy play ended soon after that, however, and the Clippers rallied
into the lead in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   After Sean Rooks made two free throws with 10:32 remaining in the
game, the Clippers' lead grew to 94-84. The Magic rallied to tie the
score at 100-100, then surged into a 113-106 lead with 3:13 remaining
after Armstrong went on a personal 8-0 run.</TE>
<TE>   But Orlando would get only two free throws and a jump shot at the
buzzer from Grant Hill the rest of the way. Eric Piatkowski's
three-point basket got the Clippers started on a 14-4 roll to close
out the Magic.</TE>
<TE>   "I was talking to a couple of guys and they were saying [before
the game], 'Why can't we win any games?' " said Piatkowski, who made
eight of nine shots and scored 21 points. "We needed this game
mentally. It's good for us. It's going to give us a lot of
confidence. We hadn't played up to our potential."</TE>
<TE>   That changed in the final minutes Sunday. Ahead, 117-115, after
Keyon Dooling made two free throws, Brand blocked Pat Garrity's
three-point shot from the left-hand corner with 20.4 seconds left.
Brand chased down the loose ball, firing it to Jaric before it went
out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end, after Miller made one free throw and missed the
second, Brand beat Garrity to the rebound to enable the Clippers to
keep possession. The Magic again fouled Miller, who made both free
throws for a 120-115 lead with 14.7 seconds to play. Hill's
consolation bucket at the buzzer accounted for the final score.</TE>
<TE>   "We were up 10 points with nine minutes left," Brand said. "They
took the lead, but we took it back. About time we took one. It's
great for our confidence to come back and beat Orlando while they're
hot. We had it all going today."</TE>

<LD>   What: "O.J.: A Study in Black and White"</LD>
<TE>   Where: HBO, Tuesday, 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   When the advance media tape of this documentary arrived in the
mail, the reaction was: why?</TE>
<TE>   Why would HBO want to do a special on O.J. Simpson? What is left
to say? What is left to show? Every aspect of his story has been
played to the limit.</TE>
<TE>   But after taking a look, it became apparent this documentary is
not simply a rehash of what happened during Simpson's double-murder
trial or the jury's not-guilty verdict. Nor is it a typical biography
of a celebrity's life.</TE>
<TE>   It is a study of race relations in America, with Simpson being the
focal point.</TE>
<TE>   The show includes plenty about Simpson's background -- from his
struggles as a youngster in San Francisco through his stardom at USC
and in the NFL and his success after football.</TE>
<TE>   As for his days as a Trojan, coaches John McKay and Marv Goux were
interviewed before their deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a real hero in this city," McKay said. "I think even UCLA
liked him."</TE>
<TE>   Although Simpson also sat down for an interview, the producers
chose not to use it because they felt he had nothing substantial to
add.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't really matter, because the documentary is not primarily
about Simpson. It's an examination of a popular black athlete, one
readily accepted in white America, and how he polarized this country
with a spectacular fall from grace.</TE>
<TE>   At its core is the reaction to the not-guilty verdict -- elation
among so many blacks, anger and disgust among so many whites.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, as this documentary aptly points out, Simpson's
bizarre and tragic journey was a painful reminder that the greatest
challenge America faces is race.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There were several lessons to be learned over the weekend, but here
are three that jump to mind.</LD>
<LD>   1. Don't make Miami mad.</LD>
<LD>   2. Never, ever, ever douse your coach with Gatorade before the
final score has been logged and recorded with the NCAA.</LD>
<TE>   3. Bowl championship series officials were right -- and don't you
just hate that? -- when they said the national championship picture
would clear up if sportswriters only shut up for two seconds and
allowed the games to be played.</TE>
<TE>   OK, let's start with Miami. Speaking on behalf of the Nagging
Doubters Assn. of America, we formally apologize for our knee-jerk
demotion of the Hurricanes in the wake of less-than-compelling
victories.</TE>
<TE>   It's just that we think (here comes the cop-out) of Miami players
as performance artists and have come to expect such a level of
excellence that any drop-off is overly scrutinized.</TE>
<TE>   It took a 26-3 win over Tennessee on Saturday and the comments of
a sophomore tight end, Kellen Winslow, to provide the big-picture
context.</TE>
<TE>   "We are 31-0," Winslow noted of his school's record since
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, that. Until further notice, that ought to be good enough for
all of us.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Lexington, Ky., Louisiana State quarterback Marcus
Randall's 75-yard, last-second, multideflection scoring pass to
Devery Henderson takes its place alongside Doug Flutie to Gerard
Phelan and Kordell Stewart to Michael Westbrook in the annals of
famous "Hail Mary" flicks.</TE>
<TE>   Final score: LSU 33, Kentucky 30.</TE>
<TE>   You wonder how many times Kentucky can come out on the wrong end
of these time-capsule plays. Some Wildcat fans are just finishing up
therapy that began in 1992, the year Duke star Christian Laettner's
turnaround buzzer-beater knocked Kentucky out of the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   And now this?</TE>
<TE>   The best of the Saturday replay shots showed a delirious Kentucky
fan, ready to slobber God knows what out of his mouth, running on the
field as Randall let loose his final throw.</TE>
<TE>   The look on the fan's face when he understood that Randall's pass
had connected?</TE>
<TE>   Priceless.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Kentucky kids jumping the final gun and dumping
Gatorade on their coach, Guy Morriss?</TE>
<TE>   Well, that's a big no-no, as understood by anyone who owns a book
of quotes by Yogi Berra.</TE>
<TE>   As for this national title picture, well, it sort of cleared up
like Los Angeles after a rain.</TE>
<TE>   The BCS bosses told us weeks ago this could happen, but the idea
of having two clear-cut schools vying for the title wasn't nearly as
much fun as postulating the dark-side possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Our motives for predicting mayhem were well-founded. Only once
since the BCS was formed in 1998 has the national title game featured
two undefeated teams -- Florida State vs. Virginia Tech in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, here we stand, on Nov. 11, knowing Miami and Ohio State will
play in the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl as long as each team wins its
remaining games.</TE>
<TE>   Miami (9-0) has three games left, none of them sure things. The
Hurricanes take this week off before a Nov. 21 Thursday night home
game against Pittsburgh, then on Nov. 30 play at suddenly resurgent
Syracuse (ask Virginia Tech how that can go) before finishing up Dec.
7 at home against Virginia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State (11-0), which escaped a 10-6 scare at Purdue, plays at
Illinois next week before closing Nov. 23 in Columbus, Ohio, against
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   The national title hunt can only get interesting if Miami and/or
Ohio State falls between now and Dec. 8, when the final BCS rankings
are released.</TE>
<TE>   Looking to swoop in at a moment's one-loss notice are Oklahoma and
Texas, compatriots in the Big 12's South Division.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its loss at Texas A&amp;M on Saturday, Oklahoma is not out of
this race by a long shot. The Sooners fell from No. 2 to No. 6 in the
coaches' poll Sunday, but the Sooners' near-perfect mark of 2.04
means they possibly will fall only to No. 3 in today's BCS rankings,
still ahead of No. 4 Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma had an eight-point BCS lead on Texas entering weekend
play.</TE>
<TE>   Despite winning games over the weekend, Washington State and Notre
Dame may be the long-range losers.</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 (in the BCS) Washington State scored a top-notch victory
against No. 15 Oregon in Pullman, Wash., yet probably won't make much
hay out of it. The Cougars, whose only loss came to Ohio State, look
as if they're going to get boxed out in the standings by the top four
teams.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame's come-from-behind win against lowly Navy also figures
to be a drag on the Irish's BCS numbers. Notre Dame, No. 7 in last
week's BCS rankings, figures to drop at least one spot, surrendering
its position to BCS No. 8 Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   The Heisman Trophy race could come down to a battle of backfield
teammates, Miami senior quarterback Ken Dorsey and sophomore tailback
Willis McGahee. Hurricane center Brett Romberg did not hesitate when
asked which player he thought deserved the award. "I'd vote for Ken,"
Romberg said. "He'll do anything to win a football game. If someone
else wins, it'll be a shock." Romberg's opinion, it should be said,
is not impartial. He's Dorsey's roommate.</TE>
<TE>   Update on the Rose Bowl race. Barring major upheaval, it appears
Washington State will be headed to Pasadena. The Cougars need only
one win or one USC loss to clinch the Pacific 10 Conference title. A
spot in the Fiesta Bowl is not beyond the realm, but the Cougars
probably need three of the four teams ahead of them in the BCS
rankings to lose. On the Big Ten end, the Rose Bowl will lose Ohio
State to the Fiesta Bowl if the Buckeyes finish 13-0. In that case,
Iowa would make its first Rose Bowl appearance since 1990 as long as
the Hawkeyes beat Minnesota on Saturday to finish 11-1. While the
Rose Bowl is infatuated with the idea of Notre Dame making its first
trip to Pasadena since the 1925 game, it would not shun higher-ranked
Iowa to do it. And, get this, there's a chance Notre Dame at 11-1 can
get shut out of a BCS game. All it would take is the top four BCS
schools and Iowa winning out. In that case, No. 4 Texas or No. 3
Oklahoma would be guaranteed an at-large BCS berth and the Rose Bowl
would take Iowa. That would put the Irish in the Gator Bowl.</TE>

<HD>Miami Leaves No Doubt in Return to No. 1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miami is back at No. 1, and this time it's unanimous.</LD>
<LD>   The Hurricanes regained the top spot in the Associated Press media
poll on Sunday, a week after a 25-point victory over Rutgers saw them
drop to No. 2 behind Oklahoma.</LD>
<LD>   With the Sooners losing to Texas A&amp;M, 30-26, and Miami
overpowering Tennessee, 26-3, on Saturday, the Hurricanes (9-0)
received all 74 first-place votes and 1,850 points from the
sportswriters and broadcasters on the panel.</LD>
<TE>   Miami was No. 1 for a record 21 consecutive polls before being
replaced by Oklahoma. For the first time this season, though, the
Hurricanes made a clean sweep of the votes.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State (11-0), the only other unbeaten major college team,
moved up to No. 2 from No. 3 after its 10-6 win over Purdue. The
Buckeyes had 1,771 points.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State (9-1) made a big jump to No. 3 from No. 5 after a
32-21 win over Oregon. It is the highest ranking for the Cougars, who
closed in on their second Rose Bowl appearance in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma (8-1) and Texas (9-1) were tied at No. 4 and Iowa (10-1)
was No. 6. The four one-loss teams are separated by 32 points.</TE>
<TE>   Miami remained No. 1 in the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll, followed
by Ohio State, Texas, Washington State, Iowa and Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Miami and Ohio State should be first and second when the new bowl
championship series standings are released today. The Buckeyes were
second and the Hurricanes were third behind the Sooners last week.</TE>
<TE>   The top two teams in the final BCS standings Dec. 8 play for the
national title in the Fiesta Bowl at Tempe, Ariz., on Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Miami lost 27 first-place votes to Oklahoma in the AP
poll after rallying for a 42-17 win over Rutgers, which led by three
points in the fourth quarter. Coupled with the Sooners' 27-11 victory
over Colorado, AP voters gave the No. 1 spot to Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   There was no doubt about who should be No. 1 this week as Miami
was impressive in extending its winning streak to 31 games -- the
longest among major colleges in 31 years.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia (9-1) remained No. 7, followed by USC (7-2), Notre Dame
(9-1) and Alabama (8-2).</TE>
<TE>   Dropping out of the Top 25 were Bowling Green, Arizona State and
Iowa State. Bowling Green (8-1), No. 20 last week, lost, 26-17, to
Northern Illinois.</TE>

<LD>Here's a problem.</LD>
<LD>   The name.</LD>
<LD>   Officially these are "The Home Depot Championships presented by
Porsche."</LD>
<TE>   Is this a home-decorating contest or a Formula One race?</TE>
<TE>   No, it's a tennis tournament.</TE>
<TE>   And here's another problem.</TE>
<TE>   They've marched into Staples Center, 16 of the best female tennis
players in the world, one after the other, complaining about aches
and pains and exhaustion, some of them limping off the court, others
barely able to raise their racket arms.</TE>
<TE>   It is the season-ending tournament, supposedly a gathering of the
privileged, of the players who have worked hard to get here. Yet
we've heard lots of whining. "I must play less," Jelena Dokic said
before losing her final set of the season, 6-0, to Serena Williams.
"I'm tired," said Justine Henin, who went through tennis motions,
barely, before losing to Kim Clijsters, 6-2, 6-1. Henin is not so
tired that she won't be able to play some European exhibitions next
month.</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't work either: weekday matches at 12:30 in the
afternoon. Who goes? Kids are in school, grown-ups are at work.</TE>
<TE>   What we've seen too much of this week are empty seats and
desultory tennis.</TE>
<TE>   There have been crowds of fewer than 300 during the day and only a
couple of thousand at night. You could practically hear Henin and
Dokic breathe sighs of relief when they lost.</TE>
<TE>   And there was Sunday's first semifinal, where Venus Williams
limped onto the court, her left calf wrapped tight in a bandage. Five
games later, all won by Clijsters, and Williams called for the
trainer, then packed her bag, hugged Clijsters and walked off the
court.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart sank," said Kevin Wulff, chief executive officer of the
WTA. "But then, we had a great match."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there was a great match. Finally, a high-quality, three-set,
momentum-changing, nail-biting match between two players who
desperately wanted to win. By inches, by a missed line here, a net
cord -- or two, or three -- there, Serena Williams beat Jennifer
Capriati, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4, and most of the announced crowd of 8,164
forgot how Venus Williams had retired early.</TE>
<TE>   But one match doesn't make a tournament, and this is a tournament
that needs work.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, with the tournament in progress, you can walk up to
Staples Center and see not one banner, sign or poster, not one hint
there is a tennis tournament going on. Officials said about $400,000
was spent in advertising, but that is small change in this market.</TE>
<TE>   Weekday afternoon sessions Wednesday, Thursday and Friday drew
fewer than 500 each day, and when some players seem more eager to
start their vacations (and their lucrative exhibition seasons) than
play competitive tennis, it raises the question of whether this
tournament is worth having.</TE>
<TE>   It used to be.</TE>
<TE>   This culminating event, this supposed showcase for the WTA and its
top players, had spent 20 mostly successful years at Madison Square
Garden. Under various names, the longest-lived being the Virginia
Slims Championships, the tournament was something of a happening. The
final was best-of-five (until 1999), unusual for the women, and the
Garden was usually packed, at least at night and for the semifinals
and finals.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, with a tidy financial offer from German promoters and
a desire to offer European fans a chance to see the championships,
the tournament moved to Munich.</TE>
<TE>   It was a disaster. Crowds were nonexistent. There wasn't even a
championship match. Lindsay Davenport won her semifinal but hurt
herself on one of the last points. She had to withdraw from the
finals against Serena Williams without hitting a ball.</TE>
<TE>   The German promoters were eager to get out of their contract.
Staples Center came forward.</TE>
<TE>   And here we are.</TE>
<TE>   Billie Jean King, the perpetually optimistic saleswoman of women's
tennis, says no one should be too quick to make this tournament a
disaster or to remember fondly only the good old days in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "It took time to build the event," King said. "There were some
pretty empty days at Madison Square Garden too. What was important
was continuity. In my mind, it takes five years to build recognition
for a tournament."</TE>
<TE>   King is not happy when she hears that players complained of
exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course they're tired, I was tired at the end of the year,"
King said. "But after you say you're tired, you say what a privilege
it is to have earned your spot in the final 16. That's what they've
been killing themselves for."</TE>
<TE>   Despite some whispers that Madison Square Garden is angling to
regain the tournament, Wulff says it will return to Staples next
year. With changes, maybe, but it will return.</TE>
<TE>   Wulff said that the afternoon sessions may need to be scrapped.
The bad attendance early in the event "sets a certain negative tone,"
he said. King suggested it might be necessary to go to a round-robin
format, as the men have for their season-ending tournament.</TE>
<TE>   A bit of the player exhaustion may be alleviated when the last
tournament before the finals is in Philadelphia next year instead of
Europe, making the time adjustment more gradual. But an 11-month
season is too long with too much travel and too little recovery time.</TE>
<TE>   And, Wulff said, more must be done to promote the tour's most
prestigious event.</TE>
<TE>   First off, a different name might help. Mention tennis. Mention
the WTA. And tell the players, all of them, to act as if this
matters. Just showing up doesn't count. Wanting to win counts.
Actually trying to win counts even more.</TE>

<HD>Rams Win Fourth in Row</HD>
<DH>Bulger passes for 453 yards and leads late rally in 28-24
victory over Chargers.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>See if this sounds familiar: A bad start to the NFL season takes a
turn for the worse when the team's Pro Bowl quarterback goes down
with an injury. Suddenly, the offense is in the hands of an untested
reserve. Then, to the surprise of everyone, that untested kid
captures the imagination of a city and somehow revives the playoff
hopes of a franchise left for dead.</LD>
<LD>   Meet Marc Bulger, this season's Tom Brady.</LD>
<LD>   Six weeks ago, Bulger was the third-string quarterback for St.
Louis. Sunday, he threw for 453 yards and led the Rams to a
breathtaking 28-24 victory over San Diego with two touchdown passes
to Isaac Bruce in the final 3:06.</LD>
<TE>   Now, with Kurt Warner itching to return, Bulger faces the most
difficult assignment of his young career -- a drop-back to the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "If this was it, this was it," he said softly. "If I have another
week, I have another week. Our whole team is unselfish, and I'm not
going to be the guy that switches that."</TE>
<TE>   If there is a quarterback controversy, the Rams aren't letting on.
Last week, Coach Mike Martz confirmed Warner will be the starter when
he recovers fully from the broken pinkie on his throwing hand, and
dubbed skeptics who doubt Warner's effectiveness the "amnesia crowd."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams (4-5) would love to forget their 0-5 start. Warner
started the first four games, staggering out of the gate with one
touchdown and eight interceptions. Backup Jamie Martin took over for
him early in a Week 4 game against Dallas, when Warner suffered the
finger injury. Martin made one start, against San Francisco, before
being knocked out with a knee injury. That opened the door for
Bulger, a second-year pro who went undrafted out of West Virginia.
But Bulger looked as good as any first-round pick Sunday, his 453
yards passing the fourth-best total in Ram history behind Norm Van
Brocklin, Vince Ferragamo and Jim Everett. Before Sunday, the Rams
had lost their last 21 games in which they trailed after three
quarters. Bulger became the first St. Louis quarterback to reverse
that trend since Tony Banks in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   To the surprise of no one, Bulger got a massive bear hug from
Warner after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Kurt's been nothing but supportive the whole time," he said. "He
was supportive even when we were down by 10 points in the fourth
quarter. He doesn't change."</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, it looked as if Warner would be joined on the
sideline by Marshall Faulk, who briefly went to the locker room in
the first half because of an injury to his left foot. When he
returned, he suffered an injury to his right ankle that had him
hopping off the field in agony. He did not re-enter the game, but
looked to be fine in the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "Marshall should be all right," Martz said. "He assured me that
he'd be all right. When Marshall says that, he'll be OK."</TE>
<TE>   Less certain is the condition of the Chargers (6-3), who followed
an embarrassing home loss to the Jets with a heartbreaker. They
overcame a 7-0 deficit in the first quarter and took control by
forcing and recovering four fumbles -- two of which were returned for
touchdowns. Late in the fourth quarter, they had a 24-14 lead and St.
Louis pinned almost to its goal line. That's when Bulger took
control, driving the Rams 94 yards in six plays, and finishing the
job with a 34-yard touchdown pass to Bruce.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce, who was having a miserable 30th birthday after fumbling
twice, made a spectacular catch on the touchdown, one that belongs on
the All-VCR team. With cornerback Quentin Jammer in his face, he
tipped the ball with one hand, then snatched it out of the air as he
fell backward into the end zone. That cut the Charger lead to 24-21
with 3:06 to play.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd of 66,093 roared its approval and got even louder
moments later when Dre' Bly recovered an onside kick for the Rams.
That set up another Bulger scoring drive, ending with a seven-yard
touchdown pass to Bruce with 1:14 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by Ronney Jenkins' 52-yard kickoff return, and a
do-or-die completion by Drew Brees on fourth and 12, the Chargers
threatened to make the ending even wilder.</TE>
<TE>   But their bid for a fantastic finish fell short when cornerback
Dexter McCleon intercepted a pass in the end zone with 18 seconds on
the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Twice in the fourth quarter, the Chargers opted to punt when they
were within kicker Steve Christie's field-goal range.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point in time, my feeling was we were playing good
defense," Coach Marty Schottenheimer said. " ... I thought we were
better served punting the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Another chance went awry in the fourth quarter when receiver Tim
Dwight dropped a beautifully placed pass inside the Ram 10. At worst,
San Diego could have polished off that drive with a chip-shot field
goal.</TE>
<TE>   Time after time, the Chargers put themselves in a hole with
penalties. Left tackle Ed Ellis, unable to hear in the raucous dome,
was flagged for three false starts and drew a 15-yard facemask
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty loud," running back LaDainian Tomlinson said. "When
you can barely hear the play that the quarterback is calling, that's
loud."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Tomlinson, who had 120 yards in 24 carries, thought the
Chargers could slam the door.</TE>
<TE>   "We're supposed to play four quarters. We played about 3 1/2," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers left feeling they could have shown more, could have
proven more, could have finished the job.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Bulger might feel the same way.</TE>

<HD>Venus' Injury Puts Limp in Sisters' Plan</HD>
<DH>Anticipated all-Williams final is derailed when she
defaults to Clijsters, who advances to face Serena Williams, a
three-set winner over Capriati.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tight grasp of Serena Williams and Venus Williams on major
tournament finals slipped away Sunday afternoon, not because someone
finally figured out how to outplay one of the sisters, but because of
an injury.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe Kim Clijsters of Belgium would have defeated a fit Venus
Williams anyway. But the great potential of that semifinal matchup
will have to be left to the imagination. After losing five games in
13 minutes, Williams and her tightly wrapped left calf were out of
the season-ending Home Depot WTA Championships.</LD>
<LD>   And so, the day went from a limp to a scream.</LD>
<TE>   Shortly after Venus hobbled off the court, younger sister Serena
had to play an inspired semifinal to subdue a suddenly fleet and fit
Jennifer Capriati.</TE>
<TE>   Serena pumped her fist, glared at a baseline judge who called her
for foot faults and, yes, yelled after hitting a winner or one of her
14 aces before an announced crowd of 8,164.</TE>
<TE>   Serena's 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 win in 2 hours 11 minutes against No.
3-seeded Capriati was a much-needed crowd-pleasing match, cutting
into the malaise hanging over this event.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers had dodged one potential injury-related disaster when
Jelena Dokic was able to play against Serena on Saturday night
despite a sore ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Venus injury popped up out of nowhere less than 24 hours
later. Williams said she hurt her leg Thursday in the quarterfinal
against Monica Seles and it worsened Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times when you have an injury, with adrenaline and other
things, you start not to feel it in the match," Venus said. "I wasn't
really able to move or get up on my toes or change directions
effectively. There's also a certain amount of fear that the pain you
have already and more pain you can get if you go too far."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the dark cloud looming over Staples Center came from Munich,
Germany. There, in last year's WTA Championships semifinals, Lindsay
Davenport hurt her knee on the second-to-last point against
Clijsters, managed to win the match but was unable to play the final
against Serena.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's because of me. Every time someone plays me," said
Clijsters, joking.</TE>
<TE>   So it will be No. 5-seeded Clijsters against the defending
champion and No. 1 player in the world in tonight's final. Williams,
by winning, could become the first female tennis player to earn $4
million in one season. She is 5-0 against Clijsters; they met in the
Tokyo final in September.</TE>
<TE>   Except for this year's tour stop in Miami, where Serena beat Venus
in the semifinals, it is the first time since Wimbledon in 2001 that
the Williams sisters won't meet in the final of a tournament both
entered. They've met in four finals since that Wimbledon, in which
Capriati beat Serena in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Serena was aware Venus was hurting, but Venus said she did not
tell her father Richard about her injury because she guessed he would
have told her not to play. Serena agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "She was really injured, and I don't think she should have went
out," Serena said. "I was upset she went out."</TE>
<TE>   Venus looked as though she was ready to retire from the match a
couple of times before she called for the trainer on a changeover,
trailing, 0-5. She conferred with the trainer briefly, informed the
umpire that she was stopping and went over and hugged Clijsters.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati and Serena always seem to bring out the best in one
another even though Williams has now won the last six matches.
Capriati won the first set and had a break-point opportunity in the
ninth game of the second set. Had she converted it, she would have
served for the match.</TE>
<TE>   In the third set, the hardest-fought game was the third, which
featured seven deuces. Williams served three aces and fought off one
break point but then lost her serve, netting a forehand. Williams
looked irritated, swiping at the air with her racket.</TE>
<TE>   But she kept fighting, rallying from a 1-3 deficit. The craziest
game of the match was the eighth of the third set, with Capriati
serving. A forgiving tape kept yielding net cords for Williams. After
another one, Capriati, who eventually won the point, smacked the top
of the net hard with her racket.</TE>
<TE>   The decisive break came in the 10th game, at 30, Williams winning
it on her first match point as Capriati sent a backhand long.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intensity levels both were so high," said Williams, who has
won 18 straight matches. "We battle each time we play. We bring out
the best in each other. She had some amazing returns. Finally, my
serve was able to come through in the end."</TE>

<HD>Magical Statistic Reborn</HD>
<DH>Triple-double that Johnson made famous serves Bryant well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One assist. One bounce pass leading to a layup. Or one eye-blurring
bullet leading to a fallaway jumper. Or one no-look throw leading to
a slam dunk. That's all it would have taken Tuesday in Cleveland to
give Kobe Bryant a triple triple-double.</LD>
<LD>   With Shaquille O'Neal recuperating from off-season toe surgery,
Bryant is piling up big numbers and beginning to emulate a
multitalented Laker of another era in the most demanding of all of
basketball's statistical categories, the triple-double.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant had consecutive triple-doubles -- double figures in points,
rebounds and assists -- last week and missed a third consecutive by
that one assist.</LD>
<TE>   Harvey Pollack noticed right away. That figures.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to numbers, Pollack, who has been the guru of NBA
statistics more than half a century, notices everything. Who wins the
most jump balls, who sinks the most jumpers from 23 feet and who has
the most tattoos.</TE>
<TE>   So when this Laker rookie named Magic Johnson came along in 1979
and starting shooting and dishing and rebounding like nobody in the
game at that time, Pollack noticed.</TE>
<TE>   And when Pollack notices, he starts counting. And when he starts
counting, another statistical category is born.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, in the 1979-80 season, Pollack, then media relations
director for the Philadelphia 76ers, began to keep track of how many
times Johnson, the Lakers' unorthodox 6-foot-9 point guard, reached
double figures in points, rebounds and assists.</TE>
<TE>   "What's this?" Scott Ostler, then The Times' Laker beat writer,
says he asked Pollack.</TE>
<TE>   "Double-doubles," Pollack said.</TE>
<TE>   "No, this would be a triple-double."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, it became more than a name.</TE>
<TE>   The triple-double has come to represent the ultimate versatility
on the court, a player who has the touch and moves to be an effective
scorer, the muscle and determination to be a powerful rebounder and
the leadership, court sense and ballhandling ability to keep his
teammates involved.</TE>
<TE>   In baseball, a player who has maximum versatility is referred to
as a five-tool player, one who excels at hitting, hitting with power,
running, fielding and throwing.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson began piling up triple-doubles with startling regularity,
finishing his career with 138. He would have had even more had he not
been forced to gear his game around the Lakers' dominating center,
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.</TE>
<TE>   A similar situation has developed on the current Laker team with
Bryant. He has five triple-doubles in his career, three of them with
O'Neal sitting out.</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate the degree of difficulty of compiling a
triple-double, only one Laker has been able to span the period
between Johnson and Bryant. Center Vlade Divac had four
triple-doubles while wearing the purple and gold.</TE>
<TE>   James Worthy also had a triple-double for the Lakers while Johnson
was still playing, but his came in the postseason and was pivotal in
one of the most important games in team history. Worthy's 36 points,
16 rebounds and 10 assists led the Lakers to victory in the seventh
game of the 1988 NBA Finals against the Detroit Pistons, giving the
Lakers consecutive titles.</TE>
<TE>   But when it comes to triple-doubles, one man deserves a category
above Johnson, Bryant and the rest. Playing for the Cincinnati Royals
in the 1961-62 season, Oscar "Big O" Robertson averaged a
triple-double with 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson is atop the all-time list with 181 triple-doubles,
followed by Johnson, Wilt Chamberlain (78), Larry Bird (59) and the
current king, Jason Kidd of the New Jersey Nets, who had eight last
season to bring his total to 46. Michael Jordan has had 28
triple-doubles. If the 29-year-old Kidd were to play until his 40th
birthday, he would have to average better than 12 triple-doubles a
season to surpass Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd said he tries not to concern himself with numbers in the
middle of a game. But sometimes it's unavoidable because a teammate
will dribble by and remind Kidd he needs an assist or a rebound or
maybe two points for another triple.</TE>
<TE>   Four players in NBA history belong in an even more elite circle --
the quadruple double. Nate Thurmond, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson
and Alvin Robertson reached double figures in points, rebounds,
assists and blocked shots in a game.</TE>
<TE>   Points, rebounds and assists are the routine triple-doubles, but
Pollack, now 80 and still putting out a statistical yearbook, has
assembled what he calls "the unconventional" triple-doubles since the
1979-80 season.</TE>
<TE>   Those include triple-doubles in:</TE>
<TE>   * Points, rebounds and blocked shots. Olajuwon has done it the
most, nine, followed by Robinson and Dikembe Mutombo with seven
apiece.</TE>
<TE>   * Points, assists and steals. That has been accomplished twice, by
Fat Lever and Mookie Blaylock.</TE>
<TE>   * Points, rebounds and steals. A unique triple reached only by
Clyde Drexler.</TE>
<TE>   * Rebounds, assists and steals. This triple-double belongs
exclusively to Kendall Gill.</TE>
<TE>   * Points, assists and turnovers: Like it or not, Jerry Stackhouse
has this one all to himself.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA's most spectacular triple-double day was Jan. 31, 1989. On
that date, four players -- Johnson, Jordan, Ron Harper and Darrell
Walker -- each had a triple-double.</TE>
<TE>   That Pollack included such a momentous statistical event should
come as no surprise.</TE>
<TE>   This is a man who pays his grandson, 28-year-old Brian, to count
the number of tattooed players in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Pollack's latest count: There are 173 players with tattoos, led by
Allen Iverson with 19. Pollack may be slipping, though. He doesn't
have a category for most triple-doubles by a player with a tattoo.</TE>
<TE>   But if you suggest it to him ...</TE>

<CX>   NBA -- Alvin Robertson, one of four players to accomplish a
quadruple-double (double figures in four statistical categories in a

and steals, not points, rebounds, assists and blocks, as reported in

<KH>UCLA REWIND</KH>
<HD>Now Possibilities Open for Bruins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At ease, UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   Three months of constant football, from training camp in Thousand
Oaks to a rout in Tucson, and, finally, a day off today.</LD>
<LD>   Then another Saturday, an open date that precedes home games
against the top teams in the Pacific 10 Conference, second-place USC
and first-place Washington State.</LD>
<TE>   "We deserve the time off," Bruin tailback Tyler Ebell said. "We've
earned it. On the other hand, we're playing so good, I hate to stop,
even for a week."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the open date will be a plus or minus is one of several
glass half-full, glass half-empty propositions that can be discussed
this week. And there is plenty of time for talk.</TE>
<TE>   After all, idle time is the workshop of second-guessers,
worrywarts and Monday morning quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the Bruins can say it's a shame the layoff has to slow
momentum built by three consecutive victories, including a 37-7
trouncing of Arizona on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, they can say it's a relief it comes in time for injuries to
heal before the rivalry game against USC, which the Bruins haven't
won since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   For them, it's a shame their freshmen quarterbacks Drew Olson and
Matt Moore appear so even that a quarterback controversy seems to be
gathering like a distant storm despite Coach Bob Toledo's
protestations to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   For them, it's a relief Olson and Moore are pushing one another
while demonstrating tremendous poise and ability in spearheading wins
over Stanford, Washington and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   For them, it's a shame those victories were preceded by close
losses to Oregon and California that kept this pleasant little Bruin
season from becoming a bona fide bowl championship series-level
turnaround on par with Ohio State and Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   For them, it's a relief they are almost certain to gain a bowl
berth for the first time in two seasons and for only the second time
in the last four.</TE>
<TE>   And while it's a longshot, UCLA (7-3, 4-2) could find itself in
the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins must win their last two games against USC and
Washington State, and Washington State must lose to Washington on
Nov. 23. That could create a three-way tie between the Bruins, the
Cougars, and either USC or Arizona State. Based on the Pac-10's
tie-breaking procedure, UCLA would get the nod.</TE>
<TE>   If UCLA wins its last two games and Washington State defeats
Washington, the Bruins could go to the Holiday Bowl, not bad for a
team supposedly in rebuilding mode.</TE>
<TE>   But, such talk is premature.</TE>
<TE>   Notching back-to-back upsets of USC on Nov. 23 and Washington
State on Dec. 7 -- after another open date -- is not likely to
happen. Even though the Bruins are 6-0 under Toledo in home games
after an open date. Losses in one or both games most likely would
leave UCLA in the Sun Bowl, Insight Bowl, Las Vegas Bowl or Silicon
Valley Bowl, which take the third- through sixth-place Pac-10 teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins can finish no worse than tied for sixth and would be
left without a bowl game only in a combination of circumstances that
begins with Cal winning an NCAA appeal to have its bowl ban
overturned. Cal also must win another game, UCLA must lose twice, and
either Washington or Oregon State must win their last two games,
which would put them in a 4-4 standings tie with UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA defeated the Huskies and Beavers, but each bowl other than
the Rose Bowl can choose its Pac-10 participant when there is a tie.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<KH>USC REWIND</KH>
<HD>Scoring Average Rises Along With Ranking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As USC's scoring average continues to rise, so do the Trojans in the
Associated Press poll.</LD>
<LD>   USC moved up two spots to No. 8 on Sunday after a 49-17 Pacific 10
Conference victory over Stanford that kept them in the hunt for a bid
to the Rose Bowl or another bowl championship series game. It is the
Trojans' highest ranking since Sept. 30, 2000, when they held the
same spot before losing to Oregon State.</LD>
<LD>   USC has not been ranked as high this late in a season since the
1988 team was second after nine games.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't worry about the polls," junior flanker Keary Colbert
said. "We'll know where we stand at the end of the season."</TE>
<TE>   USC continued its climb by scoring 40 points or more for the
fourth time. No Trojan team had achieved that feat since the 1979
team did it five times en route to a 32.4 points-per-game average.</TE>
<TE>   This year's team is averaging 33 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We were hoping this was the way it was going to be," Coach Pete
Carroll said. "The pressure was on the offense to be productive with
the amount of people coming back."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's victory marked the third consecutive game USC scored 40
points or more, something no Trojan team has done in a season since
the 1972 national champions scored more than 50 points in victories
over Oregon State, Illinois and Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans can establish a school record by doing it again
Saturday against Arizona State at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils are coming off a 55-38 loss to California and have
surrendered 40 points or more four times.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't come out saying, 'Let's score 40 points,' " freshman
receiver Mike Williams said. "As long as everybody does their
assignments and we execute, we're going to move and we're going to
score."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Williams sprained his left ankle in the second half, but he caught
eight passes for 94 yards and a touchdown, and set the Pac-10 record
for receptions by a freshman.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who has 58 receptions, passed Washington's Reggie
Williams, who had 55 last season.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Williams has a touchdown catch in the last six games. He was
limited to fewer than 100 yards for the first time in five games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior receiver Kareem Kelly caught three passes for 69 yards and
showed he is nearly recovered from a right ankle sprain when he
caught a pass from quarterback Carson Palmer in the fourth quarter
and turned it into a 50-yard gain.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt good because every time my number was called I was able to
do things," said Kelly, who needs eight receptions to tie Johnnie
Morton's career record of 201.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Guard Lenny Vandermade injured his right biceps but is expected to
play against Arizona State.... The Trojans gained 135 yards rushing
against Stanford, but netted only 87 in part because of two sacks of
Palmer for 35 yards.... Tailback Justin Fargas had 43 yards in nine
carries and will probably start against Arizona State, said Carroll,
who was also impressed with Malaefou MacKenzie, the starting fullback
who had 41 yards in three carries as the tailback late in the
game.... USC's seven sacks eclipsed the previous high of five,
against Oregon State. "The offense is playing great and that allows
us to have fun," said safety Troy Polamalu, who made a team-high 13
tackles, including two for losses.</TE>

<HD>Beane Will Stay With A's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>Whether Billy Beane agreed to the parameters of a contract with the
Boston Red Sox Sunday only to have second thoughts while the Red Sox
were attempting to negotiate a compensation package satisfactory to
the Oakland Athletics is uncertain. This much is clear:</LD>
<LD>   The job as Boston's general manager was his if he wanted it, but
Beane withdrew his name from consideration Sunday night, choosing to
remain the architect of an Oakland team that has reached the playoffs
for three consecutive years despite one of the lower payrolls in
baseball and the consistent loss of key players.</LD>
<LD>   The A's said Beane will explain his reasons for not following
those players out of Oakland's small-market door in a news conference
this morning.</LD>
<TE>   However, an A's source said that Beane, with strong family
considerations on the West Coast, did not want to make a decision
based on money alone, that he has always regretted signing to play
baseball rather than accepting an opportunity to attend Stanford, and
he did not want to make another decision that he would regret.</TE>
<TE>   Added club spokesman Jim Young: "As corny as it sounds, Billy
simply had a gut check. He left an extremely attractive offer on the
table because he simply feels this is where he belongs, where his
heart is.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows how frustrating and challenging it can be, but he
thrives on that." Red Sox President Larry Lucchino wasn't happy but
he said, "Billy withdrew for personal, family and geographic reasons,
and we can respect that."</TE>
<TE>   For now, at least, Beane will honor a contract that runs though
2008, while the Red Sox return to the drawing board and a list of
candidates that includes interim General Manager Mike Port and
assistant Lee Thomas, both representing the Red Sox at the annual GM
meetings, which officially open here today.</TE>
<TE>   While Lucchino also has interviewed Jim Duquette, a senior
assistant general manager with the Mets; Ron Schueler, a former White
Sox general manager; Leland Maddox, the Cincinnati personnel
director; Mike Arbuckle, the Phillie assistant general manager, and
Mike Flanagan, an Oriole advisor and broadcaster, he had never lost
sight of Beane. However, repeated requests for permission to
interview the Beane were rejected by owner Steve Schott until Schott
relented Thursday night to Beane's series of requests to hear what
the Red Sox had to say.</TE>
<TE>   A whirlwind weekend, baseball sources insist, culminated Sunday in
Beane agreeing to a multiyear, multimillion-dollar contract with
Boston, only to experience what one source described as "something
akin to buyer's remorse" as he reflected on all the lives that would
be affected. Those lives included that of his wife, Tara, a Northern
Californian who was reluctant to move, a source said, and that of his
14-year-old daughter Casey, who lives with his first wife in Southern
California and who was the principal reason, Beane said at the time,
that he agreed to the West Coast security of a three-year extension
with the A's in March.</TE>

<HD>Players Profit From This Inside Information</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Coach Alvin Gentry recently called on his players to get the ball to
power forward Elton Brand and center Michael Olowokandi until the
opposition proved it could stop the Clipper game plan.</LD>
<LD>   The Orlando Magic caught on soon enough Sunday, but failed to stop
the Clippers' inside players entirely.</LD>
<LD>   Brand scored 16 points and took 12 rebounds, including seven on
the offensive end. Olowokandi had 21 points and 10 rebounds, eight
offensive.</LD>
<TE>   When the Magic attempted to stop the Clippers by double-teaming
either Brand or Olowokandi on the low block, they simply whipped
passes to open teammates on the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   Brand had four assists and Olowokandi three.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to keep dumping it inside, so that at the very least,
they would have to double-team the post," Gentry said. "Michael got
us off to a great start and Elton made some great plays at the end."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers moved the ball so well near the end of the game that
Gentry went with only Brand as a post-up player, keeping Olowokandi
on the bench for the final 5:30. Gentry believed -- correctly, as it
turned out -- that the quicker Brand was better suited to guard
Orlando's Pat Garrity.</TE>
<TE>   Brand's block of Garrity's three-point attempt with 20.4 seconds
to play was one of the game's pivotal defensive plays.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson sat out because of a bruised right knee. He
suffered the injury and a cut on his left eyelid during the Clippers'
loss Friday against the New Jersey Nets.... Lamar Odom said he's
targeting the first week in December for his return from a sprained
right ankle. He originally was expected back around Christmas.... The
Clippers shot a season-high 56.6% from the field and 83.3% from the
free-throw line.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>The Indianapolis Colts found their offense against the No. 2 defense
in the NFL.</LD>
<LD>   Peyton Manning threw for 319 yards and three touchdowns, and James
Mungro ran for 114 yards and two touchdowns, leading the Colts to a
35-13 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Colts (5-4) ended a losing streak at three. Philadelphia (6-3)
had won three in a row.</LD>
<TE>   Indianapolis, which struggled on offense in being outscored 64-10
in the first half of consecutive losses to Pittsburgh, Washington and
Tennessee, had 446 total yards against a defense that had given up
only 266.9 yards per game.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is ever perfect, but we played real well," Manning said.
"Everything worked. We called the right plays at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Manning threw touchdown passes of 57 and 43 yards to Marvin
Harrison and 27 yards to Reggie Wayne. Mungro, a rookie out of
Syracuse making the first NFL start because Edgerrin James and Ricky
Williams are sidelined with hamstring injuries, had touchdown runs of
six and 10 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dream come true," said Mungro, who grew up in East
Stroudsburg, Pa. -- 90 minutes from Veterans Stadium. "All my life
people have been telling me I'm too slow. I keep proving them wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Donovan McNabb threw for 281 yards and one touchdown and ran for
62 yards, but dropped a pass on a critical fourth and one in the
third quarter and also lost two fumbles.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles have scored only 69 points in the last four games after
getting 165 in their first five. "We did not come out and play with
emotion and that is my fault," Coach Andy Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   Mungro ran for 84 yards in the first quarter, including 65 on the
first series. The most yards rushing the Eagles had allowed to an
individual this season was 79 by the Giants' Tiki Barber</TE>

<KH>NEW YORK JETS 13, MIAMI 10</KH>
<HD>Jets Overcome Irate Dolphins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The New York Jets further scrambled the AFC East race Sunday night,
handing the Miami Dolphins their third consecutive loss, 13-10, on
John Hall's 28-yard field goal with 2:17 remaining.</LD>
<LD>   With their third victory in the last four games, the Jets moved
within a game of the other three division teams: Miami, New England
and Buffalo each are 5-4.</LD>
<LD>   The Dolphins were livid about the officiating. Several
controversial calls went the Jets' way, including an apparent
touchdown catch by Chris Chambers that was reversed by video replay,
and a fumble by Ricky Williams that Miami claimed never happened.</LD>
<TE>   "These refs just flat-out hooked them up," defensive end Jason
Taylor said. "We had to play a good Jets team and these guys too. It
was ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   "Stevie Wonder could see it was a catch."</TE>
<TE>   Early in the second quarter, Ray Lucas connected with Chambers in
the back right corner of the end zone on a nine-yard pass play.
Initially, it was called a touchdown, but Jet Coach Herman Edwards
challenged. "The guys in the booth said he caught it," Edwards said
of his assistant coaches, "but I thought he didn't. On my instincts,
I said I don't think he caught it. We were lucky on that."</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins certainly agree. Referee Larry Nemmers determined
that Chambers got both feet inbounds, but that he bobbled the ball as
he fell.</TE>
<TE>   As NFL director of officiating Mike Pereira explained: "When you
are going to the ground, even though two feet hit and an elbow hits,
when you hit the ground you have to maintain control of the ball.
It's the same at the 50-yard line as it is in the end zone. It's the
same inbounds as it is out of bounds. Even though the feet come down
first, if the ball comes loose, which it did here, if you don't
maintain control of the ball, then it's an incomplete pass."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was tight until the end, when the Jets drove 84 yards to
set up Hall's winning field goal. The key play was Laveranues Coles'
42-yard reception on a fly pattern from the Jet 10.</TE>

<HD>A Perfect Reaction From Force</HD>
<DH>Quicker off the line, he beats his protege, Pedregon, in
semifinal at NHRA Finals at Pomona and comes away with his 12th
funny-car title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shav Glick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Any lingering thoughts that teammates John Force, the boss, and Tony
Pedregon, the protege, might manipulate the outcome of their National
Hot Rod Assn. funny-car championship battle were dispelled Sunday in
a dramatic side-by-side semifinal at Pomona Raceway.</LD>
<LD>   It came down to this: If Force won, it would give him a 10th
consecutive championship and 12th overall. If Pedregon won, it would
be his first, but the 12th for Force's Yorba Linda-based team.</LD>
<LD>   Force won, but barely. The 53-year-old veteran got the jump on
Pedregon off the line with a reaction time of 0.447 of a second to
0.471, and maintained it through the quarter-mile. Pedregon's time to
the finish line was faster, 4.935 seconds to 4.954, but because of
the reaction time Force's Castrol Mustang got there first.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the 45,000 fans were on their feet as Force crossed the
final stripe less than a foot in front. The official margin was 0.005
of a second.</TE>
<TE>   In the anticlimactic final in the 38th Auto Club NHRA Finals,
Force defeated Tommy Johnson Jr., one of Don Prudhomme's drivers, in
another tight finish. Again, it was Force's remarkable reaction time
that enabled him to win his 106th event.</TE>
<TE>   It was the eighth win of the season for Force, the sixth time he
has won as many as eight in one year. No other funny-car driver has
won eight in a season.</TE>
<TE>   Force was his ebullient self in accepting the champion's trophy.
"I am going to go home and call all the sponsors and tell them this
old man is still alive and don't throw him away yet," he said. "I
want to thank God for the sunshine, and I want to thank the NHRA
[President] Tom Compton, the racers, fans and the media -- they make
it happen."</TE>
<TE>   The win was worth $400,000 for the Powerade title and $40,000 for
the event.</TE>
<TE>   Culminating a comeback from 2001 when he did not race for lack of
a sponsor, Cory McClenathan took the $40,000 top-fuel prize by
defeating surprise finalist Yuichi Oyama of Japan. McClenathan, who
is looking for a sponsor for 2003, also won with superior reaction
off the line even though Oyama ran 4.739 to 4.756.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an awesome win," the Anaheim veteran said. "It looked
for a while that I wasn't going to win this year, but this made the
effort all worthwhile."</TE>
<TE>   Few events in recent history have seen as many first-round
surprises.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the three NHRA champions crowned before coming to Pomona --
Larry Dixon in top fuel and Angelle Savoie in pro-stock bike -- were
gone before many of the fans were in their seats.</TE>
<TE>   Top fuel, the first class to test the rain-washed racing strip,
lost, in addition to Dixon, the retiring Kenny Bernstein and No. 1
qualifier Darrell Russell.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein's exit was the most surprising. It came in the 970th
round of his illustrious career, at the hands of rookie Oyama,
driving an eight-year-old dragster he purchased from Robert Reehl of
Whittier. It was only the 11th time Oyama had made a competitive run.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly not the way you want to go out," said Bernstein,
winner of four funny-car and two top-fuel titles. "You want to win at
least a couple of rounds, but that's the nature of this business. It
happens."</TE>
<TE>   Because it had rained for two days and the top-fuel dragsters can
apply as much as 1,800 pounds of downforce through their
6,000-horsepower engines, it was a guessing contest how to set up the
skittish machines for their 300-plus mph runs.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was in the same boat, we were no different from anyone
else," said Bernstein in defusing an obvious excuse. "We'd love to
have had three or four [qualifying] runs, but it was the same for
everybody. Nobody got an advantage. It's just one of those deals."</TE>
<TE>   Oyama, 39, is a six-time top-alcohol funny-car champion in Japan.
After attending Frank Hawley's drag racing school in Gainesville,
Fla., he competed on the International Hot Rod Assn. circuit in 1998
and made his NHRA debut this year at the Pomona Winternationals,
where he lost in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, when racing in Japan, Oyama drives a dragster formerly
driven by Bernstein.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon, who clinched his first top-fuel title two weeks ago in Las
Vegas, saw his tires go up in smoke off the starting line in losing
to No. 15 qualifier Scott Weis, driving the Race Girl team dragster.
Russell, after qualifying No. 1 Thursday, was no match for
nonqualifier Andrew Cowin as he limped down the quarter-mile at 92
mph. Cowin, from Australia, was driving the pinstriped Yankee car for
Darrell Gwynn. He failed to qualify Thursday but was seeded into the
final eliminations because he was in the top 10 in the year's
standings.</TE>
<TE>   Savoie, after taking her third consecutive pro-bike championship
at Las Vegas, was faster and quicker than Scott Lewis in a battle of
Suzukis, but Lewis beat her off the starting line with a reaction
time of 0.419 of a second to 0.620 for the champion. Savoie ran 7.191
seconds at 185.41 mph to 7.337 and 182.28 for the quicker starting
winner.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Hines won the bike final, defeating Geno Scali, the only
rider among the 16 finalists not on a Suzuki. He was riding a
Kawasaki.</TE>
<TE>   In pro stock, Kurt Johnson avenged his father Warren's defeat by
beating Gene Wilson in the finals. Wilson, in a Dodge Neon, had
sidelined No. 1 qualifier Warren Johnson on the semifinal, but in the
final, Kurt's Chevrolet Cavalier won, 6.801 to 6.843.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed this after 47 races without a win and it's nice to be
able to take some money back home," said Johnson, who collected
$25,000 to take home to Lawrenceville, Ga.</TE>

<HD>Babcock Impresses Murray</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Not too many people knew much about Mike Babcock when he was hired as
coach of the Mighty Ducks last spring, but General Manager Bryan
Murray did and he's pleased with the job Babcock has done.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew that it would take some time for the players to understand
the things that he wants done and he's done a great job of
communicating with them," Murray said about Babcock, who has led the
Ducks to a 6-6-3-0 record after Sunday's 1-0 victory over Minnesota.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone knows about his enthusiasm, but his preparation and his
ability to study for individual games has been really top-notch."</LD>
<TE>   Before being hired by Murray, Babcock spent the previous two
seasons coaching the Ducks' American Hockey League affiliate, the
Cincinnati Mighty Ducks, guiding the team to the Calder Cup playoffs
each season. This is Babcock's first season as an NHL coach.</TE>
<TE>   "[Babcock's] starting to trust the younger players more than he
did," Murray said. "It was more of a situation of him adapting to new
people more than a new league and he's learning that sometimes you
have to let the players play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winger Mike Leclerc did not score for the Ducks against Minnesota,
but he certainly was one of the best players on the ice. Leclerc was
a force on both ends from beginning to end.</TE>
<TE>   "He got the puck out better than he has, and I've been on him a
lot about that lately," Babcock said of Leclerc, who finished with
eight shots on goal. "He was the big man on the wall getting the puck
out."</TE>

<HD>Mighty Ducks Join the Fortune .500</HD>
<DH>Chistov's goal gives Anaheim a 1-0 victory over the
Minnesota Wild and helps the team even its win-loss record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reaching .500 in November normally is not something to cheer about,
but when you're the Mighty Ducks, it's definitely a move in the right
direction.</LD>
<LD>   That's why Sunday's 1-0 victory over Minnesota felt so good for
the Ducks, who improved to 6-6-3-0 behind a first-period goal from
rookie Stanislav Chistov and goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere's
first shutout this season.</LD>
<LD>   "We look at it as kind of a stepping point," Duck forward Matt
Cullen said of the team, which is 4-1-1 in its last six games. "We've
reached .500 and now we don't want to go back below it because it's a
point that is tough to get back to."</LD>
<TE>   In front of an announced 14,070 at the Arrowhead Pond, Giguere put
on a show, making one timely save after another to finish with 26 and
frustrate the road-weary Wild, which played Saturday night at San
Jose.</TE>
<TE>   It was the type of effort Giguere didn't give the Ducks at the
start of the season, when he opened with a 1-5-2 record and a .890
save percentage.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't happy with the way the season started for myself," said
Giguere, who has stopped 127 of 134 shots in his last four starts. "I
thought that I had to bring the level of my conditioning up a little
bit and I'm battling a little harder. When you do that, you make
yourself luckier and a little better."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota, which in only its third season has the most points in
the league with 22, had reason to be a little tired. The Wild, which
completed its victory over the Sharks less than 20 hours before the
start of Sunday's game, was playing the final game of a four-game
West Coast trip that began Monday with a 5-2 victory over the Kings
at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who have won three in a row, jumped to an early lead
after Chistov, selected fifth overall in the 2001 draft, scored on
the type of play that always seems to come easy for goal scorers.</TE>
<TE>   Petr Sykora got the play started when he fired a shot from deep in
the right corner that goaltender Manny Fernandez slapped with his
stick. The puck rolled into the slot where Chistov stood alone. Then,
just as Chistov wound up to shoot, Fernandez was knocked to the ice
by Duck forward Andy McDonald, leaving the net open for a 1-0 Duck
lead 6:35 into the first period.</TE>
<TE>   "I turned and saw the puck come to me and then I shoot," Chistov
said of his fourth score this season. "It was an easy goal."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Giguere was on top of his game. With nearly seven
minutes remaining in the second period, he made several impressive
saves.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere, who had given up only seven goals in his previous three
starts, made consecutive stops on former Duck Richard Park and Wild
defenseman Nick Schultz.</TE>
<TE>   A minute later, Giguere stopped Minnesota's leading scorer, Marion
Gaborik, who had a solid scoring chance from outside the left post.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks made things difficult for themselves when they gave the
Wild two power-play opportunities in the first four minutes of the
third period, on a slashing penalty on Paul Kariya and a holding
penalty on Ruslan Salei.</TE>
<TE>   But again, Giguere and the Duck defense were up to the task.
Giguere had to make only two stops, the most dangerous against right
wing Sergei Zholtak from the slot.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the Ducks dominated as they kept pressure on
Fernandez, who finished with 36 saves.</TE>
<TE>   "In the third period we went after it instead of backing off,
which is really important," Duck Coach Mike Babcock said. "This was a
good test for us."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks will hit the road for a five-game trip that will begin
at New Jersey on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "More than momentum for the road trip, [this victory means]
momentum for our team," Babcock said. "We're taking steps, not big
steps, but they are steps and getting better. We're finding out more
about our team."</TE>

<KH>N.Y. GIANTS 27, MINNESOTA 20</KH>
<HD>Drive to Win Is Shown Late</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>A woeful kicking game, plus a quarterback change by the Minnesota
Vikings, nearly cost the New York Giants, but they wore out one of
the league's worst defenses.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants amassed 460 total yards and took a late lead on Tiki
Barber's touchdown run Sunday in a 27-20 victory that dropped the
Vikings to 2-7 for the first time since 1984.</LD>
<LD>   "This whole game was a study in perseverance for us," Barber said.
"In the NFL, when the momentum shifts, it's real tough to get it
back. Last drive, we had to snatch the momentum away."</LD>
<TE>   Kerry Collins completed 25 of 35 passes for 300 yards and two
touchdowns, and Barber rushed 24 times for 127 yards as New York
(5-4) moved within a game of NFC East-leading Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota ran out of patience with struggling quarterback Daunte
Culpepper, and Todd Bouman nearly rallied the Vikings to a win that
would have been due largely to two extra points and two mid-range
field goals botched by the Giants. "I'm proud of the way our guys
came back," said Giants' Coach Jim Fassel. "It shouldn't have been
that close. We left eight points off the board."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Bennett rushed for a career-high 167 yards, his third
consecutive 100-yard game. He scored on a 78-yard burst through the
line that gave Minnesota its first lead, 20-19, with 8:36 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants, aided by a third-down pass interference call on Corey
Chavous, drove 80 yards in 10 plays to retake the lead on an
eight-yard scoring run by Barber. Marcellus Rivers caught a deflected
two-point conversion pass to make it 27-20 with 2:43 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings had to punt after rookie tackle Bryant McKinnie,
making his NFL debut after ending a holdout last week, let Kenny
Holmes by him to sack Bouman and force a fumble that lost 20 yards on
third down.</TE>
<TE>   Barber ran out the clock with 40 yards on the final possession.
"It's on us," Vikings' defensive tackle Chris Hovan said. "The
defense has got to stop 'em, and we didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Culpepper didn't throw an interception but was only nine for 20
for 91 yards. After another three-and-out series in the third
quarter, Coach Mike Tice sent in Bouman as the crowd cheered.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>When Alex Trebek bought a farm in Central California six years ago,
racing horses wasn't the objective. But Sunday, there was the host of
"Jeopardy" at Hollywood Park, leaving the winner's circle and talking
about sending a horse to Japan for a $2-million race.</LD>
<LD>   Trebek's Reba's Gold won the $72,850 Steinlen Stakes, and he and
Rollin Baugh, the bloodstock agent who had picked out the horse and
bought him for $125,000 three years ago, are now planning to run in
the Japan Cup Dirt Stakes on Nov. 23.</LD>
<LD>   When Trebek bought Cardiff Stud Farm in 1996, he leased it back to
the Fred Sahadi family, which had owned the property. "But then when
their lease ran out, they didn't want to renew," Trebek said. "So
that's what catapulted me into the horse racing business."</LD>
<TE>   Reba's Gold pushed his earnings past the $500,000 mark by coming
back in the stretch to beat Mercenary by a head.</TE>
<TE>   "When [Mercenary] came at me, he came really quick," jockey David
Flores said of Reba's Gold. "I was kind of surprised....I hit him
once left-handed and I could feel that he was [coming] back."</TE>
<TE>   Because of recent heavy rain, the Steinlen was moved from the
grass to the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The head of mutuels at the New York Racing Assn., which operates
Aqueduct, Belmont Park and Saratoga, has indicated that those tracks
might follow Churchill Downs' lead and shut off betting before the
start of the gate-loading process for each race.</TE>
<TE>   "We are probably going to have to follow suit," Vince Hogan told
the New York Post. "It will eliminate those late [betting] flashes
that confuse the public. We're all thinking of doing it, although it
will hurt the big bettors, who like to see the latest flash before
making their bets."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning this week, Churchill Downs' tracks, which include
Hollywood Park, will introduce early shutdowns of betting, perhaps a
minute to a minute and a half before each race starts. The new policy
begins Thursday at Hollywood.</TE>

<LD>With less than six minutes to play Friday, it looked as if Bellflower
St. John Bosco was headed toward a homecoming to forget.</LD>
<LD>   The Braves trailed Serra League rival Anaheim Servite by 11 points
on a night when a downpour had already dampened spirits.</LD>
<LD>   St. John Bosco fans started filing toward the exits as soon as the
Braves turned the ball over to Servite on a fumble with 5:37 left.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone was leaving," Coach Kiki Mendoza said. "Even some of my
coaches were ready to leave."</TE>
<TE>   Those who stayed were rewarded with a fantastic finish, as the
Braves capitalized on two Servite fumbles for a 24-20 victory. St.
John Bosco moved into sole possession of first place in the league 24
hours later, when Santa Margarita upset Santa Ana Mater Dei, 19-0.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves (7-2, 4-0 in league) play what Mendoza is calling their
most important game in 16 years when they take on Mater Dei (7-2,
3-1) on Thursday at Santa Ana Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   A victory would give the Braves their first league title since
1986 and make them the league's top entrant in the Southern Section
Division I playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody really gave us a chance," said Mendoza, who before this
year had never won more than one game in league play during five
seasons as coach. "And that's fine by us."</TE>
<TE>   St. John Bosco's last league title came in the Del Rey League,
which then comprised Los Angeles Loyola, Encino Crespi, Mission Hills
Alemany, Sherman Oaks Notre Dame and La Canada St. Francis.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves went on to lose to Crespi in the section championship
game that season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula's continued domination of Beverly
Hills kept alive its hopes of a Division III playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers' 34-14 victory over the Normans means Peninsula's
game Friday at Inglewood (5-4, 1-2) will decide third place and the
final guaranteed playoff berth from the Bay League.</TE>
<TE>   Peninsula (5-4, 1-2) is 7-0 against Beverly Hills since opening in
1991, following the mergers of Palos Verdes, Miraleste and Rolling
Hills highs.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the loss, Beverly Hills (6-3, 2-1) qualified for the
playoffs along with Manhattan Beach Mira Costa (9-0, 3-0) after the
Mustangs' 42-22 victory over Lawndale Leuzinger (3-6, 1-3).</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills, which has not won a Bay League championship since
1940, will earn a share of the title with Mira Costa if it defeats
the Mustangs on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Normans face an uphill climb, considering Mira Costa has won
17 consecutive league games in the last three seasons, including a
42-0 victory over Peninsula on Oct. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura St. Bonaventure and Orange Lutheran, private schools that
competed in Division XI a year ago, are enjoying life in
predominantly public leagues. Each is the only private school in its
respective division.</TE>
<TE>   St. Bonaventure (8-1, 4-0) would wrap up the Channel League title
in Division IV with a victory over Ventura Buena (7-2, 4-0) on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Recent history favors the Seraphs, who are 48-1 in the last four
years.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Lutheran (7-2, 4-0) is the toast of Division VI and would
win the Empire League with a victory over Anaheim Loara (0-9, 0-4) on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Lancers are 15-0-2 in their last 17 games against public
schools, with their only losses in that span coming to Servite
(twice), St. Bonaventure (twice) and Mater Dei (once).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Arcadia was sending a message to the rest of the Pacific
League, Pasadena, at least, received it.</TE>
<TE>   After trailing, 6-0, in the first quarter, the Apaches scored 47
consecutive points for a 47-6 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a statement," Coach Jon Dimalante said. "It was a great
game for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   The Apaches (9-0, 4-0), who last season finished second in league,
clinched at least a share of the title.</TE>
<TE>   Arcadia can win the title outright with a victory over defending
champion Crescenta Valley (5-4, 2-2) on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach suffered two devastating losses during its 32-7
defeat at the hands of Sunset League rival Huntington Beach Edison.</TE>
<TE>   The Oilers' fading playoff hopes vanished, but worse, running back
Patrick Harrigan was lost for the season because of a knee injury in
the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The senior, who rushed for 95 yards, finished the season with
1,921 yards and 18 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Avila rushed for 188 yards and three touchdowns for Edison
(4-5, 2-2), which will need to defeat Los Alamitos in its
regular-season finale to qualify for a possible playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterbacks Matt Engle of El Segundo and Richard Irvin of
Pasadena Muir have put up some gaudy numbers over their careers, but
nothing like those posted by Charlotte (N.C.) Independence's Chris
Leak.</TE>
<TE>   Leak set a national high school record for career touchdown passes
Friday when he threw his fifth of the game during Independence's
49-13 victory over Charlotte Vance.</TE>
<TE>   Leak, the younger brother of Tennessee reserve quarterback C.J.
Leak, has 171 touchdown passes, surpassing the mark of 170 set by
Rhett Lashlee of Shiloh (Ark.) Christian from 1999-2001.</TE>

<LD>A return to Southern California could be what Labamta Babe needs to
get back on track.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-year-old son of Skywalker will make his first Southern
California start since he won the Santa Catalina Stakes at Santa
Anita on Jan. 19 in today's seventh race at Hollywood Park.</LD>

the ill-fated Siphonic in the Santa Catalina, but had to skip the
Triple Crown races because of injury.</LD>
<TE>   A private purchase by his current connections after he had three
races in Kentucky, Labamta Babe resurfaced in the Kings Bishop at
Saratoga Aug. 24. Over a sloppy track, the dark bay colt finished
last, beaten by almost 30 lengths. He made his turf debut Oct. 3 at
Belmont Park and had a troubled trip, finishing fifth as the 17-10
favorite.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<KH>JACKSONVILLE 26, WASHINGTON 7</KH>
<HD>Spurrier's Return No Fun</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The visor finally went flying to the ground, along with everything
else Steve Spurrier could grab, early in the fourth quarter when yet
another Washington Redskins' play fizzled.</LD>
<LD>   Spurrier is no stranger to frustration in his first season as an
NFL coach. He's just not used to it at Alltel Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Returning to the stadium where he routinely won as coach of the
Florida Gators with his Fun 'n Gun offense, Spurrier endured a harsh
homecoming Sunday as the Redskins went their final 11 drives without
a point in a 26-7 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.</LD>
<TE>   "Welcome Back, Spurrier," said a banner in packed (66,665) stadium
that is the site of Florida's annual game with Georgia. "This has
been a good stadium for most of the teams I've coached," Spurrier
said. "You're only as good as your last game. I'm not very good right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier was 9-1 against Georgia. He also won a Gator Bowl at
Alltel, and had two victories in the stadium as coach of the USFL's
Tampa Bay Bandits.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, it looked like the Spurrier of old, the coach whose
emotions are always on display.</TE>
<TE>   The visor came off for the first time with 10:30 left in the first
half when Bryan Barker shanked a punt. When a failed screen pass
bounced to him, Spurrier kicked it back onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   He finally lost it in the fourth quarter, when Shane Matthews
threw incomplete on third and five, tossing everything to the ground
-- visor, headsets, play chart.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't work out for the Redskins tonight," Spurrier said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington and Jacksonville both have 4-5 records.</TE>

<HD>Palffy's Scoring Touch Is Missing in Action</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Late Saturday night in the Bell Centre, still smarting from a high
stick to the mouth he'd taken during a 3-1 loss to the Montreal
Canadiens, Ziggy Palffy said that his badly swollen lower lip wasn't
all that needed healing.</LD>
<LD>   The Slovak winger, who scored a club-high 32 goals in 63 games
last season, has scored one in nine this season, none since the
second period of a 4-1 opening-night victory over the Phoenix Coyotes
on Oct. 9. In the six games since Jason Allison was sidelined because
of a knee injury, he has two points.</LD>
<LD>   "It is frustrating for me," he said after the Kings had lost for
the third time in four games. "I just don't know what to say. It's
hard, you know. Everybody is trying, giving everything you can.
Sometimes nothing is going your way.</LD>
<TE>   "But I have to step up myself. I'm not playing well. I'm not
playing my game. I have to help this team a little more."</TE>
<TE>   Palffy sat out six games because of a strained left groin, an
injury that hampered his conditioning and still is not completely
healed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little bit tight," he said, "but it's no excuse. If you're
not playing, it's hard to come back. But I have to help this team to
win games. That's what is my job."</TE>
<TE>   Palffy shouldn't get too discouraged, Coach Andy Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "Scorers are guys that get reinforcement from scoring, and that
hasn't been there for him as much as he would have liked or we would
have liked," Murray said, "but we thought he played better [Saturday]
night. He had some opportunities. I see signs in his game that it's
coming around for him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three times this season the Kings have played games on consecutive
nights, a situation they'll face 11 more times, the next Nov. 29-30.
They're 0-3 in the second-night games and have been outscored, 12-4.</TE>

<HD>His Foot Still Failing, Shaq Is Likely to Sit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers finished practice midafternoon Sunday, and Shaquille
O'Neal had set them free by shouting, "1-2-3," to which the rest of
them responded, "Lakes," and turned away, when Coach Phil Jackson
called them back.</LD>
<LD>   They ducked their heads and Jackson recited a short prayer, and so
concluded a day of spiritual and muscular healing for the three-time
defending NBA champions, standing at 2-5 and, for the moment,
resembling it.</LD>
<LD>   It is beginning to look as though the Lakers -- Jackson and O'Neal
in particular -- will be surprised if O'Neal plays Tuesday night
against the Atlanta Hawks. O'Neal didn't say much on his way off the
floor, and a hustling Kobe Bryant did the presidential thing: Asked
how O'Neal looked during 45 minutes or so of an end-to-end practice,
Bryant grinned, held one thumb up, and disappeared into the trainer's
room.</LD>
<TE>   Though Jackson told reporters to ask him again today about O'Neal
and the chance he would play Tuesday, he admitted, "Right now, I
don't think that he's in a position where he feels comfortable enough
to play."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had surgery Sept. 11, and while he has taken part in most
recent practices -- he rested briefly a couple of times Sunday
because of conditioning, Jackson said -- O'Neal does not appear to be
preparing to play against the Hawks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's still got some questions about being over that
sesamoiditis," Jackson said of the condition beneath O'Neal's toe, in
the area where the surgeon removed bone spurs. "I think he's dealing
with what he can do and can't do, and feeling comfortable on the
floor. He's still not, I would say, fluid in running and moving in
basketball terms."</TE>
<TE>   So the news remained bleak for the Lakers. They will have to live
with their three-game losing streak, and the way Friday's game in
Washington ended, at least until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson preached to them for 15 minutes before Sunday's practice
on the subject of coping with adversity, though apparently it didn't
brighten Bryant's day much. Rick Fox described his fellow captain as
being something of a "sourpuss" through practice, and Jackson said,
"He came in a dark mood. He was not a happy camper. He'll be all
right, though."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant had been very disappointed at the end of the trip, and
particularly with what he viewed as Devean George's defensive lapse
against Jerry Stackhouse, whose uncontested dunk won it for the
Wizards at the buzzer. Neither George, who has two sprained ankles,
nor Robert Horry, who has a sore ankle and foot and might have helped
George on the play, practiced much Sunday. Bryant, who also is
recovering from a sprained ankle and has done a lot of the heavy
lifting for the last two weeks, skipped most drills as well.</TE>
<TE>   In the spirit of the day, Jackson and Fox tried to spread the
responsibility for those 2.9 seconds, and then forget them.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's to blame," Jackson said. "That's what I think."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fox: "We're a brotherhood.... We've all done things at
crucial times we'd like to forget."</TE>

<HD>Stewart Gets Closer to Title</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AVONDALE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Matt Kenseth turned a two-tire stop into his fifth victory of the
season while Tony Stewart remained in control of the NASCAR Winston
Cup Series championship points race.</LD>
<LD>   Kenseth got out of the pits first after the leaders pitted on lap
261 of the 312-lap Checker Auto Parts 500, and stayed out front the
rest of the way Sunday at Phoenix International Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart and Mark Martin ran in the top 10 through most of the
500-kilometer race. Martin's fourth-place finish, combined with
Stewart's eighth place, reduced the margin from 112 to 89 points with
only next Sunday's race in Homestead, Fla., remaining.</LD>
<TE>   No matter what Martin does next week, Stewart will win the title
if he doesn't lead a lap and finishes 22nd or better; leads one lap
and finishes 24th or better; or leads the most laps and finishes 25th
or better.</TE>
<TE>   Kenseth, who had been running fifth early in the race, dropped to
11th after running out of gas during a series of green-flag pit stops
and having to coast to pit road for his first stop on lap 122.</TE>
<TE>   He kept his Roush Racing Ford near the front, though, and was
third when the fourth and final caution flag of the race came out on
lap 258 after Jason Leffler hit Christian Fittipaldi, a CART star
making his first Winston Cup start, and sent him into the wall.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders pitted on lap 250 with Kenseth's teammate Kurt Busch
and Jeff Gordon ahead of Kenseth's No. 17 Taurus. While Kenseth and
Rusty Wallace each put on only two fresh tires, the others changed
four and Kenseth and Wallace returned to the track 1-2.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it stayed to the end, with Kenseth beating
Wallace's No. 2 Ford to the finish line by 1.344 seconds -- about
half a straightaway on the one-mile oval.</TE>

<LD>Chris Webber scored 27 points Sunday night and the Sacramento Kings
remained unbeaten at home this season, defeating the Atlanta Hawks,
105-97.</LD>
<LD>   Ahead by four points heading into the final period, Sacramento
went on a 16-5 run. Bobby Jackson ended the run with a three-point
basket, giving the Kings a 91-77 lead midway through the quarter.</LD>
<LD>   In all, Jackson scored 23 points and had five steals for
Sacramento, which is 4-0 at Arco Arena.</LD>
<TE>   Despite a scoreless first half, Doug Christie finished with 19
points, eight rebounds and seven assists for the Kings. Peja
Stojakovic made three three-point baskets and had 17 points and Vlade
Divac added nine points, 10 rebounds and six assists.</TE>
<TE>   Shareef Abdur-Rahim made 14 of 16 free throws and finished with 32
points and seven rebounds for Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Robinson had 15 points and nine rebounds for the Hawks, who
lost their third consecutive game, all on the road.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 97, New York 91 -- Baron Davis took over in overtime
when the Knicks didn't have a point guard to defend him and led the
Hornets to the victory in Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Davis scored five of his 24 points and had two of his seven
assists in overtime, when the Hornets scored the final 10 points of
the game. He shot 10 for 23 from the field as New Orleans won on the
road for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   With Charlie Ward sitting out because of a bruised leg, the Knicks
were without a point guard in overtime after Howard Eisley fouled out
late in regulation. Davis made the most of the situation because the
Knicks had no one who could stay with him.</TE>
<TE>   New York took a four-point lead early in overtime, but Davis
scored on a drive, made a three-point shot and assisted on a layup by
Stacey Augmon that gave New Orleans its first lead, 92-91.</TE>
<TE>   For the Knicks, Allan Houston scored 27 but missed four of his
five shots in overtime. Lee Nailon added 18 against his former team.</TE>

<HD>Sorenstam Wins 10th Title This Season</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Annika Sorenstam didn't let a cold affect her bid to become the LPGA
Tour's first 10-time winner in 34 years. In fact, she used her
weakened condition as a swing aid.</LD>
<LD>   "There's an expression, 'Watch out for the sick player,' " said
Sorenstam. "In my case, sometimes it's good because I don't swing too
hard, and swing smoothly. When I don't play well, it's when I'm
trying to swing too hard. When I play like this, I don't swing hard."</LD>
<LD>   The Swedish star birdied the last two par-five holes Sunday at
Otsu, Japan, for a five-under-par 67 and a 15-under 201, giving her a
two-stroke victory over South Korea's Grace Park in the Mizuno
Classic.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel better than I sound," Sorenstam said. "I told my caddie,
Terry McNamara, today that I'm in the position that I want to be in
and that this is what I've been waiting for -- to win my 10th."</TE>
<TE>   She's the first player to win 10 times in a season since Kathy
Whitworth and Carol Mann in 1968. Mickey Wright reached double
figures four times, setting the record with 13 victories in 1963 and
winning 11 times in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, 32, earned $169,500 for her 41st LPGA Tour victory to
push her record total to $2,648,904. She also won events in Australia
and Sweden, giving her 12 worldwide victories in 24 starts this year.</TE>
<TE>   Park, the winner last week in the World Ladies Match Play
Championship in Narita, Japan, shot a 68. See Re Pak, a five-time
winner this year, finished third at 12 under.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie and Bernhard Langer shared the Volvo Masters
title when darkness halted play after two playoff holes at
Sotogrande, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Langer shot a four-under 67 and Montgomerie had a one-under 70.
They finished tied at three-under 281, and each made par on the two
playoff holes, Nos. 18 and 10.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie birdied Nos. 16 and 17, but missed an eight-foot putt
for par on the last hole of regulation. He offset four bogeys with
five birdies in the final round. Langer had an eagle, three birdies
and a bogey in the final round.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fuzzy Zoeller took the Senior Slam lead on the 15th hole and held
on to win by one stroke at Superstition Mountain, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Zoeller edged Don Pooley to win $300,000 in the tournament, which
featured this year's Senior PGA Tour major championship winners.
Stewart Ginn finished three strokes back and Jim Thorpe was seven
behind.</TE>

<TE>   Cheryl Ford, the daughter of NBA star Karl Malone, had 24 points
and 15 rebounds to lead No. 16 Louisiana Tech to an 85-76 victory
over No. 7 Texas Tech in the first game of the State Farm Classic at
Knoxville, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   The game marked the debut of Kurt Budke as Louisiana Tech's coach.
He succeeded Leon Barmore, who retired in August after 17 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Lady Techsters, who improved to 25-4 in season openers, did
not trail after taking the lead four minutes into the game. Plenette
Pierson led Texas Tech with 25 points.</TE>
<TE>   In the second game, Gwen Jackson scored 22 of her 29 points in the
second half to help No. 2 Tennessee to a 94-68 victory over No. 22
Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Theresa Schuknecht led the Sooners with 27 points and 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball</TE>
<TE>   Alex Cabrera homered and drove in three runs to lead the Japanese
All-Stars to an 8-4 victory over the major league All-Stars in the
first game of a seven-game exhibition series at Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds struck out three times for the major league All-Stars.
The last time he struck out three times in a game was Aug. 8, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrera, formerly with the Arizona Diamondbacks and now with the
Seibu Lions, homered in the top of the seventh against Randy Wolf.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrera tied Japan's season home run record with 55 this year.</TE>

<LD>Vladimir Orszagh scored at 15:55 of the third period, Tomas Vokoun
had 33 saves and the Nashville Predators defeated Colorado, 4-3,
Sunday night, prolonging the Avalanche's home-ice futility.</LD>
<LD>   Nashville won for the first time in 13 road games dating to last
season. Colorado fell to 0-4-3-1 at home -- the worst home start in
the franchise's 24-year history.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Sakic's 10th goal of the season on a power play pulled the
Avalanche into a 3-3 tie at 8:15 of the third period.</LD>
<TE>   During an ensuing scramble in front of the Colorado net, Orszagh
poked the puck past Patrick Roy. Roy, who sat out the last three
games because of a sore left hip, had 24 saves.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 3, Dallas 2 -- John Blake scored the
tiebreaking goal at 7:43 of the third period at Uniondale, N.Y. The

Uniondale since a 5-3 loss Feb. 4, 1996.</TE>

<KH>SAN FRANCISCO 17, KANSAS CITY 13</KH>
<HD>49ers Eclipse Chiefs' Stars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>From the Kansas City Chiefs' first snap to their final play, Julian
Peterson was all over Tony Gonzalez -- and everybody else on the San
Francisco 49ers' surging defense piled on Priest Holmes.</LD>
<LD>   Garrison Hearst and Kevan Barlow each rushed for a touchdown, and
San Francisco bottled up Kansas City's offensive stars as the 49ers
beat the Chiefs, 17-13, Sunday for their sixth win in seven games.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco (7-2) got only 323 total yards from its high-powered
offense and was shut out in the second half, but elevated its play on
defense to hold Kansas City (4-5) -- the NFL's highest scoring team
at 32.4 points a game -- to its lowest total of the season.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a dominant game," 49er linebacker Derek Smith said. "When
you have a performance like that, it's not one player. It's
everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson, the 49ers' third-year linebacker, drew one of the
toughest chores: man-to-man coverage of Gonzalez, the Chiefs' All-Pro
tight end. No problem, Peterson told his coaches all week long -- and
then he backed up his words with the biggest game of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson held Gonzalez to one catch for six yards -- and when the
Chiefs drove to midfield on their final possession, Peterson ended
the threat with an acrobatic deflection of Trent Green's fourth-down
pass to Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought we'd clamp down on their offense like that, but
we had a great plan," Peterson said. "The guys were giving me a lot
of the credit, but I'd say that everybody came together."</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers also held NFL rushing leader Holmes to 51 yards rushing
and one reception, though he scored his league-leading 16th touchdown
on a 12-yard run in the second quarter.</TE>

<KH>GREEN BAY 40, DETROIT 14</KH>
<HD>Schroeder's Return Is Far From a Hit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREEN BAY, Wis.</DL>
<LD>With the Green Bay Packers holding a 37-point lead, the Lambeau Field
crowd had just one request for Darren Sharper.</LD>
<LD>   They wanted to him to put a hit on former teammate Bill Schroeder
during the Packers' 40-14 rout of the Lions on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "People in the stands were yelling at me to take a shot at him and
hit him," Sharper said. "But he didn't catch any passes, so I didn't
get an opportunity to."</LD>
<TE>   Schroeder dropped three passes, one of which was intercepted by
Marques Anderson -- a rookie safety out of UCLA -- and returned for a
touchdown. Schroeder, who signed with the Lions as a free agent after
seven seasons with the Packers, also bobbled away a pass in the end
zone as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to keep him oh-for-whatever he was, like we did today,"
Sharper said.</TE>
<TE>   The shutout of Schroeder was the icing for Green Bay, which
improved its NFL-best record to 8-1 while taking a five-game lead
over second-place Detroit (3-6) in the NFC North.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Favre's sprained left knee gave him no problems in his
second start since getting hurt, as he threw for 351 yards and two
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "Green Bay put a football clinic on today," Lion Coach Marty
Mornhinweg said.</TE>
<TE>   The only negative for Green Bay was injuries to running backs
Ahman Green (mild concussion) and Najeh Davenport (sprained ankle).
Green had 12 carries for 50 yards and didn't play after halftime.
Davenport gained 73 yards in 10 carries before getting hurt in the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Driver caught a career-high 11 passes for 130 yards in
Green Bay's seventh consecutive victory -- their longest streak in
the regular season since 1963.</TE>

<KH>NEW ENGLAND 33, CHICAGO 30</KH>
<HD>Patriots Pull Off a Comeback of Super Proportion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHAMPAIGN, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Tom Brady's poise and David Patten's fancy footwork combined to give
the New England Patriots one of their most memorable comeback
victories.</LD>
<LD>   With a wild finish that saw officials spend nearly as much time
viewing replays as patrolling the field, the defending Super Bowl
champion Patriots came back from a three-touchdown deficit in the
second half to beat the Chicago Bears, 33-30, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "When you're down three touchdowns in the third quarter, it shows
what kind of fight you have," Brady said after his 20-yard touchdown
pass to Patten with 21 seconds left gave the Patriots an improbable
victory -- and sent the stunned Bears to their seventh consecutive
loss.</LD>
<TE>   "We were down three touchdowns, and then we scored and we're down
two, and I said, 'Man, we've got a shot,' " Brady added.</TE>
<TE>   On a third and three from the Bear 20, he found Patten in the back
of the end zone. Patten had a step on defensive back R.W. McQuarters
and dived to haul in the pass.</TE>
<TE>   Officials initially ruled a touchdown, but they reviewed the play.</TE>
<TE>   They upheld the ruling on the field, saying that Patten had his
right foot down and was able to drag his left foot in the end zone
before going out.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of the best catches I've ever seen under pressure,"
Brady said.</TE>
<TE>   McQuarters wasn't so sure it was a catch at all. "From the looks
of it, the receiver's foot was past the line," he said. "I thought
the second one was questionable. I guess it could have gone either
way. It hurts."</TE>
<TE>   "This was a wild one. I can't remember ever being in a game like
that one before," Patriot Coach Bill Belichick said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither can the frustrated Bears. Their latest loss in this most
disappointing season was one they'll never forget.</TE>
<TE>   Not once, but twice in the final minute, video replays didn't go
their way.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago (2-7) led, 27-6, in the third quarter and took a 30-19
lead with 5:22 left on Paul Edinger's 32-yard field goal, and the
Bears thought they had stopped New England's final drive when
defensive lineman Brian Robinson stepped in front of Brady's pass
with just under a minute left for an apparent interception.</TE>
<TE>   But Robinson juggled the ball as he was going down before losing
it. Officials initially ruled that he had intercepted the pass and
fumbled before teammate Rosevelt Colvin recovered.</TE>
<TE>   But officials reviewed the play and said Robinson never had
possession, resulting in an incomplete pass. That gave the Patriots
one final chance, with a fourth down at the Bear 30 with 54 seconds
to go.</TE>
<TE>   New England (5-4) was out of timeouts, but Brady sneaked three
yards on fourth down to keep the drive going.</TE>

<HD>League's Studded With Tie Fighters</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Dungy won a game in Philadelphia and Matt Hasselbeck won a game
in the NFL on Sunday, thus debunking two of the longest-standing
myths in football.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the Atlanta Falcons and the Pittsburgh Steelers
combined for 1,092 total yards, 767 passing yards and 68 points to
obliterate another myth propped up by the coaches, pundits and
stuffed shirts who have worked overtime to keep their sport clouded
in its hyper-masculine mystique:</LD>
<LD>   There's no tying in football.</LD>
<TE>   It simply isn't supposed to happen. It has been outlawed at the
highest level of the college game, with teams forced to engage in an
inflate-your-final-score carnival rather than leave the field on even
terms -- or, in the parlance of football coaches, "in disgrace."</TE>
<TE>   On the professional level, the tie was thought to have died in
1974, when the NFL instituted the playing of "sudden death" extra
periods -- or, in the parlance of NFL inter-office correspondence,
"how we crack back on Al Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1974, 333 NFL games have failed to produce a loser by the
conclusion of regulation play. This is not a good thing. We cannot
have this happening in a capitalistic society.</TE>
<TE>   So, at the end of each of these 333 unresolved competitions, a
coin, fittingly enough, is flipped and the teams play on for another
15 minutes, or until one exhausted side yields a score, whichever
comes first.</TE>
<TE>   And 317 times out of 333, a loser has been declared, often without
ever getting its hands on the football. Including last season's Snow
Bowl against New England, the Oakland Raiders have seen their last
three overtimes end the same way -- lose the coin flip, lose the game
without running a single offensive play.</TE>
<TE>   As the league office sees it, sudden death has been a spectacular
success.</TE>
<TE>   By now, after 28 years of sudden defeats, NFL coaches and players
are conditioned.</TE>
<TE>   Falcon quarterback Michael Vick, after rallying his team from a
17-point fourth-quarter deficit but failing to score an overtime
point in an eventual 34-34 tie with Pittsburgh, called the result
"very, very, very disappointing ... I'm hurt right now."</TE>
<TE>   Steeler Coach Bill Cowher, after watching quarterback Tommy Maddox
pass for a club-record 473 yards, including 50 on a completion that
left Plaxico Burress inches short of the winning score as overtime
expired, didn't know how to react.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been here before," he said. "I told the team I don't
know what to tell them. I've never had a tie."</TE>
<TE>   Cowher set his jaw and paused, because this is a procedure that
takes some time, and defiantly added, "I do know we didn't lose. I
will say that. We did not lose today."</TE>
<TE>   No one associated with the Steelers had been associated with a tie
since 1974 and the NFL's very first regular-season overtime game. Joe
Gilliam was Pittsburgh's quarterback that day. Denver was the
opponent. Final score: Steelers 35, Broncos 35.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL hadn't seen a tie in five years. The last one was a 7-7
draw between the New York Giants and the Washington Redskins on Nov.
23, 1997. In some cultures, a deadlocked outcome is considered the
most honorable result a sporting competition can yield. But not NFL
culture. Redskin quarterback Gus Frerotte was so frustrated by events
that day, he head-butted a wall and knocked himself woozy.</TE>
<TE>   A little perspective, people: Atlanta and Pittsburgh, two of the
league's hottest teams, both began the game with four-game winning
streaks. Now, after putting on as good a show as pro football fans
have seen this season, the Falcons and Steelers leave with five-game
unbeaten streaks.</TE>
<TE>   (Of course, the Falcons, at 5-3-1, dropped another half-game off
the pace of NFC South rival New Orleans, which won Sunday, 34-24 over
Carolina, to improve to 7-2. Which could be the reason for Vick's
hanging head.)</TE>
<TE>   Maddox was involved in history on several fronts. First, his 473
yards broke a 44-year-old Steeler record, eclipsing the old mark,
409, set by Bobby Layne in 1958. Second, he and St. Louis' Marc
Bulger, who threw for 453 yards in the Rams' 28-24 victory over San
Diego, became the first pair of NFL quarterbacks to pass for more
than 450 yards on the same day.</TE>
<TE>   Think about that one for a minute. Maybe sit down and pour
yourself a cold beverage.</TE>
<TE>   In the 83-year history of the NFL, in a league that has been
graced by Unitas and Starr, Bradshaw and Namath, Marino and Montana,
Elway and Favre, only once have two quarterbacks passed for 450 yards
on the same Sunday ... and their names are Maddox and Bulger.</TE>
<TE>   This just in: Kurt Warner reports the little finger on his
throwing hand is feeling much, much better.</TE>
<TE>   This is life in the new NFL, where nothing (with the possible
exceptions of Favre and the Cincinnati Bengals) is reliable and
everything is disposable.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: Dungy, who couldn't win a playoff game in
Philadelphia when he was armed with Tampa Bay's arsenal, arrives at
the Vet with a slumping Indianapolis team down to its fourth-string
running back ... and reels off five touchdowns in a 35-13 rout of the
Eagles.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-string running back is suddenly unstoppable, rushing
for 114 yards and two touchdowns against Philadelphia's second-ranked
defense. The name is Mungro, James Mungro, which sounds like a
character out of "Blazing Saddles" -- Mungro like carries! -- instead
of an anonymous rookie making his first NFL start under hostile
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   But then, this is the league of Tom Brady, who pioneered the
bench-to-stardom bit a year ago, and continued to push the
credibility envelope Sunday. Down by 11 points with 5:22 to go, Brady
rallied New England to two touchdowns and a 33-30 victory over
Chicago, saving the Patriots' season and effectively crushing the
Bears'.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly luckless, the Bears lost their seventh straight game when
they lost two late video reviews. The first negated a potential
game-clinching interception by Chicago's Brian Robinson, officials
declaring that the replay showed Robinson never had possession of the
bobbling ball. The second upheld Patriot David Patten's
back-of-the-end-zone reception with 21 seconds left, officials ruling
that Patten touched down with both feet in bounds, just barely.</TE>
<TE>   That left the Bears 2-7 and winless since September. All things
considered, they probably would have been happy to take a tie.</TE>

<HD>Ravens Know How to Handle a Bungle</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Lamont Brightful and Adalius Thomas made sure that Ed Reed's
premature-celebration gaffe became just a footnote for the Baltimore
Ravens.</LD>
<LD>   Brightful returned a punt 95 yards for a touchdown, and Thomas
scored on a 25-yard interception return to lead Baltimore to a 38-27
victory over the Cincinnati Bengals Sunday. It was the Ravens' sixth
consecutive home victory over the Bengals.</LD>
<LD>   Reed, a rookie safety, also had a chance to score his first NFL
touchdown. But after picking off Jon Kitna's pass, he held the ball
out in celebration as he neared the end zone and had it batted away
at the end of a 46-yard return.</LD>
<TE>   T.J. Houshmandzadeh swatted the ball from Reed's outstretched arm
at the eight-yard line, and Peter Warrick recovered in the end zone
for a touchback to keep the score 7-7.</TE>
<TE>   "Like a kid in the candy store with no money. You see the candy
but you just can't get it," Reed said sheepishly. "I won't make the
same mistake twice."</TE>
<TE>   He showed that he'd already learned from his blunder when he
intercepted a pass in the fourth quarter. This time, he tucked the
ball to his side until he was tackled. The turnover set up Jamal
Lewis' second touchdown, a three-yard run that made it 38-20 with
6:14 left. Besides his two interceptions, Reed made a key block on
Brightful's spectacular punt return. After setting up a field goal
with a 54-yard kickoff return, Brightful gave Baltimore a 24-14
halftime lead with his team-record runback.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis ran for 135 yards as the Ravens (4-5) won for the first time
in three games and denied Cincinnati (1-8) a second consecutive
victory following last week's rout of expansion Houston.</TE>

<HD>A Saint Is Redeemed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Donte Stallworth stood alone on the sideline with a look of defeat.
He had just dropped another pass, this one in the end zone, and he
was certain his quarterback would stop looking to him.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Aaron Brooks gave the rookie a pep talk, then culminated
a 95-yard drive by completing a seven-yard touchdown pass to
Stallworth with 31 seconds left for the go-ahead score Sunday in New
Orleans Saints' 34-24 victory over Carolina.</LD>
<LD>   "He was feeling down, so I went over there and put my arm around
him and told him not to worry about it," Brooks said. "The more he
tried to fight it, the worse it was going to get. So I told him to
forget it, and I'd look for him again later."</LD>
<TE>   The touchdown put the Saints ahead, 27-24, and Charles Grant
returned Rodney Peete's fumble 34 yards for a score as time ran out.
The Saints (7-2) matched their best start since 1992. Carolina (3-6)
lost for the sixth consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by the return of Peete, the Panthers went ahead, 24-20,
on a 15-yard touchdown pass play to Wesley Walls with 3:31 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Saints started the next drive from their five, and it looked
as if the Panthers could end the game after Reggie Howard intercepted
a Brooks pass. But the play was negated when officials called Howard
for a push-off, and the Saints kept moving.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks found Stallworth for a 38-yard pass play to the Carolina 10
and two plays later they teamed up for the go-ahead score. "It's
frustrating when you've got the game and it gets put on the defense's
shoulders, and we don't step up and respond," Panther defensive end
Julius Peppers said.</TE>

<KH>SEATTLE 27, ARIZONA 6</KH>
<HD>Seahawks Only Need Half an Effort</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>For one half, Mike Holmgren must have thought he was watching his
glorious old Green Bay Packers, not his sputtering Seattle Seahawks.</LD>
<LD>   A methodical first-half manhandling of the Arizona Cardinals was
more than enough to send the Seahawks to a 27-6 victory on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Passing the ball and running the ball effectively, the Seahawks
scored on all five possessions in the first half. Matt Hasselbeck
completed 23 of 31 passes for 260 yards -- four yards shy of the
career best he set a week ago against Washington.</LD>
<TE>   Neither team scored in the second half, when Arizona fumbled the
ball away three times inside the Seattle 10. "It was ugly," Arizona's
Jake Plummer said. "It just kept getting worse and worse."</TE>
<TE>   Marcel Shipp fumbled after Arizona had reached the one- and
five-yard line in the third quarter. Both were recovered by
linebacker Marcus Bell -- who grew up in tiny St. Johns, Ariz.
Plummer fumbled a bad snap from backup center Jason Starkey at the
Seahawks' eight with 7:30 to go in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle (3-6), last in the NFL in rushing defense at 173 yards a
game, held Arizona (4-5) to 111 on the ground, 29 in the first half.
Thomas Jones, who rushed for 174 yards in Arizona's 24-13 victory
over Seattle in Week 2, had only 24 yards in 11 carries.</TE>
<TE>   All the Cardinals -- heartily booed throughout by a crowd of
29,252 in 73,000-seat Sun Devil Stadium -- could manage were field
goals of 40 and 27 yards by Bill Gramatica.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunday was one of those days that demonstrates how far the NFL has
advanced since a few years ago when the lament was: "Where are the
quarterbacks?"</LD>
<LD>   Not only did Marc Bulger, cut by New Orleans two years ago, star
for the St. Louis Rams for the fourth straight week (he passed for
453 yards), but so did a lot of quarterbacks who have survived hard
times.</LD>
<LD>   Add Tommy Maddox, Kerry Collins and Aaron Brooks to the
quarterbacks who had a big Sunday after coming from nowhere or
disappearing. Maddox had 473 yards in Pittsburgh's 34-34 tie with
Atlanta, marking the first time in NFL history that two quarterbacks
had thrown for more than 450 yards in one day.</LD>
<TE>   Even Todd Bouman, who has been on the end of the Minnesota bench
for five seasons and once battled Jay Fiedler for the third-string
job, replaced Daunte Culpepper against the New York Giants and
directed the Vikings to two touchdowns in an ultimately futile
comeback attempt.</TE>
<TE>   How out-of-nowhere has Maddox's strong run been for the Steelers?
ESPN doesn't even have a mug shot of him on their Web site, instead
running the silhouette of an unknown person.</TE>
<TE>   Comparing Maddox's numbers in the seven games he has played this
season with Kordell Stewart's numbers in his last seven games:</TE>
<TE>   Maddox has completed 133 of 206 passes (64.6%) for 1,678 yards, 15
touchdowns and eight interceptions for a passer rating of 90.1. The
Steelers are 5-1-1 in those games.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has completed 120 of 211 passes (56.9%) for 1,318 yards,
seven touchdowns and 15 interceptions for a passer rating of 56.9.
The Steelers are 2-5 in those games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Making his NFL debut against the Giants, Vikings' rookie Bryant
McKinnie gave up his first-ever sack but otherwise looked strong at
left tackle. He played there for all but three series, totaling 41
plays.</TE>
<TE>   McKinnie was originally supposed to play between 15 and 25 snaps,
but he showed up in better shape than the Vikings anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there were some scheme things that maybe we could've done
better, but he competed," Coach Mike Tice said.</TE>
<TE>   "He is going to be a force. And he'll be better next week."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's key injuries:</TE>
<TE>   * Ram running back Marshall Faulk sprained his left ankle, but the
injury shouldn't force him to miss any games.</TE>
<TE>   * Cincinnati defensive tackle Oliver Gibson tore his left
Achilles' tendon, and cornerback Ligarius Jennings tore his left ACL.
Both are out for the season.</TE>
<TE>   * Giant wide receiver Tim Carter tore his Achilles' tendon and is
out for the season.</TE>
<TE>   * Green Bay running backs Ahman Green (mild concussion) and Najeh
Davenport (sprained ankle) left the Packers' game against the Detroit
Lions.</TE>
<TE>   * Tennessee Titan tight end Frank Wycheck was hit on the second
possession of the game against Houston and didn't return because of a
concussion.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Coach Bruce Arena gathers a new-look U.S. men's national team
around him in Washington today to begin preparing for Sunday's match
against El Salvador at RFK Stadium, he will do so in the knowledge
that much-tougher opponents lie ahead.</LD>
<LD>   The draw for the FIFA Confederations Cup in France in June has yet
to be held, but FIFA already has made decisions that have an impact
on the eight teams taking part.</LD>
<LD>   To begin with, the present and former world champions, Brazil and
France, have been kept apart, with each heading one four-nation
group. In addition, FIFA has dropped the Parc des Princes stadium in
Paris as one of the venues, meaning that the tournament will take
place in the Parisian suburb of Saint-Denis, Lyon and Saint-Etienne.</LD>
<TE>   Because countries from the same confederation cannot play each
other in the first round, South American champion Colombia will be in
the same group as France, and Turkey will be in the same group as
Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves Cameroon, Japan, New Zealand and the U.S. All,
including the Americans, know that they will play either France and
Colombia or Brazil and Turkey in the first round of the June 18-29
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Protest</TE>
<TE>   Enrico Preziosi, president of the Italian Serie A club Como,
resigned Sunday in protest against what he believes is biased
officiating in the league.</TE>
<TE>   His decision was announced shortly after Como lost to Bologna,
1-0, on a penalty kick awarded by referee Alfredo Trentalange.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we can say Bologna 1, Como 0, goal scorer Trentalange,"
Preziosi said. "Today we saw scandalous refereeing, all in favor of
Bologna. I criticized the [league] referees during the week and this
was the reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "So it is better that I go. I don't want to be part of this world
any more."</TE>
<TE>   Referee Praise</TE>
<TE>   The FIFA-sanctioned one-match experiment that allowed referee
Laurent Duhamel and his linesmen to communicate via radio headsets
during Saturday night's French league game between Lille and Nantes
proved so successful that Frederic Thiriez, the league president,
said he wants to see it used more extensively.</TE>
<TE>   Duhamel also praised the innovation.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very positive," he said. "On several occasions it meant
that I could react immediately -- whether it was over the
substitutions or the seriousness of a foul."</TE>
<TE>   More widespread use of the technology would have to be approved by
FIFA.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn Retires</TE>
<TE>   One of Ireland's longest-serving and most popular players,
Sunderland striker Niall Quinn, announced his retirement at age 36.</TE>
<TE>   The Dublin-born forward had retired from international competition
after the Korea/Japan '02 World Cup, but a back injury caused him to
leave the sport altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn, who played 91 games for Ireland, began his professional
career with Arsenal in 1983 and played for Manchester City before
joining Sunderland.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, during an emotional farewell ceremony at Sunderland's
Stadium of Light at halftime of the game against Tottenham Hotspur,
Quinn donated $1.59 million to charity. The money had been raised on
his behalf at a testimonial game last season.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona Blues</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona has reached an incentive-based agreement with its
players by which they would share a reported $6-million bonus for
winning the Spanish championship this season and a $10-million bonus
for winning the European Champions League.</TE>
<TE>   Two Drop Out</TE>
<TE>   The number of countries seeking to win the soccer gold medal at
the Athens 2004 Olympic Games has been reduced by two after
Mauritania and Guinea Bissau dropped out of qualifying competition in
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Their decision allowed the Cape Verde Islands and Gambia a bye
into the next round.</TE>

<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>No Steeler quarterback had passed for more yards than Tommy Maddox
did Sunday. And no Falcon quarterback had played a better fourth
quarter that Michael Vick.</LD>
<LD>   Neither team knew how to react to a game so exciting, so dramatic
-- and in the end, so empty.</LD>
<LD>   Vick rallied Atlanta from 17 points down in the fourth quarter,
and the Falcons withstood Maddox's franchise-record 473 yards passing
to tie Pittsburgh, 34-34, Sunday. It was the NFL's first tie in five
years, and the 16th in league history.</LD>
<TE>   The Steelers, traditionally a blue-collar team that wins with
defense and the running game, piled up 645 yards as Maddox and
receiver Plaxico Burress each set club yardage records, yet still
couldn't help their team win.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe it. For us to do the things we did -- I mean,
Tommy almost threw for 500 yards -- and to fall short, it's
unbelievable," wide receiver Hines Ward said.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox completed 28 of 41 passes and easily broke Bobby Layne's
1958 team record of 409 yards. Burress made nine catches for 253
yards and two touchdowns, but Pittsburgh couldn't hold a 34-17 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox's career game came in only his sixth start for the
Steelers, and it happened against the coach who drafted him,
Atlanta's Dan Reeves. Maddox was selected by Denver and went to the
Giants when Reeves coached there, but Maddox's NFL career was a bust
until this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I love him to death, but I still wanted to beat him. Man, I
wanted that game," Maddox said.</TE>
<TE>   Even after Pittsburgh's Todd Peterson and Atlanta's Jay Feely had
overtime field-goal attempts blocked, the Steelers nearly won. With
only one second on the clock, Maddox lofted a 50-yard pass that
Burress caught at the Falcon one-yard line. Half of Burress' body was
in the end zone but the ball wasn't, and the Steelers didn't have
enough time to run another play.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't win but, we didn't lose," Burress said. "It's so
disappointing. You have this uneasy feeling that you lost, but you
know you really didn't."</TE>
<TE>   It was the NFL's first tie since the Giants and Redskins played to
a 7-7 stalemate on Nov. 23, 1997. Since the NFL implemented overtime
in 1974, there have been 332 games go the extra period, but only 16
of those ended without either team scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams remained unbeaten in their last five games and are
5-3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Vick pulled off the comeback despite being forced into being
one-dimensional. The Steelers' blitzes limited him to 52 yards
rushing, but one of his few successful scrambles was an 11-yard
touchdown run in the final minute of regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the constant pressure, Vick dodged and weaved his way to a
294-yard passing day, going 24 for 46 -- all while being sacked four
times.</TE>

<KH>TENNESSEE 17, HOUSTON 10</KH>
<HD>Texans Make Titans Work</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Following the first game between Houston's old team and its new one,
the Tennessee Titans went out of their way to praise the expansion
Texans.</LD>
<LD>   Although Tennessee won Sunday's game, 17-10, the Texans earned
their opponents' respect by showing that this could soon become an
interesting rivalry.</LD>
<LD>   Steve McNair threw for two touchdowns and Eddie George ran for 86
yards to help the Titans -- formerly the Houston Oilers -- defeat the
team that succeeded them.</LD>
<TE>   "People can criticize," Tennessee defensive end Kevin Carter said,
anticipating dismay at the close score. "But again, you have to
capitalize on your chances. One thing people don't realize is that
Houston team has some really good players."</TE>
<TE>   The Texans (2-7) got within a touchdown when David Carr completed
a 10-yard scoring pass to Jarrod Baxter with 3:05 left. Houston got
the ball back, and the Titans (5-4) didn't seal the victory until
Lance Schulters intercepted Carr's pass at the Tennessee 46 with 1:11
left.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of scary there at the end," Titan defensive tackle
Henry Ford said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth consecutive victory for the Titans, who stayed
tied with Indianapolis for first place in the AFC South almost in
spite of themselves. They had trouble moving the ball against the
Texans, who intercepted two of McNair's passes, one in the end zone.
Tennessee had only 251 total yards.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee, however, allowed Houston only 233 total yards and
sacked Carr four times.</TE>
