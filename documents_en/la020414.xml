<HD>Moorpark Takes Second</HD>
<DH>Competition: The team narrowly misses claiming its second
national title as a Wisconsin school wins.</DH>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Nine Moorpark High School students fell short in their bid to reclaim
the U.S. Academic Decathlon title Saturday, coming in a close second
to a rookie team from Wisconsin.</LD>
<LD>   Waukesha West High School scored 48,871 out of a possible 60,000
points in its first-ever shot at the national title, trumping
Moorpark by just 579 points.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm happy for Waukesha, but I'm sad for us," said Moorpark
student Julie Bristol. "We worked hard, but I guess they worked
harder."</LD>
<TE>   Throughout the ceremony at the Phoenix Civic Plaza, Moorpark
decathletes sat with nervous looks on their faces, taking turns
hugging the team's mascot, a stuffed monkey.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark had been vying to regain the national title it won in
1999--the first time a Ventura County school grabbed the top honor.
Simi Valley High School competed in 2000 and finished in second
place.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's champions were from El Camino Real High School in
Woodland Hills, which has placed first or second in the national
contest four times in the last six years. Schools from the Los
Angeles Unified School District have taken home the championship six
times in the decathlon's 21-year history.</TE>
<TE>   And until Saturday night, only Texas and California squads had
ever won the competition. "We're like the young gunslingers," said
Duane Stein, Wisconsin's coach. "We may not be very experienced, but
we're fast."</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark went into the finals with the highest state score in the
country--48,603 points--and was the favorite. In addition to the
team's second-place finish, Moorpark's students won dozens of
individual medals, including first prizes in art and essay.</TE>
<TE>   During the two-day competition in Phoenix, Moorpark's students
were among about 500 teenage contestants who took multiple-choice
tests in six subjects, wrote essays, delivered both impromptu and
prepared speeches and gave personal interviews.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, decathletes competed in the Super Quiz, a two-part
event that includes the only public portion of the competition. On a
stage before hundreds of cheering fans, students fielded 45 questions
on the topic of the Internet and society. Moorpark's squad took first
place with 31 correct answers.</TE>
<TE>   One of Moorpark's coaches, Larry Jones, had been worried about the
team having to compete before other teams in the subjective interview
and speech categories, fearing that could cost the team up to 1,000
points. Jones said before the ceremony Saturday that he was proud of
his team.</TE>
<TE>   "They still learned what they learned, and they still have the
friendships they built," Jones said. "No one can take that away from
them."</TE>
<TE>   The national competition concluded hundreds of hours of
preparation for the high school students, who have spent the last
nine months learning complex concepts in macroeconomics, memorizing
facts from eight decades of country music and reading Alan Paton's
"Cry, the Beloved Country" half a dozen times.</TE>
<TE>   "They worked harder than any kids I have ever seen," said English
teacher Kara Bettencourt, Moorpark's second coach. "They put in 15 to
16 hours a day, and this was second to nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The exhausted teenagers slept in Saturday morning and then headed
to the mall for some shopping before the real anxiety set in.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt great to wake up in the morning knowing I didn't have to
study all day," said 18-year-old Johnny Mendoza, who plans to attend
Stanford University. "We're doing all the stuff we didn't get to do
before."</TE>
<TE>   Though the competition is billed as a battle of brains, not all
decathletes are honors students. The program requires students with a
range of grade point averages. If there is a secret to Moorpark's
long history of success at the decathlon, Jones said, it's picking
the right combination of kids.</TE>
<TE>   Every year he pores through the academic records of every junior
and senior at the school, looking at GPAs, standardized test scores
and talking with teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Once the team is in place, he spends many hours with them after
school, on weekends and during vacations, drilling them on subjects,
administering practice tests, critiquing essays and listening to
speeches.</TE>
<TE>   He is lucky, he says, because most of the kids have gone through
Moorpark's schools their whole lives. "I get a lot of the credit, but
I only get them at the very end," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This year's team--Bristol, Mendoza, Nathaniel Jones, Dean Reich,
Andy Song, Michelle Kim, Sheena Sidhu, Sergio Suarez and Jerome
Yang--won the school's sixth Ventura County decathlon in February and
second state championship last month.</TE>

<HD>Neighborhood Finds a New Identity</HD>
<DH>Lake Balboa: Residents pull away from Van Nuys to improve
property values and create a new image. Those left behind take it as
an insult.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ah, Lake Balboa. You can almost see the bougainvillea-lined trail
leading to the shore.</LD>
<LD>   It was just another place in the San Fernando Valley until last
week when it broke off from Van Nuys, becoming the latest
neighborhood to officially be recognized by the city of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Except there is no trail to the shore--because there is no lake.</LD>
<TE>   The boundaries, which were narrowed from an earlier proposal that
included Van Nuys Airport, fall short of encompassing the lake for
which it is named.</TE>
<TE>   But Lake Balboa, the neighborhood, does include Van Nuys Golf
Course and Birmingham High School.</TE>
<TE>   The designation, which carries no political significance, was the
result of City Councilman Dennis Zine making good on a campaign
promise.</TE>
<TE>   It incensed some Van Nuys residents who were left out. But for
those within the two-square-mile neighborhood, it is a fresh start to
creating a new image.</TE>
<TE>   "It's us coming together to combat what we saw as decay with
ever-increasing velocity approaching us from both sides," said Bryan
Brannon, who led a homeowners group seeking the change.</TE>
<TE>   That decay, which has come to define Van Nuys for many, is evident
in graffiti, streetwalkers and shattered glass.</TE>
<TE>   In her book, "A Year in Van Nuys," humorist Sandra Tsing Loh
described homes in the "bravely tattered" community as "perhaps a bit
too gaily painted, every third or fourth bungalow the color of
eye-piercing sorbet--lime green, raspberry cream, banana yellow. "</TE>
<TE>   Lake Balboa enjoys a more peaceful appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the homes are buffered from the busy streets that slice it
into quadrants: Sherman Way, Vanowen Street, Victory Boulevard and
Balboa Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't put up any physical walls, but it gives us a body of
people dedicated to working together in our area to improve community
standards," Brannon said.</TE>
<TE>   "That was impossible to do within the context of Van Nuys ... too
many people with too many interests."</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the renaming movement, said Lake Balboa resident
Richard Reimer, was a desire to raise property values without having
to move.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that the name has changed, I'm a bit more snobbish when
people ask, 'Where do you live?'" said Reimer, a letter carrier. "If
you tell people you live in Van Nuys, they assume you live in a
beat-up house with a gang next door selling crack, or whatever. At
least now, [potential homebuyers] will look at the property."</TE>
<TE>   But for all of the badmouthing of the old hometown, the Lake
Balboa homes look much like any of the better parts of the remaining
Van Nuys, said Don Schultz, president of the Van Nuys Homeowners
Assn. Entry-level homes in the mid-$200,000 range, more expensive
houses and large apartment complexes can be found on either side of
the border.</TE>
<TE>   "We take this as an insult, because we've been working hard to get
Van Nuys to be the nice, middle-class neighborhood it was," said
Schultz, who lives half a mile east of Lake Balboa. "These little
secession movements portend to be not only elitist but [also]
racist."</TE>
<TE>   Renaming groups have taken chunks of Van Nuys for the last 12
years. A few blocks in southern Van Nuys defected to Sherman Oaks and
Valley Glen broke off. Now this. All told, Van Nuys has shrunk by a
third and lost as many as 20,000 of its estimated 130,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   "If they all really cared about Van Nuys, they would have helped
us fight the graffiti and other problems from the start and we
wouldn't have so many problems," Schultz said.</TE>

<HD>Century City Project Upsets Some Residents</HD>
<DH>They bemoan loss of Shubert Theatre, retail outlets.
Developer says 'cultural amenities' are in new plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Levi likes what he sees in Century City.</LD>
<LD>   "I have a view from Beverly Hills to Long Beach," he says. "I have
48 feet of windows and a balcony. I look down on 200-plus varieties
of trees and thousands of flowers. The flowers are changed as
needed--about 21/2 times a year.</LD>
<LD>   "I love it here. I do."</LD>
<TE>   Levi lives in Century City, an exclusive Los Angeles enclave of
high-rise offices, underground parking and an almost invisible
neighborhood of residences.</TE>
<TE>   Four thousand people, in fact, live in the half-square-mile area
on the southwestern edge of Beverly Hills that was built as Los
Angeles' first experiment with mixed-use development.</TE>
<TE>   For 40 years, it has been a bastion of stability. Its condominiums
have been filled with a mix of actors, Hollywood agents and
well-heeled retirees, widows and divorcees. Its offices have bulged
with lawyers and entertainment industry types. Its posh hotels with
business travelers and others looking for luxury without the
appearance of extravagance.</TE>
<TE>   There are movie theaters and restaurants within easy walking
distance. At its heart, the Shubert Theatre fit right in by offering
a diet of tried-and-true Broadway musicals--the type of fare easily
within the comfort zone of those living and visiting nearby.</TE>
<TE>   But the Shubert and the rest of the ABC Entertainment Center are
coming down, and a new office complex is going up. And suddenly, Levi
isn't sure he likes what he's starting to see from his 11th-floor
condominium.</TE>
<TE>   "If they build it like they show in the sketches, it will be awful
for the merchants who will lose their space. To me the answer is not
to build another 15-story office building. I think it will destroy
the ambience," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The $300-million structure planned for Avenue of the Stars will be
an eye-catcher. It will have a 90-by-110-foot hole in the middle of
it that opens onto a plaza. It will replace the 30-year-old Shubert
and the shops, cafes and cinemas that are between the Century Plaza
Hotel and the twin 44-story Century Plaza Towers office buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The project, proposed to start next year, is not the only new
development that residents worry is tipping Century City's scales
from civility to too much commerce.</TE>
<TE>   A 35-floor office tower under construction atop a former parking
lot on Constellation Place on the western edge of Century City will
open next year. MGM will be the primary tenant, occupying more than
half of the 700,000 square feet of what will be called MGM Tower.</TE>
<TE>   Concern Over Traffic, Losing Character</TE>
<TE>   But it is the redevelopment of the Shubert and the rest of the ABC
Entertainment Center properties that has locals worried about losing
neighborhood character and convenience--and about choking on new
traffic congestion.</TE>
<TE>   There was head-scratching at a Century City Chamber of Commerce
meeting when development planners displayed a scale-model of the
proposed building with its open-air "window."</TE>
<TE>   "Where are we going to eat?" asked law office employee Kathryn
Gepner, pointing out that a collection of fast-food outlets and other
small restaurants and cafes that cater to many of Century City's
40,000 workers will disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Project planners said details of a new tenant mix have yet to be
worked out. But they promised that initial plans call for a major
restaurant as well as "cultural amenities" that will replace the
Shubert.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that losing the Shubert should be mitigated," said Dan
Niemann, an executive with Trammell Crow, the Texas-based real estate
company spearheading the new construction plan and operating the
property for J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., which bought it in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Niemann suggested that the building's unusual hole-in-the-center
design will help tame the ocean breeze that sweeps over the Century
Plaza Hotel, hits the 35th floor of the twin towers and then forms a
windy swirl around the courtyard between the structures.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's exactly what's needed" to compensate for "the more
aging assets here in Century City," he said of the proposed building.</TE>
<TE>   The worries of Century City residents and workers and of
homeowners in the nearby Cheviot Hills area were quickly noted at Los
Angeles City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss, who was elected last fall to represent the
Westside neighborhoods, asked that the city require a full
environmental impact report for the project. Trammell Crow wanted the
project to qualify for a so-called mitigated negative declaration and
avoid the complicated and costly report.</TE>
<TE>   "The trick is maintaining a balance in Century City," said Weiss.
"On one hand, we have a commercial center that has no competition in
attracting top-flight law firms, and on the other hand, making sure
that doesn't overwhelm existing neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Although the neighborhood is touted as Los Angeles' premier
example of a master-planned commercial-residential setting, it really
isn't, according to Weiss.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't really call it 'mixed use.' The two uses are really not
co-located. It hasn't been designed in a pedestrian-friendly way.
It's a walking area for people in office buildings to get a bite to
eat at lunch. But it's empty at nighttime."</TE>
<TE>   Its sidewalks are vacant most hours of the day, even though
residents and workers alike say they feel safe as pedestrians.
Authorities say there is minimal street crime because on-street
parking is banned in Century City, and thieves are not inclined to
pay $15 to park in subterranean lots just so they can snatch purses.</TE>
<TE>   Planners Envisioned Busy Walkways</TE>
<TE>   Ghostly walkways are not what city planners envisioned in the
1950s, when an urban development philosophy called the "centers plan"
was taking hold at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Residential apartment units would be constructed near concentrated
high-rise office buildings and connected by green space and walkways.
"Commuting" to work would be as simple as strolling from your front
door to your office door, officials speculated.</TE>
<TE>   Century City, carved starting in 1959 out of a 176-acre chunk of
20th Century Fox's western movie set lot, was Los Angeles' first
"centers plan" experiment. The second was Warner Center--created from
the remnants of movie mogul Harry Warner's real horse ranch in
Woodland Hills in the western San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The Aluminum Co. of America, or Alcoa, was Century City's initial
developer. The striking skyscrapers were clad, naturally, in
aluminum. They created a sleekly urbane business environment. The
open-air 140-store Century City Shopping Center was also built on the
northwestern edge and remains vibrant after its own face-lifts.</TE>
<TE>   Although a proposed freeway link to other parts of Los Angeles was
never built and not a single courthouse is located there, about 5,000
lawyers set up shop in the orderly office towers. The area became
popular with entertainment industry tenants too. These days, Century
City's 22 office buildings are 88% occupied, compared with an 84%
occupancy rate for the greater Los Angeles area, according to real
estate experts.</TE>
<TE>   Housing followed, as did the 1,072-room Century Plaza Hotel, which
for decades was the community's centerpiece. It was the setting for
conventions and was used almost nightly for citywide charity events.
Kings and presidents from Richard Nixon on stayed there. Ronald
Reagan liked the place so much that he took office space in the
nearby Fox Tower (known as the "Die Hard" movie building) after his
presidency ended.</TE>
<TE>   Century City's 4,000 residents are scattered in six carefully
guarded residential compounds. Demographic studies characterize the
residents as success stories: The median household income in 1997 was
$70,484, even though 33% of residents never attended college. In
comparison, nearby Westwood registered a $50,653 median household
income, while only 18% had not attended college.</TE>
<TE>   Three out of four Century City residents, like John Levi, own
their condominium units.</TE>
<TE>   Levi, 71, has lived there since 1976. He was a Beverly Hills
financial planner who was getting a divorce and was familiar with
Century City because his mother lived there when he purchased his
second-floor one-bedroom Century Towers unit for $55,000. Nine years
ago, he sold it for $170,000 and moved to a larger unit on the 11th
floor.</TE>
<TE>   Developers Worked With Residents</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Levi says, developers such as those next door at 20th
Century Fox studios have carefully worked with residents to minimize
inconveniences when new construction took place in Century City. He
worries, though, that certain qualities could be slipping. Levi says
unsightly signs and logos never appeared on buildings; now they're
starting to pop up.</TE>
<TE>   Its residential areas are still well-maintained, however. Over the
years, Levi's neighbors have included actors Burt Lancaster, Michael
Douglas and Sean Connery, as well as singer Karen Carpenter.</TE>
<TE>   Levi says he is one of the few people who walk in Century City. He
strolls half an hour daily, often to the other side of Century City,
where his girlfriend, former actress and now casting director Gerrie
Wormser, lives.</TE>
<TE>   She is a transplanted New Yorker who also enjoys walking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of an elegant feeling. A feeling like, 'Well, I really
made something of myself, coming from the Bronx.' But there are
downsides too. We don't have a Central Park here. There isn't really
a park in Century City, which is sad," said Wormser, a widow who has
lived at Century Park East for 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The Shubert made me feel like I was really in New York. Losing
the ABC Center is a big loss."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Wormser is like Levi. Despite the neighborhood's changes,
she has no intention of walking out on Century City.</TE>

<HD>Just Getting There Is More Than Half the Fun</HD>
<DH>A volunteer group that takes students on educational trips
makes using public transit the keystone of its lessons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Tim Adams, the destination is important, but it's the trip that
really matters.</LD>
<LD>   Through TransitPeople, a volunteer organization Adams founded
three years ago, inner-city youth groups travel each weekend to
places ranging from the La Brea Tar Pits to Exposition Park. The
catch: no cars.</LD>
<LD>   For Adams, a former elementary school teacher who doesn't own a
car, the 80 trips he has led don't seem particularly revolutionary.</LD>
<TE>   But many of the students and volunteers who travel with him have
never boarded a bus, and the mere existence of a subway system in Los
Angeles surprises some.</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-grader Christopher Del Real recently went with Adams from
Chris' East L.A. school to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach,
a trek that included a crowded bus, a walk through a neck-craning
batch of skyscrapers downtown and a Blue Line light rail train.</TE>
<TE>   First-time public transit user Christopher and 39 other Rowan
Avenue Elementary School students said the journey was far more fun
than the usual school bus ride, especially the elevated portions of
the rail line.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get high above everything else, it's like you can see
the whole world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After cautions about safety, the children donned white nylon
jerseys with TransitPeople and Adams' cell phone number plastered on
the fronts and backs. He hasn't lost any kids, but just in case.</TE>
<TE>   Some passengers visibly blanched when the dozens of children
climbed aboard the Rapid Bus, and Adams quickly shepherded them to
the back.</TE>
<TE>   The children got a mini-tour of downtown as they walked the
several blocks from the Library Tower bus stop to the Blue Line
station--one girl lagging behind as she waved solemnly to the tallest
skyscrapers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big, big world, but taking public transit makes it small,"
said volunteer Vivian Ejimofor of Long Beach, who met Adams after he
saw her explaining public transit to her 4-year-old daughter on a
Blue Line train. "These trips show kids there's more to life than
their neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   About 30 schools and church groups have participated in
TransitPeople's weekend trips. Starting this month, Adams and another
volunteer will lead Friday afternoon trips to places that are quieter
and less interesting on weekends, such as Los Angeles City Hall and
USC.</TE>
<TE>   "Many kids just don't have that much to do when they're not in
school," Adams said. "That's one of the reasons they get involved in
bad things."</TE>
<TE>   Ten-year-old Alicia Hernandez's weekends normally include watching
TV, playing in the park or visiting neighbors. She said the trip to
the aquarium was much more fun.</TE>
<TE>   "My little brother was so jealous," she said, her hands clutching
the bars on the seat in front of her as the train barreled down the
track. "This is way better than just taking a school bus somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Groups request to go on the trips through TransitPeople's Web
site, www.transitpeople.org. Although the outings were monthly at
first, they have become so popular that they now take place nearly
every weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of like a Battle of the Bulge descending on those
destinations," Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   He first relied on corporate sponsorships to cover fares, but now
the MTA provides the trips free to trip leaders and students.
Corporate sponsorships, or the venues themselves, cover admission to
attractions such as the aquarium.</TE>
<TE>   Adams gives the MTA copies of his itineraries a month in advance,
and the agency notifies bus drivers and rail station officers so they
are prepared for the swarms of kids.</TE>
<TE>   MTA official Rich Morallo, who has observed TransitPeople groups
trekking through Union Station, praised Adams for keeping the
children under control.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically when kids come to Union Station, they run up and down
like it's an amusement park," said Morallo, assistant manager of
public affairs. "Adams runs a tight ship; the kids queue up in
columns and are extremely well-behaved."</TE>
<TE>   He commended Adams' efforts to promote ridership and awareness of
public transit.</TE>
<TE>   "He's giving an opportunity for all families to prove they can
travel to fun locations via public transit," Morallo said. "The kids
go home and tell their parents and hopefully that will encourage
family outings to follow."</TE>
<TE>   Angelica Del Real, Christopher's mother and a Rowan Avenue
Elementary teacher, said the journey showed her how easy it is to
navigate the public transit system. Her fourth-grade daughter,
Hannah, also went along.</TE>
<TE>   "My kids had never been on a bus before, and we were all a little
skeptical," Del Real said. "This proved, 'Hey, we can do this,' plus
it gave me a great opportunity to talk to my kids. We shared things
we never can talk about when I'm driving because I'm too distracted."</TE>
<TE>   The kids were quick to see the advantages of taking public
transit, shouting out "Gas! Parking! Insurance!" when asked what they
were saving money on by taking the bus and train.</TE>
<TE>   "We're teaching children that cars aren't the only way to go,"
said Jill Goularte, a film director's assistant who has volunteered
on about 20 TransitPeople trips. "We're laying the tracks for this
generation to realize there's nothing uncool about using public
transportation."</TE>

<HD>City Allowed Supervisors Illegal Wall</HD>
<DH>Violation: Molina received 10 orders to fix it. Case ended
with the structure unchanged and $3,710 in fines unpaid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina and her husband broke Los
Angeles city building laws at their hillside house for more than a
decade and have not paid nearly $4,000 in resulting fines and fees,
records and interviews show.</LD>
<LD>   The city spared Molina and her husband, Ronald L. Martinez, from
making costly repairs to a retaining wall that did not meet building
and safety codes and was built without a permit in the Mount
Washington district northeast of downtown.</LD>
<LD>   The case lingered for 12 years. It reached top levels of the city
Building and Safety Department and the office of then-City Atty.
James K. Hahn before the department decided last year to let Molina
and Martinez leave the wall in place with no changes.</LD>
<TE>   That decision was made despite more than a dozen verbal warnings
and written notices issued in previous years by city inspectors and
investigators, who contended that the wall--built to create a flat
yard on the hillside lot--was illegal and potentially hazardous.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisor, who was previously a Los Angeles city
councilwoman, and her husband, an affirmative action consultant,
declined to be interviewed for this story.</TE>
<TE>   Some veteran Building and Safety staffers said the city's handling
of the case suggested favoritism.</TE>
<TE>   "If we would make Mom and Pop L.A. tear down the wall, why not Ms.
Molina and Mr. Martinez?" asked Building and Safety inspector Terry
Burgin, who was the city's chief grading inspector assigned to the
case in 1995. "I've seen the department take a hard line and require
demolitions when the danger was comparable," Burgin said.</TE>
<TE>   Building and Safety Department spokesman Robert Steinbach said
Molina and Martinez received no special treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at projects as projects. We don't assign names to them.
Laws are written for everybody to obey," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach said the decision last year to leave the wall alone was
based on a statement that year from a private engineer hired by
Martinez, who said the fact that the 45-foot-long, 10-foot-high wall
had not failed in 10 years proved its strength.</TE>
<TE>   However, the engineer who wrote that report, Fernando Nunez, said
in a 1993 report that the wall was built on loose soil and needed to
be "underpinned" with concrete footings based in bedrock.</TE>
<TE>   Based partly on that report, the city ordered Martinez and Molina
to underpin the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Because it was built on loose soil and not founded on bedrock as
the code requires, inspectors feared that the wall was in danger of
failing.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors also noted that it was beginning to crack.</TE>
<TE>   When contacted by The Times, Nunez, now a private engineer, said
he would review his file on the case to address why he changed his
opinion on the wall. He did not return follow-up phone calls,
however.</TE>
<TE>   Molina and Martinez did not repair the wall after receiving 10
written orders from Building and Safety inspectors from 1993 to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the department sent a 3-inch-thick file of allegations
and evidence for legal action and possible criminal prosecution to
Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   But the city attorney did not pursue the case, and never collected
$3,710 in fines, according to Building and Safety Department records.</TE>
<TE>   They show that Charles Dickerson, a high-level Hahn aide who was a
liaison to the City Council and city departments, handled the case.
In April 1998, Dickerson met with Andrew Adelman, head of the
department, to discuss the case.</TE>
<TE>   Dickerson said he remembers meeting with Adelman and separately
with Martinez, but he cannot recall the substance of those meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Dickerson, a former president of the Board of Public Works, said
it was not unusual for him to meet with the Building and Safety
Department head to discuss problems with a single-family residence.
Department spokesman Steinbach echoed that view.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach said he could not discuss the content of meetings
between his department and the city attorney because of
attorney-client privilege restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   According to Steinbach, Hahn returned the case to Building and
Safety on Feb. 3, 2000, saying there was not sufficient basis to
pursue the case.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach said he could not elaborate on the city attorney's
decision because of attorney-client privilege.</TE>
<TE>   Mary McGuire, a spokeswoman for Hahn's successor, City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo, said she was unable to locate records on the case, which
was concluded during the previous administration.</TE>
<TE>   Though the construction issues at Molina's house were a private
matter, Molina as a public official did not separate herself entirely
from the case.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, while a City Council member, Molina sent a note regarding
the wall to a city inspector on the case.</TE>
<TE>   The handwritten note on city stationery read: "I swear there are
steel bars between the blocks of our retaining wall." Molina said her
husband "asked me to write this note. Let me know if you need
anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Later, when Molina was a county supervisor, one of her staff
members, Sylvia Novoa, met with city officials to discuss the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Novoa, who is now a consultant with a firm that advises
controversial development projects seeking government approval,
responded to an interview request by e-mail: "While I don't remember
specifics, I can tell you that I handled the case regarding the
supervisor's house in the same way I would have handled any
constituent inquiry."</TE>
<TE>   Molina and her husband also were assisted by then-City Councilman
Mike Hernandez, whose district included Mount Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez's deputy, Ed Reyes, called a meeting with three Building
and Safety staffers involved in the case, files show.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes asked for the meeting because Molina's husband believed the
inspector on the case was politically biased against him, documents
indicate.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes, who succeeded Hernandez as the district's councilman, asked
for the inspector to be replaced, the file shows.</TE>
<TE>   Chief investigator Ernest Herrera told Reyes that department
protocol would not allow the inspector to be replaced, but he was
overruled by Walt Krukow, a higher-ranking Building and Safety
official, who agreed at the meeting to replace the inspector.</TE>
<TE>   Krukow, who has retired from the department, was unavailable for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said he remembered the case but said Molina received no
special treatment.</TE>
<TE>   He said that retaining walls are a sensitive issue in his former
hillside district, and that he and his staff often met with
constituents on code issues.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints about inspectors, and requests to replace them, were
also common, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes said he did not recall asking for a switch of investigators,
but said he might have done so. He recalled that in this case,
Molina's husband "claimed they [city inspectors] wanted him as a
trophy--that a bureaucrat wanted a politician's head on a platter."</TE>
<TE>   Reyes said he only wanted to ensure public safety, and that he
wanted to find a way to get the wall reinforced.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was not aware of the 2001 Building and Safety
Department decision to allow the wall to stand without repairs. When
told of the decision, Reyes said if it was based on an engineer's
recommendation, "the engineer is putting his license on the line. The
liability lies there."</TE>

<HD>Shoe Logo on a Park? Lake Forest Says It's a Good Fit</HD>
<DH>Sponsorship: O.C. municipality takes corporate deals to a
new level. Some ask: Is anything sacred?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They're on lifeguard vehicles and towers, vending machines and
beachfront trash cans from Malibu to Point Loma, a nonstop march of
corporate logos.</LD>
<LD>   In San Diego, city leaders are willing to slap a corporate emblem
on a firefighting helicopter if they can find a company willing to
foot the bill for the aircraft and a pilot.</LD>
<LD>   But Lake Forest, a bedroom community in southern Orange County,
has taken corporate deals to a new level by naming a city park after
a shoe company and giving the manufacturer exclusive use of the
public land at certain times.</LD>
<TE>   In exchange for $100,000, Etnies--whose shoes and other clothing
are popular with high school students--will get naming rights to
parkland adjacent to its corporate headquarters and will be permitted
to stage skateboard competitions and film commercials and videos on
the property.</TE>
<TE>   To help defray costs that will fall on the city--the park will
cost nearly $1 million--Etnies T-shirts are being sold on the Lake
Forest Web page and in City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Marcia Rudolph said she is comfortable forging a
partnership with the shoe manufacturer but concedes it begs the
question of how far cities should go in selling rights to things that
belong to the public. Putting a corporate logo on, say, the city's
envisioned senior citizen complex would be too much.</TE>
<TE>   ''That's where I would draw the line,'' Rudolph said.</TE>
<TE>   Others have a different take.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's commercialism gone gaga,'' USC marketing professor Michael
A. Kamins said of the Lake Forest park deal.</TE>
<TE>   The mere suggestion last month of selling naming rights to some of
New York City's gardens and parks brought protests, angry letters to
the editor and an avalanche of e-mails to Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
What next, asked a coalition of community leaders, college professors
and others in an open letter to the mayor. Enron Central Park?</TE>
<TE>   A similar proposal in Atlanta died last year from lack of
community and government support. In Boston, an effort to sell naming
rights to the city's subway tunnels went nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   But in Lake Forest, population 77,182, the naming rights to the
city's newest park were handed over to the shoemaker without a wince.
For at least 20 years, it will be known as Etnies Skatepark of Lake
Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest Mayor's Not Worried About the Sale</TE>
<TE>   ''We're not Atlanta, and we're not New York City,'' Lake Forest
Mayor Richard T. Dixon said. ''This is just a small town where the
private [sector] has decided to donate money to this particular skate
park. We didn't go to Etnies and say, 'Hey, you guys want to buy the
naming rights?'''</TE>
<TE>   Etnies officials aren't worried about a backlash, though the deal
is a first for the company.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were some huge, multibillion-dollar corporation that was
desperately looking for a way to break into Generation X, then there
could have been some backlash," said Piney Kahn, a spokeswoman for
the company.</TE>
<TE>   The parkland is a rugged strip of land near the Foothill
Transportation Corridor and Lake Forest Drive. The city will spend
about $900,000 on the park while Etnies picks up the $100,000 tab for
designing a skateboard facility on the property. Whether standard
park equipment such as swings and slides will be installed at Etnies
Skatepark hasn't been decided.</TE>
<TE>   Although city officials see the deal as a good marriage between
public and private interests, it worries Gary Ruskin, executive
director of the consumer watchdog group Commercial Alert, which was
founded by Ralph Nader in 1988. Ruskin said it smacks of being a
''partial privatization of a public park.''</TE>
<TE>   ''Not everything should be for sale,'' Ruskin said.</TE>
<TE>   Capitalizing on public possessions like parks, beaches and even a
town's image is not new. The Ralphs Grocery Co. paid $100,000 for
naming rights to a skateboard area of San Clemente's Richard T. Steed
Memorial Park, named for a local police officer killed in the line of
duty. Except for a single sign carrying the grocery chain's name, the
company doesn't get any perks, said Steve Mead, San Clemente's
recreation manager.</TE>
<TE>   ''Lake Forest sold out,'' Mead said, chuckling.</TE>
<TE>   Corporations are aware that they're treading on sensitive ground
with naming rights, said Mike Riley, president of Public Enterprise
Group, an Orange County-based marketing firm that handles corporate
sponsorships for Huntington Beach and other cities. What's off limits
in one town might be for sale in another.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're out to win loyalty one customer at a time, one community
at a time, and we work very carefully with each city to be sure we're
tactful in our approach," said Bart Casabona, a spokesman for
PepsiCo, an early player in municipal naming rights. Although it's
not likely any corporation would want to put its name on city hall
right now, there may come a day when the idea isn't so outlandish,
Riley said. ''There is an evolution of taste,'' Riley said. ''Thirty
years ago, I remember how ludicrous I thought the idea was to wear a
clothing label on the outside of my shirt. You see it all the time
now.''</TE>
<TE>   Knowing what price to put on a city's assets isn't always easy to
figure. Some cities hire consultants like Riley or Ted Cox, who is
helping swing a deal for selling naming rights to a high school
football stadium in Midland, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego created a department in City Hall to identify
sponsorship opportunities and nurture existing ones.</TE>
<TE>   Cox's firm, the Cleveland-based Superlative Group, recently
finished an inventory of ''assets'' for Miami-Dade County in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   ''We'll identify the most valuable assets and then implement the
sale,'' said Brian Hicks, Superlative Group's manager of municipal
marketing. ''And that could be naming rights to a facility or a
vending contract.''</TE>
<TE>   City Looks for More Sponsors for Park</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest officials have hired a public relations firm, Waters
and Faubel, to find other sponsors to cover construction costs for
the rest of the park. That Etnies isn't picking up the full tab
doesn't bother city leaders. They're just happy to have the Etnies
name attached.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a heck of an attraction," Dixon said. "All the kids know
that name, and that's a real plus."</TE>
<TE>   City officials also hope to see a boost in tourism revenue when
Etnies holds skateboard competitions at the park.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach may follow Lake Forest's lead, said Riley, who is
working on a sponsorship program there. Long Beach is considering
building several skateboard parks and may sell naming rights. Whether
some exclusive use of the property would be offered to a corporate
sponsor hasn't been decided.</TE>
<TE>   USC's Kamins bristles at the thought. ''Product placement has
started to inundate the consumer,'' Kamins said. ''People are already
fed up with the amount of product placement you see in movies.... And
then to have someone impinging upon the community by putting their
logo on a park, it's even more in your face.''</TE>
<TE>   Kamins said cities are better off negotiating deals that will get
them free use of emergency equipment and other, more tangible items.</TE>
<TE>   That's why San Diego officials are optimistic they'll find a
sponsor for a helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's unique, and it's not like we're naming a building after a
sponsor,'' said Mary Braunwarth, San Diego's director of development.</TE>
<TE>   ''And fighting fires with helicopters makes for good TV.''</TE>

<HD>Mission Viejo Priest Removed on 1978 Claim</HD>
<DH>Scandal: St. Kilian parishioners stunned at announcement of
abuse investigation against Father Tom Naughton.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Jesuit priest assigned to a Mission Viejo Catholic church has been
removed temporarily from his duties while church officials
investigate a claim that he molested a child more than two decades
ago in Texas, diocesan officials said late Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Shocked parishioners at St. Kilian Church were notified of Father
Tom Naughton's removal at the end of Mass on Saturday in a brief
announcement by Father James P. Dunning, the parish priest.</LD>
<LD>   Dunning told parishioners that Naughton had been accused of sexual
misconduct in 1978, a parishioner said. Dunning could not be reached
for comment Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "There was a stunned silence in the church," said Genevieve Hamm,
a 20-year member of the church, who attended the Mass. Naughton, 68,
is the third Orange County priest removed from his duties in recent
months amid a nationwide sex-abuse scandal that has swept the Roman
Catholic Church, leading to the dismissals of priests, the launching
of criminal investigations and, in Boston, calls for the resignation
of Cardinal Bernard F. Law.</TE>
<TE>   Diocese of Orange officials said they were told of the allegation
against Naughton by his superiors in the Society of Jesus, also known
as the Jesuits, on April 5. The order is investigating the claim.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Naughton agreed to go on administrative leave in
accordance with diocesan policy on dealing with sex-abuse allegations
against priests, said diocesan spokeswoman Maria Schinderle.</TE>
<TE>   Schinderle said she had not spoken with Naughton and did not know
whether he denied the allegation or whether law enforcement officials
had been notified about the claim. Naughton could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   St. Kilian is one of three parishes served by Serra Catholic
Elementary School in Rancho Santa Margarita, but there was no
immediate indication that Naughton's duties involved the school.</TE>
<TE>   Jesuits make up the largest religious order within the Catholic
Church, with more than 21,000 members serving 112 nations. In the Bay
Area, four Jesuits have been named as defendants in a Santa Clara
County civil lawsuit alleging they sexually abused two mentally
retarded men at Sacred Heart, a retreat overlooking the Santa Clara
Valley. A criminal investigation also is underway.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting Priest Was a Fixture at St. Kilian</TE>
<TE>   Though a visiting priest at St. Kilian, Naughton was a regular
fixture for years, saying morning Mass on weekdays and impressing
parishioners with anecdotes about saints on their feast days.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very dedicated, very knowledgeable," said parishioner Tom
Brown, who recalled Naughton's compassion during the funeral last
year for Brown's wife.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really going to shake up the whole parish," Brown said. "The
man was such a strong, caring guy. It just doesn't make any sense to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Father Michael Pecharich was asked to leave his
12-year position at San Francisco Solano Church in Rancho Santa
Margarita after he admitted molesting a teenage boy 19 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the diocese paid $5.2million to settle molestation
charges brought by one alleged victim against Msgr. Michael Harris, a
popular principal at Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho
Santa Margarita. The diocese has asked Vatican officials to remove
Harris from the priesthood as part of the settlement and agreed,
along with the diocese of Los Angeles, to fire any priests with a
history of child molestation.</TE>
<TE>   In September, John Lenihan was removed as pastor of St. Edward
Church in Dana Point after he, under the pseudonym "Father X,"
revealed to a Los Angeles Times columnist that he had had several
sexual relationships. In 1991, Lenihan admitted to church officials
that he sexually abused a teenage girl in the 1970s. The church paid
the victim $25,000 to Mary Grant to settle her lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Recent Settlement Cost Dioceses $1.2 Million</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the dioceses of Los Angeles and Orange paid
$1.2million to a 37-year-old woman who alleged in a lawsuit that
Lenihan i molested her as a teenager, impregnated her and paid for
her abortion.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported in March that six to 12 priests had been
dismissed by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony in February for past sexual
abuse of minors. Mahony, under growing pressure to reveal details
about the cases, has said only that "a few" priests, almost all of
them retired, were involved.</TE>

<HD>Salton Sea Sticking Point in Water Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALTON SEA STATE RECREATION AREA</DL>
<LD>Smelly and discolored, the Salton Sea has long been California's
environmental invalid, cursed by rising salinity and an unstoppable
flow of agricultural pesticides and Mexican sewage.</LD>
<LD>   Still, this contradictory and improbable body of water that
straddles Imperial and Riverside counties supports an enormous
population of fish and millions of migratory birds.</LD>
<LD>   For decades water planners have warned that the sea--which was
created by accident nearly a hundred years ago--is dying and will
someday be too salty for fish to survive. Those warnings have gone
largely unheeded.</LD>
<TE>   Now, unless a plan is devised in a few months to protect fish and
birds in the sickly sea, a water transfer that is crucial to
California's future supply may be in peril.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is wildlife the only concern. Officials in downwind areas are
concerned about the health hazards posed by the possibility of toxic
dust storms like those that blow off Owens Lake if the Salton Sea is
allowed to shrink and acres of salty, chemical-laced sea bottom
become exposed to the desert winds.</TE>
<TE>   The sea is suddenly center stage in California's water
planning--and politicking--because of a proposed deal for water-rich
farmers in the Imperial Valley to sell water to arid San Diego
County. The San Diego-Imperial Valley deal would be the largest
transfer of water from agricultural to urban users in the nation's
history.</TE>
<TE>   The sea is dependent on agricultural runoff for replenishment, and
any reduction of water use by farmers could cause the sea to become
smaller and saltier.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and state endangered species laws require water agencies
involved in selling and buying water to offset any negative impact
caused by such sales. With people concerned about toxic dust storms,
and invoking the federal Clean Air Act, the chances of litigation
over the Salton Sea are considerable.</TE>
<TE>   If the Imperial Valley-San Diego water deal falls apart for
failure to find a solution for the Salton Sea, the effect could be
felt throughout Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The water deal is key to an overall plan to reduce the state's
reliance on the Colorado River. If other states dependent on the
river are not convinced that California is serious about cutting
back, they could demand that the federal government reduce
California's take from the river.</TE>
<TE>   "One piece falls and the whole thing fails," said Bob Campbell, a
Salton Sea specialist with the San Diego County Water Authority.
"That's the rock and the hard spot we're between."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that there is no consensus on how to fix the Salton
Sea or how to pay for it. Worse yet, there are studies that predict
that even a rescue plan costing hundreds of millions of dollars will
only delay the sea's demise from extreme salinity.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a Dec. 31 deadline for addressing the sea's
environmental problems looms, and other Colorado River states are
eagerly waiting to see if California can live up to its promise to
reduce its draw from the Colorado--after years of taking more than
its legal limit.</TE>
<TE>   If the state cannot meet the December deadline, other Colorado
River states could insist that the Department of the Interior prevent
California from taking water that belongs to them.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett Raley, assistant Interior secretary for water and science,
warned in a recent speech that the federal government would have no
choice but to order a mandatory cutback if California does not
voluntarily reduce its dependence on the Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   The other states have agreed to give California 15 more years of
receiving "surplus" water but only if, among other things, the Dec.
31 deadline is met.</TE>
<TE>   Raley said the overall California water plan is in danger of being
"held hostage to the larger issues presented by the Salton Sea."</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to save the water transfer deal, Rep. Duncan Hunter
(R-El Cajon) introduced a bill that would have lifted the Dec. 31
deadline, provided $60 million for save-the-sea programs, and limited
the ability of environmentalists to file lawsuits claiming the water
transfer would harm the sea's wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The water agencies involved in the deal, including the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which serves 16
million people in six counties, endorsed the Hunter bill.</TE>
<TE>   But it was soon bottled up in committee, amid opposition from
environmentalists, Democrats and Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs), who
represents the sea's northern edge.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many people who believe it's not going to be feasible
to save the sea," said MWD Chief Executive Ronald Gastelum. "But
until a document [like a Bureau of Reclamation study] or a decision
point forces people to come to terms with those realities, we're just
going to swim in the same very salty water."</TE>
<TE>   Said Joseph Sax, a former advisor to the Interior Department under
President Clinton and a law professor at UC Berkeley: "The problem of
the Salton Sea has turned out to be far greater than anybody
thought."</TE>
<TE>   As he walked along the water's edge, crunching the tiny fish bones
and barnacles that line the shore like a bathtub ring, Tom Kirk,
executive director of the Salton Sea Authority, expressed his
ambivalence toward this freakish body of water that he is determined
to save.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult place to love at first," Kirk said. "It's an
irony inside a paradox, all wrapped up in a conundrum."</TE>
<TE>   It is also a place that was never supposed to be. For centuries it
was just a salt sink, left from a prehistoric lake.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1905 the Colorado River jumped its banks near Yuma,
Ariz.--the product of an ill-conceived attempt at taming the river
for desert agriculture--and flowed northward for nearly two years.</TE>
<TE>   Because the sink is below sea level, the river's flow
reestablished the sea. With the flow ended, the sea's only
replenishment is from three streams with contamination problems: the
Alamo and Whitewater rivers, which carry pesticides from agricultural
spraying, and the infamous New River, carrying untreated sewage and
other pollutants from Mexicali, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   For any other body of water, stopping or reducing flows from
rivers like those would be a boon. For the Salton Sea, it could be
the death knell.</TE>
<TE>   As troublesome as agricultural runoff is as a source of
replenishment, it is better than no runoff at all. Without
replenishment, the sea would shrivel and the salt level would
skyrocket, killing the fish and scaring away the birds.</TE>
<TE>   Because the sea depends on agricultural runoff, its size has
fluctuated with annual changes in the level of planting and
irrigation. The shifting level has led to flooding of waterfront
businesses, bankruptcies and lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The sea is ringed with motels, marinas, grocery stores, and
condominium projects that went bust waiting for the area to regain
the popularity it enjoyed before the state began warning about health
dangers linked to eating fish from the water.</TE>
<TE>   The Salton Sea may be the only place in California where
waterfront property is declining in value. A local joke holds that
someone who sells property at only a 10% loss after 10 years is
considered to have made a profit.</TE>
<TE>   The salinity level has led to a profusion of algae--which gives
the sea its distinctive brown color and rotten-egg smell--and
occasional massive die-offs of fish. There have also been die-offs of
birds. So far, scientists haven't been able to agree on the cause.</TE>
<TE>   The sea is 35 miles long, 15 miles wide and up to 50 feet deep. It
is 25% saltier than the Pacific Ocean. Fishing is good year round.
Water-skiers love the glassy surface, and winter visitors enjoy
baking in the desert sun and gazing at the Chocolate and Santa Rosa
mountains in the background.</TE>
<TE>   One estimate is that the Imperial Valley-San Diego deal--because
it will mean less water used on crops and thus less runoff--will
shrink the sea's "footprint" by a third.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at a smaller and stinkier sea," Kirk said.</TE>
<TE>   David Hogan, a biologist with the Center for Biological Diversity,
based in Tucson and Idyllwild, accused federal environmental agencies
of "abdicating their responsibility to protect our environment" by
not blocking the water deal. "They got rolled," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Salton Sea Authority--run jointly by Riverside and Imperial
counties, the Imperial Irrigation District and the Coachella Valley
Water District--has stopped short of opposing the water deal but has
warned repeatedly about air pollution and fish depletion.</TE>
<TE>   For residents of an area already suffering from some of the
state's dirtiest air, the specter of dust storms from a newly exposed
Salton Sea bottom is infuriating.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Bono has protested that water officials seem willing to
sacrifice the health of the nearby Coachella Valley to ensure that
the water deal is approved. She and others worry that the Salton Sea
could produce the kind of dust storms linked to the shrunken Owens
Lake in the eastern Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Salton Sea were in the frontyards of Los Angeles, San
Diego and Orange counties, the current [San Diego-Imperial] proposal
would be off the table," said Palm Desert Councilman Buford Crites.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no consensus about the Salton Sea, there is no
lack of activity. Reports and recommendations are being prepared by
the Salton Sea Authority and the Bureau of Reclamation. Bono hopes to
organize a Salton Sea task force in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "My fear is that we don't have time [before the Dec. 31
deadline]," Bono said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating that we're going to be playing catch-up, but
it's the best we can do."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Imperial Irrigation District, which is entitled
to 75% of California's share of the Colorado River, are concerned
that environmentalists and politicians will try to force the district
into paying most of the cost of protecting the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   There is even talk among farmers and others of scuttling the San
Diego deal, which would scramble years of California water planning.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the [deal] looks now, I can't support it," said Stella
Mendoza, president of the district's board of directors. "I can't see
ruining the economic health of Imperial Valley so we can send water
to the coast."</TE>

<LD>Peter Biehl's accomplishments during the past decade would have made
his daughter Amy proud. The one-time Orange County resident astounded
many people and infuriated others by forgiving and eventually
embracing four South African men who stoned, stabbed and beat his
daughter to death.</LD>
<LD>   Biehl, who died recently at age 59 from complications associated
with colon cancer, gracefully managed his unlikely transformation
from food-marketing executive to an international symbol of the power
of forgiveness. He also seemed able to balance the desire to serve
his daughter's legacy against the needs of remaining family members.
Proof that he succeeded was evident in daughter Kim's recent
description of her father as an "awesome" person.</LD>
<LD>   Linda, Biehl's childhood sweetheart and wife of 38 years, said
that Amy's death "brought out who he truly was." His evolution meant
trading easy weekends in Palm Springs for long weeks spent in some of
South Africa's poorest neighborhoods. The family established a
foundation to try to catch youths before they fell into the hopeless
spiral that led to his daughter's murder in 1993.</LD>
<TE>   Biehl often spoke to religious groups about his journey. His
message provided a thought-provoking contrast to the line of aching
family members who understandably demand justice in the name of their
murdered loved ones. Biehl, who talked ceaselessly of forgiveness,
spent his final years trying to change the social conditions that
produced the four men found guilty of murdering his child. The
foundation eventually hired two of Amy Biehl's killers.</TE>
<TE>   Biehl's highly publicized act of forgiveness upset some people. An
irate Southern Californian castigated Biehl's embracing of the men
who murdered his daughter as "hideous" because it seemed to offer an
excuse for murder. Another found Biehl's reasoning "as reprehensible

that honorary family with grace and honor.</TE>

<LD>With an important deadline for the former El Toro base on the
calendar this month, it seems that everything but the kitchen sink is
getting thrown into the mix of possible uses for the facility.</LD>
<LD>   At times like this, when it feels almost as if the community is
starting all over, it's important to remember how much debate has
gone before. And most important, the recent countywide ballot
initiative, in which a park plan won out over an airport, showed a
preference at the end of years of debate for a particular type of
redevelopment plan. It at least should have a chance to be evaluated
properly before vanishing in the face of some new idea.</LD>
<TE>   But nothing is ever simple at El Toro. The Navy opened the door to
a new era of complexity by saying hours after the passage of Measure
W last month that it would begin a sale of the base. Suddenly, the
development of a large park, or at least one like that envisioned by
Measure W proponents, was not so certain. Like it or not, the park
idea always has been more serious than critics contend, the product
at least in concept of a long process of grass-roots community
planning spearheaded by the city of Irvine. What should happen now is
that the concept be vetted more fully than it was during a political
campaign. As much as the initiative was portrayed as nothing more
than a way to shoot down the airport, there was no mistaking its
intended alternative, at least in general terms. That was that El
Toro eventually be developed as a park, with its attendant
educational and cultural trappings.</TE>
<TE>   The question is, will that park idea get a fair chance to be
studied and implemented? It may end up costing a bundle, and parts of
it may be unrealistic, but it certainly deserves at least a full
hearing, just as the airport had its day.</TE>
<TE>   But with April 23 looming, the prospect of a sale stirred a lot of
discussion about a fresh interest from developers. The Navy aspires
to honor the intent of Measure W, but who knows what will happen if
property is transferred out of the federal government's hands? A sale
would make things more complicated, especially for a Local
Redevelopment Authority that already has been strongly criticized as
unrepresentative.</TE>
<TE>   Just whose vision should be implemented, and by whom? The answer
under federal base reuse guidelines is the community. But this is
more complicated than ever. The good-old days of the 1990s seem
almost comforting by comparison. Then at least there was a clear
battle line and one galvanizing idea, the proposal for an
international airport.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Mayor Larry Agran is one who has stayed with his vision for
the implementation over time of the "Great Park" proposal. But prime
real estate in the center of Orange County is getting people thinking
and talking again, especially when it now appears headed for the
auction block.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain: Any commercial alternatives to park
development will be daunting. Just for starters, the need for yet
more rezoning approval would arise for anyone trying to break faith
with or seriously modify the intent of Measure W. This would be
followed by some arduous planning hurdles and a host of environmental
cleanup questions.</TE>
<TE>   And then there are other possibilities more far afield for El
Toro. Recently the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians said it was
considering a casino, or even outlet stores and a power plant. The
tribe has sought recognition by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which
could bolster a claim for federal property.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later, the El Toro debate always comes back to community
consensus, and orderly local planning and control. In New York, the
federal government and the city of New York have recently learned a
similar lesson the hard way. They have been trying to figure out what
to do with Governors Island, after a dispute between the state and
city dating to 1996. Because the locals couldn't agree on how to use
the property, New York lost a chance to buy the island for $1.</TE>
<TE>   Consensus really matters in the reuse of federal land, whoever
gets the prize. It's why local interested parties need to line up
with a unified Local Redevelopment Authority, and work with Irvine to
implement a vision that somehow squares with Measure W's intent.</TE>

<LD>Luck plays an obvious role in streaks. The baseball takes a funny
bounce, evades a shortstop's outstretched glove and rolls safely into
the outfield. So, yes, luck is evident in Huntington Beach, a city
that had been averaging more than five murders annually during the
past decade.</LD>
<LD>   The last murder entry on the police blotter is dated Nov. 27,
1999, as The Times recently reported. There's no telling when that
serendipitous streak might end. Surf City certainly has continued to
have its share of violent incidents, but none of the victims has
died.</LD>
<LD>   Fortune isn't the main force responsible for Huntington Beach's
welcome break in the deadly action. Local politicians rightfully
credit improved policing, including policies that seem to be reducing
gang violence, which has ignited some of the city's deadly
confrontations. Law enforcement is quick to shift the spotlight onto
paramedics and the UCI Medical Center's Level One trauma center.</LD>
<TE>   Medical advances and sheer determination have kept many victims at
death's door from crossing over. Trauma center surgeons, nurses and
technicians are alerted by incoming paramedics. Hospital teams can't
help every victim rolled into the unit on a gurney, but they are
better equipped to stabilize victims and quickly move them into
surgery. "They work some miracles," a veteran police officer said.</TE>
<TE>   One deadly incident last year shattered Huntington Beach's grace
period. Police shot and killed an 18-year-old man who was holding a
toy gun. Prosecutors ruled the shooting to be justified. Apart from
that tragedy, the relative calm echoes an era in which Huntington
Beach was a small, quiet town. Police logs show several lengthy
murder-free periods during the 1940s, '50s and early '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's a newfound sense of civility, simple luck or, most
likely, the combined efforts of safety and medical personnel, the
absence of murders helped to push Huntington Beach's violent crime
rate down by 0.3% during 2001. The city's good fortune is all the
more apparent because the statewide murder rate rose 9.2% during
2001. What's more, crime rates in Orange County's major cities rose
at higher rates than in the rest of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials can't explain why the murder rate in one
jurisdiction drops noticeably while rising elsewhere. The unexpected
calm also drives a more practical benefit: In addition to catching up
on other crimes, the city's detectives have more time to research
leads into 20 unsolved murders. But the advances in community
policing and emergency response at least encourage the notion that
the city is doing some things right. And, if luck plays a supporting
role, so be it.</TE>

<LD>Re "End the Tustin Base Dispute," Editorial, March 31:</LD>
<LD>   Your editorial made some excellent points. Valuable time and money
have been spent and wasted as this dispute drags on. Attorney fees
and time spent by the Santa Ana Unified School District personnel on
trying to get clean land for schools will be seen as well spent once
this situation is settled.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana Unified needs the good, clean land on the base.
Prevention is better than demolition. The moral and fiduciary
responsibility the district board has to its residents and students
is to assure to the best of their knowledge that schools and
playgrounds are safe.</LD>
<TE>   Tustin has generously given land to other school districts and
also the Rancho Santiago and South County community college
districts. Yet the city can't seem to find 100 clean acres for Santa
Ana Unified.</TE>
<TE>   There really is a win-win situation here. Tustin can change some
of its plans and build its shopping malls on questionable clean land
and give Santa Ana Unified clean land for schools.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County public schools, which have the second-highest
enrollment in the state, are being hijacked by the federal government
at a cost in excess of $89 million annually. And the figure is
increasing daily.</LD>
<LD>   But we are not alone. Almost 6 million students statewide are
losing more than $1 trillion annually to the same culprit, despite
concerted efforts by local school boards and the Orange County
Department of Education to stop the bleeding that began in 1975.</LD>
<LD>   People with disabilities need and deserve an education at public
expense. That principle was accepted and adopted by Congress when the
Education for All Handicapped Children Act, now the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act, passed almost 30 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Recognizing that educating disabled children ages 3 through 21
could be very expensive, Congress included the provision for the
federal government to finance 40% of the cost. That generous
commitment has never materialized; the high mark was 17%, and average
funding has been closer to 11%.</TE>
<TE>   So who makes up the $89-million shortfall in Orange County? The
short answer: every public school student.</TE>
<TE>   No one denies that children with special needs will be better
served when they are educated. But Congress' refusal to accept its
responsibility is denying 90% of our students the privilege of
smaller classes, the joys of art and music, field trips, Advanced
Placement classes and other special experiences that make school
years so memorable.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County schools are good. Despite the economic climate and
inadequate budgets, students, teachers, counselors and administrators
are performing among the best anywhere, according to statewide and
nationwide test results. Our communities responded to crucial
building needs in the March election. We will have the classrooms; we
must have the support.</TE>
<TE>   We are committed to world-class education, but we cannot do that
with broken promises. We need our elected representatives to call on
their colleagues to stand and deliver, before it's too late.</TE>

<LD>Re "Meet the 1st Amendment," Editorial, March 31:</LD>
<LD>   I wish to commend The Times for urging the board of trustees of
the South Orange County Community College District to return to some
level of law-abiding sensibility. The board majority and its puppet
administration have sullied the names of the district's two colleges
quite long enough and embarrassed California's community colleges by
their erratic and unprofessional antics.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the Chronicle of Higher Education, this group is known
far beyond this state for its assaults on free speech, its
anti-intellectual, anti-student, and anti-faculty actions, and for
the cronyism that marks its tenure.</LD>
<TE>   In November, some of the trustees will be up for reelection. Until
the board majority and its minions are replaced with competent people
who know and respect the law, the district will continue to suffer,
its students will continue to flee to other districts, and the
exceptional faculty and the few decent administrators still present
will retire early, teach elsewhere or find other employment.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you again for speaking on our behalf. Our voices are tired
and hoarse, our spirit often deflated. Your attention rallied our
sagging morale, and we are grateful.</TE>

<HD>County Agency Is Urged to Drop Sewage Waiver</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A Sewage Plume Comeback?," April 4:</LD>
<LD>   Your article presents one more piece of research supporting the
need for a minimum of full secondary treatment of sewage discharged
off the coast by the Orange County Sanitation District. The study
referenced in the article indicates a mechanism by which the sewage
plume can reach the shore, as did a 1997 study commissioned by the
district.</LD>
<LD>   In February, the plume came within half a mile of Newport Beach,
according to the sanitation district; on March 14, beach postings
were made from the Santa Ana River mouth to the Wedge in Newport
Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, many district board members, including Yorba Linda
Councilman John M. Gullixson, will wait for that one more piece of
science, just like apologists for big tobacco wanted to wait for that
one more piece of evidence linking smoking to cancer. How much more
science will it take for the sanitation district directors to do the
prudent thing and direct the staff to move to full secondary
treatment of all sewage before dumping it into the ocean?</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Baker</TE>
<TE>   Corona del Mar</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The evidence is growing that partially treated sewage released 4.5
miles offshore is spending too many days at the beach.
Environmentalists have long claimed that the sewage plume was
contaminating Orange County's shoreline, causing danger for swimmers
and surfers and prompting frequent beach closures.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sanitation District has denied this scenario,
insisting that released sewage was not contributing to the problem
and that concerned citizens were overreacting because effluent had no
possible way to reach the shoreline.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, however, the district did admit that the sewage had, in
fact, come as close as a half a mile to shore. The new UCI study
gives credence to the possibility that this filth could "ride the
waves" even nearer on a surfboard of cold, beach-bound water. Care
for a moonlight swim, sanitation district?</TE>
<TE>   Linda Nicholes</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sanitation District needs to do the right thing
and get rid of the waiver. The study released shows how the plume
formed by the discharge of 240 million gallons a day of sewage that
is not treated to the specifications called for by the Clean Water
Act could have come back to shore in 1999. The federal Clean Water
Act calls for full secondary treatment of sewage. The district's
waiver allows it to dump sewage not receiving full secondary
treatment into the ocean 4.5 miles offshore at a depth of 200 feet.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 11, a sewage plume was discovered half a mile off Newport
Beach at a depth of 40 feet. The various things the district has
proposed as substitutes for full secondary treatment require a
waiver. The district admits it will take five to seven years to
achieve full secondary treatment.</TE>

<LD>Re "El Toro's Future," March 9:</LD>
<LD>   Barbara Lichman of the Airport Working Group has already decided
to sue to get Measure W thrown out by the courts. She has indicated
that it is unconstitutional for the public to vote on land-use
issues. Wouldn't this then mean that Measure A, which zoned El Toro
as an airport in 1994, also would be unconstitutional?</LD>
<LD>   Someone please tell Lichman that the people have spoken, and that
they do not want an airport. The Navy can sell the property off in
parcels to the highest bidder and the county can get on to the more
pressing issues: education, housing and health care. It is time to
put the attorneys away and do what is best for Orange County, not the
Airport Working Group.</LD>

<LD>Re "Economy Will Affect Capistrano Teachers," Letters, March 31:</LD>
<LD>   Supt. James A. Fleming's comments on negotiations between the
Capistrano Unified School District and the Capistrano Unified
Education Assn. left out three significant facts.</LD>
<LD>   First, teachers received a 10% salary increase last year, not 13%.
Next, Fleming said teachers receive an automatic yearly raise. During
the past 20 years, I've had only three automatic raises, the last
coming nine years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The district finished the school year with $10 million in
reserves, double what the state requires, and has received an
additional 4% this year. Capistrano has a decade-long history of
being one of the last districts to settle in the county. This year,
it's the same old story.</TE>

<HD>Ordinance Proposed to Limit Slate Mailers</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Slate Mailers Need Scrutiny," Editorial, March 31:</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for spotlighting the legal loophole that allows
unlimited contributions to campaign slate mailers.</LD>
<LD>   This is not news to Irvine, where we have strict, voter-mandated
campaign-contribution limits. In our last election, some Irvine
candidates faced an uphill battle against an onslaught of more than a
dozen mailers sent by Hometown Voter Guide.</LD>
<TE>   This project reported spending more than $200,000 that apparently
was not subject to contribution limits. As The Times says, it is
difficult to determine whether a candidate "received what is
tantamount to an unreported campaign contribution." Further, The
Times correctly concludes that "regulators will be hard-pressed to
determine whether candidates are skirting donation limits by
encouraging cash-flush supporters to make donations to friendly
mailers."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, it is clear that donations that are 20 to 30 times
larger than the Irvine limits violate the intent of Irvine voters.
Therefore, I have asked the city attorney to prepare an ordinance to
plug this loophole in our election laws.</TE>
<TE>   The voters rightly expect and deserve to know that the limits they
voted into law are respected.</TE>

<LD>Re "Public to Open Irvine Co. Gift Today," April 6:</LD>
<LD>   As someone who was fortunate enough to grow up and work on the
Irvine Ranch, I can appreciate the precious gift bestowed upon the
public. My father, who worked on the Irvine Ranch for over 30 years,
showed me the special places, including the northern area.</LD>
<LD>   I've been blessed with the wonderful memories of riding on the old
roads and trails with my father in his Irvine Co. pickup, seeing a
bobcat chasing a rabbit in Weir Canyon (you should have seen the look
the bobcat gave us when he lost the rabbit), a red-tailed hawk taking
flight with a 4-foot snake in its talons, and playful skunks chasing
each other under a 600-year-old oak tree.</LD>
<TE>   We saw herds of deer grazing like cattle at sunset in Blind
Canyon, foxes running for cover under the sage at the top of Weir
Canyon, and a mountain lion or two on one of the many rock
outcroppings. One day while we were driving along the wash at the
bottom of Fremont Canyon, we stopped and had lunch and just listened
to nature. No talking, just listening. No noise of the surrounding
communities can be herd at the bottom of that canyon.</TE>
<TE>   There was another time when we had stopped at a cattle gate, and
he told me not to get out to open it. I asked why just as I saw a
coiled rattlesnake head for cover. Those times on the ranch with my
father have forever changed me. I am blessed to have experienced them
and I believe the public who are hearty enough to trek there will
experience the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   I know if my father were still alive, he would have been one of
the first to volunteer to give tours. Thank you, Irvine Co.
(especially Monica Florian) and Donald Bren, for such a wonderful
gift, and thank you, Los Angeles Times, for letting the public in on
the secret of this special place.</TE>

<HD>The El Toro Roles of Agran and Correa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Plans for Base Link Mayor, Irvine Co.," March 31:</LD>
<LD>   One of these days, the Los Angeles Times will get around to
writing the full history of the 1993-2002 El Toro battle. When it
does, and if it presents the facts, it will be clear that no one
worked harder or smarter to defeat the county's airport plan and
replace it with a plan for the Orange County Great Park than Irvine
Mayor Larry Agran.</LD>
<LD>   Agran's strategic genius has been known for years. When Irvine
voters returned him to the City Council in 1998, his clear thinking
and practical understanding came again to the forefront. Agran
understood the Great Park plan as a popular, environmentally sound,
open-space plan benefiting all Orange County residents, and, yes, as
a plan the Irvine Co. could live with.</LD>
<TE>   Anyone with an ounce of sense knows that when it comes to major
matters of planning and development, the trick is to reach a
principled accommodation with the Irvine Co.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what Agran achieved in 1988, when he won voter
approval of a historic open-space preservation agreement that
resulted in permanent preservation of thousands of acres of
hillsides, canyons and wildlife habitat.</TE>
<TE>   It should be obvious to all that Agran has worked his magic
again--this time in the fight over El Toro. With this history, what
mystifies me is why The Times has such a limited phone book that
seems to mostly include cynics and Agran haters. Your reporter turned
to former Mayor Christina Shea, whose blind opposition to both Agran
and the Great Park are a matter of public record. The reporter also
turns to Stephan Smith, a onetime disgruntled aide to Agran who long
ago transferred his loyalties to Shea. The Times should know that
people who are playing out personal or political grudges are
generally poor sources for building a solid story that enlightens
readers.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Lunding</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lou Correa (D-Anaheim) tells us he's hoping to provide a mechanism
to find a vision Orange County can agree on. Suddenly, Correa has
discovered that El Toro is an issue that's divided Orange County, and
he wants state legislators to help us reach common ground. Funny that
Correa never felt the need to do this during the previous eight years
when rancor surrounding the three North County supervisors who were
pushing for an airport was so thick you could cut it with a knife.</TE>
<TE>   Why now, I wonder? Was there not enough division in the past? Or
is it because the pro-airport side lost badly on Measure W?</TE>
<TE>   Now, after four elections, years of public debate, two
environmental impact reports and one very illuminating flight
demonstration, the county has reached a conclusion about El Toro--we
don't want an unneeded and environmentally disastrous airport. And we
don't need or want a bunch of state legislators stepping in at this
late date. We've already decided it for ourselves. It's over, and
Correa should move on to other special interests.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Smith</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Of course the Irvine Co. doesn't want to comment on using its
corporate letterhead to raise money for Irvine Mayor Larry Agran and
Councilman Chris Mears. Connect the dots and look at what's in the
city approval process right now--the massive Northern Sphere
development that will dump more traffic in the county than an
airport.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the company's fund-raising role has been made public,
don't laws about donations come into play?</TE>
<TE>   I seem to remember that in Irvine, you can't vote on any item
involving a campaign donor for a year. Don't Agran and Mears have to
abstain from voting on the Northern Sphere development? Wouldn't they
have a conflict of interest?</TE>

<LD>Re "Capistrano to Pursue a Home Depot Deal," April 3:</LD>
<LD>   The first two sentences of your article say it all: "Home Depot
hopes to build a store in San Juan Capistrano, and to some officials
that looks like a windfall: $9 million for the city-owned land that
the company wants, and a sales tax bonanza in the future. But
hundreds of residents say it would be a disaster."</LD>
<LD>   Officials see a bonanza because they plan to spend most of the
money on themselves in the form of an enlarged City Hall, snazzier
furniture, more travel to conferences, more perks of every
description, more city employees, etc. Just witness nearby Mission
Viejo's new, $22-million City Hall, which was supposed to cost a mere
$12 million. Or go look at Irvine's Taj Mahal-like City Hall,
suitable for a city of 750,000.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of residents say it would be a disaster since they know
that very little of the windfall will be spent on services.</TE>
<TE>   Residents say it would be a disaster because they know that Home
Depot will bring crowds and traffic, the very thing that most local
residents moved to San Juan to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Dumhart, a city analyst, tells residents, "You may not
like the taste of it, you may not like the smell of it, but it's good
for you." Correction, it's good for him and other city officials, but
it's not good for residents.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Watershed Event Ahead for Runoff?" April 8:</LD>
<LD>   Orange County is proposing either a joint powers authority (JPA)
or a watershed-by-watershed series of governing bodies to address
contamination of our streams from urban runoff. The continuing farce
of countywide lip service goes on. This is the "same old, same old"
practice of leaving the wheel in the hands of the captain who ran
this ship aground repeatedly for innumerable years.</LD>
<LD>   The degradation of watersheds like Aliso Creek warrants a changing
of the guard. Instead, public advocates and concerned citizens once
again sit at the back of the environmental bus, with the good-old
boys in charge of a plantation-politics atmosphere.</LD>
<TE>   We need 21st century solutions to 20th century problems, including
processes that allow people the dignity of stewardship for their
habitats. Clean Water Now Coalition has challenged this county for
two years to follow successful models found in other regions of
California and the country.</TE>
<TE>   The JPA (or JPAs) being proposed are like lyrics from a 1971 song
("Won't Get Fooled Again") by the Who: "Meet the new boss ... same as
the old boss." Just what everyone wants--another expensive,
do-nothing layer of government that weakens the public's input.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that developers control this county, not the residents
who want a safer recreational environment. Those of us who love where
we live can't stroll off into the fog whistling a happy tune. All we
have is the memory of creeks that once ran with steelhead trout and
were rife with frogs and crawdads. These places of wonder for
children are now condemned to being flood-control drainage ditches.</TE>

<LD>United Cerebral Palsy of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties is hoping
to build 10 apartments in Stanton if it can raise $400,000 to begin
construction in the fall.</LD>
<LD>   The units are among 57 the nonprofit organization wants to
construct around Southern California for disabled people who have
special needs and generally little income.</LD>
<LD>   Although the group has state and federal backing for much of the
$2.2-million project, the financial squeeze demonstrates the
idiosyncrasies of building affordable housing in one of the most
expensive areas in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   "In Orange County, there is not a lot of housing for people with
special needs, for people with low incomes, so anything that gets
built is big news," said Ben Phillips, a developer for the regional
development department at Mercy Housing California in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government rejected Mercy's proposal to build housing
for the disabled in Santa Ana this year, but the nonprofit group will
try again next year, according to Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Cohen, the cerebral palsy group's executive director, said he
believes he ultimately will be able to find the money by tapping
foundations and individual donors.</TE>
<TE>   But he and others said affordable housing, particularly for the
disabled, requires so much persistence and takes so much risk and so
much money, there are few nonprofit organizations that can build even
10 apartments. Orange County's land costs are too high and land
availability is limited, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Building this kind of housing is like making sausage; if you like
it, don't watch it being made," Cohen quipped between phone calls to
raise the extra funds.</TE>
<TE>   "The process does not make sense. Affordable housing is only
affordable to the people who move in."</TE>
<TE>   Even when nonprofit groups can find a location and funding,
housing for residents with special needs is rare in Orange County
because of neighborhood objections, advocates said.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine a city in Orange County where the city council gets
excited about you bringing the mentally ill into town," said Helen
Cameron, executive director of Newport Beach-based Homes Inc., which
hopes to build a $4-million, 30-unit apartment for the mentally ill
in Midway City.</TE>
<TE>   Julia Bidwell, Orange County Housing and Community Development
Department manager of housing, finance and policy, said there are
17,000 affordable units in the county for families of four who earn
about $40,000 or less.</TE>
<TE>   That's about 1% of the housing in Orange County, according to the
2000 census. The disabled and minimum-wage earners make far less than
$40,000 a year, so only a portion of that 1% is available for them.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no official count of how much housing is
available for the disabled, none has been built in at least five
years, county officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Units for [the] extremely low-income have not been built at the
pace we would like," Bidwell said. "There is a large demand."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen's organization has sought to change that in Orange County
and elsewhere in the Southland. United Cerebral Palsy of Los Angeles
and Ventura is building units in Santa Monica, Pasadena, Goleta and
Burbank after receiving grants from the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development.</TE>
<TE>   The Stanton complex in the 10500 block of Knott Avenue will offer
independent-living amenities such as space for wheelchairs and
emergency call boxes. Residents, who live on federal disability
benefits that leave them in the lowest income levels, will be
eligible for federal rent subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   The project began when Cohen's group bought property in Stanton
for $265,000, with no assurances of federal support, they said. As in
the case of all grants offered by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, Cohen had to compete to win an $800,000 grant. HUD uses
a point system to evaluate all applicants and those who have a site
get more points.</TE>
<TE>   Until he got the grant, Cohen was unable to pay for consultants to
determine the project's cost. It finally was determined he was
$400,000 short.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to spend money before you even know if you can really do
the project," Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron, whose organization paid $315,000 for land for 30 units in
Midway City, agreed: "As a tiny nonprofit, we really had to stick our
neck out. We had to come up with $15,000 [as a down payment] to
initiate this process. We didn't know we would get it back. We were
fairly sure."</TE>
<TE>   HUD grant sums are the same for developments around the country,
no matter what the land costs. So in places like Orange County, there
is a disincentive to apply, affordable housing advocates argue.</TE>
<TE>   Aretha Williams, who heads HUD's programs for the disabled
nationally, disagreed. She said no applicant has ever been left
without a grant after making an investment in property. Applicants do
not have to buy property, she added. They can maintain it in escrow
or even apply without a site commitment, even though they will not
get as many points.</TE>
<TE>   HUD officials also said local and county governments should be
asked to "equal it out" when land costs are above the national
average.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said although Stanton officials welcomed the project and
helped it through the stringent city planning process, he was
unsuccessful in winning financial support from the city.</TE>
<TE>   Community Development Director Mark Lloyd said there was never an
official request.</TE>
<TE>   County officials said it is difficult for local governments to
dedicate limited resources to the housing projects. However, they
point to a new county program that lends money to nonprofits to
acquire property for affordable housing projects. That program could
help nonprofits get the points to win HUD grants.</TE>
<TE>   Housing officials said there is greater awareness now about the
limited housing for low-income families and those with special needs,
and that should lead to changes.</TE>
<TE>   "There is very little of this type of housing now, but there are
proposals in, and there are proposals being developed," said Ken
Domer, spokesman for the county's Housing and Community Development.
"We're hopeful that we can see more of this housing in the future."</TE>

<HD>Lake Balboa? Close Enough, Say Residents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ah, Lake Balboa. You can almost see the bougainvillea-lined trail
leading to the shore.</LD>
<LD>   It was just another place in the San Fernando Valley until last
week when it broke off from Van Nuys, becoming the latest
neighborhood to officially be recognized by the city of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Except there is no trail to the shore--because there is no lake.</LD>
<TE>   The boundaries, which were narrowed from an earlier proposal that
included Van Nuys Airport, fall short of encompassing the lake for
which it is named. But Lake Balboa, the neighborhood, does include
Van Nuys Golf Course and Birmingham High School.</TE>
<TE>   The designation, which carries no political power, was the result
of City Councilman Dennis Zine making good on a campaign promise. It
incensed some Van Nuys residents who were left out. But for those
within the two-square-mile neighborhood, it is a fresh start to
creating a new image.</TE>
<TE>   "It's us coming together to combat what we saw as decay with
ever-increasing velocity approaching us from both sides," said Bryan
Brannon, who led a homeowners group seeking the change.</TE>
<TE>   That decay, which has come to define Van Nuys for many, is evident
in graffiti, streetwalkers and shattered glass.</TE>
<TE>   In her book, "A Year in Van Nuys," humorist Sandra Tsing Loh
described homes in the "bravely tattered" community as "perhaps a bit
too gaily painted, every third or fourth bungalow the color of
eye-piercing sorbet--lime green, raspberry cream, banana yellow. "</TE>
<TE>   Lake Balboa enjoys a more peaceful appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the homes are buffered from the busy streets that slice it
into quadrants: Sherman Way, Vanowen Street, Victory Boulevard and
Balboa Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't put up any physical walls, but it gives us a body of
people dedicated to working together in our area to improve community
standards," Brannon said.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the renaming movement, said Lake Balboa resident
Richard Reimer, was a desire to raise property values without having
to move.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that the name has changed, I'm a bit more snobbish when
people ask, 'Where do you live?'" said Reimer, a letter carrier. "If
you tell people you live in Van Nuys, they assume you live in a
beat-up house with a gang next door selling crack, or whatever. At
least now, [potential homebuyers] will look at the property."</TE>
<TE>   But for all of the badmouthing of the old hometown, the Lake
Balboa homes look much like any of the better parts of the remaining
Van Nuys, said Don Schultz, president of the Van Nuys Homeowners
Assn. Entry-level homes in the mid-$200,000 range, more expensive
houses and large apartment complexes can be found on either side of
the border.</TE>
<TE>   "We take this as an insult, because we've been working hard to get
Van Nuys to be the nice, middle-class neighborhood it was," said
Schultz, who lives half a mile east of Lake Balboa. "These little
secession movements portend to be not only elitist but [also]
racist."</TE>
<TE>   Renaming groups have taken chunks of Van Nuys for the last 12
years. A few blocks in southern Van Nuys defected to Sherman Oaks and
Valley Glen broke off. Now this. All told, Van Nuys has shrunk by a
third and lost as many as 20,000 of its estimated 130,000 residents.</TE>

<HD>Beetles Take Big Bite Out of Forest</HD>
<DH>Outdoors: Pines in the San Jacinto Mountains are being
killed off by an unusually severe infestation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SULLIVAN BRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>IDYLLWILD</DL>
<LD>The trouble started as a rust-colored tinge at the top of the pine
trees on Jim Johnson's lot in this village.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, a lifelong resident of the mountain town, knew what would
come next and dreaded it. The discoloration seeped downward as bark
beetles drained the life from the century-old trees.</LD>
<LD>   Since last fall, an army of insects has invaded coulter and
ponderosa and sugar pines in the San Jacinto Mountains. Throughout
the forest, trees have withered and died.</LD>
<TE>   "I've seen real bad [infestations] before, but nothing like what's
happened now," Johnson said. "It looks like a ... war zone in some
places."</TE>
<TE>   Although forestry officials don't know the exact number of trees
affected, they say that in some 5- to 10-acre pine stands more than
80% have succumbed to the beetles' attack.</TE>
<TE>   The town, which trades on its alpine image, has seen some of its
most treasured assets destroyed. Patches of dead trees splotch the
hillsides along California 243, and line the banks of Strawberry
Creek behind the town's main shopping plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Forest Service and the California Department of Forestry
and Fire Protection are removing dead and damaged trees from select
spots around town. But they say that on most land the infestation is
part of the forest cycle and must simply run its course.</TE>
<TE>   The San Jacinto Mountains have long been vulnerable to beetles,
and were declared a "zone of infestation" by the state Board of
Forestry in 1972. Idyllwild's problem mirrors similar infestations
this year in San Bernardino Mountains communities such as Lake
Arrowhead and Big Bear Lake.</TE>
<TE>   "Bark beetles attack and kill stressed trees," said Jon
Regelbrugge, lands and resource officer for the San Bernardino
National Forest. "They always have and always will."</TE>
<TE>   The trees that fall to beetle infestations enrich the forest
floor, and dead trees that remain standing shelter insect-eating
birds such as woodpeckers, which in turn check beetle populations,
said Laura Merrill, an entomologist with the U.S. Forest Service. But
the beetles tip the balance when drought, human development or other
conditions weaken the trees.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense it's natural, and in another sense the extent and
magnitude of what we have going on may not be entirely natural,
because it's affected by things like fire suppression, cities and
towns," Regelbrugge said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the overwhelming factor right now is a four-year
drought. The previous three years yielded less than two-thirds the
average annual rainfall for the area, said Jim Ludy, controller of
the Idyllwild Water District. This year's sparse storms have dropped
just a third of the year-to-date average. Comparing rainfall over the
same period since 1929, "This has been the worst year of all in 70
years," Ludy said.</TE>
<TE>   Though healthy trees can "pitch out" beetles by drowning them in
sap, drought-parched pines are hard-pressed to fend off the insects'
attack.</TE>
<TE>   The main culprit is the western pine beetle, which bores through
the bark and devours the phloem--the moist inner bark that stores and
transports nutrients from leaves to roots. There the insects dig egg
galleries, where larvae hatch, mature and emerge to infest other
trees.</TE>
<TE>   A fungus that follows the beetles deals the trees their fatal
blow. Root disease and parasites such as mistletoe can also weaken
the trees' defenses.</TE>
<TE>   While drought and disease occur naturally, human activity such as
fire suppression, logging and construction can also prime the forest
for beetle infestations.</TE>
<TE>   Historic logging operations around Idyllwild cut vast stands of
trees in the early 20th century, as five sawmills churned out lumber.</TE>
<TE>   On those sites the current generation of pines sprouted shoulder
to shoulder, instead of growing in the sparer, staggered fashion of
an uncut forest, said Kevin Turner, a division chief with the state
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. He is stationed in
Idyllwild to manage the bark beetle infestation.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighting efforts have quenched the small blazes that normally
thin stands, leaving heavy thickets of trees and brush, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too dense," Turner said. "It's exceeded the carrying
capacity." Construction of buildings, campgrounds and roads also
weaken trees by compacting soil and cutting into root systems, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Such an overgrown, overstressed forest forms a fertile feeding
ground for bark beetles, officials say. And the stands of damaged
trees pose a risk of searing fire. A normal wild-land fire consumes
dried vegetation and thins the forest, but a blaze of beetle-killed
trees may immolate it.</TE>
<TE>   Flames sweeping through dried treetops can burn with extraordinary
heat and intensity, scalding the soil and incinerating healthy trees
along with dead ones, Regelbrugge said.</TE>
<TE>   To reduce the risk that such a fire could damage homes and
property, the U.S. Forest Service decided to clear a stand of
beetle-killed trees off California 243, Regelbrugge said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Department of Forestry is removing infested trees
from private property around town to stem the spread of the beetles.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, crews felled half a dozen dead and dying pines from an
Idyllwild lot hit hard by beetles. Workers scaled one blighted tree
to lop off branches, then hacked a notch along its two-foot-wide
trunk. Pulling in unison, they toppled it, and it landed with a
resounding thump on the roadside. Globs of sap marked scars where the
tree tried and failed to fight the beetles. White, rice-like larvae
wiggled in crevices of its bark.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Forestry routinely removes blighted trees and
has cut nearly 1,000 since last summer, Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the bark beetle infestation, the Riverside County
Board of Supervisors appropriated an emergency fund of $200,000 last
month for removal of several hundred more trees around town. But the
cost of containing the infestation is only part of its price, Turner
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a dollar loss and also an aesthetic loss, because we're
losing the visual beauty of some of the trees," he said. "A lot of
people are up here because they love the mountains and they love the
trees. It becomes an emotional issue up here."</TE>

<HD>Ban on Citrus Imports Upheld</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Farmers in county are pleased that Argentine
fruit will continue to be barred from U.S. markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County growers cheered a decision that continues a ban on the
importation of Argentine citrus until new studies prove that the
imports pose no risk to the domestic market.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Justice Department dropped its appeal last week of a
court ruling suspending the importation program, clearing the way for
a new round of studies.</LD>
<LD>   "I think this validates the concerns we've had and shows that our
arguments are legitimate," said Link Leavens, a farmer who manages
700 acres of lemons and avocados in Ventura County. "We're not
opposed to [importation], we just want it to be fair and safe."</LD>
<TE>   Citing concerns about pests and disease, growers from across the
country filed suit last year seeking to overturn a decision by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture to allow Argentine fruit into certain
regions of the country.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. District Court judge in Fresno blocked the shipments last
fall, saying that agricultural officials failed to adequately assess
the risk of disease from the imports to the domestic market.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Robert E. Coyle ruled that the USDA must conduct a more
thorough risk analysis and provide evidence that the imports would
not harm the nation's citrus growers before shipments continued.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department immediately announced plans to appeal the
ruling but dropped that bid last week.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1 million cartons of Argentine lemons, oranges and
grapefruits have been shipped into the United States since the
importation program began in the summer of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The fruit was immediately allowed into 34 states, and after four
years could have been sent directly to the nation's five
citrus-producing states, including California and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Paula-based U.S. Citrus Science Council led the charge
against the program, arguing that the USDA had not done enough to
safeguard the nation's $2.5-billion citrus industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The Justice Department's decision to drop its appeal closes this
chapter on a bad proposal originating with the previous
[presidential] administration," said Joel Nelsen, co-chairman of the
science council, which represents more than 5,000 growers.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to working with this administration to establish
a science-based proposal that fully protects the domestic citrus
industry from devastating pests and diseases," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the path forged by California citrus producers is one
that will benefit growers throughout the country."</TE>

<HD>Posh 'Lifestyle Center' or 'That Thing'?</HD>
<DH>Retail: Oceanfront mall above Crystal Cove State Park is
bemoaned by preservationists but seen as a celebration of the
outdoors by an Irvine Co. official.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's latest upscale retail plaza promises to trump the
competition when it opens this fall, offering shoppers unobstructed
panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island as they sip
their lattes and peruse the racks of the trendiest boutiques and
chain clothiers.</LD>
<LD>   The only interruption between the Spanish colonial-style buildings
along the bluffs and the ocean will be a few lanes of Coast Highway
and the pristine, sandy beaches of Crystal Cove State Park. The
water's edge is just a long Frisbee throw away.</LD>
<LD>   Many locals a few miles to the south in Laguna Beach, not to
mention preservationists elsewhere, are aghast.</LD>
<TE>   They have known for years that this was coming. It's part of a
deal worked out with the Irvine Co. long ago that saved the
ecologically sensitive coastal park from development. But they have
been jolted anew by buildings rising from the sandy soil, with
haberdasheries and swanky bistros negotiating deals to move in.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co. officials call their project the Crystal Cove
Promenade.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Droz calls it "that thing."</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of the steering committee for Vision Laguna, a group
aimed at preserving the village charm of the small coastal city,
complains that the shopping center has taken "a big bite out of the
Coast Highway," a stretch long known for its scenery, with unspoiled
canyons on one side and ocean views on the other.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad," he said. "That used to be such a great decompression
zone into Laguna."</TE>
<TE>   Droz brands the shopping center a "Newport-style operation" on
Laguna's border.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna officials had little influence over the development plans
because the land is outside its borders and under county
jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Barbara Mission-themed promenade, with its terra cotta
tile roofs, is meant to complement the million-dollar mini-mansions
in the Newport Coast community, which covers the hills above the
park. Residents have been rooting for the Promenade project on their
community Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The development will ultimately have 125,000 square feet of
leasable space for several stores, two restaurants and possibly a gas
station, according to a report from the county Planning and
Development Services Department.</TE>
<TE>   Just don't call it a mall.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials prefer "lifestyle center." This will be the
Irvine Co.'s third such center with a coastal theme. The others are
Fashion Island, with its outdoor gathering areas, and Corona del Mar
Plaza, where seashells are embedded in the walkways. The views and
breezes offered by those centers, however, don't come close to what
the Crystal Cove Promenade will provide.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a place designed to celebrate the outdoor coastal
experience," said Francine Pares, a spokeswoman for the Irvine Co.</TE>
<TE>   The Gap and Gap Kids have announced they will be tenants, joining
such shops as UhOh Clothing Boutique, which an Irvine Co. release
promises is one of the "premier fashion boutiques of the West Coast."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Gollis, a principal of the Concord Group, a land-use
consultancy in Newport Beach, said the promenade will be a "prestige
location" for the larger retailers. Although customer traffic will be
much lower than at a typical mall--there is no freeway access and the
place is boxed in by the coast--the views, breezes and high-end
clientele will lend the stores the kind of cachet that being on Rodeo
Drive or Fifth Avenue does. Companies will open stores even if they
offer marginal profits, Gollis said, because the locations provide a
marketing boost.</TE>
<TE>   Although Laguna Beach officials said that's exactly the type of
place they don't want in, or even near, their village, some are
staying optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Councilwoman Cheryl Kinsman said the new retail center
could bring into sharper focus the small-town qualities that set
Laguna apart from other coastal cities.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what it will truly do is show the contrast," she said.</TE>

<HD>Crowds Mourn 2 Slain Cousins</HD>
<DH>Grief: A makeshift memorial in a tight- knit neighborhood
draws hundreds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even in a city where makeshift memorials appear nearly every day, the
one last week in Panorama City seemed exceptional.</LD>
<LD>   It marked the violent, unsolved deaths of two cousins who lived on
Wakefield Avenue all their lives, inspiring an outpouring of love,
tears and memories in this tight-knit middle-class community.</LD>
<LD>   Every night, crowds, sometimes numbering in the hundreds, have
gathered to remember John Shellabarger, 26, and Philip Gearhart, 24.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday night, mourners placed more than 500 candles near the
site where the two were shot to death.</TE>
<TE>   The nightmare for family and friends of the victims began early
April 6. Neighbors later reported hearing gunshots about 2:15 a.m. No
one called 911.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before 6 a.m., police discovered the two bullet-riddled
bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Shellabarger was found slumped over the front seat of his car.
Gearhart's body lay nearby on the grass parkway, across the street
from his parents' home.</TE>
<TE>   Shellabarger had reportedly been involved in a fight that night at
the California Broiler and Sports Bar on Tampa Avenue in Northridge,
where he, his cousin and a few friends were drinking.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a minor, one-on-one fight," said Anntonette Watson,
owner of the restaurant. She said the two groups were quickly
separated and escorted outside.</TE>
<TE>   One of Shellabarger's friends suggested that Shellabarger, a
6-foot, 220-pound former baseball catcher at UCLA, Los Angeles Valley
College and Monroe High School, may have been going to the aid of his
cousin.</TE>
<TE>   "John was tough, but he never, never started fights," said Chris
Stell, 28, who had known Shellabarger for 17 years. "But he was
protective of his friends."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Shellabarger, who worked for an insurance company, nor
Gearhart, who was training to be a manager at a video arcade, had a
criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   "These are good kids," said Paul Shellabarger, John's father,
looking at the crowd that had come to pay respects on a recent night.
"Look at all these people. This street is like a small town. They've
known John since grammar school. Did you know he was a straight-A
student?"</TE>
<TE>   As friend after friend spoke about the cousins, Gearhart's father
held a candle and listened.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe this," said Bill Gearhart, 58, slowly shaking his
head. "It's so difficult to handle, because he was so active.</TE>
<TE>   "The outstanding thing I remember is Philip's love for kids," said
Gearhart.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled how devastated his son became after learning a young
boy he knew had been hurt in an accident. "He just went to pieces."</TE>
<TE>   Philip's best friend, Domenick Poncin, 22, quietly walked past the
flickering candles, stopping occasionally to hug friends and family
of his fallen buddy.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard Saturday what happened, half of me died," said
Poncin.</TE>
<TE>   Gearhart was tall and athletic, known as a youth for his reckless
abandon. Stories were told of him falling out of trees, skating and
crashing into walls and snowboarding down dangerous runs.</TE>
<TE>   A few days before he died, Shellabarger was telling his friend
Stell about how he had recently proposed to his girlfriend, Maria
Miranda, who is in the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   "He took her to Disneyland and he got down on his knees in front
of the castle, gave her a ring and proposed to her," said Stell. "He
was so happy to start his family. He didn't want to hang out
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   A friend of the cousins, Jackie "Zippy" Trinidad, 22, broke down
as she tried to tell a story about Gearhart. Shellabarger's sister,
Amy Richardson, came to her aid, holding the sobbing Trinidad, who
expressed sadness that Gearhart would never again do one of the
things he loved best in life--snowboarding.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, he will," said Richardson, wiping tears from Trinidad's
eyes. "Zippy, don't you know there's snow in heaven?"</TE>

<HD>Immigrants Decry Multiple Probes for License</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Sheriff Baca wants third background check of
undocumented workers who seek driving privileges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Negotiators of a bill to allow unlawful immigrants to drive legally
in California disclosed Friday that Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee
Baca is pressing for a state background investigation of potential
applicants to identify criminals and terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Immigrants seeking to become citizens and permanent residents
already undergo two background checks by the FBI and U.S. Department
of Justice. The proposed third investigation would be conducted by
state agents.</LD>
<LD>   "It fits in line with making sure they do not have any criminal
history in California, in particular, and in the United States, in
general," Baca said of his idea. "California cannot afford to be
careless."</LD>
<TE>   Baca's proposal comes as negotiators convened by Gov. Gray Davis
are trying to work out details of a bill to allow immigrants who
entered the country illegally to apply for a California driver's
license. Proponents say it would be safer to license illegal
immigrants than to have them driving without licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill being discussed, to qualify for a license the
immigrant motorists would have to be seeking citizenship or permanent
residency, have a taxpayer identification number in lieu of a Social
Security number, have a clean criminal history and provide a
thumbprint.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, immigrant-rights advocates were quick to criticize
Baca's proposal. They said Baca and law enforcement executives are
attempting to take advantage of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to
acquire unrelated new powers.</TE>
<TE>   "Law enforcement is actually trying to obtain things through this
bill that really are not related to post-Sept. 11 concerns," said
Maria Blanco of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund. "They are a law enforcement wish list."</TE>
<TE>   Rini Chakraborty of the California Immigrant Welfare Collaborative
said a third background check of prospective drivers based on
immigration status was unnecessary. "Terrorists are no more
representative of immigrants than Timothy McVeigh was of citizens,"
she said. "They're seeking the American dream, not trying to destroy
it."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Davis noted that no recommendations have yet been
made to him by the negotiators of the bill. He said the governor had
no position on ordering additional background checks.</TE>
<TE>   The immigrant-rights activists charged that the latest suggestion
by Baca mirrors an earlier "repugnant" proposal that also was
advanced by Baca and defended by Davis' aides. That idea would stamp
a letter or number on an immigrant's license that would identify the
motorist as undocumented.</TE>
<TE>   Baca said this would alert police officers that they were dealing
with someone who had entered the country illegally.</TE>
<TE>   But such a "scarlet letter," the immigrant-rights advocates said,
offered an open invitation to discrimination and harassment by police
and others.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles), author of the
bill (AB 60) to give illegal immigrants driving privileges, said he
was aware of the negotiators' conflict over a state background check.
Even so, Cedillo said, he and Davis were "very close" to reaching an
agreement that would enable the immigrants to drive legally while
still protecting Californians from terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo stressed that reaching a settlement will require law
enforcement negotiators and immigrant advocates to demonstrate
"flexibility" in resolving remaining issues, including the proposed
criminal background check.</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo said the negotiators, recruited last fall by Davis in the
aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and on
the Pentagon, were committed to devising the "safest and most secure
driving document" for immigrants who had entered the country
illegally but have lived in California for years.</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo, the car insurance industry and an array of peace officer
executives support the plan, contending that everyone would be safer
if these immigrants were tested and licensed by the Department of
Motor Vehicles and purchased required insurance policies.</TE>
<TE>   A similar bill by Cedillo was vetoed two years ago by Davis.
Cedillo pushed it through the Legislature again last year, but it was
cast into legal limbo in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks
because Davis neither signed nor vetoed it.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, it was considered politically impossible for Davis to
sign the bill because of public outrage when it was learned that some
of the hijackers had fake American driver's licenses. However, he
appointed a special task force of law enforcement and administration
officials to try to work out a compromise bill this session.</TE>
<TE>   Baca acknowledged Friday that background investigations by state
agents would be costly, but said he had not suggested how they would
be financed. One possibility, he said, would be for immigrant drivers
to pay an additional fee.</TE>

<HD>Debris Reignites Flames at Factory</HD>
<DH>Fire: A column of black smoke billows into the sky for a
second day in South Gate. Evacuated residents return home.</DH>

<LD>Smoldering debris ignited briefly outside a South Gate plastics
factory Saturday, sending flames and a black column of smoke into the
sky for the second time in as many days.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County firefighters spent much of Friday night
battling a raging blaze that tore through a storage area for plastic
containers at Productivity California in the 10600 block of Sessler
Street, near the Long Beach Freeway and Imperial Highway. The site
was erroneously identified earlier as White Metal Products Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Productivity California, which is housed in a nondescript
warehouse surrounded by other industrial businesses, manufactures
plastic planters and other containers.</LD>
<TE>   The blaze downed several power lines, exploded oil drums and led
South Gate police to evacuate as many as 200 nearby residents.</TE>
<TE>   By Saturday morning, residents were allowed to return. Electrical
service also was restored to 400 homes that had lost power, according
to Southern California Edison.</TE>
<TE>   There was some concern Friday about the possibility of the burning
plastic spreading toxic materials into the neighborhood's air or the
nearby Los Angeles River.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials said Saturday that there were "zero environmental
hazards" because none of the runoff from extinguishing the blaze
reached the river, and that Air Quality Management District tests of
the air "were fine."</TE>
<TE>   The flare-up occurred as cleanup crews were working near the base
of an electrical line tower, said county fire spokesman Brian Jordan.
It was extinguished in less than 20 minutes by firefighters who had
remained near the scene to handle such an event, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The flare-up gave nearby residents, some of whom had returned to
their homes just a few hours earlier after spending the night with
relatives, a case of the jitters.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Elizando and his wife, returning from a night out Friday to
find their street blocked off, spent the night at his sister's home.</TE>
<TE>   When the sparks reignited Saturday, Elizando clambered onto his
roof and peered over his backyard wall for a closer look at the
roiling flames. "I'm worried," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan said flare-ups were not uncommon, and that a fire crew
would remain on the scene to monitor the situation.</TE>

<HD>Hunt Is On for Missing Search and Rescue Dog</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A search and rescue dog trained to locate disaster victims in
hard-to-reach places has disappeared from his own backyard.</LD>
<LD>   Max ran away from his La Habra Heights home right after eating his
dinner April 2. Despite the desperate search attempts of his owner,
Los Angeles County Firefighter Bill Monahan, the boisterous black
Labrador without a collar has remained lost.</LD>
<LD>   When he's off duty, the 6-year-old canine with his own Fire
Department badge goes home to a dog run at the Monahan house--and his
collar is removed for his own comfort.</LD>
<TE>   On the night Max disappeared, Monahan's son let him out of his
kennel so he could enjoy his dry kibble with the family's two other
dogs, German shepherds that have free rein on the unfenced one-acre
property. He wandered off and hasn't been seen since.</TE>
<TE>   Monahan said the whole family is heartbroken. Not to mention the
grief at the fire station.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of us," Monahan said. "He's part of the rescue team."</TE>
<TE>   Monahan's children, 18-year-old Bill Jr. and 11-year-old Jennifer,
helped train Max, who has been with the family since he was 3 months
old. The estimated cost of the dog's training was $20,000, Monahan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer used to crawl into cabinets and under sinks in the
family's house and wait for Max to find her. She also taught Max how
to climb the ladder on her jungle gym.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Jr. would take a bottle of water, lower himself into concrete
piles used for training, and wait up to two hours for Max and other
search and rescue dogs to sniff him out.</TE>
<TE>   The dog has never actually found anyone who was lost during a
disaster. He was scheduled to go to New York and comb through the
rubble at the World Trade Center, Monahan said, but he never got the
call.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Southern California, he has been on two missions. Once he
was sent through a collapsed apartment building to find survivors,
but it later turned out that everyone had already been evacuated.
Another time, he searched bushes after a car accident until it was
determined that no one had been ejected from the car.</TE>
<TE>   But from his dog run at Fire Station 91 in Hacienda Heights, Max
was ever-prepared for earthquake, fire and flood, Monahan said.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes Max decided to follow a friendly jogger home, and is now
sitting in someone's fenced backyard.</TE>
<TE>   If that is the case, Monahan said he hopes that Max's hosts will
bring him home. He can also be dropped off at any county fire
station.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Monahan is putting up posters and making the
rounds of local dog pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Max is all black and has no markings, except for a faint tattoo of
his 1995 birth date in one of his ears. He weighs 60 to 70 pounds.
Anyone who has seen him can call any county fire station.</TE>

<HD>Home Has Care in Mind</HD>
<DH>Aging: New center for Alzheimer's patients incorporates the
latest science in its design.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recent discoveries about Alzheimer's disease inform every inch of the
newest building at Los Angeles Jewish Home for the Aging in Reseda.
But there is nothing sterile about the Paul Goldenberg and Daphna and
Richard Ziman Special Care Center.</LD>
<LD>   As Molly Forrest, the home's chief executive, pointed out during a
tour, 96 people will live at the center, each in a room with a large
window. Natural light seems to lessen the anxiety of those with
dementia and to help them sleep.</LD>
<LD>   Designers of the $13-million building referred to a thick stack of
current Alzheimer's research to make their decisions, Forrest said.</LD>
<TE>   The nearly 50,000-square-foot building is divided into sections,
or clusters. In each cluster, the walls and furnishings are done in a
given shade of noninstitutional peach, gray-blue or green, making it
easier for residents with tattered memories to find their
"neighborhood" by its distinctive color.</TE>
<TE>   There are no dark colors on the rugs or floors because Alzheimer's
patients often interpret these as holes. They will painstakingly
avoid them, putting themselves at greater risk of falling, Forrest
said.</TE>
<TE>   A glass-fronted "memory box" hangs on the wall outside each
resident's room. Family members may fill the box with mementos of the
resident's life. The memory boxes acknowledge the things that have
been important to the individual and help them stay oriented.</TE>
<TE>   "As I'm walking down the hall, I see my wedding picture, my
children's pictures, my military papers," Forrest said.</TE>
<TE>   The need for specialized facilities to care for people with
dementia is only going to increase, said Peter Braun, executive
director of the Alzheimer's Assn. in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Alzheimer's disease is affecting more and more people in our
society, as our society ages," Braun said. "In L.A. County alone,
there are more than 150,000 people with Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimer's and related dementias affect one in 10 of those over 65,
but almost half of those over 85."</TE>
<TE>   Braun said he was impressed with the capability of the new
facility to meet the needs of individuals at different stages of the
disease. Currently, more than 70% of people with dementia are cared
for at home, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you walk in, you feel like you're walking into a fine
hotel," Forrest said of the lobby, with its grand piano. Such touches
contribute to "resident dignity," something easily lost in the
dehumanizing course of Alzheimer's disease.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest refers to the lobby area as "town central." The intent,
she said, is to recreate, inside the building, the atmosphere of a
small, friendly town. Residents may be easily confused, but they
still need an environment complex enough to pique their interest.</TE>
<TE>   "There are things to do, to see and experience that will stimulate
your senses," Forrest said.</TE>
<TE>   Off the lobby is an area, reached by a door marked "cafe," where
residents will be able to get a bagel or other nosh. Another door
leads to the facility's gift shop. A feature of the shop will be a
rack where lost items of clothing will be hung.</TE>
<TE>   It is one of the features added after planners canvassed nursing
homes throughout the country asking, Forrest said: "What did you do
that worked and what did you do that you would have done
differently?"</TE>
<TE>   Alzheimer's patients seem to cope with their agitation by
wandering, so the building has a system of curving paths that allow
the residents to keep moving safely without coming to a sudden,
disorienting stop. There are also places to stop and rest along the
way. Without them, Forrest said, Alzheimer's patients will sometimes
walk until they are exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   The center has private areas where families may celebrate Shabbat
with a resident and where disruptive residents can be cared for
without upsetting others.</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Newstat of West Los Angeles said she is happy that her
90-year-old mother, Tillie Kaiser, will soon be moving into the
center. Newstat said her mother was always an active person, who
drove until she was 85. Newstat said she is glad the center
incorporates strategies for stimulating the residents.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to make them aspire to the best possible place
they can be," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Jewish Home for the Aging was founded 90 years ago to provide
a Passover seder to five homeless men, Forrest said. It has a special
commitment to the Jewish poor. Seventy-five percent of the residents
are financially needy.</TE>
<TE>   There are almost 300 names on the waiting list for the new center,
which includes 12 beds for end-of-life or hospice care. The home
gives priority to Holocaust survivors (20 are currently on the list)
and Righteous Gentiles, non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews
during the Holocaust, Forrest said. Next in line are observant Jews.</TE>
<TE>   The cost for those paying privately will be $210 a day for a
semiprivate room.</TE>
<TE>   The rituals of Jewish life will be observed throughout the center,
to be dedicated today. When a resident dies, the family will be able
to sit shiva in his or her room, and the empty bed will not be filled
until the traditional seven days of mourning is completed, said
Forrest.</TE>
<TE>   Jules Fogel, chairman of the building committee, said his group
hammered out every detail of the new center, from the style of the
armoires in the rooms to the chairs in the hospice wing that fold out
for sleeping.</TE>
<TE>   "We're building a home for 96 very worthy residents," Fogel said.
"It's a tremendous privilege for us to be involved in a project like
this."</TE>

<HD>Mission Viejo Priest Removed While Church Investigates 1978
Claim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Jesuit priest assigned to a Mission Viejo Catholic Church has been
removed temporarily from his duties while church officials
investigate a claim that he molested a child more than two decades
ago in Texas, diocese officials said late Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Shocked parishioners at St. Kilian Church were notified of Father
Tom Naughton's removal at the end of Mass on Saturday in a brief
announcement by Father James P. Dunning, the parish priest.</LD>
<LD>   Dunning told parishioners that Naughton had been accused of sexual
misconduct in 1978, a parishioner said. Dunning could not be reached
Saturday for comment.</LD>
<TE>   "There was a stunned silence in the church," said Genevieve Hamm,
a 20-year member of the church, who attended the Mass. Naughton, 68,
is the third Orange County priest removed from his duties in recent
months amid a nationwide sex-abuse scandal that has swept the Roman
Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   Diocese of Orange officials said they were told of the allegation
against Naughton by his superiors in the Society of Jesus, also known
as the Jesuits, on April 5. The order is investigating the claim.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Naughton agreed to go on administrative leave in
accordance with diocesepolicy on dealing with sex-abuse allegations
against priests, said diocese spokeswoman Maria Schinderle.</TE>
<TE>   Schinderle said she had not spoken with Naughton and did not know
whether he denied the allegation or whether law enforcement officials
had been notified about the claim. Naughton could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   St. Kilian is one of three parishes served by Serra Catholic
Elementary School in Rancho Santa Margarita, but there was no
immediate indication that Naughton's duties involved the school.</TE>
<TE>   Though a visiting priest at St. Kilian, Naughton was a regular
fixture for years, saying morning Mass on weekdays.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very dedicated, very knowledgeable," said parishioner Tom
Brown. "It's really going to shake up the whole parish." Last month,
Father Michael Pecharich was asked to leave his 12-year position at
San Francisco Solano Church in Rancho Santa Margarita after he
admitted molesting a teenage boy 19 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the diocese paid $5.2million to settle molestation
charges brought by one alleged victim against Msgr. Michael Harris, a
popular principal at Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho
Santa Margarita. The diocese has asked Vatican officials to remove
Harris from the priesthood as part of the settlement and agreed,
along with the diocese of Los Angeles, to fire any priests with a
history of child molestation.</TE>
<TE>   In September, John Lenihan was removed as pastor of St. Edward
Church in Dana Point after he, under the pseudonym "Father X,"
revealed to a Los Angeles Times columnist that he had had several
sexual relationships. In 1991, Lenihan admitted sexually abusing a
teenage girl in the 1970s. The church paid the victim $25,000. Weeks
ago, the dioceses of Los Angeles and Orange paid $1.2 million to a
woman who alleged Lenihan impregnated her as a teenager and paid for
her abortion.</TE>

<HD>Foundation Ponders Seed Money for the Great Outdoors</HD>
<DH>Fund: Community group may ask donors for $500,000 to set up
support system for county environmental programs and activities.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After setting up special accounts to assist women and Latinos,
Ventura County's largest charitable foundation may now create a broad
new fund to support outdoor activities and restoration of natural
habitats.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next two months, the Ventura County Community Foundation
will reach out to 16 potential donors and recipients to ask what they
think of creating a "Great Outdoors Fund."</LD>
<LD>   Foundation directors are expected to decide in June whether to
gather $500,000 to assist programs that celebrate the environment and
allow the public to enjoy it. The new fund, for example, could help
maintain hiking and biking trails, replant natural vegetation or
underwrite grant applications by other nonprofit groups.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of people have said this seems like a natural," foundation
Executive Director Kate McLean said. "This might be one vehicle all
people can agree is good."</TE>
<TE>   The Great Outdoors Fund would be the largest of more than 300
funds the nonprofit Community Foundation has started since it was
created in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The other special funds already in existence--Women's Legacy,
Hispanic Legacy and the Heritage Fund--provide seed money to
community groups that help needy women, promote Latino programs and
preserve Ventura County's history and artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   The Community Foundation has grown rapidly and now has $34 million
in assets.</TE>
<TE>   The women's fund has grown to $500,000 and the Hispanic fund to
$400,000. About 5% of the endowments is spun off each year for
projects, but donations exceed expenditures and the funds continue to
grow.</TE>
<TE>   "When we did Destino [the Hispanic fund] and [women's] legacy,
people said, 'It's a good idea, but I don't think you can do it,'"
McLean said.</TE>
<TE>   "But we did. And I immediately thought this outdoors fund was a
good idea. This could be a fund that brings everybody together who
wants to make an investment in the quality of life in our community."</TE>
<TE>   McLean said the outdoors fund was the idea of foundation director
Dave O. White, an Oxnard developer and avid outdoorsman.</TE>
<TE>   White said the fund would support any organization in the business
of acquiring and enhancing open space.</TE>
<TE>   "But first we want to make sure there's a feeling by both
environmentalists and potential donors that this makes sense and that
there's financial support to make it happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   White thinks there is. He was joined on the foundation's
exploratory committee by another developer, Dan Selleck of Thousand
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The committee represents a broad spectrum of the county--farmers,
builders and environmentalists, McLean said. And the fund would be
apolitical.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't meant to be a political action committee," said
committee member Carl Thelander, an Ojai consultant and author of a
1996 book on California's endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   Thelander works for free for the nonprofit Ojai Valley Land
Conservancy. And he said he sees a need for "bridge funds" to provide
such groups with money for studies of how to improve or expand the
county's public open space.</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura County is kind of the frontier," he said. "It's on the
edge of development and the undeveloped areas to the north. So it has
a unique opportunity to decide what areas it wants to set aside as
open space."</TE>

<HD>Thieves Stealing Coachella Valley Date Palm Shoots</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: To deter a growing black market, ranchers
paint stumps various colors to make them easier to identify.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least 95% of the nation's dates are grown in or near California's
Coachella Valley, but in recent years, the emergence of the date palm
as an ornamental landscaping tree of choice has dramatically
increased the value of the industry, which is now battling a problem
of theft.</LD>
<LD>   Although the dates themselves require intensive labor to grow and
turn out well only in the hot desert climate of the Coachella Valley,
with its particular ground water and rainfall patterns, the trees
flourish over much wider areas of Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   And though fully grown trees are difficult to uproot and
transport, offshoots that sprout from the trunks are easy to cut off
and steal.</LD>
<TE>   Once planted, these shoots grow into copies of the mother tree
that can be sold on the black market for $60 to $250, depending on
their size.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Burke of the California Date Commission said about 2,000
offshoots were stolen from date palm growers in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Although commission efforts to combat theft reduced those numbers
in 2000 and 2001, thefts are on the increase again, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Riverside County sheriff's deputies arrested
an alleged ringleader of palm thieves, Miguel Santana, 48, of Thermal
on suspicion of grand theft, receiving stolen property and
conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Two men who said they were working for Santana told authorities
they stole 73 tree offshoots valued at about $6,600.</TE>
<TE>   Santana was arrested in another date palm theft case last year,
and convicted of a misdemeanor of receiving stolen property.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Burke said, date commissioners hope he will be charged
with a felony and serve extensive jail time.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials recently have become more interested in
prosecuting such cases, realizing that the thefts have grown into a
considerable business, Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   Dustin Wiley, deputy agricultural commissioner for Riverside
County, said the most recent crop report shows that in 2000--the
latest year for which figures are available--5,376 acres in the
Coachella Valley were planted in date orchards and that 3,710 of
those acres were bearing fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Burke said it takes the trees five or six years to bear fruit and
10 years to produce maximum yields.</TE>
<TE>   As a means of detecting the thefts, he said, ranchers have been
painting the stumps of the offshoots various colors to make them
easier to identify. It is something akin to branding cattle, Burke
said.</TE>
<TE>   John Beck, executive director of the California Date Commission,
said the sale of dates brings in about $36 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   He had no estimate of the annual value of the stolen offshoots but
said, "We're hoping to publicize the theft problem so people will be
aware of it."</TE>

<HD>After Security Breaches at Nuclear Plant, Fallout Would
Help</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Want some terrifying bedtime reading?</LD>
<LD>   Don't bother with Stephen King or Dean Koontz. Just curl up with a
recent edition of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and let
Daniel Hirsch scare you to death.</LD>
<LD>   Hirsch, who heads an anti-nuclear group in Los Angeles, writes
that many of the nation's nuclear reactors, including the two at the
San Onofre plant in south Orange County, remain vulnerable to a
terrorist attack. Some congressmen agree.</LD>
<TE>   And why am I not particularly soothed when the federal agency that
regulates the nuclear industry says all is well? Could it be because
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said right after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks that U.S. nuclear plants were built to withstand
airplane impact, only to say a few days later they were referring
only to small airplanes, not necessarily commercial jets?</TE>
<TE>   It didn't improve Hirsch's mood that, when I spoke to him a couple
of days ago, a federal review of the San Onofre plant had found two
security breaches--both occurring after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The government said the breaches--two unescorted people trying to
enter a control room and an inadequate inspection of a San Onofre
firetruck near a protected area--were relatively minor.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch begs to differ.</TE>
<TE>   "I was troubled, because they occurred within weeks of Sept. 11,
at a time when the reactors were supposed to be at their highest
state of alert," he says. "The entire safety of the reactors is based
on access restrictions."</TE>
<TE>   The maddening thing is that average citizens don't know whether
what Hirsch writes and thinks is closer to fact or fiction.</TE>
<TE>   Do we believe him or the government that regulates the industry?</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch, whose group is called the Committee to Bridge the Gap,
alternately laughs ruefully and laments as he describes the NRC's
long-standing oversight of nuclear plants. "The problem is, the
regulations for protecting nuclear power plants are a quarter-century
old," he says. "They were established in the mid-1970s. They required
only a security system capable of repelling an attack by three
terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   So when federal officials or plant operators say the facilities
were designed with terrorists in mind, Hirsch isn't consoled.</TE>
<TE>   The two post-Sept. 11 breaches only deepened his concern. "The one
moment on Earth when you'd think they wouldn't have a problem ...
[and] they were having these kind of lax controls ... makes me
extremely nervous about the longer term."</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts Rep. Edward Markey, a longtime critic of the nuclear
industry, alleged in a report two weeks ago that the nation's 100 or
so commercial nuclear reactors remain vulnerable to terrorism, with
little done to reduce the threat. Federal officials disagreed and
said they'd offer a detailed rebuttal at a later date.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch wrote in the scientists' journal that security regulations
in the nation's nuclear plants are "dismally inadequate and
outmoded." And because of the damage that would result from the
release of radioactivity from even one of San Onofre's reactors, the
stakes are immense, Hirsch says.</TE>
<TE>   "I've agonized over this issue for 15 years," he says. "To go
public, [I thought] that might give ideas to the terrorists. For 15
years, through back channels, we've tried to get the NRC to fix this
[security] problem."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Hirsch says, it's common knowledge that terrorists know a lot
about U.S. nuclear power plants and see them as potential targets.</TE>
<TE>   In his article, Hirsch wrote, "The press has focused on the
vulnerability of reactor containment buildings to airborne attack....
Excessive emphasis on the risk of air attack obscures the far larger
and more frightening possibility of ground assault or the threat from
insiders [on "soft targets" inside plants that protect against
radioactive release].''</TE>
<TE>   That's pretty scary, I tell him.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, he says, I scared him.</TE>
<TE>   "I was nervous when you called me," he says. "I'm terrified every
day I'm going to get a call from a reporter saying there has been a
true attack on San Onofre."</TE>

<HD>Weekend's Other Big Race</HD>
<DH>Sports: Long Beach's Congressional Cup sailing event is a
quiet alternative to grand prix.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It had turned into a beautiful day. The sun was up, seagulls were
swooping overhead, and out on the water off Long Beach, 10 matching
boats unfurled red, white and blue sails.</LD>
<LD>   Onshore, a cell phone rang.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm at the Long Beach Grand Prix," the man who answered it told
his wife, drawing loud guffaws from the few dozen people sitting on
bleachers at the edge of Long Beach's Belmont Pier.</LD>
<TE>   The three-day auto grand prix may be the big crowd-drawer in Long
Beach this weekend. But for the spectators who skipped work to take
in five days of sailboat racing, the Long Beach Yacht Club's
Congressional Cup was the only race in town.</TE>
<TE>   In its 38th year, the Congressional Cup race has become a fixture
on the international racing circuit. More than 325 volunteers, mostly
members of the Long Beach Yacht Club, organize the annual regatta,
which pits 10 six-man crews against one another in a series of match
races.</TE>
<TE>   This year's race has the added bonus of being a practice ground
for the America's Cup race, sailing's premier matchup.</TE>
<TE>   But whereas the Cup boats are high-tech marvels that can cost
millions of dollars, the identical 37-foot Catalina boats in which
each Congressional Cup team competes represent a return to the basics
of sailing, said Mike Van Dyke, the club's principal race officer.
"The America's Cup has become technology-driven," he said. "But in
this race, the boats are identical, so it comes down to knowledge,
experience and skill."</TE>
<TE>   In match racing, teams compete head-to-head, and a "flight"--a
series of five matchups, each starting a few minutes apart from one
another--can last less than an hour. Once on the course, each boat
must round the track twice, racing around two triangular orange buoys
placed about half a mile apart and aligned with the wind's direction.</TE>
<TE>   As long as competitors stay within the diamond-shaped boundaries
of the course and round the appropriate markers along the way, the
first boat across the finish is the winner. But how they do so is a
decision made by a tactician on each boat. In sailing, the shortest
distance between two points is not necessarily a straight line.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like playing a chess match," said competitor Mike Pentecost
of Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Pentecost's teammates, a combination of Danish and American
talent, sailed together for the first time only last Monday. Their
skipper, 30-year-old Jes Gram-Hansen, is ranked No. 3 in the world in
match racing. But unlike most of his competitors, Gram-Hansen is
without a deep-pocketed sponsor. Gram-Hansen said he uses the prize
money to pay the rent back home in Aahus, Denmark.</TE>
<TE>   Crewman Kevin McCarthy, also of Long Beach, said the team came
together quickly on the first day of practice under Gram-Hansen's
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all very interactive," McCarthy said. One guy "works the
pit" (the area from which the boat is steered) while another "trims
the main and drives the boat upwind."</TE>
<TE>   As two boats rounded the orange buoy floating in the water at the
north end of the course, they raised the smaller white sails that
powered the boats into the wind. One more lap to go.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the weekend is over, each Congressional Cup team will
have competed in 16 flights. The top four teams after regular
competition battled it out Saturday afternoon for the chance to win
$25,000 in prize money and points toward the international Swedish
Match Tour title. Luc Pillot, skipper of the French team "Le Defi,"
won the race's booby prize, a copy of Arthur Knapp's classic book,
"Racing Your Boat Right," on Friday after finishing last with four
wins and 12 losses.</TE>
<TE>   Fans lined up along the pier used binoculars and camera lenses to
zoom in on the action. They were quiet, mostly, concentrating on
following the complex choreography as boats vied for position. On the
water, more spectators camped out atop leisure boats.</TE>
<TE>   As the 37-foot boats tilted and swung, passing within feet of each
other on their way to the finish line, Jerry Bermingham, a sales
representative from the Long Beach area, took in a breath of salty
ocean air. He had spent most of his week sitting on the bleachers at
the end of the pier. "I'd rather do this than work any day," he said.
"I've loved this game forever; it's so spectacular to watch."</TE>
<TE>   Then he whispered conspiratorially. "Just don't tell my boss I'm
sitting out here."</TE>

<HD>Teacher Hopefuls Set Sights on Pupils</HD>
<DH>Education: More than 100 prospects turn out for a Santa Ana
recruiting session.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tanya Ramos, a single mother of a 6-year-old girl, has wanted to be a
teacher "since I can remember." On Saturday, she donned a suit and a
smile and took a step toward her dream.</LD>
<LD>   Ramos, 26, was among more than 100 people seeking teaching jobs
with the Santa Ana Unified School District during a recruiting
session at the district's headquarters. This school year, district
officials have hired about 235 teachers. They don't know yet how many
positions will need to be filled for 2002-03.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana officials scout potential candidates at job fairs and
then invite the best prospects for interviews with administrators and
school principals. Saturday was the first of three recruiting
sessions this spring.</LD>
<TE>   For Ramos, it was another step in a long journey that began when,
as a student, she was inspired by her own teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "There were certain teachers who just made you feel good about
yourself," said Ramos, an Orange native who attended Placentia and La
Habra schools.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos recalled one pivotal moment at La Habra's Sonora High School
when her junior-year English teacher urged her to enroll in an honors
English course.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to," she said. "I felt intimidated, you know. Also,
I didn't want to be the nerd in my group. But about three weeks
later, when she found out I had not signed up for it, she just
transferred me."</TE>
<TE>   Ramos recently finished courses to become a state credentialed
teacher and is working on her master's degree in education at
National University in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates like Ramos are in short supply across the state, said
Kris Marubayashi, co-director of CalTeach, a teacher referral and
recruitment program run by the chancellor's office of the California
State University system.</TE>
<TE>   California public schools will need 260,000 to 300,000 new
teachers in the next decade, Marubayashi said, but only about 18,000
are credentialed every year. To make up for the shortage, districts
often issue emergency licenses to candidates with little background
in education.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope programs like CalTeach will lure people to the
profession. But overcrowded and underfunded schools, and a starting
salary of about $35,000, make it difficult to attract new teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "The prestige of being a teacher has really declined," Marubayashi
said.</TE>
<TE>   But that didn't seem to daunt Ramos or the other candidates
waiting their turns Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Rountree, 47, is a nurse, but her real passion is teaching.
She moved from Lafayette, La., to Westminster a year ago to pursue
her new career because, she said, this is where the jobs are.</TE>
<TE>   "And also for the weather," she said. "I got tired of the
mosquitoes and the heat."</TE>
<TE>   Rountree has been a substitute teacher in Huntington Beach and
Garden Grove while studying for her credentials.</TE>
<TE>   "Seeing the students so proud for what they've accomplished--I get
a real kick out of that," she said. Ramos echoed the sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "What could be more important than keeping children interested and
going to school so they can succeed?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos credited her own teachers for keeping her on the straight
and narrow.</TE>
<TE>   "They kept pushing and pushing me," said Ramos, who put herself
through college by working as a waitress and a bilingual assistant at
Magnolia School District. She is a substitute teacher in that
district.</TE>
<TE>   After her interview, Ramos felt good about her chances of getting
her first full-time teaching job.</TE>
<TE>   When she was a Placentia third-grader, Ramos said, a teacher
devised a project to preserve the students' dreams for their futures.

<HD>Plan Would Introduce Lodging at Presidio</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials are discussing a plan to build lodging at the jewel of the
Presidio: Crissy Field.</LD>
<LD>   The Presidio Trust oversees most of the nearly 1,500-acre park. It
proposed 115 rooms of "new construction" for overnight visitors at
Crissy Field. It also plans 66 rooms of lodging in existing buildings
at the Ft. Scott and Main Post areas.</LD>
<LD>   It's not unusual for a national park to offer tourist
accommodations, but the trust's idea has raised concerns because its
draft plan is vague. The former Army base, now a haven for joggers
and bicyclists, has no tourist lodgings.</LD>

<HD>Drive to Secede Proves Persistent</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Early efforts by the Valley to leave Los Angeles
weren't taken seriously. But activists wouldn't give up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, when elected officials and political power brokers in the
San Fernando Valley talked about the small group of relentless
activists who wanted the area to secede from Los Angeles, the
conversation always wound up in the same place: Secession wasn't a
real threat.</LD>
<LD>   But now, secession proposals for the Valley, Hollywood and harbor
area are making their way toward the November ballot, and nearly half
of Los Angeles voters say they would support a civic breakup.</LD>
<LD>   People on both sides of the issue say that years of downplaying
both the determination of the secessionists and the seriousness of
their concerns has strengthened the movement. Secession advocates,
who might otherwise have been brought into the political fold, were
further alienated, and many L.A. residents, who might have benefited
from serious reform, simply became fed up.</LD>
<TE>   "Every time the subject would come up, somebody said, 'Are you
going to organize opposition to this?'" said Larry Levine, a Van Nuys
political consultant who now heads the anti-secession group One Los
Angeles. "We said, 'No, it's going to go away. There's no need to.'</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, last fall, we realized it was not going to go away and
we had to do something."</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, the opposition is organized.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the region's biggest power brokers, including political
consultants Bill Carrick and William Wardlaw, former Mayor Richard J.
Riordan, and billionaire developer Eli Broad have signed on to fight
secession.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a period where everybody thought it was just dead,"
said Broad, who has donated $100,000 to Mayor James K. Hahn's
anti-secession campaign. "I think it's clear everyone is taking it
very seriously right now."</TE>
<TE>   The opposition coalition, led by Hahn, intends to raise $5 million
for the campaign, which also will be fought with local groups such as
Levine's in each breakaway region.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Hahn is working to improve city services. The
mayor has put white-gloved police officers to work directing traffic
at busy intersections in the Valley and Hollywood. He has pushed hard
to help communities create neighborhood councils, which are meant to
make it easier for residents to make their wishes and concerns known
to city officials.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan saw secession in moral terms, as an abandonment of poor
communities by wealthier ones. He pushed for reform of the City
Charter in 1999, in part to respond to unhappiness with the way the
city was being run. The process created a stronger role for the mayor
and established a citywide neighborhood council system that is taking
hold this year.</TE>
<TE>   For Riordan, "this is one of his gut issues," said Robin Kramer,
who served as Riordan's chief of staff for five years. "He spoke out
on this and was not shy on this. This is why as mayor he felt so
passionately about charter reform."</TE>
<TE>   But the charter reform effort was also swamped in political
infighting, resulting in two separate charter reform commissions--one
elected and backed by Riordan and one appointed by the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, secessionists felt neighborhood councils were not
given enough formal power, and some involved believed their concerns
were dismissed by city leaders.</TE>
<TE>   C. Edward Dilkes, an expert on municipal law who served briefly as
director of the elected commission and then as its special counsel,
now backs secession in Hollywood, where he lives.</TE>
<TE>   His efforts at reform in Los Angeles, he said, did little more
than earn him a reputation as a malcontent.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been seriously engaged in an effort to reform Los Angeles
for 25 years," said Dilkes, who has spent most of his career working
as a city attorney for small municipalities. "But those efforts are
not viewed as the efforts of a guy who has a commitment to local
government. They're viewed as the meddling of a crank."</TE>
<TE>   Secession Seemed Too Drastic to Succeed</TE>
<TE>   Kramer said she and others in that administration did not discount
the discontent among some city residents, and worked to reform the
City Charter to respond to those concerns.</TE>
<TE>   But Kramer said she initially did not believe a secession effort
would gain ground--not because it was "quirky or inappropriate," but
because it was such a drastic and unprecedented step.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had an evolving understanding of this," Kramer said. "I
thought it would never make it to serious consideration, let alone
the ballot."</TE>
<TE>   The Valley secession movement, which is the oldest and best
organized of the three, began in 1975, when a group of political
neophytes formed CIVICC, the Committee Investigating Valley
Independent City/County.</TE>
<TE>   Their rebellion was crushed when the California Legislature, in
part thanks to lobbying by then-Mayor Tom Bradley, gave large cities
veto power over secession, even if voters approved it.</TE>
<TE>   But the leaders of the group became powerful over the years: Hal
Bernson, then the owner of a jeans store at the Northridge Fashion
Center, was elected to the Los Angeles City Council in 1979 and
serves as an alternate on the Local Agency Formation Commission, the
state panel overseeing the secession applications. Larry Calemine,
who went on to help develop the huge Warner Center and Porter Ranch
projects, is now the commission's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Another CIVICC member, Paula Boland, was elected to the
Legislature in 1990 and sponsored a bill to repeal the city secession
veto. That bill, which passed in 1997 in the form of a compromise
pushed by state Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) and Assemblyman
Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) after Boland left the Legislature,
allowed secession to go forward if it was approved by voters in both
the breakaway region and the city at large.</TE>
<TE>   Spurred by the change in the law, activists including Richard
Close--then as now president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners
Assn.--Jeff Brain and others began gathering signatures for a
petition to place Valley secession on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   They reached out to nascent secession movements in Hollywood and
the harbor area, offering expertise, funding and even recommendations
for consultants who would develop budgets and other plans for the
proposed new cities.</TE>
<TE>   Secession also gained momentum thanks to a couple of unproven
truisms in Los Angeles politics: A candidate cannot win the mayoralty
without the support of the San Fernando Valley and no one can be
elected to the City Council, the Legislature or Congress from the
Valley without the support of the secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, few area politicians were willing to criticize
secession, or even vote against legislative action that made it
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, in summer 1999, as Valley secession proponents were
beginning the process of putting their proposal on the ballot,
then-Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa was preparing his bid to
become mayor of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa, along with Hertz- berg, led an effort to secure $1.8
million to pay for a LAFCO study of the secession proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that the timing of the mayor's race: Villaraigosa, Hahn,
state Controller Kathleen Connell, City Councilman Joel Wachs, U.S.
Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) and others faced off just last
year, as the progress of the state study made a vote on Valley
secession seem more likely every month.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates Backed Vote on Secession</TE>
<TE>   The candidates adopted a mantra already in use by other
politicians with ties to the Valley: Whatever their personal views on
secession, the people should be allowed to vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that it will divide people instead of bringing them
closer together," Villaraigosa said at the time. "However, 132,000
San Fernando Valley residents who signed petitions in support of
secession indicate strongly to us in Sacramento that this issue must
be studied."</TE>
<TE>   Later this month, the proposal to wrest the Valley from Los
Angeles is expected to move forward significantly, when the final
report from the LAFCO study--penned by Calemine--is released. By
June, the commission plans to decide whether the proposals will go
before the voters in November.</TE>
<TE>   If that happens--and indications are that at least two and perhaps
all three of the proposals will make the ballot--it will be a day
that many did not see coming.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody ever thought secession had a prayer," said
county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who chairs the LAFCO board and
served as a Los Angeles city councilman for nearly 20 years starting
in 1975. "Nobody at City Hall did."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he believes city officials did take the concerns of
secessionists seriously, and responded by rewriting the City Charter
and creating the neighborhood council system.</TE>
<TE>   But the secession process, with its slow march toward the ballot,
was set in motion before the city began responding the dissatisfied
residents, the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the petitions were signed, it's inevitable that we are at
this point," he said. "You begin this inexorable LAFCO process....
You're headed toward having it on the ballot, even if people have a
change of heart.</TE>
<TE>   "That snowball keeps rolling down the mountain."</TE>

<HD>Rattlers Out of Hibernation, Public Gets a Wake-Up Call</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Officials warn homeowners and hikers to watch
their step. The snakes may be venturing farther from the wilderness
for water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hikers, spring cleaners and pet owners in Ventura County, beware:
Rattlesnakes are on the move.</LD>
<LD>   With protection of people, pets and the poisonous snakes as their
goal, county fire and animal control officials are warning residents
to be alert for the striped rattler with the triangular head and
venomous bite.</LD>
<LD>   "They are looking for water and they are looking for cool places,"
said Sandi Wells, spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire Department.
"You just don't want to startle them. That could cause them to
strike. Be respectful of the fact that there is a probability they
are there."</LD>
<TE>   Warnings about the snakes' rise from hibernation are a rite of
April in Ventura County, but this year residents and hikers need to
take extra care when venturing outdoors, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of rainfall for Ventura County--70% less than normal for
many locations-- means the snakes could venture farther from the wild
in search of water.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been seeing them in Ojai for the last month or so," said
Kathy Jenks, director of the Ventura County Department of Animal
Regulation. "But when you live in Ojai you get used to them. They
aren't looking to hurt us."</TE>
<TE>   No snakebites have been reported in Ventura County this year.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, a Thousand Oaks man was bitten after grabbing a
rattler on a neighbor's driveway and trying to fling it away. In
January 2001, a 9-year-old Westlake Village boy was bitten while
retrieving a ball from the brush.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, the return of the snakes from hibernation would only be
bad news for rats, gophers and rabbits, said Patrick Musone, a senior
field officer for the Department of Animal Regulation.</TE>
<TE>   But in Ventura County, with its miles of hiking trails and homes
backing up to open land, rodents aren't the only ones at risk, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Musone said people hiking in the county's hills should be
cautious, but not afraid of southern Pacific rattlers, which are the
only poisonous snakes native to the area.</TE>
<TE>   "If they are out there, then avoid them," Musone said. "But you
need to know you will most likely see them, and they are very
important to the environment."</TE>
<TE>   Musone said the rattlers are the chief predator of small rodents.
He recommended wearing loose-fitting long pants and hiking boots when
on trails and, whenever possible, hiking with a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Animal experts say the rattlesnake will not strike unless
provoked. To avoid attracting the rattlers to buildings, experts
recommend that homeowners repair leaky outdoor faucets that draw
thirsty snakes and store trash under tight-fitting lids.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't touch [the snake] or go after it," said Wells of the county
Fire Department. "Call us or call the animal regulation department."</TE>

<HD>Bus Drivers' Strike Likely to Continue</HD>
<DH>Labor: Negotiators for the union will urge its members to
reject latest contract offer from firm. No new talks are set.</DH>

<LD>The school bus strike that has disrupted service for thousands of Los
Angeles children is likely to continue this week, after union
negotiators rejected a three-year contract offer Saturday, the
drivers' union said.</LD>
<LD>   Union negotiators plan to recommend that the 842 striking school
bus drivers reject the three-year contract on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The offer made by Laidlaw Education Services, the Los Angeles
Unified School District's main transportation contractor, does not
address the health and welfare concerns of the drivers, said Rick
Middleton, the head of Teamsters Union Local 572.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an offer that needs to be rejected to get it off the table,"
Middleton said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the union wants a contract that raises wages for all
drivers based on their tenure and covers a greater percentage of
health-care costs for them and their families.</TE>
<TE>   A Laidlaw representative could not be reached Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Labor talks between the union and the bus contractor resumed
Friday before a federal mediator in Glendale and ended early Saturday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   Middleton said he plans to present Laidlaw with a new package by
Thursday, and hopes negotiations will resume by the end of the week.</TE>
<TE>   The school bus strike, the first in Los Angeles in at least three
decades, followed several months of haggling between the Teamsters
and Laidlaw.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified, which has stayed out of the negotiations, assigned
its own drivers to ferry 20,000 schoolchildren on the 700 affected
Laidlaw routes, but the average delay has been nearly an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Field trips and sporting events also have been disrupted.</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw's drivers, who earn $8 to $15 an hour, have argued for
wages and benefits comparable to those given to bus drivers employed
by the school district, who make $13 to $24 hourly and are eligible
for district health coverage and state pension plans.</TE>
<TE>   Teamsters spokesman Don Owens said he would not discuss the
contract offer in detail.</TE>
<TE>   But he said it would increase hourly wages for all of Laidlaw's
drivers, and the raises would be retroactive to August 2001. New
hires would be eligible for health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "They had received wage increases in the past," Owens said, "but
one or two trips to the doctor ... and the wage increases went out
the window."</TE>

<HD>Elite Female Navigators Quietly Made WAVES</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Behind the U.S. Navy's World War II flyboys was a small band of women
whose wing-and-a-prayer contribution to the war effort never made
history books.</LD>
<LD>   Almost 60 years ago, an elite group of WAVES--Women Accepted in
Volunteer Emergency Services--charted a new course in air navigation
and opened doors for other women into a male-dominated branch of the
service.</LD>
<LD>   These were the women--80 airborne, hundreds more on the
ground--who served as stateside navigators, training male pilots in
navigational skills and sometimes even riding shotgun on domestic
military flights. They were the forebears of the Navy women who today
fly as "top gun" pilots.</LD>
<TE>   The Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, ignited a
war in the Pacific that changed the world. It also brought to Los
Angeles' Terminal Island a new kind of Navy navigator.</TE>
<TE>   To free up men to serve at sea, thousands of women joined the Navy
in the newly organized women's unit called WAVES, and a few thousand
more enlisted in the Coast Guard's new SPAR women's units, short for
Semper Paratus, "Always Ready."</TE>
<TE>   Of those, 25,000 WAVES and 1,900 SPARs became part of naval
aviation in jobs as mechanics, air traffic controllers, and radio and
air navigators. About 200 of them worked at Terminal Island.</TE>
<TE>   Only 80 female navigators, some of whom were already private
pilots, were sent for further training: 50 flight hours in
twin-engine military planes. That earned them prized gold wings as
the nation's first female military personnel to share noncombat
flight duties with men.</TE>
<TE>   Before World War II, only wartime emergencies brought women into
military work, and then only in a limited capacity. Female volunteers
had participated in every war involving American men, and formalizing
their participation started to take shape in 1901 and 1908 with
creation of the Army and Navy nurse corps.</TE>
<TE>   In 1942, things changed. Joy Bright Hancock, a civilian pilot who
had been a Navy yeoman in World War I, pressured the government to
create the Navy WAVES and open up the field of navigation and related
jobs to women, both on the ground and in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock was later promoted to captain and named director of the
WAVES, making her the highest-ranking Navy woman, a distinction she
retained for years.</TE>
<TE>   To boost enlistments among women, Eleanor Roosevelt arranged for
the American-born couturier Mainbocher--birth name Main Rousseau
Bocher--to design uniforms for WAVES and SPARs. His prior experience
included introducing the strapless evening dress in 1934.</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, Marian Davis Skidmore and Marjorie Law Beringer were
21-year-old UCLA graduates when they and six other women joined the
Navy and then, in Navy uniform, became the first female radio
navigators assigned to Reeves Field, a military airfield on Terminal
Island.</TE>
<TE>   Skidmore and Beringer had just finished naval boot camp at New
York City's Hunter College, where they earned high marks in math and
were among the first women selected to attend the Naval Air
Navigation School in Atlanta. The 10-week radio navigation
course--known as "coming in on the beam"--was tough. Those who did
not maintain a 3.2 average were tossed out of the school. Trainees
studied meteorology, drew weather maps, learned temperature drops and
forecasts. They navigated and charted hypothetical four-hour flights
over the Pacific, learned Morse code and how to use basic instruments
such as a compass, altimeter, tachometer and turn-and-back
indicators.</TE>
<TE>   They wangled sea duty in the Pacific, Skidmore recalled
sardonically--which meant "riding the San Pedro Ferry back and forth
across the harbor" to a "glamour hot spot" on Terminal Island, "the
best duty of any WAVES radio navigators."</TE>
<TE>   Reeves Field was known as the "Hollywood Country Club" because its
wartime residents included such actors as Robert Taylor and Charles
"Buddy" Rogers, who was married to Mary Pickford, as well as actress
Norma Shearer's husband, ski instructor and Navy aviator Lt. Martin
Arrouge.</TE>
<TE>   Since wartime gas rationing limited driving, Rogers rode a
motorcycle to the field, while Skidmore and the others hopped on the
Pacific Electric trolley downtown for the ride to San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   WAVES seldom had to walk the last mile from the drop-off point to
the gate. If Marines patrolling the area in Jeeps didn't happen by to
give them a ride, they took a four-bit taxi ride, piling in eight to
a car, WAVES sitting on sailors' laps.</TE>
<TE>   Terminal Island was one of the first islands seized from Japanese
American fishermen and cannery workers shortly after Pearl Harbor was
attacked. Its commander was Capt. Kneflar "Socko" McGinnis, who had
won the Navy Cross for transporting the first mass flight of
seaplanes from Northern California to Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "He ran a good station," recalled Skidmore, who along with
Beringer still lives in Rancho Palos Verdes, not far from their old
posting. "He was strict but fair, and you always knew where you stood
with him. If men showed up for inspection in tailor-made uniforms
they'd purchased in the Far East [with silk jacket linings, zippers
and tight-fitting pants] instead of their GI-issue uniform, McGinnis
had the tailor-made clothes collected and burned."</TE>
<TE>   Day and night, hundreds of new planes roared in and out of Reeves
Field, one of the busiest naval ferrying air stations on the West
Coast. Planes just off assembly lines were flight-tested and then
"pickled" with a protective coating against the salt air before they
were shipped to the South Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   But not all went smoothly. Seasoned pilots who had served in the
South Pacific and were now assigned stateside, and pilots too old for
overseas assignments, resented having to learn radio navigation
procedures from WAVES. They especially objected to WAVES evaluating
their flying skills.</TE>
<TE>   One of the 80 airborne WAVES, Betty Turbiville, was navigating on
a training mission over the Pacific. The young male navigator she was
teaching insisted that his charts were right. If the pilot had
listened to him rather than to Turbiville, the plane would have run
out of fuel and crashed in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have anyone insult me for being in the service,"
Skidmore said. "But once a pilot unfairly reported one of the WAVES
who was bowlegged for not keeping her stocking seams straight."</TE>
<TE>   While the pilot in training sat in a mock-up training cockpit
wearing a headset, Skidmore sat at a desk just outside, also wearing
a headset, sending Morse code signals to the pilot, changing wind
speeds and charting his path on a map to see how well he could follow
the course changes. She reckons she trained hundreds of naval
navigators this way.</TE>
<TE>   On March 30, 1945, as the war neared its end, the Navy authorized
a distinctive gold wings insignia for the 80 airborne female
navigators, all of whom until then had worn a 1920s-design "observer"
wing with a compass in the center over crossed anchors.</TE>
<TE>   In their purses, these women carried copies of their orders
authorizing them to wear wings, because they were often stopped by
senior officers who pointed out that they weren't allowed to wear
their boyfriends' wings.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves Field was decommissioned in 1947 and eventually swallowed
up by harbor development.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, all women on active military duty, including WAVES, were
made an official part of the armed forces under the Women's Armed
Services Integration Act. Even so, women had to wait until 1967 for
the removal of restrictions on the rank that even career military
women could achieve.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating the contributions these women made to the war effort
and commemorating their 60th anniversary, the Los Angeles Maritime
Museum in San Pedro recently opened its newest exhibit, "WAVES and
SPARS: Navy and Coast Guard Women of World War II."</TE>
<TE>   The show, which runs through July, chronicles an extraordinary
group of women, some of whom earned the much-coveted U.S. Navy aerial
navigator's wings despite sentiments expressed by some enlisted men
that it would take "two women to do the work of one man."</TE>
<TE>   Women's contributions were noted contemporaneously as well. In
1944, the Navy estimated that the number of WAVES on duty that year
equaled the number of men it would have taken in peacetime to man 10
battleships, 10 aircraft carriers, 28 cruisers and 50 destroyers.</TE>

<HD>Eastwood's Tree Loses Title as Nation's Largest Hardwood</HD>
<DH>Nature: The actor's champion blue gum eucalyptus is
dethroned by another of the same species near Eureka.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It probably didn't make his day.</LD>
<LD>   Actor Clint Eastwood used to own the nation's largest known
hardwood tree, according to American Forests, a Washington,
D.C.-based nonprofit conservation organization that keeps track of
such things.</LD>
<LD>   But his champion tree was dethroned this year by a new champion
that took its place on the official National Register of Big Trees.</LD>
<TE>   A blue gum eucalyptus on Eastwood's Carmel property was named the
nation's largest hardwood in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   It was supplanted this year by another tree of the same species
discovered about 200 miles to the north along California's coast in
Petrolia, south of Eureka.</TE>
<TE>   The registry is revised every two years.</TE>
<TE>   The new champion is nearly 49 feet around and 141 feet tall, with
a 126-foot crown.</TE>
<TE>   That gives it a point total of 759 on American Forest's scale,
dwarfing Eastwood's 629-point tree.</TE>
<TE>   "We can only hope that 'the rookie' tree that committed this 'true
crime' for 'absolute power' does not go 'unforgiven,'" American
Forest magazine said, stretching to include some of Eastwood's movie
titles.</TE>
<TE>   Eastwood, a former mayor of Carmel, was named last year to the
California Parks and Recreation Commission.</TE>
<TE>   His publicist, Marco Barla, said he knew nothing about the
actor-director's tree and that Eastwood could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The General Sherman giant sequoia in California's Sequoia National
Park remains the nation's largest tree and the world's largest living
thing, according to American Forest, which has been keeping track of
champion trees since 1940.</TE>
<TE>   Among other new champions named this year is a 167-foot loblolly
pine in Congaree Swamp National Monument near Columbia, S.C., the
tallest big tree champion east of Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   A champion Pacific madrone in Humboldt County--known as the
Council Madrone for the many tribal councils held under its 121-foot
crown--was among the trees lost to high winds over the last two
years, the organization said.</TE>
<TE>   And it said a champion blue ash in Danville, Ky., was cut down by
a cleanup crew that was unaware of its importance and thought the
untidy tree was a nuisance to the surrounding park.</TE>
<TE>   The complete National Register of Big Trees, with a searchable
database, is available for the first time this year on the
organization's Web site at www. americanforests.org.</TE>

Dungan of Palmdale.</LD>
<LD>   Dungan was driving his Nissan Sentra east on the highway near the
Ventura County line Friday night when he lost control, swerved to the
side of the road and over-corrected, according to the California
Highway Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   The Sentra shot across the eastbound lanes into the westbound
lanes and struck a Toyota Camry driven by Lori Canfield, 48, of
Castaic, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Although he was wearing a seat belt, Dungan was ejected from his
car and died at the scene. Canfield and her passenger suffered minor

<HD>Yuji Hyakutake, 51; Amateur Discovered Giant Comet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It had not been seen in 10,000 years and isn't expected again for
14,000 more.</LD>
<LD>   But Jan. 30, 1996, the ball of ice and dirt the size of Chicago
revealed itself to an amateur astronomer named Yuji Hyakutake and
soon to the rest of the world.</LD>
<LD>   Hyakutake, for whom the International Astronomical Union named the
bright long-tailed object Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake, has died. He was
51.</LD>
<TE>   The photographer and photoengraver died Wednesday in Kokubu near
Kagoshima, Japan, of a heart attack brought on by a ruptured artery.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as though I own the thing, but it is flattering to have
such a big comet bear my name," the modest Hyakutake said after his
discovery rocketed him to international celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   The future discoverer became enchanted by astronomy in 1965, when
he saw the Ideya-Seki Comet as a teenager. But he graduated from an
industrial college and worked as a photoengraver for newspapers and
as a freelance photographer.</TE>
<TE>   Hyakutake became an amateur comet-hunter in 1989 but never seemed
to share the luck of other amateurs who discover many of the dozens
of comets seen each year. The trick is to spot a new comet before
competitors claim it as their own, but he never seemed to find
anything.</TE>
<TE>   He got so frustrated, he said six years ago during a visit to the
Midwest to observe his comet through powerful telescopes at the
University of Chicago's Yerkes Observatory, that he opted for another
hobby, mountain-climbing.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a passion for walking through the sky," he said through an
interpreter at a 1996 news conference in Chicago's Adler Planetarium.
"Then, my passion became walking through the mountains. Now, I walk
through the mountains and the sky."</TE>
<TE>   To escape big-city lights, which impede star-gazing, Hyakutake
moved to a mountainside in rural Kagoshima. Four nights a month, he
lugged his huge binoculars with front lenses the size of saucers 30
minutes higher up his mountain, and from 2 to 5 a.m. searched for
comets.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 26, 1995, he struck space dirt--his first comet, a small,
dim one he dubbed "Christmas Comet."</TE>
<TE>   A month later, he was back at his post to photograph his little
prize. Clouds obscured its location, however, so he looked elsewhere,
and there he found the comet that would put him in the astronomy
books.</TE>
<TE>   But even then, he almost missed out on the name and the fame.</TE>
<TE>   "I discovered Comet Hyakutake at 4:50 in the morning, and usually
a person can report a comet after 8 a.m.," he said. "But I decided to
take some photos of the comet, using my camera with telephoto lens,
and got them developed. It wasn't until 11 a.m. that I called the
National Astronomy Observatory in Tokyo to report my new comet."</TE>
<TE>   Two other amateur Japanese astronomers had also seen the comet,
and Hyakutake barely reported it ahead of them.</TE>
<TE>   The Hyakutake Comet attracted major notice from professional
astronomers and the public alike because of its enormous size, the
brilliance that made it resemble a star and its 62,000-mile-long
tail. Observable for two months, the comet even became visible to the
naked eye at its closest point to Earth--a mere 9.5 million
miles--which is an extremely rare phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   Hyakutake's achievement earned him a job as head of a municipal
astronomical observatory in Aira near his home. And he kept on
searching the skies, hunting more comets, until his death.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Shoko, and two sons.</TE>

<HD>Budget Remedies Could Hurt O.C.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVEN B. FRATES</AU>
<BD>Steven B. Frates is a fellow at the Rose Institute of
State and Local Government at Claremont McKenna College.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The looming state budget deficit does not augur well for Orange
County residents or the local governments that serve them.
Preliminary estimates indicate that the state's budget shortfall will
be at least $17 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Some observers, including the highly respected Legislative
Analyst's Office, indicate the budget deficit could even be in the
$24- to $25-billion range. Incredibly enough, the state has gone from
a budget surplus to a budget deficit in a few short years.</LD>
<LD>   There are many reasons for this looming budget crisis, but the
primary cause has been a Legislature that could not restrain itself
from spending the money that gushed into the state coffers during the
strong economy of the late 1990s. Examples of fiscal imprudence in
Sacramento abound.</LD>
<TE>   The huge increase in salary and benefits for state prison guards
is only the most recent example. Taxpayers writing checks to the
California Franchise Tax Board this evening might want to reflect on
the fact that state prison guards now make as much, or more than,
police officers or credentialed teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Prison guards need only have a high school education and minimal
training. Police officers must undergo rigorous training and of
course face criminals when they are not behind bars. Teachers need a
college degree, a credential and experience to pursue their
profession.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how you slice it, the governor and the Legislature are
in financial trouble. Clearly, they do not want to raise taxes until
after the election. So Californians can expect to see some financial
sleight of hand to conceal the budget shortfall until, say, the
second Wednesday in November.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the state was in a budget crisis, the Legislature
and then-governor gleefully gouged local governments. They took local
property tax revenues from cities and counties and gave some of it to
the schools, thereby reducing the amount of state revenue that went
to local education.</TE>
<TE>   Expect more of the same. Cities and counties are most vulnerable
to this tactic, but maybe this time the Legislature will be unable to
resist taking money from the cash-flush special districts. The Little
Hoover Commission report of May 2000 gave some idea of just how many
billions of dollars these special districts have sloshing around.</TE>
<TE>   But special districts in California, and especially water
districts, have jealously guarded their financial assets over the
years. They have successfully turned back attempts by the state
Legislature to get its hands on their money.</TE>
<TE>   Now, special districts, especially water districts, are furiously
designating dollars for capital improvement projects, thereby hiding
behind the fig leaf that such funds are "already committed." Their
tactic is encouraged by recent changes in government accounting
standards (the arcane but significant GASB 34 standard), which
sanctions local governments to develop cash reserves for capital
projects.</TE>
<TE>   What will the swirling political currents in Sacramento mean for
Orange County? The short answer is Orange County taxpayers had better
get a tight hold on their wallets.</TE>
<TE>   There are many things the Legislature might do to sidestep the
budget deficit problem that would potentially hurt Orange County. For
starters, the Legislature might change formulas for state funds going
to local governments. Orange County school districts, cities and the
county itself are already shortchanged by the state.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's legislative delegation has been spectacularly
ineffective in looking out for the interests of county schools and
cities. Orange County was getting less than other counties before the
huge increase in the state budget that occurred in the late 1990s.
The local legislative delegation couldn't even improve the financial
circumstances of Orange County schools and cities when times were fat
in Sacramento. Given their mediocre record, it doesn't seem likely
they will do any better in the current downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Another tactic the state Legislature is likely to employ is to
shift money to the general fund from various restricted funds, some
of which fund freeways, roads and capital projects. What this means
to Orange County residents is less state money for infrastructure
improvement, or higher taxes. There are more subtle but no less
painful ways in which the Legislature is hurting the Orange County
economy. For example, recent state legislative actions have resulted
in skyrocketing unemployment insurance costs.</TE>
<TE>   This sop to the trial lawyers and unions will directly suppress
the entrepreneurial activity and, hence, job creation, which is the
font of Orange County's comparatively healthy economy. The
Legislature is also on the verge of putting a series of
multibillion-dollar bond issues on future ballots. Orange County
taxpayers will surely pay a larger share of the taxes to finance
these bonds, and just as surely will get a smaller share of the
proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature's response to the state budget deficit is going to
hurt some Californians much more than others. Unfortunately, the
citizens of Orange County are probably going to bear a
disproportionate share of the pain.</TE>

<AU>RUSTY KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>Rusty Kennedy is executive director of the Orange
County Human Relations Commission and was a delegate to the United
Nations World Conference Against Racism, Xenophobia and Related
Intolerance.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's rapid growth in the 1950s and '60s was fueled in part
by a desire to escape the problems of the city. My parents left the
poverty, violence and congestion of South Central Los Angeles in 1952
for the middle-class dream of our own house on a quarter-acre lot in
Fullerton.</LD>
<LD>   By the '80s and '90s, many were escaping the congestion of central
Orange County for the gated communities of South County. This same
desire to withdraw behind barriers from the problems of the world is
evident in our nation in spite of its obvious short-range
effectiveness and profound consequences.</LD>
<LD>   A week before the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks
demonstrated our vulnerability as a country, the United Nations
convened the World Conference Against Racism. The United States
delegation walked out, in part because of a dispute over Israel.</LD>
<TE>   As the last remaining superpower, the United States also was
reluctant to compromise when issues such as reparations for slavery,
the evils of colonialism and globalization, and the Middle East
conflict took center stage.</TE>
<TE>   Three days after the conference in Durban, South Africa, was
concluded, the world was shaken by the most destructive terrorist
attack in history. That Sept. 11 attack gave us new motivation to
examine our international relationships and our need to work with
diverse governments and peoples, even when we don't get everything we
want. It showed us how small and interrelated our world really is.</TE>
<TE>   In Durban I learned that when it comes to racism, xenophobia and
related intolerance, many countries would rather find a reason to
back away from the table than look at their own transgressions.</TE>
<TE>   I heard the Indian ambassador condemn the thought of the United
Nations discussing the Hindu caste system as "totally inappropriate"
and akin to "social engineering." Yet I met a fine man who told me of
his life as a Dalit, or untouchable, and who is, by virtue of the
caste he is born into, forbidden even to step on the shadow of the
upper class. His only hope for equality is in his "next life," after
reincarnation.</TE>
<TE>   The ambassador to Mauritania invited me to his suite at the Hilton
to explain that, contrary to a "60 Minutes" report, there is no
slavery in his country. Later that day at lunch, the vice president
of the Mauritania Human Rights Commission told me that she knew the
ambassador and his family and that they had held slaves for many
generations.</TE>
<TE>   Many countries had issues that they didn't want discussed in front
of the whole world. China didn't want the oppression of the Tibetan
people and their religion discussed. The Europeans didn't want the
plight of the Roma (formerly known as Gypsy) children exposed. The
Pakistani government tried to keep the mention of hate and bigotry
toward gays and lesbians out of the official declaration of human
dignity. Just as the United States didn't want slavery declared a
crime against humanity and Israel didn't want their state criticized
for the plight of Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   So, trying to forge a worldwide consensus on a plan of action to
fight racism, xenophobia and related intolerance is an uphill battle.
Just as in a neighborhood dispute between officials and community
activists, the first thing on the agenda is the perceived injustices
committed years or even decades earlier. We learned it is hard to
move forward on the problems of the day until proper apologies are
uttered for yesterday.</TE>
<TE>   The tough thing for those of us who are the most privileged is
taking responsibility for acts that we benefited from but did not
commit. These are acts that systematically hurt and cheated others
but that ultimately formed the cornerstones of our affluence.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to understand and impossible to forgive the hateful
fury that resulted in the taking of thousands of innocent lives on
Sept. 11, but it is emblematic of the anger that many harbor against
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   If we are to fight effectively those who would foment such hate
toward us, the United Nations World Conference Against Racism is the
kind of forum we cannot afford to walk away from. It is in the
give-and-take process of consensus building in which we admit and
apologize for our mistakes of the past and partner with other nations
to visualize and plan a world where all people are safe, free and
treated with dignity.</TE>
<TE>   This must include Orange County, where we need to reach out across
our gates to our neighbors and see their suffering as our concern.</TE>
<TE>   As Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and chair of the
United Nations World Conference Against Racism, said in Durban,
"Civil society has gathered here to make human dignity and equality
not just hopes, but reality."</TE>

<HD>San Clemente in Danger of Being Railroaded</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Clemente currently has a single track running along its narrow,
eroding beach. Nearly 35 freight and passenger trains pass daily at
speeds of around 40 mph. Everyone realizes that this is an absurd
place to have a rail line, but we must remember it was built in 1888.
Back then, building the train tracks along the beach was the easiest
and smartest way to deal with the higher cost of engineering through
the hills and canyons of a then-desolate area.</LD>
<LD>   Things are different today. San Clemente has grown to 50,000
people. This unique surf-side community has 4.5 miles of rustic
natural beach, relatively unspoiled, except for the railroad
corridor. Our sandy beach is narrower now, our majestic bluffs more
fragile.</LD>
<LD>   Surfers cross the tracks as they have for years to reach the great
surf breaks that beckon. In addition, 2.3 million residents and
visitors now cross these tracks annually. Safety, while not a serious
issue in the past, has become so.</LD>
<TE>   A few years ago, we learned that double-tracking was being studied
for this rail corridor along with high-speed rail. Double-tracking
will not only further increase the number of trains significantly but
might increase speeds as well.</TE>
<TE>   Surfrider and DeRail the Trail were asked by the California High
Speed Rail Authority to become involved in proactive solutions and
dialogue. We emphatically stated that double-tracking on, under or
through our beach is totally unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   As high-speed rail gained momentum, San Clemente and other
stakeholders joined in opposition to the proposed beach alignment.
The rail authority appeared to be sympathetic to our concerns. They
consistently assured us that no at-grade options would be studied.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, a tunnel, which would not affect pedestrian access, the
environment or coastal aesthetics, would be considered.</TE>
<TE>   Consider our dismay when three of us from the city attended a rail
authority meeting in which they unveiled alternatives still under
consideration. In shock, we looked at San Clemente's options. There
were two--a tunnel under Interstate 5 that would cost more than $1
billion, feature a long construction time and include a steep incline
that would likely slow trains. The other option--an at-grade,
double-tracking route between the existing rail line and San
Clemente's fragile sandstone bluffs, except for a covered section
near the pier. Cheaper and easier. Hmm.</TE>
<TE>   Look out, surfers, families and beachgoers. You're about to get
railroaded into disaster. It would certainly be the destruction of
our beach town and our beach. Tunneling under Interstate 5 and
bypassing San Clemente's beach is a far superior alternative.</TE>

<HD>Drug Firms Target Arthritis Treatment</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>By the end of 1998, Jeanne Harrison thought she had lost a 20-year
battle with rheumatoid arthritis. Her wrists had fused and her right
elbow had locked at a 45-degree angle. She couldn't dress without
help from her husband.</LD>
<LD>   The medication she took to slow the disease, a powerful
chemotherapy drug called methotrexate, left her nauseated and tired.
It was painful to walk and to hug her two children.</LD>
<LD>   Then she started taking a drug called Enbrel and everything
changed. She can straighten her elbow and dress herself, and she no
longer is fatigued. The pain in her joints is gone.</LD>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, she enrolled in a jazz dance class near her home
in Westlake Village. "This medication has truly been a miracle drug
for me," said Harrison, 48.</TE>
<TE>   But Enbrel is no magic bullet. It does not work for everyone and
it is not a cure. To keep their disease in check, patients may have
to take the drug for the rest of their lives at a cost of $12,000 a
year. People who take the drug face an increased risk of infection,
and the effects of long-term use aren't known.</TE>
<TE>   For those reasons, doctors tend to prescribe Enbrel for patients
who have not been helped by standard therapies. Still, the drug
represents a breakthrough for patients and drug makers.</TE>
<TE>   Enbrel is among an emerging class of drugs that attack rheumatoid
arthritis on a molecular level. These drugs target specific proteins
that direct the assault on cartilage and bone. The new "targeted"
drugs appear to work in other chronic disorders that affect more than
8 million Americans, in addition to the 2.1 million people with
rheumatoid arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   That makes the business of rheumatoid arthritis treatment tempting
to drug makers. Enbrel's huge sales potential prompted Amgen Inc. to
pay $16 billion for Immunex Corp., which developed the drug. The
deal, announced in December, is expected to close this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen predicts that Enbrel's annual sales will more than quadruple
to $3 billion by 2005, driven in part by new uses for the drug. The
Food and Drug Administration has approved its use in psoriatic
arthritis. Immunex has been studying the drug as a treatment for
psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis, an arthritic condition that
causes the vertebrae to fuse.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen's immediate rival will be Centocor, the Johnson &amp; Johnson
unit that markets Remicade, a drug similar to Enbrel. The Centocor
drug is approved as a short-term treatment for Crohn's disease, a
chronic bowel inflammation that affects nearly 500,000 people in the
U.S. It also is approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis, and Centocor
is studying it as a treatment for ankylosing spondylitis.</TE>
<TE>   But a broader competition is underway among drug companies racing
to develop second-generation medications. The result for patients may
be drugs that not only are better but also cheaper. Scios Inc. is
testing a drug in clinical trials that it believes will be as good as
Enbrel but with fewer side effects. The Scios drug, Scio-469, is
cheaper to make than Enbrel and could cost 50% less.</TE>
<TE>   "Enbrel is a good drug, but we can avoid the side effects at a
significantly lower price," Scios Chief Executive Richard Brewer said
at a recent investment conference. "I think we will take the market."</TE>
<TE>   With at least a dozen drugs in various stages of testing, it is
too soon to say how the category will shake out. It is a safe bet
that some experimental medications won't make it out of the
laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   Still, industry executives say there is plenty of room for those
therapies that manage to reach the marketplace. Less than 6% of
rheumatoid arthritis patients use the targeted drugs, which, besides
Enbrel and Remicade, include Kineret, an Amgen medication approved in
November.</TE>
<TE>   An aging population will further expand the opportunity for drug
makers. Decision Resources, a market research firm, said the number
of Americans with rheumatoid arthritis will increase by 19% this
decade, to 2.8 million. The disease chiefly strikes people between
ages 40 and 60 and affects twice as many women as men.</TE>
<TE>   In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system attacks the
tissues that line and cushion the joints, eventually causing the
cartilage, bone and ligaments around the joints to erode. It also can
inflame the membranes around the lung and the sac around the heart.
The cause of the disease isn't known.</TE>
<TE>   Relief From Pain Worth the Risks</TE>
<TE>   The new medicines target proteins that orchestrate the immune
assault on joint tissue, thereby preventing further damage and
reducing inflammation. One protein, tumor necrosis factor--or
TNF--comes into play early, sending signals to cells in the immune
system like a molecular Paul Revere.</TE>
<TE>   Interleukin-1, a protein produced by cells in the connective
tissue, similarly rallies cells.</TE>
<TE>   Enbrel and Remicade work by binding to TNF molecules, so they
can't dock on cells and nudge them into attack mode. Enbrel, a
modified copy of the TNF receptor found on the surface of cells, acts
as a decoy for free-floating TNF molecules. Remicade is a
bioengineered antibody that latches onto TNF molecules and also plugs
the receptors.</TE>
<TE>   Kineret prevents interleukin-1 from docking on cells by plugging
the receptor for that molecule.</TE>
<TE>   But the signaling proteins, called cytokines, are not all bad.
They also prod the immune system to fight disease. Interleukin-1
fends off bacterial assault and causes fever. TNF can kill cancer
cells, at least in test tubes, and is believed to resist viral
invaders. Because the new drugs neutralize these cytokines, people
who use the medications face a greater risk of infection.</TE>
<TE>   To patients such as Richard Van Antwerp, who tried five
conventional drugs and such folk remedies as bee stings, relief from
pain is worth the risk. Before he started getting daily injections
with Kineret, Van Antwerp couldn't grasp a steering wheel. On some
mornings, he was so stiff that he stayed in bed. Now he splits logs
at his ranch near Yosemite National Park, where he is building a rail
fence.</TE>
<TE>   Kineret "restarted my life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But physicians worry about the long-term effects of powerful
immune suppressors. In August, after 84 patients developed
tuberculosis, Centocor warned that Remicade users face an increased
risk of the disease--three years after the FDA approved the drug. The
Enbrel label says there have been rare reports of multiple sclerosis.</TE>
<TE>   "These drugs are being positioned as something patients use
indefinitely," said Dr. Doyt Conn, director of allergy, immunology
and rheumatology at Emory University. "The drug companies want
patients to stay on the drugs forever. I really question that
strategy when we don't know what the effects will be."</TE>
<TE>   Physicians have relegated the new medications to the back of the
disease arsenal, at least for now. That is in part because there is
little evidence that these new biologics are more effective than a
standard course of methotrexate in treatment of early disease. And
methotrexate, a generic, has the advantage of being 85% cheaper than
Enbrel and other anti-cytokines.</TE>
<TE>   Drug makers are pushing their own slant on the price gap. A study
presented at a recent rheumatologists' convention asserted that
Remicade, which can cost $25,000 a year, is more "cost effective"
than methotrexate, with annual costs of $2,000, when "quality of
life" is considered. The research was funded by Schering-Plough
Corp., Centocor's marketing partner.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Centocor had on its Web site a work sheet that
helped doctors to compute profits per Medicare patient. Remicade is
the only rheumatoid arthritis drug covered by the government plan for
the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   Conn isn't convinced. "I don't think the cost benefit
[relationship] has been proven. We can't use drugs just because they
are there."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Bevra Hahn, chief of rheumatology at UCLA, said 40% of
patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis either don't respond to
methotrexate or stop taking it because the side effects--hair loss,
nausea and a risk of birth defects--become intolerable. For those
patients, she said, the new medicines "are a good addition to the
arsenal."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, few patients do as well on the new drugs as
Harrison. A large number of patients--40% to 60%--do not improve on
the anti-cytokines. Kineret offers the least benefit and Enbrel, the
most. That has set off a race among drug companies for better targets
and better drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a battle for efficacy," said Dr. Roger
Perlmutter, Amgen executive vice president for research and
development. "Everyone is looking for improved efficacy, I think. The
drugs we have today are not nearly good enough."</TE>
<TE>   The experimental Scios drug takes aim at an enzyme called p38. The
p38 enzyme awakens other molecules, triggering a chain reaction that
leads to excess production of TNF, interleukin-1 and a third
inflammatory protein, Cox-2. This molecular alarm is normally silent,
but not in people with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Scios Chief Scientific Officer Dr. George Schreiner said a drug
that blocks p38 should break the cycle that leads to bone tissue
destruction. But it shouldn't interrupt production of TNF and
interleukin-1 in amounts needed to fight infection. What's more, a
drug that blocks the p38 enzyme can take the form of a pill, which is
cheaper to manufacture than the anti-cytokines. The drug is in the
early stages of clinical testing, and it is too soon to predict
whether it will work. The p38 molecule belongs to a family of enzymes
with diverse functions, so a drug that inhibits a related enzyme
could cause serious side effects. Vertex Pharmaceuticals recently
dropped a p38 inhibitor because at high doses it caused nervous
system complications in animals.</TE>
<TE>   But such a medication has the potential to dramatically change the
rheumatoid arthritis drug market and siphon sales from existing
drugs, according to Decision Resources.</TE>
<TE>   Drug Makers Look for New Targets</TE>
<TE>   "It would be revolutionary," said Dr. Larry Moreland, a University
of Alabama-Birmingham immunologist who works closely with the
National Institutes of Health.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen also is looking at new targets, including p38 and specific
T-cells, white blood cells that function as foot soldiers in the
immune assault. But its chief focus is on developing better drugs
that block TNF and interleukin-1, targets its scientists understand
well. A team of Immunex scientists in the early 1990s was among the
first to realize that TNF, first studied as an anti-cancer agent,
could be useful as an immune modulator. Amgen is the first company to
market a drug that blocks interleukin-1.</TE>
<TE>   High on Amgen's list is an improved version of Kineret, whose
sales are expected to total $80million this year. By comparison,
Enbrel should break $1billion. Perlmutter wants to develop a more
convenient interleukin-1 blocker that can be taken weekly instead of
daily.</TE>
<TE>   More important, he wants to offer a version that can be safely
used with Enbrel. Currently, patients who combine Kineret with a TNF
blocker face a threefold risk of serious infection. If Amgen can
reduce the hazard, it can sell more medicine while offering patients
a potent combination therapy. Kineret costs $11,000 annually.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen also must work out the kinks in Enbrel production. Immunex
expects to open a $500-million factory this year in Rhode Island that
should alleviate a chronic shortage of Enbrel. The situation got so
bad in December that Immunex stopped supplying new patients and
recently warned that 60,000 Enbrel users may face delays getting
their prescriptions filled. The shortage should ease by June.</TE>
<TE>   Patients soon will have more choices. In the next two years,
analysts said, Abbott Laboratories and Pharmacia Corp. will launch
injectable TNF blockers that last longer than Enbrel and cost less
than Enbrel and Remicade. Their arrival should ignite a marketing war
in a disease category long dominated by generics.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott's D2E7, the drug furthest along, doesn't work much better
than Enbrel. But lower prices--Decision Resources forecasts a 15%
discount--would be good news for patients, who have seen their drug
expenditures soar overall. Abbott hasn't commented on price. If the
market leaders are worried about the next round of competition, they
aren't saying. Immunex Chief Operating Officer Peggy Phillips
predicts that sales of medications that target tumor necrosis factor
alone will reach $10 billion by 2005, leaving plenty of room for new
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "If they can supply the market, they can sell it," said Scott
Habig, Centocor marketing vice president. "That's true for all of us.
These are very big markets."</TE>

<DH>The world's growing appetite for seafood and the depletion
of ocean fisheries have fueled a surge in aquaculture--and concerns
about food safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cindy Fernandez assumed that the Atlantic salmon she bought at her
neighborhood supermarket came from fishing boats off the East Coast.
She was surprised to learn it was farmed, grown in pens off the
Chilean and Canadian coastlines.</LD>
<LD>   The word "farmed" never appeared on signs or labels with the
farm-raised salmon, trout, catfish and shrimp at the grocery.</LD>
<LD>   "I would never have known," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Aquaculture's meteoric growth in the last decade has been
invisible to most consumers because supermarkets rarely label farmed
seafood and chefs are reluctant to add the word "farmed" to their
chalkboard menus fearing consumers will balk.</TE>
<TE>   But the world's growing appetite for seafood, the depletion of
ocean fisheries and the generally good quality and low cost of
farm-raised fish have fueled a surge in farmed fare.</TE>
<TE>   Globally, aquaculture's haul has more than doubled in the last
decade to 35.6 million tons a year, and small-scale, U.S. aquaculture
production hasgrown more than 40% since 1991, according to the United
Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Farmed seafood makes up about a third of the seafood consumed in
the U.S. More than 60% of the salmon, virtually all of the catfish
and trout, and two-thirds of the shrimp consumed by Americans are
raised in ponds, tanks and pens.</TE>
<TE>   And if Americans keep consuming seafood at the current rate--15
pounds per capita each year--by 2025 the U.S. will need an additional
1 billion pounds of farmed production to meet demand, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Like it or not, we need aquaculture. The wild supply is just not
going to give us enough," said Howard Johnson, a seafood consultant
in Jacksonville, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   But as the volume of farmed fish has grown, so have concerns about
its safety from environmentalists and consumer activists. They say
the federal government can't adequately oversee the fragmented
industry and ensure the safety of farmed fish--a charge that
regulators deny.</TE>
<TE>   Limits on chemicals and antibiotics used in raising farmed fish
and preventing disease are not rigorously enforced, activists say.
Gaps in federal inspection allow imported fish--which have been dosed
with drugs, herbicides and pesticides--to enter U.S. ports, they add.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency in charge of
seafood safety, tests only a very small percentage of imported prawns
and other seafood, and only for certain drugs, said Rebecca J.
Goldburg, a scientist with Environmental Defense who was a co-author
of a report on aquaculture last year.</TE>
<TE>   Inspection should be increased, experts say, and consumers should
have more information about what they're buying.</TE>
<TE>   Some Consumers Prefer Farmed Seafood</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) is proposing a provision to the U.S.
farm bill that would require more information on labels about the
origin of seafood, including whether it was farmed or caught wild.</TE>
<TE>   Although Stevens' intent is to bolster sales of wild fish, there
are many consumers who knowingly choose farmed seafood.</TE>
<TE>   With farmed fish, "at least you know where it's been and what it's
been fed," said Nelson D'Angelo, a culinary student who was shopping
recently at a Los Angeles Albertsons. "It's cheaper, it's cleaner and
it's tastier."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Massingill, executive vice president of Kent SeaTech Corp.
in San Diego, one of the nation's largest fish farms, said that in
blind taste tests most people can't distinguish between wild-caught
striped bass and the farmed bass Kent produces at its tank farm in
Mecca, east of San Diego at the tip of the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fish has more oil content and even higher omega-3 acids
because the feed has higher fish oils than a wild fish gets,"
Massingill said. "I think it has more flavor, but I don't think the
average person could tell them apart."</TE>
<TE>   Kent produces 3.5 million pounds of striped bass a year--a third
of the nation's production. It is one of the largest of California's
120 farms, which also raise catfish, abalone, mussels and sturgeon.
Other leading farmed-fish-producing states are Mississippi, Florida,
Arkansas and Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   Kent is as much fish factory as farm; everything from the feed to
the water temperature is calculated to deliver the perfect 1
1/2-pound to 2-pound whole fish to white-tablecloth restaurants and
seafood markets in 18 months--half the time a wild bass would take to
reach that size.</TE>
<TE>   Computer models track the growth of its fish, electronic equipment
dispenses food four times a day and an elaborate waste water system
recirculates 25,000 gallons of water each minute.</TE>
<TE>   It's a large and highly efficient operation, yet it has trouble
competing with seafood shipped in from around the globe, Massingill
said. Imported seafood has been declining in price and accounts for
about two-thirds of the seafood on Americans' plates.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon fillets from Chile, for instance, which in 1995 cost
retailers $3.34 a pound, dropped to $2.17 last year, according to
data firm Urner Barry. That allows Albertsons and other retailers to
offer bigger discounts.</TE>
<TE>   To compete, Kent and other U.S. fish farms are constantly striving
to cut costs and become more efficient.</TE>
<TE>   "Seafood is different from other meat choices in that we have so
many options," Massingill said. "All of our customers say, 'If the
prices go down, we'll buy a lot more.'"</TE>
<TE>   But shaving 25 cents off the $2.50 per pound Massingill charges
wholesalers is no mean feat.</TE>
<TE>   Water and labor are more expensive in California than in most
other producing regions. And U.S. fish farms are subject to more
regulation than some competitors in places such as South America and
Southeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it's the lack of scrutiny of imported seafood that worries
scientists and consumer groups. They say that many farms in other
countries operate with few health and environmental restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Although foreign fish farms are required to abide by U.S. limits
for antibiotics, herbicides and pesticides if they ship here,
industry analysts say they often use drugs banned in the U.S. or use
approved drugs in much higher amounts.</TE>
<TE>   In two small surveys, toxicologist Miriam Jacobs of the University
of Surrey in England found residues of PCBs, pesticides and flame
retardants in much of the 15 farm-raised salmon from Scotland she
sampled.</TE>
<TE>   Farms in Chile, the world's second-largest salmon-producing nation
after Norway, have been accused by several groups of dosing fish with
large amounts of antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   And more than 200 tons of farmed Chinese shrimp were shipped back
from Europe last year after they were found to be laced with
chloramphenicol, a potent antibiotic that can disrupt blood cell
production in humans.</TE>
<TE>   Just last month, shrimp imported from Thailand were found by
European Union agriculture officials to contain traces of the banned
antibiotic nitrofuran.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns About Antibiotics, Chemicals</TE>
<TE>   Since these findings, the EU has begun testing 100% of shrimp
coming from Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some unsafe practices being used," Environmental
Defense scientist Goldburg said. "And my concerns are greatest about
seafood produced in developing countries."</TE>
<TE>   The General Accounting Office said in a report issued last year
that products barred elsewhere could be winding up in U.S.
supermarkets, because FDA inspectors look at less than 1% of the food
coming in at the ports and because they inspect overseas plants so
infrequently.</TE>
<TE>   No outbreaks or cases of illness from antibiotics or chemicals in
seafood have been reported in the United States, said Brett Koonse,
director of the FDA's seafood enforcement division. He said the FDA's
inspection system is effective at catching most offenders here and
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Although the agency doesn't inspect every shipment, he said, the
FDA carefully selects and samples seafood from companies with a
history of problems and from rumored offenders.</TE>
<TE>   If the agency finds contaminants or anything that might pose a
health risk, it issues an alert banning the product until the company
can prove its products are safe.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been doing this for a long time," Koonse said. "If we
know a country or a product is having a problem, we'll target it" for
inspection.</TE>
<TE>   One potential gap in the process: The FDA doesn't inspect U.S.
fish farms in the same way it does meat and poultry operations.</TE>
<TE>   Instead the agency goes out to processors and warehouses every few
years on average. It requires these firms to test occasionally for
antibiotics and other chemicals, and show that they are keeping
products in a clean environment at the right temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, U.S. fish farmers use antibiotics far less than do
their poultry and pork counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   FDA officials say that at the mandated levels, antibiotics do not
leave a residue in the fish that could trigger problems.</TE>
<TE>   But environmental and consumer groups say they are concerned about
routine antibiotic use, especially given the limited oversight of the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   There also are serious environmental questions about the
unprecedented growth of fish farming.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is intended to protect most native fish populations,
scientists say farming is beginning to put a dent in some smaller
species, such as herring, sardines, mackerel and other fish used to
make fish feed. Two pounds of this meal is needed to grow a 1-pound
farmed fish.</TE>
<TE>   And analysts say that if farmers don't reduce their dependence on
fish meal and search for other sources of protein such as soy, they
will in effect be taking away food from other wild fish, cutting
their numbers.</TE>
<TE>   The construction of shrimp and salmon farms along coastlines in
Southeast Asia and Chile have taken habitat away from native fish
populations and brought large amounts of waste runoff, said Jennifer
Dianto, manager of the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program,
which identifies sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices.</TE>
<TE>   She and others say most U.S. farms are following health and
environmental rules because it's more expensive not to. And
Massingill said that In addition to being illegal, dosing fish with
large volumes of antibiotic-laced feed would be too expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Using and dumping lots of waste has its costs too.</TE>
<TE>   Kent came up with its own waste water treatment and recirculation
system so it could slash its water costs and sell some of its water
to nearby farms.</TE>
<TE>   It's not an appetizing process. But it is effective, analysts say,
and ultimately it may serve as a model for other farms.</TE>
<TE>   First, water leading from its 98 tanks is pumped into a channel
where thousands of live carp and tilapia--which later will be sold
live in Asian American fish markets--eat much of the feces and other
solid waste.</TE>
<TE>   The water then passes through filters and a pond with tiny
floating plastic rings that grab bacteria and convert it into
nitrate, which isn't toxic.</TE>
<TE>   It's then pumped out to constructed wetlands and back for use at
Kent and other farms nearby.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, said Tom Levy, general manager of the Coachella
Valley Water District, "it's pretty clean waste water"--cleaner, in
fact, than most treated municipal water.</TE>
<TE>   Because fish farming is a newer and smaller industry than meat and
poultry enterprises, farmers such as Kent don't have much of a rule
book to play by.</TE>
<TE>   No federal rules govern how these farms must dispose of their
waste. Yet Massingill and others in private industry keep tweaking
their operations, seeking cleaner, cheaper ways of raising fish.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a state-of-the-art farm in the U.S., but in our minds
there are some things here that are now obsolete," said Massingill,
looking out over the racetrack-sized prototype for its next tank.
"We'll change that on our next farm."</TE>

<HD>Global Pressured Employees to Make Campaign Donations</HD>
<DH>Fund-raising: Telecom giant's tactics included letters and
visits from the co-chairman's daughter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS and KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Global Crossing Ltd. grew from a telecom pipsqueak into a
$55-billion fiber-optic giant, company executives sought to gain
influence in Washington by showering millions of dollars around the
Capitol.</LD>
<LD>   But with Congress deepening its investigations of the company's
business and accounting practices, it is becoming increasingly clear
that Global Crossing was far more adept at wringing campaign
contributions from employees than it was at disbursing the cash in a
politically advantageous way.</LD>
<LD>   Using a combination of persistence and intimidation, Global
Crossing's leaders persuaded employees to pour $3.6 million into
Beltway coffers, including $2.8 million in the 1999-2000 election
cycle. That placed the company 23rd on the list of top donors to
national political parties, candidates for federal offices and
political action committees, said the Center for Responsive Politics,
a watchdog group based in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   Global Crossing Chairman Gary Winnick personally has contributed
more than $300,000 since founding the company in 1997. The funds went
to causes and candidates across the political spectrum, from liberal
icon Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) to conservative Senate Minority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, an extravagant financier who spent at least $60 million
on a Beverly Hills estate and adjoining property and has pledged more
than $100 million to charity, wasn't the only active political donor
at the company. Altogether, 78 Global Crossing executives contributed
to Republicans and Democrats during the 1999-2000 election cycle.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody had to make contributions," said a former Global
Crossing executive who was frequently badgered for donations. "You
were permitted to say no, but they expected you to give money."</TE>
<TE>   Several former executives and employees agreed to talk about the
internal fund-raising efforts, but they did not want to be named
because they are bound by confidentiality agreements or fear
retribution.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing spokeswoman Becky Yeamans said that although
senior company executives believe that "participating in the
political process" is part of being a "good corporate citizen,"
employees were not pressured to contribute.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision to support any candidate by individual employees of
Global Crossing is entirely voluntary and unrelated to employment,"
Yeamans said.</TE>
<TE>   The company and its political action committee together have
contributed more than $1.3 million to federal political causes alone
since 1997, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which
bases its numbers on federal filings.</TE>
<TE>   More than $150,000 also flowed to Washington from Global Crossing
employees through Pacific Capital Group, the private investment firm
run by Winnick that shared Beverly Hills office space with Global
Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Bermuda-based Global Crossing, which operates a global
telecommunications network, has been under scrutiny since it filed
the nation's fourth-largest bankruptcy in late January. The company's
accounting and other practices are under investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   The money-raising machine was simple but effective. Target
candidates and causes were handpicked at the highest levels of the
company, typically by Winnick, Global Crossing Co-Chairman Lodwrick
Cook or former board member Norman Brownstein, a political
fund-raiser and longtime friend of Winnick.</TE>
<TE>   When money was needed, a note would be dispatched to a select
group of employees, usually managers with relatively high salaries.
"There was always a specific amount needed," according to a person
familiar with the practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, a memo would come out and say, 'We like this person,
and this person is a good person, and we should support their
campaign. We would like you to contribute,'" said another former
executive. "People would say, 'Can I come and pick up the check?'"</TE>
<TE>   Some executives succeeded in skirting the appeals, but it took
guts. The letters usually included the phrase "Gary would like you to
... " or something similar, and they often were seen as a request
directly from the top of the company. Only a few people, including
Executive Vice President of Finance Joseph Perrone, made a habit of
resisting the entreaties, the sources said. Perrone did not return a
call for comment.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't easy. Workers who tried to ignore the memos were visited
by Lodwrick Cook's daughter, Sherri Cook, a Global Crossing attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "Sherri would go into their office and talk to them," said a
person familiar with the practice. "When Sherri Cook came into your
office, she wasn't just someone asking for a donation. She was Lod
Cook's daughter."</TE>
<TE>   Lodwrick Cook and a spokesman for Winnick did not return calls
seeking comment. Sherri Cook said she did not pressure anyone to make
campaign contributions. "I believe it's my duty as a good citizen to
educate others about our political process, so that they can exercise
their freedom of choice, and I've been faithful to that duty," she
said. "In so doing, I've always taken great pains to make sure that
none of my friends or colleagues felt pressure to contribute to a
campaign that I supported."</TE>
<TE>   Unless an executive explicitly tells employees that they "must"
contribute to a political cause, solicitations such as those at
Global Crossing are legal, said Larry Noble, executive director of
the Center for Responsive Politics and a former general counsel for
the Federal Election Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Often the executives will say, 'It's in the interest of the
company that we support these candidates,'" Noble said.</TE>
<TE>   A case involving the Machinists Nonpartisan Political League
challenged such statements as being inherently coercive. But the
election commission dismissed the union's case and the federal courts
upheld the decision, agreeing that the solicitations are allowable
because employee contributions are voluntary.</TE>
<TE>   It is illegal for companies to punish workers for failing to give
money to favored politicians, but such cases are almost impossible
for employees to prove, said another election law expert in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The conduct would have to be egregious," he said. "It's very
difficult, unless you have a smoking gun."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing executives often sought contributions from
employees who they knew recently had cashed in profitable stock
options. In those cases, the requests contained overtones of a quid
pro quo.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like, 'Hey, you've made all this money on stock options,
and now it's time to give back, and Gary would like you to contribute
to this person,'" said a person aware of the practice. "If Gary
Winnick is the person who made you so much money, you aren't going to
say no, or your career is over."</TE>
<TE>   One former company executive stressed that it was possible to
refuse the requests. "But it's easier to say yes.... You had to give
to Gary's charities and you had to give to politicians or you're not
really a ballplayer," the person said.</TE>
<TE>   Company spokeswoman Yeamans denied that the company kept track of
contributions by employees.</TE>
<TE>   "Saying there was intimidation or some kind of quid pro quo is
really ludicrous," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some employees presumably gave of their own volition. Former Chief
Executive Leo Hindery Jr., for example, is by far the top Global
Crossing giver primarily because of his longtime generosity to the
Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a substantial contributor to the Democratic Party and
Democratic causes long before my brief tenure with Global Crossing,
and I continue to be now," Hindery said. He added that he "did not
lobby or seek political influence of any sort on behalf of Global
Crossing and never would have."</TE>
<TE>   Gifts to Both Parties</TE>
<TE>   But in many cases, the pattern of giving ran counter to party
affiliation.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Sheh, a registered Republican now retired from Global
Crossing, gave a combined $2,500 to Democratic Sens. Joseph
Lieberman, Dianne Feinstein and Bob Kerrey while simultaneously
writing checks totaling $10,000 to GOP candidates. Fellow Republican
David L. Lee, a company co-founder and former president, contributed
$5,000 to the Committee for a Democratic Majority despite giving more
than $80,000 to the Republican National Committee and the Republican
Party of California. Lee did not respond to a request for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Sheh downplayed his party-switching donations, saying his
political giving is rarely based on party affiliation. He added, "I
certainly didn't have my arm twisted" to make those contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently, contributions from many employees were bundled to
multiply their political effect. On a single day in June 1999, 24
Global Crossing employees wrote checks totaling $24,000 to
presidential candidate George W. Bush. Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.)
received $19,500 from a group of 22 Global Crossing workers on Dec.
21, 1999, and Feinstein collected $13,500 from 11 employees on March
7, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   New campaign finance laws that will take effect after the November
elections will allow individuals to contribute up to $2,000 per
candidate each election cycle, with an overall cap of $25,000. But
companies won't be able to contribute so-called soft money to
national political parties. That might make companies such as Global
Crossing more dependent on bundled contributions from employees,
Noble said.</TE>
<TE>   One former Global Crossing executive agreed with that assessment.
With the higher limit for individual donations, he said, "What Global
did ... it's just going to be worse."</TE>
<TE>   For all its prodigious giving, Global Crossing appears to have
reaped few benefits. Especially when compared with the legendary
lobbying of its telecommunications brethren AT&amp;T Corp., Verizon
Communications Inc. and SBC Communications Inc., Global Crossing made
few visible demands of politicians.</TE>
<TE>   "Global Crossing [executives] never asked for anything; they had
no agenda," said a former company executive. "At least Enron was
getting loopholes, they were getting tax breaks. With Global
Crossing, it seemed like it was more just to enhance the prestige of
some of its big shots."</TE>
<TE>   And that it did. In addition to gaining entree to exclusive
functions, the company frequently landed appearances or taped
accolades by political heavy-hitters--among them former Presidents
George Bush and Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Gov. Gray Davis--for Global Crossing events and dinners
honoring Winnick.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's biggest push for federal action came in early
1999, shortly after AT&amp;T, Sprint Corp., WorldCom Inc. and more than
25 other phone companies teamed up to build a fiber link between the
United States and Japan. Global Crossing complained that the
consortium violated antitrust laws and that its extensive roster of
investors was designed to control critical cable landing sites and
soak up potential customers for Global Crossing's rival system.</TE>
<TE>   To press its case with the Clinton administration, Global Crossing
hired high-powered lobbyists, including former Clinton antitrust
chief Anne Bingaman. The Justice Department and the Federal
Communications Commission agreed to investigate the complaint. Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.), then chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, sent a letter to the FCC underscoring the need for an open
market in the undersea cable business.</TE>
<TE>   McCain's May 1999 letter did not mention Global Crossing
specifically. But it was written one month after McCain received
$14,000 in campaign contributions from Global Crossing employees.
McCain became the top recipient of Global Crossing funds in Congress,
collecting $31,000.</TE>
<TE>   In a February speech in Los Angeles, McCain said he had been
"tainted" by the Global Crossing contributions, which represent an
added embarrassment because of McCain's vigorous push for campaign
finance reform. McCain said he expects the Senate Commerce Committee
to take up the controversies surrounding Global Crossing when its
Enron Corp. proceedings are completed.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Global Crossing's efforts at the FCC, the rival undersea
cable project won approval in November 1999. But the lobbying effort
nonetheless benefited the company by delaying the competition, giving
Global Crossing a several-month lead in construction.</TE>
<TE>   Lobbying Efforts</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the company pressed federal officials for a favorable
outcome in a long-running dispute between the FCC and NextWave
Telecom Inc. over valuable wireless licenses. Global Crossing and
Winnick's investment firm planned to make a large investment in the
bankrupt firm if it regained the licenses.</TE>
<TE>   After a key settlement fell through, the license battle has moved
to the Supreme Court, and Winnick's companies are no longer involved.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, two senators who have collected Global Crossing
contributions--Lott ($15,000) and Louisiana Democratic Sen. John
Breaux ($1,000)--wrote letters to federal officials questioning the
fairness of its system for assessing permit fees for underwater
fiber-optic cables. Global Crossing has been fighting a $7.2-million
fee by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which
previously had exacted for the same project nearly $12 million for
marine mitigation, monitoring and visitor center construction,
according to a company filing.</TE>
<TE>   Funds raised by Global Crossing employees also were used to
sponsor an event hosted by the Communications Workers of America in
an effort to curry favor with the union and win its support for the
company's takeover of phone company Frontier Corp., according to a
person familiar with the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Our contributions were not and are not contingent upon the
receipt of any special action, favor or treatment by any government
official," Global Crossing spokeswoman Yeamans said.</TE>
<TE>   But for the most part, the money wrung out of Global Crossing
employees seemed to have no specific political, legislative or
regulatory purpose. That was just fine with the politicians, who
collected the funds and didn't have to spend any political capital in
return.</TE>
<TE>   "All they'd have to say was, 'We're in favor of competition in
telecommunications,'" said a former executive. "Global Crossing was
not a monopolist. It was a new company with new technologies, and it
didn't come with any baggage."</TE>
<TE>   At least, not until recently.</TE>

<HD>Spam Isn't Protected Speech</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I take issue with Times readers Janine Levinson and Ben Perry, both
of whom present opinions against the banning of spam e-mails
["Banning Spam Would Kill Free Speech," Letters, April 7].</LD>
<LD>   Levinson defends spam on the basis of the 1st Amendment, whereas
Perry feels that banning spam would have serious economic effects.</LD>
<LD>   The 1st Amendment protects freedom of the press and speech; it
does not require the recipient to pay for what is printed or spoken.
Spam, telemarketing calls and junk faxes have in common that the
recipient of the message must pay in time or money or both for the
unwanted message.</LD>
<TE>   It is the recipient who pays for the Internet connection and who
must waste time deleting the unwanted material.</TE>
<TE>   It is the recipient who pays the phone bill and who must take her
precious time--often interrupting something important--to answer the
telemarketer's phone call.</TE>
<TE>   It is the recipient of junk faxes who pays for the fax paper, the
wear and tear on the machine and the electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Spam and its relatives are not, therefore, protected by the 1st
Amendment unless the sender is willing to pay for the privilege of
transmitting the message.</TE>
<TE>   As for the economic argument, if the consumer is required to pay
for unwanted advertising (without other content, as in a magazine),
that is tantamount to making charities of the marketers who purvey
these ads.</TE>
<TE>   Richard E. Goodman</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Janine Levinson writes: "I would rather spend an extra three
minutes a day deleting the many unsolicited e-mails that I receive
than accept the overwhelming burden of telling merchants (unsavory or
otherwise) that they haven't the privilege to advertise via e-mail."</TE>
<TE>   Three minutes a day adds up to two full work days that every
worker with e-mail spends deleting spam. Multiply this by the tens of
millions of workers who get unsolicited e-mails and you see what a
drag on the economy spam is.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>James Flanigan stated a very real fact: No industry was hit as
severely as travel ["Hotel Industry's Plan Confirm Recovery--and
More," March 31]. But within the industry, travel agents have been
battered on all fronts. During the days following Sept. 11, we did
most of the airlines' work--for no profit--simply out of the desire
to assist during a crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the airlines' assault on U.S. travel agencies continues
unabated. Their actions draw little attention. The major U.S. air
carriers recently dropped commissions to U.S. travel agencies to
zero.</LD>
<LD>   We travel agents are told we cannot band together--that's a
violation of antitrust laws. Yet, all major airlines announce the
same policy within days and that's not collusion?</LD>

<LD>Question: My friend and I each have substantial amounts of cash. My
balances are in the five digits, while my friend has more than
$100,000. Our problem is that we owe substantial amounts to the IRS
and other tax agencies. We want to park this cash someplace where it
will be safe and we have access to it, but where the IRS can't find
it. Please don't advise me to resolve my tax problems. I tried, and
it's impossible!</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Baloney.</LD>
<LD>   Your issues--whatever they are--can be resolved, as soon as you
abandon the idea that you can somehow hide your assets from the IRS.
Find an attorney who specializes in solving tax problems and hire him
or her. Your local bar association can offer referrals. It may take
some time, and the willingness to pay a few bucks, but your situation
isn't "impossible."</LD>
<TE>   By the way, how dare you ask for help in committing tax fraud!
Have you never read this column before? The whole point of Money Talk
is helping people resolve their financial problems in ethical and
legal ways. If you want criminal or bogus solutions, there are plenty
of fly-by-night outfits that are willing to take--and disappear
with--your cash.</TE>
<TE>   Software Can't Replace Savvy Tax Professional</TE>
<TE>   Q: Can you recommend a tax software package that could replace my
accountant? I'm a television writer who receives two or three W-2s
each year. I'll claim some work-related expenses (commuting, movie
admissions, a new computer, etc.). I have a feeling that my return is
a fairly simple one and that my accountant probably isn't doing much
more than I would if I had some good software. What do you think?</TE>
<TE>   A: The leading tax software--Intuit's TurboTax and H&amp;R Block's
TaxCut--gets better every year. But software probably will never
replace a good accountant, particularly for someone at a high risk of
audit. And that's you.</TE>
<TE>   People in the entertainment industry tend to get audited more
frequently than others. The kinds of things you want to deduct are
the items that tend to draw the most scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Having an IRS-savvy pro on your side will reduce the likelihood of
your return being plucked for review, and your accountant could
better handle any audit questions than you could.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say everyone has to have their return prepared by a
tax professional. Folks with relatively simple returns--one W-2 from
one employer, little or no capital gains income and few write-offs
other than a mortgage deduction--can handle their own returns.</TE>
<TE>   But people with complicated financial situations, such as
small-business owners, investors and those with multiple employers,
are better off getting some help.</TE>
<TE>   Joint Tenancy With Parents Still a Risk</TE>
<TE>   Q: I think you overstated the tax disadvantages of owning a home
in joint tenancy with one's children. In most cases, the IRS will
acknowledge that the transfer was a gift and include the entire value
of the home in the parent's estate, thus giving the heirs the full
step-up in tax basis you said they could lose. Owning a home in joint
tenancy with children is a reasonable solution for people of modest
means who hope to avoid probate.</TE>
<TE>   A: You're right--my answer should have said the heirs "could" face
a bigger tax bill, not that they "would." If the heirs had
contributed anything to the home, the IRS could take the position
that a portion would not receive a new basis for tax purposes.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mitigate the legal disadvantages of joint tenancy,
however. If one of the children gets sued or declares bankruptcy, the
creditors could come after the parent's home. In this litigious and
debt-ridden society, that's probably more risk than most parents want
to bear.</TE>

<HD>Don't Panic: IRS Offers Some Ways to Help You Pay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You've finished your tax return and now you've got that sinking
feeling--the one that comes when you find out shortly before the
tax-filing deadline that you owe the IRS money and you don't have the
cash to pay it.</LD>
<LD>   There's no easy way out, but there are fewer reasons to panic than
in the past. Largely because the IRS realized that some otherwise
honest taxpayers were dropping out of the system when they couldn't
afford to pay, the agency has launched programs over the last few
years to make paying income taxes easier, even when you're broke.</LD>
<LD>   "We have done a great deal to encourage people to file returns
even when they can't pay," said Don Roberts, an IRS spokesman in
Washington. "Taxpayers should know that when they file."</LD>
<TE>   What are the options?</TE>
<TE>   Installment Plan</TE>
<TE>   The IRS has streamlined its installment agreement program, which
allows individuals to make monthly payments on their past-due income
tax bills.</TE>
<TE>   Those who owe less than $25,000 and are able to pay it off in less
than five years can participate in the agency's streamlined approval
process. Simply attach a Form 9465 to the front of your completed tax
return, listing the proposed monthly payment amount.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS will review the request and respond within a few months.
Those who need the installment agreement form, and a good idea of
whether their payment plan will be accepted, can find an interactive
work sheet and printable forms on the IRS Web site at www.irs.gov.</TE>
<TE>   If the debt and payment plan meet the streamlined approval
requirements, the IRS generally will accept the deal without looking
at whether the taxpayer could borrow money elsewhere or sell assets
to pay the bill, Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   If the taxpayer owes more than $25,000 or is unable to pay within
five years, approval is not assured, but the taxpayer may apply for
installment agreements.</TE>
<TE>   IRS acceptance of an installment agreement means the agency won't
seize or place liens on a taxpayer's assets and income to pay off
back taxes.</TE>
<TE>   An installment agreement is like any other loan, however. There's
a $43 fee to set it up, which will be taken out of the first payment,
Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS also charges interest, currently 6% a year. The interest
rate is reset every three months, though, so if market interest rates
rise, so will the cost of holding outstanding tax debts.</TE>
<TE>   A late-payment penalty is assessed each month that the debt
remains outstanding. Normally, that late payment fee would be 0.5% of
the balance due. However, those who filed their return on time and
did not receive a levy notice before asking for an installment
agreement get a reduced penalty amounting to 0.25% a month.</TE>
<TE>   Charge It</TE>
<TE>   The IRS accepts major credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard,
American Express and Discover.</TE>
<TE>   The upside of charging tax payments is that some credit card
issuers have rewards programs that can generate free airline tickets,
discounts on cars or other perks.</TE>
<TE>   The downside is that there's a "convenience fee" of 2.5% of the
payment amount. If you charge a $1,000 tax bill, your credit card
will show a $1,025 purchase. If the tax charge is $5,000, you pay
$5,125.</TE>
<TE>   That fee goes to the card issuer--not to the IRS--and often
cancels out any economic benefit that you can gain from the reward
cards, said Robert McKinley, publisher of an online credit card
newsletter called CardWeb.com.</TE>
<TE>   McKinley estimates that each frequent flier air mile you receive
is worth about 2.5 cents. If you pay 2.5% on each tax dollar charged,
the transaction is a wash.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few exceptions, McKinley says. General Motors Corp.'s
MasterCard offers a 5% reward. So someone who charged $10,000 on a GM
card would pay a $250 convenience fee but earn a $500 rebate toward
the purchase of a new car. That would put this taxpayer $250 ahead.</TE>
<TE>   With airline cards, there can be some benefits to charging for
miles if you use your miles just right, McKinley said. He uses miles
to upgrade airline tickets to business or first-class seats. Though a
coach ticket might run $600, a first-class fare often is thousands
more.</TE>
<TE>   However, the modest benefit consumers receive from these reward
cards is quickly eaten away if they maintain a balance on the card
for any length of time.</TE>
<TE>   "Credit card rates are averaging 14.5%, so a 6% IRS installment
plan is better," McKinley said.</TE>
<TE>   Some consumers may be more comfortable dealing with a credit card
company than the IRS if there's a chance they won't be able to make
all the payments, he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, falling behind on your credit card payments also can be
expensive, with interest rates on the unpaid monthly balance spiking
to 25% or more.</TE>

<LD>Imagine you're a Merrill Lynch stock broker trying to explain to your
clients why shares of Company X are a good buy now. And as evidence,
you cite a recent bullish research report that a Merrill analyst
wrote about the company.</LD>
<LD>   If your clients have been reading the newspapers lately, their
first question may be: Could we see the analyst's private e-mails
about this stock, rather than rely on the research report?</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the New York state attorney general shocked Wall Street
by going public with some of his office's findings from a 10-month
investigation of Merrill's Internet-stock research group and its
conduct during the technology stock boom, then bust, of 2000 and
2001.</LD>
<TE>   The brokerage industry was stunned because it had been expecting,
or at least hoping, that regulators' investigations of analysts'
potential conflicts of interest in their stock touting could be
settled without the release of inflammatory internal communications
and documents.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer dropped a bomb: a
37-page report filled with e-mails between Merrill analysts and
investment bankers. Spitzer contends the e-mails show that analysts
often were driven to tout Internet stocks simply to assist Merrill's
pursuit of lucrative investment-banking work with the subject firms.
In private, the analysts viewed many of the stocks as garbage,
Spitzer alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The report has made Spitzer an instant hero to many investors (and
their attorneys), and an instant nemesis to Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   The battle between Spitzer and the brokerage industry may have
only begun: Subpoenas have gone out to other major brokerages.
Spitzer has said he may seek criminal charges under the authority of
New York anti-fraud laws.</TE>
<TE>   The state's probe is creating problems for other regulators. The
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been drafting its own
ideas for industry reform, after congressional hearings last year
that focused on analysts' objectivity, or lack thereof, in feeding
the great bull market of the late-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC had little to say last week about Spitzer's report, but
sources say the federal agency this week will get copies of the
documents the attorney general has collected. The SEC could have
sought the same e-mails from Merrill and other brokerages, but
according to one source, the agency, in its own investigation, didn't
ask the brokerages for e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   Research, Banking Not Totally Separate</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's supporters say that, in going public with the material,
he shined a bright light on how things really work in the research
departments of major brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   Institutional investors have always taken the view that much of
what Wall Street publishes on individual stocks is at least somewhat
suspect, because investment banking is what pays the bills at firms
like Merrill, while research is a cost center rather than a profit
center.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the supposed presence of a "Chinese wall" between research
and banking, there's no way one side can be completely ignorant of
the activities on the other side, critics have long argued.</TE>
<TE>   But most small investors sucked into the market by the tech-stock
hype of 1999 and 2000 arguably didn't understand that potential for
conflict of interest. So when Merrill analysts officially rated a
stock "buy," the public took the brokerage at its word, Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   That obviously didn't work out so well for buyers of many
Internet-related shares in 2000 and 2001. The dot-com stock meltdown
has been one of the greatest busts in Wall Street history, and it
still hasn't run its course: The Interactive Week magazine index of
48 Net-related shares is down 25% this year after plunging 51% in
2000 and 48% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   One part of the attorney general's report contends that Merrill
analysts had the firm's top rating--a "1-1"--on shares of Net
services firm InfoSpace in July 2000, when the stock was in the
mid-$30s (down from a peak of $130 that winter).</TE>
<TE>   Yet a private e-mail in July 2000 from Henry Blodget, the head of
Merrill's Internet research team, called the stock "a powder keg,
given how aggressive we were on it earlier this year and given the
'bad smell' comments that so many institutions are bringing up."</TE>
<TE>   By December 2000, InfoSpace shares had plunged under $10. The
stock now is at $1.46.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2000, Merrill's official rating on Internet Capital
Group was a "2-1." Under the firm's rating system, the first number
gauged the stock's potential in the near term (12 months) and the
second number rated the longer-term potential. Each stock was rated
between "1" and "5" for each time horizon, with a "1" meaning "buy"
and the other numbers meaning, in order, "accumulate," "neutral,"
"reduce" and "sell."</TE>
<TE>   Although Internet Capital got Merrill's second-highest official
rating in October 2000, with the stock at $13 (down from a record
high of $183 in 1999), an e-mail from Blodget to another Merrill
analyst said the price was "going to 5," according to Spitzer's
report.</TE>
<TE>   Blodget was right: By December 2000 the stock was under $5. It now
trades for 58 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Blodget, who left Merrill in December 2001, has declined to
comment on the attorney general's report, referring inquiries to
Merrill.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill's initial response to Spitzer's report was outrage. "There
is no basis for the allegations," the firm said in a statement last
week. "E-mails are only one piece of a continuous conversation,
isolated at a single point in time--not the end conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   "As with oral conversation, e-mails may include ill-chosen words
and offensive language, but this does not add up to evidence of
wrongdoing," Merrill said.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also said Blodget "repeatedly and publicly warned that a
substantial majority of public Internet companies would never make
money and would disappear, and that investors should commit only a
small amount of their total portfolio to a diversified basket of
stocks which they were prepared to hold long-term."</TE>
<TE>   Report Questions Analysts' Independence</TE>
<TE>   Privately, Merrill officials are livid that Spitzer released the
report for public consumption. They also point out that though
Spitzer took sworn testimony from about 20 people, the report
includes no comments that any of them may have made in Merrill's
defense.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those called to testify for the report may have had
relatively little to say. The report says at the outset that "while
Merrill Lynch has been cooperative in producing evidence, some of the
key witnesses examined have displayed an implausible lack of
recollection of key conversations and documents, even when they
authored or received such document and it was placed before them."</TE>
<TE>   If there is a smoking gun in Spitzer's report, it may be an e-mail
said to have been sent by Deepak Raj, Merrill's co-head of global
equity research, to all of the firm's analysts in fall 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill, Spitzer says, had long insisted that its research
analysts were independent and unbiased. But the Raj e-mail
contradicts that idea, the report says, because it suggests that
analysts' compensation was directly linked to investment-banking
deals they helped to generate.</TE>
<TE>   Raj wrote to his analysts: "We are once again surveying your
contributions to investment banking during the year....Please provide
complete details on your involvement in the transaction, paying
particular attention to the degree that your research coverage played
a role in origination, execution and follow-up."</TE>
<TE>   In its response to Spitzer's report, Merrill said: "Research
analyst compensation is based on broad factors and is not tied
directly to the success of investment banking transactions."</TE>
<TE>   Though Spitzer's report attacks Merrill's analysts for their

<HD>Merrill's Dealings With Pasadena Firm Probed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One chapter of the New York attorney general's report on alleged
conflicts of interest within Merrill Lynch's Internet-analyst
research group deals with the brokerage's relationship with GoTo.com,
now called Overture Services, a Pasadena-based Internet search
provider.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill sought to provide investment banking business to GoTo in
2000, the report says. In September of that year GoTo chose Merrill
to handle a private placement of stock for a European subsidiary of
GoTo.</LD>
<LD>   The report alleges that Thomas Mazzucco, a Merrill banker,
committed to GoTo executives that the brokerage's research department
would initiate coverage of the company.</LD>
<TE>   When that coverage began in January 2001, the report says, an
institutional investor e-mailed Merrill's Internet research chief,
Henry Blodget, asking "what's so interesting about GoTo except
banking fees????" Blodget replied: "nothin."</TE>
<TE>   The report further details conflicts between Merrill analysts and
investment bankers over the rating of GoTo stock, and alleges that a
junior analyst solicited GoTo executives' comments on Merrill's
initial draft report on the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill ultimately did not handle the European stock deal for
GoTo, and lost a bid for other business from GoTo in spring 2001.
Shortly thereafter, the report alleges, Merrill research downgraded
GoTo's shares.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill, in a statement, said there was no connection between the
downgrade and the investment banking decision.</TE>
<TE>   As for investors who bought GoTo on Merrill's initial
recommendation in January 2001, they have made money if they've held
on: The stock, $10 at that point, now is at $23.50.</TE>
<TE>   Kasey Byrne, a spokesman for Overture Services, said the firm has
been cooperating with the attorney general's probe. She said
executives were "surprised and disappointed" by the report's details
regarding Merrill, adding that the firm believes "we were a victim of
Merrill's practices."</TE>

<LD>Auditor's Plea a Blow to Andersen, Enron</LD>
<LD>   Accounting firm Andersen faced new pressure to settle federal
criminal charges after former partner David Duncan pleaded guilty to
illegally destroying documents related to an audit of Enron Corp.
Duncan also agreed to cooperate with the government against his
former firm.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan, chief auditor for the Enron account, agreed to enter a
plea after learning that the Securities and Exchange Commission had
opened an inquiry into Enron's crumbling finances.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC also challenged a retention-bonus plan for 1,700 Enron
employees, saying the company hadn't provided enough evidence that
bonuses totaling as much as $137 million are warranted.</TE>
<TE>   Brokerage Probe Gains Momentum</TE>
<TE>   In a surprise legal action, New York's attorney general, alleging
severe conflicts of interest at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s
Internet-research operation in recent years, asked a judge to order
the company to begin disclosing new information about the interaction
between the firm's investment-banking and stock-research units.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Enron Corp. shareholders who lost billions of dollars
charged that the company's investment banks played a key role in the
firm's downfall by creating off-the-books partnerships that fed its
collapse. The allegations were included in an expanded class-action
suit filed in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   In the Merrill case, New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer said a
10-month investigation of the brokerage's Internet-research group
discovered that Merrill analysts routinely questioned the validity of
their own stock recommendations and, in some cases, bemoaned the
pressure they felt to talk up the prospects of companies that were
investment banking clients.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts say the investment industry could be facing broad
exposure to suits by burned clients as a result of the probe.</TE>
<TE>   State Jobless Rate Rises in March</TE>
<TE>   Signaling that the economic recovery has yet to trickle down to
the job market, California's unemployment rate rose to 6.4% in March,
matching the five-year high set in January.</TE>
<TE>   Last month's rise from February's revised 6.2% rate was the result
of anemic job creation. In March, California employers boosted their
payrolls by a paltry 200 jobs, underscoring their continued
reluctance to hire additional workers in a climate of uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   California's rise in joblessness mimicked that of the nation,
which increased to 5.7% in March from 5.5% in February.</TE>
<TE>   A Smooth Ride for Alameda Corridor</TE>
<TE>   The $2.4-billion Alameda Corridor, a 20-mile rail cargo expressway
linking the nation's busiest harbor complex with adjacent rail yards,
opened relatively free of problems.</TE>
<TE>   The corridor rail trench will carry more than $200 billion in
imports and exports through Southern California and help boost the
region's status in global trade as a beachhead for a third of the
seaborne cargo coming into the U.S., mostly from Asia and Latin
America.</TE>
<TE>   Crude Oil Prices Drop on Venezuela Coup</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil had its biggest drop in five months on expectations that
Venezuela will increase production after the ouster of President Hugo
Chavez, who had led efforts by OPEC to limit supply.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, who was forced from office by the military after a popular
uprising, transformed Venezuela into one of the staunchest adherents
to OPEC production quotas, from its biggest cheater.</TE>
<TE>   His ouster extended a 15% slide in oil prices from a seven-month
high this month on reduced concern that Israeli-Palestinian violence
would disrupt Middle East supplies.</TE>
<TE>   After a volatile week, crude oil for May delivery fell $1.52, or
6.1%, to $23.47 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
lowest closing price since March 6.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T to Seek OK for Reverse Stock Split</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Corp. surprised Wall Street by announcing a step more typical
of tiny companies with poor prospects: a reverse stock split.</TE>
<TE>   The long-distance giant said it will ask shareholders to approve a
1-for-5 reverse stock split once management sells the company's cable
business. The effect should be to boost the market price of the
stock, though the change won't affect shareholders' wealth.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T, whose shares have been battered since early 2000 along with
most other telecom issues, appears to fear that the pending sale of
its cable assets to Comcast Corp. could leave AT&amp;T stock trading
below $5, hurting the company's image, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T ended the week down almost 10% at $13.60 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Reports by GE, IBM Disappoint Investors</TE>
<TE>   General Electric Co., under fire to disclose more detailed
financial data, disappointed investors by reporting first-quarter
revenue that was nearly unchanged from a year earlier at $30.5
billion, further indicating that the U.S. economic rebound has a long
way to go.</TE>
<TE>   The company is considered an economic bellwether because its
segments include appliances, energy power systems, medical equipment,
financial services and the NBC television network.</TE>
<TE>   GE's report came on top of a gloomy outlook by IBM Corp., also
known for its historically steady growth. IBM said its first-quarter
revenue and profit would fall well short of forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   "The business environment is still very tough," said Keith Sherin,
GE's chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Kirch's Core Holdings Seek Creditor Protection</TE>
<TE>   Media mogul Leo Kirch's core television and rights-trading
businesses filed for protection from creditors, heralding the biggest
bankruptcy in post-World War II Germany and rocking national
institutions from the chancellery to the Bundesliga soccer league.</TE>
<TE>   Kirch's media holdings collapsed under a load of debt, about $1.2
billion of the $5.7 billion owed from all of his enterprises. The
debt includes $352 million owed to Hollywood studios for film rights.</TE>
<TE>   With a legal declaration of insolvency for KirchMedia and
KirchPayTV, the main holdings of Kirch Group, the 75-year-old founder
bowed out of his namesake empire.</TE>
<TE>   Clothing Firm Adopts Non-Sweatshop Concept</TE>
<TE>   Ice cream mogul turned social activist Ben Cohen is backing a Los
Angeles-based garment-making enterprise to help raise awareness of
working conditions in garment shops while proving to other
manufacturers that it's possible to pay a "living" wage and still
earn a profit.</TE>
<TE>   SweatX brand of casual clothing will be marketed to college
bookstores and high-end sports shops.</TE>
<TE>   The operation is run by a former banker who took a 50% pay cut and
is staffed by veteran garment workers who will be paid $8.50 an hour,
with benefits, a pension and profit-sharing.</TE>
<TE>   Pittman Put Back in Charge of AOL</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Inc. removed Barry Schuler as head of its Internet
division and temporarily gave the job back to Bob Pittman, who will
attempt to revitalize the unit while also serving as chief operating
officer of the parent company.</TE>
<TE>   The reshuffling reflects growing anxiety on Wall Street about the
Internet unit's performance and its prospects for growth.</TE>
<TE>   Pittman, who served as AOL's chief executive before Schuler took
the post in January 2001, is widely respected by investors as an
operational wizard who helped turn Dulles, Va.-based AOL into an
Internet powerhouse in the late 1990s.</TE>

<HD>The Steep Cost of Cleaner, Cheaper Coal</HD>
<DH>Environment: The White House, activists are clashing over
mountaintop mining.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARTIE, W.Va.
</DL>
<LD>The cluster of forested peaks that soared skyward behind Donald
"Joe" Barnett's house is gone. So are the streams that flowed through
them. Miners sheared several hundred feet off the mountaintops to expose
rich veins of coal and then piled up the leftover rock and dirt in a
nearby valley to make a naked, flat-topped, 400-foot plateau.</LD>
<LD>   This so-called valley fill is just one of hundreds across the rugged
terrain of Appalachia that have covered more than 1,000 miles of streams
in a decade-long boom of "mountaintop removal" that has permanently
changed the topography in the southwest corner of West Virginia.</LD>
<LD>   To the mining companies, demolishing mountains and filling valleys is
the only economical way to get the state's cleaner-burning coal, which
generates affordable electricity to millions of homes and high-paying
jobs for thousands of workers.</LD>
<TE>   And the Bush administration, which counts boosting energy production
among its priorities, is poised to use its regulatory powers to help the
miners continue the practice.</TE>
<TE>   Many Appalachia residents whose lives are nestled into the quiet
hollows aren't sure how much more of the unmistakable environmental
transformation they can take. The residents have sued to stop the mining,
contending that it strips the region of its coal, as well as its unique
charm. Filling the valleys with the dirt and rock, they say, erases
streams, threatens wildlife, sullies drinking water and causes dangerous
flooding. Perhaps even more threatening, millions of gallons of sludge
from processing the coal is stored permanently in huge dams near their
communities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the biggest localized environmental disaster in the country,"
said lawyer Joe Lovett of the Appalachian Center for the Economy and the
Environment. "But it's ignored because it keeps coal prices low."</TE>
<TE>   Lovett represented a group of West Virginians who filed a lawsuit
against the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1990s, charging that large
valley fills violated the federal Surface Mining and Clean Water acts.
The corps has routinely issued permits that allow coal companies to bury
streams and valleys in the unwanted dirt and rock, even though Clean
Water Act regulations do not give it clear authority to do so.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge ruled against the corps in 1999, but an appeals court
voided his decision on jurisdictional grounds, leaving unresolved the
practice's legality and putting the industry on edge.</TE>
<TE>   A newer lawsuit filed by Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, an
environmental group, challenges the corps' right to permit a huge
mountaintop project in Kentucky that would fill more than 20 valleys and
cover more than six miles of streams. That suit is now pending before the
same federal judge, and it could bring mountaintop mining to a halt by
making large valley fills illegal.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration wants to make sure that doesn't happen. A
senior administration official, speaking on the condition that he not be
named, said as early as this month the administration planned to rewrite
regulations to allow dirt displaced by mining to be dumped in waterways.
This likely would undermine the pending legal challenge and legitimize
valley fills.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Clean Water Act and current corps regulations, acceptable
"fill materials"--those allowed in waterways--include rock, sand and dirt
displaced by development, roadways and erosion protection. The act and
the rules specifically exclude the disposal of any material that's
primarily considered waste--such as the dirt displaced by mining.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration plans to strip that exclusion from the law by
redefining what is acceptable fill material.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the Bush administration refused to confirm the details of
the prospective rule change, which was originally proposed by the Clinton
administration. But two senior officials, asking not to be named,
defended the decision, saying it would bring the corps in line with the
Environmental Protection Agency's definition of "fill material."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials and coal industry representatives describe
the change as a bureaucratic clarification.</TE>
<TE>   That's not how local residents or environmentalists see it.</TE>
<TE>   Lovett, who is also representing the Kentucky plaintiffs, says the
administration's move is the equivalent of changing the speed limit when
you get caught speeding.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists call it one of the Bush administration's biggest
rollbacks of the Clean Water Act, opening the nation's waterways to all
sorts of wastes. The administration has made a series of actions that
weaken environmental protections at the behest of industry, including
lowering efficiency standards for air conditioners, reducing hurdles for
hard rock mining and backing away from the decade-old commitment to
prevent a net loss of wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   Even 12 GOP House members wrote President Bush late last month urging
him not to make this "ill-advised and dangerous" rules change.</TE>
<TE>   The change also would affect hard rock mining in the West--most
notably in Alaska and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Mara Bacsujlaky, assistant director of the Northern Alaska
Environmental Center, says she has used the current regulations to
prevent the operators of Fort Knox gold mine near Fairbanks from filling
wetlands. She said the rules change would deliver "a very serious blow"
to efforts to prevent mining companies from harming streams and wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   To Barnett and many other people living in the hollows below the West
Virginia mining sites, the Bush administration's rules change is nothing
less than a threat to their very way of life.</TE>
<TE>   The scale of what is being done here is visible best from the air.
Giant machines remove several hundred vertical feet of the mountaintops
to expose multiple seams of coal, which lie between rocks like the
filling in a many-layered cake.</TE>
<TE>   The miners extract the coal and heap the unwanted rock and dirt into
the valleys. Other valleys are brimming with massive pools of thick black
sludge, hundreds of feet high and as broad as good-sized lakes. Steep
peaks are replaced by miles-long stretches of broad, barren plateaus.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, two more mountaintop mining operations plan to move into the
snug valley where Joe Barnett built a house for his family--with his own
hands, and savings from a lifetime of coal mining--on land that had been
in his wife's family for many generations.</TE>
<TE>   "We were surrounded by God's beautiful nature," Barnett, 52, said.
"Now we're surrounded by coal companies' devastation."</TE>
<TE>   The explosives used by miners to blow mountains apart have forged a
several-inch gap between the ceiling and the walls through much of
Barnett's house. Long cracks punctuate the walls in one of his son's
bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I drove every nail with love," Barnett said. "It breaks my heart that
this house is being torn all to pieces."</TE>
<TE>   Then last summer, flood waters raged through his valley. Two people
were killed and 1,500 homes were destroyed in the hollows of southwest
West Virginia. The state is investigating whether the mining and timber
industries bear blame for the intensity of the flooding.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett and many other people living there have no doubt that they do.</TE>
<TE>   Right after the disaster, coal company employees dug out White Oak
Creek, the stream flowing past Barnett's house, to prevent flooding and
protect the road that coal trucks use. Barnett's well, and many others in
the valley, immediately went dry.</TE>
<TE>   And many of the little things that made life in the hollows special
have vanished.</TE>
<TE>   Migratory songbirds such as the Louisiana waterthrush are declining in
population because they need large swaths of hardwood forests, which were
abundant in Appalachia before the mountaintop mining boom, said Jeffrey
Towner, the field supervisor for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's
West Virginia field office.</TE>
<TE>   Federally listed threatened or endangered species--including the
Indiana bat, several fish and 25 types of mussels--are also being
affected, Towner said.</TE>
<TE>   "The individual and cumulative impacts to both aquatic and terrestrial
ecosystems caused by mining projects authorized in the Appalachians . . .
are unprecedented," Towner said in a letter urging the Corps of Engineers
to stop its approval of such operations.</TE>
<TE>   A 1998 study by the Fish and Wildlife Service found that more than 900
miles of streams--470 of them in West Virginia--already had been buried
in valley fills in Appalachia. Permitting has continued briskly since
then.</TE>
<TE>   "Small first-order streams form the heart and soul of the functional
stream ecosystem," said Bernard Sweeney, director of the Stroud Water
Research Center in Avondale, Pa. "They support a wide variety of unique
species and are critical to larger downstream tributaries.</TE>
<TE>   "Any discussion of destroying even one first-order stream is out of
order."</TE>
<TE>   The state's forester was so angry about the devastation to forests and
his inability to rein in coal companies that he quit his job in 1998 in
protest. "It's a short-term gain for a long-term loss," said William
Maxey, the former forester. "Our mountains were beautiful. What the coal
companies are doing makes them uninhabitable."</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the Environmental Protection Agency and the state
Department of Environmental Protection say too little is known to comment
on the cumulative effects on forests, waterways and wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of a settlement of part of the 1999 case against the Corps
of Engineers, a sweeping federal study of the environmental impacts is
underway. The settlement effectively required the mining companies to
limit the size of valley fills to 250 acres. So now the companies are
requesting and getting permits for more valley fills for each project,
according to Lewis Halstead, assistant director of the mining division of
the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection.</TE>
<TE>   Mountaintop removal mining started in the early 1970s and accelerated
after the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act gave utilities major
incentives to use low-sulfur coal, the kind found here.</TE>
<TE>   The coal industry and most of the state's politicians see mountaintop
mining as an important technological advance that provides electricity
across the East and drives the state's economy. The 60 million tons of
low-sulfur coal from West Virginia's surface mines last year could have
fueled 32 million homes for a year, the National Coal Mining Assn.
estimated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not scorched earth and it's not devastation," said Bill Rainey,
president of the West Virginia Coal Assn. "It's a methodical engineering
process."</TE>
<TE>   It provides jobs and flattens out the region's relentlessly rugged
land so that it can be used for development that can support more jobs,
Rainey added. A prison, an airport and a high school are among the
structures built on former mountaintop mining sites.</TE>
<TE>   Public objections to the projects have mushroomed in recent years as
the mining operations have expanded. Meanwhile, the number of mine
employees decreased because mountaintop projects are highly mechanized.
From 1990 to 2000, the number of miners in West Virginia dropped by half
to 15,000, according to the National Mining Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Although West Virginia produced more coal in the 1990s than in any
previous decade, the only hint in the Coal River valley communities that
they are in the midst of a thriving industry is the steady stream of
coal-filled tractor-trailers passing through on narrow West Virginia
Route 3.</TE>
<TE>   "On a daily basis, we see millions of dollars going past our eyes, and
yet we live in poverty," said Judy Bonds, organizer for the Coal River
Mountain Watch, the local environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's floods were another wake-up call to residents, who have
been putting up with the coal companies for several generations.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, 49, and her daughter and grandson were the last to be bought
out of their ancestral hollow, Marfork. By then, the air was so thick
with emissions from the coal operation that a doctor said her grandson's
asthma could not be treated successfully unless they moved.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was only one of thousands of residents paid to leave their homes
as the mining operations moved in. Most leave only when life has become
so miserable that they have no other choice.</TE>
<TE>   Marfork is now home to a slurry impoundment the size of a large
mountain. The structure is permitted to hold 5 billion gallons of water
and wastes from processing coal. From the air it resembles the Hoover Dam
full of thick black sludge.</TE>
<TE>   One of Bonds' many tasks is to ensure that it does not break, like one
in Kentucky that spilled 250 million gallons of toxic sludge in October
2000. Another task is to save the valley's elementary and high schools,
which are scheduled to be closed as more mining projects move in.</TE>
<TE>   The coal companies, she said, want the entire valley for their
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're in their way, and our roots are dug in deep," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the sixth generation of her family to live in this valley,
Bonds said: "We love our life in the hollows. There is nothing like being
in the hollows. You feel snuggled. You feel safe. It seems like God has
his arms around you."</TE>
<TE>   She and other local activists acknowledged that given coal industry's
influence in Washington and Charleston, the state capital, the odds are
against them.</TE>
<TE>   "If we save one ridge, we will have accomplished something," Bonds
said.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what Larry Gibson is trying to do.</TE>
<TE>   Gibson, 50, a retired General Motors maintenance worker, persuaded his
fellow heirs of Kayford Mountain, northeast of Whitesville, not to sell
to the mining companies. For nine months he has lived without electricity
or running water in a cabin on top of the mountain to draw attention to
the plight of his beloved childhood region.</TE>
<TE>   He invites journalists from around the world, federal officials,
college students and the public to his rustic outpost to see for
themselves the impact of the mountaintop mining that surrounds his
thickly wooded refuge.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to help people reclaim these mountains, but most people
here think they can't do anything to stop the coal companies," Gibson
said, choking back tears. "They hope I hold them back. They call me the
man with a finger in the dike."</TE>

<HD>Powell Cancels Arafat Meeting After New Blast</HD>
<DH>Mideast: A Palestinian woman kills herself and six others in
Jerusalem as the Sabbath nears. It's an inauspicious beginning for U.S.
secretary of State's peace mission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>On the first day of his peace mission, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell held intense talks with Israeli leaders Friday and nearly came
face to face with the violence that brought him here, as a young
Palestinian woman blew herself up near a busy Jerusalem marketplace,
killing six shoppers.</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of the attack, which occurred shortly before Israelis
began the Sabbath at dusk Friday, Powell called off talks scheduled for
Saturday with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat at his
besieged headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah.</LD>
<LD>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia linked to Arafat's Fatah
movement, claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomber reportedly
came from the Jenin refugee camp, a focus of Israel's 2-week-old West
Bank offensive and the home of many of the suicide attackers who have
wreaked havoc on Israelis.</LD>
<TE>   In terse language, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
that Powell "condemns in the strongest possible terms" the terrorist
attack and "expects Chairman Arafat to do so as well. It is important
that Arafat not miss this opportunity to take a clear stand against the
violence that harms the Palestinian cause."</TE>
<TE>   "In light of today's developments, the secretary will not be meeting
with Arafat Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said the talks might be rescheduled for Sunday,
although no arrangements have been made--and a decision is likely to
depend on what happens next and whether Arafat complies with the American
demands.</TE>
<TE>   The gruesome suicide bombing shook a bus stop near Mahane Yehuda, an
outdoor market about half a mile from Powell's motorcade and a mile from
the hotel where he is staying. The bomber was identified by Radio Israel
as Nidal Daraghmeh of Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   After an eight-day battle in the Jenin camp, the army moved to collect
and bury the bodies of Palestinian gunmen killed resisting the Israelis.
News of the impending burials stirred fresh allegations, denied by
Israel, that the army killed hundreds of civilians in the camp and is
trying to hide the bodies. Israel's chief justice ordered a temporary
halt to the burial plan late Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's attack in Jerusalem, the 110th suicide bombing in the last 18
months of fighting, drew an angry reaction from the White House, which
charged that extremists are trying to disrupt Powell's mission.</TE>
<TE>   "The president will not be deterred from seeking peace," White House
Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said. "Today would be a very good day for
Yasser Arafat to publicly denounce terrorism and show some
statesmanship."</TE>
<TE>   After just one day in Israel, Powell faces a new crisis. The secretary
is "looking at the whole situation in terms of the bombing and where we
stand and where we are," Boucher told reporters traveling with Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Powell was informed of the bombing by Israeli Defense Minister
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer as he rode in a tightly guarded convoy from his
hotel to the Israeli parliament's helipad to fly to northern Israel. He
then flew over the site as rescue workers and ambulances scrambled to
help the wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Powell later denounced the attack and said it illustrated the "need
for all of us, everyone, the international community, to exert every
effort to find a solution."</TE>
<TE>   Powell also witnessed the mounting dangers along the nearly 50-mile
border between Israel and Lebanon, which has become increasingly tense
during the Israeli offensive. Although the Bush administration dispatched
Powell largely because of the Israeli-Palestinian hostilities, the danger
of the conflict spilling over into neighboring countries has intruded on
Powell's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   As if to underscore the challenge Powell faces, Lebanon-based
Hezbollah guerrillas opened fire with antitank rockets and mortars as the
secretary toured the border about two hours after the suicide bombing in
Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Powell was briefed by the Israeli military in Safed, which is about
eight miles from the Lebanese border and 20 miles from Shabaa Farms, a
disputed frontier area that is the site of escalating attacks by
Hezbollah. In the midst of what Powell described as a sobering briefing,
Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran and Syria, again opened fire.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Dinor Shavit, spokesman for Israel's Northern Command, said that
Israel was "not far from reacting, not far from retaliating. We have
people with matches in this region, and it's very easy to light a fire."</TE>
<TE>   Powell called on Syria and other nations with influence to restrain
Hezbollah before the escalation widens the conflict in the region.</TE>
<TE>   It was a rocky start for Powell's diplomatic rescue mission. The
secretary began the day with a four-hour meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon, including a 2 1/2-hour session between the two
retired generals and war heroes at Sharon's residence. Sharon showed
Powell gruesome pictures of victims from previous suicide bombings,
according to Israeli sources.</TE>
<TE>   At a joint news conference, Powell used flowery language to describe
the long U.S.-Israeli friendship "that cannot ever be broken" and the two
nations' common purpose in fighting terrorism. But Powell clearly has
deep differences with Israel too.</TE>
<TE>   Despite two weeks of daily U.S. and international pressure to withdraw
from Palestinian territories, Sharon is standing firm on continuing the
Israeli offensive. Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres pointed out
Friday that the original plans called for four weeks of military
operations in Palestinian areas, only half of which has passed.</TE>
<TE>   "In many places, most of the mission was accomplished or are on the
verge of being accomplished, so we are not talking about months, we are
not talking about years--we are talking about a week or something a
little bit more than that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell urged Sharon to end the operation quickly. "As a friend of
Israel, we have to take note of the long-term strategic consequences of
the incursions that are underway and their effect on the nations in the
region and the international climate," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary also pressed Sharon on the importance of launching a
political process that will lead to a final settlement with the
Palestinians as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   An essential part of the process is eventually getting Sharon and
Arafat to discuss a solution that leads to a Palestinian state. But, in
another bad omen, Sharon said Friday that he cannot reach peace with
Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "With him we cannot reach any settlement; therefore, I believe that
[there] should have been an effort to find somebody else with whom it
would be possible," he said in an interview with CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the political stubbornness and security setbacks, Powell said
Friday that he is prepared to stay as long as it takes to get results.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Companies Hired to Train Foreign Armies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>When the Pentagon talks about training the new Afghan National
Army, it doesn't mean with its own soldiers. The Green Berets and other
elite U. S. troops are needed elsewhere. Instead, the Defense Department
is drawing up plans to use its commandos to jump-start the Afghan force,
then hire private military contractors to finish the job.</LD>
<LD>   It would be the most vital role yet taken on by a somewhat clandestine
industry accustomed to operating on the fringe of U. S. foreign policy by
training foreign armies. As the United States pushes its antiterrorism
campaign beyond Afghanistan, the role of these private companies promises
to grow right along with it.</LD>
<LD>   "The war on terrorism is the full employment act for these guys," said
D. B. Des Roches, spokesman for the Pentagon's Defense Security
Cooperation Agency.</LD>
<TE>   A little-known but increasingly essential addition to the modern
battlefield, the firms, studded with retired American generals, have been
training the world's more ragtag armies since the 1970s when a group of
Vietnam veterans discovered that there was money to be made marketing
military expertise--and sold Saudi Arabia on a plan to teach its army how
to guard its oil fields.</TE>
<TE>   Business has burgeoned in the messy post-Cold War world. The
firms--modern-day mercenary companies armed with Powerpoint presentations
instead of weapons--operate today in more than 40 countries, often under
contract to the U. S. government.</TE>
<TE>   For the Pentagon, with one-third fewer soldiers than a decade ago but
a growing number of entanglements in unlikely places, hiring out the
training of foreign armies has become indispensable. Every U. S. military
operation in the post-Cold War era has involved significant levels of
support from private military firms, from the Persian Gulf to Somalia,
Zaire, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo and Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   But the industry has met with growing criticism by military experts
who charge that the firms work with little oversight and less
accountability, particularly when hired by foreign governments.</TE>
<TE>   Plans to use the firms in Afghanistan are still preliminary. Although
training of an Afghan military force has begun, there is no timetable for
turning the task over to contractors. With Afghanistan still volatile,
Pentagon officials are grappling with just how private trainers, who
typically do not carry weapons, should be employed.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11 and the Pentagon's launch of the war on terrorism, the
stock prices of the publicly traded contractors have soared. Already,
trainers from private military companies are in the former Soviet
republic of Georgia, where Al Qaeda operatives are believed to be hiding.
Executives of several private military companies have met with Pentagon
officials about training other armies in Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have said, 'Ding ding ding, gravy train,' " Des
Roches said. "But in point of fact, it makes sense. They're probably
better at doing these sorts of missions than anyone else I could think
of."</TE>
<TE>   Boasts retired Army Lt. Gen. Harry E. Soyster, an executive at MPRI,
the most prominent of the private contractors: "We've got more generals
per square foot here than in the Pentagon."</TE>
<TE>   Although the most successful of the U. S. firms carefully screen their
employees, prohibit them from carrying arms and generally reject
contracts with governments the U. S. considers unsavory, they operate in
a world populated by a darker breed of ex-soldiers who serve as guns for
hire to thugs throughout the world. Competing military companies in
Britain and South Africa have hired out their employees as combatants in
Angola and Sierra Leone. And employees of the U. S. companies have
sometimes taken up weapons themselves, employees of the firms say.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about places where the governments have very little
control over their territory . . . where our government has no control
over what these firms tell the sometimes very questionable people they
work for about how to fight," said Deborah Avant, professor of political
science at George Washington University and an authority on the role of
the private sector in war. "The more and more we put these people in
riskier and riskier areas, the more they have to make these judgments on
their own."</TE>
<TE>   The U. S.-based companies say their goals dovetail with a long-held U.
S. policy of encouraging military-to-military ties worldwide in the hope
that professional armies can help stabilize fragile democracies.</TE>
<TE>   MPRI, founded in 1988 by former Army Chief of Staff Carl Vuono and
seven other retired generals, has trained militaries throughout the world
under contract to the Pentagon. It counts 20 former senior military
officers on its board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   The firm operates from a bland office building in Alexandria, Va., its
halls as hushed as those of an insurance firm. But the decor betrays the
tough credentials of its founders. A statue of a knight in armor stands
in a corner of the lobby. MPRI's emblem is an unsheathed sword.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are not about to destroy reputations they've spent 30
years building just for a buck," said Soyster, who once headed the
Defense Intelligence Agency. "We go someplace because we are either sent
there by the U. S. government or we're contracted by another government.
We do it for the money, I'm not ashamed to say. But we do it right."</TE>
<TE>   The financial rewards presumably beat Pentagon salaries. Since Sept.
11, the per-share price of stock in L3 Communications, which owns MPRI,
has more than doubled.</TE>
<TE>   The top five executives at Science Applications International Corp. of
San Diego made between $825,000 and $1.8 million in salaries in 2001, and
each held more than $1.5 million worth of stock options.</TE>
<TE>   Revenues from the global international security market, of which the
firms are a part, are expected to rise from $55.6 billion in 1990 to $202
billion in 2010, according to a 1997 study by Equitable Services Corp., a
security industry analyst.</TE>
<TE>   The renting out of trained killers dates back hundreds of years, and
privately recruited regiments were common in the U. S. Civil War. But
selling military expertise has its roots in Vietnam, when commercial
teams funded by the Pentagon provided military and police training to
South Vietnamese forces.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, McLean, Va.-based Vinnell Corp. won a $77-million contract to
train Saudi Arabian infantry and artillery battalions to defend oil
fields. It was the first time that American civilians had been permitted
to sell military training directly to a foreign military. The job was
controversial, and Senate Democrats held hearings. But the contract
stuck. And other similar firms began to emerge.</TE>
<TE>   The end of the Cold War led to dramatic growth. Suddenly, there was a
pool of skilled former officers, some from Special Forces units, eager to
sell the expertise they had developed as relatively low-paid soldiers.
They found a ready market at the Pentagon, and in dozens of countries in
Africa, Asia and the former Soviet sphere eager to professionalize their
militaries.</TE>
<TE>   The major U. S. firms in the field include MPRI, Vinnell, BDM
International Inc. of Fairfax, Va., Armor Holdings Inc. of Jacksonville,
Fla.; DynCorp of Reston, Va., and SAIC. Armor Holdings was among Fortune
magazine's 100 fastest-growing companies in 1999 and 2000, one of the few
firms on the list not related to technology.</TE>
<TE>   The people they hire are hardly soldiers of fortune.</TE>
<TE>   They are generally former military officers with 20 to 30 years of
experience, generously pensioned retirees for whom the money is just part
of the allure. Many describe their work as public service, a way to
practice military diplomacy. Often they freelance, taking on contracts
that send them abroad for a year or so.</TE>
<TE>   They train armies how to use such complex hardware as armored
personnel carriers, surface-to-air missiles, shoulder-fired antitank
missiles, ships and aircraft, and other equipment typically sold to
foreign armies by the United States. They prep officers in military
strategy, run battle simulation centers, and have helped support
peacekeeping efforts in troubled regions under contract to the Pentagon
and the State Department.</TE>
<TE>   MPRI has trained military forces in dozens of countries, including
Croatia, Bosnia, Macedonia and Colombia. DynCorp trained the Haitian
police force after the 1994 U. S. intervention in the island nation. And
MPRI and several other firms, under contract to the State Department,
established the African Center for Strategic Studies to teach fledgling
democracies how to run professional armies.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the French Foreign Legion they are not.</TE>
<TE>   "One leitmotif of the business is how boring the individual jobs can
be on almost all of the contracts that the big U. S. firms have. It is
like being in the peacetime Army, Navy or Air Force," said one former
member of Special Forces and airborne infantry units who for more than
two decades has trained foreign militaries in Indochina and the Middle
East.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a mercenary," this trainer said. "I like excitement, but I
have to be on the side of angels. Do not look for me to look for
excitement [by] working on the side of vicious people."</TE>
<TE>   But even the most polished of the firms have blemished histories.
Employees of DynCorp were fired after being accused two years ago of
keeping Bosnian women as concubines. Companies hired by the CIA in the
1980s trained foreign fighters later charged with atrocities in El
Salvador and Honduras.</TE>
<TE>   When the firms are hired by the Pentagon or State Department, as they
would be in Afghanistan, their work is audited and sometimes supervised
by U. S. military personnel, a process the State Department says helps
prevent abuse.</TE>
<TE>   But when they sell their services directly to other countries, there
are minimal controls.</TE>
<TE>   The only U. S. regulation of such foreign contracts is through the
State Department, which issues export licenses under the Arms Export
Control Act. The law regulates the sale of military services just as it
does the export of a crate of guns. The department reviews applications
to ensure that no sales are made or services performed that would
"undercut U. S. interests," spokesman Jason Greer said.</TE>
<TE>   The firms say this prevents them from working with governments that
the U. S. disapproves of. When MPRI tried to get a license to train the
Angolan army in 1994, for example, the State Department turned it down.</TE>
<TE>   But Congress is notified only of contracts worth more than $50
million. Sometimes there are conflicting views of what is in the U. S.
interest. And once a license is granted, there are no reporting
requirements or oversight of work that typically lasts years and takes
the firms' employees to remote, lawless areas.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, MPRI applied for a license to help the government of
Equatorial Guinea build its coast guard. The tiny African country is run
by a military dictator who has been implicated in human rights abuses. It
has no U. S. Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   The contract was initially rejected by two State Department desks,
according to a department official and Soyster. But the decision was
reversed two years later after MPRI lobbyists argued that if it was not
allowed to do the job, a competitor from another country would.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who think you should not help people, that they
don't deserve to be helped, even though they want to make a change,"
Soyster said. "We say, don't let past mistakes get in the way of doing
something that should be done today."</TE>
<TE>   Even when doing the job they describe, the firms' role is sometimes
cloudy.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, during a U. N. embargo on arms sales to Croatia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Yugoslavia, MPRI persuaded the State Department to
grant it a license to train Croatia's military, pledging that it would
teach only leadership skills, budgeting and military ethics.</TE>
<TE>   When the Croatian military, in a highly effective offensive called
Operation Storm, captured the Serb-held Krajina enclave later that year,
there were suspicions that MPRI instructors must have been directly
involved. The operation played a key role in reversing the tide of war
against the Serbs and, consistent with American policy, in bringing both
sides to the negotiating table. But the same Croatian military was
subsequently implicated in uprooting more than 150,000 Serbs from their
homes.</TE>
<TE>   The company denies that its employees played any direct role in the
Croatian army's sudden transformation into an effective fighting force.</TE>
<TE>   "I can assure you if we had the capability to train an army in a month
to turn it around that fast, I wouldn't be talking to you, I'd be flying
you over to the Riviera on the way to see it for yourself," Soyster said.
"If we could do that to Croatia, we could straighten out Afghanistan in a
couple of months."</TE>
<TE>   But critics charge that the help MPRI provided the Croatians may have
allowed the U. S. to secretly influence events in the war while
maintaining its neutral posture and without sending U. S. troops,
advisors or trainers.</TE>
<TE>   "MPRI had all these different meetings with top Croatian defense
officials right before the offensive. It's inconceivable that they did
not have some kind of impact," said one military analyst who has followed
the company's involvement in the Balkans. "It was followed by massive
ethnic cleansing. Now, had American troops been on the ground, we would
have been held accountable for that. The fact that it was a private
company made the connection a lot less clear."</TE>
<TE>   In this murky world, the line between training foreign troops and
fighting with them sometimes blurs.</TE>
<TE>   When Saddam Hussein's army invaded the Saudi Arabian border town of
Khafji in February 1991, Vinnell employees accompanied Saudi national
guard units into combat, according to two employees of Vinnell and an
employee of another private military company who was in Saudi Arabia at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   The Vinnell employees had been stationed in the region to instruct
Saudi soldiers in operating heavy weapons systems.</TE>
<TE>   "Their job was to teach those guys, not to fight with them, but sure,
the Vinnell instructors accompanied those units into combat," an employee
who witnessed the counterattack said. "Under extraordinary circumstances,
but very, very rare circumstances, you will see employees of the MPRIs of
this world get into a circumstance where they can't say no. . . . Let's
face it, they're human beings."</TE>
<TE>   Said Vinnell spokesman Kevin O'Melia: "I'm not aware that that
happened, and our company policy is that they not be directly involved.
They're hired as advisors only . . . and that's the capacity in which we
expect them to act."</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, the plan is for up to 150 U. S. Special Forces troops
to begin training Afghan recruits, then to turn the effort over to
private U. S. contractors. Defense officials have said for months that
only by having an army of its own can Afghanistan hope to create the
stability that is critical if the country is to avoid remaining a haven
for terrorists. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has said he might
seek money from Congress and other foreign governments to finance the
army.</TE>
<TE>   Some basic training of several hundred Afghan recruits is already
underway, led by British and German members of the international security
force there.</TE>
<TE>   But thousands of other potential Afghan soldiers have yet to be
tapped, and international financial support for building Afghanistan's
army has been slim.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how large an Afghan force would be needed to suppress
factional conflicts and patrol the country's borders. But some defense
officials have put the number at more than 20,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll start off with our own guys because the Afghans are
more comfortable at this point with people in uniform who they know,"
said a senior defense official familiar with the plan. "But at some point
down the pike, we will move to contractors. We have to. We don't have the
people to do it all ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   And if the corporate warriors succeed in Afghanistan, the Pentagon
will be eager to send them elsewhere, defense officials said.</TE>

<HD>Youths Seek Deadly Rush on State's Rural Roads</HD>
<DH>Drag racing: Despite its dangers, it remains a rite of passage,
aided now with high-tech trappings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRESNO
</DL>
<LD>Like generations of Central Valley youth before them, they had come
to a lonely road in the middle of farm country looking for a shot of
adrenaline. It was past midnight, the cops nowhere to be found, and two
tricked-out cars, engines revving, squared off at the starting line.</LD>
<LD>   A crowd of 300 teens and young adults packed the flat two-lane road
that cleaved a wheat field and an almond orchard. Sitting on lawn chairs
and munching fast food, they craned their necks to get a better look.</LD>
<LD>   But the big race on this Saturday night in late March never took
place.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, according to police and witnesses, a third car happened to be
heading up the same straightaway. The driver, numbed by beer and blinded
by headlights, sideswiped one of the race cars and then plowed into a
cluster of spectators, killing two teenagers and injuring five others.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the hospital helicopter touched down in the field 15 miles
outside Fresno, the crowd had disappeared into the warm spring night. But
the racers and their fans would be back soon enough, police said, if not
on this stretch of rural road, then surely another.</TE>
<TE>   From the farm fields of the San Joaquin Valley, where daring to race
beneath the stars is viewed as almost a rite of passage, to the streets
of San Diego, where speed demons talk in muscle-car lingo and mimic
characters from the movie "The Fast and the Furious," youths in
California are dying in illegal drag races.</TE>
<TE>   In the last five months, at least eight teenagers and young adults
have been killed and nearly two dozen injured while drag racing on
California streets and rural lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Last November, on a narrow road in Merced, three seniors at Golden
Valley High School died while racing a schoolmate. The two cars were
going 100 mph when they collided side-by-side and crashed into an almond
orchard, one car exploding into flames and the other shearing in half.</TE>
<TE>   In January, two young men in San Diego were killed in a similar race.
Last month, a drag racer in Oceanside died after crashing into a palm
tree. And just this month, two junior college students were killed and
six others injured when a group of young men and women challenged one
another to a race on a residential road in Chula Vista. One of the two
souped-up Japanese imports was going 115 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a statewide problem," said Fresno-based California Highway
Patrol Officer Axel Reyes. "It's a big problem in Sacramento and San
Diego, and we're having our share in Fresno, too. We know where they are
and what they're doing, but it's hard to catch them in the act. They've
got police scanners and lookouts, and how do you sneak up on so many
people gathered at 2 in the morning on a country road?</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how many times I've come across them a little too
late. I'll see 50 to 100 cars passing me the other way. What can you do?"</TE>
<TE>Nine Arrested in Last Week's Raid</TE>
<TE>   San Diego is using a $400,000 state grant to create an
anti-drag-racing campaign that includes undercover investigations and
public service announcements warning of the dangers. Last week, police
there arrested nine people and impounded their cars during a Friday night
raid on a suspected illegal drag race location. More than 150 spectators
had gone to the site.</TE>
<TE>   There is no such crackdown planned in the San Joaquin Valley, though
the CHP is looking for ways to add to its graveyard shift of five units
patrolling all of Fresno County. Three years ago, about 300 teens and
young adults, some from as far away as Los Angeles and Arizona, were
caught by Fresno police at a popular drag-racing spot on the outskirts of
town. More than 100 cars were cited for illegal smog systems and exhaust
pipes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about another big operation, but it comes down to
funding and personnel," Reyes said.</TE>
<TE>   It's tempting for parents to believe that kids in this forever farm
belt, looking for ways to spice up life, are simply following a tradition
no different than dragging the Main. This is, after all, the valley that
inspired the movie "American Graffiti," George Lucas' tribute to bored
teens, cruising and street racing.</TE>
<TE>   After decades of population boom, the towns along California 99 stand
more urban than hick. Even so, illegal drag racing remains a popular way
for youths to cap off a weekend night, much as it still does in the
industrial stretches of the San Fernando Valley and Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   But though police say it's impossible to measure whether kids are
racing more today, these hot rods are different from the big Chevys,
Plymouths and Pontiacs that used to burn rubber through the fig orchards
of north Fresno. These machines--Hondas, Toyotas, Nissans and a dwindling
number of American muscle cars that remain popular with purists--have
been rebuilt with special exhaust systems and fuel tanks that turbocharge
the engine.</TE>
<TE>   The crowds that come to see them fly, mobilized by a network of cell
phones, are far bigger and more volatile. After a night of hopping bars
and burger joints or cruising Blackstone Avenue, they're still on the
prowl for a small rush.</TE>
<TE>   A mix of gangbangers, grease monkeys and regular youths in
cars--nudged together by a love of raw speed--line up one behind the
other and head out from the city lights in a funeral-like procession.
Pushed deep into the rural landscape by suburban sprawl, the racers have
grown cocky knowing they can elude the law. Indeed, it's part of the
high.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining a safe distance from each other is another matter.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been to gatherings where all night people go out there and spin
doughnuts and do burnouts, and then I've been to ones where they race
every two minutes for four hours," said Michael Loomis, a 21-year-old
Fresnan who is out of work and plays guitar in a band. "Some nights no
one wants to race, and we just hang out in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Some nights, it's pure "four-banger" imports, four-cylinder Japanese
cars featured in movie "The Fast and the Furious" that cover a
quarter-mile in 17 to 20 seconds. Other nights, it's a nod to America and
the six-cylinder Camaros, Mustangs, Corvettes and Thunderbirds that
finish the same stretch in 12 to 14 seconds.</TE>
<TE>Two Teens Killed at Their First Race</TE>
<TE>   On the night of March 31, Loomis wasn't planning to head to the races.
He and his best friend, 25-year-old Mykal Balderas, had spent the night
drinking a few beers and listening to music at a nightclub in Fresno.
They were driving a third friend to his house on the rural west side when
they noticed the telltale signs of a drag race ahead.</TE>
<TE>   This one, though, was far bigger than any they had seen. Scores of
cars were parked on both sides of Cornelia Avenue, and spectators were
sitting in the weeds beside the farm fields or standing in the road
waiting for the next race to begin.</TE>
<TE>   "Mykal slowed down to 40 mph and all of a sudden we see this car in
our lane and then a bunch of people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "From the time we hit the first person to the time we stopped, I don't
remember much. Just people flying across the windshield and over the car.
I keep having flashbacks."</TE>
<TE>   The two teens who were killed, 14-year-old Jonathon Gomez and
18-year-old Jeffrey Cordova, had never been to a race before. Cordova, a
freshman at Fresno City College, was a business titan in the making,
family and friends said.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since grammar school, when he got the idea of filling his
backpack with store-bought suckers and selling them to fellow students at
a nickel-a-pop profit, he had a knack for making a buck. Day and night,
he read the Wall Street Journal and Forbes magazine and listened to the
motivational tapes of positive-thinking guru Tony Robbins. He opened his
own business helping creditors garnishee wages from consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd wake us up early every morning, 'Get up, you can't make money
sleeping,' " his mother, Cynthia Cervantes, recalled. "He bought his own
Lincoln Town Car when he turned 18. He was headed somewhere big."</TE>
<TE>   Balderas was charged with vehicular manslaughter and jailed on a
$147,000 bond. He has pleaded not guilty. Cervantes, who says she has
forgiven him, now tries to educate the public on the dangers of drag
racing. She is especially disappointed in an off-duty Fresno County
sheriff's deputy who attended the race as a spectator.</TE>
<TE>   The deputy, Don Hendrickson, 29, has been removed from patrol duty
while an internal investigation into his conduct continues.</TE>

<HD>Psychic Industry Didn't See Crackdown Coming</HD>
<DH>Law: Widespread reports of abuses costing callers hundreds of
dollars lead to investigations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY SCHWARTZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To Shlomit Galperin, the future looked bleak. And she wasn't even a
psychic--yet.</LD>
<LD>   She was cleaning houses around St. Petersburg, Fla., to support her
two kids, and there wasn't a lot of money in it. So when she saw the ad
in the Thrifty Nickel--work at home, earn good money, flexible hours--she
made the call.</LD>
<LD>   "You will be a psychic," she recalls the woman telling her.</LD>
<TE>   "What?" she replied.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Galperin is no clairvoyant. If she was, she would have
already known that for the next four years, she was fated to be one of
hundreds of stay-at-home psychics who answered calls on behalf of Miss
Cleo, the exuberant soothsayer with the Jamaican accent whose television
appearances, mostly in late-night commercials, have made her an
extrasensory sensation.</TE>
<TE>   She quit last May, before lawsuits--filed by at least nine states and
the Federal Trade Commission--took a heavy toll on the company's
reputation and profits. They charged the company Miss Cleo represents,
Access Resource Services of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with all sorts of
sins, including lying about Miss Cleo's qualifications as a seer.</TE>
<TE>   But it would be a mistake to focus too much on Miss Cleo. The story
here is a business in which just about everybody has been accused of
sleazy behavior--Access, its contractors, even the people who call for
readings.</TE>
<TE>   And don't forget the psychics.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not too proud of what I did," says Shlomit Galperin.</TE>
<TE>   She recalls how the recruiter sat down with her and two others and
simulated calls. But I don't know how to read Tarot cards, Galperin said.
No problem, she was told: You can read from these scripts. But I'm not a
college graduate, and I can barely speak English, said Israeli-born
Galperin. No problem, she was told: Callers find foreign accents exotic.</TE>
<TE>   So about a week later, Shlomit Galperin, cleaning woman, became
Shlomit Galperin, oracle--for $4.99 a minute. The first three minutes of
soothsaying were on the house.</TE>
<TE>   Her most important job, she says, was not to divine the future--it was
to keep callers on the line. She was required to maintain a 15-minute
average per call (later increased to 20 minutes); when her average
declined, so did the number of calls that were sent her way. She was paid
according to how long she was on the line--at the most, $12 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   There was the caller from Mississippi who was looking for her
retarded, epileptic brother. Galperin knew of only one place in
Mississippi: Jackson. So she said the man was there.</TE>
<TE>   "She thanked me so much. 'Now, I can at least narrow it down,' she
said. So I told her that I saw a two-story brick building," Galperin
says.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's a clinic, the caller suggested. Could be, Galperin agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the caller whose boyfriend told her that her cat had
been run over by a truck. She suspected that the boyfriend had killed the
cat.</TE>
<TE>   Galperin closed her eyes. "Yes!" she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it!" said the caller.</TE>
<TE>   She would use the phone in her son's room during the day, when he was
at school, or even at night, while he did his homework beside her.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no choice. We have to keep people on the line," says Andre
Marmen, a 60-year-old resident of Lake Placid, Fla., who used to work on
a sex line and segued into psychic work. He doesn't do Tarot cards.
Instead, "I'm a clairvoyant, and I'm easy with that."</TE>
<TE>   Does he really have psychic powers? "People want to hear from a
psychic, then I'm a psychic," says Marmen, who is originally from Quebec.
Yes, he has an accent.</TE>
<TE>   Access now insists that all new hires swear ["under penalty of
perjury," says company lawyer Sean Moynihan] that they are genuine
psychics.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that you're honest, legitimate readers. We know that your
gifts are far beyond what the government or the states can even begin to
comprehend," reclusive Access owner Steven Feder says in a taped message
to his psychics.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is always a moment in the company's ads and its phone
messages when we are assured that this is an entertainment product.</TE>
<TE>   "It's supposed to be fun," Moynihan says. "It's supposed to be
enjoyment."</TE>
<TE>   He likens it to the World Wrestling Federation, another form of
entertainment that is not embraced by all. Customers "budget it into
their entertainment dollar; they'll call two or three times a month for a
reading or chat," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Fisher isn't buying it.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, these folks weren't calling to be entertained," says the
Washington state woman who worked as a phone psychic for two days in
1996. She quit after taking two calls--one from a woman who was being
abused by her husband, the other from a crying man who was on the verge
of homelessness and was spending his last dollars to seek career guidance
from a psychic.</TE>
<TE>   Outrageous, says May Chao, head of the New York State Consumer
Protection Board: "Consumers with very real problems reach out to these
so-called psychics, looking for help with money, children, their love
lives and careers."</TE>
<TE>   But Edward Popper, dean of Girard School of Business and International
Commerce at Merrimack College in North Andover, Mass., says there's the
question as to how much government can or should do to protect people who
think they can learn the future by calling a 900 number.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have to protect people from their own stupidity?" asks Popper,
a former staffer at the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have not spent much time worrying about whether Access
psychics--or any psychics--are legit. "We stay out of whether there is
any such thing as a psychic. That for us is a very difficult thing from a
legal standpoint," says Bob Buchner, an assistant attorney general in
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they are focusing on other issues:</TE>
<TE>   * Does Access violate "do not call" laws to drum up business? No,
attorney Moynihan says.</TE>
<TE>   But Access does call a lot, with recorded messages that promise
"amazing" free readings; it also showers customers with e-mail in which
Miss Cleo says she has checked the cards and has urgent news for
them--call right away!</TE>
<TE>   * Is Miss Cleo a Jamaican shaman, as she claims--a student of "all
different types of spirituality," as Moynihan puts it?</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't even attempted to substantiate that," says Buchner. His
office produced a birth certificate for Youree Dell Harris, born at a Los
Angeles hospital. Her parents were from Texas and California.</TE>
<TE>   Miss Cleo could not be reached for comment and her lawyer, William
Cone, did not return a reporter's calls. But the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer reported that Miss Cleo--who has also given her full
name as Youree Cleomili Harris--produced three plays in Seattle in the
1990s and left without paying cast or crew. She used the name Ree Perris,
and had no Jamaican accent.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Stolz, Access' president, has told the Los Angeles Times that
the company is phasing out Miss Cleo as its spokeswoman and replacing her
with more generic psychics.</TE>
<TE>   * Do the psychics resort to chicanery to run up callers' phone bills?</TE>
<TE>   According to Buchner, Access executives will "close their eyes to what
their so-called psychics have to do to keep these people on the line."</TE>
<TE>   Moynihan denies it. He has issued edicts prohibiting psychics from
putting callers on hold, or from reading scripts intended to prolong the
calls. The company occasionally monitors readings, and psychics who break
the rules are fired.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Dominick, a 36-year-old art teacher in Jamestown, N.Y., goes to
a psychic every couple of years. When she saw Miss Cleo's commercials,
she thought, "It's free. What the hey," and she gave the 800 number a
call.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, the operator explains what is about to happen, and gives you
a 900 number. Dial that number, and a recorded preamble explains some
more. And then the live psychic comes on the line; after a few minutes,
there is a beep, and the meter starts running.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the operator nor the psychic is employed by Access directly.
The operator works for West TeleServices of Omaha, Neb. And the psychic
works for an independent contractor, known as a "bookstore," that manages
a stable of seers.</TE>
<TE>   The way Dominick tells it, when she called last November, she was told
that it was a busy night and that if she agreed to stay on hold, she
would be granted an extra 15 free minutes. Over the next hour, she was
repeatedly told to wait and was assured she would not be charged.</TE>
<TE>   Then a tape came on. She had been on the line for the maximum 60
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Click.</TE>
<TE>   Peeved ("I had plans to go somewhere"), she called back. She reached a
psychic named John who assured her that he would give her the reading she
deserved. He jotted down the promise that she would receive 18 minutes
free. They chatted on; at no time, she says, did she hear a tone
signaling that she was about to be charged.</TE>
<TE>   "Aren't I supposed to be hearing something?" she kept asking.</TE>
<TE>   In December, she got the bill: $489, for 98 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Access lawyer, Moynihan, says Dominick apparently didn't listen to
the taped preamble that advised her to press star-911 if she was put on
hold--the call would be disconnected and the psychic reported to
management.</TE>
<TE>   Putting callers on hold "has never been an OK method. That's one of
the things you can be fired for," says Michael Arnone, owner of Bassador
Co., a bookstore in Portland, Ore. "Unfortunately, as with anything,
there are always a few bad apples."</TE>
<TE>   The use of scripts is also a fire-able offense. But Nancy Garen,
author of the book "Tarot Made Easy," has sued Access, charging that
psychics were told to read from her book during their calls. "Sample
readings" abound on the Internet, along with hints that would prolong
calls.</TE>
<TE>   "Listening and questions is the most important part of working the
Psychic Line," suggests Buckwood Communications, a bookstore. "You will
find that many callers actually listen to themselves speak. Let them do
the talking . . . sometimes they figure out their own problems."</TE>
<TE>   All of this is beside the point, says Moynihan.</TE>
<TE>   "The ultimate arbiter here is the caller, right?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens if they're dissatisfied with the call, if they don't
think they're getting what they called for, what they want? . . . The
answer is simple. They hang up the phone."</TE>
<TE>   The caller also has the upper hand in another way too. When Dominick
got the bill for her brush with the psychic world, she complained to AT &amp;
T, which had carried the call and processed the bill. AT &amp; T said it
would remove the charge.</TE>
<TE>   AT &amp; T does this a lot, which is one of the reasons AT &amp; T is getting
out of the business of billing for 900 numbers. The telephone
company--and Access--have lost millions of dollars as a result of these
"charge-backs," often prompted when callers flat-out deny they called.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how often people call up and say, 'Nobody from my
house made this call,' " says Moynihan. "It may be a wife. A teenage
daughter. A housekeeper, a baby sitter who made the call and is afraid to
fess up."</TE>
<TE>   AT &amp; T might cancel the charges, but Access does not--until recently,
the company threatened to take debtors to court, although it never did.</TE>
<TE>   When Dominick failed to pay her $489 bill, she got a letter demanding
the money. And when she called Access, a "very nasty" woman told her she
obviously was not very intelligent.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Reeves of Mallory, W.Va., said he hangs up when Access calls to
demand payment of a $154.69 bill charged to his 50-year-old brother,
Jack. Jack lives next door; he's retarded and, his brother says, so
religious that "he would think he was going to hell" for calling a
psychic.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're psychic, they should have known we weren't going to pay
this," Reeves says.</TE>
<TE>   Access' problem is that AT &amp; T only gives it the telephone numbers of
callers; unable to rely on its psychics to divine the identities of
callers, Access must go through directories and match the numbers with
names. Sometimes, there are mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a multimillion-dollar business," says Buchner. "It could be
thousands [of errors]. It could be hundreds of thousands, even."</TE>
<TE>   When callers complain about a competing psychic hot line operated by
Billy Tide, the 33-year-old Florida man just writes off the charges, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Tide isn't entirely on the up and up, either. His psychic star is
"Miss Chloe."</TE>
<TE>   "It's deceptively similar," he admits.</TE>
<TE>   (It should be noted that Tide was confined to his West Palm Beach home
when he was interviewed; he has been imprisoned for much of the past two
years after violating a restraining order keeping him away from Access'
Feder, for whom he says he worked in the early 1990s. Feder would not be
interviewed for this story.)</TE>
<TE>   "We basically are the same kind of scam," says Tide, 33. "We admit the
psychic thing is a scam and a rip-off."</TE>
<TE>   A rip-off? Yes, says Glenn Schwenk, a 42-year-old supervisor of a
county cleaning crew in Kingston, N.Y. He says he never heard the beep
signaling the end of his free minutes during his reading one night in
December, and was charged $55.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll suffer the consequences," he was told, when he refused to pay.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, Schwenk liked Miss Cleo when he saw her on a pay-per-view
special: "She was excellent."</TE>
<TE>   He wouldn't say what Miss Cleo's psychic told him, but it was good
news and it had something to do with his love life and it is supposed to
happen by summer.</TE>
<TE>   He'll just wait and see.</TE>

<HD>Operation Anaconda Leaves a Bitter Legacy</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Many residents of war-torn land blame U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GARDEZ, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Every morning, a forlorn procession of the bereft and the defeated
gathers at the gates of the pale yellow governor's compound in this
weather-beaten provincial outpost.</LD>
<LD>   There are widows and orphans and stooped old men, all of them bearing
tales of misery and loss written in flowing Persian script on slips of
paper. These are sullen, bitter people.</LD>
<LD>   "They are so angry, angry at the Americans," said Gen. Sahib Jan
Loodin Alozai, the deputy governor of Paktia province, who processes the
complaints. "They blame the Americans for all their troubles."</LD>
<TE>   Nearly a month has passed since American-led Operation Anaconda ended
here in the silver-capped mountains of southeastern Afghanistan. Now the
Americans are targets of residual hate and resentment in a province where
support for the Taliban and Al Qaeda remains strong.</TE>
<TE>   Some petitioners claim that American airstrikes killed their
relatives. Others claim that their homes were destroyed by American bombs
or missiles. Farmers complain that American soldiers have blocked access
to their fields, ruining their spring planting season. People on the
street glare and curse at passing American reporters. A Canadian reporter
was seriously wounded last month by a grenade tossed into her vehicle a
few miles outside town.</TE>
<TE>   This is Pushtun country. Many people here are hostile to foreigners
and sympathetic to the Pushtun-dominated Taliban. In their view, the
Americans are Christian invaders who installed an interim government in
Kabul dominated by the Pushtuns' ethnic rivals, Tajiks from the north.</TE>
<TE>   In place of routed Taliban fighters, the Americans have helped install
Pushtun commanders and fighters of the Tajik-dominated Northern Alliance
in and around Gardez. These veterans of Afghan civil wars teamed with the
American-led coalition forces to drive Taliban and Al Qaeda forces from
their redoubt in the Shahi Kot valley, 25 miles southeast of here.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the enemy on the run, the Americans and their Afghan allies
are confronting a wellspring of sympathy for the Taliban that allows the
guerrillas to feed and arm themselves while they regroup. Unsigned
leaflets, known as shabnama, or "night letters," have appeared urging
Afghans to kill or kidnap foreign--especially American--journalists,
soldiers or aid workers.</TE>
<TE>   According to local officials, Taliban and Al Qaeda survivors have
withdrawn to the south and east, into the mountains of neighboring
Paktika province. They say others have retreated across the lawless
frontier to the Pakistani Pushtun tribal area known as Waziristan.</TE>
<TE>   But some are still active in the Shahi Kot valley, according to Capt.
Steven O'Connor, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition forces. O'Connor
said rockets were fired several miles from coalition troops on April 3,
causing no casualties but heightening fears of an enemy resurgence. The
incident took place near "the Whale," a large hill in the Shahi Kot
valley that was the site of fierce fighting in early March.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Tony de Reya, a British intelligence officer, said Taliban and Al
Qaeda fighters are engaged in a "tactical pause." He said there are
"large groupings of Al Qaeda in certain areas of operation," but declined
to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Rahim, a U.S.-backed commander in Gardez, said that while there
may be as many as 900 surviving Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters to the
south and east, there are none left in his town.</TE>
<TE>   "The only Al Qaeda and Taliban around here are dead ones," Rahim said
over a steaming lunch of meat and rice inside a command post where AK-47s
and rocket-propelled grenade launchers were stacked along the walls.</TE>
<TE>   Rahim, a wiry little man with a hooked nose and a deep sunburn, said
his men continue to find enemy corpses, weapons, ammunition and training
manuals inside caves in the valley. About 50 caves have been cleared and
destroyed and a handful of suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters
captured, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The bodies and the prisoners, we give to the Americans," Rahim said.
"The weapons and ammunition, we keep."</TE>
<TE>   American and coalition forces are conducting "clearance operations"
south and east of the Shahi Kot valley, Rahim said. Special Forces troops
launch missions from an adobe fortress guarded by Afghan gunmen on the
southern outskirts of Gardez. From time to time, American helicopters
swoop low over the rooftops, headed south in search of signs of the
enemy.</TE>
<TE>   But in Gardez, many consider the Americans the enemy. Two incidents,
in particular, have stoked passions here.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 20, American warplanes killed 50 to 60 people in a convoy in
Paktia. Survivors said the victims were tribal elders headed to Kabul for
the inauguration of interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai. The Pentagon
said the dead were Taliban who had opened fire on the planes.</TE>
<TE>   On March 6, the Pentagon has acknowledged, women and children were
among 14 people killed by an American airstrike on an Al Qaeda convoy
fleeing the Shahi Kot valley. The civilians were Al Qaeda family members
traveling with fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "There were women and children in that convoy," Sayed Aminullah, an
Afghan worker for CARE International in Gardez, said of the March attack.
"You don't drop bombs on them, whatever the reason."</TE>
<TE>   Aminullah said that while he and many others in Gardez are grateful to
the Americans for removing the Taliban, and especially the foreigners of
Al Qaeda, "the killing of innocents has filled everyone with anger."</TE>
<TE>   Local officials claim, variously, that a dozen, 50, or more than 100
civilians were killed by American ordnance during Operation Anaconda.
Alozai, the deputy governor, said he had processed 12 death claims but
anticipates more. Townspeople say the numbers are much higher. With
bodies buried and witnesses dispersed, an accurate total probably will
never emerge.</TE>
<TE>   "Not even the angels know the correct number," Aminullah said.</TE>
<TE>   In Kabul, the Ministry of Martyrs and the Disabled tries to track
civilian war deaths nationwide. But the agency's deputy minister, Baz
Mohammed Zormati, said the Gardez region has not been surveyed because
his employees are afraid to travel there.</TE>
<TE>   Zormati, a Pushtun from Zormat, just south of Gardez, said he, too,
refuses to go to Gardez. He supported the North Alliance, he said, and a
bounty was put on his head by Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, who
remains at large.</TE>
<TE>   "If I went," he said, "maybe I would not return alive."</TE>
<TE>   Both the deputy governor and another local CARE official, Mohammed
Rahim, say the homes of 200 to 300 people from 50 to 60 families were
destroyed by American warplanes. Most of those homes were being used as
military posts by Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters who had evicted villagers
in the Shahi Kot valley, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The families have besieged the governor's office with demands for
American compensation, Alozai said. He said he relayed their complaints
to "Mister Mike," his American military contact in Gardez, but received
no reply. American officials say the State Department and Pentagon are
studying the issue but have reached no decision.</TE>
<TE>   Alozai, a Pushtun who took office six weeks ago, said the Americans
did not consult local officials before launching Operation Anaconda.</TE>
<TE>   If they had, he said, they might have negotiated a Taliban and Al
Qaeda surrender, although U.S. commanders have said the enemy refused to
surrender even when trapped or wounded. And several months earlier,
Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters apparently slipped away while negotiations
on a surrender were underway farther north in Tora Bora.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans didn't show respect for our customs, and that has left
a bitter taste," Alozai said. The experience stirred his memories of the
Russian misadventure in Afghanistan, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, the people in Gardez need foreigners to hate," Alozai said.
"They used to hate the Russians. Now they hate the Americans."</TE>
<TE>   He looked up from his tea at an American reporter seated in his
drawing room. "Actually," he said, "you should not be here. I cannot
guarantee your safety."</TE>
<TE>   Even Rahim, the commander, said he was not entirely satisfied with the
conduct of his American patrons.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he said, he had good relations with his American liaison officer,
"Commander Brent." And, yes, he fought alongside the Americans at Shahi
Kot, and 130 of his 600 fighters are being trained by the Americans, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But still, he said, it pains him that American warplanes killed
civilians when they attacked a Taliban munitions depot in the settlement
of Qalaye Niazy near Gardez on Dec. 29. Rahim claimed that 100 civilians
living nearby were killed along with enemy fighters, but he offered no
proof.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans never said they were sorry, or that they made a
mistake," Rahim said. "They just said every dead person was Taliban or Al
Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   He shook his head vigorously. "This is my area. I know the people. I
know who's Taliban and who's Al Qaeda. These were just ordinary people."</TE>
<TE>   An American reporter was escorted to the site, down a rocky dirt track
northwest of Gardez, by one of Rahim's soldiers, a pimply-faced young man
with an automatic rifle slung across his back. After complaining that his
commander had yet to pay him a single afghani in salary, the soldier,
Shaneef Shah, 22, led the way to a settlement of five flattened mud
compounds.</TE>
<TE>   Beside the ruins, nomads known as Kochis had pitched their tents.
Women in red and crimson robes squatted in the dirt, their camels
tethered to stakes.</TE>
<TE>   The largest compound had been the home of a Kochi who had served as a
Taliban commander, Shah said. He had gathered weapons and ammunition
abandoned by fellow Taliban during their retreat from Gardez and trucked
them to his compound.</TE>
<TE>   When American warplanes flattened the depot in a series of strikes
Dec. 29, Shah said, the commander and several Taliban were killed, but so
were civilians in nearby homes. Shah said local Kochis estimated the
number of dead at 50, as did a recent U.N. report.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, 16 graves had recently been dug, their white mourning flags
whipping in the fierce desert wind. Shah said other victims had been
taken elsewhere and buried.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the ammunition had survived the air strike. There were
footlockers stuffed with new anti-tank rockets, still wrapped in
protective plastic sleeves. There were hundreds of gray ammunition boxes
packed with well-oiled anti-aircraft rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why his commanders had not gathered the ammunition for their own
use, Shah replied. "Because it's sitting in the middle of a mine field."</TE>
<TE>   Shah suddenly grew anxious, but not because of mines. He said he
feared Kochi gunmen would arrive to find an American poking through Kochi
homes that had been bombed by American planes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid for you," he told the American. "And for me, too."</TE>

<HD>A Trail of Destruction Scars Nablus' Old City</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>For all the destruction inflicted on Palestinian property by a
2-week-old military onslaught, nothing pains Arafat Hinno like what he
sees in the old city of Nablus.</LD>
<LD>   Structures hundreds of years old--a Byzantine basilica, Ottoman-era
domed roofs, a convent and thick-walled stone houses--were damaged in
Israel's pursuit of Palestinian gunmen. The casbah, as the old city is
known, is now a mess of dangling wires and cables, water gushing from
broken pipes, and thick dust that chokes the air and coats everything in
sight.</LD>
<LD>   "A modern city can be rebuilt--it's nothing special," said Hinno, a
native of the casbah. "But an old town, with its historic places, this is
the most miserable thing."</LD>
<TE>   Among the buildings destroyed by Israeli tank fire or bulldozers was
the casbah home of the Shobi family. The Shobis were still inside when
the Israelis attacked, neighbors said. On Saturday, rescue workers who
for days had been digging through the rubble retrieved the bodies of
three of the Shobi children and their mother; the body of the father,
Samir Shobi, was found Friday. Three other family members also were
killed.</TE>
<TE>   But also Saturday, rescuers discovered two other members of the family
still alive. The rescuers plucked the couple--Abdullah Shobi and his
wife, Shamsa--from their living room, which was under a mass of stone and
dirt.</TE>
<TE>   The recoveries seemed to bolster allegations that the Israeli army--as
it invaded towns and cities across the West Bank and met stiff
resistance--bulldozed homes with people still in them. Similar tales have
emerged from the Jenin refugee camp, site of the most widespread
destruction and highest death toll in any of the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   An army spokeswoman said Saturday that efforts are always made to
notify the residents of a home that is to be demolished. She said the
army destroys only buildings that have been used as explosives factories
or sniper positions.</TE>
<TE>   The Shobis' neighbors gave a different account. Although fighting,
gunfire and explosions had raged for days, the family was not involved.
The neighbors said the bulldozer approached from the plaza in front of
the Shobi home and began attacking. The building collapsed, with the
family inside.</TE>
<TE>   "They were shouting, 'Help us! Help us!' " neighbor Amani Ghanem said
of the crushed people. "We tried to help them."</TE>
<TE>   Nablus is the Palestinians' largest city, and it was the cradle of
both intifadas: The 1987 uprising started here, and the core armed
leaders of the current Palestinian revolt came from Nablus. It has always
been a politically charged city, home to unions, refugees and militants.
The old city dates to the Roman Empire.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians such as Hinno, a former activist with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement who works for an
insurance company, say Israel's assault on Nablus was an attack on the
historical and the cultural parts of Palestinian society, as well as an
attack on its traditional spirit of resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Hinno comes from a family that has lived in the old city "for 800
years." His sister Rokaya lives in what was one of the first houses to be
searched by Israeli troops who invaded last week. The family was herded
into a single room. Her brother was taken away. (He was one of about
4,000 Palestinian men who have been detained in Israel's sweep for
suicide bombers and other terrorists, but he was later released.)</TE>
<TE>   Rokaya said that as soon as the soldiers left, she peered out her door
and down the street. She saw Abu Talad, a white-haired policeman from the
Gaza Strip, dead in what she described as a kneeling position. She saw
another man, Imad Kasua, trapped under the ruins of his house, bleeding
to death.</TE>
<TE>   The three-story Kasua house was one of several private homes that had
been hit by tank rounds or heavy-caliber machine-gun fire, or had been
torched. Saladin the Great Mosque, built from a Byzantine basilica,
apparently had been rammed by a tank or bulldozer. The 250-year-old St.
Demetrius convent was badly damaged by tank fire, Father Economus George
Awad said. The 56-year-old priest said he had to crawl out of the
building to safety.</TE>
<TE>   Two turn-of-the-century soap factories received the heaviest
destruction in the old city. Soap was once Nablus' main export, renowned
for the way it was made. Underneath the landmark factories, the army
says, Palestinian militants had constructed an explosives lab, one of 13
discovered in the old city.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian residents are convinced that the army used F-16 warplanes
to bomb the factories. The army says that it used only tank shells and
that internal explosions from the bomb-making materials caused the more
extensive damage.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the explanation, the 75-yard-long gash in the middle of the
old city testifies to utter destruction. It contains a vast pile of
rubble. Residents say a cabal of fighters was hiding at the soap factory
when Israel attacked, and they believe that bodies remain underneath the
ruins.</TE>
<TE>   And once they finished with the old city, Israeli tanks and troops
moved into the modern part of Nablus, trashing cars, medians and
roadways.</TE>
<TE>   The army said the city offered some of the fiercest resistance of the
campaign, although only one soldier was killed, and probably by friendly
fire. The Palestinian dead included Ahmed Tabouk, a veteran Fatah Hawk,
or member of a militant faction from the first intifada. He used to
swagger about Nablus, heavily armed and decidedly unchallenged, residents
say.</TE>
<TE>   Tabouk and Hinno were vaguely associated during the first intifada and
had gone to school together. Hinno, however, chose to stick with
politics. He was jailed by the Israelis 16 times during the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The ordeal of the estimated 20,000 people who live in the old city is
not likely to weaken their resolve, Hinno said.</TE>
<TE>   "Who will give us our liberation?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke after guiding visitors on a tour of the battered old city,
a stream of homeless Palestinians staggered from the maze-like warren of
alleyways, buildings and shops.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what to do," said one woman, dressed in a pink
traditional Arabic robe. "I have no place to live. I am sick. I am
tired."</TE>

<HD>Arafat Condemns Terror; Powell Meeting Back On</HD>
<DH>Mideast: 'We want deeds, not words,' a Sharon aide says. Hamas vows
more attacks. Israel continues West Bank incursion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>After weeks of resisting U.S. requests, Yasser Arafat on Saturday
condemned all violence and terrorism carried out against civilians,
leading Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to reschedule his meeting with
the Palestinian Authority president for today at his besieged
headquarters in the West Bank.</LD>
<LD>   "We strongly condemn the violent operations that target Israeli
civilians, especially the recent operation in Jerusalem," the statement
said, referring to a suicide bombing Friday that killed six Israelis and
injured scores at a busy outdoor market here.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to all work together . . . to stop the war" and relaunch the
peace process, the statement said. Arafat's long-awaited denunciation of
terrorism had taken on particular importance because the latest bombing
was claimed by the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia linked to the
Palestinian leader's Fatah movement.</LD>
<TE>   Arafat's statement contained "a number of interesting and positive
elements" that led Powell to decide to make the trip today to the West
Bank city of Ramallah, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told
reporters traveling with the secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher commended Arafat's statement, which was issued after the
Palestinian leader met with his top aides at his battered office
compound, for its condemnation of terrorism, commitment to a negotiated
peace, support for the Powell mission and call for immediate
implementation of two earlier plans on security and a political
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials refused to say that Arafat had met the
long-standing U.S. demand to renounce terrorism and rein in the militants
who have been behind a wave of 110 suicide bombings over the last 18
months. The value of Arafat's statement will be determined "by what
action follows," Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   In their meeting, Powell will press Arafat to "show leadership" and
"make these statements a reality with effective action" by ending the
wave of terror against Israel and participating in an "early resumption
of a political process," Boucher added.</TE>
<TE>   America's top diplomat still faces daunting obstacles in making even
minimal progress on his Mideast rescue mission.</TE>
<TE>   After Arafat's statement was issued, the militant Islamic group Hamas
pledged to continue its campaign of violence against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the full right to react without any limitation against the
state terrorism of Israel," said Hamas spokesman Ismail abu Shanab. Hamas
is the second of three groups behind the spate of bombings. Islamic Jihad
is the third.</TE>
<TE>Communique Attacks Israeli Actions</TE>
<TE>   And for all the positive words in Arafat's communique, it was also
filled with bitter accusations about Israel's "choking siege." It charged
that Israel was trying to "squash our people's quest for freedom" with
tanks, warplanes and artillery. And it appealed to Powell, as well as
United Nations and other international officials, to survey the areas
under Israeli occupation for evidence of the "massacres and blood baths
plaguing our people."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the government of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said
it was "not impressed" with the statement and rejected Arafat's words as
duplicitous.</TE>
<TE>   "We want deeds, not words," said Danny Ayalon, a senior foreign policy
advisor to Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   "They are sending the suicide attacker to Jerusalem, giving her
instructions and financing. They cannot keep the strategy of terror and
expect us to be impressed by condemnations," he said, referring to the
young female bomber in Friday's attack.</TE>
<TE>   Israel continued to defy U.S. pressure by moving into at least six
additional Palestinian villages or towns in the West Bank on Saturday and
arresting dozens of suspected extremists.</TE>
<TE>   Israel withdrew from Dahariya, but the army announced that troops and
tanks had rolled into the villages of Burkin and Arabe outside Jenin, Bir
Nabala outside Ramallah and Beit Iba, El Baidan and Beit Wazan near
Nablus. The military also remains entrenched in Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus
and Bethlehem, the major West Bank cities, with no signs of an imminent
pullout.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli snipers apparently shot one of the approximately 140
Palestinians barricaded in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.
Speaking by telephone from inside the church, built on the site revered
as Jesus' birthplace, Bethlehem Gov. Mohammed Madani issued an urgent
call to the Israelis to allow in a medical team to save the dying man.
But the Palestinian militia member, Hassan Nasman, died.</TE>
<TE>   Madani said he noticed increased activity by Israeli forces outside
the church, prompting fears that they might initiate a commando raid to
free about 80 priests, monks and nuns inside.</TE>
<TE>   The question of whether Powell would meet with Arafat was decided
after what appeared to be a subtly choreographed sequence of events,
according to Palestinian, Arab and U.S. officials. The diplomatic drama
offered a microcosm of the complex challenges Powell faces--and the
nuanced solutions they required.</TE>
<TE>   To reporters traveling with Powell, there was little doubt that the
secretary would meet with the Palestinian leader. Pressure had been
building on Powell during four earlier legs of his trip to end hints
about looking for alternative leadership because Arafat had been holding
back on reining in the extremists both inside and outside his movement.</TE>
<TE>   In part because of their own constituencies, Arab leaders made it
clear that they were not prepared to support any U.S. peace effort that
might exclude the grand old man of Palestinian politics, who is now a
hero throughout the Arab world. Arafat also has widespread support in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   But the bombing Friday by an 18-year-old seamstress suddenly made it
awkward for Powell to travel the next day to see Arafat, a move labeled
"a tragic mistake" by Sharon even before the attack, without some
catalyst to make it acceptable--namely, a formal renunciation of
violence.</TE>
<TE>   In meetings just hours before the bombing, U.S. officials already
insisted that the time was long past for Arafat to do something about the
escalating attacks. Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher had also
traveled to Ramallah on Friday to press Arafat to issue a blanket
condemnation and begin taking steps to end extremist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But the Palestinians insisted that Arafat needed to consult with his
senior advisors to discuss and draft a statement that would meet the
various demands. The delay in Arafat's statement was due to problems in
arranging for his aides to get through the tight Israeli cordon around
the battered compound, according to Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian
representative in Washington. Those consultations didn't occur until
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for their condemnation of the violence, moreover, the
Palestinians wanted a statement from the United States acknowledging the
impact of Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians, according to Rahman
and other Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "Palestinian public opinion is very resentful that Palestinians have
to condemn violence while Israel is getting away with murder. This makes
Palestinians and the Arab public very angry. Do Israelis have greater
value than Palestinians? Or are we equal?" Rahman asked in an interview
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Witness accounts of widespread destruction, humanitarian crises and
civilian hardships in West Bank villages have been mounting. The
2-week-old Israeli incursion has subjected Palestinian civilians to
"collective punishment," Rene Kosirnik of the International Committee of
the Red Cross told Powell on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole population should not suffer so much," Kosirnik told
reporters after meeting with Powell.</TE>
<TE>   So the solution unfolded Saturday in a sequence of statements.</TE>
<TE>Powell Meets With Aid Groups</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with humanitarian aid groups involved with Palestinian
refugees, Powell called on Israel to exercise the "utmost restraint and
discipline" to ensure that civilians were protected and to "avoid
worsening the already grave conditions inside Palestinian areas."</TE>
<TE>   Powell also called on the Israeli government to allow international
humanitarian aid groups unimpeded access to Palestinian areas and to
permit them to provide basic services, including care for the victims of
the Israeli incursion.</TE>
<TE>   Three hours later, the Palestinian news agency issued a statement
saying that Arafat and the Palestinian leadership "condemn all terrorist
acts, whether they are aimed at Israeli or Palestinian civilians and
whether these terrorist acts are carried out by a state, groups or
individuals."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's statement was released on Palestinian television as well as
on the Al Jazeera network broadcast throughout the Arab world, at least
partially fulfilling a long-standing demand by the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Powell then huddled with his aides at the David Citadel Hotel, which
had witnessed a suicide bombing in December. The bomber's head was flung
through a hotel window, and blood was splattered on the exterior walls.
The attack injured five people.</TE>
<TE>   Almost five hours after Arafat's statement was released, Boucher
summoned American reporters to issue an announcement that the
Powell-Arafat meeting was back on.</TE>

<HD>French Chefs Are Michelin Star-Struck</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN GECKER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>For Emile Jung, it was like a death in the family. "No words can
ease the pain that eats at our hearts and that has killed our spirits,"
he said.</LD>
<LD>   The chef had just lost a Michelin star, demoted from three to two.</LD>
<LD>   Friends filed into Jung's Au Crocodile restaurant in Strasbourg to
offer condolences, and colleagues took out a full-page newspaper ad to
show their support.</LD>
<TE>   In the elite galaxy of France's top restaurants, losing a star in
Michelin's authoritative Red Guide is tantamount to doom. A demotion
drove one chef in the 1970s to suicide, and has driven others to
bankruptcy or despair.</TE>
<TE>   In France, the gastronomic capital of the world, the guide is the food
lover's road map and bible. Even a single Michelin star can double a
restaurant's revenues, and three of them guarantee a chef overnight
celebrity and months of advance reservations.</TE>
<TE>   "For the two months every year before the guide comes out, I can't
sleep," said Marc Veyrat, who replaced Alain Ducasse last year as the
only chef in France with two three-star restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   So intense was the panic this year that for the first time in its
102-year history, Michelin released its ratings two weeks before the
book's publication to halt the rumors.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 guide crowned three newcomers: Jean-Georges Klein's
L'Arnsbourg in northeastern France and two Paris favorites, Guy Savoy and
Ledoyen.</TE>
<TE>   Alain Passard of Arpege recalls the arrival of his third star in 1997
as "the most beautiful day of my life"--a life-altering moment that
"makes you dream differently."</TE>
<TE>   His staff is trained to keep the dream alive. "Are you ready?" the
maitre d' asks at the start of an 11-course lunch. "We will do our best
to regale you."</TE>
<TE>   There is no background music and only a dozen generously spaced tables
at Arpege, across from the Rodin museum in Paris' Left Bank. The
entertainment comes in the form of an avocado and caviar puree scented
with pistachio oil, langoustine raviolis in a delicate consomme, a
perfectly cooked sea bream. Known for his exotic flair, Passard closes
his tasting lunch with his signature dessert: a candied stuffed tomato.</TE>
<TE>   Across town at Ledoyen, the phones have been ringing nonstop, said its
rising young chef, Christian Le Squer.</TE>
<TE>   "Since getting our third star, we have pages and pages of
reservations," said Le Squer, 39. Tables are booking up through June at
Ledoyen, housed in an 18th-century pavilion off the Champs Elysees. "It's
like a wonderful gift from the heavens."</TE>
<TE>   Le Squer is now an instant celebrity in the food world. Like some
other three-star chefs, he may begin referring to himself in the third
person.</TE>
<TE>   One who does is Bernard Loiseau, the celebrated chef of a restaurant
in a small French town. "Bernard Loiseau is a spokesman for French
cuisine," he says of himself. "My third star launched my international
fame."</TE>
<TE>   But each year, the heavens shift mysteriously, as they did this year
for Jung.</TE>
<TE>   "Bravo Emile," consoled the advertisement in his local newspaper,
which told him to always keep "your head in the stars." It was signed:
"The Chefs of Alsace and all your friends."</TE>
<TE>   Michelin didn't explain the demotion. It never does.</TE>
<TE>   Its team of anonymous "inspectors" eat their way through France,
visiting and revisiting thousands of restaurants. They even make spot
checks on toilets. The company's strict secrecy codes bar them from
giving interviews or being photographed. To guarantee anonymity, Michelin
relocates its inspectors at least once a year.</TE>
<TE>   "We've calculated that the possibility of any inspector visiting the
same restaurant happens once every 10 years," said Jean-Frederic Douroux,
a spokesman for the Michelin guide.</TE>
<TE>   Before awarding a three-star rating, Michelin inspectors will have
paid as many as several dozen visits to a restaurant--always in groups of
two or more, so as not to draw attention in fancy restaurants where
people seldom dine alone.</TE>
<TE>   Douroux defines a three-star restaurant as one that offers diners "an
entirely unique experience, and one that we recommend is worth the trip,
no matter where you live in the world." Of the guide's 4,084 listed
restaurants, just 23 have three stars.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of those are in Paris, but the guide's influence is perhaps most
apparent in small French towns like Saulieu, where Loiseau's Cote d'Or
has become a mecca for the world's gourmets.</TE>
<TE>   "Russians come here, Australians, Americans, and they all come
carrying their Michelin guides," said Loiseau, whose Web site appears in
French, English, Spanish, German and Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   Loiseau's success in his small Burgundy town has spawned a culinary
empire, which he launched a few years ago on the Paris stock exchange. He
has three restaurants in Paris, and his picture appears on a brand of
supermarket frozen dinners. But Loiseau is quick to say that he stays in
the kitchen, in Saulieu.</TE>
<TE>   "Bernard Loiseau has one job," he says. "It's to greet his clients at
his three-star, to manage his three-star and to keep his three stars."</TE>

<HD>Bias Against Gypsies Persists in Europe</HD>
<DH>Lifestyle: In Bulgaria, most are jobless. They are accused of being
too lazy to work, but they contend that no one will hire them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM J. KOLE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PLOVDIV, Bulgaria
</DL>
<LD>A small boy shimmies up a utility pole, gingerly grabs an insulated
cable pulsing with high voltage and connects it to his home: a cube of
corrugated iron sheets in Bulgaria's largest Gypsy slum.</LD>
<LD>   For the 40,000 people living in squalor in the ramshackle Stolipinovo
ghetto on the outskirts of Plovdiv, it has come to this: Their
electricity was shut off because they couldn't pay their bills, so some
have resorted to stealing it.</LD>
<LD>   "We had to light candles. We had to heat with a wood stove. We had to
eat dry food and sausages because we couldn't cook," said Atanas Angelov,
a 73-year-old Gypsy barely making ends meet in Bulgaria's second-largest
city.</LD>
<TE>   "Like most of my neighbors, I'm in despair," he said. "There's nothing
we can do. We're powerless."</TE>
<TE>   From Budapest to Bucharest, from Plovdiv to Prague, life for eastern
Europe's 5 million Gypsies is no easier in the new millennium than it was
in the last one. Amid a growing sense of misery and desperation, some
fear the seeds of future conflict are taking root.</TE>
<TE>   In Romania and Yugoslavia, police routinely abuse and harass Gypsies,
the U.S. State Department said recently in its annual human rights
report. In Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Croatia, far-right skinhead
gangs regularly terrorize Gypsies, who are also known as Roma. Across the
east, half of all Gypsy children never attend school or are forced into
institutions for the mentally deficient, the group Save the Children
says.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is doing anything for the Roma, and that has to stop," said
Antonina Zhelyazkova, who heads the International Center for Minority
Studies and Intercultural Relations in Sofia, Bulgaria's capital.</TE>
<TE>   This formerly communist country can't even agree on how many Gypsies
it has, never mind how to help them.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, there are 350,000 in Bulgaria. But because many call
themselves Turks at census time, the real number is more like 650,000, or
8% of the population, Gypsy activists contend.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 240 seats in parliament, Gypsies hold only two.</TE>
<TE>   Nine in 10 Gypsies are jobless. Many Bulgarians accuse them of being
too lazy to work; Gypsies say no one will hire them.</TE>
<TE>   Krum Mihailov, 32, is an unemployed cook who has been scouring
Plovdiv's newspapers for jobs. He said he found one, called the
restaurant to make an appointment and realized he was the only person to
apply. His hopes soared, only to be dashed.</TE>
<TE>   "They took one look at me and said, 'No, the job is taken,"' he said.
"Once they see we're Gypsies, they don't even want to talk to us."</TE>
<TE>   Plovdiv is an ancient town on the Maritsa River where Turks, Gypsies,
Jews and Bulgarians have lived in harmony for centuries, but frictions
are intensifying.</TE>
<TE>   The local utility company has shut off electricity to the Stolipinovo
slum several times this year because Gypsies aren't paying their bills,
prompting some frustrated Roma to pelt rocks at the lighted windows of
their Bulgarian neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Gypsies reached a deal with city officials, it's not an
easy one: Half of each family's monthly aid of 74 leva ($33) will be
applied to their bills in return for the city's switching the power back
on to their shanties.</TE>
<TE>   "These problems originate with the Gypsies' way of life," said
Plovdiv's mayor, Ivan Chomakov. "Let's face it, no one likes to pay his
bills, but poor Bulgarians pay theirs. There's a lack of values in the
Roma community. They have to play by the rules."</TE>
<TE>   For many Gypsies, those rules changed dramatically in 1992, when
Bulgaria enacted a "restitution law" returning to private hands the lands
that were seized by the state under communism.</TE>
<TE>   Gypsies had to leave their modest homes and their jobs growing
vegetables on state collective farms, where women got prenatal care and
contraceptives and their children got hot meals at school, many making it
at least to the eighth grade.</TE>
<TE>   Illiteracy, which was 9% among Gypsies in 1995, has doubled to 18%.
Life expectancy has dropped: The average Bulgarian lives to age 69; the
average Roma to 55.</TE>
<TE>   "Bulgarians got their land--but now the Gypsies have nothing," said
Zhelyazkova, the activist. "Our politicians turned the Gypsies into
thieves."</TE>
<TE>   Many Gypsies tend to have large families--households of 15 or 20
aren't unusual. They say they're caught in the cruelest of vicious
circles: Because they're unemployed, they can't afford to send their
children to school, and without an education, their children won't find
work.</TE>
<TE>   Although the city of Plovdiv employs about 250 Gypsies as street
sweepers, prospects are poor for the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Some beg, like the man in Sofia with both legs amputated below the
knees, who tapes large foam pads to his stumps and hobbles between two
lines of traffic with his palms outstretched. Or scavenge, like the
elderly woman in rags in Stolipinovo who picks through garbage in a
gutter.</TE>
<TE>   Anton Karagyozov, who runs a Gypsy foundation in Stolipinovo, warns
that if conditions don't improve, social tensions will rise. "There could
be a catastrophe in the next 10 or 15 years."</TE>
<TE>   Things have never seemed so bleak, agrees Asen Kolev, a Gypsy scholar
and philosopher in Plovdiv.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're not careful, the gap between us will widen," he said, "and
we'll never be able to live together anymore."</TE>

<HD>Cairo Zoo Mired in the 19th Century</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Elephants are chained to one spot and a lion licks the
ground for water, but the director denies that changes are needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASPER MORTIMER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>The director calls Cairo's Giza Zoo the best in the world. Foreign
experts think it's close to the worst.</LD>
<LD>   A clue to what the animals think comes from a lioness pacing at the
back of her cage.</LD>
<LD>   She strides past her tiny cub, which is crying weakly from a dark cell
and trying to wriggle through an iron gate. The keeper says he can let
the cub join her mother to suckle only twice a day, because he has no
chicken wire to stop the cub from squeezing between the cage's bars. But,
a short walk away, chicken wire lines the cage of two pumas.</LD>
<TE>   Egypt's principal zoo encapsulates the situation of zoos across the
developing world. Built in an age when wild animals were objects of
entertainment, these zoos now lack the money to modernize and train
staff.</TE>
<TE>   In some places, such as Kabul in Afghanistan, or Kinshasa in the
Congo, years of war and government neglect have made matters worse for
zoo animals. At Giza, "it's a lack of vision," said Richard Hoath, a
Cairo-based nature writer and fellow of the London Zoological Society.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo's director, Moustafa Awad, rejects the charge, saying the zoo
is "No. 1 in the world."</TE>
<TE>   A former civil servant in the Agriculture Ministry, Awad has made
improvements since he took over the zoo in 1996. The lions now have an
open area--a paddock of grass and trees where one pride at a time can
take a break from the small cages.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo boasts 16 hippo, creatures that have long been hunted out of
the nearby Nile, and it has desert antelope such as addax and
scimitar-horned oryx that are almost extinct in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   But in an interview Awad appeared unaware of some problems.</TE>
<TE>   Awad said all the lions have access to water throughout the day. But
the lioness that recently gave birth was licking rainwater from a cavity
in the cage's cracked concrete floor because there was no water in her
basin.</TE>
<TE>   The keeper said he would not give her water until she had eaten for
fear she might vomit. British veterinarian John Knight, who has studied
Giza Zoo, said there is no reason to deprive lions of water.</TE>
<TE>   Awad said the zoo's African elephant is free to roam its enclosure.
But two of the three times that a reporter visited, the elephant had one
leg chained to the railings. Keeper Abdel Moneim said he regularly
shackled the elephant because otherwise "he will not come out [of his
house] for the visitors."</TE>
<TE>   While Moneim spoke, the elephant's trunk fiddled with the shackle and
explored Moneim's uniform, looking for the slices of sweet potato he
keeps in his pocket. In exchange for a tip, Moneim gives the slices to
visitors to feed the elephant.</TE>
<TE>   The two Indian elephants are invariably shackled, spending the whole
day anchored to the same spot. "This is inhuman," said Hoath, but Awad
said the pair must be tethered to protect visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, the adult oryx and Barbary sheep walk like big-footed
circus clowns, their overgrown hooves curling up. Awad said the zoo is
short of the anesthesia needed to sedate the animals while their hooves
are trimmed.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the problems he sees in the treatment of animals, Hoath
accused the zoo of failing in its primary purpose: to educate. Enclosure
signs don't tell visitors about the animals, and many enclosures have no
signs at all.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo used to have a high reputation. "Giza Zoo was a leader in the
development of innovative enclosure design," says the Encyclopedia of the
World's Zoos of the period 1891-1924. Then, the first director, Stanley
Flower of Britain, used imaginative landscaping and sunken fences to turn
the former royal gardens into paddocks for antelope and zebra.</TE>
<TE>   "It was at one point a very good zoo," agreed Knight, "but it has not
kept up with the way zoos tend to manage their animals."</TE>
<TE>   A regular sight is the teasing of the gibbon, a small white ape.
Children clap and chant in front of his cage until he emits a
high-pitched cry.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to enjoy ourselves," said Nabil Afif, 15. "The keeper
said, 'If you want to hear him scream, shout at him.' "</TE>
<TE>   Another keeper was spotted tapping a lion's paw with his finger to
make him growl before a couple with a child. A crumpled bank note
exchanged hands.</TE>
<TE>   People tease zoo animals all over the world, Awad said. "It's not a
scandal."</TE>
<TE>   "I find it shocking," Virginia McKenna, the British star of the film
"Born Free" who became an animal campaigner, said in a phone interview
from her home in Dorking, England.</TE>
<TE>   The Born Free Foundation received so many letters about the zoo's
conditions that in 1997 McKenna came to meet Awad. This led to the
foundation and another London-based group, the International Fund for
Animal Welfare, paying for a review of the zoo's operation in conjunction
with the Agriculture Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   The review compiled by Knight and a zoo architect recommended that
Giza reduce its population--now at 6,000 animals and birds--to provide
better care for fewer creatures, and that it phase out cages and build
larger enclosures.</TE>
<TE>   Awad rejected the report. He refused to discuss its recommendations,
saying only they were not new. "We don't need foreigners to teach us how
to handle our zoos," he added.</TE>

<HD>Venezuela's Strongman President Resigns, Placed Under Arrest</HD>
<DH>S. America: Military arrests Chavez and names businessman as
interim president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>Hugo Chavez resigned as president and was placed under arrest by
his former military allies Friday, after his charismatic reign as
Venezuela's nationalist strongman came crashing down in a flurry of
protest and violence.</LD>
<LD>   The military and its civilian allies named a 35-member "government of
democratic transition" to run the country, headed by a prominent
businessman and top Chavez critic. Pedro Carmona, the leader of
Venezuela's largest business association, became interim president.</LD>
<LD>   Carmona promised to hold elections within a year to choose a new
president for this oil-rich but economically troubled South American
nation. The new ruling council announced a major overhaul of Venezuela's
government, including the immediate firing of all members of the
pro-Chavez National Assembly and Supreme Court.</LD>
<TE>   "We must go about returning to the rule of law," Carmona, 60, told
supporters after taking the oath of office at the presidential palace.
"Strongman rule will be left behind. I will act in the most open manner,
working with all sectors of the country."</TE>
<TE>   The measures amounted to a counterrevolution, led primarily by the
nation's business sector, to the highly personalized state that Chavez
built in the three years since becoming president. The former paratrooper
allied Venezuela with Fidel Castro's Cuba, espoused a fiery populist
rhetoric and encouraged the growth of a cult of personality.</TE>
<TE>   In a major shift in foreign policy, Carmona's government also said the
state-owned oil company would discontinue Chavez's controversial oil
sales to the Communist regime in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Felipe Perez Roque said that his
country still recognized Chavez as president and that the overthrow was
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's supporters at home and abroad called the events in Venezuela
a coup. Chavez, who led a failed coup 10 years ago as a lieutenant
colonel, has not spoken in public since his last, defiant speech to the
Venezuelan people Thursday afternoon, in which he said he would not step
down.</TE>
<TE>   In Caracas, the capital, Atty. Gen. Isaias Rodriguez said he had not
seen evidence that Chavez had resigned.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't they allow him to be interviewed?" Rodriguez asked. "Did he
commit a crime? Is resigning a crime?"</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez called the Carmona government "unconstitutional." A few
hours later, Carmona announced that Rodriguez had been relieved of his
duties.</TE>
<TE>   Even the name of the country was changed Friday. Chavez fancied
himself the true heir to the mantle of Simon Bolivar, the 19th century
independence leader, and had renamed the country the Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela. The new government announced, to loud cheers from its
supporters in the palace, that the nation would once again be called,
simply, the Republic of Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer declared the
Bush administration's support for new elections in Venezuela and
condemned the actions of Chavez's government against protesters that left
at least 14 people dead and more than 200 wounded Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "According to the best information we have, the government suppressed
what was a peaceful demonstration of the people," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Several Latin American leaders, however, were critical of the new
government. In Costa Rica, leaders at the summit of the 19-nation Rio
Group of Latin American countries criticized "the interruption of
constitutional order" in Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican President Vicente Fox said his country would not recognize
Carmona's government until new elections were held, although he said it
wouldn't sever diplomatic relations.</TE>
<TE>   The streets of Caracas were calm Friday, a day after tens of thousands
of people marched on the presidential palace to demand Chavez's
resignation. Some witnesses said snipers positioned on rooftops had fired
on the anti-Chavez protesters.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez could face charges in the protesters' deaths. Still, he
retained the support of an untold number of Venezuelans, especially among
the poor. On Friday evening, the mood remained tense.</TE>
<TE>   "How can it be that our president, the man we chose to lead us, is
rotting in a jail cell?" said one of dozens of pro-Chavez callers to
Faith and Happiness, a religious radio station.</TE>
<TE>   "We repudiate, we hate what has happened," another caller said. "A
group of military men has stabbed our president in the back."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez is a cult hero to many impoverished Venezuelans, even though in
the final months of his presidency he implemented tough economic policies
demanded by the International Monetary Fund and sharply reduced
government spending.</TE>
<TE>   There were reports of violent protests Friday evening in some poor
neighborhoods of the capital.</TE>
<TE>   In a ceremony before Carmona was officially sworn into office, the
members of the new government took pains to give his administration a
veneer of legitimacy, scheduling legislative elections for December.</TE>
<TE>   The new leaders cited a long list of crimes committed by Chavez's
regime, including "an illegal concentration and usurpation of powers,"
the suppression of free speech and a foreign policy of "isolation" that
harmed the Venezuelan economy.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the military turned against Chavez on Thursday after the
bloodshed near the presidential palace and after Chavez moved to shut
down all the nation's private television stations.</TE>
<TE>   After being taken from the palace before dawn Friday, Chavez was being
held in an army base.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not being held in any cell," army Gen. Rommel Fuenmayor said.
"He is in a secure place being guarded by people of extreme confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Fuenmayor added that, in the final hours of his rule, while
negotiating his resignation with military officers, Chavez asked to be
allowed to leave Venezuela and flee to Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Several of Chavez's political allies and high-ranking members of his
government were arrested Friday, including Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, both
interior and justice minister.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was detained by police in the city of Baruta.</TE>
<TE>   "He surrendered without any resistance," Henrique Capriles, the mayor
of Baruta, told a local radio station. "He knew there was nothing he
could do."</TE>
<TE>   A pro-Chavez provincial governor, Ronald Blanco of Tachira, was
detained after refusing to recognize Carmona as president. Two generals
took him into custody at the provincial government offices and brought
him by plane to the same military facility where Chavez was being held.</TE>

<HD>Slaying of Reformer Attorney May Help Achieve Her Goal</HD>
<DH>Corruption: Investigation into Mexican city councilwoman's slaying
may lead to a cleanup of local government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATIZAPAN, Mexico
</DL>
<LD>When she joined the city council in August 2000, Maria de los
Angeles Tames already suspected that her hometown was corrupt. But her
parents and prosecutors say she had no idea the corruption was so
pervasive--or that it would one day kill her.</LD>
<LD>   The 27-year-old attorney, the politically mature daughter of a former
federal senator from the National Action Party, didn't plan to be a
crusader in this Mexico City suburb, her parents said. She just wanted to
make a difference.</LD>
<LD>   But Tames uncovered indications of corruption in the city government
and police beyond anything she imagined. And the evidence led her to
suspect Mayor Juan Antonio Dominguez.</LD>
<TE>   She found evidence that bidding for city contracts was rigged, that
building permits were sold illicitly, and that bars were paying police up
to $40,000 a year to ignore underage drinking, drug dealing and
prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   City administrators and police ignored the council's votes, including
one to halt construction of a beer warehouse in a residential zone.</TE>
<TE>   "She was more outraged than surprised when she learned of the
corruption," says her father, Pedro Tames, a former city administrator
who is now an executive at the Notimex news agency.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than look the other way, Tames became what other council
members described as the "reformist leader" on the council, while
gathering evidence that she told her family she would one day present to
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   She never made it. On Sept. 5, 2001, about a week before she planned
to resign and go to prosecutors, she was shot five times with a
high-caliber weapon on the doorstep of her home. Investigators say the
evidence she collected led them to her suspected killers. It could end up
achieving her main goal: cleaning up city hall.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Dominguez and his former personal secretary, Daniel
Garcia, were charged with murder, extortion and fraud. They are in jail
awaiting trial. Four other suspects are under house arrest. Another five
remain at large, including four other members of the Garcia family, which
prosecutors describe as a city hall "mafia," and the alleged triggerman.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say their seven-month investigation confirms Tames'
suspicions. While no one has been convicted, the investigation also
suggests how elected officials can bleed a city dry, and why it's no
accident that urban development in Mexico is so helter-skelter.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the arrests, many close to the case fear the violence isn't
over. Two other city council members, Virginia Ruiz and Claudia
Gutierrez, the city's human rights coordinator and prosecutors working on
the case all have been threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Tames had been active in politics since she was a teenager. After
going to law school, she told her parents that someday she wanted to be
elected to the federal chamber of deputies. Tames' interest in politics
was heightened by serving as an aide to her mother, Evangelina Perez
Zaragoza, during her year in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Tames' mother said in an interview Thursday that her daughter started
seeing trouble signs three months after joining the city council.</TE>
<TE>   The first indication was the city's direct purchase of $220,000 in
heavy machinery, which should have been put out for bid. Investigators
say the seller was a construction company that helped the mayor pay off
his mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   That led Tames to dig deeper into the city's contracting practices.
Investigators who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears for
their safety said that the winning bidders were usually cronies or
relatives of Dominguez or Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   She tried calling up or visiting the businesses that were listed as
losing bidders on city contracts, often finding that they didn't exist or
that the addresses were those of billiard parlors or private residences.
Some construction projects had special permits that had been approved by
Garcia and were not to be blocked, the investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Then, there were the many mysterious nighttime flights at the Atizapan
municipal airport that investigators think may have been used to
transport drugs. The airport's flight records have disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Tames and other council members got Garcia fired in January 2001. But
her insistence that other Garcia family members in city hall also be
fired fell on deaf ears. Meanwhile, Garcia became a bitter enemy.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, her father said she began to sense her conversations
were being recorded because the mayor repeated specific words and phrases
back to her in conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, investigators found a wiretap operation in a
building a few yards from city hall.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter told me she knew it was going on when the day after a
telephone conversation in which another city councilwoman called the
mayor's wife a taruga, or fool, the mayor called her to say that one
thing he wouldn't tolerate was disrespect toward his wife," said Pedro
Tames.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks before she was killed, Tames met the mayor at a restaurant
in an adjacent Mexico City suburb, and the mayor asked her to stop
criticizing him in council meetings. According to her father, she told
him she would stop as soon as he gave her reason to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Although she never felt her life was in danger, she had decided to
quit the council and go to prosecutors with the evidence she had.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted to put these people in jail," Pedro Tames said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after 8 p.m. on Sept. 5, as she was opening the gate to her
parents' home, the councilwoman was shot five times by a gunman who
prosecutors charged Thursday was hired by Daniel Garcia's brother,
Isaias. Four of those shots were in the back, all from a distance of
three feet or less. Her body was found by her mother.</TE>

father from the household.</DH>

<AU>JACK SULLIVAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>GRAND FORKS AIR FORCE BASE, N.D.
</DL>
<LD>It was the middle of his overnight shift when Staff Sgt. Robert
Warner came home, woke his wife and told her the Air Force was sending
him to the Persian Gulf. In an hour.</LD>
<LD>   April Warner remembers every minute of the next 60: Her husband paced
their government-issue house, more nervous than she had ever seen. They
double-checked the deployment bag he had packed 11 days before, on Sept.
11.</LD>
<LD>   They went over the bills Robert had always handled and signed papers
giving April power over their affairs. They decided not to wake their
four children. And then they said goodbye.</LD>
<TE>   "He kept saying, 'I love you, I love you,' " April recalls. "And I
kept thinking, 'Is this the last time I'm going to hear him say that?' "</TE>
<TE>   And then he was gone--joining the first wave of airmen sent from Grand
Forks to "Base X," the secret desert outpost 7,000 miles away that's home
for KC-135 Stratotankers to fly air-refueling missions in support of the
Afghan war.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, for the first time in her 11-year marriage--and her adult
life--April was suddenly alone.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, she tried to explain to the kids.</TE>
<TE>   "Did Daddy die?" 2-year-old Brittney asked.</TE>
<TE>   April started crying.</TE>
<TE>   "Daddy will be home, don't you worry," she said. "Daddy will be home
sooner than you think."</TE>
<TE>   But at 29, with four children and far from her extended family, she
was afraid at first that she wouldn't make it on her own. The Warners had
only lived in North Dakota a few months, after previous Air Force
postings in England and Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend ground away. April prayed at Mass on Sunday at the base's
Sunflower Chapel. She went to the base family support center Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Please help me," she said. "I don't know what to do. My husband left,
and it's our first winter here, and I don't even own a snow shovel."</TE>
<TE>Base Location Secret</TE>
<TE>   Robert Warner's first shift stretched for 40 hours as crews rushed to
reopen Base X.</TE>
<TE>   Contained within a larger military installation of its host country,
Base X had been used occasionally by Americans in the 1990s. The Air
Force keeps the base's location secret for security reasons and because
its host nation wants to limit knowledge of the help it is giving the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Gray-green scrub dots the vacant desert between the base's runways and
"Tent City," where the Americans live. Concrete barriers and concertina
wire ring the compound, and sandbagged guard posts rise above its fence.
Gravel streets line row after row of tan tents. Dust as fine as baby
powder quickly covers vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The first crews found little more than half a dozen empty buildings on
the rocky ground. Workers used two-foot-long bits to drill holes in the
rock for support poles for 253 tents. The civil engineers who plotted the
streets named them after the streets of New York--Park Avenue runs down
the center of the camp, and Wall Street passes before the finance tent.</TE>
<TE>   Standing near the center of Tent City is a mileage post marking the
distance to several cities and landmarks, including the World Trade
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, some amenities came: a barber, tailor, sand volleyball
court and outdoor movie screen.</TE>
<TE>   The fuel building where Robert Warner was assigned looks out over a
taxiway, runway and desert. From midnight to noon, six days a week, he
drove one of 15 fuel trucks that pumped a quarter-million gallons per day
into 10 KC-135s.</TE>
<TE>   He and his co-workers strung 120 water-bottle caps on a cord hung
below camouflage netting outside the building. Counting their duty as
with an abacus, they slid a cap from one side to the other every day,
another mark toward the trip home.</TE>
<TE>   But when it became obvious that four months would pass and they would
still be in the desert, they took the cord down.</TE>
<TE>Financial Advice</TE>
<TE>   April Warner returned from the family service center with an armful of
brochures, information most families receive to prepare well before
someone deploys. Postcards for her kids to send Robert. Advice on
finances. How to shoulder stress.</TE>
<TE>   Robert took care of the checkbook and many household decisions. "I
just had to step up to the plate and do it all," April said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert was the disciplinarian, a role she had a hard time filling. "My
kids would laugh at me and say, 'You're joking, Mom. Daddy's the one who
sends us to our room, not you,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   Time passed. She remembers an afternoon nap--made possible by a base
"Give parents a break" event where she had delivered her four
children--as if it were a vacation.</TE>
<TE>   The children had their own struggles. Ashleigh, 10, and Tommy, 9,
slept in Robert's T-shirts every night. "They smell just like Dad," they
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ashleigh took five of her father's fishing trophies into her room and
put them on her dresser.</TE>
<TE>   Things changed slowly. April grew as a default single parent, managing
her house and her children alone. She made a point of rewarding Tommy's
first entry in a Cub Scouts Pinewood Derby because he built his
third-place wooden racer himself.</TE>
<TE>   After a while, she contemplated the changes in her life.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm basically independent now," she said. Thinking ahead to Robert's
return, she added, "I'm going to have to make my husband feel like he's
not just occupying space."</TE>
<TE>   April and Robert grew up in towns near Syracuse, N.Y. They went to the
same high school. He proposed at a favorite fishing spot.</TE>
<TE>   A car wreck on the way to church convinced April that "yes" had been
the right answer: Thrown from the car, April broke every rib but one,
suffered a collapsed lung, fractured her pelvis and was unconscious for a
week. Robert never left her side.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew right then and there that he was going to be a great father
and husband," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Robert enlisted in the Air Force in 1993, three years after they
married, deciding it offered a better chance to provide for his family
than his job managing a pizza joint in Oswego, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   He was first sent to England, where 5-year-old Courtney was born, and
then to Oklahoma. Then they moved to the Grand Forks Air Force Base in
the flat, wind-swept Red River Valley, settling in last June.</TE>
<TE>   "I never expected anything like this," April says. "I never expected
that he would enter the service, and I never expected that he would be
away from us."</TE>
<TE>Hope Buried</TE>
<TE>   As Robert's thoughts turned to going home, he eventually saw that hope
was something best buried under routine.</TE>
<TE>   Work, eat, exercise, sleep, repeat. That's life at Base X. Laundry on
his day off, when he would also "grab whatever bit of sand I could, just
to be alone."</TE>
<TE>   His father sent a picture of Courtney at age 3. Robert told April he
almost cried when he saw it. Knowing her stoic husband, she cried.</TE>
<TE>   He and April e-mailed daily, and he talked about once a week with his
children. He worried, sometimes about what might happen to him, but more
often about something happening to his family while he was gone.</TE>
<TE>   After Ashleigh told him 'N Sync was coming to Grand Forks in late
March, he bought two $100 tickets over the Internet from the base. It was
the only thing she asked for while he was gone.</TE>
<TE>   The Warners' 11th anniversary passed, and two birthdays, Thanksgiving
and Christmas, which was marked at the base with a tree made of 2-by-4s
and mosquito netting.</TE>
<TE>   Robert, 32, said he rarely prayed before Base X. There, "I used to
pray every night: 'Get me home--safe.' "</TE>
<TE>   Robert was at Base X when it held a service for Marines who died in a
January KC-130 crash in southwestern Pakistan. Seven helmets rested on
M-16s bayoneted into sandbags, memorializing the soldiers who had lived
in the base's 1,100-person tent city before being deployed closer to the
fight.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst part about it is thinking about the people who aren't
coming back," Robert said. "I'm lucky."</TE>
<TE>   He knows many soldiers face harsher and more dangerous conditions than
he found at his base, but he learned a simple lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes you realize how much you have at home when you really don't
have anything where you're at," he said.</TE>
<TE>Almost Back Home</TE>
<TE>   After five long months, he is back home--almost.</TE>
<TE>   "Daddy, get over here! Now!" Brittney Warner calls out from behind a
chain-link gate inside a supply warehouse at the Grand Forks base, still
50 feet from her father, who stands in a crowd of 38 airmen and pilots
shuffling up to a Customs checkpoint. It's two hours since his jet
touched down.</TE>
<TE>   "Daddy's the next one coming!" says Courtney, turning from the gate to
dance an excited circle.</TE>
<TE>   Another long minute as he clears paperwork, and then he's through.</TE>
<TE>   He is quickly covered in children. His face folds into a smile and he
does not cry.</TE>
<TE>   He tells his daughters they are beautiful and his son he is handsome.</TE>
<TE>   "Will you give me a kiss?" he asks Brittney, taking her from his wife
and into his arms. Then he leans forward to kiss his wife, whose red eyes
fill with tears.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, Robert and April sit on a couch in their living
room. A floral rug covers the linoleum floor before them and a sign hangs
in the hall above the doorway: "Life is fragile. Handle with prayer."</TE>
<TE>   Robert says his daughters are prettier than when he left, and he plans
to take Tommy to fish through the ice of Lake Ashtabula.</TE>
<TE>   April says her faith strengthened her as she prayed for her husband's
safety, and she smiles broadly when Robert agrees.</TE>
<TE>   Brittney climbs between them, raises her hand for a high-five and
teases her mother, "Up high! Down low! Too slow!"</TE>
<TE>   "She never was talking like this when I left," Robert says, laughing
at the toddler's chatter and the way he's stepped back into the life he
left so suddenly.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything here keeps going on, but you stop," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Robert may be sent back, but likely not for months. The Warners say
they could handle deployment again, knowing they survived his first.</TE>

<HD>Age Discrimination Hits Close to Home for Baby Boomers</HD>
<DH>Jobs: Employment bias is the fastest-growing category of
complaints, the EEOC says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EILEEN ALT POWELL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Ron Heater was laid off about two years ago. Despite mailing and
hand delivering "hundreds and hundreds of resumes," he says, he still
hasn't landed a new job.</LD>
<LD>   Heater believes his age--he's 49--might be part of the problem.</LD>
<LD>   "Most of the time, companies don't even acknowledge my resume was
received, or the interviewers are cold and unreceptive," said Heater, a
specialist in credit card fraud detection. "I really believe they're
looking for the 20- to 25-year-olds who can hold down the fort for quite
a bit less money."</LD>
<TE>   Age discrimination in both hiring and firing appears to be a growing
problem for baby boomers, most of whom are now in their 40s and 50s,
despite the protections of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act that
dates to 1967.</TE>
<TE>   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces the law,
said age discrimination is the fastest-growing category of complaints it
receives, with 17,405 filings last year. Complaints about discrimination
involving disabilities grew at the second-fastest rate.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie McCann, an attorney specializing in age discrimination at the
AARP in Washington, said complaints often rise when the economy is weak,
as it has been for the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies that need to cut back may target older workers because they
believe they'll get more savings because older workers earn more," she
said. "They don't take into account what they lose in institutional
memory and skills."</TE>
<TE>   She added that "baby boomers are the type of people more likely to
stand up and challenge if they're wronged."</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, the AARP helped win an agreement from Ford Motor Co.
to revise a management evaluation system that older, white workers
alleged was unfairly singling them out for demotion or firing. Ford
agreed to pay $10.5 million to settle two class-action suits, although it
denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Allstate Insurance, meanwhile, is fighting a suit brought by the EEOC
that accuses the Northbrook, Ill., company of illegally converting
thousands of agents to private contractors, eliminating such benefits as
health insurance and office allowances. The AARP is co-counsel in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Guerin, an employment specialist at legal publisher Nolo in
Berkeley, says workers who believe they're being unfairly treated should
keep careful records that can be the basis of a complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen for comments by the people who make decisions to lay workers
off, like, 'We're looking for a more energetic group of employees,' " she
said. "Compare the stated reasons for layoffs with who actually got laid
off. Keep track of dates, places, witnesses."</TE>
<TE>   Guerin pointed out that there are fewer cases involving hiring because
evidence often is hard to come by.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're looking for a job, you don't know the other people the
company had to choose from," she said. "Unless someone makes a blatantly
biased comment during an interview or a company runs an ad with something
like 'looking for young, dynamic workers,' it's very hard to prove a
case."</TE>
<TE>   Still, baby boomers are going to court with hiring cases.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 screenwriters have filed suit against 23 television
networks, studios and talent agencies, alleging that they're not getting
jobs because of their age.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a perceived notion in the industry that writers who are
older can't write for younger audiences," said lead attorney Paul
Sprenger of Washington, D.C. "That's wrong, and we want to prevent that
going forward."</TE>
<TE>   Among the plaintiffs is Mollie Levy, 49, a New York comedy writer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm irate," Levy said. "This has been going on for a very long time.
. . . You see quotes in publications all the time, like, 'How can a
54-year-old writer write for Jennifer Aniston?' By that reasoning, how
could an adult have written 'Little House on the Prairie?' "</TE>
<TE>   Rather than going to court, some baby boomers are forming support
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Heater has joined one such group, 40 Plus of Greater Washington, which
runs training classes to help older professional workers better prepare
and market themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Gilbert, a retired military logistics and transportation expert
who heads 40 Plus, believes his group can help older job seekers put
their problems in perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "You can get righteously indignant, which doesn't seem to help much,"
he said. "You can get confrontational, which seems to help even less. You
can get depressed and allow yourself to become isolated. Or you can plug
on and find a place where your maturity and skills are appreciated for
what they are."</TE>
<TE>   40 Plus urges members to write resumes that emphasize their
accomplishments and skills and de-emphasize their ages.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want an employer to see the year you graduated from college
at the top," Gilbert said. "You might even leave that out--and leave out
the jobs and the dates of the jobs that were a long time ago."</TE>

<HD>Who Could Have Foretold a Bad Psychic Experience?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY SCHWARTZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The operator was very chipper when I called.</LD>
<LD>   "Have an amazing experience!" she chirped, as she sent me on my way to
the psychic reading that Miss Cleo guaranteed would change my life.</LD>
<LD>   Lauren was my psychic. Lauren was not a real live-wire, but then, I
didn't give her a lot to work with: No, I was not thinking of starting my
own business. No, I don't think anyone from my past is trying to reach
me. No, I haven't suffered from arthritis.</LD>
<TE>   I told her I was pretty happy with my financial status; she saw more
money in my future. Maybe from a lottery. Did I ever play numbers?</TE>
<TE>   "Nooooo."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't usually tell people to play numbers or give numbers out but I
see some numbers here for you if you'd like to give them a try. . . . OK:
5, 8, 17, 33, 35, 40."</TE>
<TE>   (Over the next six days, I checked the lotteries. Not even close.)</TE>
<TE>   Lauren asked me how long I had been with the person in my life.
Twenty-two years, I said. "Wow," said the psychic. "Yes, I definitely
believe this person is your soulmate."</TE>
<TE>   She told me I was going to live a long life, "probably into your 80s
or 90s, actually." She told me that my children are going to be
successful, and that the youngest would be the most successful (Way to
go, Benjamin!).</TE>
<TE>   The operator had told me that I would be getting five free minutes.
But the recorded preamble to my chat with Lauren said the first three
minutes were free, and ultimately I heard a tone--softer than the one I
had been told to expect--one minute and 50 seconds into the call.</TE>
<TE>   "Was that three minutes we just passed? I heard a beep," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know about the three minutes. . . . I see some legal action
in your life. Are you suing someone?" Lauren asked.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, I ended the conversation, as Lauren tried desperately to
keep it going ("Why don't I ask you what your favorite color is?") The
entire call lasted 7:04.</TE>
<TE>   On my next phone bill, I was charged $29.94--for a nine-minute call.</TE>

<HD>Bird Ailment Study May Yield AIDS Clues</HD>
<DH>Science: The malady, which swept through East Coast finch
populations, is being monitored by the National Institutes of Health.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ESCH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ITHACA, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>During an unusually icy January in the Maryland suburbs, red
finches started showing up with grotesquely swollen, crusty eyes.</LD>
<LD>   The eastern house finch is normally a scrappy, social species. But in
those early weeks of 1994, infected finches struggled to find sunflower
seeds with fading sight. They sat alone on the bird feeders, feathers
ruffled, while healthy birds flitted away to roost in nearby trees.</LD>
<LD>   Within weeks, sick finches were reported far beyond the Washington
area where they were first observed. By the end of the year, they had
been spotted all over the Eastern Seaboard.</LD>
<TE>   Now, scientists hope to use what they are learning about the finch eye
disease to expand understanding of a growing number of epidemic diseases
in humans, animals and plants.</TE>
<TE>   The project is funded by a five-year grant from the National
Institutes of Health, one of 12 chosen by the NIH and other federal
agencies to investigate the ecology of infectious disease. The studies
will examine how environmental changes such as habitat destruction,
global warming and pollution may cause new diseases to emerge and old
ones to become more deadly.</TE>
<TE>   "An unusually large number of new diseases have emerged in the last 20
years or so, not only in humans, but in animals and plants as well," said
ecologist Andre Dhondt of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology in
Ithaca.</TE>
<TE>   He cited AIDS, Ebola, drug-resistant tuberculosis, mad cow disease and
other spreading plagues.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably the first study ever where it has been possible to
study in great detail a newly emerging disease in a natural population,"
Dhondt said.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the finches, scientists at the University of Georgia
and North Carolina State found the birds were infected with a new strain
of Mycoplasma gallisepticum--or MG--a bacterium that is a common cause of
upper respiratory infections in chickens. It had never been seen in
songbirds.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is not to know about house finches and Mycoplasma," Dhondt
said. "The goal is to develop a mathematical model that allows us to
identify what we need to measure and summarize what we've found."</TE>
<TE>   The model can then be applied to other diseases.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the interesting things about Mycoplasma in house finches is
that it has many similarities to AIDS," Dhondt said. "Understanding how
we can fight this disease in finches might help us understand how to
treat similar epidemics in humans."</TE>
<TE>   Bird watchers and ornithologists were alarmed at how swiftly the
disease was spreading. They feared migrating finches would infect
songbirds in the tropics.</TE>
<TE>   At Cornell, Dhondt's research team enlisted the help of Project
FeederWatch, a nationwide army of backyard bird watchers.</TE>
<TE>   The collaboration of professional researchers and more than 8,000
"citizen scientists" found the infection reduced the eastern house finch
population by 60%--180 million birds--within 2 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   There are many unanswered questions. Why is the disease wiping out
house finches, but not sparrows or cardinals? Why has it persisted? Why
haven't finch populations recovered? Why are house finches in the eastern
United States severely affected, while western populations are, so far,
virtually untouched?</TE>
<TE>   At a Cornell University field lab in Ithaca, Elliot Swarthout captures
finches in a feeder trap to collect data. He weighs them, swabs their
eyes to test for disease, takes blood samples, attaches leg bands and
releases them. He outfits some of the birds with tiny radio transmitters
to monitor their travels.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the lab, a graduate student observes small flocks of wild
finches housed temporarily in a room, recording their behavior to see if
social dominance affects disease resistance.</TE>
<TE>   In researcher George Kollias' lab at Cornell's veterinary school,
house finches are intentionally infected with Mycoplasma then kept in
cages where they are fed and protected from the elements and other
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to see if birds would recover from the blinding infection
if they weren't killed by starvation or predators first.</TE>
<TE>   Several factors appear to make eastern house finches more vulnerable
to the epidemic, Dhondt said. One is inbreeding.</TE>
<TE>   House finches are native in the West and were trapped and sold as
"Hollywood Finches" in the East in the 1930s, until federal law
prohibited sale of American songbirds. The eastern population is
descended from a small number of captive birds released in 1940 in New
York City.</TE>
<TE>   Another contributor is the eastern house finch's behavior. Western
house finches are desert birds, but in the East, the brown-streaked
females and rosy males are primarily suburban birds that congregate at
feeders.</TE>
<TE>   Eastern house finches also are highly mobile, spreading infection
rapidly over a wide area.</TE>
<TE>   "Will it move to the West? We don't know," Dhondt said. "Our model
should help us predict that."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers in Ithaca, Atlanta and at Princeton University also are
exploring the extent to which stress makes the birds more susceptible,
Dhondt said.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we're speculating about is why we find a peak of
disease in February," Dhondt said. One theory is that as they prepare for
springtime mating, the birds are physically stressed.</TE>
<TE>   Dhondt said he expects the studies will produce a more detailed
understanding of the disease in two to three years.</TE>
<TE>   "What's so interesting about this system of Mycoplasma in house
finches is the degree to which we will be able to understand the strange
dynamics of host and disease," Dhondt said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you study one particular thing in phenomenal detail, you always
hope what you learn will apply to other systems and help you build
theory," he said. "That's really why we do research: to understand the
world around us."</TE>

<HD>Germs Under Pressure From Science</HD>
<DH>Food: New processing techniques promise safer products without
sacrificing flavor or shelf life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PEGGY ANDERSEN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>KENT, Wash.
</DL>
<LD>Every kid knows what it means to be squished like a bug.</LD>
<LD>   These days, scientists are using water under very high
pressure--starting at about 37,000 pounds per square inch--to squish bugs
we can't even see, the ones that cause food to spoil or cause illness.</LD>
<LD>   The goal is to make food safe without cooking all the flavor and
nutrition out of it.</LD>
<TE>   High-pressure processing is just one of the new technologies emerging
to tackle this challenge. Irradiation, being used in moderate doses for
raw meat products now sold in the Midwest, may be the best known.</TE>
<TE>   But the process being pioneered here by Fresher Under Pressure may do
the least damage to food. The company is a fledgling subsidiary of Flow
International, a Nasdaq-traded industry leader whose ultra high-pressure
water jets are used to cut everything from disposable diapers and Fig
Newtons to 12-inch-thick titanium.</TE>
<TE>   Flow's sleek stainless-steel processors use ultra high pressure to
squeeze the germs--but not the color, flavor, texture or nutrients--out
of guacamole, salsa, avocado slices, deli meats, juice and raw oysters.</TE>
<TE>   The process even shucks the oysters as it extends the time these
refrigerated foods will keep. Foods are simply placed inside the
device--liquids are pumped through--and pressure applied, for a few
minutes at most.</TE>
<TE>   Products must contain moisture for the process to work. Food is not
crushed because the pressure is uniformly applied--as marine life is not
crushed at the bottom of the ocean, where pressure is about 15,000 pounds
per square inch.</TE>
<TE>   Air is kept to a minimum. A whole apple would collapse into its center
seed cavity, for example, but sliced apple would come out fine.</TE>
<TE>   The process has been proven effective "in killing bacteria such as E.
coli, Listeria," said researcher V.M. Bala at the National Center for
Food Safety and Technology near Chicago, where Flow and other corporate
partners work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and scientists
from Illinois Institute of Technology.</TE>
<TE>   And pressurized foods "are much closer to natural-looking,
fresh-looking," Bala noted. Treated orange juice and salsa "look and
taste like freshly prepared."</TE>
<TE>   The next step, and it may be just a few years away from supermarket
shelves, is "shelf-stable" food that will keep for months or years
without refrigeration.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers believe a combination of pressure and moderate heat--in
the 158-degree to 203-degree range--will do the trick.</TE>
<TE>   The Army, which is looking for an alternative to its Meals Ready to
Eat, or MREs, is supporting the research.</TE>
<TE>   These meals are expected to taste "just prepared" when they're heated
and served, said Edmund Ting, chief technology officer for Fresher Under
Pressure.</TE>
<TE>   High temperatures and irradiation can undermine flavor and nutrition.
Freezing and thawing also change foods, and leave some vegetables "kind
of limp, kind of tough and chewy. So hopefully this technology will get
us to the point it'll be a lot crisper, a lot more fresh-like," Ting
said.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't buy food because it's safe. They buy food because it
tastes better," says Pat Adams, Fresher Under Pressure's president and
CEO.</TE>
<TE>   When high-pressure treatment is used to preserve guacamole by Keller,
Texas-based Avomex, "it helps blend the whole product together," Adams
said. "You get a much higher-quality product."</TE>
<TE>   For oyster processors such as Nisbet Oyster Co. in Bay Center, Wash.,
and Motivatit in Houma, La., "the safety is almost a secondary benefit,"
Ting said. "They've been looking for a technology to shuck oysters
forever."</TE>
<TE>   In most cases--for most canned goods, for example--pressure treatment
will not replace pasteurization. Its best use at this stage is for
higher-value, heat-sensitive foods.</TE>
<TE>   "Not just vitamins, but folic acid, niacin--all of these nutritional
components are harmed by heat," Ting said. After orange juice is
conventionally heat-processed, "some of the vitamin C is put back. But
some of these things people don't put back in," because consumers are
unaware of them.</TE>
<TE>   Flow and the center are about midway through a three-year Army-backed
project to develop shelf-stable products--MREs of "higher quality and
higher nutrient content," said Patrick Dunne at the Natick Soldier Center
in Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   MREs now are prepared in giant pressure cookers, where they poach for
extended periods at about 250 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Right away you can see the potential for overcooking," Dunne
deadpanned.</TE>
<TE>   Army standards for shelf stable are above and beyond civilian ones, he
notes. MREs must be storable for up to three years at temperatures around
80 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Dunne anticipates a marketable shelf-stable product by mid-2005--two
years after the center's three-year project is completed.</TE>
<TE>   The key is eliminating the threat from bacterial spores, which are
much tougher than live bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why canning"--heat pasteurization--"is such a harsh process.
It's absolutely required to get rid of spores that cause botulism," said
Kathy Knutson, outreach manager at the Chicago-area research center.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>Pressure-Packed Procedures</TE>
<TE>   Solid foods being subjected to high pressure are sealed in a flexible
package and placed in a stainless-steel vessel filled with water. Liquids
are pumped through specially built systems and bottled later.</TE>
<TE>   The vessel is then filled with water and pressurized by a pump up to
87,000 pounds per square inch. By comparison, water pressure at the
deepest part of the ocean is about 15,000 pounds per square inch.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some examples of processing times and pressures:</TE>
<TE>   * Acidic juices are usually pressurized for 60 seconds at 80,000 psi
to reduce pathogens such as E. coli.</TE>
<TE>   * Oysters are usually pressurized at 37,000 to 42,000 psi for 40 to 70
seconds to shuck the oyster. Longer hold times--up to three minutes--are
used to reduce Vibrio bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   * Ready-to-eat meats are usually pressurized at 87,000 psi for up to
two minutes to reduce pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes.</TE>
<TE>   Fresher Under Pressure's smallest commercial unit is a 35-liter vessel
that can process about 450 pounds per hour. The primary commercial unit
is a 215-liter vessel that can process about 1,800 pounds per hour.</TE>
<TE>   The largest available unit is a 320-liter unit that can process about
2,400 pounds per hour. It costs about $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   High-pressure processing is also being researched for medicinal uses,
particularly with viruses.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>The Mahane Yehuda market on Jaffa Street is always crowded before
Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, and the mood there Friday afternoon was
unusually upbeat for an anxious city living with the drumbeat of war and
the danger of suicide bombers.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was in town, and however slim his
chances were of arranging a cease-fire, his mere presence gave the
Israelis' spirits a boost. The day was springlike--sunny and 75 degrees.
The battlefront news, from the Israeli perspective, was good, with the
military reporting that it was securing the Jenin refugee camp in the
West Bank after an eight-day battle.</LD>
<LD>   Ehud Olmert, the mayor of Jerusalem, stopped at the market's deli, as
he does most Fridays, to buy challah, a special Shabbat bread. Shimon
Iluz bumped into his brother, and they stopped to chat in a doorway near
the market. Eli Sheva, a Michigan-born resident of Jerusalem, looked at
the vegetables on one vendor's cart and thought about how much she
enjoyed Mahane Yehuda on Fridays and seeing Arabs and Israelis mix and
get along fine.</LD>
<TE>   A young woman from the Jenin camp was also on Jaffa Street on Friday,
but she wasn't there for pleasure. Tentatively identified as Nidal
Daraghmeh, she had explosives under her dress. She started to enter the
market but apparently was unnerved by the sight of security at each
entrance. So she turned and joined a queue of about 30 people awaiting
the No. 6 bus to the neighborhood of Talpiot.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, Awadallah Hussein, an Israeli Arab, came to a stop. As he
opened the door, Daraghmeh blew herself up. The explosion was so
powerful, car windows a block away were shattered. Six people died, in
addition to the bomber, and as many as 80 were wounded. It was, Israeli
authorities said, the 110th suicide attack against the Jewish state in
the last 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Jaffa Street, a main thoroughfare, was in panic. Shoppers
ran screaming for cover. A woman's head lay outside the deli. Arms and
legs were strewn about, resting on the sidewalk among potatoes and
melons. Broken glass and plastic shopping bags and shredded paper
littered the street. And once again, the wail of sirens filled the air,
as did calls for help.</TE>
<TE>   "I admit my first thought was, 'How do you bring Powell here--not so
he can see the dead, but so he can see those who survived?' " said
Olmert, the mayor, who had just crossed the street and gotten into his
car when the blast went off.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you bring him here so that he can see their fear and anxiety,
so that finally everyone may understand what cannot be seen from
thousands of kilometers away? For them, this is a political problem. But
for us, this is our life, and it gets harder from one attack to the next.
I no longer know what to say to the shocked residents of the city."</TE>
<TE>   "I had just greeted the mayor with 'Shabbat shalom,' " Iluz said.
"Then this huge blast shook everything. The body of the bomber--at least
I think it was hers--flew into the air and landed on my brother and I. It
was a miracle we survived."</TE>
<TE>   Sheva, the Israeli American, ran to help the walking wounded. Later,
still clutching a bloodied scarf, she said: "I believe the bomber belongs
right where she went--in hell. There was no peace process before, and
there isn't one now. There is war. I can't tell you how lovely this
market is, when people are getting murdered here."</TE>
<TE>   A senior aide to Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat,
Mohammed Dahlan, the security chief in the Gaza Strip, said he believed
that the bombing was in response to the Israeli military offensive in the
West Bank and not related to Powell's trip. He reiterated the Palestinian
Authority's stated position that attacks on civilians on either side is
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an offshoot of Arafat's mainstream Fatah
movement, claimed responsibility for the attack. The militia has been at
the forefront of planning and executing the suicide attacks that gave
rise to the Israeli offensive. The Israeli campaign hit hard at the Jenin
camp, viewing it as a nest of militants: The woman who blew herself up
Friday was just the latest of a long string of bombers from there.</TE>
<TE>   How much control Arafat exercises over the group is a point of debate,
but the Palestinian leader is eager to meet Powell, and it seemed
unlikely that he would approve an attack that has led to the delay, if
not the cancellation, of that meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The suicide attacks have brought fear and a sense of vulnerability
more intense thananything Israelis have felt for years.</TE>
<TE>   "Why doesn't the international community realize we are victims?" Odi
Steinberger, 23, said as he watched emergency workers don gloves and pick
up brown plastic bags used for the collection of body parts.</TE>

<HD>Interim Venezuelan President Resigns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>Supporters of deposed President Hugo Chavez stormed back into power
late Saturday, making the new interim president resign less than 48 hours
after strongman Chavez had been forced from office.</LD>
<LD>   The stunning turnabout followed a day of violence and confusion that
climaxed with key military leaders declaring their loyalty to Chavez.</LD>
<LD>   Pedro Carmona resigned as interim president hours after thousands of
Chavez supporters surrounded and took control of the Miraflores
presidential palace. The prominent businessman had taken power Friday in
the face of massive anti-Chavez demonstrations.</LD>
<TE>   Chavez's vice president--who just hours earlier had been in hiding,
fearing arrest--took the oath of office Saturday evening. Diosdado
Cabello said he would be a "temporary president" until Chavez returned.
Army Gen. Rafael Arrieta said Chavez, under arrest since late Thursday,
would soon return to Caracas, the capital, and reassume office, perhaps
as early as this morning. A Cabinet minister said Chavez was at an island
naval base.</TE>
<TE>   "The only president of Venezuela is Hugo Chavez," Jesus del Valle,
head of the army's honor guard, said on the government television
station, which was taken over late Saturday by Chavez supporters.</TE>
<TE>   It remained unclear early today whether the rest of the military would
back Chavez's return to power. Carmona's whereabouts were unknown.</TE>
<TE>   The upheaval, which claimed at least nine lives Saturday, pointed to
the deep rifts in Venezuelan society. The country is deeply divided
between rich and poor and by its love and hate for the charismatic
Chavez, a former paratrooper who first came to prominence during a failed
coup in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Caracas witnessed the latest chapter in a weeklong drama.
Gunshots rang out in the Catia slum, a Chavez bastion, as police tried
unsuccessfully to contain the protests. Many poor residents marched and
rode motorcycles toward the center of the capital city, angrily calling
for Chavez's reinstatement.</TE>
<TE>   Two days earlier, it had been thousands of mostly middle-class
Venezuelans who joined an anti-Chavez rally that ended in violence and
led to Chavez's ouster, three years into his term as the nation's
democratically elected president.</TE>
<TE>   "Here there are two Venezuelas," said Luis Alfonso Godoy, a retired
soldier who joined a pro-Chavez rally Saturday outside the Fuerte Tiuna
military base. "Chavez was the first president to speak for the poor. He
worked for us 24 hours a day."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez polarized the country with populist, anti-American rhetoric
even as he implemented budget-cutting measures demanded by the
International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Carmona, the leader of Venezuela's largest business
association, announced a counterrevolution that undid Chavez's control of
all three branches of government. The National Assembly was dissolved and
the Supreme Court dismissed--Chavez had filled both with his allies, in
part by holding frequent elections and referendums.</TE>
<TE>   With their patron in custody, several of Chavez's ministers went into
hiding. Others were arrested by Carmona's government, including Ramon
Rodriguez Chacin, who was both interior and justice minister.</TE>
<TE>   The actions drew criticism from several Latin American leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In Argentina, President Eduardo Duhalde said Saturday that Carmona's
decision to dismiss the National Assembly was "typical of a
dictatorship." Nicaragua, Paraguay and Panama also labeled the new
government illegitimate.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican President Vicente Fox had said that his country would not
recognize Carmona's interim government.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps buoyed by the international condemnations, key members of
Chavez's regime stepped up their actions against Carmona's government.</TE>
<TE>   Cabello said Saturday that Chavez's supporters had taken control of
the Miraflores palace.</TE>
<TE>   "I am the president in this moment," Cabello said in a telephone
interview with CNN's Spanish-language news program. "The president
[Chavez] is not in office. So I am in control." But, he added, "I can't
go out into the street because my life is in danger."</TE>
<TE>   Just after 10 p.m. Saturday, Cabello, dressed in a short-sleeved shirt
and jeans, took the oath as "temporary president" in the Miraflores
palace in a hastily arranged ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Military leaders also balked at charges here and abroad that their
arrest of Chavez and their support for the creation of a new government
had been, in effect, a coup.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the same generals who had taken to the airwaves early
Friday to announce that Chavez had resigned took to the airwaves again to
criticize the government that succeeded him.</TE>
<TE>   "We demand respect for the constitution," said Gen. Efrain Vasquez,
head of the army, as other generals stood impassively at his side. "Our
action [Friday] was not a coup. . . . We believe there should be
corrections in the process of transition to a new government."</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez said that the military would support Carmona only if he agreed
to bring back the National Assembly. About an hour later, Carmona said in
a telephone interview with CNN that he would comply with the demand.</TE>
<TE>   The interview was the president's only public statement of the day
before he resigned late Saturday in a call to a radio station.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, it had been unclear who was in control of Caracas, the
capital with 2 million people, and the rest of the country.</TE>
<TE>   A carnival atmosphere reigned outside the Miraflores palace, where
thousands of Chavez supporters had gathered, more than a few of them
drunk. Some soldiers inside the palace told reporters that they had
switched sides in the conflict and now supported Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Cheers rang out as several of Chavez's ministers approached the
palace, including Maria Cristina Iglesias, who was Chavez's minister of
labor. Earlier, several ministers from Carmona's government joined
reporters in a panicked flight from the palace through an emergency
tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   Pro-Chavez mobs surrounded at least two television stations that had
been highly critical of Chavez's rule, breaking windows. On Thursday,
Chavez had ordered the closure of those and other privately owned
television stations, saying they were fomenting a rebellion against his
rule.</TE>
<TE>   "We are showing these images so that the metropolitan police and the
National Guard come to our assistance," said an unidentified announcer on
RCTV as that station broadcast live a mob attack on its offices.</TE>
<TE>   "As the father of a family, as a Venezuelan," the announcer continued
in a pleading voice, "I want to say this kind of action will not do our
country any good."</TE>
<TE>   After a three-hour siege, Chavez supporters took over the
station--apparently without bloodshed--and used it and other stations to
broadcast their pronouncements.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-Chavez demonstrations began late Friday on the outskirts of
the city. Protesters erected barricades blocking several highways,
including the one leading to the international airport.</TE>
<TE>   A doctor at a Caracas morgue who asked not to be identified said
Saturday morning that at least 30 people had been killed in the previous
night's violence.</TE>
<TE>   A Caracas city official said at least nine people had been killed
Saturday, including a policeman.</TE>
<TE>   The bloodshed provided a vivid counterpoint to the repression of
Thursday's anti-Chavez march, in which at least 15 people were killed.
Most of the hundreds of thousands of people who joined that march
remained inside their homes Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Chavez was a madman. He set this country back 40 years," said Augusto
Garbari, 36, a psychiatrist who said he saw people near him shot while
marching in the anti-Chavez rally. "He took us to this high level of
irony and sarcasm, like something you see in the worst countries of
Africa."</TE>
<TE>   Military officials said that Chavez resigned early Friday morning. But
by late Saturday, a growing number of voices were questioning whether he
left office voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez had not spoken in public since Thursday, when he defiantly
promised to remain in power. His daughter, Marisabel Rodriguez, told a
Venezuelan television station Saturday that Chavez had not stepped down.</TE>
<TE>   "He did not resign, he did not sign the letter" the generals gave him,
she said. "He said he was ready to resign, but only in front of the
[National] Assembly, as required by the law."</TE>
<TE>   A minister in the Carmona government revealed Saturday that Chavez had
resigned only orally and said that he would be sent abroad once he
submitted his resignation in writing.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, Gen. Carlos Alfonso Martinez, head of the National
Guard, added his voice to those of other military leaders backing away
from Carmona's aggressive pursuit of Chavez's supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to recognize that President Hugo Chavez has support from
important sectors of the people," Martinez said, conspicuously referring
to Chavez as president in the present tense.</TE>

<HD>Russian Troops Pull Out of Georgia's Buffer Zone</HD>
<DH>Caucasus: Moscow says the 'peacekeeping' operation is over.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>A day after launching what it called a peacekeeping operation,
Russia retreated Saturday from a volatile buffer zone near the separatist
Georgian region of Abkhazia following sharp protests from Georgia and the
United Nations.</LD>
<LD>   Russian officials had said they moved into the upper Kodori Gorge on
Friday to reestablish a security checkpoint. But a day later, they said
their "patrolling" had been completed.</LD>
<LD>   Georgian officials had denounced the Russian operation as an invasion.
The United Nations observer mission in the region described it as
"aggressive" and "combative" and demanded an immediate withdrawal.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the U.N. mission confirmed Saturday evening that the
Russian withdrawal had concluded.</TE>
<TE>   The surge in tension occurs as U.S. military trainers are preparing to
arrive in Georgia to help arm and train the nation's army. The American
forces had been expected to arrive last month.</TE>
<TE>   To defuse the situation, Georgian President Eduard A. Shevardnadze and
Russian President Vladimir V. Putin spoke by telephone Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The incident "must not cause a radical exacerbation of relations with
Russia," Shevardnadze said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian commander, Maj. Gen. Alexander Yevteyev, insisted that the
operation in the Kodori Gorge, in the buffer zone near separatist
Abkhazia, had not violated a peacekeeping protocol signed by Russia and
Georgia on April 2, and he said similar patrols will follow.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian forces, nominally under the control of the group of
ex-Soviet republics known as the Commonwealth of Independent States,
"will continue to patrol the lower and the upper part of the Kodori Gorge
in compliance with the protocol no less than once a week," Yevteyev said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kodori Gorge is one of two major hot spots in Georgia, which has
seen clashes involving several separatist movements as well as spillover
violence from Russia's breakaway region of Chechnya, on its northern
border.</TE>
<TE>   Russian troops have been stationed as peacekeepers in Abkhazia since
1994. Georgian officials bristle at Moscow's presence and accuse the
Russians of siding with the rebels. However, Georgia's own armed forces
are in disarray and unable to control the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Russian commanders said Saturday that the peacekeepers had been fired
on during their brief deployment in the upper Kodori Gorge, and the
commanders blamed Georgia for failing to withdraw all its forces from the
region as required under the April 2 agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "According to the provision, Georgian troops should have been
withdrawn from the upper and the lower part of the Kodori Gorge by April
10 of this year," Yevteyev said. "The U.N. secretary-general's special
envoy to Georgia will be informed about the violations."</TE>
<TE>   Shevardnadze's envoy to the separatist region, Emzar Kvitsiani,
denounced the Russian accusation as "an invention."</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, Georgian units were obliged to depart from the
gorge last week to clear the way for U.N.-monitored peacekeeping patrols.
The U.N. observer mission said it had warned the Russians in advance that
the operation in the upper Kodori Gorge would violate the agreement.</TE>

<HD>Village Is China's Fledgling 'Davos'</HD>
<DH>Forum: Asia's version of the global economic conference, convened
by Beijing, points to regime's growing clout in region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOAO, China
</DL>
<LD>The world remembers Hainan island as the place where an American
spy plane made an emergency landing a year ago after colliding with a
Chinese fighter jet.</LD>
<LD>   But the Chinese don't intend for this tropical locale to be relegated
to a historical footnote.</LD>
<LD>   Boao, a deserted fishing village on the island's eastern side, is
being transformed into the Davos, Switzerland, of China.</LD>
<TE>   Davos, an elite skiing destination, has played host for more than
three decades to the annual meeting of movers and shakers known as the
World Economic Forum. Only the events of Sept. 11 led the forum to
convene this year in New York.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday and Saturday, however, China held an Asian version of the
forum here--an event marking the country's effort to counteract U.S.
dominance in international affairs. It also symbolized Beijing's rising
political and economic clout in the Asian Pacific region.</TE>
<TE>   With the world struggling amid a sluggish economy and the United
States barely out of recession, China is a 900-pound guerrilla that few
in Asia can afford to ignore. Despite inflated growth statistics, it
remains the only country in the region to survive the Asian financial
crisis of the late 1990s and the current global slowdown with minimal
damage. It attracts 70% of all foreign direct investment in Asia. Its
huge potential market will become even more attractive now that it's a
member of the World Trade Organization.</TE>
<TE>   That unnerves smaller Asian economies watching China erode their
competitive advantage. But officials among the businesspeople, academics
and politicians who gathered here for the inaugural Boao Forum for Asia
said they have little choice but to think of their giant neighbor as an
opportunity as well as a threat.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people feel we are all living in China's shadow," said Mah Bow
Tan, Singapore's minister for national development. "But I am cautiously
optimistic. As China grows, there will be positive spinoffs."</TE>
<TE>   To calm any anxiety, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji told the gathering of
about 1,900 people--including the prime ministers of Japan, Thailand and
South Korea--that "an economically developed China will pose no threat to
any country or region."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Zhu emphasized regional cooperation. One proposal he floated
was the creation of a free trade zone in Asia modeled on the North
American Free Trade Agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "This effort . . . will certainly speed up our economic development in
a spirit of free trade and mutual benefit," Zhu said.</TE>
<TE>   But that might take years to realize. Meanwhile, delegates felt the
growing pains of an all-Asian powwow. Logistical difficulties dominated
the two-day conference in this brand-new seaside resort. Guests struggled
from the moment they disembarked at an airport nearly two hours' drive
away. They wrestled during the rest of their stay with basic problems
that ranged from traveling to and from the convention venues and their
hotels to getting enough to eat.</TE>
<TE>   Apologetic organizers said the event was significantly oversubscribed.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Jiang Xiaosong, who is building this political Club Med from
scratch, told his guests that they were part of history in the making.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first saw this place in 1992, there were no roads, no
electricity," said Jiang, a Shanghai-born filmmaker turned real estate
tycoon.</TE>
<TE>   When completed, Boao will be a convention and vacation heaven, with at
least 30 hotels, six golf courses and various aquatic attractions and
theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang has the wherewithal to dream this way because he is connected
all the way to China's top. President Jiang Zemin was a friend and fan of
his late mother, Bai Yang, a renowned movie star.</TE>
<TE>   According to the developer, the Chinese president liked Boao so much
during the forum's pilot session last year that he composed a poem for
the forum and inked it with his official seal--a ringing endorsement, the
tycoon said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite emphasizing that this was a nongovernmental forum to increase
dialogue among Asian countries, China was clearly calling the shots.
Representatives from neighboring states who did not get on panels or felt
otherwise slighted took that as a sign of the times.</TE>
<TE>   "China is too large, too rapidly growing," said Mari Pangestu of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta, the Indonesian
capital. "How we manage this relationship is the biggest challenge in the
next century."</TE>
<TE>   And perhaps out of respect for their host, few public voices were
raised in dissent. Of course, there also was no trace of the
anti-globalization protesters who had become regular features at the
meetings in Davos.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy security cleared the roads and waterways here. Few people knew
that there were angry villagers just a short boat ride away. They will be
evicted by the next phase of development, which proposes to reward next
year's conference participants with a state-of-the-art convention center,
hotel complex and golf course.</TE>
<TE>   Out in the cold will be villagers whose ancestors have lived there for
more than 700 years.</TE>
<TE>   These people say the compensation the government promised them is
barely enough to build a new home farther inland. There will be nothing
left with which to put food on the table and send children to school.
Employment on Hainan is scarce, and they lack skills. Even the
construction jobs have gone to out-of-town workers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that we don't support the forum," Zhu Cimin, a 63-year-old
grandfather of seven, said at his home amid the island's trademark thick
vegetation and coconut groves. "But we are farmers. When we lose the
land, we lose everything. We understand our country needs to develop, but
so do we."</TE>

<HD>Priest Scandals a Deep Betrayal for Many Irish</HD>
<DH>Religion: Increasing allegations of abuse by the clergy have rocked
a nation that strongly identifies with Roman Catholicism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM GRAHAM</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>DUBLIN, Ireland
</DL>
<LD>It should have been nothing but joy when Cardinal Desmond Connell
celebrated Mass to mark the bicentenary of the birth of a founder of the
Christian Brothers order.</LD>
<LD>   But outside the Royal Dublin Society building where the service was
held this month, some of the 150 protesters broke down and wept for
childhoods that they said had been lost when they were abused by priests.</LD>
<LD>   "It just brings back bad memories for me," said George Bell, 54, of
Dublin, who now lives in Manchester, England. He said he had been "raped,
battered and abused" at the order's Upton Industrial School in Cork in
the late 1950s and early 1960s. "I just want them to be punished for what
they did."</LD>
<TE>   Such scandals have rocked dioceses across the United States, but these
are extraordinary times on this island where the lines separating church,
state and lifestyle often blur.</TE>
<TE>   To say this country is predominantly Roman Catholic is to understate
the power of centuries of sainted lore, an education system built to
support the church and generations of the faithful who sent their sons
off to spread the word. That much history has deepened the impact of the
scandal that dominates public discussions and even the letters to the
editor columns of local newspapers. Mary McAleese, president of Ireland,
weighed in recently, calling such abuse by clergy "a heinous betrayal of
trust."</TE>
<TE>   Even ordinary Catholics who have not been abused say their faith is
being tested. "The abuse of children by priests is so contrary to the
very heart of Christian teaching," said Joe Fitzpatrick, a Catholic in
Belfast, the provincial capital of Northern Ireland. "I have seen,
particularly, in the south of Ireland, a falloff in attendance at Mass
during the last two or three years."</TE>
<TE>Church Law Won't Hamper State Inquiry</TE>
<TE>   Almost weekly, there are new details about the amount of abuse and
questions about how completely the church will investigate. Following
discussions at a special meeting April 8 of the country's Catholic
bishops, Irish Primate Archbishop Sean Brady, the president of the
bishops conference, indicated that church law would not hinder
cooperation with any state inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   A week before the meeting, Brendan Comiskey, the bishop of Ferns in
County Wexford, resigned after complaints about how he handled charges of
abuse against priests in his diocese. The abuse focused on several
priests--including Father Sean Fortune, who committed suicide in 1999
shortly before he was to stand trial on 66 criminal counts of sexually
abusing boys.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic bishops said that the countrywide scandal had caused
great pain and shame to the church in Ireland, and they apologized for
inadequacies in tackling the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt a real depth of urgency about the need to establish a full
truth about how complaints of child sexual abuse have been dealt with,"
the bishops said in a statement. "The safety of children, the welfare of
victims and the common good are all supreme concerns and shall be the
sole determining factors in carrying out this audit so that the truth can
be established."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Irish Health Minister Micheal Martin appointed Senior
Counsel George Birmingham to examine what kind of state investigation
should be carried out.</TE>
<TE>   State authorities "will have full access to all church records in
every diocese in Ireland, and the bishops are determined this will happen
very quickly and the findings will be published," said Paul Bailey,
executive director of the church's Child Protection Office.</TE>
<TE>   Civil authorities had already announced an investigation into physical
and sexual abuse in child-care institutions in the last 60 years. A
commission headed by High Court Judge Mary Laffoy is leading the inquiry,
but its final report is not expected until at least 2005. The number of
those who wish to appear before the commission has doubled to more than
3,000. Most of the applications have come from Ireland but more than a
third are Irish living in Britain, other European countries, the United
States, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>Claims of Abuse Date to World War II</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Ireland's religious orders offered to pay $110
million to a fund compensating children sexually abused by their clergy.
The victims date to World War II and include former residents of
child-care institutions.</TE>
<TE>   One such former resident is John Kelly, coordinator of Irish Survivors
of Child Abuse, an organization of about 800 members who say they have
been abused by clergy. As a child, Kelly said, he was beaten and abused
at an institution for criminal youth run by the Christian Brothers order.
Kelly said a court sent him there for two years after he was convicted of
stealing chocolates.</TE>
<TE>   After a troubled life in London, where he worked as a station
inspector, he said he finally sought psychiatric help to cope with his
memories of abuse. He now lives in Dublin with his partner, Marie, and
their son, Ryan, 7.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to die," said Kelly, 51, one of the organizers of the
demonstration against Cardinal Connell. "I lost my religion. I lost God
that night."</TE>
<TE>   The Christian Brothers order has apologized for the abuse and its
leaders did so again at the commemorative Mass. There, Connell noted the
"unspeakable harm and suffering" to the victims and the suspicions that
have clouded how parishioners view their clergy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a profoundly difficult moment for the church, not only here
in Ireland," the cardinal said, "but as we know, in other parts of the
world."</TE>

<HD>Death Toll in Nepal Battle Rises to 160</HD>
<DH>Asia: Many of the victims are police officers beheaded by Maoist
rebels, authorities say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SATBARIYA, Nepal
</DL>
<LD>Marking the worst battle in a 6-year-old guerrilla war, Nepalese
authorities Saturday raised the death toll from a night of fighting to
about 160--many of them police beheaded by Maoist rebels.</LD>
<LD>   The jump in the toll--the government had reported 54 deaths
Friday--was announced by local officials to journalists who traveled
overnight by road to the two remote towns in western Nepal that saw most
of the fighting Thursday night and early Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Police Inspector Padam Vohra said 60 police officers were killed
Thursday while defending the house of Interior Security Minister Khum
Bahadur Khadka from a rebel attack. An additional 27 officers who
surrendered were beheaded, and two were burned alive, he said. About 30
officers survived.</LD>
<TE>   Vohra said 11 police officers were killed in an attack on a police
station in the nearby town of Lamahi. The two attacks set off overnight
gun battles that left hundreds of rebels dead, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses saw at least 60 bodies of guerrillas half-buried along a dry
riverbed a few miles from the minister's house. The bodies had apparently
been left by the retreating guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Thwran Thaket, a senior police constable, said he believed that the
rebels took many more fallen comrades in two trucks along with 95 rifles
and three machine guns looted from the slain officers.</TE>
<TE>   The minister's house was gutted by fire. Two burned sedans were parked
outside the 10-foot-high wall.</TE>
<TE>   On the ground were blotches of blood, shreds of police uniforms,
destroyed sofas and cupboards, and twisted, blackened bicycles. Glass
shards were scattered everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The 120 paramilitary police guarding the house were surrounded by
thousands of rebels, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are so ferocious that they killed officers . . . even after they
surrendered," Vohra said. "They were stripped naked, then paraded, and
finally beheaded with khukris," he said, referring to traditional
Nepalese knives.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks occurred in Dang district, about 190 miles west of the
capital, Katmandu.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is so bad that I don't know how long I will live," said
the Dang district's chief administrator, M.P. Yadav.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nobody to fight them. There is no equipment to fight them.
We are helpless, hapless," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, a bomb exploded near a school in the northwestern town
of Laltin Bazaar, killing three people, police said.</TE>

<HD>Operation Anaconda Leaves Bitterness in Its Wake</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Residents of battle-torn region say the U.S. bombed
their homes and killed their relatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GARDEZ, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Every morning, a forlorn procession of the bereft and the defeated
gathers at the gates of the governor's pale yellow compound in this
weather-beaten provincial outpost.</LD>
<LD>   There are widows and orphans and stooped old men, all of them bearing
tales of misery and loss written in flowing Persian script on slips of
paper. These are sullen, bitter people.</LD>
<LD>   "They are so angry, angry at the Americans," said Gen. Sahib Jan
Loodin Alozai, the deputy governor of Paktia province, who processes the
complaints. "They blame the Americans for all their troubles."</LD>
<TE>   Nearly a month has passed since American-led Operation Anaconda ended
here in the silver-capped mountains of eastern Afghanistan. Now the
Americans are targets of residual hate and resentment in a province where
support for the Taliban and the Al Qaeda terrorist network remains
strong.</TE>
<TE>   Some petitioners claim that American airstrikes killed their
relatives. Others claim that their homes were destroyed by American bombs
or missiles. Farmers complain that American soldiers have blocked access
to their fields, ruining their spring planting season. People on the
street glare and curse at passing American reporters. A Canadian reporter
was seriously wounded last month by a grenade tossed into her vehicle a
few miles outside town.</TE>
<TE>   This is Pushtun country. Many people here are hostile to foreigners
and sympathetic to the Pushtun-dominated Taliban. In their view, the
Americans are Christian invaders who installed an interim government in
Kabul dominated by the Pushtuns' ethnic rivals, Tajiks from the north.</TE>
<TE>   In place of routed Taliban fighters, the Americans have helped install
Pushtun commanders and fighters of the Tajik-dominated Northern Alliance
in and around Gardez. These veterans of Afghan civil wars teamed with the
American-led coalition forces to drive Taliban and Al Qaeda forces from
their redoubt in the Shahi Kot valley, 25 miles southeast of here.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the enemy on the run, the Americans and their Afghan allies
are confronting a wellspring of sympathy that allows the Taliban and Al
Qaeda forces to feed and arm themselves while they regroup. Unsigned
leaflets, known as shabnama, or "night letters," have appeared urging
Afghans to kill or kidnap foreign--especially American--journalists,
troops or aid workers.</TE>
<TE>   According to local officials, Taliban and Al Qaeda survivors have
withdrawn to the south and east, into the mountains of neighboring
Paktika province. They say others have retreated to the Pakistani Pushtun
tribal area known as Waziristan.</TE>
<TE>Fears of Resurgence</TE>
<TE>   But some are still active in the Shahi Kot valley, according to Capt.
Steven O'Connor, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition forces. O'Connor
said rockets were fired several miles from coalition troops on April 3,
causing no casualties but heightening fears of an enemy resurgence.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Tony de Reya, a British intelligence officer, said Taliban and Al
Qaeda fighters are engaged in a "tactical pause."</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Rahim, a U.S.-backed commander in Gardez, said that although
there might be as many as 900 surviving Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters to
the south and east, none are left in his town.</TE>
<TE>   "The only Al Qaeda and Taliban around here are dead ones," Rahim said
over a steaming lunch of meat and rice inside a command post.</TE>
<TE>   Rahim, a wiry little man with a hooked nose and a deep sunburn, said
his men continue to find enemy corpses, weapons, ammunition and training
manuals inside caves in the valley. About 50 caves have been cleared and
destroyed and a handful of suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters
captured, he said.</TE>
<TE>   American and coalition forces are conducting "clearance operations"
south and east of the Shahi Kot valley, Rahim said. Special Forces troops
launch missions from an adobe fortress guarded by Afghan gunmen on the
southern outskirts of Gardez. From time to time, American helicopters
swoop low over the rooftops as they head south in search of signs of the
enemy.</TE>
<TE>   But in Gardez, many consider the Americans the enemy. Two incidents,
in particular, have stoked passions here.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 20, American warplanes killed 50 to 60 people in a convoy in
Paktia. Survivors said the victims were tribal elders headed to Kabul,
the Afghan capital, for the inauguration of interim Prime Minister Hamid
Karzai. The Pentagon said the dead were Taliban members who had opened
fire on the planes.</TE>
<TE>   On March 6, the Pentagon has acknowledged, women and children were
among 14 people killed by an American airstrike on an Al Qaeda convoy
fleeing the Shahi Kot valley. The civilians were family members traveling
with Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "There were women and children in that convoy," Sayed Aminullah, an
Afghan worker for CARE International in Gardez, said of the March attack.
"You don't drop bombs on them, whatever the reason."</TE>
<TE>   Aminullah said that although he and many others in Gardez are grateful
to the Americans for removing the Taliban, and especially the foreign
fighters of Al Qaeda, "the killing of innocents has filled everyone with
anger."</TE>
<TE>   Local officials claim, variously, that a dozen, 50, or more than 100
civilians were killed by American ordnance during Operation Anaconda.
Alozai, the deputy governor, said he had processed 12 death claims but
anticipates more. Townspeople say the numbers are much higher. With
bodies buried and witnesses dispersed, an accurate total probably will
never emerge.</TE>
<TE>   "Not even the angels know the correct number," Aminullah said.</TE>
<TE>   In Kabul, the Ministry of Martyrs and the Disabled tries to track
civilian war deaths nationwide. But the agency's deputy minister, Baz
Mohammed Zormati, said the Gardez region has not been surveyed because
his employees are afraid to travel there.</TE>
<TE>   Zormati, a Pushtun from Zormat, just south of Gardez, said he too
refuses to go to Gardez. He supported the Northern Alliance, he said, and
a bounty was put on his head by Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, who
remains at large.</TE>
<TE>   "If I went," Zormati said, "maybe I would not return alive."</TE>
<TE>   Both the deputy governor and a local CARE official, Mohammed Rahim,
say the homes of 200 to 300 people from 50 to 60 families were destroyed
by American warplanes. Most of those homes were being used as military
posts by Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters who had evicted villagers in the
Shahi Kot valley, both officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The families have besieged the governor's office with demands for
American compensation, Alozai said. He said he relayed their complaints
to "Mr. Mike," his American military contact in Gardez, but received no
reply. American officials say the State Department and Pentagon are
studying the issue but have reached no decision.</TE>
<TE>Locals Not Consulted</TE>
<TE>   Alozai, a Pushtun who took office six weeks ago, said the Americans
did not consult local officials before launching Operation Anaconda.</TE>
<TE>   If they had, he said, they might have negotiated a Taliban and Al
Qaeda surrender, although U.S. commanders have said the enemy refused to
surrender even when trapped or wounded. And several months earlier,
Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters apparently slipped away while negotiations
on a surrender were underway farther north in Tora Bora.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans didn't show respect for our customs, and that has left
a bitter taste," Alozai said.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, the people in Gardez need foreigners to hate," Alozai said.
"They used to hate the Russians. Now they hate the Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Even Rahim, the commander, said he was not entirely satisfied with the
conduct of his American patrons.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he said, he had good relations with his American liaison officer,
"Commander Brent." And, yes, he fought alongside the Americans at Shahi
Kot, and 130 of his 600 fighters are being trained by the Americans, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But still, he said, it pains him that American warplanes killed
civilians when they attacked a Taliban munitions depot in the settlement
of Qalaye Niazy near Gardez on Dec. 29. Rahim claimed that 100 civilians
living nearby were killed along with enemy fighters, but he offered no
proof.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans never said they were sorry, or that they made a
mistake," Rahim said. "They just said every dead person was Taliban or Al
Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   He shook his head vigorously. "This is my area. I know the people. I
know who's Taliban and who's Al Qaeda. These were just ordinary people."</TE>
<TE>   An American reporter was escorted to the site, down a rocky dirt track
northwest of Gardez, by one of Rahim's soldiers, a pimply-faced young man
with an automatic rifle slung across his back. After complaining that his
commander had yet to pay him a single afghani in salary, the soldier,
Shaneef Shah, 22, led the way to a settlement of five flattened mud
compounds.</TE>
<TE>   Beside the ruins, nomads known as Kochis had pitched their tents.
Women in red and crimson robes squatted in the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   The largest compound had been the home of a Kochi who had served as a
Taliban commander, Shah said. The man had gathered weapons and ammunition
abandoned by fellow Taliban during their retreat from Gardez and trucked
them to his compound.</TE>
<TE>   When American warplanes flattened the depot in a series of strikes
Dec. 29, Shah said, the commander and several Taliban were killed, but so
were civilians in nearby homes. Shah said local Kochis estimated the
number of dead at 50, as did a recent U.N. report.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, 16 graves had recently been dug, their white mourning flags
whipping in the fierce desert wind. Shah said other victims had been
taken elsewhere and buried.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the ammunition had survived the airstrike. Asked why his
commanders had not gathered it for their own use, Shah replied, "Because
it's sitting in the middle of a minefield."</TE>
<TE>   Shah suddenly grew anxious, but not because of mines. He said he
feared that Kochi gunmen would arrive to find an American poking through
Kochi homes that had been bombed by American planes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid for you," he told the American. "And for me, too."</TE>

<HD>Northern Israel Residents Fear a Broader War</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Many are thinking about leaving as cross-border attacks by
guerrillas threaten to spark a conflict with Lebanon and Syria.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AVIVIM, Israel
</DL>
<LD>Razor wire curls around the nectarine and almond trees flowering in
this tiny farming community a few yards from Israel's border with
Lebanon.</LD>
<LD>   Farmers are buying guns. The children spend afternoons in bomb
shelters. Bullet holes pockmark the local military base. And many
families are thinking of leaving.</LD>
<LD>   "People are terrified now," said Haim Briton, 32, who heard shots whiz
by his head last week as he tended his fruit trees growing along the
border fence. "All day, every day, we are in great danger."</LD>
<TE>   For the first time in decades, Hezbollah and Palestinian guerrillas
are repeatedly attacking small northern Israeli towns and military bases
outside the traditionally disputed territory along the frontier.</TE>
<TE>   Launched in response to Israel's offensive in the West Bank, the
attacks threaten to broaden the conflict into a wider war with Lebanon
and Syria, which back the radical groups.</TE>
<TE>   And they could draw the Israeli army into a demanding, two-front
conflict that would drain resources and invite even more intensive
terrorist activity by Palestinian militants within the country.</TE>
<TE>   "This place could escalate in minutes," said Maj. Dinor Shavit, an
officer in the northern command responsible for the border.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two weeks, Hezbollah batteries have launched Katyusha
rockets against several small towns along Israel's borders with Lebanon
and Syria. Guerrillas have fired machine guns and launched mortar rounds
at Israeli surveillance stations and military outposts.</TE>
<TE>   There have been 23 attacks, including gun and mortar assaults, since
January against border areas, including a disputed region that Hezbollah
claims belongs to Lebanon. That compares with 19 over the last two years.
Mortar and rocket attacks have long taken place in the disputed region,
known as Shabaa Farms, but they now occur almost nightly.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the attacks have failed to do serious damage. Several soldiers
have been wounded, and some military buildings have been hit. No
civilians have been killed or injured.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, many Israeli political and military figures speculate
that the attacks are intended to divert Israeli military forces from the
West Bank, or are meant as a political gesture by Hezbollah to
demonstrate support for the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The danger remains, however, that a stray round or a rogue militant
could end up killing a civilian. And that would bring retaliation of some
sort against Lebanon, Syria or both.</TE>
<TE>   Yossi Sarid, leader of a left-wing opposition party, is intimately
aware of the dangers. During a recent visit to his second home in the
northern border town of Margaliyot, he stepped outside his front porch to
watch mortar shells burst against a distant mountain.</TE>
<TE>   From his kitchen window, he could see Hezbollah guerrillas at a border
post a few hundred yards away prepare their breakfast. Rockets had sailed
over his home in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   "One shot through a window, and the Israelis will come. Once a border
village is attacked, retaliation will be inevitable," he said. "The whole
Middle East will be in a war that no one intended to launch."</TE>
<TE>   One of the sad things about the new wave of attacks is that the border
region along Lebanon and Israel has defied expectations since Israeli
troops withdrew from southern Lebanon two years ago, ending nearly two
decades of occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of renewed border skirmishes, communities on both sides
experienced two years of relative calm. Israeli towns saw an influx of
tourists. Unemployment dropped, and industry returned. Lebanese families
returned to towns abandoned during the occupation and began planting
crops along the border again.</TE>
<TE>   But the recent surge in violence has reversed those gains, at least
along the Israeli side. Avivim is a case in point.</TE>
<TE>   The town, a collective farm known as a moshav, lies only a few yards
from the rusted fence that marks the border with Lebanon, in a remote
region of northern Israel. This time of year, bright red poppies and
yellow daisies fill broad meadows. The rolling hills are green, filled
with the scent of pine and fruit blossoms.</TE>
<TE>   The town is surrounded by orchards, chicken coops and Lebanon. An
Israeli military surveillance station sits on one side of the town.
Villagers can see Hezbollah guerrillas guarding their own outposts on the
hills above.</TE>
<TE>   Two Katyusha rockets and several mortar shells came streaking from
those hills April 7 about 6 p.m., according to villagers and military
officials. A few moments later, as residents ran with their children to
the village's cheerily painted bomb shelters, Hezbollah guerrillas pulled
alongside the fence in several cars and opened fire with a machine gun.</TE>
<TE>   The attack seemed directed mostly at the surveillance outpost. A
rocket landed close to the guard shack, leaving a black hole in the
ground. Bullets nicked holes in the building. At least four soldiers were
injured.</TE>
<TE>   The only damage done to the town was in the chicken coops, where eggs
were shattered.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it reminded villagers of the dark times in the 1970s and early
1980s when such attacks were frequent. A monument in the center of the
village commemorates the deaths of 12 children in an attack against the
village's school bus.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers have stopped going out into their fields, leading to economic
worries. After-school activities now take place in bomb shelters that
have been wired for computers and television sets. And some farmers have
begun to arm themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never been frightened like we are frightened today," said
Joshua Levi, a 26-year-old egg farmer. "We are hoping things will be OK,
but we have no idea what will happen."</TE>
<TE>   Menara, a small kibbutz a few miles up a winding mountain road from
Avivim, has not been attacked, though a nearby Israeli military post was
hit by small-arms fire April 7.</TE>
<TE>   But the sound of rockets fired on another nearby town has echoed
through the community, located on cliffs overlooking the Hula valley. And
the threat of violence has scared away tourists. Of 51 guest rooms, none
are occupied.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable. Nothing happened all along [Menara's] border until
last month," said Dan Ilan, the 65-year-old community director.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the quiet place to be," Ilan said. "Since things have heated
up, nobody is coming here."</TE>
<TE>   The attacks have not been confined to small villages. In Kiryat
Shemona, the largest regional town, Katyusha rockets have begun falling,
leaving fragments in outlying areas, according to locals and Israeli
military officials.</TE>
<TE>   The rockets have not done any damage to the town or its residents. But
they have brought back memories of the past, when about 36 local people
were killed and many more wounded in hundreds of such attacks before the
Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   The question for many here is what the Israeli army will do. There is
no appetite for an invasion of Lebanon or Syria, though Sarid, the
opposition leader, said such a move could not be ruled out.</TE>
<TE>   Most Israelis here in northern Israel continue to call for restraint.
Kiryat Shemona's mayor has gone so far as to ask that the military stay
put even if civilians are killed by accident.</TE>
<TE>   "If we remain restrained, everything can return to normal," Mayor Haim
Barbivai said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, efforts to stop the bombing have focused on Syria, which also
wields considerable power in Lebanon. Vice President Dick Cheney called
Syrian President Bashar Assad to ask him to halt the operations. In a
visit to the region Friday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell demanded
the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Powell received a briefing on the situation from Israeli
military officials, mortar shells flew across the disputed border about
20 miles away.</TE>

<HD>Unlike Arafat, Sharon Won Bush's Trust</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DOYLE McMANUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In December 1998, shortly before he decided to run for president,
then-Gov. George W. Bush made a three-day visit to Israel and came home
with two indelible memories.</LD>
<LD>   One was of standing on the hill in the Galilee where Jesus preached
the Sermon on the Mount, and reciting the words to "Amazing Grace." The
other was of a helicopter tour over Israel's narrow 1967 boundaries and
the occupied West Bank--a tour conducted personally by then-Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon.</LD>
<LD>   On the same trip, Bush also sought a meeting with Yasser Arafat, but
the Palestinian Authority president turned him down, missing a priceless
political opportunity.</LD>
<TE>   Ever since, Bush's relationships with the Middle East's two bitter
antagonists have followed much the same pattern. Sharon has cultivated
the president and has largely won Bush's confidence--not only by
embracing the U.S. war on terrorism but also by being frank when he
disagrees with U.S. policies.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, for example, Sharon told Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
that while he would withdraw his forces from the West Bank, it wouldn't
be as quickly as the U.S. wanted. After reports that U.S. officials were
unhappy with that message, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer
pointedly praised Sharon as "a man of peace."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, in contrast, has impressed Bush as indecisive and
untrustworthy.</TE>
<TE>   "He never earned my trust," Bush recently said of the Palestinian. "In
order to earn my trust, somebody must keep their word. And Chairman
Arafat has not kept his word. He said he would fight off terror. He
hasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Now that Bush has stepped fully into Middle East peacemaking, the
president faces a paradox: To get the conflict under control, he must be
cautious about endorsing the actions of Sharon, the man he trusts, and
accept the need to deal with Arafat, the man he doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, statements from the White House sometimes seem to carry a
mixed message: calling for Israeli restraint but praising Sharon,
excoriating Arafat, but approving Powell's decision to meet with him.</TE>
<TE>   The president's support for Israel and his distaste for Arafat are
undimmed, aides say. But the lessons of his first full week of
high-profile peacemaking were summed up by a weary White House official
Saturday: "It's going to be a long, hard road."</TE>
<TE>   Ten days ago, Bush stood in the White House Rose Garden and demanded a
clear statement from Arafat denouncing suicide bombers and a clear
commitment from Sharon for a rapid withdrawal of troops from the West
Bank. He reinforced the message with telephone calls to foreign leaders
and in daily conversations with Powell. But it took more than a week to
persuade Arafat to comply--and Sharon still hasn't said when he plans to
end his military offensive.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials insist that Bush hasn't been surprised by the
tough going.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not have high expectations for this trip," one said. "Nobody
thought we were going to get a dramatic success or a breakthrough."</TE>
<TE>   The apparent paradoxes in U.S. policy stem from the nature of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, officials say. In the short run, they argue,
Sharon is right to crack down on Palestinian terrorism; in the long run,
the administration will urge him to reach out to the Palestinians and
make peace. In the short run, the Palestinians have rallied around
Arafat, and there is no one else Powell or Sharon can deal with; in the
long run, the administration wants to encourage a new generation of more
moderate Palestinians to take the lead, a goal that seems impractical in
the middle of a war.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's sympathy for Sharon's position appears undiminished despite the
Israeli's failure to withdraw his troops. Sharon and other Israeli
officials have argued that their campaign against Palestinian terrorism
is no different from Bush's counter-terrorism effort after the Sept. 11
attacks, and they appear to have hit a nerve.</TE>
<TE>   "On Sharon's side, the terrorism has become unbearable," a senior
official said. "You have to understand how it is in Israel. . . . There
are strategic concerns over the long run, but in the short run support
for Sharon's strategy is over 80% [among Israelis].</TE>
<TE>   "When the president made his call [for withdrawal] they were in as
many as 40 towns. Now they are down to four major towns and two or three
minor places," he said. "[Sharon] has actually been very responsive."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon denounced Powell's interest in meeting with Arafat as "a tragic
mistake," but the official said Bush was not offended by the blunt
disagreement. "[Sharon] said clearly that he doesn't favor dealing with
Arafat, but he also said it's a decision Secretary Powell has to make,"
the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, on the other hand, has never established the same kind of link
with Bush. Before Bush came to the White House, one ally said, the main
thing he knew about Arafat was that the Palestinian leader backed Iraq's
Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Persian Gulf War--against the current
president's father.</TE>
<TE>   Bush repeatedly called on Arafat to crack down on the wave of
Palestinian terrorism, which began in late 2000. Bush sought to hold out
an alternative path for Arafat by declaring his support for an
independent Palestinian state, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. intelligence agencies reported back to the president that
Arafat was encouraging some attacks against Israel and tolerating others.
Last November, when Arafat sought a meeting with Bush at the United
Nations to offer support in the U.S. war on terrorism, the president
turned him down.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat sent assurances to Bush that he was renouncing terrorism for
good, officials said. But in January, Israel intercepted a shipload of
weapons from Iran, and the CIA agreed with the Israeli assessment that
Arafat's closest aides were involved. "Ordering up weapons . . . is not
part of fighting terror, that's enhancing terror," Bush complained.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Bush made clear that he would prefer to be dealing with a
different Palestinian leader. But other Arab leaders and other
Palestinians told Bush and Powell that there is no alternative to Arafat
today. If anything, administration officials acknowledge, the Israeli
offensive has made Arafat more popular.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat is a fact of life," one official said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the administration's strategy is to attempt to negotiate
a cease-fire between Sharon and Arafat in the short run, and then to
encourage other Palestinians to step forward in the long run. But they
have offered no details as to how they hope to accomplish that, beyond
repeating U.S. willingness to support a new leadership if and when it
arises.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of dealing with Arafat is not universally popular within the
administration. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and other
hard-liners have argued for a clearer break with the Palestinian leader,
according to some Republicans. (The Pentagon refuses to say what
Rumsfeld's advice to the president has been.) Outside the White House,
conservative Republicans--and some Democrats--have called on Bush to
break relations with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "I think one of the things this president is learning is that you
can't personalize this issue," said Sen. Charles Hagel (R-Neb.), a member
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is close to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, he has feelings and passions and emotions. But it is very
dangerous to allow those to control your decisions with the best
interests of the country and the world at stake. Quite frankly, it's
irrelevant what you think of Arafat. The fact is, he's the elected leader
of the Palestinian Authority. The Arab leaders recognize him. . . . He's
a player whether you want it or not.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes beyond the political dimension of 'Oh my goodness, this will
drag me and my standing into the underbrush.' I don't believe that will
happen. I think the American people will give him credit for dealing with
it; that whether he succeeds or fails, at least he tried. . . .</TE>
<TE>   "Every president since Harry S. Truman has gotten consumed by it. It's
just a fact of life."</TE>

<HD>Gruesome Change From the Ordinary</HD>
<DH>Conflict: A quiet, young seamstress further widened the Mideast
breach when she joined the ranks of Palestinian suicide bombers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIT FAJJAR, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>The family and friends of Andalib Takafka gathered Saturday to
celebrate not a life but a death. Andalib was 18 and had lived an
uneventful life. Everything about the girl, her mother said, meaning no
unkindness, was ordinary.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the teenager rose at 6 and made tea for her parents, as she
did most days. She left her home in this West Bank town near Bethlehem
without a word. "Andalib was always quiet," her mother said. Her parents
supposed she was going to her job as a seamstress.</LD>
<LD>   But that particular morning, she was headed for Jerusalem. Somewhere
she made a stop to pick up the tools of death. Then, shortly after 4 p.m.
on crowded Jaffa Street, she blew herself sky high, killing, herself and
six others and wounding more than 80. Her victims included Arabs and
Jews. They were all civilians.</LD>
<TE>   As has happened scores of times in Israel during the last 18 months,
an ordinary life had turned into an extraordinary death and the echo
traveled far.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell responded by canceling his Saturday
meeting with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. Arafat,
desperate for U.S. help to halt the Israeli offensive in the West Bank,
responded by condemning all forms of terrorism, specifically that one
committed by Andalib Takafka. Their meeting was rescheduled for today.</TE>
<TE>   When they gathered Saturday afternoon in the family compound, the
girl's relatives did not know that Arafat had not, publicly at least,
bestowed martyr status on Andalib. The women sat in one room with Aziza
Takafka, 44, who held a picture of her daughter. They talked quietly,
without the tears and wailing that mark wakes for those killed by the
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   "Andalib was just ordinary," her mother said. "She was an ordinary
student. She did ordinary things like every teenager. She never seemed
political. I could never imagine her doing a thing like this. If I had
known she was planning it, of course I would have pleaded with her to
stop. I am a mother."</TE>
<TE>   In the next room, the men sat with Khalil Takafka, 66, Andalib's
father, smoking and drinking coffee. Festive music played on a tape
recorder. He said he was proud of what his daughter did. And what if his
eight other children also decided to become suicide bombers?</TE>
<TE>   "They are free," he said. "If they want to do it, it is up to them."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Takafkas could not explain what had transformed their
daughter into someone willing to kill and be killed, they said they had
seen changes in her in recent weeks, as she sat transfixed watching TV
news reports of the military campaign Israel launched in late March
precisely because of youths like Andalib.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes she looked so sad, it made me cry," the father said.</TE>
<TE>   About three weeks ago, her mother said, Andalib began to spend more
time reading the Koran. There were moments, between the periods of
sadness, when Andalib seemed very happy and was always smiling. Aziza
Takafka asked her daughter why she seemed so happy.</TE>
<TE>   Andalib said, "Mother, someone is going to ask for my hand in
marriage. Please say yes," Aziza Takafka recalled. But the mother knew
that in conservative Palestinian society, a girl doesn't suddenly show up
at home with a mysterious boyfriend, and she began wondering whether her
daughter was referring to someone other than a husband.</TE>
<TE>   The bomber was originally identified on TV as a woman named Nidal
Daraghmeh. So the Takafkas had no idea that their daughter was
responsible until 200 Israelis rolled into Beit Fajjar in armored
personnel carriers at 1:30 a.m. Saturday and headed for the Takafkas'
modest home on an unpaved street.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers questioned family members in separate rooms and left with
Andalib's brother, Ali, 19.</TE>
<TE>   Beit Fajjar is a quiet village, isolated from the fighting of the last
month, which makes Andalib Takafka's emergence as a suicide bomber all
the more unusual.</TE>
<TE>   What does seem clear is that, although many Palestinians cheer the
bombers as martyrs, the attackers often end up accomplishing the opposite
of their goals. Bombings are met by a tough Israeli response, which has
largely destroyed the Palestinians' infrastructure in the West Bank. And
rather than gathering sympathy for the Palestinian cause, the
bombings--which are aimed at civilians--have caused revulsion in the
international community.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no other opportunity to strike back," said Mahmoud Eliam, a
teacher in Beit Fajjar for 40 years. "We don't want to kill innocent
people, but the bombings are a sign of our desperation."</TE>

<HD>Arafat Statement Decries Terror Activities</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The statement issued Saturday by Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat on the WAFA news agency, translated from Arabic:</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinian leadership and his excellency, President Arafat,
express their deep condemnation for all terrorist activities, whether it
is state terrorism, terrorism by a group or individual terrorism. This
position comes from our steady principle that rejects using violence and
terror against civilians as a way to achieve political goals.</LD>
<LD>   We declared this position beginning in 1988 and also when we signed
the Oslo accords at the White House, and we have repeated it several
times before, including our declaration on Dec. 16 last year. After that,
we did not find any Israeli response but more Israeli escalation, a
tighter siege, further occupation of our people, refugee camps, cities,
villages, and more destruction of our infrastructure.</LD>
<TE>   We strongly condemn all the attacks targeting civilians from both
sides, and especially the attack that took place against Israeli citizens
yesterday in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   We also condemn very strongly the massacre that was committed by the
Israeli occupation troops against our refugees in Jenin and against our
people in Ramallah, Nablus and Tulkarm and also the brutal aggression
against the church in Bethlehem during the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   We call on the international community, the U.N. Security Council and
Mr. Colin Powell to undertake an international peace mission in the
region to investigate these massacres against our people because of the
Israeli occupation and to investigate the Israeli government's
determination to kill the Palestinian hope for liberty and freedom by
using military forces, tanks, missiles and weapons.</TE>
<TE>   On behalf of the Palestinian people, we once again emphasize our full
commitment to a fair and just peace between the two peoples and two
states as a strategic choice--peace that could provide security for the
Israelis and liberty and freedom in an independent state for the
Palestinian people. Only through peace will security be achieved for
everyone, not through occupation and military operations, massacres and
terrorist attacks, especially against civilians, which will not provide
peace and security for either Palestinians or Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   We have to all work together, especially after the recent U.N.
resolutions, the statement of President Bush and his secretary of State,
the statement that came from the international committee overseeing
cease-fire efforts, and also in light of the mission by Mr. Colin Powell
and his presence here among us to stop this war and bring about an
immediate Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories and
immediate implementation of the [George J.] Tenet understandings and
[George J.] Mitchell report and the resumption of negotiations based on
what was decided in the Arab summit, and the Saudi Arabian initiative
that was adopted by the Arab [League] summit in Beirut to protect
Christian and Muslim holy places and the importance of having
international peace forces follow up and monitor the implementation of
all this.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>STRASBOURG, France
</DL>
<LD>Vandals have desecrated a Jewish cemetery in Strasbourg with
swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans in an attack that President Jacques
Chirac denounced Saturday as scandalous.</LD>
<LD>   The symbols and slogans, painted on about 20 tombstones and a wall,
were discovered Friday. Chirac, in the newspaper Le Progres, said: "These
were scandalous acts that go against the foundations of French identity.
. . . They should be opposed with utmost vigor."</LD>
<LD>   Police have opened an inquiry into the incident, the fourth at a
Jewish site in the Cronenbourg section of Strasbourg during Israel's West
Bank offensive.</LD>
<TE>   In Paris, police sources said 10 to 12 anti-Semitic attacks were
reported in France daily, ranging from anti-Jewish graffiti to physical
attacks on Jews and their schools, synagogues and shops.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine denounced the vandalism, saying on
French radio: "Nothing that happens in the Middle East can justify racist
and anti-Semitic acts or attacks on Jewish school buses or schools or
burning synagogues."</TE>
<TE>   An unexploded bomb was found at another Cronenbourg cemetery early
this month after an arson attack there and a fire at a nearby synagogue.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>The Toronto Jewish Film Festival is dropping a documentary on
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon because of security concerns.</LD>
<LD>   The festival's organizers say the award-winning film, "The Accused,"
based on Sharon's life, could invite unwanted attention from interest
groups.</LD>
<LD>   "This seems to be a more explosive year security-wise, so we're just
trying to be careful," Helen Zukerman, the festival's executive director,
said Friday. "We don't want it co-opted by some special interest groups
that might seize it to make their own political statement."</LD>
<TE>   The BBC film was to be screened April 23 and was to be followed by a
question-and-answer session with its English producer, Aidan Laverty, who
is working on a project in Afghanistan and could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The film investigates Sharon's involvement in the 1982 Israeli
invasion of Lebanon, which was sparked by the attempted assassination of
Israeli Ambassador Shlomo Argov in London.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, who was the Israeli defense minister at the time, allegedly
facilitated the assault on the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut
by a Christian militia.</TE>
<TE>   The assault turned into a massacre. Death toll estimates range from
700 to 3,500.</TE>

<HD>Yoga Purists Mourn Spiritual Discipline's Loss of Innocence</HD>
<DH>Health: A movement to restore tradition begins among those who see
its purpose drifting away from toning the mind toward toning the body.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE BOORSTEIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Heated to precisely 105 degrees, the Bikram yoga studio is so hot
the windows look like it's raining--inside. And then there are the 25
very sweaty bodies, all trying to stretch themselves into increasingly
strenuous positions as the teacher calls out an occasional "Don't panic!"</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes they do, bolting from the carpeted sweatbox for a few
minutes' respite in the hall.</LD>
<LD>   "The smell is intense in there," says one man, guzzling water and
pacing the corridor before heading back to finish the 90-minute class.</LD>
<TE>   To some who practice yoga, there is something far more offensive at
the Manhattan studio than the heat or stench. To them, this newfangled
yoga represents the biggest threat the spiritual discipline has faced
since people began practicing it more than 5,000 years ago in
India--fasting, abstaining from sex and meditating in search of higher
consciousness.</TE>
<TE>Yoga Golf?</TE>
<TE>   They fear that the discovery of yoga by millions of Americans is
killing its soul, distorting its purpose from pursuit of a better self to
pursuit of a better butt.</TE>
<TE>   Among the things that scare them: $38 skimpy "chakra" tank tops, disco
yoga and a Web site called "Yogasm: Where Yoga Meets Fashion." Car ads
that show a person meditating in front of a sport utility vehicle.
Aerobics teachers who take two-day yoga courses that supposedly prepare
them to do a job intended for spiritual gurus. Yoga golf.</TE>
<TE>   Now a movement is afoot to return yoga to its more traditional roots.
To replace sweating with meditation, hip hop with silence. To supplant
Madonna as the face of yoga with people more the likes of Patanjali, the
man who standardized the ancient philosophical texts about 800 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "When yoga was in its womb in India, it was safe and protected, but as
it ventures into the harsh world, it is in danger of disintegrating,"
said Scott Gerson, a prominent alternative medicine expert and internist
in New York who has practiced yoga since the 1970s. Gerson refers to most
of the newer yoga classes as "debauchment."</TE>
<TE>   Yoga purists such as Gerson are calling for a return to teaching yoga
in its original form, a program aimed at seeking self-enlightenment by
training the mind. The physical postures, or asanas, most people think of
as yoga are just one segment and were meant to be part of a years-long
path of study that includes practicing nonviolence, restraint and
meditation.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, however, yoga has been vigorously Americanized,
repackaged, re-marketed and spit out in a multitude of images, primarily
one with a hard body. It is now taught everywhere from hip city gyms such
as Crunch on Miami's South Beach to grimy basement studios on Manhattan's
Lower East Side, and even at the Monroeville, Pa., Senior Center, where
class meets right before quilting and pinochle.</TE>
<TE>   According to Yoga Journal, the industry's biggest magazine, 15 million
people practice yoga in the United States, up from 12 million in 1998. In
that time, the magazine's circulation has nearly tripled, to 250,000.</TE>
<TE>   A frequent target of yoga purists is the genre practiced by Bikram
instructor Raffael Pacitti, a popular form known as "hot yoga" because it
calls for 90 minutes of deep stretching in a heated, carpeted room.
Founder Bikram Choudhury, a childhood yoga champion in his native India
who now lives in Beverly Hills, says the heat means it is easier to
stretch. It also means the air smells like a massive pile of soiled gym
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "The most exciting, hard-working, effective, amusing and glamorous
yoga class in the world!" promises Bikram Yoga's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The fear of purists is embodied in the locker room at Bikram, where
one sweaty young woman finished the class and exulted, "I could die right
now and be perfectly happy."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the women leaving Pacitti's class don't know that classical
yoga often has little to do with stretching, and certainly not with
strenuous positions or movements fast enough to make you sweat.</TE>
<TE>   Maty Ezraty, who runs a popular yoga center in Santa Monica, sounds
heartbroken when she talks about Americans' "physical addiction to
sweating" and how she feels it is afflicting yoga.</TE>
<TE>   As a longtime yoga practitioner, Ezraty feels she is seeing a profound
philosophy and lifestyle reduced to nothing more than an alternative to
step aerobics or kick-boxing. But as a businesswoman, she knows she can't
fight the market.</TE>
<TE>   At YogaWorks, Ezraty offers the athletic style Ashtanga, or "power
yoga," as well as meditation and deep breathing.</TE>
<TE>   "Senior people are looking in awe at these sweat classes, and it's
really sad," she says. "But it's a real dilemma because these workout
classes are so popular--there's no stopping them. Yoga teachers who see
yoga as more than exercise are caught."</TE>
<TE>   The bandwagon of those cashing in on yoga's popularity is crowded. It
ranges from YogaFit, a company that trains teachers over a single
weekend, to individuals such as Alan Ripka and Ashok Wahi.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Ripka, a Manhattan lawyer, opened a yoga center whose
classes are broadcast live on the Internet. It caters to businesspeople
too busy to leave their office and stay-at-home parents. Wahi, a
mechanical engineer and longtime yoga practitioner from Hillsborough,
N.J., designed a nine-minute program specifically for golfers. He began
selling it last year.</TE>
<TE>   Wahi brushes off criticism about the mainstreaming of yoga. "It's like
math versus applied math; my approach is applied yoga."</TE>
<TE>   John Tunney understands that middle ground. A yoga teacher and founder
of one of the biggest yoga information Web
sites--http://www.yogasite.com--Tunney sees everything from new teachers
ignorant of basic yoga terminology to those who want to know if yoga can
reduce knee flab.</TE>
<TE>   While he understands purists' desire to aim for total
self-realization, Tunney thinks it may be unrealistic to create the ideal
cocoon in busy American life.</TE>
<TE>   "I treat it as a spiritual discipline, but that doesn't mean I expect
to be a long-bearded swami sitting on a mountain. For me, yoga is about
being in the world." That said, he thinks the spiritual benefits of yoga
sneak up on even those on a quest for a toned tummy. "The thing about
yoga is that it works whether you believe in it or not," said Tunney, of
West Orange, N.J.</TE>
<TE>Spiritual Training</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the movement to revive yoga's classic principles is on.</TE>
<TE>   The Yoga Alliance, a group of prominent yoga teachers, launched a
formal registry of trained teachers in 1997. Teachers who have the
alliance stamp must have at least 200 hours of training, including 30
hours of philosophy and their own teacher--something closer to the
ancient system of apprenticing.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the mainstream Yoga Journal, an ad reminds readers: "Asana is
just the beginning," while a letter to the editor asks why the magazine
uses photographs of women who "look like they belong in Cosmopolitan."
The author closes with: "I wonder what the ancients would think of this?"</TE>
<TE>   Concern about the future of yoga is also coming from the home of its
past, India.</TE>
<TE>   Several prominent conferences there in recent years have focused on
how to return yoga to its roots. Subodh Tiwari, administrator of the
Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute in Lonavala, India, said leaders from most
different yoga wings agreed in 1998 to promote yoga in its authentic
form.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't modify yoga to suit persons, because persons have various
personalities and we can't change it according to each and every person,"
he said from Lonavala.</TE>
<TE>   Tiwari said the practice of newfangled, sweat-oriented yoga has
bounced back overseas to India.</TE>
<TE>   At the Chicago branch of Sivananda, one of the most traditional yoga
schools, director Chandrashekara is reluctant to criticize the new yoga
classes. After all, he says, "being judgmental isn't good for our
health."</TE>
<TE>   But he offers his opinion in an apt metaphor: "To call these classes
yoga, it's really a stretch."</TE>

<HD>Pro-Israel Rally at Capitol Expected to Draw Tens of Thousands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK NEUBAUER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of people from across the country are expected to
attend a rally at the Capitol on Monday to demonstrate solidarity with
Israel and to declare that its military operations in the West Bank are
part of the global battle against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "America and Israel are engaged in a common critical struggle against
those who are responsible for inciting, supporting and harboring
terrorists who are responsible for atrocities like the September 11
attacks and the Passover Massacre," rally sponsors said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   Plans for the rally come at a time when tension has risen between
President Bush and the Israeli government over its continued offensive
into Palestinian territory. Some critics view the president's requests
for Israel to pull back even though Palestinian suicide bombings continue
as being inconsistent with his war on terrorism. At the same time,
protests against Israeli policy have erupted on some U.S. college
campuses.</LD>
<TE>   But sponsors of Monday's rally are skirting the specifics of the
tangled and divisive issue, preferring instead to emphasize broad support
for Israel and denunciation of terrorism as issues on which all Americans
can agree.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a rally against terrorism. It is about people, not policy,"
said Robert Hyfler, chief executive of one of the rally's supporters, the
Jewish Federation of Greater Washington. "Terrorism is not a political
weapon."</TE>
<TE>   The rally is being sponsored by the mainstream Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and its approximately
50 members as well as the United Jewish Communities, another umbrella
group.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to show the people of Israel that we stand with them at this
difficult time when so many have been the victims of terrorist outrages
including scores of suicide bombings and attacks which in the month of
March alone took more than 100 lives," Conference Chairman Mortimer
Zuckerman and Executive Vice Chairman Malcolm Hoenlein said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of the rally said more than 700 buses are expected to bring
demonstrators from the East Coast and as far as Wisconsin and Florida.
Others are expected to fly in from the West Coast for the event, which is
being called the National Solidarity Rally for Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Kattler Kupetz, a Los Angeles businesswoman and head of a
literacy program for the Jewish Federation, said she was taking her twin
8-year-old daughters to the rally.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel this is a crisis for Israel," she said. "We are going to
express our solidarity with Israel's right to defend itself against
terrorism just as the U.S. defends itself."</TE>
<TE>   "This is an amazing grass-roots phenomenon," Hyfler said, noting that
the rally was put together in less than a week.</TE>
<TE>   He said the decision to hold the rally was made by Jewish leaders in a
conference call Monday night, with word then spread to local leaders via
telephone and e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   The scheduled speakers for the rally include former Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel. Rally
organizers have also invited congressional leaders to speak.</TE>
<TE>   Hyfler said the rally's organizers wanted to express their
appreciation to Congress for its "unwavering support for Israel."</TE>
<TE>   He insisted that the rally is not intended to send a message to Bush
or to Congress regarding U.S. policy.</TE>

<HD>Outrage Over Traficant, but Not at the Crime</HD>
<DH>Loyalty: In Mahoning Valley, Cleveland-area jurors--outsiders--are
blamed for conviction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>It's Friday morning, the day after their congressman became a
convicted felon, and a steady stream of furious callers are venting to
local radio legend Dan Ryan.</LD>
<LD>   The anger, however, is not directed at Rep. James A. Traficant Jr.,
the Democrat voters here elected nine times to represent this
working-class region in Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The people of the Mahoning Valley are mad at the jurors--10 women and
two men from the Cleveland area, 75 miles to the northwest--who found
Traficant guilty on all 10 counts of a federal indictment that included
charges of bribery, racketeering and taking kickbacks.</LD>
<TE>   A caller tells Ryan--whom Traficant sat in for on WKBN-AM before jury
selection--that the government shouldn't have been wasting its time on
"peanuts" when "trillions" have been stolen from the defense budget.</TE>
<TE>   Another man says that, even if Traficant took bribes--which he didn't
necessarily believe--it wasn't anything that lots of other politicians
weren't doing themselves. Traficant, with his outlandish wardrobe, loud
mouth and self-styled "junkyard dog" persona, just made an easy target.</TE>
<TE>   They like him. They'd vote for him again, even if he has to run from a
prison cell.</TE>
<TE>   "This is utterly insane that people think like this," an exasperated
Ryan said on the air.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the Mahoning Valley, a place known for organized crime,
strong-arm labor tactics and an intense belief that Washington stood by
uncaring as the region lost tens of thousands of good manufacturing jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been something known as the "Youngstown Way," a culture
permeated by ticket-fixing, back-scratching and crooked politicians that
local reformers have been trying to change for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Most people here, even the ones who believe Traficant couldn't be
guiltier, never expected him to go down on all 10 counts. And no one
here, most emphatically Traficant himself, believes that he would have
been found guilty on any charge had Mahoning Valley residents been on the
jury.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant, who represented himself despite lacking a law degree,
complained about the jurors just minutes after the verdict. "Very few
people on this jury really knew Jim Traficant or had an understanding of
Jim Traficant," he said. "I think that would have made a big difference."</TE>
<TE>   After all, when he represented himself in 1983 at the same Cleveland
courthouse, a jury that included six people from the Mahoning Valley
acquitted him on federal charges of taking $163,000 from organized crime.
Traficant, then the elected sheriff, convinced jurors that the money,
which he was caught taking on tape, was part of his own undercover sting.</TE>
<TE>   He tried unsuccessfully to have his latest trial reassigned to the
federal courthouse in Youngstown, because valley residents no longer are
part of the jury pool in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   At the Classic Cafe in Washingtonville, near the farm where Traficant
used congressional staffers to shovel manure on government time, Tari
Altenburg said Saturday that those who live elsewhere should not have sat
in judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant, who once regularly earned more than 90% of the vote in his
district, has served as a thumb in the government's eye for local
residents. They say he has been effective for the region. His support has
ebbed, but even after he warned voters in 2000 that he would soon be
indicted, Traficant was reelected with about 49% of the vote, more than
twice that of his nearest opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Though his district has been reconfigured, the consensus was that he
could win again if he had beaten the indictment. Now, Democratic Party
leaders are calling for his resignation, and he faces expulsion from the
House if he does not step down. Traficant has vowed to run again as an
independent.</TE>
<TE>   "We know him, everyone here likes him, everyone here would vote for
him again," said Altenburg, who served the congressman a breakfast of
eggs and tomatoes Friday morning. "They didn't even know him up there.
That's not a jury of his peers. His peers are here. The construction
workers and the road crews--those are his peers."</TE>
<TE>   At the Hub, a Youngstown diner frequented by the mayor, police chief
and other elected officials in this small city's fading downtown, Domenic
Paolone Jr. said the verdict made him "sick to his stomach."</TE>
<TE>   "They made him out like he's shaking people down and that's not it at
all," said Paolone, who testified for Traficant at the trial. "He does
things for people that are nice and then they want to throw him a little
something. People here would've understood that."</TE>
<TE>   Nabeel Kandah, who runs the restaurant, also still believes in
Traficant. "Look, if the whole town is corrupt, then that's what you've
got to work with," Kandah said.</TE>
<TE>   The town's pervasive corruption got the whole investigation going in
the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Smoking a cigar on a street corner across from the Mahoning County
Courthouse, where he has been the prosecutor for six years, Paul Gains
believes he can pinpoint the moment that Traficant's downfall began.</TE>
<TE>   "It all started when I got shot," he said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Gains, then prosecutor-elect, was the target of an assassination
attempt in his home on Christmas Eve 1996--shot three times and left for
dead after the mob hit man's gun jammed. He had defeated a sitting
prosecutor with ties to the region's well-documented organized crime
syndicate, and had vowed to end the culture of fixing cases.</TE>
<TE>   Though there was little public outrage at the time of the shooting, it
proved to be the catalyst for a public corruption probe that now has seen
more than 70 valley residents convicted, including the former prosecutor,
a county sheriff and prominent business officials.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant is the biggest to fall.</TE>
<TE>   James Callen, who 19 years ago started the Citizen's League of
Youngstown to fight corruption, said the job isn't over. Others who have
worked alongside him for years say even members of their own families
were hoping Traficant would get off.</TE>
<TE>   Callen said the region suffers from the impression that business gets
done the same way everywhere else, that if prosecutors looked hard at any

<HD>Gore's Jabs at Bush Punch Up Fla. Party</HD>
<DH>Convention: His speech could help restore the former vice
president's standing as a leading voice among Democrats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>An animated Al Gore delivered a comprehensive indictment of
President Bush's domestic record Saturday, returning to the political
arena with a campaign-style speech that roused a crowd of Florida
Democrats.</LD>
<LD>   In his most pointed remarks since conceding the 2000 election to Bush,
Gore denounced the administration's record on issues from the economy and
education to the environment and the federal budget. While praising
Bush's handling of the war against terrorism, Gore insisted that the
issue shouldn't inhibit Democrats from delineating differences with the
president on other issues.</LD>
<LD>   "The time has come for us . . . to offer constructive alternatives
when we believe what they're doing is wrong for America," Gore said. "And
a lot of what they are doing, I believe, is wrong for America."</LD>
<TE>   Gore's remarks drew an enthusiastic response from about 2,500
delegates at the state Democratic Party convention in Florida, site of
the 2000 election's controversial end. He was interrupted with standing
ovations several times, and afterward many convention delegates were
effusive with praise.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was the best speech he ever gave," said Dennis Tuck, a
retired test pilot from Dunedin, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the speech was among the most systematic critiques of Bush's
performance by any prominent Democrat and could help Gore restore his
eroded standing as a leading voice in the party. Many in the audience
viewed it as an indication--like his recent decision to shave his
beard--that Gore was ending his self-imposed exile from political debate.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like he was ready to take them all on again," said Doug
Courtney, a state Democratic committee member from Palm Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the sense of a homecoming, Gore even embraced former
President Clinton, applauding the economic record that many Democrats
felt Gore had failed to highlight sufficiently in the 2000 presidential
campaign. "I don't care what anybody says: I think Bill Clinton and I did
a . . . good job," Gore said.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran GOP operative Rich Galen, attending the gathering for the
Florida Republican Party, said the speech was "as good as Gore can do,"
but questioned whether such a sharp partisan message will be attractive
to most Americans at a time when Bush is so popular.</TE>
<TE>   "If he takes this speech to Missouri, I'm not sure it works as well,"
Galen said.</TE>
<TE>   The event marked the first time Gore has shared a stage with other
Democrats who are considering a bid for the party's 2004 presidential
nomination. Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, who is actively
exploring a candidacy, also received a warm, though considerably less
emotional, reception for his folksy, populist speech Saturday morning.
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, who hasn't actively explored a
campaign but hasn't closed the door to it, also spoke.</TE>
<TE>   The convention is scheduled to hear today from two other potential
candidates: Sens. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and Joseph I. Lieberman
of Connecticut, Gore's running mate in 2000. Lieberman, who met with Gore
over breakfast Saturday morning, has said he won't run if Gore does.</TE>
<TE>   Gore has given no indication whether he will seek the nomination for a
rematch against Bush. But after months of Gore maintaining a resolutely
low profile, Saturday's sharply worded speech was the best indication yet
that he is keeping his options open.</TE>
<TE>   The event had all the feel of a campaign appearance. While Edwards,
for instance, merely stepped onstage after an introduction, Gore pushed
through the crowd to the pounding beat of a U2 rock anthem. Many in the
crowd waved signs, which Gore's advisors insisted they had not printed,
declaring that Florida was "Still Gore country," and chanted "Gore in 4."</TE>
<TE>   As he often did during the 2000 campaign, Gore removed his coat and
spoke in shirt sleeves. On several occasions, he gently poked fun at
himself--declaring at one point that he was concerned about the economic
slowdown because "I was the first one laid off a year ago." And he served
up the high-voltage partisan rhetoric that he has almost entirely avoided
since 2000--to the consternation of some party leaders who believe Gore
remained above the fray for too long.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Gore mentioned Bush by name sparingly. But he
relentlessly criticized the administration's performance on most of the
key issues that divided him and Bush during their bitterly fought
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "America's economy is suffering unnecessarily," Gore charged.
"Important American values are being trampled. Special interests are
calling the shots."</TE>
<TE>   Gore accused Bush of "loosening environmental safeguards to satisfy
the polluters," failing to fully fund the education reforms the
administration steered through Congress last year and offering an
insufficient plan to provide prescription drugs for senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Gore's sharpest barbs were aimed at Bush's handling of the
federal budget. Gore charged that Bush's tax cut has squandered trillions
of dollars in anticipated surpluses and has forced the administration to
divert $1.8 trillion in Social Security surpluses over the next decade to
operate the rest of government. As Gore archly noted, during the campaign
Bush had echoed Gore's promise to set aside those surpluses in a
"lockbox" to pay down the national debt.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't say I told you so," Gore said to laughter from the crowd.
"But if anyone is in the market for a 'never-been-used' lockbox, see me
afterward."</TE>
<TE>   The administration has argued that the economic slowdown and the cost
of the war against terrorism, not the tax cut, have been the principal
factors in erasing the federal budget surplus.</TE>
<TE>   Gore's appearance came at a time when many party insiders have been
expressing skepticism about whether he should seek the Democratic
presidential nomination for 2004. Late last week, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup
Poll found that a plurality of Democrats now say they prefer Gore not run
again.</TE>
<TE>   Before the speech, even delegates here appeared ambivalent about the
prospect of a Gore redux. Afterward, many expressed more enthusiasm,
though some still were uncertain whether the party should seek out a
fresh face. "I'm not sure whether I want what's been there, or something
new and different," said Laura Atkinson of Ponte Vedra Beach.</TE>
<TE>   What's clear after Saturday is that Gore intends to give Democrats at
least the opportunity to consider "what's been there," as he returns to a
more visible role in the partisan debates.</TE>

<DH>Art: The Mormon culture encourages musicianship, so pianos are big
business in Utah.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>In a state where taking piano is as much a part of growing up as
riding a bike, the Brown family has struck a bold new chord.</LD>
<LD>   The four oldest Brown children study piano at New York's highly
competitive Juilliard School of Music. The youngest, 16-year-old Ryan,
practices 25 hours a week at the family home in rural Alpine, hops a
Friday-night red-eye to New York for pre-college classes at Juilliard,
and then shuttles back to Utah in time for church on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   While the Brown epic is the stuff of headlines and guest spots on
"Oprah," it underscores a more widespread point of local pride: When it
comes to piano, other states are playing "Chopsticks" while Utah is
performing Rachmaninoff. For reasons rooted in Mormon culture, residents
have turned Utah into a piano peddler paradise.</LD>
<TE>   Daynes Music, the state's oldest retail business, sold its first piano
in 1862, just 15 years after Brigham Young's band of pioneers set foot in
the Salt Lake Valley. While it's not much bigger than Oxnard, Salt Lake
City hosts the renowned Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition,
which this year drew 520 applicants from 40 countries. State officials
even brag about Utah's top standing in a statistical category so obscure
that other states somehow fail to mention it: Pianos per capita.</TE>
<TE>   Trade organizations like the Dallas-based Piano Manufacturers Assn.
International back up the boast. According to the group, some 1,800 new
pianos were sold in the Salt Lake City area in 2000--second only to 1,900
in Chicago, a metropolitan region with four times the population of all
of Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Utahans buy pianos at roughly five times the national rate, according
to Bob Jones, vice president and general manager of Samick Music, one of
the world's largest piano manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a blueprint for what we wish every market in America would look
like," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Piano Gallery, one of the area's largest dealers, offers private
teachers use of a free 200-seat recital hall for student performances.
"It's booked up for a year and a half," general manager Joe Toscano said.</TE>
<TE>   At programs in schools, Brigham Young University music professor Paul
Pollei breaks the ice by asking the children who have taken piano lessons
to raise their hands.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable--all of them go up!" said Pollei, who directs the
Bachauer competition. "We have a saying here: You can't be born in Utah
unless you play the piano."</TE>
<TE>   Historians trace Utah's zeal for music to its Mormon roots. Joseph
Smith, the religion's founder, established a singing school when the
Mormons were a persecuted sect in Nauvoo, Ill. Mormon pioneers from
Europe brought their music with them; chroniclers of their trek across
the Plains write of hearing the strains of Mendelsohn wafting from Mormon
camps.</TE>
<TE>   Brigham Young required every group setting out for new territory from
Salt Lake to include a fiddler or a singer, said Jerold Ottley, a retired
conductor of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important that the people have music," Ottley said. "It was
one of the great salves."</TE>
<TE>   In Mormon congregations, unpaid members lead worship services and
provide the music.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes parents want to prepare the children to take over these
responsibilities," Ottley said. "It's one of the great impetuses to
having a piano."</TE>
<TE>   Like many other Mormon parents, Keith and Lisa Brown view music as a
vital part of family life, and gave their children instruction with hopes
that they would play at church.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much music in the church, from the Tabernacle Choir on
down," said Keith Brown, a financial officer for a law firm. "You play
for funerals, for weddings, for church services. You play just to help
out."</TE>
<TE>   Home-schooled, all the Brown children started piano at age 3. As they
grew, they practiced as long as seven hours daily, studying first with
their mother, who has a degree in voice, and then with university-level
piano teachers.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, the two oldest girls--Desirae, now 23, and Deondra,
22--were accepted at Juilliard, which takes only about 1 in 10 of the
aspiring musicians who apply. The next year, Gregory, 19, and Melody, 18,
had successful auditions, and Ryan was accepted for the pre-college
program. He plans to apply to the college program next year. Meanwhile,
he continues his weekly treks to Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   To keep the family together, Keith and Lisa Brown left Alpine, 35
miles south of Salt Lake, in 1998 and rented a house in suburban
Hartsdale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for anything that would fit five pianos and seven
people, that was close to a train station, that was within an hour's
commute of the city, and that wouldn't break the bank," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with financial aid, the dizzying costs forced the couple and
their youngest son back to Utah last year. But Keith Brown insists that
the sacrifices have been worthwhile, despite the odds against his
children making a living as concert performers.</TE>
<TE>   "What parents wouldn't bankrupt themselves to have all their kids
doing what they love and progressing in one of the world's top schools?"
he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Like their father, the Brown children make their family's saga sound
almost natural.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like you've been doing it so long it just becomes part
of you," said Deondra Brown, taking a break from Brahms' "Variations on a
Theme of Haydn." "Most people might think we're kind of odd or that we
were pushed by our parents but when they get to know us, that's just
blown out of the water. We're just happy people; it's in our genes."</TE>
<TE>   Deondra and her sister Desirae study together, playing pieces for four
hands. If performing doesn't work out, they figure they can fall back on
their Juilliard master's degrees to pick up teaching jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Three other Utah students are among the 113 studying piano at
Juilliard--all the more impressive, school officials say, since nearly
half the students come from abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Utah, the piano is often a centerpiece for Mormon "family home
evenings," weekly nights of old-fashioned togetherness.</TE>
<TE>   "We usually open ours with a prayer and a song," said high school
student Grant Anderson. "Sometimes we'll play games or bake cookies, but
we'll almost always sing around the piano."</TE>
<TE>   When the Brown kids are home, the house in Alpine booms with laughter,
classical chords and the bemused observations of a father who still can't
quite believe his ears.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't plan this," Keith Brown said of his musical clan. "We
thought that one, maybe two would stick with it."</TE>

<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The IRS is going to get tough this year, we're told. Brighten
up--that's the good news. There's much worse to contemplate this tax
season.</LD>
<LD>   Our tax codes are too complicated. Not just by a little, but
shockingly so. They invite manipulation and grandiose abuse. Public
support for honesty in taxes--the "price we pay for a civilized
society," as Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. famously put it--is eroding.</LD>
<LD>   Ho hum. Are we surprised? Hardly. Insofar as I know, there isn't a
single person in the land who believes our tax system is fair or even
remotely close to it.</LD>
<TE>   Section 8 of the Constitution says this: "The Congress shall have
the power to lay and collect taxes." The 16th Amendment goes further:
"The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on
incomes from whatever source derived."</TE>
<TE>   In 1913, the first federal income tax form was three pages long.
Instructions were a single page. The following year, Congress heard
the first call for tax simplification--and, of course, ignored it.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone knows the rest: Special interests have been loading up
the tax codes with juicy loopholes ever since. Congress has spent 88
years trying to punish and reward behavior with tax breaks. And, all
the while, the government has been chasing corner-cutters and cheats
not with common sense, but with mountainous regulation.</TE>
<TE>   The result? Enron reportedly paid no taxes for four of the last
five years, deploying assets to more than 800 offshore subsidiaries,
including 692 in the tax haven of the Cayman Islands. The true extent
of this dodge has not been disclosed, except for sleight of hand like
this: Using deductions for stock options, the company turned a
$112-million tax liability into a $278-million refund.</TE>
<TE>   A book documenting widespread tax evasion, "The Cheating of
America," reports that Enron is just one of thousands of corporations
with assets over $250 million that claimed no taxable income in 1995.
Among individuals in 1996, 16,000 of the richest Americans paid an
effective tax rate under 10%, far lower than the burden on
middle-class families. The richest 1% of taxpayers accounted for 15%
of itemized deductions.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the rub: What they don't pay, we make up for--$30.76 every
week from every honest taxpayer--$195 billion total.</TE>
<TE>   The "why" is simple: Taxes have become a sucker game for salary
workers. The "how" is equally straightforward: Tax laws are a crime.</TE>
<TE>   How bloated is the income tax code? To equal it in words, you'd
have to clip this twice-a-week column until 2014. To match the number
of words in the tax regulations, you'd be clipping until 2090.</TE>
<TE>   Take just one question: Do you have a child? The IRS devotes 200
pages of regulation to help you close in on the answer, according to
the agency's taxpayer advocate, Nina Olson.</TE>
<TE>   Recent court cases have shown that the business tax laws are so
shot with loopholes that respected corporations think nothing of
flagrant financial manipulation, eu- phemistically called "earnings
management," betting the odds that judges will uphold their actions
as legal and that Wall Street will reward their ingenuity. As I said,
paying taxes is for saps.</TE>
<TE>   Regrettably, calls to simplify the tax system seem to have reached
a modern low. Americans are exhausted, numb. We cannot decipher our
telephone bills anymore, let alone the tax law. Politicians, always
eager to trade loopholes for contributions, regard this silence as
acquiescence. President Bush's supposedly straightforward tax-rate
cuts actually resulted in 440 changes in the IRS codes.</TE>
<TE>   The cost: A nonprofit research organization, the Tax Foundation,
has calculated that Americans pay a 20-cent "tax compliance
surcharge" for every $1 collected. That's what businesses,
individuals and organizations pay to meet (or try to escape) their
tax obligations. No wonder that in a recent poll, 24% of the country
said it was OK to cheat on taxes--a leap upward from 13% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS, defanged and diminished for years now, promises that it
is going to rouse itself finally. It has announced an investigation
of up to 2 million individual taxpayers who may be using offshore
trusts and accounts to evade taxes, accessing their money with credit
cards. And it promises nearly 50,000 new random audits.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe this new get-tough attitude will actually snare a grubby
millionaire tax cheat here or there. It's not much, but it's the best
we can hope for this April.</TE>

<HD>Put Some Bite Into a 'Land for Peace' Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSSELL KOROBKIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Violence continues to escalate in the Middle East despite the fact
that the contours of a mutually beneficial deal seem obvious to many:
Israel withdraws from most of the occupied territories and allows the
Palestinians to establish a sovereign state. In return, the
Palestinians give Israel peace.</LD>
<LD>   This deal would not be perfect for either side, but it seems far
better for both than ongoing misery and loss of life. Why is the
bargain not struck?</LD>
<LD>   A number of reasons have been suggested: centuries-old tribal
hatreds, religious fervor, personal vendettas and Yasser Arafat's
rejection of the offer by former Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Camp
David.</LD>
<TE>   All these factors are relevant, but the most significant roadblock
to peace is the structure of the imagined treaty. Land and peace
cannot be exchanged simultaneously. Israel would have to provide the
land first and rely on the Palestinians to provide peace in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that Israel does not trust the Palestinians to live
up to their end of the bargain. Many Palestinians want not just the
occupied territories but also the entire state of Israel. So after
their state is established, why would Palestinians not continue
terrorist attacks? Arafat's current claim that he cannot control the
suicide bombers only underscores the fact that the Palestinians
cannot guarantee future peace. Even if peace were to precede the
transfer of territory--long an Israeli demand--Israel must be able to
expect continued peace.</TE>
<TE>   The problem of nonsimultaneous performance is common in bargaining
contexts. Why would I pay you today for goods to be delivered later
when you might decide to keep my money and either never provide the
goods or provide shoddy goods?</TE>
<TE>   Two types of solutions can make such bargains possible. First, an
external enforcement mechanism such as a judicial system can
guarantee to the first party the performance of the second party.
Second, the agreement itself can provide a mechanism for the first
party to recoup its losses if the second party fails to perform, both
to protect the first party and provide incentives to the second.</TE>
<TE>   Many commentators have essentially called for the development of
an external enforcement mechanism by suggesting that U.S. or other
outside peacekeeping forces go to the region. The problem with this
approach--besides Western reluctance--is that neutral soldiers cannot
prevent Palestinian suicide bombings any better than Israeli soldiers
can.</TE>
<TE>   A better approach is to build into the agreement a provision that
permits Israel to reoccupy portions of the territories if the
Palestinians fail to provide the peace they promise, with higher
levels of terror triggering the right of Israel to reoccupy larger
portions of land. This approach would give Israel the security to
sacrifice land and the Palestinians the strongest possible incentive
to prevent future terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, disputes could arise. Israel might blame the Palestinians for
an act of terrorism, while the Palestinians claim the attack was
launched from elsewhere, such as Lebanon. To deal with such disputes,
the treaty would have to establish a neutral international
arbitration panel to quickly resolve disagreements.</TE>
<TE>   To make "land for peace" safe for Israel, the Palestinians and the
international community would have to recognize that an Israeli
reoccupation under the conditions of continued terror would be
justified. The Palestinians would do so by accepting such a provision
in the treaty; the world community could do so by enacting a United
Nations resolution in support.</TE>
<TE>   To convince Israel to cede land, the Palestinians must guarantee
peace. The best way to do this is to make the continued existence of
a new Palestinian state dependent on it.</TE>

<HD>Ellison's 'Invisible' Still Walk Among Us</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LUCAS MOREL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I am an invisible man." So begins the most important book on
American race relations since "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Ralph Ellison's
"Invisible Man," published 50 years ago today, portrays an unnamed
black character as he struggles to make a name for himself in an
America that refuses to "see" him. "When they approach me they see
only my surroundings, themselves or figments of their
imagination--indeed, everything and anything except me."</LD>
<LD>   Today, an important task of American politics is to make room for
black Americans to be "seen" and judged as individuals. With April
marking 10 years since riots broke out in Los Angeles after four
police officers were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King, we
would do well to consider what remains to be done politically and
socially to bridge the increasing racial divide in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Ellison emphatically denied that black Americans were merely the
sum total of their experiences with slavery and segregation.
Constrained by racial prejudice in law and custom, they also were
participants in what Ellison called a "broader American cultural
freedom" that reposed a responsibility in each citizen to think and
act.</LD>
<TE>   "But what kind of society," the invisible man asks, "would make
him see me?"</TE>
<TE>   The tragic irony for black Americans is that they suffer from both
visibility and invisibility. Their "high visibility" as blacks living
in a predominantly white society makes them the legal and social
target of racism, while their individuality remains invisible to a
white society that judges them only by their color.</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, Ellison testified at a Senate hearing on U.S. cities.
Instead of the government treating black Americans "as though we are
being legislated for rather than with," Ellison suggested that laws
"should grant to each Negro his individuality." This would help the
diverse individuals within the U.S. "know one another without the
myths of racial inferiority or superiority."</TE>
<TE>   This also created "a fair field of testing." As Ellison said, "I
don't expect any special provisions to be made for me because I'm a
Negro." No literary condescension; no legal condescension.</TE>
<TE>   In this he channeled the muse of Frederick Douglass, who believed
that the so-called "Negro problem" would disappear as soon as the
government stopped treating black Americans differently from white
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   When Ellison received the National Book Award for "Invisible Man,"
he said that he modeled his effort after an earlier generation of
American writers who "took a much greater responsibility for the
condition of democracy." Like Melville and Twain, Ellison wrote as an
appreciative critic of his country, and thereby cultivated what he
called "articulate citizens"--those who would go on to lead the
nation in bringing its practice more in line with its principles.</TE>
<TE>   But Ellison's fame drew the ire of black nationalists during the
1960s. As a black writer, he was expected to "fight the power," not
preach the glories of the Declaration of Independence. Ellison's
devotion to the Constitution as "the still-vital covenant by which
Americans of diverse backgrounds, religions, races and interests are
bound" was too much for those seeking to profit by the confusion of
the post-civil rights era.</TE>
<TE>   No one was more mindful than Ellison that diversity, in and of
itself, does not automatically produce unity. According to the
invisible man, "It's 'winner take nothing' that is the great truth of
our country or of any country."</TE>
<TE>   As a minority of one, "Invisible Man's" narrator offers an ode to
the national motto, E pluribus unum: "America is woven of many
strands; I would recognize them and let it so remain."</TE>
<TE>   He touts the diversity of each individual and not the mayhem of
multiculturalism that has balkanized college campuses and entrenched
a system of color-coded benefits and burdens. "Let man keep his many
parts," the invisible man suggests, "and you'll have no tyrant
states."</TE>
<TE>   Although Ellison only published one novel during his life, the
lesson taught by his invisible man is as valid today--that the
government of all must be partial to none. Even more important, as
Ellison put it, "the obligation of making oneself seen and heard [is]
an imperative of American democratic individualism."</TE>

<HD>L.A.'s Next Chief Should Listen to What the Community Wants</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Commission has a few days before it begins the
formal process of hiring someone to replace Chief Bernard Parks.
During that interval it might be useful for the commissioners to
leave the politically charged atmosphere of City Hall and the
neighboring LAPD headquarters and spend time in this city's
high-crime neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   The effects of their choice to replace Parks will be felt most
profoundly in such neighborhoods--places like Boyle Heights on the
mostly Latino Eastside, patrolled by officers from the LAPD's
Hollenbeck Division.</LD>
<LD>   The history of relations between the Los Angeles Police Department
and Latino L.A. has been decidedly mixed. All too often it has been
marked by bitter incidents--from the Zoot Suit riots of 1943 through
the Rampart scandal of 1998.</LD>
<TE>   What makes this sadly ironic is that Latinos are generally
pro-police. They are born into a conservative culture that respects
authority and they often live in high-crime areas where it's good to
have cops around. That's why so many Latino youngsters aspire to law
enforcement careers.</TE>
<TE>   Smart police leaders--and Hollenbeck Division has been blessed
with a few--try to tap into this reservoir of pro-police sentiment.
But Parks hasn't done enough of that, as was illustrated by a
little-noted flap in January.</TE>
<TE>   That was when members of Hollenbeck's community police advisory
board made an eminently reasonable but politically provocative
request of the Police Commission: Have the L.A. County Sheriff's
Department help the LAPD in Boyle Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Residents were concerned because a surge in gang crime and drug
dealing had led to a perceived increase in homicides in Hollenbeck
Division--38 deaths in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   During the same period, sheriff's deputies in East Los Angeles, in
the same part of town but just across Indiana Avenue (the city-county
border), were reporting the lowest homicide rate there in 30
years--five deaths in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, folks in Boyle Heights pondered this contrast
and started asking questions. And the answers they got, while
reasonable, were unsatisfactory.</TE>
<TE>   "They told us they needed more manpower," according to Mary Lou
Trevis, a member of the community advisory group.</TE>
<TE>   The combined effect of declining recruitment, defections to other
police agencies and the redeployment of officers after Sept. 11 left
Boyle Heights underpoliced, even as sheriff's deputies in East L.A.
were implementing community policing programs.</TE>
<TE>   This led to another reasonable question: "Why can't we do what our
neighbors are doing?" Trevis says. So Trevis did some research and
discovered that it was not unusual for local police departments to
ask the Sheriff's Department for aid when their jurisdictions are
understaffed. Although the Boyle Heights residents got a sympathetic
hearing on the idea from the Police Commission, they were not able to
get Parks' support. County Supervisor Gloria Molina also helped
squelch the plan, insisting that deputies in East L.A. had enough
work.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we might not get what we wanted, but at least we got
their attention" says Ross Valencia, a Boyle Heights resident who
also sits on the Hollenbeck advisory board.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, more narcotics detectives have been assigned to duty in
Hollenbeck Division, and residents hope that will have some effect on
their spiraling crime rate. But they remain skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem hasn't gone away," says Msgr. John Moretta, pastor of
a large Catholic parish in the area and also an advisory board
member. "We've had 17 homicides since the start of this year--171/2
if you count one poor kid who's brain dead."</TE>
<TE>   I know enough about how squishy statistics can be, especially
crime statistics, to not attempt to use the homicide numbers on the
Eastside to prove anything. Least of all that deputies in East L.A.
are doing a better job than the hard-working officers in Hollenbeck
Division. In fact, LAPD has statistics that indicate, despite the
perception in Boyle Heights that crime is up, that 38 homicides
annually has been the average number in Hollenbeck for the last five
years.</TE>
<TE>   But those numbers, and the Boyle Heights community's reaction to
them, illustrate a creative challenge to whoever succeeds Parks as
head of the LAPD: how to channel the energy of the many law-abiding
residents of Boyle Heights into a real community policing program.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to work with our Police Department as a team" is how
Trevis puts it.</TE>
<TE>   Such grass-roots support should not be frittered away. And anyone
who presumes to lead the LAPD must commit to using it as
enthusiastically and creatively as possible. Not just in Boyle
Heights but in every part of Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>A 'Guys and Dolls' Just Like Harlem</HD>
<DH>To Maurice Hines, the star of a touring revival, that means
a diverse cast reflecting the kind of world he grew up in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>If you're going to do a show about gamblers leading the sportin' life
in Manhattan in the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Hines says,
getting it right means going for racial diversity.</LD>
<LD>   In 1950, the all-white original cast of "Guys and Dolls" sent
audiences home humming "Luck Be a Lady," "Sue Me," "I've Never Been
in Love Before" and other Frank Loesser gems. In 1976, Hines starred
in a touring revival as Nathan Detroit, proprietor of "the oldest
established permanent floating crap game in New York." That "Guys and
Dolls" had an all-black cast that also featured Debbie Allen, Leslie
Uggams and Richard Roundtree.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest major production, launched at the Arena Stage in
Washington, D.C., in 1999 and opening Wednesday at the Wilshire
Theatre in Beverly Hills, Hines is Nathan once again. But the world
in which he moves is populated this time by blacks and whites.</LD>
<TE>   That, says Hines, reflects what he saw as a kid growing up in
Harlem. Two of his mother's brothers were gamblers, flashy dressers
who fancied themselves Cab Calloway-style bon vivants. He remembers
running around his grandmother's house with his younger brother,
Gregory, while the card and dice games were in session. By the time
they were 10 and 8, respectively, Maurice and Gregory had made their
Broadway debuts in a short-lived 1954 musical called "The Girl in
Pink Tights."</TE>
<TE>   "My uncles had friends who were white, Asian, black, Hispanic.
They all had one thing in common--they were gamblers," Maurice Hines
said. "All-white company of 'Guys and Dolls' in 1950? Wrong!
All-black company in the 1970s? Wrong! If you celebrate New York, you
celebrate all cultures. That's why I think the world should see this
show."</TE>
<TE>   Hines was holding forth in the lobby of a San Diego hotel, where
he had settled in for a long round of interviews to drum up interest
in the Southern California leg of the "Guys and Dolls" tour. Tall,
slender, and clad on this day in black leather and black denim, Hines
prides himself on playing Nathan larger than life.</TE>
<TE>   When he was small, Hines was quiet and withdrawn--so much so that
when someone from a local dance studio came knocking door to door one
day with an offer of free lessons, his uncle urged his mother to send
the boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Uncle Li said, 'He'll meet kids; maybe he'll talk more,'" Hines
said. The dance floor brought out a spinning dervish. Maurice taught
Gregory what he learned, and soon a family act was born that would
continue into the early 1970s--with father Maurice Sr. joining in on
drums starting in the 1960s, prompting a change in billing to Hines,
Hines and Dad. Maurice's first turn as Nathan Detroit came after
Gregory left the act and began the solo career that extending from
the stage to film and television, has made him the more famous
brother.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Hines says he patterned his first turn as Nathan after
another of his mother's brothers--Uncle Sid, "the jokester of the
family."</TE>
<TE>   When his old friend, writer-director Charles Randolph-Wright, was
tapped by the Arena Stage to direct a revival of "Guys and Dolls,"
Hines got his latest chance. This time he is using his Uncle Doc, a
suave ladies' man, as his model.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to play him more charming, and my Uncle Doc was a
charmer. When he died, five of his mistresses came [to the funeral].
They all knew each other, and they didn't care he was dating the
others. He was really the ultimate."</TE>
<TE>   Wright, who is black, said that when agents found out that he and
Hines were anchoring the project, they automatically began to offer
their black clients as prospects. But one of the concepts for this
show from the beginning was to have no color barriers. Another was to
make it fast-paced, with lots of dancing, using Hines' energy and
footwork as a keynote.</TE>
<TE>   In "Guys and Dolls," which is based on stories by Damon Runyan,
the out-of-town gambler Sky Masterson is the man with the biggest
musical moments. But Wright wanted to establish Nathan Detroit as the
play's dominant force.</TE>
<TE>   For Adelaide, the showgirl who, to her great frustration, has been
strung along by Nathan for 14 years, Wright says he wound up with
five strong finalists, "each one a different color." The part went to
the Haitian-born Alexandra Foucard, whom the director felt could best
match Hines' "energy and fire." On Dec. 30, 1999, the day Hines was
to open "Guys and Dolls" in Washington, his 82-year-old mother, Alma,
was on her deathbed in a Las Vegas hospice. He called her, saying he
would postpone the show and be with her by the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'Oh, no-no-no-no-no. I trained my boys to be on stage,
and that's the way I want to think of you.' I did my performance and
waited to get the call, and Gregory called me after the opening and
told me she had died."</TE>
<TE>   Hines doesn't like to talk about his relationship with his
brother, saying it's none of the public's business.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory is more open about their ups and downs. The two last
performed together--playing a brother act going through a breakup--in
the 1984 film "The Cotton Club."</TE>
<TE>   "We were in and out; it was a stormy relationship," Gregory Hines
said in a telephone interview. But during the past five years, he
said, with their mother's failing health as a prod, the rifts have
healed.</TE>
<TE>   "My brother and I were struggling, but now we've seen the beauty
and love that can happen after it's worked past," Gregory said,
adding that he and their 79-year-old father expect to be at the Los
Angeles opening.</TE>
<TE>   Some reviewers have qualified their praise for Maurice Hines'
Nathan, seeing the performance as a bit over-the-top. But others have
raved, and there is a critical consensus that his vibrancy ignites
the production. Jo Sullivan Loesser, the songwriter's widow, applauds
his approach: "He's quite sexy on the stage. He loves the part so
much, and you can see it."</TE>
<TE>   Hines sees his success with "Guys and Dolls" not as a springboard
to more big roles, but as a farewell to stage acting. What drives him
now, he says, is a desire to be a choreographer-director.</TE>
<TE>   He already has several projects in the works, including "Yo,
Alice!," a hip-hop adaptation of "Alice in Wonderland"; "Hott Feett,"
a Latin-dance reworking of the Hans Christian Andersen fable "The Red
Shoes"; and a musical based on the life of Ella Fitzgerald. He also
plans to record an up-tempo jazz vocal CD this year, the sequel to
"I've Never Been in Love Before," his 2000 debut release of romantic
ballads.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't need to be on stage," Hines says. "When I'm in a room
full of dancers, I'm in heaven. I've [performed] since I was 5 years
old; now I'll do choreography. That's what I really love."</TE>
<TE>   Hines says that being a choreographer, like being Nathan Detroit,
places him in a world that needs a good racial mix. He thinks
Broadway has given black choreographers token opportunities rather
than full inclusion. "Otherwise you wouldn't have just one African
American choreographer represented on all of Broadway. Garth Fagan.
'The Lion King' ... I'm very volatile about this, because I feel
Broadway is racist and they should be embarrassed for it."</TE>
<TE>   Hines has been on tour with "Guys and Dolls" since last August,
performing eight shows a week. His brother thinks the wear and tear
of that regimen may have something to do with him proclaiming his
farewell as a stage actor and dancer.</TE>
<TE>   "He's said that to me on a few occasions, but I don't believe it,"
Gregory Hines said. "Maybe there's a side of him that feels, 'This is
it, never again,' but in Maurice's deepest heart of hearts there
lives a performer. He's got so many behind-the-scenes skills, but
when the lights go to half and Maurice is sitting in the audience,
there will be a little pang in him where he could feel, 'I miss it
and I want to do it.'"</TE>

<LD>Why we still care: It's been five years since the Prodigy's "Fat of
the Land" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart, and no other
electronic act has been able to duplicate that feat since. Two
singles, the controversial "Smack My Bitch Up" and the dynamic
"Firestarter," have kept the band alive in both the dance and
mainstream scenes.</LD>
<LD>   The return: After that long layoff, the Prodigy is planning its
return to the United States, kicking into high gear with a headlining
appearance at the Coachella Festival in Indio on April 28. "Coachella
and the vibe of the festival seemed right for us," says leader Liam
Howlett. "It's not just a rock festival or a dance thing. It has a
real alternative feel." Coachella (and a preceding Las Vegas gig)
will be followed by a new single, "Baby's Got a Temper," in July, and
the long-awaited new album, "Always Outnumbered, Always Outgained,"
before the end of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Sneak preview: Howlett promises that fans who trek to Coachella
will be rewarded with a preview of several new songs, including the
single. "Some of the songs are written in typical Prodigy style, just
to rock live," Howlett says.</LD>
<TE>   Where they've been: The temptation is, of course, to ask what
Howlett and the rest of the Prodigy have been up to since getting off
the road three years ago, but the question would be futile, he warns.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone said, 'What have you been doing the last three years?'
I couldn't tell you. The members of this band are so oblivious to any
kind of time that it feels literally like we've just come off the
tour of 'Fat of the Land.'"</TE>
<TE>   How they fit in today: "I'm not really into much of this kind of
metal stuff," Howlett says. "It's all nonsense really, but our
nonsense makes more sense."</TE>

<HD>Wilco's Not Over or Out</HD>
<DH>Reprise Records was decidedly cool to the acclaimed band's
unusual new album, and the result was a split. Now things are looking
up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Tweedy is standing outside a small studio at radio station
KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, waiting to lead his band Wilco through its
paces, when somebody waves what might be a red flag in front of
him--a newspaper article on Ryan Adams.</LD>
<LD>   Will this reminder of his presumed rival's celebrity plunge Tweedy
into a spell of his famous melancholy? The singer just glances at the
page and flashes a half-smile.</LD>
<LD>   "It's funny," he says. "We have the same lawyer in New York, and I
went into his office and saw this picture on his wall. I said 'Hey, I
don't remember doing that show.'"</LD>
<TE>   Tweedy can afford to joke about the rivalry that isn't. For one
thing, Wilco's music has roamed to a place far from Adams' turf--the
folk-based, roots-conscious alt-country that Tweedy helped plant in
the pop landscape in the late '80s. For another, his band's rocky
path over the past year has looked to be the dead opposite of Adams'
smooth sailing.</TE>
<TE>   Artistically, things are fine. Wilco's "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" was
even cited by some critics as one of the best albums of 2001. The
trouble was, it didn't come out in 2001. It was scheduled to be
released last September by Reprise Records, the group's home for six
years. But then the label got a listen to the evocative but
off-center mix of folk, pop, ambient and abstract elements that Wilco
had cooked up in its Chicago studio.</TE>
<TE>   "They said that they didn't like it, it's career-ending, if we
really thought that was a record that could be released then we
should consider going somewhere else," Tweedy recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Wilco did go somewhere else--to Nonesuch Records, a cutting-edge
classical label (Philip Glass, Kronos Quartet) that is now becoming a
haven for such pop-world exiles as Emmylou Harris, Randy Newman and
Magnetic Fields.</TE>
<TE>   When the New York company releases "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" on April
23, it will close the door on one of the most public artist-label
conflicts of recent years. It's one that illustrates how the recent
wave of consolidation in the record business is more than a distant,
boardroom abstraction. It's something whose repercussions can affect
the artist-label relationship at its most basic level--getting the
record out.</TE>
<TE>   Standoffs between artist and the artists and repertoire
department--the division responsible for signing and developing
acts--aren't a rarity, but they're usually ironed out, often with
guidance from the label's higher management.</TE>
<TE>   But with instability and executive turnover increasingly common in
the wake of mergers, falling sales and rising costs, that higher
management isn't always there. That was the case at Reprise, the
Burbank-based sister label of Warner Bros. Records, as Wilco put its
fourth album in the mail.</TE>
<TE>   Parent company AOL Time Warner had initiated a huge reorganization
at the labels in March 2001, leading to Reprise chief Howie Klein's
resignation in June. Warner Bros. President Phil Quartararo was
running a combined Warner/Reprise operation in the aftermath, but his
powers were limited by heavy staff cuts and the fact that Tom
Whalley, a highly respected Interscope executive who had agreed to
become chairman, was scheduled to take over in January 2002.</TE>
<TE>   So "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" was dropped into a churning sea.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time Warners was in a transition. I was a little confused
as to what was going on or what I was supposed to do," says David
Kahne, then head of the A&amp;R department and the man who's been blamed
in most accounts for the Wilco falling-out. "If Tom [Whalley] had
been there, he might have said no, we have to put this record out, or
he might have said no we shouldn't ... it was a confusing time."</TE>
<TE>   Though Kahne, who left the label after Whalley took power earlier
this year, disputes the widespread portrayal of Reprise as
art-be-damned product-pushers, there's no question that after a final
phone conversation in July between the executive and Wilco's manager,
the label and the band started filling out the divorce papers.</TE>
<TE>   Says Tweedy, "I've never seen a legal department work that fast in
my life. That was weird. They really wanted us out of there."</TE>
<TE>   The Wilco situation could have been just an instructive footnote
in Music Business 101, but as the episode unfolded it started getting
extensive coverage in music trade publications and in Chicago
newspapers, which covered their hometown heroes' woes the way they
did Michael Jordan's rift with the Bulls. The story assumed symbolic
terms, a contest between art and commerce, with valiant heroes and
dastardly villains.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always a tendency in these situations to want to paint it
in black-and-white," cautions Wilco's manager, Tony Margherita. "I
don't think that's really the case."</TE>
<TE>   Why such a lather over a modest-selling, mild-mannered cult band?
Credit the unusual degree of fan loyalty and critical currency
invested in Wilco, which has reached the threshold of that promised
land--being regarded as a "great American band," in the tradition of
R.E.M., the Band and others with a grounding in root musical forms
and the ambition to somehow plumb the national spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot," which was mixed by leading Chicago
avant-rock figure Jim O'Rourke, might not be an easy sell for the
promotion department, but by any measure it's a rich, intriguing
work.</TE>
<TE>   The album introduces new drummer Glenn Kotche (part of a somewhat
rancorous personnel turnover), whose unusual kit includes found
objects, homemade items and a bank of crotales tuned cymbals that
chime infinitely into the music's vast spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Exploring a sort of folk-pop minimalism, Tweedy offers melodic
reveries whose gamelan-like delicacy is regularly disrupted by
squalls of static (the album's title comes from a phrase spoken in a
spurt of shortwave radio transmission). His lyrics capture loss with
directness and economy, though a few eerie-in-retrospect lines are
likely to draw the most attention--"Tall buildings shake/voices
escape singing sad sad songs.... Voices whine/skyscrapers are
scraping together."</TE>
<TE>   Musically, it's not where you might have predicted Wilco would
arrive when Tweedy, a native of Belleville, Ill., started the band
after the 1993 breakup of his group Uncle Tupelo. Tupelo's four
albums sparked the alternative country movement, a youthful
reinvention of folk and country music that has evolved into a
thriving genre, producing critically acclaimed artists (including
Tweedy's former Uncle Tupelo partner Jay Farrar) and an active
support network of fans, labels and publications.</TE>
<TE>   Wilco (whose reputation was enhanced by the two "Mermaid Avenue"
albums, in which it teamed with singer-songwriter Billy Bragg to
write music for and record unpublished lyrics by folk icon Woody
Guthrie) remains an alt-country touchstone, even as its music has
followed Tweedy's eclectic interests into experimental pop territory
over the course of its Reprise albums, "A.M.," "Being There" and
"Summerteeth," and now "Foxtrot."</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like this stuff makes sense," says Tweedy, 34, sitting at
a table in a small studio at the radio station. "I really feel
passionately like it belongs there. I'm just excited by it."</TE>
<TE>   The record company was less excited, Wilco surmised, when the band
didn't get any response after sending in the record last June. When
Wilco finally made contact with the label, it got word of the
company's disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a stranger punching you in the stomach or something,
or being cut off on the highway," Tweedy says. "You can have your
feelings hurt by that sometimes, but it doesn't resonate very long
usually.... It didn't shake us at all beyond that initial shock."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the band bounced back quickly, playing a scheduled tour
of sold-out shows after letting fans become familiar with "Foxtrot"
by streaming the album on its Web site. And the band seems a perfect
fit for Nonesuch, whose success with "Buena Vista Social Club" has
reinforced its reputation for finding audiences for unlikely music.
Margherita says he'll be disappointed if "Foxtrot" doesn't sell more
than the 162,000 logged by "Summerteeth."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Kahne, the former Reprise executive whose credits as a
producer range from the Bangles to Tony Bennett to the recent Paul
McCartney album, feels stung by being demonized in the press as an
enemy of artistry.</TE>
<TE>   "My reservations were not, 'This music sucks,'" Kahne says. "I
never said it was 'career ending.' There were some really funny songs
and clever songs. Whether or not it was something that would get on
the radio and help [Wilco] was something else.</TE>
<TE>   "There seemed to be a kind of decline in the sales [of
'Summerteeth']. I'm always looking for something to help in that
place. I've noticed that the bands that get on the radio are the ones
that do the best, and that doesn't mean they've sold out. The Sublime
record I did, 'What I Got,' got all over the radio and really helped
that band, and they didn't lose any credibility at all.... I wanted
to make sure there's a track on here that will do that."</TE>
<TE>   Without that track, says Kahne, the likely scenario was that the
album would not find much support in the marketing and promotion
departments. But if Wilco had wanted to stay, he adds, the label
would have put out the record.</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly a ringing invitation.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no bad feelings about Reprise or David," Margherita says.
"We just sort of chose to disagree. The fact of the matter, though,
is the reason that what came down came down was that they showed no
enthusiasm for the record."</TE>
<TE>   Some observers see Reprise as the ultimate loser. "You just don't
let a Wilco go," says a source close to the group. "They'd be the
perfect band for the label now that Warners is selling some records
again. They'd be in the perfect place now, a label with clout having
a band like Wilco to promote."</TE>
<TE>   Amid the uncertainty at the label at the time, even the president
took a limited role.</TE>
<TE>   "[Phil] Quartararo came to me once it became clear that we were on
our way out," the manager says. "He was supportive, he wanted to make
sure what was happening was what the band wanted to see happen. He
called several times and inquired as to what we were thinking."
(Quartararo could not be reached for comment.)</TE>
<TE>   What Wilco was thinking was, basically, "Oh boy!"</TE>
<TE>   "They got paid to leave Warners," Kahne notes, "they have no debt,
they're on a label that's smaller that's looking to market them more.
So I didn't see what the beef was. It seemed like as artists it might
have ended up better for them."</TE>
<TE>   No argument there from Wilco.</TE>
<TE>   "There were definitely times that it was difficult and stressful
for everyone involved," the group's manager says. "But we got what we
wanted."</TE>

<DH>There is a minor boom in single-location stories, which
force moviemakers to maintain drama without scene changes.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Alfred Hitchcock was preparing to make "Dial M for Murder" in
1954, the big question was how to turn the hit play into a hit movie.
Director and former film historian Peter Bogdanovich recalled
Hitchcock's solution, imitating the suspense master's phlegmatic
drawl: "Doooon't make it cinematic. Just shoot it." Bogdanovich, who
interviewed Hitchcock in 1963, continued: "When I asked why he didn't
open it up, Hitchcock said he didn't believe if you had a successful
play that you should fuss around with the construction. And it didn't
seem to hurt 'Dial M for Murder,' which took place almost entirely in
one apartment."</LD>
<LD>   Bogdanovich brought up Hitchcock while discussing his latest
directorial effort, "The Cat's Meow," which opened Friday and which
also takes place primarily in one location. A fact-based story about
the mysterious death in 1924 of Hollywood producer Thomas Ince aboard
William Randolph Hearst's yacht, "The Cat's Meow" is one of several
recent films that squeeze maximum dramatic tension from a minimal
amount of space.</LD>
<LD>   "Panic Room," directed by David Fincher, depicts a single mom
(Jodie Foster) and her daughter hiding in a high-tech cubbyhole after
thieves invade their New York apartment. Ethan Hawke's directorial
debut "Chelsea Walls," which opens Friday, is set entirely in
Manhattan's legendary Chelsea Hotel.</LD>
<TE>   Last year's "Final," a futuristic thriller starring Denis Leary
and Hope Davis, was filmed at a former Connecticut psychiatric
hospital by actor-turned-director Campbell Scott. In "Tape," also
from last year, three former friends (Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean
Leonard, Uma Thurman) spend the entire movie sequestered in a seedy
motel room while they revisit a traumatic high school incident. For
the haunted insane asylum drama "Session 9," writer-director Brad
Anderson found all the atmosphere he needed in an abandoned
Victorian-era hospital outside Boston. "The Anniversary Party,"
Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming's satiric look at neurotic
show-biz relationships, takes place during a party at a single
Hollywood Hills home.</TE>
<TE>   Other single-setting indie features include last fall's "The
Business of Strangers," in which a corporate executive (Stockard
Channing) and her just-fired assistant (Julia Stiles) play
psychosexual mind games while stuck overnight in an antiseptic
airport hotel. The politically charged ghost story "The Devil's
Backbone" unfolds within the confines of a Spanish orphanage.</TE>
<TE>   Actors have always loved single-location films: They don't have to
compete with the scenery (see related story, Page 19). Resourceful
directors also enjoy the challenge of a static setting. Observed
Bogdanovich, "There's something about the unity of place and time and
circumstance, which the Greeks knew about and which certainly applied
in 'Cat's Meow.'" During an overnight cruise from San Pedro to San
Diego, Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard), Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst)
and Hearst (Edward Herrmann) party through the night with a gaggle of
Hollywood hangers-on, then wake to find a dead man on board.</TE>
<TE>   Filming off the coast of Greece and shooting interior scenes on a
Berlin sound stage, Bogdanovich wanted to create the illusion of a
single setting and asked writer Steven Peros to compress the
screenplay so that all key scenes would transpire on the yacht.</TE>
<TE>   "Enclosures--a ship, a hotel, a train ride--are very good for
drama," Bogdanovich said. "I think it increases the audience's
suspense. It's not coincidental that Agatha Christie would use that
sort of thing. In 'Cat's Meow' you have a single location, but it's
traveling, which gives the story a certain momentum."</TE>
<TE>   Writer David Koepp came up with the idea for "Panic Room" when he
moved to New York in 1999 with his family and started renovating a
four-story brownstone.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized ... this is a cool setting for a thriller," said
Koepp, who a few years earlier had read about hidden, impenetrable
"safe rooms" to which residents could retreat in the event of a home
invasion or kidnapping attempt. "It just seemed like such a great
paranoid thing: There's this tiny space within this great vertical
space that's narrow and tall and kind of confining on its own, but it
still gives you great visual opportunities like skylights and
stairwells."</TE>
<TE>   Koepp has scripted his share of epic-scale pictures, including
"Jurassic Park," but he enjoyed working within the constrained
universe of "Panic Room." "It definitely increases the dramatic
tension," he said, "and it also forces you as the writer or David
Fincher as the director into more creative choices because you're
limiting the number of colors you can paint the thing with."</TE>
<TE>   "Devil's Backbone" director Guillermo del Toro edited together
four locations to create the Santa Lucia school, which houses orphans
whose parents have been killed by Franco's Republican forces. For
exteriors, a "dummy" building with no interior was built on a vast,
empty plain outside Madrid. Said Del Toro, "I wanted to use the
location metaphorically to get across the idea that Spain was so
isolated in 1939--there's this great quote about that war, 'Spain was
a peninsula that turned into an island'--so I wanted this feeling of
isolation."</TE>
<TE>   Del Toro also populated his stressful institution with a
cross-section of Spanish society. "I wanted to create a
micro-universe, which Hitchcock did so well in 'Lifeboat,' where
you've got the high-society people, the working class and, it turns
out, one Nazi all on this one lifeboat. You get the whole social
strata."</TE>
<TE>   The school's hybrid architecture served to subtly symbolize
Spain's tumultuous history, Del Toro said. "I wanted a building that
had different parts--Romanesque arches, then steel grids holding up
the walls that were probably built in the '20s, so you get this sort
of Frankenstein building."</TE>
<TE>   "Backbone's" story concerns the vengeful ghost of a murdered boy.
In the best haunted-house tradition, the school's secrets are hidden
behind, and within, a labyrinth of enclosures. "We wanted to keep
finding spaces within the space," the director explained, "so we go
underneath the boys' beds, the closet in the hall, the basement, the
locker."</TE>
<TE>   Ethan Hawke had a different sort of ghost story in mind for
"Chelsea Walls." Rattling off the names of famous Chelsea Hotel
residents such as Andy Warhol, Jack Kerouac and Thomas Wolfe as well
as "live hard, die young" Sex Pistol and heroin addict Sid Vicious,
Hawke mused, "I've always thought that the Chelsea Hotel is full of
ghosts, with all these lives passing through there. One of our hopes
in making the movie was to make it feel like a ghost story, in a
strange way."</TE>
<TE>   To ensure an authentic look and feel, Hawke had Kris
Kristofferson, Uma Thurman, Robert Sean Leonard, Steve Zahn and other
cast members play some scenes in rooms untouched by set decorators.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a big studio and try to make a movie at the Chelsea,
they'd charge you an arm and a leg," Hawke said. "The people who live
there and the hotel staff are so friendly to any kind of experimental
art form that we were able to shoot in actual rooms that belong to
residents."</TE>
<TE>   Hawke, Thurman and Leonard also starred last fall in "Tape," which
was shot for about $100,000 in six days on a New York sound stage
dressed to look like a bland Lansing, Mich., motel room. Director
Richard Linklater said, "The location is really what it's about--the
movie could have been called 'Stuck in a Motel Room'--because you,
the audience, and two of the three characters would really like to be
out of there. I liked the trapped-ness of it."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the set simple allowed the actors to focus on performance,
Linklater said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of exhilarating, because, say, it's a 12-hour day:
They were seriously acting 10 of those hours." The ratio is roughly
the reverse in a normal movie, Linklater said: "You actually get to
act maybe 45 minutes a day, two hours if you're lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Created by, for and about actors, "The Anniversary Party" takes
place in and around a sleek glass-walled house designed by L.A.
architect Richard Neutra.</TE>
<TE>   Leigh said, "Whenever we would think about the house for the
couple that we wrote, it was always a mid-century modern house that
we'd see in our mind."</TE>
<TE>   Leigh, who cast Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Kline, Phoebe Cates, John
C. Reilly and other friends, said, "We wanted a glass house because
there is something unprotected and exposed about these characters,
and that seemed a perfect metaphor. The film's about being exposed,
it's about people who live in glass houses."</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by "The Celebration," Thomas Vinterberg's 1998 Dogma film
about a birthday party that turns ugly in the course of one drunken
evening, Leigh appeared in "The King Is Alive," a 2001 film about 11
European tourists who gradually go mad after their bus breaks down in
the African desert. Leigh said she's always enjoyed stories that
force characters into a "pressure cooker" setting. "Then the
characters all disintegrate and go to hell."</TE>

<HD>The Search Is On</HD>
<DH>As labels clamor for female singers who can match Diana
Krall's sales, jazz's boundaries are changing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's going on with women jazz singers? Suddenly, it seems, they're
all over the place--from pictures of a leggy Diana Krall popping up
in Target store ads to Dianne Reeves performing at the Winter
Olympics closing ceremony to the much-hyped arrival of another
knockout young star, Norah Jones. Established artists are receiving
more attention than ever and every jazz label is looking to swing the
Next Big Thing.</LD>
<LD>   Blame it on Krall. Sure, there were other jazz singers around a
few years ago, all doing fine work in their individual styles:
Reeves, Cassandra Wilson, Karrin Allyson, Nnenna Freelon, to name
only a few.</LD>
<LD>   But it was Krall, 36, who took it to another level, raising the
bar of potential for a genre that had never before generated pop-size
sales figures. Two years ago, she released an album, "When I Look in
Your Eyes," that not only won the Grammy jazz album category, but was
also nominated as overall album of the year--which had only occurred
one other time, in 1964, when Stan Getz and Joao Gilberto won. The
exposure from Krall's nomination spurred the album's sales, now
totaling more than 1.2 million copies in the U.S. Her follow-up
album, "The Look of Love," has also surpassed the 1-million
mark--easily the biggest numbers ever by a jazz vocalist since
SoundScan began accurately measuring sales in the early '90s.</LD>
<TE>   Seemingly ever since Krall's breakout, jazz singers, would-be-jazz
singers, sort-of-jazz singers and pop-jazz singers are coming out of
the woodwork.</TE>
<TE>   Elegant Jane Monheit, 24, with her flowing mane of black hair and
precise vocal articulation, arrived in 2000. Monheit's first album,
"Never Never Land," zoomed to the top of the jazz charts, selling
more than 100,000 copies, breaking the five- or even four-figure
standard typical of new jazz vocal talent. Her second album, "Come
Dream With Me,'' has sold 200,000 copies in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, New York-born, Texas-raised Norah Jones arrived,
heralded by an aggressive promotional campaign that saw features in
major newspapers and magazines even before the 22-year-old singer's
first album had been released. In the six weeks since its release by
Blue Note, more than 300,000 copies of Jones' debut CD, "Come Away
With Me," have been sold.</TE>
<TE>   Those aren't numbers one commonly sees in the jazz record
business, where instrumental albums--even by well-known artists--can
top out at sales levels of 20,000 to 30,000. The Jones CD, in fact,
has been pouring out at the rate of 20,000 a week, well beyond
Monheit's rate, and in the ballpark with Krall's numbers.</TE>
<TE>   So what's happening here? Even granting Krall's remarkable
achievements, why is there so much activity in a genre that has
generally tended--with the exception of such figures as Billie
Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan--to be viewed as an
adjunct to the more serious business of instrumental jazz?</TE>
<TE>   The answer has many facets: Jazz singers are beginning to reach
listeners in the younger age ranges; the vocalists are not hesitating
to explore contemporary songs; they're helping to alleviate boardroom
concerns about the music's financial viability--and don't disregard
the marketing potential of young, pretty faces.</TE>
<TE>   Even a record executive who has spent a career in the relatively
low-pressure environment of the jazz world can't help but notice the
kind of sales generated by Krall, Monheit and Jones. Combine that
with the continuing successes of Wilson, whose "New Moon Daughter,"
released in 1995, has sold more than half a million copies worldwide,
and Reeves, who was hitting six-figure sales as far back as the '80s,
and the message is loud and clear: Women jazz singers are selling,
and you'd better find one or two of your own.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now actively looking for young, jazz vocal artists," says
Verve Group CEO Ron Goldstein. "Obviously, we're looking for the best
talent we can find, but we're also very much aware of the fact that
the singers who seem to be generating the biggest numbers are female
artists."</TE>
<TE>   Already in the Verve stable is Lizz Wright, 22, who has been
raising expectations with the initial tracks from her guest
appearance on a forthcoming Joe Sample album. And there's Paula West,
with three albums out on small labels, who has received rave reviews
wherever she performs but, amazingly, has not yet been locked up by
one of the larger jazz record companies.</TE>
<TE>   With Jones already on his roster, Blue Note President Bruce
Lundvall is also actively in the search. "Of course, we're looking,"
he says. "But remember that this is a trend that has slowly been
gathering steam. Look at our roster: Blue Note was traditionally an
instrumental company, but we currently have--in addition to Norah and
Cassandra--Patricia Barber, Rachelle Ferrell, Bobby McFerrin and Kurt
Elling. And, for a while, we had Lena Horne and Holly Cole. So we're
well aware of the impact that singers can have on our bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Even Lundvall, however, did not anticipate Jones' impact. "What's
happening reaches well beyond Blue Note, up to the Capitol corporate
level," he says. Then, with a laugh, he adds, "I mean, this is
serious stuff. It takes me back to my old pop music days when I was
back at Columbia."</TE>
<TE>   Those were the days when Columbia had an active jazz program to
match its successes in popular music. The case could be made that it
was the torrid sales of pop acts in the '60s and '70s that made it
possible for the majors to carry less profitable jazz artists on
their rosters. But Columbia is now principally in the reissue
business via its Legacy imprint, RCA maintains a small roster but is
also actively working its catalog, and Warner Bros. concentrates on a
few artists: Pat Metheny, Brad Mehldau and Joshua Redman, along with
smooth jazz acts Boney James, Kirk Whalum and Bob James.</TE>
<TE>   It's a different ballgame now. But, interestingly, the singers'
successes are now providing jazz labels such as Verve and Blue Note
with a financial foundation that makes it possible for them to
support their existing instrumental rosters as well as efforts to
develop new talent. Equally important, the numbers generated by Krall
and Jones carry weight at higher levels of the company.</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't believe how much I'm hearing from corporate, now
that the Jones thing is happening," Lundvall says.</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing, of course, to observe that female jazz singers are
selling albums; it's something else to find them. "There are plenty
out there," says Ralph McDonnell, the founder of MaxJazz, a company
that has built its early reputation upon a roster of singers,
including Carla Cook and Rene Marie. "The problem is that there are
only a few good ones."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the initial tendency was to find artists with
qualities similar to Krall.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah, the blonds have been coming," says Tommy LiPuma, Verve
Group chairman and producer of Krall's string of hit CDs. "Not as
many as you might think, but they're in there, in all the other
singers' demo tapes and videos that are showing up."</TE>
<TE>   Lundvall agrees: "I've passed on so many Diana Krall look-alikes,
sound-alikes. They come in all the time--another blond girl who plays
the piano and sings."</TE>
<TE>   That raises another issue: None of the primary headliners in the
current jazz vocal revival--Krall, Monheit and Jones--is African
American. Race is a touchy issue in jazz, given that issues of
authenticity and ownership continue to provide fodder for debate.</TE>
<TE>   "The question of why they're white is an interesting question, so
long as no one is asking if they should all be white," says jazz
critic and historian Stanley Crouch. "My basic feeling is that Jane
Monheit can sing; she's young but she has a very good instrument. She
and Diana Krall are bringing young people into jazz and introducing
them to higher quality repertoire at a time when almost all popular
music has been on a vamp, not going anywhere, for about 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   "And wouldn't it be a grand irony if people like Monheit and Krall
created an appetite in the public that allowed a Cassandra Wilson to
sing far more interesting material, of the sort that would reveal a
great deal more about her substantial talent?"</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the answer, the real test may come with the response that
greets Wright, a 22-year-old African American performer described by
Verve's Goldstein as "the full package ... great voice, charismatic
stage presence, and poise way beyond her years." She comes from a
gospel background and makes regular appearances with Atlanta's highly
praised jazz ensemble In the Spirit. Her first album is due out later
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, record companies would love for their jazz A&amp;R (artists
and repertoire) executives--specialists in finding and working with
talent--to locate gifted neophytes through the tried-and-true method
of getting out to clubs, tapping into the grapevine and networking
with musicians, who are usually the first to know who's hot. But
Jones--who attended the acclaimed jazz program at North Texas State
University in Denton--came to Blue Note on a recommendation from
someone who worked in the company's administrative area.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was first approached, I said I'd listen," recalls
Lundvall, "primarily because it was someone at the company who
brought her in. But after about three tunes, I knew I wanted her on
Blue Note."</TE>
<TE>   Krall was a known quantity to many musicians, and had recorded for
a Canadian label before LiPuma brought her to Verve and began working
with her in 1994, gradually building an audience through five
increasingly successful albums.</TE>
<TE>   Monheit came to the attention of virtually the entire jazz
industry in 1998 when, at the age of 20, she was the first runner-up
in the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz vocal competition. Signed by
N-Coded Records in 2000, she then hooked up with Jazz Tree
Management, the company that handled Krall in the early establishment
of her career.</TE>
<TE>   All this may suggest that A&amp;R execs have not played an especially
important role in the jazz singer breakout, but it's probably too
soon to tell. With the word out, it's a sure bet that tons of demo
tapes are now being scrutinized in A&amp;R offices, and clubs that book
singers on a regular basis can expect record executives to be making
frequent appearances.</TE>
<TE>   One difficulty for everyone trying to ride this resurgence is the
age-old question: What exactly makes a jazz singer? There are plenty
of opinions, many of them hardened by the crossover qualities in the
recordings of Jones, Wilson, Reeves and others.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' "Come Away With Me" and Wilson's latest recording, "Belly
of the Sun," in particular, have raised hackles among those observers
who refuse to view the albums as jazz efforts. It's a bit difficult
to understand the reaction to Wilson, who has been expanding her view
of repertoire since she included songs by Hank Williams, Neil Young,
Robert Johnson, Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell and even the Monkees on
her first Blue Note albums, "Blue Light Til Dawn" and "New Moon
Daughter."</TE>
<TE>   But even Blue Note's Lundvall initially had doubts about
categorizing the Jones album. "When I signed Norah, I thought she was
going to make a jazz record--Horace Silver, Ellington, maybe a few
contemporary songs. But we ended up with just 'The Nearness of You'
as the only sort of straight-ahead jazz-type tune. So I said, 'Look,
Norah, let's put this on our Manhattan label,' which is more
pop-oriented. And she said, 'Absolutely not. I signed to Blue Note.'
And I said, 'OK, why not?'</TE>
<TE>   "Why should we have such narrow confines as to what jazz is or
isn't? If we're really going to expand the market for the music, let
the artists do what they believe in."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, unfazed by genres, points out that her background has been
in jazz, but--at this particular time--"Come Away With Me" was the
recording she wanted to make.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a sleeper kind of album. But that's the kind of
music I like. I like records that have an atmosphere throughout, no
matter how you define it. Because I just basically want to record
songs that I love, and I want to do them in a way that is honest to
each of the songs."</TE>
<TE>   The perception of Monheit has been a bit different, with critics
insisting she should be considered a cabaret singer, or perhaps a
musical theater singer, rather than a jazz artist. That view
undoubtedly has been furthered by the beauty of Monheit's voice,
which would indeed sound just fine on the Broadway stage. But her
phrasing and her sense of rhythmic time are built on a jazz
foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "For a long time, I could have gone in either direction," Monheit
says. "I loved musical theater when I was a teenager and I had a
great time doing it. But as far as music goes, I was always
incredibly serious about jazz, and I've always known that was my
primary direction."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Monheit nor Krall have indicated as much fascination as
Wilson and Jones have for diversifying their repertoire. Although
Krall has expressed interest in the possibility of reaching into more
contemporary material, she is still entranced by the material in the
Great American Songbook--the music of Gershwin, Porter, Kern, Rodgers
&amp; Hart, et al.</TE>
<TE>   "She'll get around to newer material," LiPuma says. "But for now
Diana is still captivated by all the great standards."</TE>
<TE>   With Krall, the questions surrounding the definition of jazz
singing take a somewhat different slant. She continues to be
mystified that--despite her dedication to the standard jazz song
repertoire--she must still deal with potshots from the cognoscenti
about her authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent so many years working on my jazz chops, trying to
maintain my integrity," Krall says, "and now I sometimes hear, 'Oh,
Diana's gone, she's not a jazz musician, she's a pop artist.' Well,
just because you have some sort of success or you're blond or
something doesn't mean that you can't be a jazz artist."</TE>
<TE>   If anything is clear about this surge of interest, it's that the
definition of what constitutes jazz singing must be expanded. Or, at
the very least, reconsidered. After all, popular songs have always
been essential elements in the repertoire of jazz singing. And,
extraordinary as that Great American Songbook may be, there's no
reason--as Wilson, Reeves and others have been insisting--that it
can't be complemented by the music of Lennon &amp; McCartney, Billy Joel,
Elton John, Paul Simon and James Taylor, to name a few.</TE>
<TE>   "Jazz in general, and jazz singing specifically, over a long, long
time has been a collector of musical ideas from other places," says
MaxJazz's McDonnell. "And how can you not like that? It's the way the
music has always evolved, and the way it will continue to evolve."</TE>

<HD>His Human Touch</HD>
<DH>Mstislav Rostropovich makes music the way he makes friends:
with all his heart. That's how he's inspired the 20th century's key
composers and today's musicians.</DH>

<LD>LONDON--It is Mstislav Rostropovich's birthday, but he's doling out
as many kisses as he's receiving.</LD>
<LD>   For two weeks, the Russian cellist, conductor and pianist has been
celebrating his 75th (actual date: March 27) with a residency at the
London Symphony Orchestra, conducting half a dozen programs devoted
to his "good friends" Prokofiev, Shostakovich and Benjamin Britten.</LD>
<LD>   In his last outing in the fortnight, he is joined in a Britten
program at the Barbican Centre by another close friend, 27-year-old
Russian violinist Maxim Vengerov. The audience is already cheering
when the maestro grazes Vengerov's cheeks at the end of the concert,
but it explodes when he smacks Vengerov squarely on the lips.</LD>
<TE>   This is not surprising behavior from the lovable man everyone
calls "Slava" (a short version of his first name translating as
"Glory"). Through his relationships with the world's most prominent
musicians and composers, Rostropovich has helped inspire a
significant portion of 20th century music: Nearly 200 works have been
written for him either as soloist or conductor (Prokofiev, Britten
and Shostakovich were among his benefactors). He has received more
than 40 honorary degrees, some 130 awards, and the abundant affection
and respect of peers and public alike. And he has long been an
outspoken voice for human freedom. He risked his own well-being to
defend his friends against the former Soviet regime. When the Berlin
Wall fell, he famously jetted there the next day to serenade the
celebrants, tears streaming down his cheeks. In 1991, he joined Boris
Yeltsin inside the Russian parliament building as a show of
solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   But on this important birthday, the man being celebrated has
chosen to use his talent for human connections to pay tribute to his
colleagues, past, present and future. The audience loves Vengerov,
but perhaps no one claps more avidly than Rostropovich.</TE>
<TE>   "Britten's old friend Rostropovich belies his age to soar again,"
London's Sunday Observer said in a review of the concert. The Evening
Standard called him a "birthday boy of scintillating panache." And
the Guardian reported that "with typical generosity, he diverted the
focus from himself."</TE>
<TE>   The day after the Britten concert, Rostropovich joins the London
Symphony Orchestra at Air Studios, a dramatic recording space in a
converted church in northwest London. They're rehearsing
Shostakovich's Eighth Symphony, which they will perform at Lincoln
Center later this month, part of a birthday tour of the United States
that includes appearances in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Seattle,
San Francisco, Toledo, Atlanta, Chicago, Costa Mesa and Santa
Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   This is an orchestra he knows and loves (he says every single
member is a friend), first performing with it in 1961 and earning
honorary membership 14 years ago. Half-perched on a leather-topped
stool with the tailored shirt of his gray suit purposefully untucked,
the barrel-chested, gray-haired Rostropovich conducts with athletic
vigor, taking breaks only to give notes to the players. He cracks a
joke, sings a few bars, pounds out the rhythm with powerful hands.</TE>
<TE>   After the rehearsal, Rostropovich has agreed to spend an hour
being interviewed with an interpreter at his side--a security blanket
he often uses despite living mostly in the West since the 1970s. The
Soviet Union, which honored him in 1951 with its top award, the
Stalin Prize, later punished him for supporting such musicians as
Prokofiev and Shostakovich, and for sheltering the dissident writer
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Forced into the welcoming arms of the West in
1974, Rostropovich and his wife--soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, whom he
has accompanied on piano throughout the world--and two daughters were
soon stripped of their citizenship. In 1977, he landed a job as
conductor of the National Symphony in Washington, a post he held for
17 years.</TE>
<TE>   But he has ended rehearsal early, and the translator isn't due for
another hour, so he decides to brave it alone. He breezes into the
Green Room at the former church, plunks down a bag of unopened
birthday presents and a briefcase stuffed with scores, and rushes up
to greet his interviewer with a trio of kisses (left, right, left).
He sips English tea milkless, in observance of Orthodox Lent. But he
isn't waiting until Easter for his chocolate. He breaks open the foil
on a bar of French noir with gusto and devours the whole thing in
minutes--save the pieces he has insisted on sharing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tired," begins the famously tireless Rostropovich, who has
slept only two hours, returning after last night's post-concert party
to an apartment in the midst of renovations and to a pile of letters
and faxes. He goes on to show no signs of tiredness.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't really need an interpreter. Apart from the sometimes
garbled pronunciation and dropped notes of his English, the melody is
clear and eloquent. "Difficult because most difficult symphony
Shostakovich," he says, referring to the rehearsal, his voice blurred
with chocolate. "Long time no play."</TE>
<TE>   Today, he is certain, Shostakovich was sitting on his shoulder in
the studio, coaching him on the nuances and mechanics of the score.
"I'm so proud," he says, "because I make concert with my three
kings--Prokofiev, Shostakovich and Benjamin Britten. Not only three
geniuses, but I was very close to them humanly. I tell you honestly:
I don't worry if I died. Because I'm sure my friends wait me there."
He points a long index finger skyward.</TE>
<TE>   He's sure they all made it to heaven?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yes. I'm sure," he says, and laughs conspiratorially. "About
me maybe I more doubt!"</TE>
<TE>   He seems to have a particularly soft spot in his heart for
Shostakovich, a man some scholars have accused of making too many
concessions to the regime.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how much he suffer," Rostropovich says, "but I think if
for example Shostakovich not so much suffer, he composed such music
or not? That's the important question. Because you know for example
in the United States, maybe many many talented people, but have so
easy life. The music nice, beautiful but music not with
tra-ge-dy--you know?"</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, Rostropovich will perform with the Pacific
Symphony as part of its "Dvorak in America" festival. "His best
symphony is 'New World' Symphony," Rostropovich says. "Was very
different, because he composed in the United States. That's why so
emotional--because he missed his country. For composer that's very
very important. He must suffer."</TE>
<TE>   Rostropovich says that the memory of Shostakovich's pain can still
bring him to tears. "Something different for me when I play
Beethoven," he says. "I don't know him personally, so I don't know
how he suffer, how he express. For Shostakovich, most definitely I
know how his face when he is sad."</TE>
<TE>   Although Rostropovich says that remembering that face is a useful
tool for interpreting the music, he quickly points out that a cellist
or a conductor is not required to suffer in the same way. "Performer
like a priest in the church," he says. "Priest no tell his words. He
just transfer words from God to the people. Of course, he uses some
words for explaining. But he not composer. He only guide for transfer
idea from God to the people. We transfer idea from the composer."</TE>
<TE>   He says there are two kinds of performers: technical showoffs and
those who submit themselves to the complex emotions of the creator.</TE>
<TE>   "If I play Dvorak concerto, I feel I am Dvorak," he says. "I feel
that I suffer--or I have hope. Because music have emotion always.
Great performer give this emotion--not only technique. And this
transfer to the public."</TE>
<TE>   But that role as a transmitter of emotions is different for him as
a cellist and as a conductor. "Cellist I have my finger," he
explains, raising up his hands and playing a phantom phrase. "My
nerves touch string, and all that I would like, all I feel coming
direct to me from to my instrument. Conductor, I have no contact with
instrument; between instrument and myself another human being. I must
explain to him in some miracle way that's very mysterious how I like
him to perform this phrase, or the emotion. For conductor very
important, have such telepathy contact, human to human. Because if he
trust me, if he love me, he understand my message. That's why in
rehearsal I never make for musicians some doubt. I only tell him,
'Bravo, but maybe you make this note just a little shorter.' I know
if I make not very tactful rehearsal comments, in concert make for me
very bad."</TE>
<TE>   And where did he learn that little bit of psychology?</TE>
<TE>   "I am 75 years old, my love," he says with a sly smile. "And
second, I am not completely idiot."</TE>
<TE>   Rostropovich has long been considered a technical and emotional
master of his instrument, a cellist who always played by heart, often
wearing an expression--eyes closed, head tilted up and to the side,
mouth bent into a Charlie Brown smile--that looks something like the
definition of bliss.</TE>
<TE>   London Symphony co-principal cellist Moray Welsh studied with
Rostropovich in Moscow in 1969 and in the residency program notes he
wrote, "I was fascinated by his astounding mastery of the cello. [He]
always possessed a unique sound, instantly recognizable."</TE>
<TE>   As a conductor, he is sometimes criticized for keeping his nose in
the score, his "wild" style being hard for musicians to follow. But
Welsh told the BBC that while it can be hard to follow him note for
note, his energy and the heartfelt drama he brings to the podium are
unparalleled in creating the right atmosphere for a piece of music.</TE>
<TE>   There have been "several propositions" for music directorships,
but at this stage of his life, Rostropovich doesn't want the
administrative responsibilities that accompany the job. He's still on
the whirlwind schedule he has always maintained. He hasn't seen a
movie in 20 years, and his wife is on record saying he should slow
down. But he says his next vacation will be that great vacation in
the sky.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally I live on airplane," he says, adding that he is working
on consolidating his archives, which are divided among his homes in
London, Paris, Moscow, Geneva, Lausanne and New York state.</TE>
<TE>   He says sheepishly that three Russian museums are being
constructed in his honor. "I not accept this if it was just to
me--but it's to my father and me," he says. Leopold Rostropovich was
a cellist and professor in whose cello case he slept as a baby. "I
very happy about that. Because if I died--" he says, correcting
himself "--of course I die! After that, make museum. But not now."</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to premiere a Krzysztof Penderecki concerto in
2003, but he won't commit to any new works after that.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell you in 2003 how I feel," he says. "Maybe I tired for new
music. Maybe I would like for new generation of cellist found for
[new] generation composer. I conduct approximately 80 premieres, and
as cellist I play 120. I think that good example for young people."</TE>
<TE>   He will be both conducting and performing in the U.S., but he is
definitely spending more time on the podium these days. "I see how I
perform, but for example I already not perform symphony concerto
Shostakovich," he says, "because 75 years you have not so fresh
muscles.</TE>
<TE>   "And I see one videotape when I perform symphony concerto of
Shostakovich. I amazed. I very good!" He laughs. "I don't like make
comparison with myself, and I maybe now not so brilliant. But some
repertoire I better than before, not have so much physical but
emotional."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly the door to the Green Room opens and in pops the
floppy-haired head of yet another one of Rostropovich's good friends,
Boston Symphony music director Seiji Ozawa, who has come to whisk the
cellist off to Buckingham Palace, where they are rehearsing for a
private concert arranged by Prince Charles.</TE>
<TE>   "Hello!" Ozawa shouts, and they embrace.</TE>
<TE>   "For me is greatest conductor in the world," Rostropovich says,
patting Ozawa's shoulder, shifting the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   "This is big brother," Ozawa counters, kneeling by Rostropovich's
chair. "Music and life. Music I learn so much, so many years."</TE>
<TE>   Then he looks up and asks: "How many years?"</TE>
<TE>   They try to decide whether they met in 1964 or '65. This month,
Rostropovich will go to Boston to play for Ozawa's 29th and final
season as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and he
will also join Ozawa for a post-season goodbye event at Tanglewood in
July.</TE>
<TE>   "I finish, I finish," Ozawa says, pouting intentionally, shaking
his head.</TE>
<TE>   "You never finish!" Rostropovich exclaims. "You start!"</TE>
<TE>   The translator, who has shown up a few minutes earlier and is
sitting politely, unused, breaks the mood by whipping out her camera
and asking in Russian if she can take a photo of the pals.
Rostropovich throws an arm around Ozawa, lets his head drop onto his
shoulder. Click.</TE>
<TE>   Then he kisses Ozawa on the top of his head.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, it's March 27, the birthday itself, and the London
Symphony is throwing Rostropovich a party, a gala with some of the
world's most distinguished musicians: Ozawa, Vengerov, Penderecki,
pianists Martha Argerich and Evgeny Kissin, conductors Colin Davis
and Zubin Mehta, violist Yuri Bashmet and violinist Gidon Kremer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm his adopted grandson," Vengerov says by telephone
from his hotel room in London, the morning before the gala. "I love
him. There is a great chemistry between us on stage; he's one of the
few conductors that really brings this spark to the music. He has
such an incredibly expressive face. I wish you could see it while
he's conducting, not just from behind. His face is really music--you
can see behind the face the greatest expression, the story, you can
see everything. When I was playing the other night, it was actually
the first time when I was also thinking what I have never thought
before: 'How many times do I have to play with him?' It made me very
sad while I was playing."</TE>
<TE>   At the gala, Rostropovich sits in the audience in a tux with wife
Vishnevskaya and lets his friends play for him. At the end, he walks
on stage, extinguishes the candle on a cello-shaped birthday cake,
blows kisses to the cheering audience. He smiles devilishly while
raising an imaginary glass to his lips, then walks off, to a roar of
laughter and applause.</TE>
<TE>   Backstage, as the performers crowd around, there are more hugs and
kisses.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah!" he exclaims. "What you make for me, my friends! What you
make for me!"</TE>

<DH>Louise Fishman's work has long mirrored her evolving
political and spiritual outlook.</DH>

<LD>Louise Fishman's abstract paintings conform only to her feelings at
the moment of their creation. Some of the paintings are built from
muscular blocks of impure colors: teal, brick, flesh. Others are
woven with sensuous curves in colors such as pewter and sage. Some
are scaled to appear grand, others intimate. A practicing Buddhist,
she says that her goal is to be present before the canvas as she
brushes on the layers of oil paint. "The paintings are like
meditations," she says in her distinct New York City accent.</LD>
<LD>   Fishman, 63, has been called a "third-generation Abstract
Expressionist," and her debut Los Angeles exhibition, from Saturday
to June 1, is being held at the Manny Silverman Gallery, which shows
many of the so-called first- and second-generation Abstract
Expressionists. Fishman readily admits her admiration for those
groundbreaking artists of the 1950s, especially Franz Kline. A few of
the 10 oil paintings in her show reveal the influence of his bold,
choppy strokes, while the three paintings on paper are splashed with
sprays of black.</LD>
<LD>   Art critic Michael Brenson wrote in a catalog essay for her 1993
retrospective at the Tyler Galleries of Temple University in Elkins
Park, Pa., "Fishman's spirituality helps explain why her pictorial
searching is so patient and why her paintings, however muscular, are
not aggressive. And why her monumentality is intimate."</LD>
<TE>   Fishman came to her current expressive style after years as a
pioneer of the Feminist Movement, which rejected the lifestyle as
well as the artistic methods of the hard-drinking, macho Ab Ex group.
Her creative journey of the past 30 years has been the reconciliation
of these two seemingly antithetical movements: Reached at her studio
in Manhattan, Fishman recalled that more than once, "I had to start
from scratch. I had to undo everything so I could start as a
beginner."</TE>
<TE>   As a youngster growing up in Philadelphia, Fishman was consumed
with playing basketball, not with emulating her mother and late aunt,
both painters. But the issues of Artnews magazine around the house,
especially the photographic essays of painters in action, made an
impact. Her father, who was an accountant, hoped she would choose a
practical career, but instead she fell in love with painting.</TE>
<TE>   This lifelong love affair led Fishman to attend the Philadelphia
College of Art and Design and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts
before earning bachelor of fine arts and bachelor of science degrees
from Tyler School of Fine Arts at Temple University, in 1963. Two
years later, she completed her master of fine arts degree at the
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.</TE>
<TE>   She was trained in the traditional manner to grind her own
pigments to make oil paint and to draw and sculpt from a life model.
After moving to New York City in 1965, she abandoned figurative work
to make grid paintings influenced by the Minimalist Sol Lewitt. Then,
in 1970, her political sensibilities underwent the radical shift that
changed her art.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to look at my training and history and finding no women and
what does that mean for me and my identity," she recalls briskly. She
adds that as a lesbian and woman, she found her outlook and painting
were fundamentally transformed as she attended the
consciousness-raising sessions of that era. "Politics influenced my
decision to stop painting the grids," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably one of the most exciting periods for me," she
adds. "Suddenly, it became clear in the context of
consciousness-raising, many of my premises needed to be clarified and
undone. The first thing I did was cut up the grid paintings and
reassemble them."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the 1970s, influenced by the work of the late Eva Hesse
(the subject of a show now at the San Francisco Museum of
Contemporary Art), Fishman stitched canvases and used liquid latex.
She also made paintings with calligraphic gestures that were
influenced by the journal writing of other women in her
consciousness-raising group. A work of four unstretched panels with a
visual narrative and the specifically feminist title "Victory Garden
for the Amazon Queen," was chosen for the 1973 Whitney Biennial.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that personal victory, her growing awareness had unleashed
a fury at past injustices. "I was in a rage that it had taken me so
long to come into my own, that I had to struggle six times as hard as
the guys to do what they slid into very easily. That anger was
poisoning me so I had to put it someplace." It was manifested as the
"Angry Paintings." The first was an abstract self-portrait emblazoned
with the words "Angry Louise."</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, Fishman was a visiting artist teaching at the Art
Institute in Chicago and because of the small size of her studio,
decided to paint ideas on paper for paintings that she would finish
when she returned to New York. For a couple of years, she had been
working on randomly cut shapes of plywood. But the process of working
on rectangles of white paper led her back to a more traditional form
of painting in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as it became clear I had gone through that evolution, I
decided to use the materials and techniques that I had rejected," she
recalls. "I invented painting again in its classical form. I decided
I wanted to embrace it. I got yards of fresh linen and had it
stretched. I allowed myself to immerse myself in the beauty of oil
paint. It was very exciting for me."</TE>
<TE>   From that point, she returned to making abstract oil paintings on
canvas, initially painting so thickly that she used sculpture tools
to model the surface. "I had less and less to do with politics," she
says. "I was by myself doing what I needed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Her pleasure in painting was reinforced by a trip to Italy on a
Guggenheim Fellowship in 1979, when, she says, "I saw the paintings
I'd only seen in reproduction." Citing Duccio, Massacio and Fra
Angelico, she adds, "It felt rich and beautiful. There was that sense
of inventing painting."</TE>
<TE>   Inventing painting is what Fishman proceeded to do throughout the
1980s. She created abstract oil paintings that were shown by
prestigious New York galleries, and she received a fellowship from
the MacDowell Colony and awards from the National Endowment for the
Arts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, she accompanied a friend--a concentration camp
survivor--to Auschwitz. Fishman had studied Yiddish and her Jewish
heritage in classes at Columbia University in the '70s, yet she was
unprepared for the impact of the actual scene. She took rolls of
black-and-white photographs because it was easier to look at through
the lens of a camera. When she came upon the Pond of Ashes, where the
Nazis had emptied a crematorium when the Allies arrived, she
impulsively took a handful. "I could only think that I wanted to take
these people with me," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She had bought a studio in upstate New York and thought of
planting the ashes with a tree. Her friend, novelist Bertha Harris,
said, "Everybody plants trees. Make paintings."</TE>
<TE>   Fishman ground the ashes in wax and paint to make a series of 19
canvases titled "Remembrance and Renewal." They were exhibited at the
Simon Watson Gallery in New York in 1989. (She is now represented by
Cheim &amp; Read Gallery.) The following year, there was a fire in
Fishman's studio in the country and she lost everything--paintings,
tools and slides.</TE>
<TE>   "It was devastating," she recalls huskily. "I got chronic fatigue
syndrome. I was a mess. [Abstract painter] Joan Mitchell called from
Paris and said, 'You've got to start painting right away.'" But she
found it impossible to follow Mitchell's advice.</TE>
<TE>   After a year, she still was unable to cope with the loss. The
Buddhist tenets of nonattachment were appealing. "I got involved in
Buddhism and spiritual retreats and meditation."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, she was in New Mexico and went to see celebrated
Minimalist painter Agnes Martin. "She is like sitting with the
Buddha. I realized her work is like a meditation and her writing,
which was very important to me, stems from Buddhism.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got back to New York, I went to work and started to
incorporate the things that I learned in meditation. Allowing things
to happen, not controlling, being with the moment. The basic things."</TE>
<TE>   The abstract paintings on view at the Silverman gallery are the
result of her spiritual path of the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of forcing her style to follow a certain direction, she
lets the paintings manifest as they will. "One painting will go one
way, and another will go in a different way and they are just two
strong parts of me," she says calmly. "I love them equally."</TE>

<LD>C'mon guys, your article on Shane Salerno ("Up Against His Own
Deadline," by Kevin Brass, April 7) just didn't go far enough.
Although the subtext merely implied it, you didn't take the next
logical step and state the obvious: that Shane Salerno is the Orson
Welles of the 21st century. The parallels are legion: Orson Welles
was the Hollywood enfant terrible of his time and so apparently is
Shane Salerno.</LD>
<LD>   Orson Welles gave us classics such as "Citizen Kane," "The
Magnificent Ambersons" and "Touch of Evil." Salerno has given us
equally memorable classics like "Armageddon," "Shaft" and "UC:
Undercover." Welles was inspired by the melancholy Dane. Salerno was
inspired by the not-so-melancholy Don (Johnson of "Miami Vice").</LD>
<LD>   Welles was a driven man. Salerno drove himself from Encinitas to
Los Angeles every day for a year. Welles was an extraordinary talent.
Salerno claims that being ordinary is the worse thing you can be,
which I can believe, considering the extraordinarily mind-numbing
projects he has been involved with.</LD>
<TE>   Please. Maybe I missed something, but instead of the article's
intended "young, driven man with no industry connections, faces down
Hollywood (and apparently, according to the opening photograph,
rolling surf too) to make it big" feeling I assume I was supposed to
get, I came out of it with a "young, driven man who knows how to
exploit connections gets rewarded for participating in
mediocre-at-best projects simply because they made somebody some
money."</TE>
<TE>   OK, we all know that's the bottom line, but did we really need
this puff piece to point it out?</TE>

<LD>Agustin Gurza is to be commended for his criticism of the cheap
designs that befall many Latin music CDs ("Good CD, Shame About the
Cover," April 7).</LD>
<LD>   Should we really be surprised at the labels' attitude? No matter
what the circumstances are, the Latin divisions of the big record
labels are always claiming poverty. The only artists they will spend
lots of money on are the cheesy pop groups promoted by Mexico's
imperious TV network Televisa. This is why London-based independent
label Sonic 360 recently opted to go with the "general market"
division of a big label (versus the Latin one) to distribute the
debut CD of its Monterrey, Mexico-based group Kinky in the U.S.</LD>

<LD>Ah, those wacky DVD bells and whistles! The always-useful Portuguese
subtitles, that deeply insightful cast-member commentary, those
hilarious deleted scenes you just can't believe were left on the
cutting-room floor. All full of Dolby Digital sound and 1.85:1
aspect-ratio fury--and signifying nothing ("Press Play to Access the
Future," by Richard Natale, April 7).</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the most sad and telling note was the choice of interview
subjects. Francis Ford Coppola hasn't made a worthy film since
"Apocalypse Now." Once-serious Bryan Singer has whorishly opted to
join the world of comic books. And Brett Ratner's resume consists of
Chan and Tucker eye-bugging.</LD>
<LD>   Fascinating that the views of true artists like Paul Thomas
Anderson, Todd Solondz and Neil LaBute were absent. Could it be that
Anderson and company are simply more concerned with the quality of
their films, rather than how they'll be depicted in the disc's
multiple documentariezzzzzzzzz?</LD>

<TE>   Wow! DVDs are hot, no doubt about it. I mean, what's not to like:
great picture, terrific sound, director's "special edition" cuts
oozing with added scenes and alternate endings.</TE>
<TE>   It must be hog heaven for creative and marketing teams to get a
second chance at "getting it right" or "making it better." But
Natale's otherwise excellent article left out the one reason I don't
rent or buy these sophisticated and well-intentioned discs: I hate
letterboxing.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose if I owned a 65-inch wide-screen HDTV, those odious
"black bars" would seem less distracting (then again, maybe not). But
try watching a wide-screen cut on a 27-inch TV, which is as big as I
can fit into my TV room. You need binoculars to isolate and locate
much of the panoramic shots. I hate it.</TE>
<TE>   The solution is simple: Release these "special edition" cuts in
full-screen as well; if they did, my VHS days would be surely
numbered.</TE>

come out, I will hopefully be seeing versions of those films that are
really good.</TE>

<LD>In reference to the movie "Memento," Stephen Farber writes that
"writer-director Christopher Nolan unraveled a mystery through
overlapping flashbacks that kept pushing backward in time," and that
it thus "tried something novel." But, at least to that technique, it
did not ("The Writing Was on the Wall in the '60s," April 7).</LD>
<LD>   Harold Pinter's 1978 play "Betrayal" (filmed in 1983 by director
David Hugh Jones, with Jeremy Irons, Ben Kingsley and Patricia
Hodge), used exactly the same device, and in exquisite service of the
drama, which details a love affair in reverse. The play, though
vilified in reviews at its London debut, has, through the years of
successful revivals, come to be thought of as one of Pinter's
defining works.</LD>

<LD>Given the apparent appreciation of Vin Scully's remarkable talent and
condemnation of almost all other local sport announcers, I was
wondering how is it that Paul Brownfield forgot to pass some judgment
on Steve Physioc, the voice of the Angels, as well as an announcer
for Fox Sports' Pac-10 games ("They Shoot, They Bore," March 31).
Physioc makes a mundane layup or a short gain down the middle quite
exciting by just the way he calls his college games; with the Angels,
often his team in the booth was a lot more interesting than the one
on the field.</LD>

<LD>As a psychologist who specializes in and teaches a university course
on the psychology of modern music, I appreciate Steve Hochman's
review of Neil Young's "Are You Passionate?" (April 7).</LD>
<LD>   The cathartic value of music can't be valued enough in this age of
new rage. But there's a marked difference between vomiting up
emotions like the band Disturbed does so disturbingly, or delivering
those same bottled-up emotions with both grit and grace.</LD>
<LD>   When it comes to the latter, Neil Young is king.</LD>

<HD>Chaos, Refined</HD>
<DH>For more than a decade, the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion has
retained a basic punk-rock spirit while adding shape to its raw blend
of pop styles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A loud, rude sound blasts out the open door of the El Rey Theatre,
spilling onto Wilshire Boulevard and mingling with the noise of cars
and buses roaring past. It's sound-check time for New York punk-blues
trio the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, and singer-guitarist Spencer is
messing around with his trademark theremin, a vintage electronic
instrument.</LD>
<LD>   "It can be louder in both of these," he tells the sound man,
indicating the monitors at his feet. "Just let it rip."</LD>
<LD>   Spencer, guitarist Judah Bauer and drummer Russell Simins have
been letting rip with their raw blend of punk, garage, blues, funk
and hip-hop for 11 years now. On "Plastic Fang," the band's first new
collection in four years (due April 23 from Matador Records), its
chaotic music is more refined than ever. But the group's style
remains singularly gritty at a time when pop critics and fans have
become more enamored of this kind of dirtier sound, from pop-punkers
the Strokes to garage-blues duo the White Stripes to fuzz-rockers
B.R.M.C.</LD>
<TE>   "It's nice to hear rock bands with more of a punky vibe and style,
like the Strokes," Simins says, sitting in the band's tour van on a
side street near the theater. "The Strokes are more pop than we are,
but when I hear them on the radio, rather than just that corporate
grunge-sounding [stuff], I can relate. If it makes way for something
more like what we are, that's great."</TE>
<TE>   Slumped on a bench seat in the group's van, Spencer doesn't
exactly look the devoted-dad type, with his extra-wide mutton-chop
sideburns and creature-of-the-night pallor. But he is most interested
in finding a toy store in hopes of locating some elusive plaything
for his 4-year-old son with wife Cristina Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-'80s, he and Martinez were in the D.C.-to-New York
noise-punk group Pussy Galore, in which Spencer began his
abrasive/minimalist antics. After Pussy Galore broke up, Spencer
formed the Blues Explosion in 1991 with Simins and Bauer. (Martinez
sings with the band Boss Hog, of which Spencer is also a member.)</TE>
<TE>   At first the Blues Explosion's music was as raw and anarchic as
Pussy Galore's had been. But soon the trio grafted on some song
structure (not to mention some funk), and 1993's "Extra Width," its
first Matador release, got more attention, thanks to a video on MTV's
weekly alt-rock showcase "120 Minutes."</TE>
<TE>   The following year, "Orange" garnered critical raves. By the time
1996's "Now I Got Worry" and 1998's "Acme" were released, Matador had
made its now-defunct distribution deal with Capitol Records, and the
Blues Explosion was practically a major-label sellout by default. But
not really.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the group is no stranger to misconceptions. For example,
despite its name, and the obvious inspiration of classic blues' naked
spirit, it's a rock 'n' roll band, not a blues act.</TE>
<TE>   "We're basically just a punk-rock band," Simins says. "Blues is an
influence, and people [emphasize] it because of the name. We do like
blues and are into the heritage of the blues, but that's just one
aspect."</TE>
<TE>   "Now it seems to me that there's more acceptance or greater
respect," Spencer says of attitudes toward the Blues Explosion's
style. Sept. 11 "put everything in perspective," he adds, deadpanning
so flatly that it takes a minute to comprehend his wry tweaking of
blues purists and pop culture's overuse of the attacks as a filter
through which to view everything.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, what may turn off some listeners even more than the band's
irreverent mangling of the blues is that its work has an archness
that sounds like a total put-on to some ears. The presence of the
squalling theremin alone is enough to raise suspicions of
kitsch-fueled caricature.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly there is humor behind the monster-movie theme in the
song titles and artwork of "Plastic Fang." Yet there's nothing ironic
about the funkiness of such tunes as the sexy gothic romp "She Said,"
the N'Awlins-swaggering "Hold On" or even the confessional, pulsating
"Killer Wolf."</TE>
<TE>   Blues and gospel motifs of sin and redemption play large in that
tune as well as in such selections as "Mean Heart." Spencer's deep,
soulful voice--an animal thing itself--matches the various elemental
moods, morphing from an elastic wail to a low growl to a guttural
scream.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Plastic Fang" still has the rolling-jam spirit of
earlier collections, the more consistent song structure makes it
sound something like a young, 21st century Rolling Stones, a record
that possibly could propel the Blues Explosion from cult jam to wider
recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who wants to can join the party," Spencer says. "But I
don't think we're gonna change what we do just to court" attention.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, none of the tinkering the Explosion has done from album to
album has altered the core feeling of its music.</TE>
<TE>   This time out, the trio wanted to indulge its fascination with
rock history. The band welcomed producer Steve Jordan's suggestions
of bringing in such guests as Funkadelic keyboardist Bernie Worrell,
who plays organ on "Hold On," and Dr. John, who, although a renowned
pianist, gets back to his '50s session roots by contributing guitar
to the same tune.</TE>
<TE>   Having guest musicians who represent the R&amp;B and funk strains of
the Blues Explosion's interests also seems important to Bauer, who
grows impatient with focusing on the blues. After all, he notes,
"Plastic Fang" also bears the equally distinctive influence of early
rocker Roy Buchanan's harmonic dissonance, not to mention the cleaner
country stylings of Bakersfield-scene guitarists Don Rich and Roy
Nichols.</TE>
<TE>   Hmmm. A blend of country and blues? Smells like rock 'n' roll,
indeed.</TE>

<HD>Grohl Says Foo-ey to Breakup Rumors</HD>

<LD>Are the Foos through?</LD>
<LD>   A wave of panic coursed through offices of RCA Records, which is
awaiting the fourth album from consistent million-sellers the Foo
Fighters. Reports had it that leader Dave Grohl was putting the band
on indefinite hiatus to become the full-time drummer for the band
Queens of the Stone Age.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, a wave of elation hit Interscope Records, which
is awaiting the third album from the Queens, which have yet to
achieve a big breakthrough.</LD>
<TE>   Hold on, says Grohl. The reports are only partly accurate. Grohl
tells Pop Eye that he and the Foo Fighters are taking a break before
finishing their fourth album (now scheduled for fall release) and
that he will be doing some shows with the Queens. Grohl has been
recording with the Inland Empire band for its upcoming third album
(due in late spring), and he played drums at a recent Troubadour show
by the group. It was his first full concert behind a drum kit since
the 1994 death of Kurt Cobain ended Nirvana.</TE>
<TE>   "The Foos are taking a break from recording after four months and
12 songs," Grohl said in an e-mail. "There's a few songs that still
need some tracking, but over half the album is completed and mixed.
We've maintained a pretty solid work ethic over the last seven years
and thought it might be a good idea to step back from the album,
relax, and take our time finishing. No big whoop. No state of
emergency.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true that I'm joining Queens for some shows. Don't know how
many, don't know for how long. That doesn't mean that the Foos are
breaking up, doesn't mean that the album is over. I'm still the
singer for the Foos, first and foremost."</TE>
<TE>   Grohl's two jobs will be showcased at the Coachella Festival in
Indio, with the Queens scheduled to perform April 27 and the Foo
Fighters co-headlining April 28.</TE>
<TE>   "Come out to Coachella," Grohl wrote in his e-mail. "That says it
all right there. I think I'm the luckiest guy in the world that I can
do both at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   That Grohl might want to step out of the frontman's spotlight is
no surprise after a stretch marked by several unwelcome distractions.
The Foo Fighters' European tour last summer came to an abrupt halt
when drummer Taylor Hawkins was hospitalized after a drug overdose.
In recent months, Grohl and ex-Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic have
been engaged in a nasty public battle with Cobain's widow, Courtney
Love, over control of Nirvana's recordings and song catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reasons for playing with the Queens, the double duty
gets an endorsement from RCA executives.</TE>
<TE>   "Dave's involvement with Queens of the Stone Age is something that
he's fortunate to do because he loves the band and happens to be one
of the world's best drummers," says RCA Vice President of A&amp;R Bruce
Flohr. "At the end of the day, RCA Records and his management team
support Dave's musical vision to do whatever he wants."</TE>
<TE>   AMERICAN(ISH) GIRL: Beth Orton's voice has been compared to that
of Sandy Denny, and her mix of melodic ballad styles and electronic
touches has been considered the successor to the English folk-rock
tradition. But Orton's upcoming album, "Daybreaker," due from
Astralwerks Records in June, has a distinct Americana cast, with
Orton dueting with Emmylou Harris and Ryan Adams, who wrote the music
for one song.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like Nashville," says Orton, although the album was
recorded in London. "I don't know why. It's a complete coincidence."</TE>
<TE>   Orton had long admired Harris, and they met in 1997 when both were
on the Lilith Fair tour.</TE>
<TE>   "On the last day of the tour, I gave her a necklace," Orton says.
"Then when I went to see her in London a few months ago when she was
doing her anti-landmines concert, I walked into the dressing room and
it just happened she was wearing that necklace. I had been scared to
ask her to sing on my album, but I took that as a sign and asked her
to sing and she did."</TE>
<TE>   Having heard Adams' subdued 2000 release, "Heartbreaker," Orton
was a fan of his before last year's acclaimed "Gold" album. "I adored
that album and was looking for someone to do backup vocals on the
song 'Concrete Sky,' and he seemed like a good choice," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "We met up last year....He did a vocal part and it was wonderful,
then said, 'I've got a piano part, and a guitar part.' And then he
had this song he said I'd be perfect for and played it for me and we
did it in one take."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, veteran L.A. drummer Jim Keltner was recruited for
one song, and Orton cites Ry Cooder's atmospheric score from the
movie "Paris, Texas" as a big influence on the album.</TE>
<TE>   But "Daybreaker" is hardly an all-American effort. English
producer Ben Watt oversaw most of the sessions, and regular
collaborators the Chemical Brothers mixed the title song. Orton also
notes that the score to "Blade Runner," by Greek-born electronic
musician Vangelis, was as much on her mind as Cooder's work.</TE>
<TE>   Orton will preview the album in U.S. clubs in May and June before
returning to England to play on the outdoor festival circuit. She's
due at the House of Blues in West Hollywood on May 28.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Following up the ad campaign featuring Pink's "Get
the Party Started," the National Basketball Assn. is producing spots
with Lenny Kravitz (his song "Dig In") and the Baha Men ("Move It
Like This") to run through the playoffs, which end in June. The
campaign will tip off with a Baha Men performance at the NBA store in
New York on Thursday....</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Berry and Little Richard, who recently toured together, will
be joined by a third '50s rock pioneer, Bo Diddley, to receive BMI
Icon Awards as part of the royalties collection and distribution
organization's 50th annual BMI Pop Awards. The invitation-only,
black-tie event will be held May 14 at the Regent Beverly Wilshire
Hotel....</TE>
<TE>   After mostly lying low in Hawaii and San Francisco since the death
of Jerry Garcia in 1995, former Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann
will bring his band TriChromes to Southern California in June for its
first shows outside the Bay Area. Dates include June 29 at the House
of Blues in Anaheim and June 30 at the Sunset Strip House of Blues.</TE>

<LD>   KRONOS QUARTET</LD>
<LD>   "Nuevo"</LD>
<TE>   Nonesuch</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, it takes outsiders to find fresh perspectives on a
musical culture that natives take for granted. On this brilliant
album, Argentine rock producer Gustavo Santaolalla teams with Kronos,
the experimental U.S. string quartet, to create a revealing,
impressionistic portrait of Mexican music, from the corrido to the
classical.</TE>
<TE>   Though the 14 tracks span a century, the album's innovative
interpretations earn its title, which means "new." Most of its bold
arrangements are by Osvaldo Golijov, the Argentina-born composer and
longtime collaborator of the San Francisco quartet, which has made a
career of cross-cultural explorations.</TE>
<TE>   Like the deliberately off-key country band in Beethoven's
"Pastoral" Symphony, the group opens playfully with screechy, wobbly
strings on "El Sinaloense," evoking a rough-hewn rural band on this
bawdy bar tune. Far from typical tourist fare, "Nuevo" reaches deep
and wide into the country's repertoire for genuine vintage gems
(Alberto Dominguez's "Perfidia"), offbeat novelties (Juan Garcia
Esquivel's "Mini Skirt") and complex, progressive works (Silvestre
Revueltas' "Sensemaya," Cafe Tacuba's "12/12"). Agustin Lara's
mournful torch song "Se Me Hizo Facil" is even more soulful in this
exquisitely slow version, with its courtly waltz crescendo.</TE>
<TE>   Interlacing the tracks are the hypnotic street sounds of Mexico
City, where musical director David Harrington discovered a one-armed
minstrel eliciting improbably perfect melodies by blowing on an ivy
leaf, sampled here on "Perfidia" (street recordings were made by
co-producer Anibal Kerpel). Like good cultural anthropologists, the
Kronos musicians have created an enlightening musical document by
keeping their ears close to the ground.</TE>

<TE>   SHERYL CROW</TE>
<TE>   "C'mon, C'mon"</TE>
<TE>   A&amp;M</TE>
<TE>   Crow's first studio album since 1998's "The Globe Sessions" (due
in stores Tuesday) mixes several songs that wrestle with the price of
fame and celebrity with her usual exposes on making and remedying
lousy choices in love.</TE>
<TE>   Although she writes and sings mostly as the observations of one
person to another, it's hard not to read many as inner conversations
between the struggling artist Crow was a little more than a decade
ago and the rock star and media celebrity she's become.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve McQueen" celebrates the rebel spirit as she bemoans its
disappearance. "Soak Up the Sun" is a breezy paean to simple
pleasures that contains the album's most concise philosophical
expression: "It's not having what you want/It's wanting what you've
got."</TE>
<TE>   One upside in Crow's world of getting what you want is that you
get to pal around in the studio with people like Emmylou Harris,
Stevie Nicks, Lenny Kravitz, Don Henley and Liz Phair--even Gwyneth
Paltrow adds her voice to one track.</TE>
<TE>   Musically, Crow skillfully taps her classic-rock influences,
adding some fleeting hip-hop hues for color, without moving them
forward much beyond a surprise modulation here or there.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Lewis</TE>

<TE>   STEW</TE>
<TE>   "The Naked Dutch Painter</TE>
<TE>   ... and Other Songs"</TE>
<TE>   Smile</TE>
<TE>   With his second solo outing, the leader of L.A.'s offbeat popsters
the Negro Problem continues to explore his sensitive side. These
quirkily evocative portraits of interesting people and defining
moments have a kind of stealth catchiness. That is, you may find
yourself humming along even while wondering how the heck Stew comes
up with this stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the experiences he recounts are so alien. The title song
has an understated self-reproach that is both hilarious and poignant.
The sense of infatuation in the soulful groove "Reeling" and the joy
of a reunion in "Love Is Coming Through the Door" are simple,
familiar feelings recounted in a poetic but unpretentious way.
Indeed, any given instant here comes across as palpably honest, even
when the material is as high-concept as "The Drug Suite," a
three-part tale connecting discrete casual-use scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   The collection was in part recorded live at the AlterKnit Lounge
during a residency last summer, and although the album is nicely
polished, the concert setting gives it an intimate, casual feeling
that keeps the focus on Stew's eye for detail and kaleidoscopic pop
style. And despite his wry wit, he sings as warmly as any sincere
crooner--rather like the title character, who seems so aloof but
ultimately reveals all. Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Deepsky, "In Silico," Kinetic. The L.A. (via New Mexico) duo
of J. Scott Gianquita and Jason Blum has worked with the likes of BT,
Carl Cox and Sandra Collins. The pair brings all that experience to
its savvy full-length debut, mixing old-school style (the '80s
techno-pop of "Mansion World") with progressive dance beats (the
funky "Atia") for a techno album that satisfies brain and body.</TE>

<HD>Dance's True Partner: Music</HD>
<DH>In the 20th century, dancers usually played second fiddle
to the sounds they performed to. Now, collaboration is challenging
old assumptions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an intimate performance space at the Skirball Cultural Center,
American cellist Walter Haman is playing a complex, turbulent passage
from Allan Hovhaness' solo suite "Yakamochi" while Venezuelan modern
dancer Jose Navas stands behind him. Suddenly, Navas gently touches
Haman's chest with one hand and covers the musician's eyes with the
other, closing his own eyes as the music goes on.</LD>
<LD>   A dancer who stops dancing in order to channel music through touch
isn't exactly the norm in the dance world, nor is a musician who
assumes the active role in a meditative pas de deux. But the daring
Haman/Navas Project in February was just one recent example of
choreographers and musicians testing new collaborative relationships
through increasingly radical experiments.</LD>
<LD>   Loretta Livingston's improvisational "Dances for White Rooms" at
the Luckman Theatre last May also involved physical interplay between
dancers and musicians, while Bill T. Jones' "WorldWithout/In" at UCLA
last month put instrumentalists from the Chamber Music Society of
Lincoln Center on stage as performers and witnesses to a masked
neo-Expressionist ritual of death and rebirth.</LD>
<TE>   Obviously tap-dancing and many other rhythm-based dance forms
around the world have always cultivated the interaction of dancers
and musicians. But Euro-American concert dance has traditionally
followed a different set of rules.</TE>
<TE>   Up through the 19th century, classical music composed for the
concert hall remained off limits to ballet; instead, house composers
supplied accompaniments to order. Some of them were masters in their
own right, but their music often served the dance so slavishly that
any ballet scores with independent interest (Tchaikovsky's, for
example) were initially judged to be too symphonic or heavy--a.k.a.
undanceable.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Isadora Duncan and other innovators at the turn of the
century who were determined to dance to the great concert-hall
classics. Their achievements proved revolutionary but ended by
replacing one form of servitude with another: Experiments in music
visualization and the symphonic ballet led to an assumption that
dance must serve music.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the achievements and influence of such neoclassic
masters as George Balanchine and Frederick Ashton seemed to close the
debate once and for all: Abstract, non-narrative choreography that
revealed the beauties of the greatest music in Western culture became
the Holy Grail of dance art.</TE>
<TE>   Even Merce Cunningham and his postmodern separate-but-equal
stance--with music and choreography created without reference to one
another and only juxtaposed in performance--made no real dent in the
belief of artists, critics and audiences that dance's job involves
interpreting the sounds coming from the orchestra pit or tape
machine.</TE>
<TE>   Those choreographers who rebelled against this status quo tended
to use music as sonic filler or mock the very idea of dancing to
it--German iconoclast Pina Bausch, for instance--and their work
inspired the critical label dance-theater to separate them from the
music-dominated dance world. The governing principle in that world at
the turn of our century remained the Balanchine ideal of seeing the
music.</TE>
<TE>   Since Balanchine's death in 1983, no one has been more dedicated
to enforcing musical primacy than Mark Morris, a choreographer
disarmingly contemporary in his inclusion of all sorts of bodies and
all sorts of movement in his work but increasingly conservative in
musicality.</TE>
<TE>   As Morris' methods have hardened into formulas, he has become an
index to the growing emptiness and predictability of post-Balanchine
music visualization. In vocal scores, for example, you can expect
Morris to pull gestural images from the lyrics: imaginary sipping
during the song "A Cup of Coffee, a Sandwich and You" from his 1998
"Dancing Honeymoon" suite or wing-fluttering during "Two Little
Bluebirds" from the same work.</TE>
<TE>   The effect can be playful and childlike the first two or three
times. But it soon proves merely an automatic response, especially
when the lack of any deep engagement with the music extends to
serious scores. "Sang-Froid," from 2000, for instance, trivializes
Chopin, the inspiration for a whole pantheon of 20th century dance
masters from Mikhail Fokine to Jerome Robbins. As usual, Morris uses
dance motifs to structurally diagram the music, but for all their
expertise, his dancers look cued into action, moving to Chopin-counts
like puppets.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, interpretive musicality survives with greater freshness
in the work of a few up-and-coming choreographers such as Sean
Curran. At the Alex Theatre in October, Curran's plotless "Symbolic
Logic" showpiece reflected the style of recordings by Indiapop singer
Sheila Chandra through walks, stances and hand-poses suggesting
Indian classical dance--an idiom familiar to Morris. But Curran's
inspired spatial invention--his wheel formations and multiple layers
of dancers moving with astonishing torque and precision to chanted
rhythm-syllables--made dance a full partner of the music and then
some.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the process of putting on a CD and creating a dance
equivalent isn't taken for granted anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Taylor's recent "Black Tuesday" for American Ballet Theatre
used songs of the Great Depression to satirize relentlessly upbeat
popular entertainment. In other words, it made dancing refute its
music, insisting, despite the accompaniment, that there was never
anything remotely cheery or colorful about poverty in the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   When postmodern pioneer Trisha Brown brought her company to UCLA
in February to perform "El Trilogy," her first choreography to jazz,
she didn't impose a preset interpretive method on the music, a la
Morris, but rather let it take her in new creative directions.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing random noises and musicians' coughs in the taped
accompaniment, for example, she sought a kind of documentary movement
that would form a contrast with the company's formal dancing. Her
solution: sudden heavy falls to the floor by one dancer after
another, falls that seemed accidental at first, like the coughs, but
soon developed into unexpected texture and punctuation in the piece.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there's a generation of choreographers who insist on the
right to hear familiar music in a new way--their way. They include
artists such as Matthew Bourne, who heard feral violence in
Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" and echoes of World War II in Prokofiev's
"Cinderella." Their work has not only helped reinvigorate musicality
but also the whole narrative tradition in dance.</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake: George Balanchine's see-the-music ballets may
well constitute the greatest dance repertory we will ever encounter.
But we don't expect new composers to pursue Mozart's priorities
simply because he was great, and a succession of mediocre Balanchine
imitators has definitively proved that his genius isn't transferable
through emulation.</TE>
<TE>   Like the cycles of male and female dominance of the dance
repertory, the chicken-and-the-egg question of music and dance will
be redefined in every epoch. The current trend toward making the two
arts a love match has already brought us exciting adventures in
collaboration and, by breaking down traditional roles and
assumptions, promises to renew the oldest relationship in live
performance.</TE>

<KH>Movies: Surprise Hits</KH>
<HD>G is for Grosses</HD>
<DH>For years, parents and theater owners have been demanding
family-friendly films. Finally, the box office has made their case
for them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood, the world capital of sex and violence, has discovered its
next big thing: family. The industry made its biggest profits last
year from G- and PG-rated movies, and plans to fill the nation's
screens in the next few years with even more princesses, monsters,
talking animals, bright schoolkids and scrappy ballplayers.</LD>
<LD>   It's not hard to see why. This year's biggest surprise, 20th
Century Fox's "Ice Age," a computer-animated story of prehistoric
animal bonding, has grossed more than $140 million in just four weeks
of release. Other successful family films, such as Disney's G-rated
"The Rookie," released last month, and its earlier hit "Snow Dogs,"
are pushing the box office to a record start this year.</LD>
<LD>   This follows blockbuster family films in 2001, when three of the
top four highest-grossing films ("Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone," "Shrek" and "Monsters, Inc.") were rated G or PG. The
live-action low-profile feature "The Princess Diaries" surprised its
makers at Disney with more than $100 million at the box office, while
Miramax's "Spy Kids" was a breakout hit that inspired a sequel (and a
flock of imitators).</LD>
<TE>   Feeding the burgeoning family film market through 2002 are such
films as "The Other Side of Heaven" (Excel Entertainment), "Hey,
Arnold" (Nickelodeon), "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"
(DreamWorks), "Curious George" (Universal), Disney's "Lilo &amp; Stitch,"
"Country Bears," "Treasure Planet" and "Tuck Everlasting," Fox's
"Like Mike" and the sequels "Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams"
(Miramax) and "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" (Warner
Bros.)</TE>
<TE>   If studios needed any further convincing about the potential of
the family film market, "Ice Age" should erase any doubts. The
computer-animated film wasn't released by either of the animation
powerhouses--Disney or DreamWorks--and came out at a historically
slow time of the year at the box office. Its opening weekend gross of
$49 million was a shock to many in the business, including Fox.</TE>
<TE>   "Releasing a family film in March is not common," said John
Fithian, president of the National Assn. of Theatre Owners. "And it
not just worked but it blew the socks off a record."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Harper, vice chairman of 20th Century Fox noted that a decade
ago, family movies were either for kids or the mothers who decided
what the kids would watch, he said. The target audiences had time to
discover the films since they ran for about a month.</TE>
<TE>   ''We are now in an era when practically every weekend is an event
weekend,'' and event movies need to be accessible to everyone, Harper
said. Over time, the success of movies like ''Toy Story'' and
''Shrek'' demonstrated that movies about children, even animated
ones, could appeal to fathers and teenagers as well as mothers and
small children. Industry executives and observers attribute the
interest in family-oriented fare to a combination of factors: The
growing sophistication and popularity of computer animation, the
federal government's increased scrutiny of marketing adult fare to
under-age audiences, a more conservative national mood after
Columbine and Sept. 11, and a new generation of parent filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We've become absorbed with family values," said Glenn Ross,
president of Artisan's Family Home Entertainment, which last month
expanded its video operations to start distributing family films in
theaters. Producers are no different from other American parents, he
said. "If you produce a family film, you can say, 'Look what Daddy
made.'" The division will release its first film, the animated
"Jonah--A Veggie Tales Movie," in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine economics professor Arthur De Vany and UCI colleague W.
David Walls will publish in July a study in the quarterly academic
publication Journal of Business that shows G-rated films are less
risky and have greater success rates than R-rated films even in
theatrical runs. "The paradox is that people think Hollywood makes
R-rated movies out of concern for the bottom line," De Vany said. In
fact, he said, the truth is just the opposite: Hollywood could have
increased its profits by producing more G-rated movies.</TE>
<TE>   That message slowly seems to be getting through to Hollywood.
"Studios have already decided that they're going to make more G, PG
and PG-13 films," said a market researcher for the major studios who
didn't want to be named. Often criticized in conservative political
and cultural quarters for ignoring family values, studios are now
vying for hard-to-find quality material with gentle themes and
universal appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Even Miramax, a studio built on grown-up dramas, announced
recently that it is forging into the family market with a series of
films based on popular children's books such as "Ella Enchanted." The
company calls them "The Teddy Projects."</TE>
<TE>   The studio was impressed with the success of "Spy Kids," written
and directed by Robert Rodriguez ("El Mariachi"), which grossed $113
million for its sister label, Dimension Films. "We're looking at
developing more of these types of films, no question," said Bob
Osher, co-president of production at Miramax. "We will be bringing
the Miramax sensibility to some family films."</TE>
<TE>   In 2003, Miramax is scheduled to make a film from the best-selling
book series about a young criminal mastermind, "Artemis Fowl." New
Line Cinema and Scholastic Entertainment have acquired rights to the
award-winning trilogy "His Dark Materials," about a parallel universe
where humans share souls with animals.</TE>
<TE>   By their very nature, family-friendly films can attract larger
audiences than more adult fare. That's one reason some filmmakers are
willing to edit their R-rated films to get a PG-13, said Jack
Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, the
organization responsible for rating films. "And most would rather get
a PG than PG-13," he said. "Your audience potential is larger, no
question about it."</TE>
<TE>   Producer Barry Mendel ("The Royal Tennenbaums," "The Sixth Sense")
notes that it's not just in theaters that family films do well. In
the aftermarket of videos and DVDs, a G-rated film will sell up to
five times as many units as an R-rated film, Mendel said, as parents
search for suitable films for their children to watch at home.</TE>
<TE>   The increased interest in family films has delighted the nation's
theater owners, who have been calling for a higher percentage of
family-friendly films for several years. "My theater-owner members
cry out every year for more family-friendly films. They're the ones
selling pictures," said the National Assn. of Theatre Owners'
Fithian.</TE>
<TE>   Only 13% of films are rated G or PG, but they have made up 20% or
more of the box office gross for the past several years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fithian suggests one reason filmmakers are reluctant to make more
family films is that they lack prestige. "It's just not cool to make
family films," he said. A G rating, though appealing to parents
wanting to take young children safely to the movies, can also drive
away many in the teen and adult audience who assume it means the
movie will be too bland or soft. "You hear a lot of talk that ratings
affect who comes into the theater," said Wes Craven, director of
"Scream." "You might make a very interesting film and a G rating
would keep adults and young adults away."</TE>
<TE>   If there has been a G-rated stigma, it too is changing. During the
past few years, respected directors known for their hard-edged films
have turned to family fare. David Lynch, David Mamet and Craven
directed "The Straight Story" (rated G), "The Winslow Boy" (rated G)
and "Music of the Heart" (rated PG), respectively. "Spy Kids"
director Rodriguez made his name with the bloody "El Mariachi" and
its sequel.</TE>
<TE>   Since Nickelodeon acquired rights this year to "A Series of
Unfortunate Events," author Lemony Snicket's 13-book series about the
adventures of three orphans, the project has attracted several A-list
directors, said Julia Pistor, senior vice president of Nickelodeon
Movies.</TE>
<TE>   Some executives resist the notion that people choose a movie based
on its rating, arguing instead that audiences simply respond to good
storytelling. "People want to see good movies," said Dick Cook,
chairman of Walt Disney Studios. He noted that Disney did not aim to
make "The Rookie" a G-rated film, he said. "We knew it was a great
story and one that we wanted to tell."</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of family films "goes through cycles," Cook said.
"Sometimes the films don't have universal appeal and other times they
just seem to be hitting on all cylinders. We're going through that
period now."</TE>
<TE>   Edwin Catmull, president of Pixar Animation Studios, noted that
when family film turn into blockbuster hits, "people have a hard time
believing it. They had to have something edgy and push some bounds to
prove something for some reason."</TE>
<TE>   "When 'Toy Story' came out [in 1995], it was very successful," he
said. "It was a surprise. Nobody knew who we were. People were hungry
for these kinds of films."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the real reason filmmakers have not made more family films
is that they are notoriously hard to do well. "How do you do a movie
that is simple enough for a child yet sophisticated enough for an
adult to feel engaged by? In trying to serve two such different
masters, you end up with a lot of bad scripts," producer Mendel said.
"When somebody does a film like 'Babe' or 'Toy Story,' people in the
industry bow down to that."</TE>
<TE>   UCI's De Vany said that while studios often talk about market
demographics and penetration, "they have no clue. You can't predict
these things."</TE>
<TE>   In the Journal of Business study, De Vany and Walls studied more
than 2,000 films from 1984 to 1994 and found G-rated movies dominated
other ratings categories in box office and video revenues. A separate
analysis of films dating from 1994 to 2000 produced identical
results.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an industry where learning is difficult," De Vany said. Once
a certain type of movie succeeds, other filmmakers tend to jump on
the bandwagon. When a few fail, they jump off.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to copy a successful movie, though common, is a strategy
that's bound to fail, some executives said. "When Disney did well in
the late '80s with 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'The Little Mermaid' and
'Aladdin,' then all the other studios jumped in," Catmull said. "That
splurge of things did more damage than good. Most of those projects
failed. They were not about telling stories, they were about copying

<TE>   "The next thing that happened was the effects revolution.
'Jurassic Park' came out using digital effects. Suddenly everyone
felt like they had to have major effects. A raiding war went on for a
few years until it collapsed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Catmull said Pixar films aim for an audience of children and
adults by mixing animation that appeals to children and verbal play
for adults. "The reality is children live in an adult world. They
hear things all the time that are fairly sophisticated. If you play
down to children, they might find it amusing the first time. The
second time, they're done. We make films adults can enjoy and
children can watch but reach for, find meaning and see multiple
times."</TE>
<TE>   But he said the primary key to success is finding a creative team
that works well together to produce something original.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the recent interest in family films by the studios,
Hollywood is unlikely to reduce its production of adult dramas,
Artisan's Ross said. "They're just making a more balanced plate, with
a portion of a little of each."</TE>

<TE>   Here are the top 10 movies of all time at the box office (as of
last Sunday), measured by their domestic gross in millions of
dollars. Of the top 100, 22 are rated R, but you have to go all the
way down to No. 25, 1984's "Beverly Hills Cop," to find the first of
only four R-rated movies among the top 50.</TE>

<LD>Imagine a train wreck that scatters passengers across the landscape.
Paramedics arrive and begin loading the injured onto stretchers. But
when anyone screams out in pain, "No! Don't touch me!" the medics nod
compassionately and leave that person sprawled amid the rocks and
cactuses.</LD>
<LD>   A similar scene has been unfolding on the urban landscape for the
last 40 years. People with severe mental illness, tossed from state
hospitals, have landed on public sidewalks and in wretched urban
encampments. And no one helps them because they say they don't want
help.</LD>
<LD>   It's time for society to reevaluate this perverse arrangement.</LD>
<TE>   Senate Health and Human Services Committee Chairwoman Deborah
Ortiz, a Sacramento Democrat, is presently deciding when, or whether,
to schedule a vote on a bill by Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis)
that would give authorities more power to impose treatment.</TE>
<TE>   AB 1421, or "Laura's law," would let judges compel some severely
mentally ill people to accept supervised outpatient care. A person
whose voices were telling him to hurt himself or someone else, for
example, could be forced to attend counseling sessions with a
psychologist or psychiatrist and to take prescribed stabilizing
medications.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is named after Laura Wilcox, a 19-year-old high school
valedictorian killed along with two other people in Northern
California last year by a man whose mental illness went untreated.
Existing laws had left his family, the police and mental health
professionals impotent to intervene.</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians have defeated the bill twice now, by persuading
legislators--notably Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San
Francisco)--that no one should be forced to take medications against
his or her will. Thomson's bill, however, has been amended numerous
times to provide comprehensive civil rights protections. It would let
judges order treatment only after mental health professionals, social
workers and family members had carefully deliberated and decided that
without intervention a severely mentally ill person would be at
''high risk'' of injury to himself or others.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, society must guarantee that no patient is ever again
subjected to the sort of abuse that was rampant in the psychiatric
"snake pits" of the late 1950s and early '60s. But those who focus
solely on worries about mistreatment need to understand something
that the families of people with severe mental illness and other
activists pushing for Laura's law know all too well: that lack of
treatment can be just as bad.</TE>
<TE>   Couple this shared compassion for a vulnerable population with the
fear among people whose children or spouses have been attacked by
individuals who needed medical care and it becomes very clear why
California needs to restore a balance between rights and
responsibilities. This was lost when civil libertarians passed laws
that not only liberated mistreated patients but granted some the new
freedom to harm themselves and others in a never-ending cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Only a small percentage of people with serious mental illness are
the least bit violent. But since Laura Wilcox's death in January 2001
the state's failure to give assertive treatment to those who need it
has led to many other tragedies.</TE>
<TE>   Just days after a man suffering from severe paranoia shot Wilcox,
a trucker known to become erratic when he wasn't on medications
rammed his 18-wheeler into the state Capitol and died in the crash.
In San Bernardino, a man with paranoid schizophrenia killed his
mother on Mother's Day. And last month San Diego police killed a man
who had been released that morning by a psychiatric hospital without
mandatory follow-up treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and the California Peace
Officers Assn. recently threw their important support behind Laura's
law. Ortiz, her colleagues in the Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis
should do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Term limits will push Assemblywoman Thomson out of state office
this fall. It may be a while before another politician has the
courage to pick up this cause--one that is all too easy for so-called
leaders to ignore. The time to pass this important, long-delayed bill
is now.</TE>
<TE>   To Take Action: Call or write state Sen. Deborah Ortiz, (916)
445-7807, the chairwoman of the Senate Health and Human Services
Committee, where the bill will face its biggest challenge. Or write
to your own senator, whose address you can find on the Web at
www.sen. ca.gov.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time there was a society where real people answered their
own office telephones. They lifted the receiver, curious to know who
was calling. "Hello?" they said. They talked to the caller, back and
forth, just like a conversation. When done, they hung up and thought
that was normal.</LD>
<LD>   If the call recipient was absent, a co-worker jotted a message on
a small piece of pink paper. "While You Were Out" slips accumulated
until the person came back and politely returned the calls. If calls
came after closing, no one answered; that was the signal no one was
there. So you tried tomorrow.</LD>
<LD>   Almost 30 years ago Gordon Matthews was in Colorado attempting to
call a Dallas co-worker. He phoned. No answer. He phoned again. No
answer again. Matthews noticed a nearby pile of phone messages. "When
I see something that irritates me," he said later, "I invent
something to fix it." From those unanswered rings, the pink reminders
and Matthews' fertile mind came one of the most amazing, helpful,
annoying, frustrating, timesaving, maddening and ubiquitous modern
conveniences: voicemail.</LD>
<TE>   Like most inventions, it solved problems and created others.
Voicemail revolutionized American workplace communications. It
altered business manners. It added to the depersonalization of life,
allowing us to do more while relating less. Envisioned as an
efficient way for employees to communicate, voicemail evolved into an
all-encompassing corporate communications network, answering phones,
delivering messages to multiple parties, forwarding and storing
messages, creating personal reminders. It also developed the dubious
ability to route callers through a baffling array of recorded options
to save staff money and test the patience of the most loyal
customers. (To learn more about voicemail's inventor, push 1 and keep
reading.)</TE>
<TE>   Most important to some minds, voicemail enables millions of
Americans to deal with each other without actually talking. If you
time a call properly after-hours, you can do all your business
talking by yourself on a machine with no threat of contradiction or
personal interaction. Someone may be doing that to you right now at
the office.</TE>
<TE>   Three dozen patents are held in the name of voicemail's inventor,
who said he never approved of the impersonal voicemail permutations.
His own home phone number in Texas is unlisted. Matthews died
recently of stroke complications at the age of 65. The office
voicemail message with that news got erased soon after his February
death. But the impact of the little-known man's mind on our lives
will be stored much longer than 60 days. (Push 2 to repeat this

<LD>Who writes the laws by which the International Criminal Court will
judge people ("Global Court Near Despite U.S. Rebuff," April 11)?
Will it operate on an ex post facto basis, which is expressly
forbidden by the U.S. Constitution? Is there any process by which a
mischievous judge can be removed? How long are the terms of office?
Is there a confirmation process for appointees? It seems to me that
this court is a danger rather than a safeguard.</LD>

<TE>   The Bush administration is right to oppose an international
criminal tribunal. Although the U.N. Charter recognizes the right of
nations to defend themselves, e.g., against suicide bombers, the
Europeans and their Arab allies obviously don't believe Israel has
that right. What makes anyone think they would recognize the right of
the U.S. to carpet-bomb the mountains of Afghanistan in response to
9/11?</TE>

<TE>   With all the talk of removing Saddam Hussein from power, there may
be an easier way to handle the matter if he mistreats his countrymen
or others in the future--and that is the International Criminal
Court. On April 11 the 60th country ratified it, bringing the court
into existence.</TE>
<TE>   This court, unlike the World Court at The Hague, will be able to
try individuals, not just countries. It will be a way to avoid the
civilian casualties that go with wars, while targeting the person
responsible for crimes against humanity. Though not retroactive, it
would be a deterrent for future plans by dictators to mistreat their
own people or others.</TE>

<LD>While the United States defends freedom and democracy against armed
terrorist forces, our government and citizens are being held hostage
by economic terrorists--the foreign oil cartel ("The Pressure Is On
to Play the Oil Card," by Jeremy Rifkin, Commentary, April 10). Every
day, we live under the threat that some foreign policy of the United
States will irk the Mideast oil lords, who will then cut off supply
to our country, devastating our economy. Always enjoying its role as
a Mideast destabilizing force, Iraq cut its oil supply to the U.S. in
response to the crisis in Israel.</LD>
<LD>   America's dependence on foreign oil must end. We cannot continue
to have our nation, its policies and our citizenry held hostage.
President Bush should marshal his enormous approval ratings and
America's resolve and challenge Americans to discover a workable
alternative fuel within 10 years. Only then will America truly defeat
terrorism.</LD>

<TE>   Stanford, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin points out that the U.S. currently obtains 9% of its oil
from Iraq. Bush has identified Iraq as a major sponsor of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   I eagerly await the public service ads showing someone filling up
an SUV at the gas pump while casually remarking, "Today, I helped
Saddam Hussein build weapons of mass destruction for terrorists. Hey,
I needed to get to work!"</TE>

<LD>The L.A. Fire Commission produced a 12-page color brochure covering
the brush clearance rules and sent it out to everyone. It announces a
deadline of April 15 instead of the historical May 1 as the day
everyone has to be in compliance. It arrived in homes on April 10.
This means many homeowners will not be in compliance, and
reinspections will be necessary.</LD>
<LD>   The brush clearance unit charges the homeowner a $218 reinspection
fee. Of course, that would never cover the cost of the brochure or
the cost of doing inspections two or three times instead of once. We
should have received a postcard in March if the date was changing,
and a simplified list of the basically simple rules for brush
clearance. Former Councilman Joel Wachs used to get after this kind
of waste in city government. I hope someone else there will pick up
the ball.</LD>

<LD>" 'I Was in This Alone' " (April 9), your front-page article about
sexual abuse, not only exposed the failures of the Catholic hierarchy
but also the failures of our secular medical community. Lori Haigh
told her psychiatrist about the sexual abuse. The psychiatrist is an
unbiased, paid professional, in whom Haigh placed her trust. Yet the
psychiatrist neither reported it to the proper authorities nor to her
parents.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps this warrants further investigating. What is the policy of
the American Psychiatric Assn.? What is it doing to ensure this never
happens again?</LD>

<TE>   I was molested by a priest 40 years ago. Fortunately it left no
long-term lasting effects. I just thought this was a very sick man
with some serious issues. I never did tell my parents. It would have
broken their hearts. My parents thought very highly of this man.
Sound familiar?</TE>
<TE>   Jesus said, "Beware of the Pharisees, that is, their hypocrisy.
Nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered, and nothing secret
that will not become known. Therefore whatever you have said in the
dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered behind
closed doors will be proclaimed from the housetops" (Luke 12:1-3).</TE>

<TE>   These alleged victims and their families simply could have
contacted the police. Had they done that, the credible cases could
have been investigated and prosecuted in a timely manner and the
abuse would have ended. Now they react with false indignation to the
fact that the alleged perpetrators were not brought to justice for
the unreported crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh has made the astonishing claim that she was molested by
three different priests within a period of three years. She was able
to report this to church leaders, a psychiatrist, a Planned
Parenthood abortion counselor, her friends and a roommate who was a
screenwriter. Why not the police?</TE>
<TE>   Statutes of limitations are in place for a reason. Priests, like
everyone else, are entitled to due process.</TE>

<TE>   If the record $30.6-million jury award for six women in their
sexual harassment case against Ralphs Grocery Co. (Business, April 9)
sent shock waves through the business community, the paltry
$1.2-million settlement awarded Haigh for her teenage sexual abuse
accusations against defrocked Catholic priest John Lenihan should
send a lethal spike through the heavens.</TE>
<TE>   The latter case was built stone by stone: seduction, abortion,
conniving, a Catholic hierarchy of male-dominated control and power
and, ultimately, Haigh's youth and adulthood a barren wasteland. And
for her years of aloneness and final courage to come forth, she was
awarded $1.2 million? How can one understand this gross inequity?</TE>

<TE>   Cardinal Roger Mahony needs to research what the Enlightenment
period did to and for the church. Get a clue--the "villagers" can now
speak and think without permission from the clergy. Could it be that
the technology of the day may force honesty from the professed?</TE>

<TE>   As a Catholic, I'm dismayed and angered by the pedophile priests
who have done enormous damage to their victims and to the Catholic
Church. They have betrayed their vows, the result of which has put
all priests under a cloud of suspicion. I strongly believe that the
vast majority of members of the clergy are honorable, selfless and
holy in their lives and in their ministries. Sadly, they have been
undermined by the actions of these rascals.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Catholic-bashing has been afforded additional momentum, and
false accusations against innocent clergy will result. Cardinal
Mahoney's situation is a case in point (''Police Clear Mahony of
Alleged 1970 Molestation,'' April 12).</TE>

<LD>"Will More Freeways Bring More Traffic" (April 10)? Well, of course
not. It's people who bring more traffic--7 million more in the next
20 years in Southern California alone. You can double-stack the
freeways, bulldoze houses on both sides and add more lanes until the
cows come clanging home, but if we don't start stemming population
growth we'll never fix the problem for good.</LD>
<LD>   And even if the goal of shoving more people through a given
freeway funnel in a given period of time is achieved, we've done
nothing to deal with depleted fisheries, clear-cut forests, species
extinction, global warming and on and on.</LD>
<LD>   The Times prints article after article describing massive problems
directly or indirectly caused by our burgeoning population, yet
always these articles focus myopically only on ways to accommodate
the growth. Never does The Times address the need for successful
national and global family planning. Never do reporters ask
politicians and planners to address the root cause.</LD>

<TE>   David Hartgen, professor of transportation studies at the
University of North Carolina, rejects out of hand the theory of
induced traffic for why new freeway lanes fill up within a few years
of being built. His alternative explanation is that the lanes are
instead filling with drivers who previously used surface streets or
alternate highway routes.</TE>
<TE>   Even if he is correct I would quibble with his final point that
thus, on a regional level, new lanes provide congestion relief. The
late writer Theodore Sturgeon stated that one should always ask the
next question. And in this case, that question should be, what
happens to those surface streets and alternate highway routes when
they become less congested? Answer: They quickly re-congest due to
induced traffic. This shell game doesn't result in meaningful
congestion relief, only higher traffic volumes under sardine-like
conditions. For this we should spend billions?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"L.A.'s Wide-Open Space" (editorial, April 10) leaves readers with
the perception that the Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau has
no oversight. On the contrary, the bureau is held accountable to its
board of directors, a broad base of volunteer leaders from businesses
throughout Los Angeles, to the L.A. City Council and to the mayor.</LD>
<LD>   Our work is governed by a three-year strategic marketing plan
created in partnership with hotels, airlines, labor, attractions and
the Los Angeles Convention Center. Each year, we submit to the city
our goals and performance on reaching them.</LD>
<LD>   On a quarterly basis our production in international marketing,
cultural tourism, domestic marketing and sports and entertainment, as
well as convention sales, is examined. Over the course of the past 10
years, that accountability has led to enormous growth in both the
visitor economy and the work of the LACVB.</LD>
<TE>   While booking conventions is only part of our job, a portion of
that market segment is seeing strong sales production. The bureau is
responsible for meetings that can be contained in individual hotels.</TE>
<TE>   In the past eight months, we have closed on more than 350 meetings
yielding $57 million in direct revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Convention center bookings have fallen in the past 18 months for a
number of reasons. Correctly, you pointed out the No. 1 reason: a
dearth of hotel rooms within walking distance of the Los Angeles
Convention Center. We enjoyed success in recent years while two of
our competitors--San Diego and Anaheim--were recasting the hotel and
visitor infrastructure that now supports their centers. We must do
the same.</TE>

<HD>A Westside Story of Death, Denial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL CIEPLY</AU>
<BD>Michael Cieply is a Los Angeles writer and the parent
of a Santa Monica High School freshman.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been chilling, like a riff from Stephen King, to watch the
comfortable Westside quietly bury a horror in its midst.</LD>
<LD>   Not quite five months ago, a 15-year-old Santa Monica High School
sophomore named Deanna Maran was stabbed in the heart--"shanked," as
one participant put it--during a party at an upscale Westwood home.
About a hundred kids had been in and out of the house that evening. A
quarter of them were from Santa Monica High, the rest from some of
the best private schools in Los Angeles. Kids at the party say
alcohol flowed freely. And law enforcement officials say there wasn't
a responsible adult in sight at the home of the Milken Community High
School student who hosted the bash.</LD>
<LD>   Maran reprimanded another 15-year-old for breaking some potted
houseplants. The other girl left, returning with her 17-year-old
half-sister, Katrina Sarkissian, who murdered a pleading Maran as a
group of kids watched, screaming "Bitch fight!" and cheering them on.
Nobody stopped the assault, nor, apparently, called 911 until after
Maran briefly got up, staggered, and then died. The next morning, in
a weird coda, Sarkissian herself collapsed in a West Los Angeles
police station and died shortly after, having overdosed on an
antidepressant.</LD>
<TE>   And the process of forgetting soon began. After talking with 37
witnesses, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office moved against
Sarkissian's sister two weeks ago, filing just one count of battery
and another of making an unrelated "terrorist threat" against someone
other than Maran on a separate occasion. So light were the charges,
they didn't even get a line in The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Noblin, a deputy D.A. who's handling the case, says no
further action is likely, unless significant new information comes to
light. According to Noblin, an extensive investigation turned up no
firm evidence that anyone had pinned Maran to the ground, despite
reports to the contrary. Still, Maran's parents, apparently
clear-thinking people who raised five children according to a strict
code of personal responsibility, have been told by party-goers that
at least one girl held Deanna in a chokehold while she was attacked
and many others watched. "My daughter died as entertainment. It [was]
a spectator sport," says Harriet Maran, Deanna's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Police interviews, Noblin says, found nothing to support claims
that several college-age boys formed a line to keep younger kids from
breaking up the cat-fight. She dismisses as "rumors" persistent talk
about a group of college students who supposedly scattered to the
winds when Maran died.</TE>
<TE>   As to questions about who supplied alcohol to the hundred or so
privileged youngsters, Noblin says "that hasn't been the focus,"
though she supposes police could double back on the issue if they
chose. For her even to identify the party's host-family, she says,
would require a court order. The law's concern, first and foremost,
is to protect and rehabilitate youth, even when they've crossed a
hideous line.</TE>
<TE>   "We're only supposed to prosecute people who are guilty. We're not
supposed to prosecute people because something horrible has happened
and people are frustrated," says Noblin, who points out that the
greatest crime in all of this is the general lapse of parental
responsibility. The Marans, who had taught their children to resist
rather than avoid inevitable temptations, are considering litigation
in connection with the incident, but aren't convinced it will really
fix anything.</TE>
<TE>   On the prep-school circuit, administrators appear less than eager
to discuss how some of their meticulously tended young charges went
so badly wrong. Sarkissian's death certificate lists her as a student
at Harvard-Westlake, among the most rigorous and prestigious of these
schools. To know what pushed this presumably bright young woman, said
to be tattooed with the word "Princess" on her back, toward homicidal
mania would seem to be of more than casual interest. Was it the
drugs, or her parents' long-ago divorce, or maybe the pressures to
conform or to perform on a very fast track that starts with the right
preschool and runs through the nightmare of college admission? Had
she really been thrown out of Harvard-Westlake and bounced around to
other private schools as some kids say? Did she once slit the nose of
a girl at the progressive Crossroads school, only to have the
incident hushed up? It's difficult to know what's become of the
social culture in these very private institutions. Harvard-Westlake's
headmaster didn't return telephone calls, nor was anyone available to
offer comment at Milken, a Jewish temple-affiliated school whose Web
site carries a quote: "The world stands on three things: on Torah,
Service of God, and Deeds of Loving Kindness." One can only hope
these good educators are teaching lessons about the savagery of last
November, rather than choosing to look away.</TE>
<TE>   Students at Santa Monica High, for their part, have started a
Deanna Maran scholarship fund to promote nonviolence. Within days of
the murder, however, a teacher who spoke at Maran's memorial service
in the school's outdoor Greek Theater was already telling those who
had stood by while she was butchered that they must not risk
themselves by carrying a burden of guilt. This seemed a frightening
bit of advice--as if true guilt, a sense of responsibility for
something bad, had been demoted to the status of a negative feeling
that should have no place in these otherwise sunny lives. By March,
the school was ready to join in the general forgetting. At its annual
"Stairway of the Stars" musical extravaganza, nobody even mentioned
Deanna Maran, the pretty Czech-Filipino honor student who should have
been standing in the back row of the chorus, adding her voice to a
spirited performance of "The Rhythm of Life" from "Sweet Charity."</TE>
<TE>   "Kids want to pretend it never happened," shrugs Harriet. "They're
retreating from something ugly, and why wouldn't they? Their best
friend was killed in front of their eyes."</TE>
<TE>   So we're trying, the lot of us, to make this go away. But it isn't
right. Not before we understand a great deal more about what happened
in Westwood last fall, and why.</TE>

<HD>It Takes a Chief</HD>
<DH>The LAPD needs a boss who's tough, who knows how to lead
and who believes in reform. Is that too much to ask?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE DOMANICK</AU>
<BD>Joe Domanick, the author of "To Protect and to Serve:
The LAPD's Century of War in the City of Dreams," is a senior fellow
at the USC Annenberg School of Communication's Institute for Justice
in Journalism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Am I alone here? Or are other people getting tired, too, of the
center-stage soap opera that's been playing at the Los Angeles Police
Department for more than a decade? I keep waiting for the city to cut
through a morass of false assumptions about its chiefs of police and
see them in a clear light.</LD>
<LD>   Consider last Tuesday's dueling press conferences. The first
featured Rick J. Caruso, president of the Los Angeles Police
Commission, explaining why his group had followed the lead of Mayor
James Hahn--who, of course, hand-picked the commission--and voted 4
to 1 not to rehire LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks. By Caruso's account,
Parks' greatest sin seemed to be his responsibility for the
ever-plunging morale of the LAPD's rank and file--rather than the
Rampart scandal, or the chief's complete unwillingness to transform
the LAPD's paramilitary culture.</LD>
<LD>   It was enough to make one wonder if the city's African American
leadership hadn't been right in charging that Mayor Hahn, and now his
Police Commission, were jettisoning Parks as political payback to the
white-dominated Police Protective League, which gave critical support
to Hahn during his run for mayor.</LD>
<TE>   At his own press conference, meanwhile, Parks was avoiding the
real issues as skillfully as Caruso. The chief admitted to no
failings or missteps and defiantly vowed to take his battle to the
City Council. The Council, if it so chooses, could overturn the
Commission's decision by a two-thirds vote--a highly unlikely
scenario.</TE>
<TE>   Parks is rightly viewed by many African Americans in Los Angeles
as an important symbol--a smart, successful black man holding down
one of the most visible and powerful public positions in the city.
But in the end, being a symbol was not enough. Parks was simply
unwilling to institute the crucial reforms that would have provided
the city with the police department it desperately needs and
deserves. Consequently, he's become the latest in a long line of LAPD
chiefs whose tenures have ultimately been failures.</TE>
<TE>   Although in perfect philosophical sync with Mayor Richard Riordan,
who appointed him Chief in 1997, Bernard Parks never gave the people
of Los Angeles what they voted for in 1992 and 1995 when they
overwhelmingly passed a sweeping package of police reforms
recommended by the Christopher Commission and designed to serve as
the mechanism for rebuilding and reforming the LAPD. Training and
discipline were to be placed under far greater civilian control,
while monitored by a civilian Inspector General's Office. And a
Christopher Commision-endorsed computer system for tracking problem
officers was to be installed. Underpinning all this was to be a new
operating philosophy of community-based policing, in which officers
would work with the community rather than ride herd over it.</TE>
<TE>   Little of this, however, was on former Mayor Richard Riordan's
agenda. He wanted a big, tough, smoothly oiled crime fighting
machine--a less-controversial, better-run version of the old LAPD.
When Riordan's Police Commission named Parks as the new chief in
1997, the mayor laid out the criteria by which he'd judge Parks'
success: crime stats and arrest numbers. That was what Riordan
considered reform.</TE>
<TE>   Parks embraced Riordan's message. But he danced as well to his own
tune. For nearly half a century the central tenet of all LAPD chiefs
(save Willie Williams, the despised outsider) has been that the chief
and only the chief ran the LAPD. And Parks, by instinct, training and
character, is very much in that tradition.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, Chief William H. Parker was the first to recognize the
astounding power granted a chief in the city charter, and he used it
shrewdly to make the LAPD his own. Ed Davis, police chief throughout
most of the 1970s, once summed up his and Parker's attitude toward
outsiders "interfering" with their department. "Parker," said Davis,
"found himself fighting off the evil forces from City Hall ... and
various groups in the city. And it is absolutely vital that this
department not be dominated by politicians." Davis also understood
the power of the office. Asked if he intended to run for mayor, he
replied, "I don't want to be mayor; I already have more power than
the mayor." And he was right. From 1950 to 1992, LAPD chiefs had
ironclad civil-service protection and the same lifetime tenure
enjoyed by federal judges. Mayors came and went, but a chief of
police remained as long as he wished. That situation changed only
when Charter Amendment F, passed in 1992, limited future chiefs to
one five-year term, with the option of applying for a second and
final five years in office.</TE>
<TE>   One huge impetus for that change was the spectacle of Mayor Tom
Bradley impotently imploring Chief Daryl Gates to resign following
the 1991 beating of Rodney King. Gates simply refused. By the time
Parks became chief, however, the power dynamic had shifted. A chief
like Parks could no longer push the mayor around. But he still
retained enough power to serve as the mayor's equal, especially given
that Parks, Riordan and their sycophants on the Police Commission
were all on the same wavelength--and they weren't focused on reform.</TE>
<TE>   So Parks contemptuously dismissed community policing, forced the
department's first inspector general out of office and refused to
share vital investigative information with the second, failed to
implement a computerized officer-tracking system, denigrated the
importance of the Rampart scandal and severely limited the
department's investigation into it, tried to cut the district
attorney out of the Rampart-prosecution loop and launched an enormous
number of investigations of officers over the most trivial of
matters.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, Davis and Gates had turned rigidity, intransigence and the
arrogance of power into an art form. But times had changed, and Parks
seemed not to have noticed. The Rodney King beating, the '92 uprising
and the Rampart scandal all helped destroy the once sacrosanct LAPD
mystique, sapping the juice out of the department's public support;
while charter reform diminished its once unchecked power.</TE>
<TE>   Parks had been a noncontroversial, even popular choice for chief.
Other than some totally ineffective grumbling from the Protective
League, he had no real opposition. Yet Parks is now leaving office
with few non-African American defenders. Lawyer and political
kingmaker William Wardlaw--who had literally helped Parks study for
the chief's test--turned against him. Parks' friends in government,
like County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, have failed to spring to his
defense. The same has been true of the city's corporate leaders,
civil libertarians and police reformers. Parks began his tenure as a
virtual co-mayor, and ended up out of a job.</TE>
<TE>   Now we're about to search for a new chief. And all the wrong
questions are being asked: Will he be black? Will it cause problems
if he's brown? Should he be an insider? Can an outsider do the job?
What about a woman? There are times when such criteria must be taken
into consideration, as in 1992 after Gates' departure. The African
American community had suffered decades of racism, brutality,
killings and humiliation at the hands of the LAPD. Simple justice
demanded a black chief. Now Los Angeles has had two, and we've
learned that, while symbols are important, race has largely been
beside the point in fundamentally reforming the LAPD. And fundamental
reform is all this selection process should be about.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission should choose a chief who has stature,
reform experience and an iron will in standing up to the command
staff and Protective League, coupled with the leadership skills to
bring officers and their union along during the reform process. Most
especially we need a chief who recognizes that the mayor, through his
police commissioners, is the boss. The new chief should be at the top
of his or her game and look upon reforming the LAPD as a career
capstone. He or she must be an outsider--someone who can see far
beyond the department's culture and who, unlike former Chief
Williams, has the savvy to come into L.A. and form political
alliances with like-minded political players. Whether Mayor Hahn has
the desire, self-confidence or strength to urge the hiring of such a
chief, remains, of course, an open question.</TE>
<TE>   If he does, Hahn should not stop there. He should go on to push
for a charter amendment allowing the mayor to directly choose his
chief of police. The city must learn to regard its police chief as a
skilled and very important department head--but one who is
ultimately, and directly, responsible to the city's chief executive.
The argument that this will inject politics into the department is
absurd. What have chiefs in Los Angeles been if not unelected,
unaccountable politicians representing their own interests? A chief
needs to be selected directly by the mayor and serve at the mayor's
pleasure. Tom Bradley should have had the right to fire Daryl Gates
before he led us down the path to racial insurrection. Richard
Riordan should have been able to fire Willie Williams if he felt he
couldn't work with him. And James Hahn should have a chief of police
who shares his vision. Then we can hold the mayor--and only the
mayor--accountable come election day.</TE>

Informed Food Choice in Oakland.</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The addition of a vegetarian option to Burger King's sandwich menu
last month was greeted with a rousing cheer by a one-time nemesis of
the fast-food giant. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
which only last year engaged in a heated (and ultimately successful)
effort to get the company to hold its meat suppliers accountable to
basic animal welfare standards, had high praise for the "BK Veggie."
"The new veggie burger is sure to both raise Burger King's revenues
and lower Americans' cholesterol levels," said Bruce Friedrich,
PETA's national campaign coordinator. "[It's] a winning proposition
for animals, people and the planet. We hope everyone will give the
veggie burger a royal welcome."</LD>
<LD>   Before rolling out the red carpet, it's worth taking a closer look
at Burger King's new product.</LD>
<TE>   Nutritionally, the BK Veggie has little to recommend it. The patty
alone is composed of an astonishing 48 ingredients, including such
marvels of modern food science as sodium acid pyrophosphate,
hydrolyzed corn gluten and "grill flavor." Combined with its
nutritionally deficient, refined-flour bun, the sandwich reflects the
ingenuity of its engineers more than it does Burger King's concern
for the health of its customers. Granted, the BK Veggie is less a
health nightmare the company's familiar fatty, cholesterol-laden
burgers. It has about half the sodium of a Whopper and even has a
smattering of grains and frozen vegetables. And when served without
its mayonnaise topping, it contains no animal products, except for a
trace amount of dairy.</TE>
<TE>   But the mere absence of meat and cheese from the BK Veggie says
nothing about its nutritional value. Froot Loops, Pepsi and Burger
King's own French fries, for that matter, are also free of animal
products, but few health advocates would seriously recommend
consuming these foods as part of a well-balanced meal plan. Promoters
of the BK Veggie are doing the public a serious disservice by
suggesting that it is anything other than a highly processed,
nutritionally deficient junk food that just happens to be meatless.</TE>
<TE>   From an environmental standpoint, Burger King's new menu item is
also not much to celebrate. A BK Veggie is produced with ingredients
originating in disparate locations: The onions might come from Iowa,
the smoke flavoring from New Jersey and the jalapeno powder from
Mexico. They are brought to a central manufacturing plant, assembled,
packaged and reshipped in their new "value-added" incarnation to
Burger King franchises far and wide. This method of producing and
distributing food draws heavily on fossil fuels and other
nonrenewable resources, a price that our beleaguered ecosphere can
ill afford to pay.</TE>
<TE>   True, the ecological footprint of a BK Veggie is appreciably
lighter than that left by one of the chain's highly
resource-consumptive meat sandwiches. But trumpeting the marginal
environmental benefits of a mass-produced industrial
pseudo-food--meatless though it may be--does little more than supply
the Burger King PR machine with a ready source of greenwash.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is the question of animal welfare. Does the
addition of the BK Veggie to the Burger King menu stand to improve
the plight of the 9 billion animals slaughtered each year for human
consumption? In a recent article, vegetarian activist Erik Marcus
warned that if the BK Veggie flops, "it might set the growth of the
movement [to protect animals] back 10 years." That's an awful lot to
hang on the fate of one sandwich. The truth is, Burger King's new
entree will do little to keep animals out of the slaughterhouse. What
it will do is lend a patina of green respectability to a corporation
whose appetite for dead animals is as robust as its desire for
greater profits and increased market share. Consumers who believe
that purchasing a BK Veggie will encourage the company to scale back
its efforts to sell as many meat sandwiches as possible will be sadly
disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Let's not forget that Burger King has been a leading force behind
such "enlightened" policies as suburban sprawl, the homogenization
and commodification of the global food supply and the backlash
against unions and food- and restaurant-industry workers
worldwide--points well documented by Eric Schlosser in his
best-selling book, "Fast Food Nation." Burger King, McDonald's and
the other corporate giants that command the industrial food economy
have no vested interest in fundamentally restructuring it.</TE>
<TE>   Some may object that we can't change the system overnight and that
people are used to eating fast food, so isn't the availability of a
meatless burger in a major chain a step in the right direction? Well,
yes, it is a step, but a step toward what, exactly? A nation in which
animal-based foods are replaced by plant foods transformed into
products bearing little resemblance to actual plants? Our modern food
economy was built on the promise of "better eating through
technology." We should be working to create a more just, humane and
sustainable food system that provides people with produce in its
whole, unadulterated form--as nature meant for it to be eaten.
Pinning our hopes for a better food system on the fortunes of the
Burger King empire's latest junk food amounts to a rather depressing
surrender of the imagination.</TE>

<AU>PATRICK GILES</AU>
<BD>Patrick Giles is associate editor of Interview
Magazine.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>I am both a Catholic and a victim of sexual abuse. So each day's news
of lawsuits, cover-ups and sexual accusations against priests is like
a slap. How could this have happened in my church? And once it did,
how could so many of our leaders respond to reports of abuse by
trying to bury them?</LD>
<LD>   The truth is, the hierarchy ruling the Catholic Church frequently
conceals its inner workings, even (perhaps especially) from its
members. So it's no real surprise that one of its first reactions
when hit with this latest wave of scandal was to fall back on a
tried-and-true technique. Influential church fundamentalists like
William Donohue of The Catholic League are correct when they point to
homosexuality as the unspoken issue of this miserable affair but
wrong in their conclusion that homosexuality itself is the problem.
Aside from their disgraceful persistence in equating gayness with
pedophilia (a number of the molestation cases involve priests
attacking girls), these Catholics avoid the truth our religion has
denied for centuries: Without gays, there is no priesthood.</LD>
<TE>   From the beginning, the church has attracted its priests as much
through bigotry as through faith. For over a millennium, gay
Catholics had almost no choice but to become priests. Out in the
world, their sexuality placed them at an unbearable risk of
imprisonment, torture and death--not to mention pariah status within
their own families. But within the walls of a rectory or monastery,
they could live in penance for being who they were, while at the same
time contributing to the propagation of the faith that misunderstood
and abused them. Gays have kept this pact with the church ever since,
and their sacrifice and dedication have kept the institution up and
running. But this responsibility has carried with it a heavy burden
of denial and silence that has contributed to today's unprecedented
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Mine was the first generation of gay Catholics given a new choice
for living our lives. Prior to our time, the religious gay son in a
Catholic family had limited options upon reaching adulthood. He could
hide his true identity by marrying a woman, as many did (and still
do); he could stay home and care for his parents for the rest of
their lives; or he could answer a religious calling, and either deny
the gay part of himself or exercise it within the disguising embrace
of the church. (When I became an adult and moved out to attend
college, my godmother was surprised. "I always thought you were the
one who'd be going into the priesthood," she blurted out one day. It
took me some time to realize her assumption was not based on any show
of religious fervor on my part.)</TE>
<TE>   I didn't go into the priesthood because the world has changed even
if the church hasn't. We don't all need to hide behind cassocks
anymore. Gay Catholic laity are eager to be fully accepted, to marry
and raise families in the church. Today's gay priests are
increasingly open about themselves and are frequently tolerated, even
supported, by their parishioners (if not their superiors). Father
Mychal Judge, for example, the New York City Fire Department chaplain
who perished along with so many of his men on Sept. 11, walked a fine
line of being "neither out nor closeted," as one of his friends told
the national gay magazine The Advocate. But his sexuality was never
acknowledged publicly by the church. Is it any wonder, given its
history of seeing gay priests as a great scandal, that the church's
response to this true disgrace was to cover up the incidents and
leave the pain of their victims unaddressed?</TE>
<TE>   A new generation of religious historians is uncovering evidence
that Catholicism in its early years was not so hysterically obsessed
with eradicating homosexuality and did not always brand gays with the
mark of the devil. The studies of John Boswell (author of
"Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexuality") and others
suggest gay people not only existed in the early church, some of them
flourished, especially in the religious orders. But in recent years,
gay Catholics eager for dialogue about their rightful place have been
answered with a wall of hostility as solid and immovable as the wall
of sexual silence used to be. Many gays who served this church as
priests and nuns have been harassed or ejected or left in
disillusion. Faced with dwindling numbers due to their own
intolerance, bishops and cardinals began holding on to the few
priests they had left--even, it turns out, if they were child
abusers.</TE>
<TE>   The perfectly pitched, carefully calibrated letter of
"explanation" New York's Cardinal Edward M. Egan handed out at
parishes a few weeks ago would have done an Enron spin doctor proud,
but it also demonstrated that he and other implicated leaders cannot
be trusted to resolve this crisis. (It was Egan, after all, who as a
Connecticut bishop once stated in a deposition that the diocese
should not be held liable for its molesting clergy because priests
were "independent contractors.")</TE>
<TE>   It still hasn't sunk in with some leaders that quality spin won't
resolve anything. "If I had known about this, I would never have sent
my kids to Catholic schools," a mother of several grown Catholics
told me in the vestibule of St. Patrick's during Holy Week. She then
raised her voice to reiterate: "Never." Such Catholics--and no one
should mistake them for a minority--don't want feel-good messages.
They want truthful explanations, sincere penance and reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Our best hope for emerging from this scandal as a stronger
community lies in supporting those rank-and-file priests and nuns who
have served us so nobly. I have been hearing plenty of indignation
and frustration from members of the clergy. (One fine and dedicated
priest I know told me about a colleague who noticed a young mother on
the street the other day pulling her son tightly to her side when she
noticed the priest walking in their direction.) With our backing,
clergy must demand improvements from an increasingly authoritarian
and self-interested Catholic Church that helped create the current
"don't ask, don't tell" climate.</TE>
<TE>   Our current Catholic leaders would seemingly rather face screaming
headlines and class-action lawsuits than listen and learn from their
own clerics and worshipers. But they have no real choice anymore,
unless they cling to the belief that the horror, anger and sense of
betrayal felt by their faithful will all just die down. They must
listen, and they must change. And it's ridiculous to insist, as some
Catholic conservatives have, that the church's teachings and actions
are cast in stone. Answering the needs of changing times, the church
no longer celebrates mass in Latin. It no longer tortures and burns
heretics. The church is not, after all, just its leaders: It is also
its worshipers, and, if they apply enough pressure, change is
inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   For the sake of our children, we must demand to stop being treated
like children. And we must not accept the easy reassurances that the
very people behind these tragedies of hypocrisy can be trusted to
lead us in a better direction. After all, we've seen what happens to
good little Catholics trained to confuse sanctity with silence.</TE>

<AU>ORI NIR</AU>
<BD>Ori Nir covers Israel's Arab minority for the daily
newspaper Ha'aretz.</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>Aviva Nahmani didn't want to be interviewed for national television.
At least not right at that moment. Just an hour earlier, at her son
Naveh's bar mitzvah, a suicide bomber had blown himself up, injuring
several of her family members, some of them severely. The 36-year-old
woman was now pacing in the emergency room of Bikur Holim hospital in
downtown Jerusalem, punching her cellular phone, trying to gather
information on the medical condition of her loved ones, scattered in
hospitals around town.</LD>
<LD>   But a young, eager television reporter kept cajoling her, coaxing
the stunned woman to speak to her. Unable to muster enough resistance
to fend off the reporter, Nahmani agreed. The interview made for
great television.</LD>
<LD>   This kind of victim badgering didn't used to be part of an Israeli
journalist's job. But since the fall of 2000, when Palestinians
launched an intense campaign of bombing and shooting attacks inside
the Jewish state, the Israeli media have gradually dropped many of
their self-imposed inhibitions. Today we are all expected to be, if
not as crass as that television reporter, at least sufficiently
immune to tragedy to bring back the goods.</LD>
<TE>   Reporters at Ha'aretz newspaper where I work recently received a
memo from the head of the news department titled: ''Obituaries of
Terrorism Victims.'' The memo advised us to be fresh and interesting,
to stay reserved, avoid cliches and not to get carried away with
relatives' grief.</TE>
<TE>   Reading the memo, I realized something: In this past year, we have
all become obituary writers. We cover death. Over and over again.</TE>
<TE>   As deadly terrorism becomes routine, so does its coverage. We rush
to cover a suicide bombing in the morning, positioning ourselves as
close as possible to the carcass of a bus where bodies are still
trapped. We rub shoulders with the squads of ultra-Orthodox Jews who
volunteer to collect body parts (often with tweezers and tiny
zip-lock bags). Having visited the site, we run to hospitals to look
for eye-witnesses, relatives or lightly injured survivors who are not
in shock. Then on to the homes of the people who were killed, to
gently ask for photos and gather ''fresh and interesting'' material
for an obituary. The next morning we cover the funerals. There have
been more than 70 suicide bombings and shooting attacks against
Israeli civilians in the past year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   Covering terrorism has become an enormous challenge for Israeli
reporters and editors. Everything has been said. Almost everything
has been shown. With each attack, television crews zoom in a little
closer on victims. Close-ups of bleeding people, once considered
taboo, are now commonplace. Tight shots of ambulance interiors, as
rescue crews try to revive victims, have become routine. The names of
those killed are broadcast within hours, much faster than ever
before. An endless stream of hollow words fills the airwaves as TV
reporters and anchors must pad live reports that start with news
flashes and continue for hours. Radio stations, desperate for
something fresh, no longer bother to screen those who call in with
eyewitness reports.</TE>
<TE>   The coverage of terrorism here has become rough and crude and
relentless. Like everyone else who responds to terrorist
attacks--security forces, medics, body-part collectors, insurance
agents--reporters have become skilled, inured and frighteningly fast.
News of an attack airs on the radio minutes after an explosion.
Camera crews race to hospitals to be there before ambulances arrive
and get live footage of victims being wheeled into emergency rooms.
TV producers receive footage from camera crews at a bombing site or a
hospital and air it without prior screening. Often, the cameramen are
amateurs who happened to be in the area, with their camcorders, and
rushed their rough footage to national television. This rush to air
any relevant material recently resulted in a television station
showing the body of a partially naked woman on a stretcher. Another
bombing victim, shown on television sobbing hysterically as rescue
crews rushed her to an ambulance, said in an interview recently that
she felt violated twice: once by the terrorist and again by the
press.</TE>
<TE>   The routine causes a strong sense of deja vu a well-known enemy of
fresh and creative reporting. Recently, following a shooting attack
in downtown Jerusalem, a television reporter interviewing a merchant
realized that he had interviewed the man after another attack,
several weeks earlier. The interviewer and interviewee giggled for a
moment at the bitter irony, then went on with the interview.
Reporters now look for repeat casualties. Being injured only once no
longer makes for a thrilling story.</TE>
<TE>   Blood has been shown. Now editors want to show bloodier photos. In
early March, as reporters were waiting to interview Mrs. Nahmani at
Bikur Holim hospital, one of the photojournalists received a message
from his editor on his pager. "I want as many pics of injured babies
as possible," it said.</TE>
<TE>   About two months ago, our news staff convened for its annual
assembly. It was the first such meeting since this wave of terrorism
started. The managing editor complimented reporters for a job well
done and mentioned that the paper was willing to provide
psychological counseling for those who needed it. The staff felt it
needed something else instead: another bulletproof car, better
bulletproof vests and helmets. The paper is in the process of
purchasing a radio communication system with powerful walkie-talkies,
we were told, since security authorities intentionally take down the
cell-phone system after terrorist attacks to prevent terrorists from
using cell phones to set off follow-up bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The managing editor also agreed to draft all the newspapers'
reporters, including those who write for the business, sports and
lifestyle sections to participate in covering terrorism. They have
now joined the ranks of obituary writers, after taking a special
workshop, given by a team of reporters with extensive experience in
the field.</TE>
<TE>   The routine nature of terrorism coverage sometimes seems to feed
off the public's terrorism fatigue, a weariness of being consumed by
anxiety and of obsessing on the abnormality of daily life. Israel's
commercial Channel 2 recently chose to show live video from a bombing
site on a split screen with the live airing of the Saturday-night
soccer game.</TE>
<TE>   Competition among news organizations is fierce. Each of them still
strives to provide the best coverage of the latest attack. But most
reporters manage to tame their rivalry in order to save families
unnecessary pain. They try to coordinate arrival at the home of a
bereaved family to minimize the hassle and pain involved in providing
information for the obituaries.</TE>
<TE>   As one reporter explained during our latest staff assembly, "There
are no scoops here. Anyway, we always end up with 'He loved life' and
'She was a wonderful person.' You know, they are all 'loved by
everyone.'"</TE>
<TE>   People laughed. Some of us exchanged disgusted looks, realizing
just how numb we have all become. Yet it is our job to keep our
readers from becoming anesthetized to death, pain and suffering. More
than 18 months into this eruption of violence, both Israelis and
Palestinians have hardened their hearts to the carnage and misery
that they inflict on each other, devising ways to cope with their own
agony. It is the role of the media to compassionately but
persistently remind both societies of the terrible price in human
life and suffering that all parties to the conflict are paying.</TE>
<TE>   And so we write obituaries.</TE>

<HD>From Inside Iraq, A Plea for U.S. Action</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL RUBIN</AU>
<BD>Michael Rubin is an adjunct scholar at the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As the debate intensifies over U.S. policy toward Iraq, I keep
thinking about a conversation I had last spring over dinner with a
surgeon I'd met while visiting a hospital in Northern Iraq. "We have
real problems with the United States," he said. "The American
government always interferes in the Middle East. But it doesn't
interfere enough in Iraq."</LD>
<LD>   As the rest of the world dithers about whether President George W.
Bush overstepped bounds in declaring Iraq to be part of an "Axis of
Evil," Kurds in the so-called "safe haven" of Northern Iraq have few
doubts. During nine months of teaching history there last year, I met
hundreds of Iraqi Kurds. I played pick-up soccer with pharmacists and
mechanics, hiked in the mountains with lawyers and soldiers and lost
at PlayStation auto racing to accountants and local journalists.
Almost to a person, those I met would welcome help in ridding their
country of Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   I crossed the border into Iraq illegally in September 2000. Under
Hussein, visiting scholars from the United States are unwelcome. But,
I had an invitation from the Kurdish parties governing the safe haven
to lecture in Iranian history in the region's three universities. The
opportunity to both teach and learn was irresistible. I stayed until
June.</LD>
<TE>   For six weeks, I shared a house with an Arab medical school
professor from Baghdad University. He was fed up with the corruption
in Baghdad and had told his colleagues he was going to Jordan.
Instead, he came to the safe haven, a region about the size of New
Jersey in which Iraqis can live free of persecution and outside
Hussein's control. Many Iraqis come to the safe-haven to shop and, if
they can, stay and work. Even though the safe-haven is under the same
sanctions as the rest of the country, the economy is much better than
in Hussein's Iraq. People are relatively free to speak their minds
there.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Baghdad, the professor said, he had been required to
participate in "spontaneous" demonstrations. On the morning of a
rally, buses would line up in front of the university, and the dean
would order him to get his students on board. Students who refused
were expelled or worse. Those who demonstrated got free meals, and
those who managed to get interviewed by the Western press were
rewarded with money, assuming they said things in support of the
regime.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqis in the safe haven readily describe the fear under which
they once lived. Several pointed out to me the former security prison
in Sulaimaniya where their friends and relatives had been executed by
Baath Party secret police. Such prisons still exist in other parts of
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Many of my students described living through the Anfal campaign, a
10-month orgy of violence in 1987 and 1988 when Saddam Hussein razed
4,000 of Northern Iraq's 4,655 villages and killed as many as 180,000
of his own citizens. Several students I came to know had lived
through Hussein's intense chemical weapons bombardment of the eastern
Iraqi town of Halabja that killed 5,000 civilians. My students told
of seeing their parents or siblings slowly choke to death. One veiled
sophomore told me that her respiratory infections have been almost
constant since she first inhaled "the almond smelling gas" at
Halabja. Another student, raised by an uncle after his family was
killed by the chemicals, told me he still meets his three brothers
and two sisters in his dreams. Farmers in Halabja complain that
people still hesitate to buy their peanuts, chickpeas and melons
because they think that eating Halabja produce will cause in their
children the kind of birth defects common there in the years
following the bombardment.</TE>
<TE>   The chemical attack on Halabja was not a unique event. One priest
in a Christian village outside Amadya told me about seeing an Iraqi
plane in 1988 circle low over the cultivated fields and drop chemical
weapons that sent a "white smoke" blowing over a number of houses.
The priest loaded up people who'd been exposed to the gas into his
pickup truck and drove them to a hospital four miles away. Only half
of them survived the trip.</TE>
<TE>   I made a point of stopping unannounced at hospitals around
Northern Iraq. In Halabja, doctors described sharp increases in
infertility, lung fibrosis and birth defects after the attacks.
Specialists also report skyrocketing rates of rare cancers,
especially those of the digestive and intestinal tracks. One doctor
told me that in the village of Khalilhama, which has a population of
only a couple hundred, he knew of six cases of colon cancer diagnosed
in one year. All the victims were in their twenties.</TE>
<TE>   While the safe haven is freer than most of Iraq, it does not have
the resources to treat or even properly study its victims of chemical
warfare. Under terms of a 1996 United Nations agreement, Hussein
controls the activities of U.N. agencies operating within Iraq's
borders. Baghdad determines, for example, how humanitarian aid is
spent, and it is a sad fact that Baghdad often refuses to order
medicines that could save lives. When it does, it often directs
contracts to its political allies like Malaysia rather than ordering
high-quality pharmaceuticals from countries like Sweden. The U.N.
also relies on Baghdad to issue visas to U.N. workers. Currently Iraq
is preventing 280 U.N. officials from entering its borders.</TE>
<TE>   Preventive medical treatment is further complicated by the fact
that Baghdad has yet to allow relevant U.N. agencies or
nongovernmental organizations to engage in systematic testing to
determine exactly what substances civilians were exposed to (forensic
evidence indicates that the Iraqi government used not only mustard
and nerve agents, but also a wide variety of biological and
radiological weapons).</TE>
<TE>   If medicines are in short supply, food is not--despite suggestions
that the embargo has led to massive shortages. Under terms of the
"oil for food" program, every Iraqi man, woman, and child receives
2,472 calories per day. The U.N.'s World Health Organization and the
Food and Agriculture Organization found in a September 2000 report
that the leading cause of adult mortality in Iraq is hypertension and
diabetes, neither a disease associated with hunger. The mission found
half of all Iraqis to be overweight. Many activists cite a 1999
UNICEF report claiming that 500,000 children died because of
sanctions, but fail to mention the report's co-author was the Iraqi
Ministry of Health, which provided many of the statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Some State Department diplomats and CIA officials, as well as many
Arab governments, continue to counsel against overthrowing Saddam,
voicing concerns over what comes next--the so-called fear of the
alternative. For Iraqis--those in the safe haven at least--the bigger
fear is of the here and now.</TE>

<HD>Musharraf Risks All With Needless Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAHEEN SEHBAI</AU>
<BD>Shaheen Sehbai recently resigned under government
pressure as editor of The News, a leading English-language Pakistani
newspaper.</BD>
<DL>GREAT FALLS, Va.</DL>
<LD>Pakistan's fourth military dictator, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has made
a critical decision in his 30-month tenure: to jump into the murky,
treacherous waters of Pakistani politics. That this decision was
unnecessary, irrational and not in the country's best interest is now
irrelevant. By announcing that he will seek a five-year presidential
term in a referendum later this month, Musharraf has not just put his
head on the line, he has created a climate of uncertainty that should
alarm the United States and its international allies.</LD>
<LD>   The timing seems, at first, puzzling. While the U.S. and others
have urged Musharraf to restore civilian democracy, in recent months
this has become a more long-term goal. Musharraf has been embraced by
world leaders and welcomed in major world capitals. Pakistan has been
quietly removed from sanction lists, and the flow of international
aid has increased dramatically. Domestically, a pliant judiciary and
press have provided tacit support for Musharraf's policies. And he
had begun taking real steps toward something no one else could have
even attempted: banning extremist religious organizations, curbing
terror-spewing religious schools known as madrasas, purging (though
half-heartedly) rogue intelligence networks and supporting a U.S.-led
war against the Taliban.</LD>
<TE>   So what has pushed him into the muddy world of politics? He is
certainly ambitious. And in recent months he has become
overconfident, intoxicated with power and his newfound respectability
abroad. Finally, though, his decision came not so much because of
what he wants for himself now, but rather with the role he wants to
play on a much larger stage in October, when Pakistan will hold
parliamentary elections. Musharraf is looking for a mandate today
that will guarantee his handpicked candidates an advantage in those
elections. He acknowledges he is taking a huge risk, but argues that
as a military man he is not afraid to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that the risk is not simply Musharraf's--it is
Pakistan's. If he doesn't get a convincing majority in an honest and
open vote later this month, he faces a threat from the religious
fundamentalists he has been trying to stifle as well as from an
increasingly unruly military, which would view his defeat as an
invitation to make trouble. Even a weak vote of support in a
genuinely free and fair referendum would shake his political edifice.
And a rigged vote would compromise his credentials abroad and, more
importantly, weaken his grip on the core of his ruling junta, which
is already pushing for the removal of Musharraf as chief of the army.
Pakistan's major political parties have spoken out against holding a
referendum.</TE>
<TE>   The multi-pronged and difficult war against international
terrorism demands a Pakistani leader committed to identifying and
pursuing the rogue armies of terrorists inside and outside Pakistan.
Initially, Musharraf rose to the occasion, making strong and
unequivocal statements and demonstrating his willingness to act. Not
anymore. Since his thoughts have turned to the referendum, he has
begun making compromises. He has released hundreds of arrested
Taliban fighters and their Pakistani religious mentors. He has
refused to hand Ahmad Saeed Omar Sheikh, the prime suspect in
American journalist Daniel Pearl's murder. He is now breaking bread
with the same corrupt politicians against whom he once waged a
sincere accountability campaign. Lastly, he is cracking down on
Pakistan's tiny but independent print media while blatantly using the
tightly controlled electronic media for his aggressive political
campaigning. In short, from an honest military strongman on solid
moral ground, Musharraf has become a double-speaking
dictator-politician, making fervent, broadly emotional and mostly
hollow appeals for public support.</TE>
<TE>   Washington should be very afraid. The U.S. is pumping hundreds of
millions of taxpayer dollars into Pakistan. It was perhaps wrong in
the first place for Washington to count so much on one man. Now, in a
time of such uncertainty, it becomes crucial that the U.S. reach out
to other potential leaders, developing direct rapport with top
military generals and supporting relatively clean and popular
politicians. The U.S. should encourage the judiciary to act
independently, particularly on issues involving popular but exiled
political leaders. And the U.S. should support a vigorous free press.</TE>
<TE>   If Musharraf is choosing now to be a politician, he must be
pressured to level the playing field for other Pakistani politicians
before the October elections. As Pakistan has witnessed repeatedly,
attempts to use brute military and state force to further the
half-baked political agendas of military dictators have always pushed
the country into instability and chaos. And in today's climate, such
a situation would serve the ends of terrorists and rogue armies.</TE>
<TE>   The best option for the West would be to ask Musharraf not to
demolish himself so soon for so little. He should call off the
referendum now. He has been given another three years of legitimate
rule by the Supreme Court, and he could seek, and likely receive, a
two-year extension. That would give Musharraf time to oversee free
and fair parliamentary elections as scheduled and to grant the
judiciary the independence and responsibility to decide corruption
cases against politicians and generals. It would give him time to
find a new army chief and give up that part of his job in order to
distance the military from politics. Once things are stable,
Musharraf should resign as president and seek election through
constitutional means.</TE>

<HD>Iraq War: The Coming Disaster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IMMANUEL WALLERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>Immanuel Wallerstein is senior research scholar at Yale
University and the author of "The End of the World as We Know It."</BD>
<DL>NEW HAVEN</DL>
<LD>George W. Bush is a geopolitical incompetent. He has allowed a clique
of hawks to induce him to take a position on invading Iraq from which
he cannot extract himself, one which will have nothing but negative
consequences for the United States--and the rest of the world. He
will find himself badly hurt politically, perhaps fatally. And he
will rapidly diminish the already declining power of the United
States in the world.</LD>
<TE>   A war against Iraq will destroy many lives immediately, both Iraqi
and American, because it seems clear that high-altitude,
surgical-strike air attacks will not suffice in military terms.
Invading Iraq will lead to a degree of turmoil in the Arab-Islamic
world hitherto unimagined. Other Arab leaders don't like Saddam
Hussein one bit, but their populations won't stand for what they will
inevitably feel is an unprovoked attack on an Arab state, leaving
leaders with little choice but to be swept along in the turmoil or
drown. And an attack on Iraq might ultimately spark the use of
nuclear weapons, which, if unleashed now, will be hard to again make
illegitimate. Iraq may not have such weapons yet, but we can't be
sure. Even if it doesn't, might it not attack Israel with
conventional missiles that would prompt Israel to respond with the
nuclear weapons we know it has? For that matter, are we really sure
that, if the fighting gets tough, the U.S. is not ready to use
tactical nuclear weapons?</TE>
<TE>   How have we gotten into such a disastrous cul-de-sac?</TE>
<TE>   It seems probable that U.S. military action against Iraq is now
not a question of whether but of when. The U.S. government insists
action is necessary because Iraq has been defying United Nations
resolutions and represents an imminent danger to the world in
general, and to the U.S. in particular. This explanation of the
expected military action is so thin that it cannot be taken
seriously. Defying U.N. resolutions or other international enjoinders
has been commonplace for the last 50 years. I need hardly remind
anyone that the U.S. refused to defer to a 1986 World Court decision
condemning U.S. actions in Nicaragua. And President Bush has made it
amply clear that he will not honor any treaty should he think it
dangerous to U.S. interests. Israel has, of course, been defying U.N.
resolutions for more than 30 years, and is doing so again as I write
this commentary. And the record of other U.N. members is not much
better. So Hussein has been defying quite explicit U.N. resolutions.
What else is new?</TE>
<TE>   Is Hussein an imminent threat to anyone? In August 1990, Iraq
invaded Kuwait. That action, at least, did pose an imminent threat.
The U.S. response was the Persian Gulf War, in which we pushed the
Iraqis out of Kuwait and then decided to stop there--for good
military and political reasons. But that left Hussein in power.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. passed various resolutions requiring Iraq to abandon
nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons and mandated inspection
teams to verify that it had done so. The U.N. also put in place a
variety of embargoes against Iraq. As we know, over the decade since
then, the system of constraints on Iraq put in place by these U.N.
resolutions has weakened considerably, but not totally by any means.</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks ago, Iraq and Kuwait signed an agreement in which
Iraq agreed to respect the sovereignty of Kuwait. The foreign
minister of Kuwait, Sheik Sabah al Ahmed al Jabbar al Sabah said his
country is now "100% satisfied," adding that he had written the
agreement himself. A spokesperson for the United States nonetheless
exhibited skepticism. The U.S. is not about to be deterred simply
because Kuwait is "satisfied." What is Kuwait, that it should
participate in such a decision?</TE>
<TE>   U.S. hawks believe that only the use of force--very significant
force--will restore our unquestioned hegemony in the world. It is no
doubt true that the use of overwhelming force can establish hegemony,
as happened with the United States in 1945. But U.S. hegemony is not
what it once was. The country's economic superiority in the world
between 1945 and 1965 has been replaced with a situation in which the
U.S. economic position is not significantly better than that of the
European Union or Japan. This relative economic decline has cost the
U.S. the unquestioned political deference of its close allies. All
that is left is military superiority. And, as Machiavelli taught us
all centuries ago, force is not enough: If that's all you have, then
its use is a sign of weakness rather than of strength and weakens the
user.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear that, at this point, almost no one supports a U.S.
invasion of Iraq: not a single Arab state, not Turkey or Iran or
Pakistan, not Russia or the great bulk of Europe. There are, to be
sure, two notable exceptions: Israel, which is cheering Bush on, and
Great Britain--or rather its prime minister, Tony Blair, who declared
last weekend in Texas that "doing nothing ... is not an option" with
regard to Iraq. Yet an article in The Observer last month reported
that "Britain's military leaders issued a stark warning to Tony Blair
last night that any war against Iraq is doomed to fail and would lead
to the loss of lives for little political gain."</TE>
<TE>   I cannot believe that U.S. military leaders have drawn a different
conclusion, although they may be more wary of stating that unpleasant
truth to President Bush. Kenneth M. Pollack, formerly of the CIA and
the Iraq specialist on Clinton's National Security Council, says
military action in Iraq would require sending in 200,000 to 300,000
U.S. troops, presumably from bases in either Saudi Arabia or Kuwait,
as well as additional troops to defend the Kurds in northern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. seems to be counting on intimidating its allies into
going along. But after Israel's occupation of West Bank cities, the
remote hope that Saudi (or even Kuwaiti) bases would be made
available to U.S. troops has almost surely disappeared. Turkey
clearly has no interest in defending Iraqi Kurds, since such action
would certainly strengthen the Kurdish movement in Turkey, against
which the Turkish government fights with all its energy. As for
Israel, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon--with Bush's strong support--is
in the process of destroying as rapidly as possible the Palestinian
Authority, which certainly won't help Bush build his anti-Iraq
coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there will be an invasion, which will be difficult if not
impossible to win. The action could well become another Vietnam. Just
as in Vietnam, the war will drag on and will cost many U.S. lives.
And the political effects will be so negative for the U.S. that
eventually Bush (or his successor) will pull out. A renewed and
amplified Vietnam syndrome will be the result at home.</TE>
<TE>   Can no one in the Bush administration see this? A few, no doubt,
but they are being ignored, because Bush is in a self-imposed
dilemma. If he goes ahead with the Iraq invasion, he risks bringing
himself down, like Lyndon Johnson. And a U.S. failure would finally
give the Europeans the courage to be European and not Atlantic. But
those negative consequences to Bush would be in the future, whereas
the negatives of not invading are immediate.</TE>
<TE>   Bush promised the U.S. people a "war on terrorism" that "we will
certainly win." So far, all he's produced is the downfall of the weak
and impoverished Taliban. He hasn't captured Bin Laden. Pakistan is
shaky. Saudi Arabia is pulling away. If he doesn't invade Iraq, he
will look foolish where it matters to him most--in the eyes of
American voters. And he is being told this, in no uncertain terms, by
his advisors on internal U.S. politics. Bush's incredibly high
approval ratings reflect his being a "war president." The minute he
becomes a peace-time president, he will be in grave trouble--all the
more so because of failed wartime promises.</TE>
<TE>   So, Bush has no choice. He will invade Iraq. He has made clear
that the current Middle East crisis will not deter him from this.
Quite the opposite. Sending Secretary of State Colin Powell to the
region is a way of trying to ensure the operation. And we shall all
live with the consequences.</TE>

<HD>What She Saw at the Revolution</HD>
<DH>WILD GINGER A Novel By Anchee Min Houghton Mifflin: 224
pp., $23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELVIN JULES BUKIET</AU>
<BD>Melvin Jules Bukiet is the author of "Strange Fire: A
Novel" and the editor of "Nothing Makes You Free: Writings by
Descendants of Jewish Holocaust Survivors." He teaches at Sarah
Lawrence College.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along march ago, a college friend of mine and his father were
practically the first American visitors to mainland China--after the
Ping-Pong players yet before the diplomats. They were granted entry
because my friend's father was obsessed with China. A suburban
Styrofoam manufacturer, he had applied for a visa every year for
decades before they were available. Why was this man so drawn to
China? Well, during World War II, his job, as a GI stationed in Asia,
was to take cigarettes to our Japanese enemy's guerrilla enemy, Mao
Tse-tung.</LD>
<LD>   From Canton to the Great Wall, people begged to see a talismanic
object my friend's father carried with him. The object that opened
every door in the country--indeed, it had opened the door to the
country--was a blurry 30-year-old black-and-white photograph of the
smiling young soldier sitting on a jeep next to Mao. The magic of
that image came to mind as I read "Wild Ginger," the latest book by
Chinese-born novelist and memoirist Anchee Min.</LD>
<LD>   Like Min's previous works, "Wild Ginger" is set in the era of
China's so-called Cultural Revolution, when Mao was ubiquitous. Every
building was plastered with posters of the sun-like leader, red rays
emanating from his head. Every jacket had multiple Mao buttons pinned
to its breast. Every hand clutched the Little Red Book. And every
individual dreaded the consequences of individualism.</LD>
<TE>   Maple, the teenage schoolgirl who tells "Wild Ginger's" story, is
an independent thinker who regularly suffers the indignities of a
political playground bully named Hot Pepper. She feels like an
outsider to the pervasive belief system. Then a true outsider
arrives, the eponymous Wild Ginger.</TE>
<TE>   Ginger may have the soul of a Maoist--she certainly has the
will--but, unfortunately, she doesn't have the eyes. That's because
her father, a Frenchman who died when she was young, imparted a
distinctly un-Chinese cast to her features. It's one thing when an
adolescent accuses another of looking funny, but it's entirely
different when looking funny means you are the embodiment of a
counter-revolutionary attitude that must be expunged by all
right-thinking people. Any schoolyard is fraught with the desire to
belong, even more so one in the midst of a nation in which students
"studied no other countries besides Russia, Albania, and North Korea
... [and] didn't know where America was." The two outcasts bond.</TE>
<TE>   Maple yearns to adapt to China's extreme version of political
correctness as a way to succeed, but Wild Ginger is a true believer.
She accepts the notion of guilt by birth that deprives her of the
prize she deserves in the district's Mao-Citation Quoting Contest.
Leaving the school world behind, she finds work in a miserable fish
market, scavenging tails, scales and intestines until she detects
thievery in the market, though the thieves' sin may be less a matter
of criminal behavior than of incipient capitalism. Overnight, she
becomes a national heroine. She meets Mao and is suddenly as
talismanic as my friend's snapshot. "By touching her, [people] felt
that they had touched Mao," a condition akin to "attaining the state
of Nirvana for a Buddhist."</TE>
<TE>   Writing with restraint and clarity, Min shows Wild Ginger, now an
official Red Guard, with the power to condemn people to death yet
without the emotional tools to deal with her attraction for
Evergreen, a slightly older Mao-spouting boy. Sex, she believes, is
inappropriately bourgeois for the vanguard. Thus the frustrated
Evergreen turns to Maple while Wild Ginger seethes and eventually
plots to ruin both her former friend and the young man whose love she
scorned.</TE>
<TE>   The final catastrophe of "Wild Ginger" inheres in the lures of
absolutism. Min's lament for wasted years and wasted lives under
tyranny is potent, and the image she creates of a world marching
lock-step is as chilling as her casual mention of "mind-brushing
schools" for those out of step. Unfortunately, her characters seldom
step out of the preordained roles dictated by their allegorical
names. Hot Pepper is diabolic, and Wild Ginger too intense to endure.
Maple is strong, Evergreen steadfast. Only when the latter two
giddily arouse each other with seditiously misused quotations from
the Chairman do they begin to rebel against both the society they are
stuck within and the rigid format of this earnest but didactic novel.</TE>

<DH>JOURNEY BY MOONLIGHT By Antal Szerb Translated from the
Hungarian by Len Rix Pushkin Press:  324 pp., $18 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEY CHAMBERLAIN</AU>
<BD>Lesley Chamberlain is the author of, most recently,
"The Secret Artist: A Close Reading of Sigmund Freud" and "Nietzsche
in Turin."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ayoung European professional before World War II, a businessman of
some kind or a banker, senses something missing in his life and tries
to escape his fate as a member of the grande bourgeoisie. The story
is familiar from early 20th century literature, from Thomas Mann's
"Buddenbrooks" and Italo Svevo's "Zeno's Conscience," and Antal
Szerb's "Journey by Moonlight" belongs among these great ironic
charmers. Published in 1937, it is here rediscovered for the
English-speaking world.</LD>
<LD>   Szerb was born in 1901, the son of a cultivated Budapest Catholic
family of Jewish descent. A polyglot, Szerb became a renowned and
loved scholar of world literature. He published several novels
before, as a result of his blood and a lifelong opposition to
fascism, he died in a forced-labor camp in 1945.</LD>
<LD>   "Journey by Moonlight" is a kind of travelogue, exploring a still
well-heeled, upper-class, self-confident Europe before World War II.
At the same time, through symbolism, it presents bourgeois life as a
spiritual trap. The cultivated protagonist Mihaly is enchanted by old
Europe, but through his passion for ancient religions and a
compulsive desire to confront death, in which he is guided by his
reading of Dante, he is driven to "drop out." Had he been born 20
years earlier, Szerb could have written a novel in which World War I
marked the collapse of the old world.</LD>
<TE>   But what his generation knew firsthand was more the spiritual
crisis when middle-class capitalist life rebuilt itself. In the
novel, Mihaly and his friends Tamas and Eva were too young and too
self-absorbed by decadence to notice the war. They experimented with
religious idealism and the supernatural and fell in love with one
another. Later, obsessed with self-sacrifice, they grew into adults
who embodied the Freudian death wish.</TE>
<TE>   Mihaly marries Erzsi, an exciting and attractive woman of his own
class, to get away from his death wish, and the opening of the novel
finds the couple on honeymoon in Italy. As they move from Venice to
Ravenna, Mihaly tells the story of his youth. Still so powerful, it
induces him to leave his wife and wander about "this country ...
created out of nostalgia, by kings and poets. Italy is the earthly
paradise, but only as Dante saw it; the earthly paradise on the peak
of Mount Purgatory, a mere stopping place on a journey, a
supernatural airport where spirits take off from, the distant circles
of heaven, when Beatrice lifts her veil, and the soul 'feels the
great power of the old yearning.'"</TE>
<TE>   But Erzsi rather resembles her husband psychologically and when
she tracks him down, she understands only too well: "Oh, Mihaly, the
world won't tolerate a man giving himself up to nostalgia." In fact,
Mihaly and Erzsi have the same needs, hence their unsuitability as a
couple. In a memorable solitary scene, Erzsi longs but fails to throw
off the sexual inhibitions of a decent woman. Mihaly does not quite
fail as an anti-bourgeois, but he undergoes a spiritual conversion,
through loyalty to his father, which makes the prospect of a rooted
life bearable.</TE>
<TE>   As I was reading this book, I couldn't help thinking not only of
Mann and Svevo and Freud but also of the communism that was waiting
for Hungary, waiting to sweep away the old bourgeoisie after 1945.
And I thought of the great Hungarian critic Georg Lukacs who, 16
years older than Szerb, came from a similar professional background,
which he renounced. Lukacs, like Szerb's Mihaly, was driven by an
anti-bourgeois quest, but it took a political direction. He became a
communist and probably was the greatest communist critic of world
literature in the 1920s. Deluded about Stalin, he nevertheless
theorized the growth and collapse of high bourgeois life, as seen
through the institution of the novel, and this was his greatest
accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   Szerb's novel, at home in the mountains of Umbria, among the
classical ruins of Rome and in Paris and in Budapest and rich in its
praise for England, is a gentler way than Lukacs' of returning to an
extraordinary junction in Western civilization. It lures us today
because it exudes a lost aesthetic order we still search Europe for.</TE>
<TE>   Despite political tensions, to be bourgeois/anti-bourgeois between
the wars still entailed the cosmopolitan ideal of world citizenship.
Europe offered a civilization which had not grown too large and in
which small city and rural life were compatible. This is Szerb's
imaginative world. So with Mihaly we shiver inside the thick walls of
cool, dark, mysterious peasant dwellings and then return happily to
our small, erotic, old-fashioned hotels, later to review our poetic
worldview in the delicious impersonal solitude of a cafe with good
coffee. Mihaly's eccentricity is to line up death as the ultimate of
life's erotic charms. But I'm not sure translator Len Rix, who, apart
from a sprinkling of anachronisms, has produced a fine, readable
text, is right to call him "daft" and "adolescent." Rix gets it right
when he says Mihaly possesses exceptional intelligence of the heart.</TE>
<TE>   Another, greater novel, like Mann's "The Magic Mountain," would
have balanced Mihaly's nostalgia with the weight of historical
reality. But what Szerb delivers is the spiritual message which, in
the 1910s and 1920s, seduced a Lukacs and, quite different, a Mihaly.
"The academics had taught him that there are degrees of Being, and
that only the Perfect was wholly, truly alive." One has to work at
being alive, and both good and bad institutions get in the way.
Lukacs envisaged getting rid of the capitalist institutions. But
neither communism nor the grand bourgeois life delivered, and how
could they? They were not religious truth.</TE>
<TE>   But what is the religious truth at stake here, which is also a
testament to a lost culture? In his most open and alive moments,
Mihaly feels a chasm opening beneath his feet. An old friend, now a
Catholic priest, teaches him not to fear this moment of horror
metaphysicus, and he is redeemed. Redemption cancels Mihaly's irony
and the story closes hopefully. But as it does, modern readers may
feel how differently the post-bourgeois, post-cosmopolitan world has
shaped up since 1937. Our global, uniform, materialistic world no
longer understands the lure of "degrees of Being" at all.</TE>

<DH>BAD ELEMENTS: Chinese Rebels From Los Angeles to Beijing By
Ian Buruma Random House: 432 pp., $27.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN I. COHEN</AU>
<BD>Warren I. Cohen is the author of "America's Response to
China," "East Asia at the Center" and, most recently, "The Asian
American Century." He is professor of history at the University of
Maryland, Baltimore County.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Do the Chinese hope for the freedoms sought by other peoples all over
the world? Do they want to live under the rule of law, free from
arbitrary government? Do they want to be free to speak out when their
leaders err, when they encounter corrupt officials? Do they want to
be free to worship as they please? Of course they do, but even some
would-be reformers are not sure that democracy is the answer.</LD>
<LD>   In "Bad Elements," Ian Buruma has written a wonderful book about
brave people, some more sympathetic and more appealing than others.
Most of them risked their lives and many of them suffered horribly
because they spoke out against three despotic Chinese governments:
that of the Communist Party ruling mainland China since 1949; that of
the Chiang family's Kuomintang government on Taiwan from the end of
World War II until Chiang Kai-shek's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, opened
the door to an opposition movement in the 1980s; and, not least, that
of Lee Kuan Yew's People's Action Party, or PAP, which has dominated
Singapore since 1963.</LD>
<TE>   Lee is, of course, the foremost articulator of the nonsensical
"Asian values" rationale for denying various human rights. Its
advocates insist that Asians value community and state above
individual freedom and do not want democracy. South Korea's
president, Kim Dae Jung, dismissed such claptrap long ago, as have
the people of South Korea and Thailand and the Chinese of Taiwan and
Hong Kong who struggled for democracy. Buruma has had conversations
with scores of Chinese dissidents from Los Angeles to Beijing and
deftly lets them demonstrate, through the stories of their lives,
just how much the Chinese crave freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Communist Party leaders in China, like those who ruled the country
for centuries before them, reject the concept of a loyal opposition.
Any group offering an alternative to the party line of the moment is
perceived as a threat: the tiny democracy movement, labor advocates,
Tibetan Buddhists, Christians or Falun Gong. Buruma notes that the
party disguises politics as culture: to dissent is to be "un-Chinese"
as well as unpatriotic.</TE>
<TE>   Key to the survival of the Communist Party has been its success in
exploiting divisions in the opposition, nurturing intellectuals'
traditional mistrust of peasants and workers and fostering
conservative reformers' suspicion of the more radical opponents of
the regime. Many Chinese intellectuals fear democracy, however
willing they are as individuals to reject party dogma. Buruma spoke
frequently with Dai Qing, a courageous woman who has been relentless
in her criticism of the environment-wrecking, potentially
catastrophic Three Gorges dam project along the Yangtze River. Dai
insists on her freedom to speak but is skeptical about whether
democracy can work in China. She is a classic conservative reformer,
apparently still dreaming of some form of benevolent
authoritarianism, a variation on the virtuous leader that Confucians
have always sought.</TE>
<TE>   But much as Buruma enjoyed his conversations with Dai, he found
the churlish Wei Jingsheng most persuasive about what is needed in
China. He is not put off by Wei's chain-smoking and badgering
in-your-face personality. This is the man who in 1978 demanded that
Deng Xiaoping grant China democracy--and spent 18 years being
tortured in prison without yielding an inch. For Wei the term
"virtuous leader" is an oxymoron. Men with power have to be kept in
check by democratic institutions. Wherever he can find an audience,
he insists that the Chinese people are ready now.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore is a particularly sad story. No one has ever doubted
that Cambridge-educated Lee is brilliant. But intelligence never
inoculated anyone against arrogance, ruthlessness or stupid behavior.
Buruma recalls the old description of Singapore as a "Disneyland with
capital punishment." Lee's imagined Chinese community is a Potemkin
democracy where everyone is happy, the streets are spotless and
nobody dares spit. Archly, Buruma asks why, despite intimidation,
more than a third of the people voted against Lee's PAP in 1997. And
the world wonders why Lee has found it necessary to hound, imprison
and torture his critics. "The fact that dissidents are called
Communists in Singapore and counterrevolutionaries in China is
incidental; the underlying sentiments of the rulers are the same."</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese found the winning approach in Taiwan in 1978. There,
in the southern city of Kaohsiung, opposition to the Kuomintang
dictatorship came together, radicals and reformists, intellectuals
and workers, and they provoked a savage encounter with the ruling
party. There was no immediate victory for People's Power, as when
Filipinos rid themselves of Ferdinand Marcos or Indonesians brought
down Suharto. But working together over the years, they were able to
wear down resistance to democracy and win a series of political
reforms, ultimately including free elections. In the 2000
presidential election, they forced the Kuomintang to surrender power.
Today Taiwan is a democracy whose people live under the rule of law
and enjoy institutions that guarantee their freedom, not least the
freedom to change their government when it fails them.</TE>
<TE>   Buruma notes that several of the dissidents have turned to
Christianity and that most Tibetans cling to their faith in Buddhism,
but he acknowledges that the spirit never seized him. He sees faith
in Jesus and the Dalai Lama as alternatives to Maoism, not as
harbingers of democracy. He is no more enamored of the faith in
science espoused by physicist Fang Lizhi. The Chinese must question
all dogma and settle for nothing less than freedom of expression.
They must follow Czech President Vaclav Havel's dictum and "live in
truth."</TE>
<TE>   Elegantly written, this collection of interviews and piercing
insights demonstrates that the Chinese, wherever they may reside, are
as eager to be free as any people anywhere and reminds us of the
oppression under which too many of them have lived for too long.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Bad Elements'</TE>
<TE>   We will never know how many people were killed during that sticky
night of June 3 and the early hours of June 4, 1989. A stink of
burning vehicles, gunfire, and stale sweat hung heavily on Tiananmen
Square; thousands of tired bodies huddled in fear around the Monument
to the People's Heroes ....Tracer bullets and flaming cars lit up the
sky in bursts of pale orange. Loudspeakers barked orders to leave the
square immediately, or else. Spotlights were switched off and then on
again. And over the din of machine-gun fire, breaking glass, stamping
army boots, screaming people, wailing sirens, and rumbling APCs,
young voices, hoarse from exhaustion, sang the 'Internationale,'
followed by the patriotic hit song of the year, 'Descendants of the
Dragon':</TE>
<TE>   In the ancient East</TE>
<TE>   there is a dragon;</TE>
<TE>   China is its name ....</TE>

<DH>A SONG FLUNG UP TO HEAVEN By Maya Angelou Random House: 214
pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WANDA COLEMAN</AU>
<BD>Wanda Coleman is a recipient of the 1999 Lenore
Marshall Poetry Prize and was a bronze-medal finalist in the 2001
National Book Awards for "Mercurochrome: New Poems" (Black Sparrow
Press).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While many American poets have languished, regardless of race, creed,
color or excellence, the savvy and ever-seductive 74-year-old
Marguerite Johnson, a.k.a. Maya Angelou, has parlayed statuesque
looks and modest talents as actress-dancer-singer into a 30-year role
on the literary stage that is, indeed, phenomenal. In 1993, at the
behest of President Clinton, she became the second poet in U.S.
history to recite an original poem at an inauguration. Few poets can
spark a smidgen of the controversy generated in 2001 by Angelou's
undisclosed cut of the estimated $50-million in sales for writing
greeting card verse, a pursuit for which she is superbly suited.
Purportedly the final installment of her serial autobiography, "A
Song Flung Up to Heaven," appears only a few months after the first
of her Hallmark card line and seems calculated to encompass
celebrations of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, African American
history month, National Women's month as well as her 74th birthday
this month, National Poetry Month.</LD>
<TE>   It might be assumed that Angelou would take her honorary doctoral
degrees, make a graceful bow and retire from the literary round table
with celebrated reputation intact. Alas, a dignified departure is not
the trait of the greedy when one more traipse to the trough is
offered. Once again, Angelou dips into her past to offer up an
emotional repast that would starve a skeleton.</TE>
<TE>   I vented my bias against celebrity autobiographies at the outset
of a favorable review of Angelou's "All God's Children Need Traveling
Shoes" (Book Review, Aug. 13, 1986), in which I stated that I usually
find them "self-aggrandizements and/or flushed-out elaborations of
scanty press packets." Relieved, I summarized "Shoes" as "a
thoroughly enjoyable segment from the life of a celebrity!"</TE>
<TE>   No can do with "Song."</TE>
<TE>   "Song" is a sloppily written fake, bloated to 214 pages by large
type and widely spaced chapter headings, more than half its 33
chapters averaging two to four pages. Powers exhibited in "I Know Why
the Caged Bird Sings" have deserted her in "Song." Her titillating
confessions and coquettish allusions come off as redundant and hollow
old tricks. She not only engages in her usual name-dropping but
shockingly makes that the book's content. Shamelessly, she
cannibalizes the reputations of three major black figures: Malcolm X
(Al-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz), James Baldwin and King Jr., using them as
linchpins on which to promote her specious pose as an activist.</TE>
<TE>   "Song" opens with Angelou's return to the United States from Ghana
in 1964, a time when she looked to plunk herself into the
sociopolitical fray. She spends time in San Francisco, in Hawaii and
in L.A. (west of the Harbor Freeway, where whites were the majority)
before moving to New York City, living above the concerns of a new
generation of angry young blacks.</TE>
<TE>   With unflinching piety, she skips her days as a dancer and
restyles herself as a militant, fostering the illusion that she was
at the core of the civil rights and black power movements. Rather
than substantiate this, Angelou plays the adolescent game of being
the first to tattle on others when one is guilty: "The same people
who don't give a damn now will lie and say they always supported him
[Malcolm X]." Throughout "Song," Malcolm's name is a mantra as
Angelou smokily extols "the importance of his life and of his death"
without exposition. She has forgotten the swift reliability of the
1960s underground grapevine. Had she joined the Organization of
African-American Unity (I belonged to the Compton branch), it would
have been news coast to coast. The dead (including Malcolm's widow,
Betty Shabazz, who died tragically in June 1997) cannot contradict
her--which may partly explain the 16-year lapse between "Shoes" and
"Song." Meanwhile, Angelou artfully plays the race card, like the
muse Euterpe or Sister Flute, coochie-cooing admirers out of shirts
and socks, transforming bigots into simpering ninnies and academic
cowardice into five-figure honorariums.</TE>
<TE>   If "Caged Bird" put Angelou at the fore of those braving fiction's
devices to enhance their truths, in "Song" she regresses, making it a
textbook example of the danger inherent in that technique:
misinterpretation. For example, taken alone, Chapter 19 might
approximate any single woman's search for work on hostile turf but,
when wedded to Chapter 25, it becomes a "choose" in street
parlance--straight out of novelist Iceberg Slim--making Angelou, in
her 30s, seem less the ingenue ward and more the procurer when
setting up her benefactor with a lady friend.</TE>
<TE>   Ever age-conscious, Angelou relies on innuendo and inference to
blur time, avoiding dates, locales and other details, thus muddling
events, as in "Caged Bird" when recounting the excitement generated
by a Joe Louis fight. Angelou scrambles Louis' June 25, 1935 bout
with Primo Carnera (she was 7) with his June 22 championship bout
with Max Schmeling three years later. Likewise, in Chapter 9 of
"Song," the book's lengthiest, Angelou bizarrely mangles the Watts
riots of August 1965. After exclaiming "the cry of 'burn baby burn'
was loud in the land" in 1964 (the phrase was the signature of KGFJ
disc jockey Magnificent Montague, unheard nationwide until after the
riots), she patronizingly defends residents with whom she is unable
to identify, tiptoeing down to Watts to see the devastation.</TE>
<TE>   In writing that is bad to God-awful, "Song" is a tell-all that
tells nothing in empty phrases and sweeping generalities. Dead
metaphors ("sobbing embrace," "my heart fell in my chest") and clumsy
similes ("like the sound of buffaloes running into each other at
rutting time") are indulged. Twice-told crises (being molested, her
son's auto accident) are milked for residual drama. Extravagant
statements come without explication, and schmooze substitutes for
action. Her most intriguing character, "The African," is
underdeveloped. She softly decries racism in between snipes at those
who marginally offended her during her "rise" (Eldridge Cleaver, a
white woman at a party). Tiresomely, she repeats her mother's
homilies when not issuing her own. There is too much coulda shoulda
woulda.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the Maya Angelou of "A Song Flung Up to Heaven"
seems small and inauthentic, without ideas, wisdom or vision.
Something is being flung up to heaven all right, but it isn't a song.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From 'A Song Flung Up to Heaven'</TE>
<TE>   Rosa and Dolly and I traveled to Stockton to spend a last weekend
with my mother before returning to New York.</TE>
<TE>   She cooked and laughed and drank and told stories and generally
pranced around her pretty house, proud of me, proud of herself, proud
of Dolly and Rosa.</TE>
<TE>   She said black women are so special. Few men of any color and even
fewer white women can deal with how fabulous we are.</TE>
<TE>   'Girls, I'm proud of you.'</TE>
<TE>   In the early morning, I took my yellow pad and ballpoint pen and
sat down at my mother's kitchen table.</TE>
<TE>   I thought about black women and wondered how we got to be the way
we were. In our country, white men were always in superior positions;
after them came white women, then black men, then black women, who
were historically on the bottom stratum.</TE>
<TE>   How did it happen that we could nurse a nation of strangers, be
maids to multitudes of people who scorned us, and still walk with
some majesty and stand with a degree of pride?</TE>
<TE>   I thought of human beings, as far back as I had read, of our deeds
and didoes. According to some scientists, we were born to forever
crawl in swamps, but for some not yet explained reason, we decided to
stand erect and, despite gravity's pull and push, to remain standing.
We, carnivorous beings, decided not to eat our brothers and sisters
but to try to respect them. And further, to try to love them.</TE>
<TE>   Some of us loved the martial songs, red blood flowing and the
screams of the dying on battlefields.</TE>
<TE>   And some naturally bellicose creatures decided to lay down our
swords and shields and to try to study war no more.</TE>
<TE>   Some of us heard the singing of angels, harmonies in a heavenly
choir, or at least the music of the spheres.</TE>
<TE>   We had come so far from where we started, and weren't nearly
approaching where we had to be, but we were on the road to becoming
better.</TE>
<TE>   I thought if I wrote a book, I would have to examine the quality
in the human spirit that continues to rise despite the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Rise out of physical pain and the psychological cruelties.</TE>
<TE>   Rise from being victims of rape and abuse and abandonment to the
determination to be no victim of any kind.</TE>
<TE>   Rise and be prepared to move on and ever on.</TE>
<TE>   I remembered a children's poem from my mute days in Arkansas that
seemed to say however low you perceive me now, I am headed for higher
ground.</TE>
<TE>   I wrote the first line in the book, which would become 'I Know Why
the Caged Bird Sings.'</TE>
<TE>   'What you looking at me for. I didn't come to stay.'</TE>

<DH>SERVANTS OF THE MAP Stories By Andrea Barrett W.W. Norton:
270 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS CURWEN</AU>
<BD>Thomas Curwen is the deputy editor of Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The romance of ruin lies thick upon the pages of Andrea Barrett's
"Servants of the Map." Fossils, scripture, letters, memories, the
dead and the dying open doors to the past with a startling, informed
ease and a poignancy that is matched only by the travails of the men
and women left behind who must ponder the meaning of change and
evanescence of their own lives, lived in the shadow of eternity,
memento mori.</LD>
<LD>   "Servants" is a collection of short stories and novellas in which
Barrett mines, as she did in "Ship Fever" and "The Voyage of the
Narwhal," nothing less than the vastness of the 19th and 20th
centuries to cast a light on the collision that occurred when the
empirical facts of life on the planet suddenly outpaced any ability
to explain or even to know them. Where God and faith once provided
the epistemology, there now existed a void into which science threw
itself in a noble attempt to recover what had been lost.</LD>
<LD>   Taking us from the Age of Reason to the Age of Uncertainty,
Barrett channels the zeitgeists as deftly as British novelists A.S.
Byatt and John Fowles, but her sensibility is American. Her
characters are a beguiling blend of loneliness, resilience and tragic
resignation. Like children expelled from the garden, they wander the
wilderness, trusting that the answers and the knowledge they once had
is attainable again.</LD>
<TE>   Max Vigne wanders the farthest. When we meet Vigne--in the first
story of the collection--the year is 1863, and he is one of the many
surveyors--Servants of the Map, as they are called--attached to the
Grand Trigonometrical Survey of India. He is writing a letter to his
new wife, Clara, back in England, trying to convey the majesty of the
world he is struggling to measure: "Try to imagine," he scribbles
enthusiastically, "the whole chain of the Himalaya, as wide as
England and four times its length."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, though, the altruism of the project fades, and what
emerges in Max is the romantic--if not existential--self picking its
way through the hardship of the world, struggling to know the meaning
of its life. "Who am I? Who am I meant to be? I imagine a different
life for myself, but how can I know, how can anyone know, if this is
a foolish dream, or a sensible goal?"</TE>
<TE>   This unknowing consumes Barrett's characters. Whether it is Vigne
triangulating the subcontinent or Samuel Bernhard, in a later story,
searching for evidence of life before the Flood in the sandstone
cliffs of the Ohio Valley, Barrett's heroes are marked by an
obsessive certainty that the truth belongs to the most tenacious.</TE>
<TE>   It is a course that makes them not a little desperate as they
watch their tenets of faith slowly melt away in a losing struggle to
adequately understand the world. Science tries its hand, but it too
fails. In "The Mysteries of Ubiquitin," a young woman, a molecular
biologist, mourns the death of her mother, clipped as she walked
along a lakeshore road by a speeding motorist. "A hundred times, a
thousand times, Rose would try in the following years to reconstruct
her mother's life and mind, her mother's death. What was science
for," she wonders, "if not for this?"</TE>
<TE>   But Barrett knows that such inquiry is useful in fiction only
if it mirrors a deeper psychology. Her characters--Lavinia in
"Theories of Rain" in 1810, pining for her lost brother, lost when
their parents died and the village found new families to care for
them; Miriam in "Two Rivers" in 1853, remembering the life of her
dead husband, who also became a paleontologist in Ohio; or Bianca in
"The Forest" in 1979, searching for an identity beyond her
family--relive the torments of the past through the courses they
follow in the present.</TE>
<TE>   Science as metaphor, however, is a balancing act, and at times the
pleasures of "Servants" are more of the mind than of the heart,
leaving one to wish for a more sustained narrative. By revisiting
characters from previous work in "Servants of the Map"--Barrett
brings back, as little girls and adults, the Mapson sisters from
"Ship Fever"; a younger Lavinia, who went on to become the botanist
aboard the Narwhal; and Nora Kynd, the child separated from her
family in "Ship Fever"--she leaves us to create our own family trees,
all the more tangled for the fragmented connections among these
stories. Were she to have compiled these threads, as brilliant as
they are, into a longer narrative, we might have had an even more
affecting book than this collection.</TE>
<TE>   In the final story, "The Cure," Vigne reappears in absentia. It's
nearly 40 years later, and his daughter manages an inn in the
Adirondacks for consumptives. Vigne, as we learn, never able to
reconcile ambition with family responsibilities, continued his
wanderings from Kashmir to Venezuela, Japan to Borneo, and his family
reconciled themselves to his absence and their own lives without him.</TE>
<TE>   Time and space course through these stories like a river slowly
eroding its banks and altering the land upon which we stand. As
Barrett's men and women struggle to reconcile the capriciousness of
fate and the elucidating promise of science, they edge closer to a
deeper awareness of their own mortality, and Barrett is wise enough
to know that such journey is not just moving from one place to
another but living toward the final destination.</TE>

<HD>Four Questions for Richard Flanagan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: How did you come to this story?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Ten years ago, I was shown a volume by a convict forger. I
thought of that man, and I wanted to write a book that got into the
eyes of the fish he had painted. But the rest of it is mysterious. In
a certain moment you find a way of expressing both humor and anguish
on a larger scale, and then you are wrenched from this world that you
live in.</LD>
<LD>   Q: And where is that?</LD>
<TE>   A: We live in a clapboard house right in Hobart, an old colonial
city, quite poor, of around 200,000 people. The house is on a hill
that runs down to a river. Behind me is a mountain. My ancestors,
Irish convicts arrested for petty crimes like stealing cornmeal in
the heart of the famine, were among the first settlers. Until the
last 20 years, nobody wanted to talk about Tasmania's terrible
history, the experiences of convicts and the massacres. That's the
dark side. But people now tend to live in big clans. We also have the
largest remaining stand of temperate rain forest in the world,
threatened by developers. I think the literature of the 21st century
is all about the land and getting a sense of one's past. Time is a
river that sweeps me along. People have to forget, but to be truly
free you have to look back.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Were you in control of this novel?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. Never. The moment I'm in control, it's not worth reading.
It has to be exciting for the writer. Look, journalism and historical
writing move outward from yourself. But the fictional journey is in
the opposite direction, dreadful, but occasionally you might get in
there, and that is a moment of transcendence. Your knowing is
fractured in one human breast. You can't control it; you have to
abandon control. Writing this book was like holding sand between my
fingers. And when the book was finished, I had an acute sense of
failure; after all, nothing could be as grand as that great dream. I
feel I've betrayed it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The book is a beautiful object. How did you persuade publishers
to spend so much money on it?</TE>
<TE>   A: I believe in books. I wanted to show the people who say that
books will one day be obsolete that a whole universe can be contained
in a book, exploding with color and words and the promise that books
hold.</TE>

<LD>Surely one of the most eccentric novels to appear in recent years,
"Gould's Book of Fish: A Novel in 12 Fish" by Tasmanian writer
Richard Flanagan, rivals other ambitiously weird fictional works of
our time. From David Foster Wallace's "Infinite Jest" to Thomas
Pynchon's "Mason &amp; Dixon," fictional high fliers have attempted to
slip free of sturdy old realism by summoning the odd alternate
universe, always running the risk that readers will be distracted by
the little man behind the curtain, frantically working the machinery
that supplies the magic. "Gould's Book of Fish" is such an
experiment: by turns enchanting, bemusing and irritating.</LD>
<LD>   Purporting to be the re-creation of a lost manuscript of William
Buelow Gould, an actual convict in the penal colony of Van Diemen's
Land (the original name for Tasmania), the novel reproduces 12
astonishing watercolors of native fish from the actual "Book of
Fish," owned by the Allport Library and Museum of Fine Arts in the
State Library of Tasmania. The chapters are printed in a different
color ink (red, purple, brown, blue, green), corresponding to the
different substances (lapis lazuli, sea urchins, human blood and
feces) that the desperately inventive Gould uses to pen his bizarre
memoir.</LD>
<TE>   Although hardly as melodramatic as his character's, Flanagan's
career has had a picaresque air. Born and raised in Tasmania (where
he still lives), a descendant of Irish convict ancestors who arrived
in the 1840s, Flanagan remembers reenacting his father's experiences
in a World War II Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in Burma while on
seaside holidays as a child:</TE>
<TE>   "In our shack we shared in his annual exorcism," he wrote in an
Austrialian magazine earlier this year. "We six children would line
up and recite one to 10 in Japanese or his number that he had once
called at roll call in jungle camps. He would inspect our bunk beds
to make sure our blankets were folded in the manner decreed by the
imperial Japanese jailers--with the fold out."</TE>
<TE>   A champion whitewater kayaker, Flanagan left school at 16 to work
as a river guide, an unusual apprenticeship for someone who
ultimately became a Rhodes scholar. He subsequently dismissed Oxford
as "the most grossly over-rated institution." He wrote his first
book, a history of southwest Tasmania, at 21, followed by several
more nonfiction works of history and biography.</TE>
<TE>   His first novel, "Death of a River Guide" (1994), was something of
a revelation: A Faulknerian homage in which Tasmania's tragic history
of penal colonies--the rape of its native people and natural beauty
by the British and its subsequent colonization by a welter of
nationalities--is seen through the eyes of a river guide, Aljaz
Cosini, who is drowning beneath a waterfall on the Franklin River,
his life and those of his forebears flashing before him. It was an
astonishing tour-de-force, lyrically written and bringing to life a
place and history that most readers outside of Australia had barely
glimpsed (and might have missed altogether, because the book received
little attention in Australia and was not published here until 2001).</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan's next project involved writing and directing a feature
film about a family of Slovenian immigrants in Tasmania, "The Sound
of One Hand Clapping." While awaiting funding for the film, Flanagan
rewrote the story as a novel, which was published to great acclaim in
Australia in 1997--winning major prizes and selling about 150,000
copies--but the project soured its author on film. Given to
rebellious Russell-Crowe-style outbursts, Flanagan told the press
that movie-making was "the closest thing I've come across to a
tyrannical state" and subsequently revealed that his next novel had
been deliberately written to be "unfilmable."</TE>
<TE>   "Gould's Book of Fish" is that unfilmable book, Flanagan's ninth
work and third novel, an extended peroration on what its central
character terms "Literature &amp; Art, those sick &amp; broken compasses." It
begins with a classic first-person framing device: Sid Hammet is a
modern-day Tasmanian entrepreneur who concocts fake antiques--"old
chairs ... painted in several bright enamel paints, sanded back,
lightly shredded with a vegetable grater, pissed on and passed off as
Shaker furniture that had come out with whalers from Nantucket last
century"--to sell to the "fat old Americans ... with their protruding
bellies, shorts, odd thin legs and odder big white shoes dotting the
end of those oversize bodies." A familiar type in Flanagan's work,
Hammet is eaten away by the corrosive self-loathing and universalized
contempt inspired by this commerce:</TE>
<TE>   "The tourists had money and we needed it; they only asked in
return to be lied to and deceived and told that single most important
thing, that they were safe, that their sense of security--national,
individual, spiritual--wasn't a bad joke being played on them by a
bored and capricious destiny ... that they didn't need to ... have a
bad conscience about their power and their wealth and everybody
else's lack of it; to feel rotten that no-one could or would explain
why the wealth of a few seemed so curiously dependent on the misery
of the many. We kindly pretended that it was about buying and selling
chairs, about them asking questions about price and heritage, and us
replying in like manner."</TE>
<TE>   In just such a black mood, he stumbles across the "Book of
Fish"--a magical manuscript glowing purple--inside a meat safe in a
junk shop and is instantly "washed far away by the stories that
accompanied these fish" and the watercolors that are so vividly
moving that Hammet is convinced its author "felt in colours."</TE>
<TE>   After he reads it, the document dissolves into a puddle of
brackish water on a bar counter, and we're propelled through the
looking glass as Hammet somehow takes on the mantle of the "Book's"
narrator, becoming William Buelow Gould, 19th century petty thief and
forger sentenced to Van Diemen's Land, rotting in a cell below the
high tide line on Sarah Island, the most brutal of the Tasmanian
penal colonies. From this cell, intermittently awash in sea water,
awaiting execution, Gould tells a rollicking tale of disasters
enlivened by the odd drunken binge or sexual peccadillo: His orphaned
childhood in a poorhouse, succored by a pedophile priest; his New
World apprenticeship as a naturalist and artist with "Jean-Babeuf
Audubon" and fraternization with George Keats (brother of the poet);
his transportation to Van Diemen's Land and subsequent escape,
adventures and re-arrest; his terrifying encounters with the insane
gold-masked Commandant of Sarah Island and stolen frolics with the
Commandant's aboriginal mistress, Twopenny Sal; and his probationary
period painting fish for the deranged surgeon Lempriere--"so rotund
he looked as if he had been coopered rather than conceived"--who
hopes to use the paintings to secure his admission to the Royal
Society.</TE>
<TE>   To list Gould's exploits in this fashion, however, gives the false
impression that the story is told in a chronological fashion; in
fact, it's so hallucinatory and fantastical--so often interrupted by
asides or out-of-order recollections--that the reader feels, finally,
buffeted and confused. Gould is another of Flanagan's representative
Tasmanian characters-in-extremis (in his first novel, the protagonist
was dying; here, he's already dead) witnessing horrific misery while
expressing an otherworldly (and ultimately unconvincing) joie de
vivre. But he seems less a fully fleshed character than a messenger
bearing the repetitive news that bad things happened in Van Diemen's
Land. No instance of torture, depravity or brutality has been left
out: Gould and his cohort of fellow prisoners and prison
officials--Lempriere, Capois Death, Pobjoy, the Commandant--suffer or
commit traumatic amputations of virtually every conceivable body
part; wield or endure baroque devices of torture; and seal up in
barrels the decapitated heads of a number of "blackfellas." Nothing
is too outrageous: In an unfortunate echo of Hannibal Lecter, an
enormous swine named Castlereagh attacks and consumes Lempriere,
whose skull is subsequently added to one of the aforementioned
barrels. (Putting a pig in a novel these days is like hanging a
pistol on the wall; you know it's going to eat somebody by the third
act).</TE>
<TE>   The colored typefaces likewise seem a failed experiment, both
technically and thematically. In my copy, the supposedly scarlet ink
(from Gould's blood) is a brownish hue, scarcely distinguishable from
the sepia tone (cuttlefish ink) of the next chapter, but what's worse
is that there seems little justification for such an elaborate feat.
While the reproductions of Gould's fish are integral to the story,
the colored type is typically explained in a throwaway paragraph. The
whole exercise comes to seem self-indulgent. In the purple chapter,
Gould "make[s] no apologies for what is ... both obvious &amp; necessary:
that the prose which follows is also of a similar hue." This invites
the reader to an irresistible observation: that the purpling of
Flanagan's prose--despite its energy and inventiveness--eventually
palls here; there can be only so many repetitions of words like
"fetid" and "putrid"; so many descriptions of "the effluvium of death
... in a miasma from gangrenous limbs &amp; bloody rags of consumptive
lungs"; so many episodes of magical realism transforming Gould into
every other character in the narrative before the weary reader says:
Enough already.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan first encountered the real "Book of Fish" 15 years ago,
but he has said that the novel is not historical: "I dislike
historical novels. I am trained as a historian, and they seem
fraudulent. You can't re-create the past; you can only write a
contemporary novel that uses the past to speak about ideas." There,
perhaps, lies the flaw of "Gould's Book of Fish": It is perilous, if
not impossible, to use novels to "speak about ideas." What's
memorable--even extraordinary--about this book are Flanagan's
aphoristic talent, his imagination and his uncanny ability to channel
the Rabelaisian voices of the great picaresque writers--Fielding,
Sterne, Smollett. But in this particular high-wire act, the author
loses hold of the guy wires: plot and character. Nonetheless, this
strange writer remains unique, one of the novel's most ambitious
talents, one whose every book--success or failure--commands our
attention.</TE>

<HD>Parting the Waters</HD>
<DH>THE BUFFALO SOLDIER A Novel By Chris Bohjalian Crown /
Shaye Areheart Books:  416 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High water does more in Chris Bohjalian's eighth novel than flood
basements, rip up roads and topple bridges. It also rearranges the
characters' emotional landscapes, imprisoning them in mourning and
guilt and, sometimes, carving them an unexpected way out.</LD>
<LD>   Two years before the action of "The Buffalo Soldier" begins, a
flash flood in rural Vermont drowned the 9-year-old twin daughters of
state Highway Patrol Sgt. Terry Sheldon and his wife, Laura, who
works at an animal shelter. Bohjalian, the author of "Midwives" and
"Trans-Sister Radio," describes this tragedy in an interestingly
detached way.</LD>
<LD>   He doesn't enter the parents' minds, much less the girls'. He
downplays the drama. He writes as if he were a journalist who has
interviewed witnesses well after the fact. It's a voice deliberately
at odds with the story it tells, much as the narrator in Gabriel
Garcia Marquez's "Chronicle of a Death Foretold" brings logic to
bear, too late, on events driven by irrational passions.</LD>
<TE>   Laura is unable to give birth again, so after the numbness of
grief has lifted a little, the Sheldons take in a foster child from
Burlington, a 10-year-old African American boy named Alfred. A
neighbor, retired history teacher Paul Hebert, lets Alfred ride his
horse and gives him a book about the Buffalo Soldiers, black U.S.
cavalrymen and infantrymen who helped patrol the Great Plains after
the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   Alfred, a bright but very quiet boy who has shuttled though many
foster homes and hoards food against the likelihood of another sudden
move, warms slowly to the Sheldons but is inspired by one of the
Buffalo Soldiers, Sgt. George Rowe, whose rules for his troops in the
1870s included: "They are to obey orders, but they are to remember
they belong to no one but themselves. There is a difference between a
good soldier and a slave."</TE>
<TE>   Each of Bohjalian's chapters is prefaced with a quotation from
Rowe's letters, military reports of the period or a 1938 WPA
interview with Rowe's widow, Veronica, who was a 16-year-old Comanche
mother of two named Popping Trees when her first husband, fleeing
soldiers led by Rowe, drowned trying to cross a flooded Texas river.</TE>
<TE>   Popping Trees, captured with her children, worked in the 10th
Cavalry's laundry and saw a gentler side of Rowe. "I knew he liked
me," she told the interviewer. "Maybe if I had been older it would
have been harder to like him, given what his uniform meant to my
people. But I ... was still so young. And he was very handsome."</TE>
<TE>   The Rowes' unlikely love story unfolds in counterpoint to the
Sheldons' efforts to create a new family on the ruins of their old
one. Grief has turned husband and wife into near-strangers. Terry is
unable to get past his stereotype of what Alfred, the only black kid
in town, should be--damaged goods. He discovers the food cache and
concludes that the boy is a thief.</TE>
<TE>   Terry meets an attractive young woman, Phoebe Danvers, on a deer
hunting trip. They have a brief and seemingly casual affair--but then
Phoebe turns out to be pregnant, and the previously faithful Terry is
drawn, more than he would have thought possible, by the idea of
starting all over with an unscarred mate and a baby who shares his
DNA.</TE>
<TE>   If "The Buffalo Soldier" has a villain, it would have to be Terry,
but in truth Bohjalian invites sympathy for all his characters, muted
with the same detachment with which he described the girls' drowning.
In the bulk of the novel, he does enter everyone's minds, but the
voice remains his own--varying only slightly from one character to
the next. We notice this particularly in Alfred's case: The expected
slang is mostly absent, and the adult language reinforces our
impression that the boy is mighty mature for a 10-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   At his best, Bohjalian gives us fine-grained detail and
beautifully observed domestic psychology that recalls Jane Hamilton
("A Map of the World"). His pace is leisurely, however, and his
people are so unfailingly decent, intelligent and insightful that we
come to long for some genuinely nasty behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Relief comes, instead, from scenes of Terry on the job, coping
with speeders and foul weather and bloody accidents. Terry may be in
trouble at home, but in uniform he's as brave and resourceful, in his
way, as the other sergeant, Rowe, who Alfred imagines was his
great-great-great-grandfather. Terry and Alfred need each other,
though it takes a final flood--a deus ex machina--to make them
realize it.</TE>

<DH>MY MOTHER'S ISLAND  A Novel By Marnie Mueller Curbstone
Press:  244 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM HILL</AU>
<BD>Adam Hill is a professor of writing and literature at
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether it takes the form of fiction or memoir, a book about a dying
parent imposes some rather stubborn limits upon a writer. The forward
motion of the plot is essentially predetermined and even sadly
familiar (doctors, hospitals, deathbed, mortuary), so that much of
the work's momentum must inevitably derive from a journey through
memory. This can lead to a kind of narrative inertia that is relieved
only when the story revs up toward its inevitable epiphany-laden
closure.</LD>
<LD>   For good writers, such limits are but an inviting challenge, large
looming obstacles to transcend. And it is no surprise that there have
been several books on this subject in recent years, including Michael
Ignatieff's "Scar Tissue" and Rick Moody's "Purple America" though,
perhaps, Philip Roth's exquisitely moving memoir about his dying
father, "Patrimony," best shows how precise attention coupled with
subtle insights vanquish any story's inherent hindrance.</LD>
<TE>   Marnie Mueller is a good writer, and with her semiautobiographical
novel "My Mother's Island," she has written quite a good book about
an adult daughter's struggle to find some source of love for her
dying mother. Sarah has come to the island of Puerto Rico, where her
mother, Reba, is dying of cancer. The novel alternates between a
day-by-day deathwatch told by Sarah and third-person flashbacks of
Sarah's relationship with her mother. This strategy might seem merely
gimmicky were it not for Mueller's keen ability to portray these two
people without easy sentiment or explain them with pop psychology.</TE>
<TE>   Even dying, Reba is a difficult woman to love, unwilling to engage
sincere emotion and showing little more than a formal, aloof
gratitude to her daughter. In Sarah's childhood, Reba was given to
strange fugue states that led to outbursts of physical abuse. Sarah
tells us often that she hates her mother, and caring for Reba in her
last days is a disruptive burden in her life. It leaves her feeling
marooned on her mother's island, and no one, not even her mother's
friends nor Sarah's supportive husband, can provide much comfort.</TE>
<TE>   What occurs, then, is the often painful process of role reversal,
in which humane duty takes precedent over resentment or guilt. Toward
the end, Sarah writes: "She is all bones and loose flesh except over
the huge bloated belly that is now as large as a full-term pregnancy.
She gave birth to me. I am giving death to her. I am bringing her out
of life." So it is in this act of ancient ritual, really, that Sarah
can find some solace. Throughout, there are many moments of harrowing
tenderness, such as when Sarah has to give her mother injections or
shear off her mother's soiled nightgowns. But these things, the
reader comes to understand, are what one has to do to strike a truce
with the past. It is our duty, born of human love, even an
ever-bewildering love.</TE>

<LD>CAN YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?</LD>
<LD>   Picture Puzzles to Search and Solve</LD>
<LD>   By Walter Wick</LD>
<TE>   Scholastic/Cartwheel:</TE>
<TE>   38 pp., $13.95</TE>
<TE>   Walter Wick ("Walter Wick's Optical Tricks" and the "I Spy"
series) unleashes his boundless imagination to devise a dozen playful
picture puzzles, each with a distinct theme. The large-scale
photographs feature a carefully choreographed assortment of
contemporary and vintage toys and other kid-pleasing paraphernalia.
Alongside the images, deceptively simple verse instructs youngsters
to spot specific items. The author cleverly tweaks the game at the
end of each rhyme, inviting readers (sometimes rather cryptically) to
enter a puzzle within a puzzle: They must either follow a maze, match
two sets of objects, find differences in seemingly similar images or
spot an optical illusion. Several of Wick's graphic compositions
stand out as particularly novel: one photo set in a wood shop reveals
freshly carved animal figures, sprinkled with wood shavings; another
assembles hundreds of miniature animals, beads and other objects used
in making play jewelry, all of them translucent and sparkling against
a white background. Even sharp-eyed readers will find some of Wick's
puzzles quite challenging to complete. These pages are nearly
guaranteed to keep kids happily occupied for hours and coming back
for return visits. (All ages)</TE>

<TE>   ONCE UPON A FARM</TE>
<TE>   By Marie Bradby</TE>
<TE>   Illustrated by Ted Rand</TE>
<TE>   Scholastic/Orchard: 32 pp., $16.95</TE>
<TE>   With the gentle cadence befitting a simpler time, Marie Bradby
("More Than Anything Else") harvests a bounty of bucolic imagery for
this poetic look at a family farm. A boy relates the challenges,
never-ending work and sweet rewards that come with working the land.
On each spread, minimalist stanzas ("A plow/some grain/pray for
rain./A sow/a shed/may all be fed") precede a more personal statement
("Mama cooks the corn cakes,/Daddy says the prayer./Sorghum, ham, and
jelly--it's been a good year"). By book's end, the boy sadly shares
the information that encroaching suburban sprawl and development mean
the end of his farm home and way of life. Throughout, Ted Rand
("Sailing Home") alternates between sunny full-page watercolor
portraits showing the boy and his family, whom he depicts as African
Americans, and smaller airy vignettes providing a good sense of the
comfortable rhythms of the proceedings. His parting illustration of a
lone bulldozer razing tall trees brings home Brady's message in a
quietly dramatic style. (Ages 4-7)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SHADOWS</TE>
<TE>   By April Pulley Sayre</TE>
<TE>   Illustrated by Harvey Stevenson</TE>
<TE>   Henry Holt: 32 pp., $16.95</TE>
<TE>   From the beach to the ball field and back again, a boy and girl
search for shadows on a sunny summer day in April Pulley Sayre's
("The Hungry Hummingbird") warm-hearted ode to friendship and the
simple pleasures of the season: "Searching for shadows/we run,
hop!/stare ... /at lots of shadows / here / and / there." Harvey
Stevenson's ("As the Crow Flies") thickly applied acrylics, steeped
in the glow of amber light, picture the friends--one dark-skinned,
one light--as they push their bicycles aside and run toward the
ocean. The rhythms emulate the narrator's observations, from the
darting motions in nature ("Dragonfly shadows zip and pop./Running
horse shadows never stop") to the humor to be found at the ball field
("A man keeps a shadow under his hat"), while the artwork zeros in on
the winged dragonfly and pulls back to create depth on the baseball
diamond. In a roundly satisfying conclusion, the end of the day finds
the friends at rest under a tree, making twin shadows with their
toe-touching feet: "I think I like these shadows best." (Ages 3-7)</TE>

<TE>   DAUGHTER OF VENICE</TE>
<TE>   By Donna Jo Napoli</TE>
<TE>   Random/Wendy Lamb:</TE>
<TE>   276 pp., $16.95</TE>
<TE>   Donna Jo Napoli returns to the locale of "Stones in Water" and
"For the Love of Venice," this time for a costume drama set in the
late 16th century. At 14, Donata Mocenigo and her twin sister watch
carefully as their noble parents set about finding a husband for
their older sister. Venetian economics dictate that one daughter of a
noble family will surely wed, but only with luck will a second
daughter be married; the remaining daughters either enter convents or
care for a married brother's children. Eschewing a traditional
romance, Napoli forges a plot with contemporary elements. Donata
wants to see Venice and receive the same education as her brothers;
she studies the family business and embraces what facts she can
uncover about Venetian history and politics. Obtaining a
working-class boy's clothes, she disguises herself and sets out on
furtive daytime explorations of her beloved city. Soon she is
befriended by an attractive young Jewish boy, who helps her find a
morning job as a copyist (even though she can't read or write); with
help from her sisters, her escapades go unnoticed by her parents.
Enjoying the tour of historical Venice and the taste of its complex
society and government, readers may not mind Donata's seeming
immunity to the mores and prejudices of her day, not even when, to
avoid an arranged marriage, she anonymously and falsely denounces
herself as a convert to Judaism and still earns herself a happy
ending. (Ages 10-up)</TE>

<TE>   HEY YOU! C'MERE</TE>
<TE>   A Poetry Slam</TE>
<TE>   By Elizabeth Swados</TE>
<TE>   Illustrated by Joe Cepeda</TE>
<TE>   Scholastic/Levine: 48 pp., $15.95</TE>
<TE>   Everyone's a poet, according to this exhortative poetry reading
and street-theater combo: "You've got a poem in your pocket,/A poem
on your tongue, did you know that?/You can be the poet and you can be
the poem too./Yesssss!" To prove it, seven young poets roam their
city block on a summer day, using ordinary situations as material for
syncopated storytelling. The players' portraits and names appear in
the table of contents, so that each one is identifiable during their
improv. Ratchit, a bold prankster, repeats a tough kid's threat ("Hey
you, c'mere,/Whatsa matter witcha"), while his friend Jacob describes
a timid reaction to bullying in "A Good Cry." Mattie mimics her
mother's phone voice--"Yeah, uh huh, uh huh"--in a song. While Doria
creates a nonsense riff on "Silly Names" ("Mr. Grub T. Mudstuck,
Diane Doobey Doo,/Fineas Figmuff and Tina Tutoo ..."), Ratchit sneaks
off to play a joke on the group; after his ghostly noises inspire his
friends' frightened poem, "Monsters," Ratchit laughs, then composes a
reiterative "Sorry." Elizabeth Swados, author of the musical play
"Runaways," crafts an upbeat series of poems and dramatic asides.
Using a crackling-hot palette of orange, summer green and
blue-violet, Joe Cepeda ("What a Truly Cool World") limns a vibrant
cityscape and brings out the strong personalities of the multiracial
group. The slangy words and upbeat visuals suggest that poetry
happens in casual conversation and friendship. (Ages 6-12)</TE>

<LD>To the editor:</LD>
<LD>   In an otherwise interesting review of two recent books concerning
convicted former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee (Book Review, March
31), Michael Parks states inaccurately that "whether there was ever a
leak of nuclear weapons secrets appears very uncertain, at least from
what we can gather from the public record."</LD>
<LD>   To the contrary: The U.S. intelligence community twice has issued
public statements that the People's Republic of China acquired
nuclear warhead secrets by espionage. What is uncertain is Lee's
connection, if any, to this theft.</LD>
<TE>   In a passing reference to the report issued by the Select
Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns
with the People's Republic of China, which I chaired, Parks also
neglects to mention two salient facts. The first is that the report
nowhere mentions Wen Ho Lee, whose case was not the subject of the
report. The second is that the report was bipartisan and unanimous--a
rarity in Washington during the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Parks properly attributes the deep-seated defects in the Lee
prosecution to a "political frenzy" that grew as the 2000
presidential campaign shaped up. The over-indictment of Lee and the
highly irregular public flogging of his case by the secretary of
Energy were indeed evidence of a purely political reaction by the
Clinton administration and Justice Department to the very legitimate
concerns that had surfaced about the lack of adequate security at the
nation's nuclear weapons laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   When Energy Secretary Bill Richardson fired Lee in a very public
and unusual way (and the administration simultaneously leaked Lee's
name, which no member of Congress had ever heard, to the New York
Times) I immediately criticized the apparent scapegoating as
"un-American." A full year before Lee was indicted, I warned--as "60
Minutes" has accurately reported--of the risk that he could become
another Richard Jewell. Such was the vast difference, as I saw it,
between the problems highlighted in the Select Committee's
investigation and the subsequent Lee case.</TE>
<TE>   It is right, and important, to criticize improper conduct by law
enforcement and government officials. At the same time, we should not
lose sight of the fact that the nuclear weapons labs are the subject
of constant espionage. Just as important as protecting innocent
Americans from overzealous law enforcement is protecting them from
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</TE>

<DH>SCROLLING FORWARD Making Sense of Documents in the Digital
Age By David M. Levy Arcade: 272 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX SOOJUNG-KIM PANG</AU>
<BD>Alex Soojung-Kim Pang is a research manager at the
Institute for the Future, a Silicon Valley think tank, and the author
of "Empire and the Sun: Victorian Solar Eclipse Expeditions."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I received word I would be reviewing "Scrolling Forward," I went
to my local bookstore to pick up a copy. I had forgotten the title. I
asked at the information desk about the book, which had been on the
New Science and Technology table the previous weekend, had orange and
blue on the cover and was about documents.</LD>
<LD>   The people at the information desk couldn't remember the title
either, but they remembered the book and knew the most likely place
where half a dozen copies had been moved. So despite not knowing the
author or title, we found it in a matter of seconds.</LD>
<LD>   Drawing on knowledge of a book's recent location, jacket design,
general subject and the way books circulate between display tables
and shelves to find a particular volume may seem disorganized and
baroque. It is, but it's how most of us work. Our complicated
relationship with documents--everything from Post-Its to
encyclopedias--is the subject of David Levy's "Scrolling Forward:
Making Sense of Documents in the Digital Age."</LD>
<TE>   Levy, a doctoral computer scientist and calligrapher, is well
placed to compare the old and new. His book is organized around broad
subjects--reading, writing and the like--but each chapter is a
meditation, written more on the "this reminds me of that" principle,
than according to something more formal. Such an approach can
occasionally get out of control, but at its best the book's style
effectively juxtaposes printed and electronic documents and
calculates the gains and losses of moving information from one medium
to the other.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Levy is interested in this question indicates a
growing maturity in our attitudes toward digital materials. A decade
ago, the first important works on hypertext and multimedia--George P.
Landow's "Hypertext" and Jay David Bolter's "Writing Space"--declared
that, thanks to the computer, the author was dead, the reader reigned
supreme, the book was doomed and linear thinking was passe.</TE>
<TE>   They were widely praised within academic circles and provoked
defenders such as Sven Birkerts to assert the eternal value of the
book. The debate that has followed has largely been beside the point,
because it misses several things that Levy wisely considers in depth.</TE>
<TE>   First, arguments over "the future of the book" focus on books,
particularly high literature. But we live in a world saturated with
texts: We might not read Dante every today, but we'll read street
signs, scan newspapers, select from restaurant menus, answer e-mail,
ignore ads, type URLs.</TE>
<TE>   To drive the point home, "Scrolling Forward" begins not with a
discussion of encyclopedias or the Bible, but with a deli receipt.
Even something so utterly inconsequential turns out to draw upon
thousands of years of history and complex social institutions, not to
mention a host of technologies.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the centuries a complex network of institutions and
practices has grown up to create and maintain meaningful and reliable
paper documents," Levy argues. This is as true of receipts as it is
of Rilke: "To be a receipt is to be connected to cash registers,
sellers, buyers, products, expense reports, the IRS, and so on." It
takes a village to make a document.</TE>
<TE>   Levy's receipt was a hybrid, a printed record generated by an
electronic system; therein lies a second big point. It turns out that
documents have sloshed between electronic and printed form for
decades. Checks and airline tickets were computer-printed from the
1950s. Mainframe computer publishing systems were developed in the
1960s and 1970s for newspapers and other high-volume publishers. (It
is instructive that the early adopters weren't book publishers but
companies that had high-volume, varied or rapidly changing material.
The Encyclopaedia Britannica's publishing system was adapted from one
developed for the Jehovah's Witnesses, who publish countless
pamphlets in dozens of languages.) In the 1980s, word processors
allowed writers to create digital texts. In the 1990s, Web browsers
gave readers direct access to digital works. This last and
most-publicized step was a culmination, not a revolution. Seen in
this light, the whole print versus digital debate seems irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the debate over "the future of the book" took off in
the last decade suggests that what's at stake isn't just materials
but practices and cultural institutions. We pick up cues about the
utility and reputability of printed sources from the publisher, the
feel of the paper, even from a document's location in a library or
bookstore; such cues have yet to be reproduced consistently online,
and the social networks that add value to printed works weren't
threatened by the computerization of typesetting and printing.</TE>
<TE>   Documents, Levy argues, aren't just information; they're also
material things and cultural artifacts. Even digital documents aren't
"just" immaterial bits. As Levy notes, "the ones and zeros of our
digital representations ... are embedded in a material substrate no
less than are calligraphic letter forms on a piece of vellum."</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say that an electronic document can't have all the
qualities of a printed one. It is to say, however, that those
qualities can't be programmed as features in the next upgrade: They
have to be created in the social world and in the world of human
practices and attitudes. Levy wants us to recognize that books and
journals are much more than containers from which content can now be
"liberated." They have influenced-- often to the good--the way we
read, organize our thoughts and create order in our intellectual
worlds.</TE>

<BD>Tony Platt is a professor of social work at Cal State
Sacramento and is researching the history of the Huntington Library.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Between the world wars, Southern California was a hotbed of eugenics
activism. A Pasadena think tank with the Orwellian title of the Human
Betterment Foundation lobbied for compulsory sterilization laws and
forged a mutual admiration society with its counterparts in Nazi
Germany. Professors from Caltech and USC worried about the high
birthrate among Mexican "peon type" families. In Los Angeles, the
Institute of Family Relations vetted young couples' biological
compatibility for marriage.</LD>
<LD>   The proponents of eugenics were not obscure cranks but the best
and brightest representatives of the small elite that dominated
Southern California until the 1950s. The Human Betterment Foundation
enjoyed the active support of banker Henry Robinson as well as social
scientist William Munro and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Robert
Millikan, all of whom also served on the board of trustees of San
Marino's Huntington Library, one of the country's most exclusive

<TE>   Eugenics found wide support in Europe and the United States from
the last part of the 19th century through the first third of the
20th. It was based, according to its founder, English scientist
Francis Galton, on a desire to improve the human stock by giving "the
more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing
speedily over the less suitable." Its earliest proponents in the
United States used eugenics to promote their beliefs in the genetic
superiority of Nordic civilizations over "backward" peoples, namely
all others, and to express their anxiety about the degeneration of
middle-class Aryans through a declining birthrate and miscegenation.</TE>
<TE>   Though the movement to improve the human species through the
scientific use of heredity ebbed in the wake of Nazism, it has been
revived recently in debates on the racial basis of intelligence,
sociobiology and human genetic engineering.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1907 and 1940, more than 35,000 involuntary sterilizations
were carried out by the U.S. government on poor women, mostly in
California. But these efforts paled next to the deeds of the Nazi
regime. Under the 1933 Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased
Offspring, the Third Reich compulsorily sterilized about 400,000
victims, broadly categorized as "socially unfit by virtue of
defective biology." It was the top of a slippery slope that led to
the killing of 100,000 mentally ill patients and then to the
mass-produced butchery of millions. For eugenicists, sterilization
was not so much a technical procedure to enhance physical and mental
health as it was a way to cleanse the body politic of racial
impurities.</TE>
<TE>   "The Unfit" and "Building a Better Race" are useful but
problematic additions to a growing revisionist literature on the
topic. The canon under challenge was established by Mark Haller in
his 1963 book "Eugenics" and in Daniel Kevles' authoritative study,
which appeared first as an essay in the New Yorker, then as a 1985
book, "In the Name of Eugenics." Kevles argues that, by the
mid-1930s, the right-wing version of eugenics "had generally been
recognized as a farrago of flawed science." After World War II,
according to Kevles, biologists managed to repudiate Nazi
pseudoscience and reestablish human genetics as a "solid field of
science that would explain the complexities of human heredity and
assist medicine by illuminating the relationship of genetics to
disease."</TE>
<TE>   Feminist historian Wendy Kline and genetics expert Elof Axel
Carlson take issue with the position that eugenics was a short-run
fad. "The 'golden age' of eugenics," argues Kline, "occurred long
after most historians claim the movement had vanished." They place
their arguments in a grand sweep of history: Carlson from Deuteronomy
to gene therapy, Kline from Teddy Roosevelt to family values, as her
book places eugenics in turn of the century angst about changing
gender roles and fears of "race suicide" by white middle-class
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Carlson, who teaches biology at the State University of New York
at Stony Brook, looks at his profession's moral responsibility for
contributing to the myth of "degeneracy theory." His book's
publisher, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, was home
base for many years to Harry Laughlin, the "notorious representative"
of eugenics, who was awarded an honorary doctorate in medicine by the
University of Heidelberg in 1936 for his contributions to Nazi racial
science.</TE>
<TE>   The authors caution against a conspiracy-minded view of eugenics
as a "unilateral conservative social movement." Kline argues that it
enjoyed broad appeal among reformers, feminists and professionals and
that it was a "tenacious and popular ideology." Carlson finds "many
strange bedfellows" in its ranks.</TE>
<TE>   This was certainly true in California. The Human Betterment
Foundation also counted among its supporters banker Charles Goethe,
Stanford University chancellor David Starr Jordan, Los Angeles Times
Publisher Harry Chandler and self-taught biologist Paul Popenoe, who
became famous for his advice in the Ladies' Home Journal to readers
asking, "Can This Marriage Be Saved?"</TE>
<TE>   Kline and Carlson share the view that supporters of eugenics had a
perverse obsession with regulating sexuality. To Carlson, it was male
masturbation that "served as the first theory of degeneracy," and he
cites research done at an Indiana prison in the early 1900s by Harry
Clay Sharp, a doctor who sterilized 176 men "solely for the purpose
of relief from the habit of masturbation." On the other side of the
country at about the same time, reports Kline, psychologists and
doctors tried everything from quarantine to sterilization to ensure
that the licentious "feeble-minded" woman did not reproduce
"high-grade morons." By the 1930s, Dr. Robert Latou Dickinson, a
leading eugenicist and former president of the American Gynecological
Society, was advising his colleagues to consider sterilization for
women with engorged genitalia, a sure sign of a propensity to "sexual
pathology."</TE>
<TE>   Carlson quickly abandons the link between eugenics and sexuality.
Kline, on the other hand, devotes her book to the insight that
eugenics was aimed at containing women's erotic independence and
restricting their sexuality to reproduction. In the two years after
the close of World War I, 30,000 "khaki-mad girls" were arrested near
military bases in this country on suspicion of promiscuity and
prostitution. For eugenicists in the 1920s, women classified as
mentally ill "symbolized the danger of female sexuality unleashed"
because they threatened to reproduce defective children.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1940s, Kline continues, eugenicists reinvented themselves
as family counselors, promoting "marriage and motherhood as a central
goal of womanhood." They drew upon the homophobic research of
psychologist Lewis Terman "to create rigid standards of masculinity
and femininity as a way of shoring up traditional gender roles and
family patterns." By the 1980s, Kline concludes, the New Right's
campaign for "pro-life, pro-chastity, and pro-motherhood" represented
an updated version of the old eugenics agenda. She notes that in the
front ranks of today's campaign for responsible fatherhood is
sociologist David Popenoe, son of the leading American eugenicist of
the 1920s, whom she says inherited part of his father's obsession
with "reproductive morality."</TE>
<TE>   Kline has a powerful argument that today's right-wing
preoccupation with family morality is rooted in the eugenics movement
of the 1920s. She weakens it, however, with sparse and selective
evidence. She makes a point of stressing that her analysis is
relationship-based, not focused only on women. But, except for a
brief discussion of homosexuality, men's sexuality is not addressed.
Kline asserts, no doubt correctly, that eugenics had a "powerful
appeal to generations of Americans," but she fails to show how it
achieved popular acceptance. More significant, after promising that
her book will address "anxieties about race and gender" in the
eugenics movement, Kline abandons one of those two goals. We learn,
for instance, little about the racist assumptions of eugenics or how
sterilization policies were differentially applied nationwide or
about the staggering numbers of Puerto Rican and American Indian
women who were sterilized in the 1960s and 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The authors diverge in their approach and conclusions. Carlson's
folksy prose brims with irrelevant detours, rambling footnotes and
idiosyncratic opinion. (For some reason he thinks this country is
"largely a classless society.") As a biologist and amateur historian,
he should not be expected to be familiar with arcane journal
articles, but there is no excuse for ignoring the last decade's
scholarship on eugenics. By contrast, Kline promises more than she
delivers. Her slim 164 pages of text do not provide enough texture
and evidence to back up her thesis. Because her insightful
theoretical framework is draped over rather than integrated into her
analysis, the reader is required to read between too many lines.
Pity, because her core idea is provocative and her research opens up
new lines of investigation. The strength of Kline's book is that it
makes connections in social policy we might otherwise miss. It alerts
us to the thread of continuity from Victorian doctors who feared that
it had become "sex o'clock in America," to proponents of "family
values" hawking the dangers of moral decay. I am much more persuaded
by Kline's wake-up call than I am by Carlson's reassurance that "we
have taken charge of our health, of our reproduction, of our
psyches."</TE>

<LD>TWO GARDENERS</LD>
<LD>   A Friendship in Letters</LD>
<LD>   By Katharine S. White and Elizabeth Lawrence</LD>
<TE>   Edited by Emily Herring Wilson</TE>
<TE>   Beacon Press: 274 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   Following her book, "Onward and Upward in the Garden" and her
column of the same name that ran in the New Yorker from 1958 until
her death in 1977, Katherine White's fans were legion. After her
first column in March 1958, White (then 62) received a warm and
appreciative letter from Elizabeth Lawrence, herself a garden writer,
author of "The Little Bulbs" and, later, "The Southern Garden."
Lawrence was 54. Their correspondence in the first year of their
friendship was formal but burning with a passion for gardening and
the joy of sharing sources and tips. White's garden was in Maine,
Lawrence's in North Carolina. Both show an endearing carefulness
about intimacy, each apologizing profusely when some new privacy is
revealed. Lawrence recalls her grandmother, who scorned people for
being "too d--- friendly." Nonetheless, their private lives intrude
on their gardening. Births and deaths and illnesses become part of
the correspondence. They meet once, in New York for lunch, in April
1967, but it has none of the moment of the letters. "Help! Help!"
White writes to Lawrence in 1969. "I'm trying to find how often the
old-fashioned Night-blooming cereus opens its white flowers at
midnight ... in order to capture an event of my quite young
childhood." What are friends for?</TE>

<TE>   SULTRY CLIMATES</TE>
<TE>   By Ian Littlewood</TE>
<TE>   DaCapo Press: 248 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   As in real life, ideas are usually more exciting than their
execution. Traveling for adventure, including the sexual kind, is one
of those dirty little secrets tourists rarely admit to. "Letters
home," writes Ian Littlewood, "commonly tell of the churches visited,
not the brothels." Littlewood begins with an account of the Grand
Tour, and James Boswell's in particular. Undertaken when Boswell was
22, in 1763, it began chastely in Utrecht, the Netherlands, but ended
in a frenzy of sexual encounters in Italy. Littlewood then follows
Margaret Fuller on her journeys in the mid-1800s: "Once I was almost
all intellect; now I am almost all feeling." He continues with Lord
Byron's travels and rebellion against everything Victorian, Andre
Gide's travels in North Africa, Paul Gauguin's in Tahiti and many
others. "Sultry Climates" is a breathless book, a Grand Tour in and
of itself.</TE>

<TE>   BODY HEAT</TE>
<TE>   Temperature and Life on Earth</TE>
<TE>   By Mark S. Blumberg</TE>
<TE>   Harvard University Press:</TE>
<TE>   236 pp., $22</TE>
<TE>   There's a little twinkle in Mark S. Blumberg's eye as he explains
the role of temperatures in life on Earth, that essential gleam that
makes books about science successful and appealing rather than dull
and exclusive. Because temperature presents our greatest
environmental challenge, it seems important to understand its
properties. Blumberg explains what temperature is and its ways of
moving: conduction, radiation, evaporation and convection. He
explains the concept of surface area--skin, tree branches, lungs and
alveoli--and the effect of temperature on genes, sex determination,
the brain, the heart and blood, as well as the role of fevers in
fighting disease. He writes a bit about the future, though this is
not a book on global warming: "[I]t may be possible," he writes, "to
use the gravitational energy of a large asteroid to nudge the Earth's
orbit outward just enough to increase its distance from the Sun and
thereby maintain Earth's temperature at a suitable level." His
writing is clear, a fine balance of explanation, example and ideas.</TE>

<TE>   MADNESS</TE>
<TE>   A Brief History</TE>
<TE>   By Roy Porter</TE>
<TE>   Oxford University Press:</TE>
<TE>   234 pp., $21.95</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, insanity was thought to be caused by some divine
interference: God or Satan. Then came the Age of Reason, when the
world was divided into rational and irrational, feeling and
consciousness. The more early scientists and philosophers learned
about the body, the more madness was described as something organic,
related to the humors and the organs. Finally, madness was located in
the mind, melancholy and mania both. This is the cosmography of
insanity that the late Roy Porter presents in his brief and
fascinating history of insanity. Efforts to control madmen and
-women, from dunking them in cold water to restraint to confinement
and finally drugs are also charted here. Porter describes the first
asylums in Europe and the United States, the pioneers in the field
and the horrifying rise, even as the study of mental health grew, in
the sheer numbers of depressed and deranged people. What has caused
this leap? Porter leaves the reader wondering, waiting for the next
chapter in the future of madness.</TE>

<LD>2182 kHz</LD>
<LD>   By David Masiel</LD>
<LD>   Random House: 296 pp., $22.95</LD>
<TE>   The title of David Masiel's thrilling first novel refers to a
radio frequency reserved for distress signals at sea. Similarly,
Masiel's story of a sailor adrift in his own uncertainty amid the
deadly floes of the Alaskan Arctic is like an extended distress call
from the human soul. For the wandering Henry Seine--unlucky in
marriage and plagued by gauzy visitations from his late father and
other perished associates--work on the open sea offers a
head-clearing alternative to the earthbound chores of love and
family, yet it also means brain-dulling grunt work on drilling barges
and the persistent threat of bodily harm. Still, the siren beckons,
especially after Henry receives a Dear John letter from his wife back
in Seattle. "More than ever he felt convinced he had no business
among normal people ...." Henry's salty comrades are far from normal.
They're the kind of chemically tweaked eccentrics we recognize from
the inspired work of Thom Jones and Denis Johnson: Instead of
Queequeg and Ahab, Masiel gives us the Big Man, a 6-foot, 8-inch Slav
obsessed with the fate of his own excrement, and the Chemist, a
paranoid, profanity-spewing tugboat captain. As a modern Ishmael,
Henry goes along for the ride until he picks up a distress call from
a scientist stranded on a disintegrating ice island. When Henry
decides to rescue this Arctic castaway with a hamstrung tugboat and a
crew of misfits, "2182 kHz" really begins to send out soul-stirring
signals. Masiel expertly lays bare the hazards--and necessity--of
redemption against the cruelest of emotional and physical
environments, and his exacting, lyrical reportage--filled with
H-bitts, fiddley decks and tabular bergs--is worthy of John McPhee.</TE>

<TE>   THE TROUBLE WITH CATHERINE</TE>
<TE>   By Andes Hruby</TE>
<TE>   Dutton: 214 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   CeCe Lacey's fiance is Prince Charming: He's tall, comes from a
WASPy New York family, is about to be made partner at a white-shoe
law firm and actually likes to jog. But there are red flags: For
instance, Steve--the fiance--doesn't know that the Moorish idol fish
belongs in an aquarium, not on a dinner plate. This is a pretty big
deal for CeCe: At 29, she's running the thriving family business down
at Fulton Fish Market. While Steve is proud of his bread-winning
future wife, he's increasingly put off by her tomboyishness and her
penchant for saying the truth at cocktail parties. For CeCe, Steve's
snobbishness and superficiality prove that he doesn't love her for
who she really is. But just who is she really? It's not clear if
Andes Hruby knows or if she's coyly showing us that identity is as
messy as gutting a fish. CeCe, despite her independence and her gutsy
sexuality, harbors some vintage "Cathy"-esque hang-ups: about her
looks, her past and her need for validation through a wedding
announcement in the New York Times. But the confusion only makes
Hruby's Bridget Jones all the more attractive as Hruby goes about
demolishing the already flimsy fairy tale of the perfect partner. In
the end, the newly single CeCe--fishmonger and spouse-seeker--touches
on a suitable many-fish-in-the-sea lament: "It just seems like I
can't separate the good buys from the bad bargains."</TE>

<TE>   THE SUMMER FLETCHER</TE>
<TE>   GREEL LOVED ME</TE>
<TE>   By Suzanne Kingsbury</TE>
<TE>   Scribner: 300 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   About halfway through this absorbing novel of nascent love, racial
tension and criminal secrets, Haley Ellyson, 16 and falling hard for
the son of the county judge, muses about Fourth of Julys past, of
"[c]heap, dangerous fireworks that take off people's fingertips and
blow their eardrums." Suzanne Kingsbury packs her debut full of
bittersweet moments that contain real danger under a taut surface of
nostalgia and adolescent yearning. Haley is one of Kingsbury's two
narrators; the other is Fletcher Greel, the judge's son, 18 and back
home in Houser Banks, Miss., after graduating from boarding school up
north. What unfolds over this sticky Delta summer is the story of
Haley and Fletcher's shared collision course with True Love; of their
friendship with Riley and his secret black girlfriend Crystal; and of
Haley's sketchy knowledge of a murdered black man buried deep in the
woods on her property. While the four friends spend lazy afternoons
at the swimming hole, their Arcadian summer is continually tarnished
by brutality: Riley's redneck cousin threatens to expose Riley and
Crystal's illicit romance; Fletcher is continually targeted as a
Yankee; and Haley can't muster resistance to the advances of Bo
Dickens, a middle-aged family friend who just may be the killer.
Throughout, Kingsbury gives us a Southern landscape glazed in honey;
it's a seductive backdrop for the innocence-dashing lessons these
four teenagers learn together, lessons that may take a lifetime to
unlearn.</TE>

<HD>The Way We Live Now</HD>
<DH>ANNA IN THE AFTERLIFE  A Novel By Merrill Joan Gerber
Syracuse University Press /  Library of Modern Jewish Literature:
124 pp., $22.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MERLE RUBIN</AU>
<BD>Merle Rubin is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merrill Joan Gerber is not only one of our most underrated
contemporary writers, she may well be our least pretentious. Her
utter lack of pretense is a major source of her raw power as a
writer, and it may also be one reason her work has not gained as much
attention as it deserves.</LD>
<LD>   Gerber's literary career has been all over the map. She started
out promisingly in the 1960s with fellowships, prizes, publication in
the New Yorker, a strong collection of stories, "Stop Here, My
Friend" (1965), followed two years later by an affecting first novel,
"An Antique Man."</LD>
<LD>   As her stories found their way into such magazines as Redbook,
however, she became typecast as a "women's writer." Increasingly, she
found it difficult to get published in an industry ever more obsessed
with the bottom line. Yet she continued writing: novels that were not
published and several novels for young adults that were. Repeatedly
rediscovered by readers as diverse as Cynthia Ozick, Margaret Drabble
and Robert Stone, Gerber's fiction found new outlets: University of
Illinois Press; Pushcart Press which published her searing portrait
of an abusive love-match, "King of the World"; Longstreet Press; and,
most recently, Syracuse University Press.</LD>
<TE>   A woman's writer. A young-adult writer. A Jewish writer. A
commercial writer. A literary writer. Yet beneath these fluctuating
labels, Gerber has been consistently engaged in a single endeavor:
writing plainly, unflinchingly and searchingly about what goes on
around her.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Brooklyn who came of age in Florida, Gerber has spent
most of her adulthood in Southern California, transforming the raw
material of family life into fiction that carries the sting of its
sources. She is a powerful realist who seldom shrinks from depicting
the harder facts of life--sexuality, infatuation, financial
anxieties, resentments and rivalries. But unlike some postmodern
realists, such as Ann Beattie, who chronicle events in a detached,
deadpan manner, Gerber takes the reader inside the minds and hearts
of her characters, exposing their passions, prejudices, fears and
longings.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, she brings us so close to her characters, we are sometimes
almost embarrassed by how much we get to see. Although hardly a comic
writer like Nora Ephron or Fay Weldon, Gerber--like Philip Roth, Saul
Bellow and some of the great Jewish comedians--extracts wry humor
from embarrassing, awkward and desperate situations, even illness and
death.</TE>
<TE>   In her latest novel, a tough little gem called "Anna in the
Afterlife," Gerber returns to one of her most memorable characters,
Anna Goldman, the forceful, discontented mother of the young heroine
in "An Antique Man," more recently glimpsed in her 80s lying
immobile, resentful and furious in a nursing home in the story
collection "Anna in Chains." Now, after seven years in the chains of
her illness, Anna finally dies. The opening whisks us into the
world-weary mind-set of its heroine: "Once her dying got underway,
Anna could not really complain about how the process moved along."</TE>
<TE>   Anna's consciousness lingers on in its disembodied state, keeping
a sharp eye on the preparations for her burial, while revisiting
significant scenes from her life history. Now, having finally slipped
off its mortal coils, her consciousness is able to correct her
partial and sometimes mistaken memories with an accurate and
objective view of what actually transpired.</TE>
<TE>   Unsparing and unsentimental, Gerber's portrait of Anna is also
moving and funny, not only capturing the essence of her character but
exposing its inner dynamics: "For her, indignation was a natural
reaction. She found it a relief to hold everything against
everyone--it was almost her religion. For reasons she did not
question, her life energy had been powered by fury. She was actually
surprised (now that she was dead) that it hadn't kept her living
forever."</TE>
<TE>   Gerber's lack of pretension, though central to her strength, has
some limitations. There is little sense of literary history in her
writings or of large-scale social and historical movements. Her
attention is focused on the thousand petty details that can loom so
large in daily life; the repetitive patterns and undercurrents of
relationships; the insistent tug of personal memories. Like Bellow,
Gerber has a genius for the irritable, the acrid and the embittered:
The visitor from another planet who doesn't know what it means to
kvetch would need to look no further than Gerber's fiction for superb
illustrations of the phenomenon. Unlike Bellow, she does not venture
far beyond the personal. Her eyes are trained on the quotidian, but
the acuity and intensity of her vision are no less extraordinary.</TE>

<AU>RICHARD SCHICKEL</AU>
<BD>Richard Schickel is the author of "Matinee Idylls" and
reviews movies for Time magazine. His latest documentary, "Woody
Allen: A Life in Film," premieres May 4 on Turner Classic Movies.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Someday, I think, science will prove that "movie love" is
physiological, not psychological, in origin. My guess is that there
is something in the flicker of film, the shimmer and sheen of images
on a screen, that works addictively on some eyeballs and brain pans,
not on others.</LD>
<LD>   Take me, for instance. Even if I didn't have a job reviewing them,
I'd still probably see something like the number I do (about 100 a
year in theaters, compared with the half-dozen most Americans of my
age take in). To be honest, if for some reason I haven't seen a movie
for a week or so, I start getting edgy, scanning the newspaper ads
for something to rest my itchy eyes on: a revival, an obscure indie
or foreign film I've missed, even a teen flick in which some critical
colleague has found dubious distinction.</LD>
<TE>   I don't unconditionally "love" movies--most of them are awful--but
I have sometimes used them as surely as another kind of addict
resorts to his needle: to escape a reality suddenly too harsh to
bear. The sheltering darkness of the theater, the vague communality
of the audience, the lighted window of the screen into which we
voyeuristically peer. Like any addict I usually have the munchies
(which is why the popcorn business is the only reliable economic
aspect of the movies) while watching. When I emerge--unless the movie
has been so blatantly incompetent that it riles me up--I generally
have the noddies; I'm calm and silent and lost in non-thought until,
at some point, my critical engine coughs, sputters and kicks in.</TE>
<TE>   It is that engine, I perhaps egocentrically think, that separates
not just the critic from the fan but useful film comment from swamp
gas. They may be a sedative, but movies are also a phenomenon:
occasionally an art, less occasionally a refracting mirror in which
we catch fleeting, dramatically distorted but instructive glimpses of
ourselves and our world. They are worth thinking about analytically,
in adult terms. Which is why people like Harry Knowles make some of
us crazy.</TE>
<TE>   He is, perhaps, the ultimate movie geek. A young man, barely past
30, he is the proprietor of www.aintitcool.com, a Web site devoted
largely to gossip about forthcoming films. The site became famous
when some of his spies sneaked into test screenings of Joel
Schumacher's "Batman and Robin" and posted disastrous reviews of that
feckless, last-in-the-cycle enterprise. This caused great
consternation at the studio--movies aren't supposed to be reviewed
until the powers-that-be deem them finished--and it also generated a
certain amount of fear and loathing for Knowles in ever-antsy
Hollywood. The mainstream press, naturally, began reprinting his
choicer tidbits. He is now well-known enough for a publisher--that is
another arm of the vast media conglomerate that financed Schumacher's
film--to bring forth his autobiography.</TE>
<TE>   In it, he presents himself as an earnest, even prissy, guy. He
resolutely refuses to traffic in gossip about sex and substance abuse
among the rich and famous. His political sentiments are of an
agreeable populist-liberal sort. He makes a number of not entirely
misplaced but not entirely original criticisms about the way movies
are made and marketed nowadays and about the supine ways the press
covers them.</TE>
<TE>   But I can't think of a single reason to pay this child-man the
slightest heed. He was born into a family of memorabilia collectors,
that weird subset of fans who treasure and trade in movie
detritus--posters, props, costumes--materials that have no intrinsic
value. Their worth is imputed to them largely through the workings of
nostalgia, and they tell us nothing about the texture or experience
of a movie. Rather the opposite; they are icons, encouraging
thoughtless veneration instead of thoughtful engagement with the
objects they represent.</TE>
<TE>   Knowles is more than entitled to use the movies as escapist
vehicles. He suffered real trauma as a child--his account of them is
authentically touching--and had every reason to retreat from reality
into movie mania. Because he has built over the years a collection of
about 5,000 videos, he has ample means to do so. But his taste is for
the most fantastic and abstract genres, the ones with the least
relationship to reality--sci-fi, horror and kung fu epics, comic book
adaptations--and the largest dependency on special effects, which
are, of course, constructs utterly unknown to the real world. A
near-exclusive concentration on such stuff is a sure sign of
emotional arrest. So is Knowles' love of outsider status. Children
are society's ultimate outsiders, desperate for the inside dope
adults refuse to share. Hence his obsession with penetrating their
circle and spiriting away their secrets. But once he's revealed them,
he doesn't know what else to do with them.</TE>
<TE>   We'll not talk "criticism" here because Knowles deplores it. We'll
talk, instead, intelligent and subtle engagement with film, leading
the writer to order instinctive, highly subjective responses into
rational argument, something you can conjure with, which you cannot
do with Knowles' paranoid rants about the system, which exist, he
seems to think, mainly to marginalize his favorite genre artists and
ruin his favorite trashy books in adaptation.</TE>
<TE>   There are, obviously, other ways to take your traumas to the
movies and deal with them. For example, Madelon Sprengnether's. She
also suffered a devastating childhood trauma, her father's death by
drowning when she was 9. She sought the usual escapes from tragedy's
impositions--books, films--and became, eventually, a writer and
professor of English. But as she relates in "Crying at the Movies,"
one day in the 1970s, she found herself weeping at the death of the
young girl in "Pather Panchali." These were not the misty-eyed
snifflings that happen to all of us occasionally at the movies. They
were great, racking, uncontrollable sobs that went on for hours, a
startling outburst of long-suppressed feelings about unexpected
death.</TE>
<TE>   Sprengnether does not ignore the aesthetics of Satyajit Ray's
great film. Nor those of the other movies that worked on her with
similar force. Her readings of an eclectic list of titles--they range
from the mainstream "Shadowlands" (about C.S. Lewis' loss of his
wife) to Andrei Tarkovsky's complex and mysterious science fiction,
"Solaris"--are excellent. But what's most interesting is the way this
moviegoer, dropping more or less casually into this or that film,
finds her emotions surprised, then passionately stirred, by the
"entertainment" on offer. She admits to a complicated, needy sexual
life, much of it conditioned by her search for father substitutes,
and she bravely connects the emotions of that search with those
elicited by these film encounters.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, perhaps, she tells us more than we strictly need to
know about the state of her quivering viscera, but that's a small
matter compared to the alertness and disciplined nuance of her
responses, her aching openness to the full range of unexpected
possibilities a seriously intended film can offer. She is engaging
herself in very specific ways with the very specific effects of
particular works of--no apologies here--art. She surely does not give
a hoot for how their test screenings went. It is enough, for her,
that somehow they exist and have somehow arrived within her gaze. It
is enough for her that these movies do not offer the soothing
reassurances of predictable emotional "beats" carried over from genre
film to genre film but rather are unique objects capable of
bestartling an open, instructible heart. Hers is not the only way to
watch a movie intelligently, but it is one way grown-ups grapple with
them. Do not look for her Web site any time soon.</TE>

<DH>The Tribulations and Satisfactions of Adapting 'The
Commanding Heights' to Television</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YERGIN</AU>
<BD>Daniel Yergin is the co-author with Joseph Stanislaw of
"The Commanding Heights." He received the Pulitzer Prize for "The
Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power." The third part of
"The Commanding Heights" airs this Wednesday on PBS.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am struck by how different the techniques of storytelling in words
and on film are, an experience I recently had adapting "The
Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy" into a PBS
mini-series. In a book, you have a lot of elbow room (even if your
publisher is saying to keep it less than 350 pages): You can range
widely, follow a line of inquiry, paint a word picture and connect,
so long as you remember the point you are trying to make.</LD>
<LD>   Television offers many more tools; most significant are the
images. You have color, you have voices, you can convey emotion much
more directly. And you have music. (When my previous book, "The
Prize," a history of oil and geopolitics, became a successful
eight-part PBS series in 1993, one of its producers remarked that
"Chariots of Fire," which she had helped produce, was hardly the same
film without the music.)</LD>
<TE>   What you don't have is time. An hour of television might have
3,000 words of narration, which is the equivalent of less than 10
pages of a book. So the primary task was to break the book down into
pieces and put them together again as a film narrative. That meant we
had to deconstruct the entire narrative, which had a simultaneous
chronological and geographic framework, and identify a handful of
stories out of several hundred that could be reconnected in a film
narrative. We went far afield in the filming: five continents, 20
countries, 170 interviews.</TE>
<TE>   I wrote "The Commanding Heights" in 1998 with Joseph Stanislaw; in
it we tried to explain why old-fashion state control, along with
communism and socialism, had ceded to free markets. It is an enormous
story that tells how and why the world changed its mind toward market
economies. It takes in changes in America and the upheavals that have
shaken Russia, Latin America, India and other parts of the world. It
is a challenge at the very least to convey to a television audience a
story as complicated and worldwide as this. Here was the history of
the 20th and the first years of the 21st century seen through the
prism of ideological conflict. The turmoil around the world, the
battles and misunderstandings about globalization gave the project an
urgency. These issues touch upon our lives, often in ways that we
don't immediately recognize.</TE>
<TE>   Television has no shortage of channels these days, but it does
have, some would say, a shortage of places where ideas can be
presented and explained in a narrative form. So our first obstacle
was to surmount the wall of skepticism. Many broadcasters couldn't
see how it would work, but finally, WGBH in Boston figured we could
do it.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge was to transform the book so that it would end up
being a big narrative history and not merely a succession of talking
heads. The core production team--Bill Cran, Sue Lean Thompson, Greg
Barker, Mike Sullivan and myself--tackled this a number of ways,
beginning with the structure of the story itself. We knew that it had
to be told in three two-hour segments. The first would be about "the
battle of ideas": how the world changed its mind about governments
and markets. This is primarily an American and British story,
extending from the first age of globalization, which ended in 1914
with World War I, right up to the fall in 1989 of the Berlin Wall.
Our second segment would illuminate "the agony of reform" in Russia,
Poland, Latin America and India.</TE>
<TE>   The last segment would focus on "the new rules of the game": the
struggle over globalization. It was a story that was unfolding as we
proceeded. The "new economy" of dot-coms, Nasdaq and cyber start-ups
came and went while we were working on the show, and we ended up
shelving that early plan to find a 28-year-old dot-com billionaire.
Then came Sept. 11. At that point, we were three-quarters through the
production, which gave us several months to assimilate the changes:
Optimism had been drained out of the future, the world had gone from
openness to vigilance and the passions of anti-globalization
demonstrators around the world had cooled.</TE>
<TE>   But structuring the series was only the beginning of our work.
With the scale of our project, once you start filming, time and
budgets limit your choices. The final segment was the most perplexing
as it was more open-ended, and we were simultaneously updating the
book for a new edition. There was constant debate right up until the
moment the film was locked about what was in and what was out.</TE>
<TE>   I was very conscious of how different it is to interview for
television than for a book. For a book, at least the way I try to do
it, the process is a discursive business and intentionally so. You
want people to feel relaxed enough to bring up the memories they have
forgotten, the ideas they have only half thought through, to make
connections they hadn't thought about before. And you want to draw
out, when it is possible, that flash of emotion.</TE>
<TE>   When I first talked to Larry Summers, treasury secretary in the
last two years of the Clinton administration and now Harvard's
president, one warm afternoon in the outdoor patio of a sandwich shop
on Cape Cod, he causally threw out a wonderful line about how he had
gone from seeing free-market economist Milton Friedman as the "devil
incarnate" to having "ungrudging respect" for the man.</TE>
<TE>   You're far less likely to get that kind of relaxed insight when
the interview subject is sitting in a conference room facing an
interviewer, a camera man, a sound man, a couple of producers and all
the technical paraphernalia, which requires constant readjustment.
When interviewing for television you're looking for "sync"--short
sharp answers that help move the narrative along, also called sound
bites. The questions have to be tight and focused. And you have to
tell the interview subjects not to say "yes" and not to agree (or
disagree) with you (because the interviewer is not in the show) and
you need to remind them to begin sentences with nouns, not pronouns
(because their comments will stand alone). You still, of course, are
looking for the flash of emotion, which might be words but just as
easily could be a sudden change of facial expression.</TE>
<TE>   Of course I have my list of pieces of sync that could not make it
into the television show because they did not quite fit into the
story or sequence. No matter what contortions you go through, there
are no more than 60 minutes in an hour. In the film, the former
central bank president of Bolivia explains the rule by which the
officials reined in spending to eliminate hyperinflation: "You get
one peso, you spend one peso." That became a metaphor for us: You
want to put in a minute of something; then you have to take out a
minute of something else. And the rest is, figuratively, on the
cutting room floor or, fortunately these days, on the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Writing the narrative for the documentary is different from book
writing as well. Writing narration really is like writing captions.
You can go for a certain irony and wit but not much more. Imagine
getting John Maynard Keynes' great economic theory or the causes of
the Asian financial crisis down to just a couple of sentences. But
there's no point in complaining. You have no choice. In addition, we
wanted a warm, friendly narrative voice that would be distinct from
that disembodied, slightly somnolent voice that one hears in so many
documentaries. My colleagues and I worked endlessly over the
narration trying to find that voice. Yet, when all that can be said
is, in fact, said and done, the narrator is a man of few words.</TE>
<TE>   Through all of this, I was continually preoccupied with making the
series accessible and engaging. That meant sticking with the basic
narrative rules--clarity, sharpness, narrative force and
suspense--which, along with the images, make a documentary feel
cinematic and play a critical role in creating the right pacing. It
is an easy mistake to let your story get ahead of your drama. You
need to signal in a general way where you're headed to keep people
from getting lost. But you don't want to give away the destination in
advance.</TE>
<TE>   The basic rule that I always go back to was laid out by the
journalist Ida Tarbell at the beginning of the 20th century. As she
set out to do the expose that would eventually lead to the breakup of
John D. Rockefeller's empire in 1911, she declared that she intended
to do something "as picturesque and dramatic as I can"--although
always governed by the unrelenting imperative of being factually
accurate. I doubt that Tarbell had yet seen a motion picture when she
wrote that note. Yet it is a rule worth following a century later,
whether you're writing a book or working with pictures and making a
film.</TE>

<HD>The 'Lion' in Winter</HD>
<DH>At 79, a former newspaper editor pitches a quirky
story--his own.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLAN M. JALON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than 40 years, the colorful newspapers that Jim Bellows
edited and the iconoclastic writers he nurtured have won most of the
glory. Now, the editor has a new angle.</LD>
<LD>   He's pitching a story about a man who openly admits he can't write
a lick, yet revitalized underdog papers in cities across America and
became the hero of a grand journalism adventure. Supporting parts go
to an array of journalistic-literary stars--Jimmy Breslin, Tom Wolfe,
Ben Bradlee, Otis Chandler and others who worked with him, fought
with him and generally seem to have come away admiring him. He finds
someone to shape this story--his story--into a book. The results are
a new memoir (written with Gerald Gardner and published by Andrews
McMeel) and a documentary to air on public television. Both have a
title--"The Last Editor"--that Gardner modeled on "The Last Lion," as
in William Manchester, as in Winston Churchill.</LD>
<LD>   Churchill helped save Western civilization. Gardner's bratty,
endearing subtitle supplies the boast of Bellows' career: "How I
Saved the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles
Times from Dullness and Complacency."</LD>
<TE>   The self-styled underdog tilted against the dragon of stuffy
journalism from the "second paper" in the most competitive news towns
in the country. The New York Herald Tribune, the Washington Star and
the Los Angeles Herald Examiner fought some of their last, best
rounds under him before succumbing to strikes, richer competitors
and, alas, TV's quick delivery of the news. He took a break from
moribund newspapers to work at the Los Angeles Times, shaping its
features sections from 1967-75.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in the early 1960s, Bellows marshaled vivid feature
writing to arm the "cool" medium of print against the "hot" flash of
television. He then leaped to TV, editing "Entertainment Tonight" to
relate those Hollywood details everyone needs to know. By the 1990s,
he was helping Internet start-ups grab eyeballs.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of making the newspaper a daily magazine didn't start
with Jim Bellows any more than "the new journalism" began with Tom
Wolfe. But Bellows became a godfather to both. At the Herald Tribune
in the early 1960s, he gave Breslin, a sportswriter, a column in
which the main character was New York. Wolfe followed the king of
Morocco on a shopping trip to buy linens for his harem. Bellows ran
it across the top of the Herald Tribune's front page.</TE>
<TE>   "I was using scene-by-scene construction, lots of dialogue, point
of view, status details about how people dressed and talked," Wolfe
recalls. "That drove a lot of editors crazy in those days. Bellows
was open to it."</TE>
<TE>   "'Tell me the details'--that was Bellows," Los Angeles TV reporter
Linda Breakstone shouts into her cell phone, rushing to cover Richard
Riordan the morning after he'd been crushed in the recent Republican
gubernatorial primary. Breakstone, now at KCBS News, was a political
reporter at the Herald Examiner. "Today, I'm doing what Bellows
taught: What did Riordan eat for breakfast? What color were the walls
when he opened his eyes after losing?"</TE>
<TE>   A thin, bent 79-year-old man walks with a contemplative shuffle
toward the Herald Examiner building, at 1111 S. Broadway in downtown
Los Angeles. The exotic 1915 edifice, with vaguely Arabic domes and
Alhambra-style arches that Julia Morgan designed for William Randolph
Hearst, remains in pretty good shape. Bellows--who lives in
Brentwood--edited the Her-Ex from 1978 to 1981, and others took over
until it closed in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   He passes empty loading docks from which trucks once hauled seven
editions and climbs to the second-floor newsroom, where a dusty
stillness hangs over metal desks and computers from the 1980s. Today,
they're props for Hollywood crews that rent the place, superimposing
a make-believe newsroom over the ghost of a real one. "Type faster,"
Bellows urges a phantom reporter at an empty desk. "Give me some good
ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Without stopping to take off his hat, he peers at walls, out
windows. Paul Conrad, a syndicated cartoonist and longtime L.A. Times
contributor, remembers a restless Bellows, always moving "from here
to there, from there to here." The editor reminds some of the strong,
quiet men played by Gary Cooper and Henry Fonda. Conrad compares him
to Groucho Marx.</TE>
<TE>   There is a quirky, rebellious comic in Bellows, a man of props.
Pressed to sit and talk about himself, he whips out a little white
card from his pocket. It says: "This is not a simple life, there are
no easy answers."</TE>
<TE>   Other phrases pop out. What did he tell writers seeking
inspiration? Dreamily, he murmurs: "Spread your wings and do a
thousand things."</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy to reconcile the two sides of his character. He
describes himself as "shy ... quiet" and has long seemed content
exerting subtle influence through the work of others--yet he's newly
eager to make himself known. Asked to explain the contradiction,
Bellows gazes through metal-rimmed glasses and says: "You'll figure
it out."</TE>
<TE>   Silence.</TE>
<TE>   No other advice?</TE>
<TE>   "You'll do fine," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Ex-Bellows staffers say that's the terse way he encouraged them.
In the documentary, many take on slightly drugged look as they recall
the charismatic beam of faith he aimed at them. They say he had the
same faith in himself, a confidence with which he spied stories in
wisps of potential and built crusades with underfunded newsrooms.</TE>
<TE>   An AWOL hippo named Bubbles became a saga that spread from the
Herald Examiner to papers and television around the country. Stories
about the shooting of a black woman named Eulia Mae Love for failing
to pay her gas bill shed light on police brutality and prefigured the
Rodney King episode.</TE>
<TE>   Let other editors manage with crisp, direct orders. Bellows guided
his people with hand signals, nonsense syllabic jabbering in
crumbling, mumbled sentences.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Exactly what kind of column do you want?'--'Bip, bip,
bip,' those were my instructions," proclaims Diana McLellan in the
film. In 1975, Bellows paired McLellan with Louise Lague to write the
Ear, a gossip column in the Washington Star. Mary McGrory, a
political columnist for the Star and then the Washington Post, looks
baffled, re-enacting a gesture Bellows used to show how he wanted her
to write. "And Jim Bellows said do it like this"--she mimes a wavy
boat ride with her hand--"and I don't know what that means."</TE>
<TE>   Ask the right question, though, and Bellows turns on a verbal
fluidity, as if by a switch.</TE>
<TE>   What is editing from an editor's view?</TE>
<TE>   "Editing is an art. You try to put all these parts together to
make a day's news, and every day you get another chance. And you are
taking all these forms, pictures, layout, writing, good writing. And
if you use the room properly, if you are working with people who want
to take part, you can take the gifts of the people in that room and
make them go beyond their normal skills."</TE>
<TE>   Ask a probing question and his speech grows spare: What was his
biggest mistake?</TE>
<TE>   He stares at the ceiling and haltingly says: "I did not vet the
Seberg story enough."</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, The Los Angeles Times ran a gossip item that targeted
actress Jean Seberg. The story, planted by the FBI, did not name
Seberg but made her identity clear as it suggestively described a
"Miss A" who was pregnant by a Black Panther, not her husband. The
item was false and was viewed by her husband and others close to her
as having pushed Seberg toward her 1979 suicide. Bellows--going into
depth he doesn't offer in the film or book--says he approved the
piece without knowing it was a plant. He didn't check it out, he
says, because the information came from another Times editor he
trusted.</TE>
<TE>   Then he asks that the questions stop--"No more on that." Later,
for the first time, he goes into detail about a case that stands as a
cautionary tale of how printed gossip can be used as a weapon. (See
accompanying story.)</TE>
<TE>   In every kind of reporting and writing, those who have worked with
him say, Bellows fostered in others an unusual flair for language
that could animate information. He found this mission when he was a
reporter on a small paper in Georgia, fresh from service as a Navy
pilot during World War II. He read a book of stories by the newspaper
tale-spinner Damon Runyon. Runyon conjured a gritty, glamorous New
York where gangsters mingled with Broadway stars, in stories that
became the musical "Guys and Dolls."</TE>
<TE>   That world of the Lemon Drop Kid and Harry the Horse called to
Bellows, who grew up in Cleveland, the "socially nervous" son of a
salesman father he describes as "somewhat overbearing." His parents
had roots in stiff-backed, Protestant New England. He attended prep
school in Connecticut and Kenyon College in Ohio, studying
philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   He had a grandfather he calls "a quiet man with a way of getting
people to do things without ever saying very much." Bellows admired
that. He also fantasized about the glittering hum of New York.
Bellows says he paid close attention to how the urban fables Runyon
teased out of the city and learned "the whole importance of details
that give the sensation of being there."</TE>
<TE>   He carried that lesson with him as he moved from editing jobs at
the Detroit Free Press and Miami News to the position that put him on
the national journalism map, editorship of the New York Herald
Tribune, which he ran from 1961-67.</TE>
<TE>   There, Bellows hired an Esquire magazine editor named Clay Felker,
who created New York, the paper's groundbreaking Sunday magazine
about the city, which later became New York magazine. Its main
competition was the New York Times Magazine, which Felker recalls
"dealt mainly with the world and the nation. We felt we could outgun
the Times by concentrating all our resources on New York" at a time
when the city was bursting with cultural and political change.</TE>
<TE>   And Bellows was responsible for all this? Felker says that
Bellows, in the way that a top editor decides what happens,
represents his ideal: "His technique was to have people who he agrees
with, and if they are going in the right direction he just leaves
them alone," says Felker, who teaches at the journalism school at UC
Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "He was never afraid to run something that was controversial. He
didn't rule by fear, but by trust and enthusiasm. And believe me, it
wasn't his fault that any of these newspapers folded."</TE>
<TE>   Some media critics worry that an increasing focus on celebrity and
amusement has diverted America's news culture from what people need
to know about the world. Bellows comes from a time when newspapers
were grayer and devoted himself to gossip columns as a lighthearted
way of luring readers.</TE>
<TE>   He tenses with excitement when he recalls how the Ear teased Ben
Bradlee, the editor who became a celebrity for his stewardship of the
Watergate story, for an affair with a reporter, Sally Quinn, whom he
later married. "We had to get them into the pond with us," he says,
of the Post. "That's how we did it. You've got to get that buzz," he
softly chants. "That buzz, buzz, buzz .... "</TE>
<TE>   At a restaurant near the Herald Examiner newsroom, during a wait
for a table, Bellows turns and says: "If you are going to try to go
hard on me, you'll have a problem. Because of that underdog thing, I
always get good press."</TE>
<TE>   He consciously uses his David versus Goliath image to win
goodwill?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, of course," he says. He dates this approach to when he was
called "the maggot" for his small size as a boy. As a freshman in
college, he spurted 7 inches from his oppressive 5 foot 3. By then,
his book says, he'd become determined to "substitute vision for
power."</TE>
<TE>   As Bellows nurses a vodka on the rocks, he doesn't mumble. He
doesn't always mumble, he explains, because mumbling is a strategy,
"part of a philosophy I call 'practiced humility.' It's a method to
use if you want people to help you. You make them feel how you need
them."</TE>
<TE>   The mumble creates "a space that others can fill" with their
ideas.</TE>
<TE>   That was behind McLellan's "Bip, bip, bip?"</TE>
<TE>   "I meant that I wanted hot stuff and I wanted it to move. I did
not want a theoretical discussion with her."</TE>
<TE>   He says a good editor must sometimes cross the permeable border
between striving for truth and striving for effect, whether to get
writers into the groove or beat the competition.</TE>
<TE>   Bellows recounts how, in 1978, he got behind a Herald Examiner
editorial supporting Proposition 13.</TE>
<TE>   Weren't his politics pretty liberal?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, but my politics didn't matter." He supported Howard Jarvis'
anti-tax rebellion "because the monster was against it." The monster
was the Los Angeles Times. "And you couldn't mimic the monster. The
underdog paper must distinguish itself every way it can."</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't that raise a question about his integrity, swinging an
editorial sword against his true opinion?</TE>
<TE>   "I had to get people talking," he says.</TE>

<DH>A journalistic lapse allowed the FBI to smear actress Jean
Seberg.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new book and documentary about maverick editor Jim Bellows show how
he featured celebrity gossip at newspapers he's run since the 1960s
and later on TV. Neither, however, looks at what he calls "a big
mistake" of his career, an episode in which derogatory information
about a famous actress was publicized by the FBI, using a gossip
column in the Los Angeles Times. But in recent interviews, Bellows
for the first time detailed how the episode unfolded. Bellows was the
associate editor for features at the Los Angeles Times between 1967
and 1975, and during those years, he edited the daily gossip column
by Joyce Haber.</LD>
<LD>   On May 19, 1970, the lead item in Haber's column was headlined
"Miss A Rates as Expectant Mother." Its coy language made clear that
"Miss A" was the pregnant actress Jean Seberg, who had won early fame
in the title role of Otto Preminger's "Saint Joan" and went on to
star in Jean-Luc Godard's "Breathless." And, the item said, she
carried the baby of a Black Panther, not of her husband, French
diplomat-novelist Romain Gary. The syndicated column appeared in
about 100 papers around the country.</LD>
<TE>   Seberg, like a number of other cultural figures of the time, had
contributed money to the Panthers and believed the story attacked her
for her political views. The complex, troubled actress took an
overdose of sleeping pills several weeks after the story appeared,
and, on Aug. 23 prematurely delivered a daughter who lived for two
days. At the baby's funeral, a traumatized Seberg--she was 31
then--opened the casket to prove the baby was white, the stories
lies.</TE>
<TE>   The column triggered the actress' downward spiral across a decade,
her husband and others close to her said. For nine years, Seberg
tried to take her life around the baby's birthday. On Sept. 8, 1979,
her body was found naked in the back of a Renault parked on a Paris
side street, the death credited to an overdose of barbiturates.</TE>
<TE>   Six days later, the FBI, responding to Freedom of Information Act
requests, and working to distance itself from Hoover-era practices,
disclosed that it had fed information from a wiretap into Haber's
column. Through that September, The Times published stories about
Seberg's death and the FBI disclosure. None detailed exactly how the
FBI's damaging material had made its way to Haber and into print.</TE>
<TE>   Nor do the new Bellows book, which he wrote with Gerald Gardner,
or the documentary, which was directed and produced by Steven Latham,
a close friend of Bellows' wife, Keven. Over the course of several
recent interviews, Bellows described how he dealt with a story whose
publication has long haunted him.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, Bellows oversaw the section in which Haber's column ran.
In mid-March of that year, a tip passed to Haber by Bill Thomas, who
was the paper's metropolitan editor, sparked the Seberg item.
Speaking separately, the two men--Bellows, 79, and Thomas,
77--searched their memories for details of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The note, which Bellows has kept for nearly 32 years, reads:</TE>
<TE>   "Memo: "Informant sez actress Jean Seberg is four months pregnant
by Ray Hewitt, known as 'Masai,' and identified as present Black
Panther minister of information. Informant adds that she has sed she
plans to have the baby."</TE>
<TE>   Across the top, Thomas wrote: "Joyce--I don't know if you care,
but this comes from a pretty good source." The note bears Thomas'
signature. Thomas, who later became editor of The Times during a
period of growth under former publisher Otis Chandler and guided the
paper to several Pulitzer Prizes, retired in 1989 and lives in the
San Fernando Valley. He said recently that he got the note, typed on
a half piece of copy paper, from a reporter whose identity he said he
can't recall. He said he "probably" put it in Haber's in-box.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas said he remembers a phone call during which the reporter
told him that his source was the FBI. He said he passed the note
along, assuming that someone would verify the information before
using it, which is standard journalistic practice. "It was such a
tiny blip," Thomas said. "And it was Hollywoodland and filmland and
the FBI screwing around ... all I was saying was what the reporter
said," he said. "The way it was told to me by my sources was that the
FBI actually believed she was pregnant by this Black Panther, so they
believed that. I wasn't in the business of killing off informative
tips of any kind, and it was up to others to exercise judgment. I
didn't think about it for more than five minutes."</TE>
<TE>   With the note delivered, one part of a wide-ranging FBI project to
covertly suppress political expression moved forward. Bellows' book
draws from other published sources to describe how J. Edgar Hoover's
Counterintelligence Program, or Cointelpro, aimed dirty tricks at
black liberation, black nationalist and antiwar groups, starting in
1968.</TE>
<TE>   Documents from the spring of 1970, showing communications between
Hoover and agents in Los Angeles, appear in "The COINTELPRO Papers:
Documents From the FBI's Secret Wars Against Dissent in the United
States," by Ward Churchill and Jim Vander Wall (South End Press,
1990).</TE>
<TE>   Hoover oversaw the Seberg smear, ordering agents in Los Angeles to
wait until Seberg's pregnancy grew more visible. He didn't want the
wiretap--which agents apparently misinterpreted--to be suspected.
Ronald Ostrow, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who worked in the
Washington bureau, obtained documents in 1980 showing that FBI
officials in Washington and agents in Los Angeles targeted Seberg for
giving $10,500 to the Panthers. Bellows said he's been disturbed by
his failure to at least try to check out the story with Seberg or
someone close to her.</TE>
<TE>   He said Haber had already written the column when he first saw the
note, as their 11 a.m. deadline approached on May 18. He said
recently that an alarm went off as he read it. " ... According to all
those really 'in' international sources," the item read, "Topic A is
the baby Miss A is expecting.... Papa's said to be a rather prominent
Black Panther."</TE>
<TE>   "I said to Joyce, 'What the hell is that?' I thought it was pretty
strong. Like: 'Wow, where did that come from?' Joyce went to her desk
and came back with the note from Thomas."</TE>
<TE>   Haber's first draft named Seberg. Bellows told her to rewrite the
piece without the name. "I took it out because it made me nervous,"
he said. He worried, he said, about possible libel action if he used
Seberg's name.</TE>
<TE>   Why, if he was so anxious, did he risk printing an unconfirmed tip
aimed so plainly at her reputation?</TE>
<TE>   Bellows answered: "The question is whether it is true. You are
trying to tell the truth. You must have an authority for whether it
is true or not, and I took as my authority the name of Bill Thomas on
that note. Editors have a responsibility for what they have a hand
in. One must look at the note and make up one's own mind."</TE>
<TE>   Said Thomas: "Bellows is the one who made the big error. He was
her editor!"</TE>
<TE>   Haber's column, syndicated to about 100 papers, was soon picked up
by Newsweek, which printed Seberg's name. She reacted with anguish.
Her husband wrote a piece for a French magazine expressing outrage.</TE>
<TE>   Haber, who died in 1983, was asked about the item repeatedly after
Seberg's suicide. "The FBI was not my source," The Times quoted her
as saying in a Sept. 16, 1979, story that reported the FBI's
admission. The story added: "Beyond that, Miss Haber refused to
discuss the story, except to say she would never reveal the source."</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, a theater critic for the Washington Star named David
Richards quit his job to write a Seberg biography. That year, he
received a copy of the unconfirmed tip in the mail with no return
address. He said he had no idea where it came from, though Bellows
said recently that he "may have sent it."</TE>
<TE>   When Richards visited The Times to ask Thomas about the note,
Thomas said he could not recall where it came from and was passing on
one of many tips in the course of a day. Richards said that after his
book, "Played Out," was published in 1981, he was surprised that none
of its many reviews mentioned that Thomas had passed the tip to
Haber.Six years earlier, in 1975, Thomas had fired Haber because of
problems with the accuracy of her work. "Her stuff was perilous," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bellows said he always felt "Joyce took a real beating on the
Seberg thing." Asked why, when Haber was put on the spot after
Seberg's 1979 suicide, he didn't step forward to take some of the
blame, he said: "I didn't do that, and I should have. That's true.
That's why I'm going into all this now."</TE>
<TE>   But Bellows' memoir barely hints at his role as the editor of
Haber's Seberg story. He said a desire "to be nice" prompted him to
leave Thomas out. He said he called Thomas about a year ago and asked
if he could name him and describe his role in the memoir he was
working on. Thomas, he said, asked him not to.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas said that he didn't tell Bellows what to write but that he
rejected Bellows' belief that they shared responsibility for putting
the story into print.</TE>
<TE>   David Lawrence Jr., former executive editor and publisher of the
Detroit Free Press, publisher of the Miami Herald and a past
president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors and the
InterAmerican Press Assn., says there is accountability on both
sides. "It seems to me that if a significant editor sends a reporter
or columnist a note that says: 'This comes from a good source,' that
indicates that the source is someone he trusts and that he thinks has
great credibility," Lawrence says.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a major editor sending the kind of note that was sent
here, and there is at least a potential signal implied that 'I know
this to be true' or 'this is probably true.' And you would hope that
this would be given to someone who was so well-educated in journalism
that this person would say, 'I don't care who this comes from. I have
to check this out." He adds: "I would say that the mistakes of both
these men are equally significant."</TE>
<TE>   The Bellows film, soon to run on various PBS stations, omits the
Seberg saga. Director-producer Latham said he made various "editorial
choices," but not one to spare Bellows. One problem, he said, was
that "there were no living people I could've talked to to make a
Seberg segment work."</TE>
<TE>   But he could have asked David Halberstam, who is in the film and
who wrote about the Los Angeles Times in "The Powers That Be," his
1979 book about media power and politics. He finished his book before
the FBI smear became public but had heard rumors.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about gossip," Halberstam said recently. "This is
really about political reporting of a very dubious kind. The Times
did not set out to destroy her. One powerful institution manipulated
another. The result was the destruction of a fragile human being."</TE>

<HD>Opening the Book on Literature's Future</HD>
<DH>At a symposium, a group based at UCLA discusses its radical
predictions for printed media.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the UCLA campus, in a room devoid of textiles--just cement, wires
and screens--a group of about 150 people discussed the future of
books, literature, words. These people, gathered for a recent
Symposium on Electronic Literature, don't think of books in terms
others do, the printed word, the rustle of a turning page. They speak
of a "new literary movement." They are building "a new kind of
subjectivity." They are trying to recapture, "to salvage the human
inside of technology."</LD>
<LD>   The Electronic Literature Organization has its headquarters on the
UCLA campus, as a joint project of the media arts department and the
English department. The group is not in the business of e-books, a
phenomenon that seems to have come and gone, but of something much
more revolutionary.</LD>
<LD>   These people play with words, images and technology in ways that
involve the viewer/reader much more physically in the act of viewing
and reading. In their world, computers and bodies speak to each
other; they make things together.</LD>
<TE>   A person does not simply tell or read a story; a person is
actively involved in unfolding the story. There is hypertext,
clicking and referencing and deepening a work layer by layer. In some
cases, holographic poems can be thrown like baseballs. The technology
changes every day.</TE>
<TE>   There is less authority regarding what is good and what is bad.
There is no canon, though there is a body of work, some a decade old,
that can be referenced the way the rest of us might compare a work of
art to Shakespeare or De Kooning. These include William Gibson's
"xanadu," a story that disintegrated bit by bit over a six-month
period, and Michael Joyce's "Aftermath," the first electronic
literary book with hypertext links.</TE>
<TE>   There are related classes on campuses around the country. Robert
Coover, author of, most recently, the book "Ghost Town," teaches
classes at Brown University on Web writing and hypertext. There is
even a Review of Electronic Literature. But few of the other
institutions that help the dissemination of literature as we know it,
like a publishing industry and distribution and marketing networks,
are in place. This appears to be a blessing and a curse.</TE>
<TE>   Katherine Hayles, the doyenne of electronic literature and author
of the printed book "How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in
Cybernetics, Literature and Informatics," is a professor of English
and design/media arts at UCLA. She was the first speaker at the
conference, a woman in a pink kimono surrounded by screens and wires.
The topic she raised, which seemed to inflame the audience, is the
question of obsolescence.</TE>
<TE>   "In the interest of building a canon," she said, "we cannot reject
works because the technology with which they were created has become
obsolescent. Instead we should use criteria like elegance of
solution, ideas that turn the constraints of technology into
possibilities." Obsolescence "isn't an issue for Shakespeare," one
man said. "Why should it be for us?"</TE>
<TE>   When these people speak of literature, they mean Borges or Neruda
or Nietzsche. They mean high literature, avant-garde literature,
political literature. The first car, Hayles told the audience--the
horseless carriage, as it was called--resembled its predecessor, the
horse and carriage, more than it did the cars of today. In the same
way, these works resemble, in content, their printed predecessors
more than new media as they are used commercially.</TE>
<TE>   Hayles showed several works on the big screen to her left.
"Database," the project of graduate students Arianne de Souza e Silva
and Fabian Walker, featured a room with a screen and a printer with a
video camera and a keyboard. The viewer blacks out words as he or she
reads, so rather than the traditional, durable text, you have
something transitory, more like speech than print. The project was
inspired by Borges' story "The Immortals," in which troglodytes
incapable of speech turn out to be poets and other historical
figures, like Homer.</TE>
<TE>   In artist-writer Diane Slatterly's project, "Glide," the story is
told of a future culture with no written language, only a visual
one--glyphs made of semicircles. Another, "The Many Voices of Saint
Caterina of Piedmonte," an interactive story by Silvia Rigon and
Alison Walker, tells the story of the life of a medieval holy woman
brought to ecstasy and visions by anorexia and malnutrition. The
story unfolds through the voices of multiple women. Often these women
were made to do penance by writing their autobiographies, thousands
of pages long, and some of these can be accessed by hypertext. In
this project, narrative layering of voices and image and text
uncovers the political truth of their starvation and deprivation.</TE>
<TE>   "Califa" is a project that tells the story of California using
navigational apparatus so that the viewer can overlay maps of stars,
fault lines and Chumash settlements and the changing landscape of
California: freeways over rivers over hilltops.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the pioneers on the cutting edge of this field," Coover
said. He pointed to a long history of intertwined word and image:
illuminated manuscripts, pictographs, Zen calligraphy, the Torah,
W.G. Sebald. In Coover's university classes, titled "The Game of
Fiction" and "C.A.V.E. Writing," students play with text and image,
wearing virtual reality glasses and carrying wands to navigate
through that reality.</TE>
<TE>   Coover and Hayles stressed that hypertext technology, rather than
being exclusive, could be more available on the Web than books ever
have been in public libraries. "Part of our task is to think through
questions of access," Hayles said. "Young people of all classes are
entranced by the Web. There is a great divide: The 18-year-olds I
teach intuitively have a better understanding of strategies than the
older graduate students. The visual vocabulary of video games is, for
better or worse, pervasive. Electronic literature has a dual
parentage: high literature and popular culture. It is a literary
popular culture."</TE>
<TE>   A representative from Finland described the chat rooms in his
country, which often have audiences of hundreds of thousands of
people in a land of just 5 million. He spoke about text-based
television, about the possibilities of having viewers' diaries and
even books on cable.</TE>
<TE>   Between conference speakers there was a shuffle of wires and
buttons and microphones, with an undercurrent of anxiety that things
might not work. Most speakers used notes written in good
old-fashioned composition books and note pads. The lights had to be
off for the screen to be visible. "We don't know how to have it light
and dark at the same time," said Victoria Vesna, a UCLA professor,
"but we're working on it."</TE>
<TE>   An overheard conversation in the hallway addresses whether
"literature" is too loaded a term to apply to this art form. A young
man worries that if so much time is spent on theories and
definitions, electronic literature will become institutionalized just
like all the other arts. Oppressors loom.</TE>
<TE>   But all is not lost.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Epstein, co-founder of the New York Review of Books, former
head of Random House and the author of several books, spoke of the
future of publishing, of ATMs for books, of machines placed, for
example, in the basements of Starbucks that could print out a book,
trim it and bind it minutes after being ordered by a customer on a
computer upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   More works in progress! Fewer deadlines! More money to authors as
publishing costs decrease! He is not afraid. The future looks bright
indeed.</TE>

<LD>"Amazing Grace"</LD>
<LD>   by Mary Hoffman</LD>
<LD>   This story is about a girl named Grace who liked to read and act
out stories. In her class they were doing a play about Peter Pan. Her
friends said she couldn't be Peter Pan because she was black and a
girl. Read the book to find out if she played the part.</LD>

<TE>   "Amelia Bedelia 4 Mayor"</TE>
<TE>   by Herman Parish</TE>
<TE>   This book is about a housekeeper named Amelia Bedelia who was
running for mayor. The part I liked best was when the cat and dog
were chasing each other. Amelia Bedelia catches the dog and the mayor
catches the cat. I also liked it when the mayor apologized to Amelia
Bedelia and when she accepted the apology. Read the book to find out
more.</TE>

<TE>   "Miss Nelson Is Missing!"</TE>
<TE>   by Harry Allard</TE>
<TE>   This book is fun to read, and it also taught a good lesson. The
students were not behaving for their teacher, Miss Nelson, so she
decided to teach the class a lesson. Her class got the most feared
substitute teacher in the world--Miss Viola Swamp! She was a very
strict teacher. The children missed Miss Nelson so much, they even
went looking for her--but to no avail. Then one day she returned.
From then on they paid attention and were not rude during class. Miss
Nelson had her own secret, and so did the children.</TE>

<TE>   Once-ler loved the Truffula Trees because they were fluffy and
soft. He cut one of the trees and knitted a thneed. Then, suddenly
out of the tree stump popped the Lorax. The Lorax said, "I speak for
the trees, for the trees have no tongues." The Lorax was trying to
tell the Once-ler not to cut down all the Truffula Trees. The
Once-ler didn't listen. He cut down all the trees to make more
thneeds.</TE>

<HD>Revolutionary Changes Afoot at George and Martha's Mount
Vernon Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JURA KONCIUS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When visitors to Mount Vernon started asking if the faded, tattered
red toile bed hangings in the Downstairs Bedroom were the originals
from Martha and George Washington's days, curators agreed it was time
for some gentle refurbishment.</LD>
<LD>   So this year, fabrics and carpeting in four rooms at the mansion
are undergoing a $100,000 make-over.</LD>
<LD>   Changing anything at a house as historic as Mount Vernon can take
years of painstaking research and documentation--as well as
fund-raising. The goal of any change is to ensure that the rooms look
even more like they did in 1799, the year George Washington died.</LD>
<TE>   Most textiles in the much-visited Virginia mansion were installed
more than 20 years ago. Over that time, new scholarship has concluded
that stylish homes of Washington's era generally had a bolder,
brighter look than what was being depicted.</TE>
<TE>   "We learn new things with each new generation of scholars, and we
want to make it as historically correct as possible," said Linda
Ayres, Mount Vernon's associate director and director of collections.</TE>
<TE>   Two rooms included in the current project have been completed. The
ivory window treatments and brown leather chair seats in the Small
Dining Room have been replaced by cherry red wool curtains and green
horsehair seats. Handmade red wool tassels trim the new window
hangings. This room was recently painted a much brighter high-gloss
green, so the finished effect is somewhat startling.</TE>
<TE>   In the Downstairs Bedroom, the faded bed hangings have been
replaced with the same red toile, a document pattern that is part of
the Brunschwig &amp; Fils Mount Vernon collection. A sage green carpet
with muted florals has been replaced with a stronger pattern in
documented reds and blues by Family Heirloom Weavers of Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the year, the West Parlor and the upstairs Lafayette
Bedroom will also be sporting a brighter look. "We think of 18th
century America as living in a dull, bland environment," said Carol
Borchert, Mount Vernon's curator, "but in the 21st century we have
scientific methods to help us better understand the brilliant colors
they lived with."</TE>
<TE>   Mount Vernon's attendance plummeted after Sept. 11, although the
mansion did have more than 1 million visitors last year. Though this
spring's student attendance is still down from last year, curators
are hoping the new bolder look will draw more visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "Mount Vernon continues to change and evolve as we learn more,"
Ayres said. "So if people say, 'Oh, I've already been there,' they
should reconsider."</TE>

<LD>Even Michael Jordan knew enough to call it quits. Jordan put himself
on the injured list 10 days ago, cutting short his storied return to
pro basketball before he even made it through his first season back.</LD>
<LD>   He decided that the constant pounding was more than his
39-year-old body could take. So, on the morning after his worst
performance in 13 years of professional ball, he took a look at his
swollen knee and hung up his Air Jordans--at least for now.</LD>
<LD>   My fiance keeps trotting out that story to convince me of the risk
in my plan to return to action in our local park's women's basketball
league this spring.</LD>
<TE>   But I see Jordan's trials from a different perspective. Consider
what one of the game's greatest players has gone through on his way
back from retirement to the hardwood: He had to lose 20 pounds to get
down to his playing weight again. He broke two ribs in a pickup game
that was supposed to help him get in shape. Preseason workouts left
him with tendinitis. The resulting knee surgery forced him through
weeks of therapy. And when he returned to action last month, his knee
was so sore he wasn't able to play unless he pedaled an exercise bike
during timeouts. Still, he plans to return to the court this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I'm no superstar athlete. There's no contract, endorsement or
college scholarship on the line. And our MBL (Moms' Basketball
League)--though it's no place for wimps, with its hazardous play--is
not exactly the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   But I feel you, Mike. At 47, I've got eight years on you, a record
of recurring injuries and a gimpy knee that hurts when I run. The
good news? I've only got 10 pounds to lose before opening game.</TE>
<TE>   Until I was 41, the only time I set foot on a basketball court was
as a high school cheerleader turning cartwheels for the boys. But six
years ago, the coach of my then-8-year-old daughter's team challenged
us moms to take on our girls. The game turned out to be more fun than
we could have imagined, and our Moms' Basketball League was born.</TE>
<TE>   Most of us were in our late 30s or early 40s, and only a handful
had ever played competitive ball. Many of us had come of age before
Title IX created sports opportunities for girls. Still, our league
became so popular, we began attracting 20-something women, including
several former college players.</TE>
<TE>   That turned out to be my undoing. Trying to keep up with the
younger players, I twisted my ankle, pulled a muscle, then blew out
my knee in an athlete's nightmare. (I planted my foot, tried to turn
inside, then heard the "pop" that means a torn ligament.) But I
refused to make that my swan song. Six months later, I was back on
the court, slowed a bit by a knee held in place by $900 worth of
protective gear. I played four games, then broke my finger. Sat out
for two games, then came back and broke the finger again. That was
it. My body was telling me to quit.</TE>
<TE>   So for three years, I've stayed off the court and tried to satisfy
my basketball cravings by yelling advice to my daughters as they
play. Needless to say, that hasn't satisfied any of us. When I
announced to my youngest at her season's end that I need to get more
involved in the game and plan to sign up to coach the next time she
plays, she begged me to reconsider. "If you want to be out there that
bad, you need to play," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And I realized then how much I miss it. Not just the exercise,
camaraderie and occasional thrill of victory, but the adrenaline pump
of competition, the chance to slough off the polite conventions of
day-to-day civility.</TE>
<TE>   On the court, it doesn't matter how much money you make, how clean
your house is, how well your children are doing in school. Basketball
offers a chance to fight back, in the acceptable confines of the gym,
against the petty annoyances--the barking dog, broken dishwasher,
overdue orthodontist's bill--that conspire to weigh down our days.
Sure, I love the physical charge that comes from playing the game,
but it's the emotional release I really need.</TE>
<TE>   My fiance seems to think I'm too old, too ungainly and out of
shape to return to the court this time. It's foolhardy to play a game
as demanding as basketball without months of training and proper
conditioning, he says.</TE>
<TE>   He's right, of course. A woman my age, whose primary exercise has
been going up and down stairs and hauling groceries in from the car,
has no business playing basketball. And I suspect that's part of the
draw.</TE>
<TE>   I don't want to accommodate the changes that have ambushed me in
middle age. I don't intend to surrender to the notion that my body is
abandoning my desires. I don't "feel" 47, whatever that means, and
I'm desperate to prove to myself that I can play like the athlete
I've always imagine myself to be.</TE>
<TE>   So I compromise and agree to work daily training walks into my
evening itinerary. And I try not to find it discouraging that after
only 20 minutes, my feet hurt, my ankle aches and my bad knee is
getting stiff. It doesn't help that my companion is my neighbor,
Bill, who is in his 60s but walks twice as far and spends his
afternoons lifting weights and exercising in his garage.</TE>
<TE>   He understands the reluctant relinquishment of physical prowess to
the ravages of age. In high school he was an athletic hero, lettering
in every sport. Now each evening seems to bring some new ache, and
getting out of bed is sometimes a chore. But he's not giving in, and
neither should I, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Play," he tells me, "but don't sweat the small stuff." Staying in
the game as you get older relies not so much on physical prowess, but
mental attitude, he says: Have fun. Don't fret if someone shows you
up. You don't have to avenge your opponent's every move. It's not all
guts and hustle these days. Slow down, play smart, enjoy the game.</TE>
<TE>   And that strikes me as good advice, about life as well as
basketball. Some things don't mean as much as you get older. And some
things mean more than ever before.</TE>

<LD>From the fresh oysters to the hot-fudge sundaes, last Sunday's wine
tasting and auction to benefit L.A. Shanti was no place for
fainthearted foodies. The 11th annual nosh-athon, featuring the
specialties of 23 restaurants and markets and 52 wine and beverage
purveyors, drew 1,300 guests to the Museum of Flying in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Shanti--which means "inner peace" in Sanskrit--was the first
provider of direct-care services to people with HIV/AIDS in Los
Angeles. Charles Garfield, a clinical psychologist, founded Shanti in
San Francisco in 1974 to train volunteers to help cancer patients.
The program was redirected in 1981 to serve those affected by
HIV/AIDS and established in Los Angeles in 1983.</LD>
<LD>   "We get to the heart of the matter," said L.A. Shanti executive
director Marc Haupert. "Our services touch people in their hearts and
in their souls; and now a whole raft of new programs is making sure
that more people are not affected by HIV."</LD>
<TE>   Proceeds from an auction that included premium wines, a golden
retriever pup and an African safari raised $65,000, bringing the
event's total to $145,000.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Meyerson chaired the event committee, which included
Dominic Middono, Werner Schroeder, Peter Rubissow and Nancy Hathaway.
Among celebs in the crowd: Christopher Lowell, Danny Strong, Amy
Rutberg, Traci Bingham, Jim Turner and Ed Ross.</TE>

<TE>   'April in Paris'</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 guests filled the Beverly Hilton ballroom April 6
for the John Wayne Cancer Institute Auxiliary's annual Odyssey Ball,
"April in Paris," honoring Dr. Armando E. Giuliano, chief of the
institute's surgical oncology department and director of its Joyce
Eisenberg Keefer Breast Center.</TE>
<TE>   Auxiliary president Ina Lewis said the event drew the largest
crowd in its 17-year history and raised $1 million, thanks to the
ticket sales, ad journal, auction and an additional donation from
Keefer, whose initial support established the center in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all because of 'Dr. G,'" said Wayne's daughter-in-law,
Gretchen Wayne, who co-chaired the event's souvenir program.
"Everyone wanted to be part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Giuliano was recognized with the "Duke" award for his
contributions to cancer research and treatment, which include the
development of the sentinel lymph-node mapping technique, now
standard protocol for the detection and treatment of breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   In accepting the award, a weighty crystal sculpture presented by
John Wayne's eldest son Michael, chairman of the institute, Giuliano
said he was "overwhelmed, but if I cry, Michael might take it back.
You can't give a 'Duke' award to someone who cries and can't even
lift it!"</TE>
<TE>   In the ballroom, co-chairwomen Andrea Katz and Sue Bender
re-created a Montmartre sidewalk cafe scene with spring flowers,
kiosks, Moulin Rouge posters and a troupe of rambunctious cancan
dancers from Malibu Ballet.</TE>
<TE>   This event is always a Wayne family affair. In the mix were the
legendary actor's other sons, Patrick and Ethan, one of his
daughters, Marisa, and a passel of Wayne grandchildren, including
Alicia Wayne McFarlane and her husband Jim, who were high bidders on
a tea party with Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Monty Hall
emceed the doings, and durable '50s teen idol Frankie Avalon rocked
the room with a medley of his hits. Attendees included Lorraine and
Don Morton, Nancy O'Connor, Carol and Steven O'Day, Sherry and
Charlie Dargan, Sandy and Irv Cohen, Donna and Harvey Rosen, Jackie
and Howard Banchik, Diane and Danny Feldman, Donna Arnold, Sue and
Larry Hochberg and Sherry and Dan Striepeke.</TE>

<TE>   Hope and Thanks</TE>
<TE>   Geraldine A. Ferraro had never heard of multiple myeloma cancer of
the bone marrow plasma cells when she was diagnosed with the disease
in 1998. And she hadn't experienced physical symptoms, the former
vice-presidential candidate told the sold-out crowd attending the
Circle 1000 brunch Tuesday at the Four Seasons Hotel. The event
raised $460,000 for the Hoag Cancer Center in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "How did I get it?" she wondered. "Was it my environment? Stress?
Some hidden genetic predisposition? There are currently no answers to
those questions," she said. "Hopefully, research will be able to
resolve them in the near future."</TE>
<TE>   Since her diagnosis, Ferraro has undergone thalidomide drug
therapy that has put the disease in remission. "When you have an
incurable disease, you live on extensions and hope, so, thank you,
doctors," she said. "Thank you, Circle 1000, for the dedication you
have in fighting this cancer battle for us."</TE>
<TE>   Since it was founded 15 years ago by cancer survivor Sandy Sewell,
Circle 1000 has raised $4.5 million for the Hoag Cancer Center.
Guests also included Ginny Ueberroth, Hyla Bertea, Susan Bartlett,
Arden Flamson and Sheryl Anderson.</TE>

<TE>   Alzheimer's Care</TE>
<TE>   Cancan girls greeted more than 250 guests at the Alzheimer's Assn.
of Orange County's "April in Paris Extravaganza," which netted about
$75,000 for patient services and research.</TE>
<TE>   Guests attending the gala at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport
Beach on April 6 enjoyed a cocktail reception in a room decorated
with flower carts and replicas of French storefronts. Dinner was
served at tables crowned with miniature golden Eiffel towers.</TE>
<TE>   The highest risk factor for Alzheimer's is age, which means that
unless a cure is found, the number of patients and need for services
will continue to grow as the population ages, Linda Scheck, executive
director of the association, told guests. The association serves
Alzheimer's patients and their families by providing education,
financial assistance and counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Julie David and Donald E. Power co-chaired the gala.</TE>

<TE>   Breathing Easy</TE>
<TE>   Physician Paul A. Selecky of Newport Beach was recognized for his

sponsored by the American Lung Assn. of Orange County. Selecky is
medical director of the Pulmonary Department and Sleep Disorders
Center at Hoag Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach. He is also a
clinical professor of medicine at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds of more than $60,000 from the April 6 event at the Crowne
Plaza Hotel in Garden Grove will be used for the association's
education, research and advocacy programs.</TE>

<LD>"Oh, where, oh where, is my brown bear?"</LD>
<LD>   Jackee looked behind the chair. She found her brother's underwear,
several pair.</LD>
<LD>   But Jackee did not find brown bear.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh, where, oh where, is my brown bear?"</TE>
<TE>   In the toy box were pink socks, lots and lots of building blocks,
a horn to toot, and one red boot!</TE>
<TE>   But Jackee did not find brown bear.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, where, oh where, is my brown bear?"</TE>
<TE>   Jackee looked beneath the bed. She found a picture book instead, a
fishing pole without a hook, a plastic dish all full of gook.</TE>
<TE>   But Jackee did not find brown bear.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, where, oh where, is my brown bear?"</TE>
<TE>   Jackee felt like giving up. And then she spotted little pup.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you doing under there? Why are you beneath the stair?
Puppy, have you seen brown bear?"</TE>
<TE>   Puppy scampered quickly out. In his mouth, there was no doubt, it
was brown bear. Puppy had him 'neath the stair.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been looking everywhere, everywhere for you, brown bear."</TE>
<TE>   Puppy dropped him at her feet. He wagged his tail and looked so
sweet.</TE>
<TE>   Jackee checked bear's eyes, his nose. "Oh, no! Oh, no! Well, I
suppose that puppy loves you, too, brown bear."</TE>
<TE>   Jackee sat down on the stair.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, poor brown bear, you have a tear; a bad, bad spot in your
brown hair. Brown bear, brown bear, you need some care."</TE>
<TE>   So Jackee used some tape, some glue, a pretty ribbon, a sticker
too.</TE>
<TE>   "There, there, brown bear. I fixed your tear. Now please, brown
bear, I had a scare, so do not go off anywhere. Not with Puppy. Don't
you dare."</TE>
<TE>   She hugged him tight with all her might. She kissed his nose. She
kissed his toes.</TE>
<TE>   Did brown bear blink? Did brown bear wink? I know he did. What do
you think?</TE>

<LD>Question: We live in a two-bedroom apartment with our three children.</LD>
<LD>   We have been on a waiting list for a year and a half to get a
three-bedroom apartment.</LD>
<LD>   One might be available soon, but we might not be able to get it.
The apartment is on the seventh floor, the penthouse area, and is a
little more exclusive.</LD>
<TE>   The reason we may not get the apartment is because they don't want
small children up there because they are too loud. Is this legal?</TE>
<TE>   Should we push the issue?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: This is not legal. Aside from the fact that raucous adults
can be noisier than small children, it is illegal to discriminate
against children in this manner under state and federal laws.</TE>
<TE>   While the federal Fair Housing Act does not specifically include
the word "age" in its ban on housing based upon familial status, age
is definitely included in the law. The California Unruh Act
explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of age.</TE>
<TE>   Some housing that is reserved for senior citizens is exempt from
the law, but that is not the case in your building. If it were,
children would not be allowed in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   As for whether you should push the issue, that's a personal
decision you will have to make.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible that the owners of the building are not aware their
policy prohibiting children in the penthouse area is illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Making them aware of this, whether or not you push for your own
occupancy of the unit, should be appreciated by them because it may
save them a lawsuit later.</TE>
<TE>   Noise Is Key to Start Evicting Problem Tenants</TE>
<TE>   Q: I own a duplex in Beverly Hills. My husband, two daughters and
I live in the downstairs unit. Last November we rented the upstairs
to a mother and two teenage daughters. The past few months have been
awful. They are noisy, rude, inconsiderate and unfriendly. They have
a one-year lease that I would like to break. Can you give me some
advice on this matter?</TE>
<TE>   A: If a unit is exempt from rent control and tenants are on a
month-to-month rental agreement, you don't need a reason to evict
them. You may simply serve them with a 30-Day Notice to Quit. Because
your tenants are on a one-year lease, you do need a specific reason
to evict them.</TE>
<TE>   I am not aware of any circumstances under which you can evict
tenants for being rude, inconsiderate or unfriendly. Noisy may be a
different matter. Excessive noise usually is covered (prohibited) in
the lease or rental agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Although you may be able to evict noisy tenants, you cannot
automatically cancel their lease or rental agreement. You must first
give them the opportunity to decrease the decibel level. Serve them
with a Three-Day Perform or Quit Notice (conform with the lease
provision limiting noise or move out). Many attorneys say that it is
best to give tenants two notices and opportunities to comply with
this kind of a notice.</TE>
<TE>   If the noise continues and the tenants don't move out, you can try
to evict them. The courts will then determine how much noise is too
much noise. Interpretations can vary widely so don't expect an
automatic win in court.</TE>
<TE>   As always, avoiding court altogether is usually the best solution
for all parties. If all else fails, try a negotiated move-out before
trying to evict the tenants.</TE>
<TE>   New Owner Wants to Move Into Occupied Unit</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am ready to close escrow on a four-unit apartment house in
Hollywood. It is a rent-controlled property and all four units are
occupied by tenants. I would like to occupy one of the units in the
building. Can you give me information about the process of evicting
one of the tenants?</TE>
<TE>   A: You must first re-register the property in your name within 45
days of the close of escrow. Next, obtain and fill out a Landlord
Declaration form from the Rent Stabilization Department, a division
of the Los Angeles Housing Department. It is with the Rent
Stabilization Department that you register your new ownership of the
property. The agency's phone number is (213) 367-9099, and the
address is 111 N. Hope St., Los Angeles, CA 90012.</TE>
<TE>   You then return the completed form to the agency for processing.
They will notify you, usually within 30 to 60 days, of your ability
to proceed with an eviction.</TE>
<TE>   After you receive the notification, attach a copy of the Landlord
Declaration to the 60-day Notice to Quit that you serve on the
tenant.</TE>
<TE>   Tenants in rent-controlled properties in the city of Los Angeles,
which includes Hollywood, also are entitled to relocation fees under
the city's rent-control law. The fees are either $2,000 or $5,000 per
unit, not per tenant. Tenants who are 62 or older, have minor
dependent children younger than 18 or are handicapped, are entitled
to receive $5,000; others are entitled to $2,000.</TE>

<HD>Special Assessment Is in Limbo Over Privacy Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN GLASSMAN and DONIE VANITZIAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I'm on the board of my condo association in Santa Monica.
There are 43 units, and we have no management company. One of our
homeowners is threatening to sue us. We have incurred unbudgeted
legal and repair expenses because of her, and we believe she was
negligent in not promptly reporting her problems to the board.</LD>
<LD>   The association is now placed in a situation where we have to
specially assess to cover the costs to repair her unit. When we do a
special assessment, we like to give our owners as much information as
possible. Can we reveal her address and unit number to the other
homeowners? Can we reveal her address information at our annual
meeting? Are there privacy laws that prevent us from revealing her
name?</LD>
<LD>   We resent the fact that other homeowners are incurring costs
because of her actions, yet after months of meetings, our attorney
refuses to give us either a yes or a no on identifying the homeowner.</LD>
<TE>   The attorney wants it to be the board's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Since identification and the way the homeowner is
identified may be libelous, any determination regarding the board
disclosing individual homeowner information and the ramifications of
that disclosure in connection with a lawsuit that has not yet been
filed rests with the homeowner association's attorney, the one best
situated to determine the repercussions of such acts.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer's inability to give the advice you need to make an
appropriate decision may mean it is time to find a new attorney, but
a board gains nothing by insulting and embarrassing a homeowner,
regardless of legal advice.</TE>
<TE>   If a lawsuit is filed, and the case is not ordered sealed by the
court, anything contained in the papers may then be disclosed,
including names and addresses.</TE>
<TE>   If the statements the board makes about this homeowner meet the
legal test for libel, your board could be responsible for paying
damages for slander (spoken statements) or libel (written
statements). Being sued for those statements does not contribute
anything of value to the association or to the other homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   The homeowner has no legal duty to report common area problems,
although it is often the first indication that a problem exists. The
board does have a duty, under Civil Code section 1364, part of the
Davis-Stirling Act, to inspect the common area for problems.</TE>
<TE>   That the board chose to seek the advice of its attorney as to who
was responsible for the repairs does not make the legal expense
"unbudgeted." The payment by the board for the repairs indicates the
attorney believed it was a common area problem and probably advised
the association of its responsibility to repair. The board cannot
pass blame to the homeowner for negligence when it is the board's
duty to inspect, repair, replace and maintain.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis-Stirling Act requires the board, at least once every
three years, to conduct "a reasonably competent and diligent visual
inspection of the accessible areas of the major components which the
association is obligated to repair, replace, restore, or maintain as
part of a study of the reserve account requirements of the common
interest development if the current replacement value of the major
components is equal to or greater than one-half of the gross budget
of the association which excludes the association's reserve account
for that period." These are steps the board must take whether or not
a homeowner reports a problem.</TE>
<TE>   If the board did not conduct a diligent inspection or did not
discuss the problems with the homeowner when they were first raised,
the board may be admitting it has violated the law and breached its
duties to all the homeowners, not just this one.</TE>
<TE>   The board's concerns need to be focused on its performance of
duties, degree of care and good faith (Corp. Code sec 7231) in
fulfilling its responsibilities to all homeowners rather than
exacting some form of revenge by revealing an individual's identity
or other information in hopes of embarrassing that person.</TE>
<TE>   Good relations between boards and homeowners begin with
communication. Avoiding a lawsuit is always preferable to being
involved in one, and the costs incurred do nothing to repair or
maintain your complex.</TE>

<HD>Various Sandpaper Grades Meant for Different Tasks</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: What do "grade of abrasive paper" and "raising the grain"
mean?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The "grade" (or grit) of abrasive paper (sandpaper) refers
to the size of the abrasive particles in the sandpaper. Given the
same number of passes and the same amount of pressure, paper with
larger particles sands deeper (and rougher) than paper with smaller
ones.</LD>
<LD>   A lower number indicates that the grade of the paper is used for
rough sanding; a high number indicates the sandpaper is meant for
finish sanding.</LD>
<TE>   Generally speaking, 30-grit and 60-grit papers are used for rough
sanding, 100-grit to 150-grit sandpaper is for medium sanding, and
220-grit sandpaper is used for finish sanding.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this changes with the type of wood and whether the
sanding is done by hand or with a machine. Sanding a soft wood with
rough sandpaper could possibly tear the wood fibers (the grain).
Sanding perpendicular to the wood fibers also could easily tear them.
When the fibers tear, they raise from the surface. Another way of
causing the grain to raise is to over-wet wood.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to determine what grit to use is to test-sand. Keep
in mind that rough grits of sandpaper leave deep scratches, so start
with the finer grits (150 to 220) and slowly work up to the rougher
grades.</TE>
<TE>   Raising the grain is what painters must contend with after the
first coat of paint is applied. At this point, and once the paint or
varnish has dried, the first coat and the raised surface must be
smoothed. The second coat of finish usually will not raise the grain.
This is because the wood is protected from absorbing moisture by the
previous coat.</TE>
<TE>   Remove Peeling Paint With a Pressure Washer</TE>
<TE>   Q: The paint on the outside of my house is peeling. What is the
best way to remove it before I put on a new coat of paint?</TE>
<TE>   A: Paint removal by a do-it-yourselfer is most easily accomplished
with a pressure washer.</TE>
<TE>   Although pressure washers are available for rent, if you are a
homeowner we suggest you seriously consider buying one. The uses
around the house are endless. But you need to be careful. If you
aren't, you could damage the siding below. Pressure-washing takes
patience, attention to the matter at hand and a careful touch.</TE>
<TE>   Once you have finished pressure-washing, you might want to touch
things up with a paint scraper. Also, sand areas where the pressure
washer lifted the wood grain.</TE>
<TE>   Next, use sandpaper to feather in all the edges between the
remaining paint and any bare wood.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, apply a coat of high-quality oil-based primer and then
your finish coat. We suggest high-quality acrylic latex.</TE>
<TE>   Have a Professional Test for Radon Gas</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have cracks in my concrete basement floor from which I
believe radon gas is creeping in. What is the best way to seal those
cracks?</TE>
<TE>   A: Before you do anything about that cracked floor, test for
radon. Better yet, have a professional make the test for you. Another
reason for contacting a professional: You might need to install a
system to exhaust the vapors if radon is present in a dangerous
concentration. The concentration of radon should be checked both
before and after the concrete is sealed.</TE>
<TE>   Sealing the cracks in the floor of your basement might be all that
you need to do. Then again, perhaps more work will be needed. We hope
you will not have to install the exhaust system we mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, use a polyurethane concrete caulk. You are dealing
with simple, old-fashioned gas vapors. There doesn't seem to be much
pressure associated with radon vapors, so most concrete caulks will
do. We have recommended the type that bonds the best and that holds
up the longest.</TE>

<LD>It didn't belong in Diamond Bar. It would have fit in better in
Beverly Hills. Or maybe, with its chateau look, it should have been
built in France.</LD>
<LD>   Passersby weren't shy when it came to voicing these sentiments
about this 53-room, nearly 14,000-square-foot house as it was being
constructed in 1987 on a street with the unpretentious name of Wagon
Train Lane in a Diamond Bar community called the Country.</LD>
<LD>   Even before the house was completed in 1993, however, onlookers
were kinder, according to the homeowner, chairman of a computer
company based in the city of Industry. Today, there are a number of
12,000-square-foot-plus houses in the guard-gated development.</LD>
<TE>   About the home: A home tour drew as many as 1,000 people to this
house in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $4,938,000.</TE>
<TE>   Size: Eight bedroom suites and 14 bathrooms in 13,900 square feet.
The house is on a 40,000-plus-square-foot lot.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The grounds have a tennis court, pool and gazebo, which
has city views, a built-in barbecue and a bathroom with a sauna.</TE>
<TE>   The front entrance has a private driveway, three electric gates
and a courtyard with a fountain.</TE>
<TE>   There is a 37-foot-high ceiling in the main entrance and a marble
staircase that is a replica of one in the movie "Gone With the Wind."</TE>
<TE>   The two-story library and den were built to include some features
seen in the movie "My Fair Lady."</TE>
<TE>   The house has city and mountain views from the balcony off a
3,000-square-foot bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   There are two elevators and a guest room with a separate entry, a
den and a private kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The maid's quarters has a sitting room and kitchen. The laundry
has an ironing room with a view.</TE>
<TE>   The house has a theater with a recreation room, library, office,
wine cellar and gym. The dining room is soundproofed. The home also
has five fireplaces.</TE>
<TE>   Where: Diamond Bar, in the East San Gabriel Valley, near the 57
and 60 freeways.</TE>

<TE>   To submit a candidate for Home of the Week, please send color
interior and exterior photos (copies only, please; we cannot return
the pictures) and a brief description of the house, including what

<LD>Singer-songwriter Seal has put his home on 1.5 acres in a Beverly
Hills-area canyon on the market at $2.3 million.</LD>
<LD>   The British pop artist has long divided his time between London,
Los Angeles and whatever mountain offers the best snowboarding.</LD>
<LD>   The one-story ranch-style property includes a two-bedroom main
house and a two-bedroom guest house.</LD>
<TE>   Built in 1958, the nearly 4,500-square-foot compound with a center
courtyard, also has a step-down living room with high ceilings, a
fireplace and French doors opening to a deck and canyon, mountain and
city views. The high ceilings were among the features that appealed
to the 6-foot-4 Seal when he bought the house in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The estate also has a family room with a skylight and doors that
lead to the courtyard, a dining room that opens to the pool, a
recording studio/screening room, and an office with a fireplace.</TE>
<TE>   The master suite has a fireplace and two bathrooms and closets.</TE>
<TE>   The grounds at the gated home feature an outdoor kitchen and a
spa. An adjacent 1.5-acre lot is also available for $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The multiple Grammy Award winner, 39, is known for his sweeping
ballads and sensual dance tunes. He gained international fame with
such hit songs as "Crazy," from his debut album "Seal," and "Kiss
From a Rose," from the "Batman Forever" (1995) movie soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Cycon and Joe Babajian have the listing at Prudential John
Aaroe, Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Actress Patricia Heaton, who plays wife and mother Debra Barone on
the CBS sitcom "Everybody Loves Raymond," and her husband, British
actor-producer David Hunt, have sold their Hancock Park home for
about its $1.5-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, who have four children, bought a larger home in the
same neighborhood last year. The family also has a home near
Cambridge, England.</TE>
<TE>   The house they sold has four bedrooms in slightly more than 4,000
square feet. The Mediterranean-style home, built in the '20s, also
has a guest house and a pool.</TE>
<TE>   Before co-starring on "Everybody Loves Raymond" starting in 1996,
the Emmy-winning actress, 44, also appeared on the series "Party of
Five" and "thirtysomething." She was a stage actress in New York
before moving to L.A. in the late '80s. She and Hunt were married in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt, 47, also has appeared on "Everybody Loves Raymond," and he
played Tom Halstead in John Grisham's TV series "The Client."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Hutchins of Coldwell Banker, Hancock Park, had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Michael King, vice chairman and co-chief executive of King World
Productions Inc., and his wife, Jenna, have closed escrow on the
purchase of a Pacific Palisades home for about $11 million.</TE>
<TE>   The TV syndication czar and his wife sold their Brentwood home in
February for about its $10.5-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by architect Paul Williams and built for an oil baron in
the 1940s, the house the Kings purchased has five bedrooms and nine
bathrooms in 10,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The home, which has sweeping arches, also has a tennis court, a
guest house, a pool and city views. The walled and gated home is on
more than an acre.</TE>
<TE>   The house that the Kings sold was on less than an acre and had six
bedrooms in 8,000 square feet. It was built in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   King World Productions, founded by Michael King's father in the
early '70s, produces such programs as "Wheel of Fortune," "Jeopardy!"
and "The Oprah Winfrey Show."</TE>
<TE>   Producer Steve Bing, the heir of a New York real estate fortune
who British model-actress Elizabeth Hurley has said is the father of
her newborn son, has purchased a Westside home in the $5-million
range.</TE>
<TE>   Bing, 37, has publicly questioned Hurley's assertion, issuing a
statement that their relationship wasn't "exclusive." Before meeting
Bing, Hurley, 36, was actor Hugh Grant's companion for 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   The house Bing bought is just one of several that he owns in the
L.A. area, real estate sources said. This house has four bedrooms in
about 5,000 square feet. It was built in the '50s.</TE>
<TE>   Bing wrote for the sitcom "Married ... With Children," and he was
executive producer of the movie "Get Carter" (2000).</TE>
<TE>   One of the largest of the Case Study houses, the Saul Bass
Residence in Altadena, has come on the market at $575,000. The house
was built in 1958 for Saul Bass, a movie-title designer and graphic
artist, and his then-wife, Ruth Bass, a biochemist.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by Buff, Straub &amp; Hensman, the three-bedroom, nearly
2,400-square-foot house, which epitomizes the California
indoor-outdoor lifestyle with poolside living, needs restoring but
has been unaltered architecturally.</TE>
<TE>   The house, which in probate, is referred to as Case Study House
No. 20 in the new book "Case Study Houses, the Complete CSH Program
1945-1966" by Elizabeth A.T. Smith, chief curator of the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The Case Study House Program, announced by Arts and Architecture
magazine in 1945, was an attempt to help solve the postwar housing
shortage by providing well-designed, inexpensive housing prototypes.</TE>
<TE>   During the following 21 years, 36 projects were designed and 24
were completed by prominent designers who experimented with new
materials and construction techniques developed during the war.</TE>
<TE>   Crosby Doe of Mossler, Deasy &amp; Doe, Beverly Hills, has the
listing.</TE>

<DH>Couple spent less than $28,000 on kitchen and dining room
additions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY PRICE-ROBINSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lily and Arnie Richards never considered hiring a general contractor
to oversee their kitchen/dining room addition.</LD>
<LD>   "We're kind of conservative financially," Lily said.</LD>
<LD>   "We're cheap," Arnie broke in. "We're too egocentric."</LD>
<TE>   The couple didn't even hire subcontractors, such as drywallers,
framers or electricians, choosing instead to take on every task
themselves, including Arnie's worst nightmare: plumbing.</TE>
<TE>   "I detest plumbing," said Arnie, a director of quality at Mattel
Inc. Indeed, he cursed so furiously over his plumbing duties during
the project last year that Lily, a secretary in the toy company's Hot
Wheels division, threatened to call in a professional.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't," Arnie said. "I won't let this beat me."</TE>
<TE>   This kind of determination enabled the couple to tear out the tiny
kitchen of their 1930 Downey home and replace it with a more spacious
one with granite-tile counters, lavish moldings, new cabinets, new
appliances, a custom-designed range hood and a stained-glass window.</TE>
<TE>   They also added a spacious dining room, accented with an alabaster
chandelier topped with a ceiling medallion. And they did it all for
$27,642 (mostly for materials, tools and tool rentals)--about half
what the couple figured it would have cost for professionals to
complete the job.</TE>
<TE>   Although six months passed from excavation day until final
approval by the city in November, the remodel actually began long
before.</TE>
<TE>   "I have thought and dreamed about this kitchen since before we
bought the house," said Lily, referring to 1994, when she first saw
the kitchen at an open house. "Is this a load-bearing wall?" she
asked Arnie at the time. "Can we take it out?"</TE>
<TE>   Most of the house was already roomy, having been enlarged by
previous owners from a compact, 800-square-foot rectangle to a
1,700-square-foot home with a large master suite and a den, the
latter converted from the original attached garage.</TE>
<TE>   But the kitchen remained minuscule, and so bland that color photos
of the room look as if they had been shot in black-and-white. After
moving in, Lily gathered ideas from scores of magazines, including
Romantic Homes, Renovation, Kitchen and Bath, Traditional Homes and
This Old House, from which she tore out pictures to add to her
kitchen planning notebook.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, after two years of bonuses from their company and a
break from paying their children's college tuition fees, they were
ready to start.</TE>
<TE>   The couple wanted not only to remodel the kitchen but to make it
bigger, and to add an adjacent dining room so their rosewood dining
table and its six chairs could vacate the small space off the kitchen
where they had been squeezed for years.</TE>
<TE>   Arnie was confident he could pull off the project because he had
done several additions before on homes he had in Los Angeles. Those
projects all had concrete slab floors. He considered a slab floor for
this project, but it would have required a step down from the kitchen
into the new dining room, which he wanted to avoid. Eventually the
couple settled on a raised wood foundation to match the rest of the
house.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided if we were going to do it, let's do it right," Arnie
said.</TE>
<TE>   When Arnie took his plans for the project to the city of Downey,
he expected to get a permit on the same day but was told it would
take four to six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "You're kidding," was his reply, and he added, "I wanted to get
started that weekend."</TE>
<TE>   While waiting for the plans to be evaluated, amended and approved,
Arnie decided to start demolition on the concrete patio where the
addition would sit. He and Lily sent invitations to friends for a
demolition party, bought snacks and rented a jackhammer. The event
was such a hit that one friend, Arnie said, "would not relinquish the
jackhammer."</TE>
<TE>   By the time the plans were approved, Arnie had the forms for the
foundation built. He called the city for his first inspection. Except
for needing to tie the new foundation to the house with rebar,
everything looked fine.</TE>
<TE>   To keep track of the project, Arnie made a detailed color-coded
list titled Kitchen Remodeling Activities: red for completed
activities, blue for city inspections and green for activities in
process. Many tasks were broken down into smaller ones, and each was
checked off when done. Said Arnie: "We're neurotic about checks."</TE>
<TE>   Once the floor joists were installed, the floor was insulated and
sheathing added. When the walls started going up, Arnie threw his
rickety wooden ladders into a trash bin and spent a couple of hundred
dollars on two quality replacements. "Things went better after that,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   After a marathon five-day Fourth of July weekend spent working on
the house, the walls and roof sections were starting to take shape.
The couple sat outside on lawn chairs, drinking wine, eating
pistachios and admiring their work. "OK, we're almost there," Lily
said. Still, it would be four more months before final inspection.</TE>
<TE>   While the structure was being finished, with Lily doing all the
drywall installation and taping, decisions had to be made on colors
and surfaces. For help, Lily turned to her daughter, Stephanie
Humady, 27, an aspiring interior designer who studied at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "I picked all the colors," Humady said, then added: "Well, we
consulted. It was a group effort."</TE>
<TE>   While Humady wanted a bold, contemporary look with lots of red,
her mother leaned toward what her daughter termed "a Tuscan look."</TE>
<TE>   Lily, however, doesn't have a name for the style of her kitchen.
"It's just me," she said. "It's what I like."</TE>
<TE>   The wood cabinets came from Home Depot, where a designer helped
with the layout, and Lily chose dark granite tiles for the counters
and light porcelain tiles for the backsplash. She installed them
herself, renting a tile cutter for irregular pieces. Arnie installed
the laminate flooring in just a few evenings. Lily designed the range
hood, and Arnie built it for her.</TE>
<TE>   The final touches were the moldings and paint. The finished walls
are painted in a light mocha shade with chocolate/cinnamon color
sponged over it.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, Lily planned to make stained-glass inserts for some of
the wall cabinets, but as the project wore on, she ran out of energy.
Deciding to put wire mesh inside glass in the doors, she found
exactly what she wanted by asking a toy designer at work, who
referred her to the McMaster-Carr industrial supply catalog.</TE>
<TE>   There were a few glitches along the way. Rerouting the gas meter
from the back of the house to the front turned into a weeklong event,
and, not wanting to crawl under the house, Arnie had to hire someone
else to run the line. One day a driver delivering a dumpster ran into
the side of the house, breaking the plaster. And then there was the
day Arnie, who has an engineering degree from Caltech, miscalculated
and filled a dumpster with 13 tons of concrete and dirt, only to be
told by the dumpster company that it was illegal to drive such a
heavy load over city streets. It took an extra day for him to
transfer 3 tons to another dumpster to stay within the 10-ton limit.</TE>
<TE>   The couple had only a few disagreements, usually over something
that Lily wanted but that Arnie didn't want to install. The medallion
over the dining room light fixture was one such item, as was the
alabaster chandelier. When Arnie resisted, Lily simply replied,
"Fine, I'll buy it myself with my bonus."</TE>
<TE>   "I usually don't budge," Lily said.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the kitchen is done, the couple are thrilled. Arnie calls
it "the finest kitchen on the face of the Earth."</TE>

<HD>Hiljus Is Too Much for Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oakland Athletics' pitching staff is envied by just about every
other major league team because it features three of the best proven
young starters in the game in Mark Mulder, Tim Hudson and Barry Zito.</LD>
<LD>   In a 7-2 victory over the struggling Angels at Edison Field, No. 5
starter Erik Hiljus and the bullpen demonstrated Saturday night that
the A's go much deeper than the ultra-tough trio.</LD>
<LD>   Hiljus gave up a double to Darin Erstad and a home run to Garret
Anderson in the first inning, but otherwise pitched 52/3 strong
innings and sent the Angels to their sixth consecutive loss before
33,554.</LD>
<TE>   Frank Menechino had a three-run double in the second inning, Eric
Chavez hit a two-run home run in the third and Scott Hatteberg hit a
two-run homer in the ninth to power the A's, who have won nine
consecutive games against the Angels and 12 of the last 13 between
the teams.</TE>
<TE>   Angel left-hander Jarrod Washburn (0-2) struggled with his command
again as the Angels dropped to 1-8 at this season Edison Field, their
worst start at home in franchise history. At 3-9, they are off to
their worst start after 12 games since 1961.</TE>
<TE>   "Our pitching staff, with a little bit of support won't have any
prolonged [losing] streaks," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "What
we're getting now is no support. That makes it tough on these guys."</TE>
<TE>   Hiljus (1-1), a fourth-round draft pick by the New York Mets out
of Canyon Country Canyon High in 1991, was making his second start of
the season. He gave up five runs and seven hits in six innings of a
7-1 loss to the Mariners on April 5.</TE>
<TE>   Hiljus, 29, gave up only two hits after the first inning. After
Anderson's homer, Hiljus retired 14 of the next 15 batters he faced.
He walked two and struck out one in an 88-pitch performance.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Venafro pitched two innings, Jim Mecir retired the only
batter he faced and Chad Bradford pitched the final inning for the
A's.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Washburn continued to come up empty in his bid for his
first victory since last Aug. 19 when he pitched eight-plus innings
in a 4-1 victory over the Cleveland Indians at Cleveland. He has not
won at home since last July 24 when he beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays,
9-6.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn had thrown 100 pitches in 51/3 shutout innings last
Monday against the Seattle Mariners, but did not figure in the
decision in the Angels' 5-4 defeat. On Saturday, he gave up five runs
and five hits and threw 95 pitches in 42/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't hit a spot all season so far and my numbers show that,"
said Washburn, who has given up 22 hits, 10 earned runs and six walks
in 15 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn struck out Jeremy Giambi and got Menechino to hit a fly
ball to left to start the game, but then walked Hatteberg and hit
David Justice with a pitch before Chavez hit a fly ball to center
field.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels showed some spark in their first at-bat when Erstad hit
a one-out double and Anderson broke an 0-for-20 slump with a blast
into the seats beyond the right-field wall.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Angels' first homer at Edison Field this season.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, however, could not make the lead stand against an
Oakland team that is showing plenty of pop despite the departure of
Jason Giambi to the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "The momentum was in our favor there for a minute," Washburn said.
"I did my best to kill it and it didn't take long."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn got Miguel Tejada to hit a fly ball to left field to
start the second inning, then gave up a single to Terrence Long and
walked No. 8 hitter Ramon Hernandez before getting Carlos Pena to pop
out to catcher Jorge Fabregas. Washburn walked Jeremy Giambi to load
the bases, and Menechino worked the count to 3-and-2 before lacing a
line drive into the left-field gap for a bases-clearing double.</TE>
<TE>   Justice led off the Oakland third with a single to right and
Chavez deposited a pitch from Washburn over the center-field wall for
his fifth homer and a 5-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels threatened in the sixth inning when Anderson singled
with one out and Scott Spiezio walked one out later.</TE>
<TE>   Venafro, a left-hander, replaced Hiljus and Scioscia countered by
sending Tim Salmon to the plate to pinch-hit for designated hitter
Brad Fullmer, a left-handed batter.</TE>
<TE>   Venafro fell behind in the count, 3-and-1, but got the struggling
Salmon to swing and miss at two breaking pitches to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels threatened mildly again in the eighth when Venafro hit
David Eckstein with a pitch to start the inning. But with fans waving
T-shirts, Venafro struck out Erstad and got Anderson to hit a ground
ball to first.</TE>
<TE>   Mecir came on and got Troy Glaus to hit a hard ground ball to
third base that Chavez gloved before throwing Glaus out at first.</TE>

<HD>Brown Feels Strain in Loss</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Dodger ace reinjures pitching elbow and has to
leave in second inning of Padres' 6-4 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Those thorny questions that haunted the Dodgers this spring--Did they
rush Kevin Brown back from elbow surgery? Did Brown rush himself
back? Could the Dodgers contend without Brown if he suffered a
setback?--came flooding back Saturday night in Qualcomm Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, the ace right-hander who has four years and $60 million
remaining on his contract and who underwent surgery to repair a torn
flexor muscle last Sept. 27, reinjured his elbow in the second inning
of the Dodgers' 6-4 loss to the San Diego Padres and had to come out
of the game.</LD>
<LD>   The initial diagnosis by Dr. Greg Schwab, a San Diego physician,
was either a strained muscle or the release of scar tissue in the
elbow.</LD>
<TE>   After a 2-2 pitch to Tom Lampkin, a high-and-away fastball that
registered 93 mph on the stadium's speed gun, Brown felt what he
described as "a burn" on the inside of his right elbow, the same area
of his surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Brown jumped off the front of the mound--the same mound where
teammate Darren Dreifort blew out his elbow last June 29--and his
pitching arm fell limp.</TE>
<TE>   "It scared me to death," Brown, 37, said. "After going through
what I did last year, I was trying hard not to fear the worst.
Hopefully ... it's just some scar tissue that broke loose. As my arm
comes around, maybe I put too much strain on it."</TE>
<TE>   Brown will be re-examined by Schwab today and is expected to be
examined by Dr. Frank Jobe, Dodger team physician, on Monday. As of
Saturday night, no MRI test had been scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger trainer Stan Johnston felt he could "rule out a tear" with
Saturday night's examination, "but there may be one way in there that
we can't feel," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown hit 96 mph with a first-inning fastball, the hardest he has
thrown this season, and Johnston said that could have caused
adhesions inside the elbow to be released. "We're leaning toward the
scar-tissue [problem] because we didn't find any points [in the
elbow] that were tender," Johnston said. "It doesn't look like
anything real bad."</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans said there was no way of telling
Saturday night how serious the injury is.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say if it's likely he'll go on the disabled list, because
we're not completely done with the diagnosis," Evans said. "We're not
entirely sure the extent of the situation.... But it doesn't appear
to be anything regarding the [elbow] ligament right now."</TE>
<TE>   One thing Evans is convinced of: Neither the Dodgers nor Brown
rushed the pitcher back. "There's no second-guessing whatsoever,"
Evans said. " ... He felt fine with his rehabilitation. We were with
him the whole way, and we felt good about it. I don't want to rush to
any critique of the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Brown suffered a severe sprain of the flexor muscle in Pittsburgh
last July 15, an injury that sidelined him for six weeks. He returned
on Aug. 28 and made five more starts before aggravating the elbow
Sept. 22 against Arizona. Brown had surgery a week later.</TE>
<TE>   After a winter of rehabilitation, Brown suffered one setback in
spring training, experiencing elbow stiffness after his first spring
start. But he refused to let that derail him from starting on opening
day, a game he pitched despite being only six months removed from
surgery and throwing only 142/3 innings in five spring starts.</TE>
<TE>   Brown was rocked in the season opener, giving up seven runs and
nine hits, including two home runs, in a 9-2 loss to San Francisco
April 2, but he bounced back in his second start, throwing seven
shutout innings and allowing four hits in a 6-4 win over Colorado
last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Paul Lo Duca said Brown had his best stuff of the season
Saturday night, but Brown struggled with his control, walking two in
the first inning and another in the second. On his 46th pitch, that
fateful fastball to Lampkin, something gave in the elbow.</TE>
<TE>   "My stomach turned a bit--I had the same feeling I had with
Dreifort last year," Lo Duca said. "He's a teammate, a friend, and
he's one of the best pitchers in the game, a guy who battled back....
He's our No. 1 guy. You have to be optimistic, but it would be a big
blow for us to lose someone like that."</TE>
<TE>   If Brown goes on the disabled list, he would be replaced in the
rotation by left-hander Omar Daal, who threw two innings of hitless
relief Saturday night. The Padres snapped a 4-4 tie in the eighth
inning on Deivi Cruz's two-run double off reliever Paul Quantrill.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers tied the score, 4-4, in the top of the seventh on
Marquis Grissom's two-run double, and they threatened in the ninth,
putting two on with two out. But San Diego closer Trevor Hoffman
struck out Lo Duca on a changeup to preserve the win before 47,893.</TE>

<HD>Trying to Grab the Reins to Kentucky Derby Security</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Officials, law enforcement will try to strike
a balance between safety and keeping the fans comfortable at
Churchill Downs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUNCAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Charles Matasich has been to the Kentucky Derby for the last 35
years, adding to the festival-like flavor with his rose-adorned
cowboy hat and green jacket covered with ornamental pins.</LD>
<LD>   If Matasich and his pins can make it past the metal detectors at
Churchill Downs this year, he will again be among the expected crowd
of 150,000.</LD>
<LD>   But he fears that tightened security in the wake of the Sept. 11
attacks will do nothing more than frustrate fans and take away some
of the fun.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to have a very different feel this year," he said.
"Very, very different."</TE>
<TE>   A force of 1,400 officers from various agencies--double the
manpower for any previous event--will patrol the track on Derby Day.</TE>
<TE>   Concrete barricades will limit the traffic outside it, all buses
and limousines will be swept for explosives, and all vehicles
entering the track will be subject to searches.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone from infield patrons to the owners and trainers to the
celebrities who sip mint juleps on Millionaires' Row will be scanned
with metal-detecting wands upon entering.</TE>
<TE>   Banned items include many things fans have lugged into the infield
for years to add to their makeshift campsites.</TE>
<TE>   Some race regulars are angered to the point of not attending.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be too much of a hassle," said Jennifer Hicks of
Louisville, who's been to the Derby the last 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   Churchill Downs President Alex Waldrop said track and local
law-enforcement officials worked to strike the right balance between
protection and convenience.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized we were in a no-win situation," Waldrop said. "Some
people consider security a high priority. ... Then there's a large
contingent who are used to the Derby atmosphere who are going to be
dismayed if we were to change that environment."</TE>
<TE>   The list of banned items includes bottles of suntan lotion and
water, cans, coolers, grills, thermoses, backpacks, duffel bags,
luggage, trash bags, wagons, strollers, umbrellas and anything that
can be used as a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Food can be brought in only in clear, plastic bags no larger than
18 inches square.</TE>
<TE>   Chairs, blankets and tarps are allowed in, but only at certain
gates. Purses and baby bags are subject to search.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing to not allow me those items aboard an airplane,"
said Peter Nicolos of Hopkinsville. "But picture me in an open area
in the midst of 125,000 or so people. I could hurt an individual or
two with a corkscrew or a can of something, but I could inflict just
as much damage with my fists. I mean, what are they trying to
prevent?</TE>
<TE>   "If they're worried about a terrorist, the guy's not going to put
a bomb in a cooler. He'll probably strap it to his body. So, instead
of checking purses, they better have everybody pull up their shirts
or pull down their pants."</TE>
<TE>   Once infield patrons get through the gates, they'll be able to
purchase most of the banned items--including sunscreen--at two
temporary convenience stores. The stores will not sell alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Waldrop said the track will not raise the prices of other items to
take advantage of the restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   That's not good enough for Dave Grisham of Louisville, who said
the measures will keep him away from the festivities this year.</TE>
<TE>   For the last eight years, Grisham has taken his wife and children
to the Kentucky Oaks, the race for fillies the day before the Derby
that's traditionally attended by local fans and their families.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't go to the infield on either day to watch the
horses run--they go there to have a nice day with friends and their
kids," Grisham said. "Most people don't want to bother purchasing a
cooler. They want to bring their own. They want to bring in whatever
they want, do whatever they want and make a day of it.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of eliminates a lot of that."</TE>
<TE>   Grisham also considered the long lines that are likely. He
foresees thousands of Derby patrons setting up camp outside the track
and spending the day there, like football tailgaters.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure a lot of people will just say, 'It's just not worth
standing in line, paying whatever it is to get in, and then having to
buy everything once you get in. Let's have our own party,'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Waldrop said the potential lines were a chief concern.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing we can do on Derby Day is get people in quickly
and get them in their seats. The worst thing we can do is come up
with a security plan that leaves people standing in line for hours,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying our best, but we're also trying to tell people to
expect delays."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Super Bowl and the Olympics, the Derby did not get the
National Security Special Event designation that city officials asked
for in December.</TE>
<TE>   Milton Dohoney, Louisville's director of public safety, said the
federal Office of Homeland Security told the city of its decision not
to grant the status.</TE>
<TE>   "They said it was a question of resources and that they were
trying to determine the appropriate threshold--if the Derby gets it,
what about the Indianapolis 500, what about NASCAR races, what about
other events?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt we made a strong case. The Derby draws two times the
crowd the Super Bowl does, the Derby has been around a lot longer,
the Derby is an international event. It just didn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   The denial left the track without federal funds to pay for its
measures.</TE>
<TE>   Waldrop said Churchill Downs, which devised its own security plan,
will provide food and pay overtime for the officers at the track that
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "It would've been nice to have the money, but we might've lost
control of the event," Waldrop said.</TE>
<TE>   "Get that federal status, and it becomes a Secret Service-run
event. Security is their only concern, and they could choose to crack
down much, much harder than we feel we are."</TE>
<TE>   Another security consideration was that Churchill Downs sits about
two miles from the Louisville International Airport. On Derby Day,
commercial jets regularly roar over the track while smaller planes
drag advertising banners.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration restricted airspace for a
three-mile radius at most major sporting events and venues after
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The order is still in place, but it does not apply to the Derby
because of the track's proximity to the airport, said FAA spokeswoman
Kathleen Bergen.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, pilots who want to fly over Churchill Downs that
weekend--from news helicopters to blimps--are required to attend a
safety meeting and agree to abide by safety regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The only difference this year is that all aircraft outside of
commercial jets must register with the Office of Homeland Security,
Bergen said.</TE>
<TE>   Security will also be stepped up on the backside, where Derby
horses are stabled.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to 24-hour security, every jockey, trainer, groom and
exercise rider--even those who've worked at the track for years--must
display credentials.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny McPeek, who trains Derby contender Harlan's Holiday, doesn't
mind the extra precautions.</TE>
<TE>   "You certainly want the races to go off without a hitch," McPeek
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Fans might not like it, but you're talking about well over
100,000 people. The track needs to do the things it's doing. It's
very important."</TE>

<KH>NFL DRAFT</KH>
<HD>Second Day Offers Choice Selections</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE GOLDBERG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The crowds at the NFL draft begin to thin out at the end of
Saturday's first round.</LD>
<LD>   By Sunday, the second day, the room is empty: no hooting fans with
face paint and signs; no players posing with new jerseys and beaming
family members; no commissioner dramatically announcing the next
pick.</LD>
<LD>   The only ones there are those who must be there--the low- and
mid-level team officials, a few NFL overseers, and a handful of
reporters to record the obscure college players selected in Rounds
4-7.</LD>
<TE>   But just take a look at some of those who were chosen when the
whole world wasn't watching: Tom Brady, Terrell Davis, Jessie
Armstead, Jamal Anderson and Zach Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   "You can put together a team with those guys," says San Diego
Charger General Manager John Butler, who did just that with the
Buffalo team that went to four consecutive Super Bowls a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the ones who went to the small colleges, the guys who are
supposed to be too small or too slow or too something. But if you
draft well there, you can put together a good team."</TE>
<TE>   Brady, a sixth-round pick in 2000, is the current poster boy for
second-day stars. He took over when Drew Bledsoe was hurt in the
second game and led New England to a Super Bowl victory.</TE>
<TE>   Before that it was Davis, a league most valuable player and Super
Bowl MVP who was taken in the sixth round by Denver in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "Has the size and ability to make it on the next level if he
improves his practice habits and game preparation," Joel Buchsbaum of
Pro Football Weekly, one of the best draft prognosticators, wrote of
Davis before the 1995 draft.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, his practice habits and game preparation are a huge
reason Davis succeeded--one of the four men in NFL history to run
more than 2,000 yards in a season.</TE>
<TE>   Armstead, a four-time Pro Bowler, was taken in the eighth round by
the New York Giants in 1993, the year the draft went from 12 rounds
to eight. Thomas, another Pro Bowl linebacker, went to Miami in the
fifth round in 1996. Anderson, the star of Atlanta's run to the 1999
Super Bowl, was taken in the seventh round in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   What were their drawbacks?</TE>
<TE>   Brady was inexperienced--only a part-time starter his senior
season at Michigan with an arm not up to NFL standards. Davis played
in a passing offense at Georgia. Armstead, a star linebacker on a
powerhouse at Miami, had legs that were too thin--yes, thin legs.
Anderson's time in the 40-yard dash was a little slow.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas was too short at 5-foot-9, even though the 5-9 Sam Mills
had been a star at the same position.</TE>
<TE>   There are a lot more than just that group.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, four current starting quarterbacks have been drafted
on the second day: Mark Brunell of Jacksonville (drafted by Green
Bay); Trent Green of Kansas City (drafted by San Diego); Jim Miller
of Chicago (drafted by Pittsburgh); and Carolina's Chris Weinke.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Johnson, now with Tampa Bay, also was a second-day pick, as
was Gus Frerotte, a solid No. 2 with considerable starting experience
who was taken in the seventh round in 1994 by Washington. In that
same draft, the Redskins used the No. 4 overall pick in the first
round on Heath Shuler, a complete bust.</TE>
<TE>   And two-time MVP Kurt Warner went on the proverbial "third
day"--he wasn't drafted at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a mistake to feel we can't get an impact player in
the third, fourth, fifth round," says Miami Coach Dave Wannstedt, who
traded his first two picks this season to New Orleans for running
back Ricky Williams. "We know that there are a lot of variables
involved in the draft, a lot of different factors involved in making
a decision."</TE>
<TE>   Other second-day picks who have performed at a Pro Bowl-level
include Washington running back Stephen Davis; Troy Brown, one of New
England's stars in its Super Bowl season; defensive end Michael
McCrary, a key player on Baltimore's Super Bowl defense; Denver's
perennial Pro Bowl center, Tom Nalen; Mike Anderson, who ran for
1,000 yards for the Broncos when Davis was hurt; Jermaine Lewis, now
of Houston, one of the NFL's best kick returners; Minnesota center
Matt Birk; and safety Lance Schulters, a sixth-rounder who made the
Pro Bowl with San Francisco in 1999 and agreed to terms Thursday with
Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   There also seem to be teams that usually do well low. Sometimes,
like the New York Giants, they do better than they do in the first
round.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh, Denver and Green Bay have been the best of the past
decade or so, followed by Buffalo, the two New York teams and New
England.</TE>
<TE>   But nearly everyone has found good players on Sunday. Why?</TE>
<TE>   Too many players are rated on workouts--the 40-yard dash and other
things they do off the field. One top prospect this year, Boston
College running back William Green, was described by a scout as
"someone who runs 4.6 in shorts and 4.5 in pads."</TE>
<TE>   Gil Brandt, the longtime personnel director of the Dallas Cowboys
and the NFL's senior draft consultant, remembers Armstead from his
high school days in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the best prospects I ever saw," Brandt said. "When
he came out of Miami, the knock on him is that his lower body was too
frail. I don't know why they look at that. Look at his production."</TE>
<TE>   Brandt also studied the top three prospects at guard this year:
Andre Gurode of Colorado, Toniu Fonoti of Nebraska and Kendall
Simmons of Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   "Barring injuries, all three should play for 10 years or more," he
said. "I'm not sure which one I like better. It all depends on what a
team is looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Those three will go in the first round or early in the second. But
there's always that unheralded prospect who may be better than all of
them--perhaps Qasim Mitchell of North Carolina A&amp;T--just waiting to
be picked on Sunday. When no one is watching.</TE>

<HD>Zidane to Try to Stay on Top of Game</HD>
<DH>Soccer: French star is considered best player in the world,
but humble midfielder sets sights on winning another World Cup title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Rising from the tough streets of Marseille to the summit of world
soccer, Zinedine Zidane is the most accomplished active player in the
world. And he's aiming for the game's biggest prize--another World
Cup title.</LD>
<LD>   Along with Brazil's Ronaldo, the French midfielder is the only
two-time FIFA player of the year. Unlike Ronaldo, he also owns world
and European titles.</LD>
<LD>   And while the Brazilian barely has played in recent years because
of injury, Zidane's form is as good as ever.</LD>
<TE>   Still, this son of Algerian immigrants who became the idol of a
nation by leading France to the World Cup four years ago remains
modest--even if he is soccer's most expensive player.</TE>
<TE>   "I simply enjoy being on the field. I want to have fun," the
soft-spoken star said.</TE>
<TE>   Zidane, 29, certainly has had his share of exhilarating moments.</TE>
<TE>   At 13, he left the tough Castellane district in Marseille for a
youth program at a local club, Cannes. Ten years later, Zidane
reached the final of the UEFA Cup with Bordeaux.</TE>
<TE>   After moving to Juventus, he won the Italian championship two
years running, becoming a star in the soccer-mad country.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Juventus that gave me this standing," Zidane said. "Without
this club, perhaps everything would be different."</TE>
<TE>   But Zidane's greatest achievements were to come in the
international game.</TE>
<TE>   He scored twice against the Czech Republic in his first match for
France and later reached the semifinals of the 1996 European Cup.</TE>
<TE>   His France '98 campaign began on a sour note after he stomped on a
Saudi Arabian player in a first-round game, earning a two-match
suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Instantly recognizable by his big bald patch, the playmaker was
back to face Italy in the quarterfinals, converting a penalty kick in
the shootout.</TE>
<TE>   Few could have predicted what happened next.</TE>
<TE>   In the final against Brazil, the big favorite for the title,
Zidane scored twice in the first half with near-identical headers.
Although Emmanuel Petit netted the third and final goal, the stunning
French victory belonged to Zidane.</TE>
<TE>   When the French team paraded down the Champs-Elysees the next day,
hundreds of thousands of fans chanted "Zizou for president, Zizou for
president," using Zidane's nickname.</TE>
<TE>   Alongside supporters waving the blue, white and red of the French
flag were those raising the Algerian national colors--white, green
and red--in honor of Zidane's North African origins.</TE>
<TE>   The exploits earned Zidane his first FIFA award and European
player of the year honors for 1998.</TE>
<TE>   At the 2000 European Championship, Zidane was again decisive in
the quarterfinals against Spain and the semifinals against Portugal,
and his team went on to beat Italy in the final.</TE>
<TE>   "Zidane is the only French player better than in 1998," Michel
Platini, considered the best soccer player France ever produced, said
at the time. "The others take advantage of Zizou's aura."</TE>
<TE>   Zidane received a second FIFA player of the year award, but Real
Madrid midfielder Luis Figo narrowly beat him for top European player
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The two midfielders set aside their rivalry when Zidane joined
Real Madrid last summer in a record $65-million transfer from
Juventus.</TE>
<TE>   "It is true that he is extremely expensive, but they are paying
this price because Zinedine Zidane is simply the best player in the
world," Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The Frenchman made a slow start in Spain, but his dazzling ball
control and perfectly measured passing soon helped Madrid rise to the
top of the league.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid "is the best team I have ever played for, I have total
freedom on the field," Zidane said. "The most difficult soccer is in
Italy, but the most beautiful is in Spain."</TE>
<TE>   Zidane's elevated status in the sport means he is often called on
to support public causes, such as road safety and racial tolerance.
His Algerian origins make him a unifying force in France, where
antipathy toward the North African minority and its descendants
sometimes runs high.</TE>
<TE>   Zidane's temper sometimes runs hot in matches.</TE>
<TE>   He received a lengthy Champions League suspension for butting a
player in a Juventus game during the 2000-01 season, an act that
probably cost him the European award.</TE>
<TE>   With his game still at a peak, Zidane's biggest concern in South
Korea and Japan is likely to be avoiding injury and disciplinary
sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, Zidane knows there are few who can stand between him
and a second World Cup championship.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to try everything to win in South Korea and Japan," he
said. "It's not done yet, but we have the means."</TE>

<HD>Not Quite Kings of Road</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Winless streak away from Staples reaches six;
L.A.'s hopes for home ice in playoffs are dashed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>First they clinched, then they flinched.</LD>
<LD>   Less than 24 hours after nailing down a playoff berth, the Kings
still had plenty to play for Saturday against the San Jose Sharks.</LD>
<LD>   A victory would have completed a regular-season sweep of the
Pacific Division champions and kept alive the Kings' hopes of
securing home-ice advantage for the first round of the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   But the Kings failed to capitalize on the opportunity, their 3-1
loss in front of 17,496 in the Compaq Center extending their road
winless streak to six games and assuring them no better than a
fifth-place finish in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   With only today's regular-season finale against the Mighty Ducks
at Staples Center remaining to be played, the Kings still can finish
anywhere from fifth to eighth in the West, with fifth a definite
longshot.</TE>
<TE>   They would finish fifth, securing a first-round meeting with the
St. Louis Blues, only if they defeat the Ducks and get help from the
conference's two worst teams, the Columbus Blue Jackets and Nashville
Predators, who would have to win or tie today against the Chicago
Blackhawks and Phoenix Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely, they will play a division champion in the first
round, either the Sharks, Colorado Avalanche or Detroit Red Wings,
the league's best team.</TE>
<TE>   Advancing against any of them will require a better effort than
they gave against the Sharks, who before Saturday were 0-4 against
the Kings and had been outscored, 12-5, while killing only 15 of 21
penalties.</TE>
<TE>   They killed all three Saturday and gave up only a third-period
goal to rookie Jaroslav Bednar, which cut their advantage to 2-1 with
17:11 to play and ended the shutout bid of Evgeni Nabokov, who turned
aside 28 saves.</TE>
<TE>   "Very, very disappointed in the way that a number of our players
approached this game," King Coach Andy Murray said. "They don't
disappoint us very often, but we were disappointed in our effort
today....</TE>
<TE>   "As I reminded our players after the second period, it's such a
privilege to play in this league and along with that privilege comes
responsibility and that responsibility means you play as hard as you
possibly can.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play as hard as we possibly could today."</TE>
<TE>   Winger Ian Laperriere was more succinct: "We didn't show up."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who sprinted into the playoffs with a 13-2-5-2 stretch
run last season, are laboring this season. They are 3-5-2 overall,
0-5-1 on the road, since March 23, when they extended their
season-long winning streak to six games with a 3-0 victory over the
Sharks at Staples Center and moved into a tie for the division lead.</TE>
<TE>   Their last road victory was over the Sharks, 3-2, on March 18.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, they'll take a 10-game home unbeaten streak
into today's game.</TE>
<TE>   They are 8-0-2 at Staples Center since March 2.</TE>
<TE>   And when they flew out of LAX on Wednesday for their final trip of
the season, they still had a chance to overtake the Sharks and win
the division title.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday night, the Sharks gave them an opening, losing to the
Blues, but the Kings failed to take advantage, losing to the
Vancouver Canucks, 5-2, at Vancouver, Canada, also failing to lock
down a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   They were in their hotel rooms in San Jose on Friday night when
the Edmonton Oilers lost to the Calgary Flames, clinching a playoff
berth for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Neither team seemed motivated, the Kings even less so.</TE>
<TE>   Marco Sturm left alone in the slot, and Scott Thornton, on a
rebound, scored second-period goals to give the Sharks a 2-0 lead and
then, after Bednar got the Kings closer, Teemu Selanne scored on a
breakaway with 11:09 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you didn't see great play from either team," King
defenseman Mattias Norstrom said. "It wasn't great hockey. It was
really off pace, but they were stronger than we were, for sure. I
don't know the reason why, but we came out flat."</TE>
<TE>   They stayed that way too.</TE>
<TE>   "We have struggled on the road," defenseman Mathieu Schneider
said. "I think if you look back on our last five or six road games,
we haven't had the jump in our legs that we've had at home."</TE>

<HD>Brazilian Drivers Fill Void</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: Da Matta and Fittipaldi give Newman-Haas
Racing a chance to replace Penske at top of CART series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter how famous an individual gets, there will always be someone
ready to fill the gap.</LD>
<LD>   When A.J. Foyt and Mario Andretti departed the Indy car racing
scene, Al Unser Jr. and Michael Andretti were ready to move in. The
day Richard Petty ran his last Winston Cup race, Jeff Gordon was
driving in his first.</LD>
<LD>   When Roger Penske, the most successful team owner in CART history,
picked up his marbles (drivers Gil de Ferran and Helio Castroneves)
and took them to the Indy Racing League, there should have been no
concern about CART coming up with more-than-adequate replacements.</LD>
<TE>   No matter that De Ferran won the last two championships, or that
Castroneves won the Indianapolis 500 and last year's Toyota Grand
Prix of Long Beach, the premier race of CART.</TE>
<TE>   Meet Cristiano da Matta and Christian Fittipaldi of CART's new
dynasty-in-the-making--Newman-Haas Racing.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, all four are from Brazil, the incubator of American
open-wheel racing champions, and all have homes in the Miami area.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta has won three races in a row and missed starting from the
pole by .003 of a second in today's 28th running of the Long Beach
Grand Prix. Jimmy Vasser, in a Ford Cosworth-Lola owned by Bobby
Rahal, posted the fastest lap of 104.585 mph and when qualifying was
halted with nearly three minutes remaining, Da Matta's chances of
winning his first pole were cut short. He had to settle for 104.580.</TE>
<TE>   Under new qualifying rules, drivers are guaranteed 45 minutes of
running time during a one-hour session, so when Michael Andretti ran
into the tire barriers, 45 minutes had elapsed and qualifying was
over.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a crapshoot with this qualifying setup," Vasser said.
"We got a clear lap and the power hooked up really well. We finally
got our first point."</TE>
<TE>   Qualifying leaders receive one point in the season standings, with
20 going to today's winner.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what to expect," Vasser said. "You can be on a hot
lap and someone comes out of the pits on cold tires and screws up
your lap. So you don't know whether to come out quickly or wait for a
gap in traffic. It isn't easy.</TE>
<TE>   "This team can race to win Sunday. They won the most races last
year in CART and I have a lot of confidence in Team Rahal. It's
definitely an advantage to start on the front row here, but we have
to be fast and consistent both on the track and in the pits."</TE>
<TE>   Rahal's drivers won six races last year, four by Kenny Brack and
two by Max Papis, but both drivers are with other teams this year.</TE>
<TE>   If Da Matta wins today, he will join Unser (1990) and Alex Zanardi
(1998) as the only drivers to win four consecutive races since CART
was organized in 1979. He won the final two races last year, at
Australia and California Speedway, and the season opener this year at
Monterrey, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning four in a row is not our goal," the 5-foot-4, 130-pound
second-generation driver said. "We are just concentrating on winning
the race in general. If we accomplish that, the four in a row takes
care of itself. Maybe if I am leading the race with five laps to go,
I will think about the significance but hopefully not until after I
have finished."</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta's father, Toninho, won 14 karting championships in Brazil
in a career that spanned 30 years from the '60s to the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Newman-Haas Racing was founded three years after CART when actor
and part-time racer Paul Newman and Carl Haas, who had been
competitors in Can-Am racing, decided to merge their resources and
enter Indy car racing. Newman, incidentally, is no token part-owner.
He attends nearly every race and particularly likes Long Beach and
its Monte Carlo atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Success came quickly to the team as Mario Andretti won the series
championship in 1984. Newman-Haas has won twice since, with Michael
Andretti in 1991 and Formula One champion Nigel Mansell in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The team cars will have a different look today. Da Matta's No. 6,
which has carried Havoline's name, will feature the Chevron logo.
Fittipaldi's No. 11, which has been sponsored by Kmart for
Newman-Haas drivers since 1989, is now sponsored by Eli Lilly
following Kmart's filing for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, Newman-Haas had never fielded a team without an
Andretti before last year when Michael jumped to Barry Green's team
with Motorola to have an opportunity to drive in the Indianapolis
500.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta was his replacement, coming from Cal Wells' PPI
Motorsports, where he brought Toyota its first CART victory at
Chicago Motor Speedway in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Today, he--and seven other drivers--will be trying to give the
Toyota engine its first win in the race it has sponsored since its
inception 28 years ago as a Formula One race. Toyota, which is
headquartered in nearby Torrance, has its best chance since it joined
CART as an engine builder in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   It has the second (Da Matta), third (Bruno Junqueira), fourth
(Kenny Brack) and fifth (rookie Townsend Bell) positions on the
20-driver starting grid.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, one of the front-runners was not Fittipaldi, who was
fastest in Mexico and second fastest Friday in the first qualifying
session. On Saturday, he slid to ninth.</TE>
<TE>   "Traffic was bad, the pressure was high and I just screwed up,"
said Fittipaldi, nephew of former Formula One and Indy car champion
Emerson Fittipaldi. "The car was good. We had the potential to start
the race up front. I am really mad that I screwed up."</TE>
<TE>   One thing all three engine suppliers--Honda, Ford Cosworth and
Toyota--agree on is that the new rule designed to eliminate fuel
conservation races will make for a better show today.</TE>
<TE>   "Every driver worth his salt wants to drive as hard as he can, so
it's a relief to know we're not going to have any more of those fuel
economy runs like we had last year," said Vasser.</TE>
<TE>   New rules require that every car make three pit stops and no one
may run more than 29 consecutive laps before stopping. Therefore, no
one can drive cautiously, conserve fuel and finish with one pit stop
less than everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   It almost happened in the 1985 race when Danny Sullivan conserved
his fuel and tried to steal the race from Mario Andretti, but the
plan failed when Sullivan ran out of fuel 120 yards short of the
finish line.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want that to happen again, so we lengthened the race so
it wouldn't happen," said Jim Michaelian, president of the Grand Prix
Assn. of Long Beach and second in command since Chris Pook had the
idea of running a race through the city streets in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   The race has been stretched this year to 90 laps, eight more than
last year.</TE>

<KH>THE 66TH MASTERS</KH>
<HD>Charged Atmosphere / Tiger Makes His Move to Tie for Lead,
and Arnie Makes an Emotional Last Walk</HD>
<DH>Woods (66) and Goosen Share First Place After Palmer's Swan
Song at Augusta</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>He played 26 holes in eight under par. He made up 11 shots on the
second-round leader. He shot a 32 on the back nine Saturday
afternoon. He birdied the last hole he played. He moved from sixth
place to a tie for the lead in the Masters with Retief Goosen with
one round to go today.</LD>
<LD>   So what kind of day did you have, Tiger Woods?</LD>
<LD>   "A long one," he said.</LD>
<TE>   It was a strange Saturday at Augusta National, where Friday's
downpour meant 38 players--including 72-year-old four-time champion
Arnold Palmer, whose Masters career ended with a round of 85--had to
come out early to finish the second round.</TE>
<TE>   Then those who, unlike Palmer, made the cut had to play the third
round, banging golf balls so muddy they looked like chocolate
truffles, and trying to send them spinning in the direction they
hoped.</TE>
<TE>   For Woods, defending his Masters title from last April and trying
to win his third green jacket in six years, it was a challenge. He
said he was playing "mud ball" all day.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to hit some funky shots out there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Funky or not, some of the shots that Woods played on a soggy,
difficult, nerve-sapping day were nothing short of extraordinary ...
like the silky seven-iron that parachuted the ball softly on the 18th
green and stopped it 12 feet from the hole. From there, Woods stroked
in the birdie putt for a six-under 66, working his way into today's
last twosome with Goosen, the soft-spoken South African.</TE>
<TE>   Recent Masters history has shown that the last group is a good
position in which to start the day. The last 11 champions have come
from that twosome.</TE>
<TE>   Here's another consideration: Woods is one of the top closers in
golf. When he has been in the lead or tied for the lead with one
round to go, Woods is 22-2 in PGA Tour events.</TE>
<TE>   This may be something very real for Goosen to worry about, but the
U.S. Open champion has shown himself to be resilient. He is, after
all, the player who three-putted the 72nd hole last year at Southern
Hills, missing a two-footer for par that would have won it, then came
back the next day to beat Mark Brooks and win the Open in an 18-hole
playoff.</TE>
<TE>   What could be more worrisome for Goosen is how he bogeyed the 18th
to close out his round of 69 and fall back into a tie with Woods at
11-under 205. His tee shot strayed into the trees and Goosen failed
to get up and down from the fairway at about 107 yards. Then again,
he sounded more concerned about Woods than trees.</TE>
<TE>   "Tiger, he's going to be the guy to beat," Goosen said. "But I'm
going to play the course the way I've been playing it. I can't hit it
the way Tiger hits it. I'm going to be 30 yards behind him tomorrow.
I'm just going to have to really try and get it in there close and
try to put pressure on him."</TE>
<TE>   Should either Woods or Goosen falter, a cast of all-stars waits to
swoop in and win it. Closest to the leaders is Vijay Singh, who led
after two rounds but bogeyed two of the last four holes to finish
with a 72, leaving him two shots behind Woods and Goosen.</TE>
<TE>   Singh hit his five-iron second shot into the water on the 15th,
where he said he was victimized by mud.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of mud," Singh said. "You try to play to the fat side of
the greens and hope it goes straight, but you make the best swing you
can and you look up and the ball is going sideways. Those are the
things you have no control over."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Mickelson, who had a bogey-free round of 68, and Sergio
Garcia, who shot a two-under 70, are four shots back at 209. They are
joined there by Ernie Els. Despite a bogey at the last hole after his
drive clipped a tree, Els posted a 72 and remained in contention.</TE>
<TE>   The only other player who might be close enough is Jose Maria
Olazabal. The two-time Masters champion eagled the 13th hole on his
way to a one-under 71 that put him five shots behind Woods and
Goosen.</TE>
<TE>   Goosen has a shot at making Masters history. With rounds of 69, 67
and 69, he could become the only player to have four rounds in the
60s. The Masters is the only major that has not had a player shoot
four rounds in the 60s.</TE>
<TE>   Only four players scored in the 60s Saturday--Brad Faxon, at 69,
joined Woods, Goosen and Mickelson--a circumstance ascribed to the
difficult conditions that eliminated any fairway roll, in addition to
the tribulations from the much tougher course set-up. If the greens
hadn't been softened by the rain, Woods said the scores wouldn't even
be close to what they were.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been a completely different story," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson said he can win the tournament, even though he is four
shots off the lead, but only if he manages a 66 or 65.</TE>
<TE>   "That's kind of the goal," he said. "I think the golf course is
very susceptible to birdies with the greens being soft and receiving
shots well. It's certainly not playing easy because it's playing so
long, but there are a lot of holes that can be birdied. If I play a
good round, I think [winning] is do-able."</TE>
<TE>   Like Mickelson, Garcia also didn't have a bogey. But he also had
only two birdies and he knows he has a lot of ground to make up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always harder when [Woods is] up there four strokes in front
of you, there's no doubt," Garcia said. "But it's not impossible. If
he was eight shots in front, then I'll say that's tough.</TE>
<TE>   "I've come from worse places than this and in worse positions to
win. But, you know, they are good players, but they are humans, too.
If you put some pressure on them, they are going to have a hard
time."</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who began the day six shots behind Singh, said whatever
momentum he had in the afternoon was made possible by the way he
closed out the eight holes he had to play in the morning to finish
the delayed second round. At the 11th, he made a 10-footer for par.
He birdied the par-five 13th and the par-five 15th, then ended his
round with three consecutive par saves. He made a three-foot putt at
the 16th, a 10-footer at the 17th and a four-footer at the 18th.</TE>
<TE>   "I've made my share of [birdie] putts, but I think I've also made
my share of par putts," Woods said. "These are things that you have
to do in order to keep the momentum in the round going. I seem to
have been successful at it so far."</TE>
<TE>   It would seem so. After making three bogeys in a first-round 70,
Woods has played the last 36 holes with one bogey and 10 birdies.</TE>
<TE>   And so he's in the last group at the Masters for the third time;
he won from the same position in 1997 and 2001. This means he is not
exactly intimidated by the prospect of having a chance to do it again
when he plays in the last group.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been there before and I look forward to it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He's not the only one.</TE>

<HD>Another Chance to Ride Along With Tiger? Amen to That</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>You are writing about anyone but him.</LD>
<LD>   You are sitting amid the birds and flowers and stinking mud at
Amen Corner, and you are waiting for the story, and you don't know
what it is, but you know what it isn't.</LD>
<LD>   It is not the guy whose name appeared in 654 stories in this
newspaper last year.</LD>
<TE>   It is not the guy who has swallowed up the rest of golf and is
bloated from the publicity and is making us queasy from the overkill
and ...</TE>
<TE>   Then a little white hand sticks through a hole in the wooden
leaderboard.</TE>
<TE>   That little hand places a giant red number next to the guy's name.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd gasps, hundreds swallowing the Southern humidity at
precisely the same time, the whoosh of a giant vacuum cleaner.</TE>
<TE>   And you are sucked in again.</TE>
<TE>   It's Tiger Woods, one hole back, making his fourth birdie.</TE>
<TE>   It's the human ninth-inning rally, the living fourth-quarter
comeback, our greatest sportsman doing his favorite dance on his
sport's biggest stage.</TE>
<TE>   It's Tiger Woods, making another charge at the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   It's a fool who will not jump on for the ride.</TE>
<TE>   So you do, picking him up at the 11th hole Saturday, sloshing
through the sludge, bouncing off the crowds, hanging with Swedish
girlfriends and doting moms and history.</TE>
<TE>   The roll lasts all afternoon, but only 66 strokes long, taking
Woods past six other golfers and into a tie for the lead entering
today's final round.</TE>
<TE>   (The tie is with a guy named Retief Goosen, who is now officially
cooked.)</TE>
<TE>   The roll is about scrunched shirt sleeves and folded cap bills and
by the time it gets to the 18th green, it's about redemption.</TE>
<TE>   As Woods stands in the middle of the fairway preparing his
approach shot, it begins raining. Hard. You want to leave. It's late
in the day. If you hurry, you can watch the last shot on television.</TE>
<TE>   But fans sitting and standing 10-deep around the green, they open
umbrellas and unfold ponchos and stay. They know. You stick your
notebook under your shirt and stay with them.</TE>
<TE>   As Woods hits an approach shot that carries some 30 feet past the
hole, everyone is murmuring, "Too long, too long ..."</TE>
<TE>   Then the ball hits the green and, despite the wetness, despite the
odds, the ball inexplicably spins back 20 feet toward the cup.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd is gasping again, then wildly cheering, then closing
their umbrellas.</TE>
<TE>   Because by the time Woods reaches the green, the rain has stopped.</TE>
<TE>   And by the time he follows the birdie putt into the hole and
points at it like a child who has just followed his
instructions--where have we seen that before?--the tournament is
essentially over.</TE>
<TE>   "I rolled the rock pretty good today," he said with a grin.</TE>
<TE>   Rock and roll is right.</TE>
<TE>   Following Woods, a tired exercise often avoided by the media until
absolutely necessary these days, remains the most wonderfully bloody
American thing about golf.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is one of only two U.S.-born players on the Masters'
10-person leaderboard, but he makes more noise than the rest of the
board combined.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the all-white crowds, his diverse entourage stands out like
fresh lettuce in this land of the deep fry. Following him Saturday
were an Asian-American mom (Tilda), a Swedish girlfriend (Elin
Nordegren) and several African-American friends.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the oh-so-polite atmosphere here, his crowds are also not
afraid to shout. Woods still gets all the whoops, most of the
screams--"Tiger! Tiger!"--and standing ovations that start 40 yards
before anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   He is also increasingly unafraid to be himself. Despite fighting
out of traps and fringes for most of the back nine Saturday, he
laughed and joked and even took time to eat a banana while walking
down the middle of the 14th fairway.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, you go through a learning curve," he said, later
adding, "You learn how to handle yourself and handle certain
situations a little bit better, through either failures or
successes."</TE>
<TE>   All this, despite waking up at 4:30 a.m. and playing 26 holes
because of Friday's rain delay.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, if you can get in the final group, you know at least
you've done your job that day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The final group? Most golfers cringe at the hot lights of the
final group. Most would rather sneak to a championship.</TE>
<TE>   You imagine, too, that Kobe Bryant would like the final group. Joe
Montana would have loved the final group.</TE>
<TE>   Then you realize, watching Woods in the final round is like
watching Bryant in the fourth quarter, or Montana in the final
minutes, watching greatness earn its beauty by blooming under
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   In major tournaments in which he has led or tied for the lead
going into the final day, Woods is six for six.</TE>
<TE>   In all PGA Tour events in this situation, he is 22-2.</TE>
<TE>   The statistics are numbing. The noise is deafening. The ride is a
blast.</TE>
<TE>   And so millions more will climb aboard today, hands in the air,
Tiger Woods in the house, rock and roll.</TE>

<HD>Student Travel Shop Pays $30,000 in Consumer Claims</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Owners of the defunct Class Travel International Inc., which operated
trips for high school and college students, have agreed to pay
$30,000 in consumer restitution and legal costs in a settlement with
the California attorney general's office.</LD>
<LD>   In a lawsuit filed last year, the attorney general accused the
Redondo Beach-based tour operator of defrauding consumers. Customers
said airline tickets were not delivered, prepaid food packages were
not honored and they were forced to sleep in lobbies or crowded rooms
because lodging was not available, among other complaints cited by
the attorney general's office.</LD>
<LD>   "We vigorously denied the allegations" in the lawsuit, Geoffrey
Gold, Los Angeles-based attorney for Class Travel, said last week. He
acknowledged that the tour operator, which had said it served more
than 30,000 students a year, "had some problems," but he said it also
had "many happy and satisfied" customers. He added that the company
settled the case because it "couldn't afford to fight it."</LD>
<TE>   Separately, the California Travel Consumer Restitution Corp., or
TCRC, has paid nearly $5,000 in claims against Class Travel, and more
were pending last week, said Patricia Campbell, the president of
TCRC. The quasi-public agency reimburses consumers when a
California-based travel seller fails to deliver paid-for services.
Gold said part of the settlement with the attorney general was
earmarked to reimburse the TCRC.</TE>

<LD>Americans who need to get a passport from a U.S. Embassy or consulate
in a foreign country must allow extra time, the State Department
advised. That's because the passports, incorporating new security
features such as digitized images, are being issued only at the
National Passport Processing Center in Portsmouth, N.H., rather than

<HD>Floating a New Idea: The Art of Jellyfish</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is it an art show, an aquarium display or a flashback to the '60s?</LD>
<LD>   The new exhibit at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, called "Jellies:
Living Art," is a little bit of all those things. Flowing over 4,650
feet in five galleries, it presents hundreds of live jellyfish along
with works of art, film and music inspired by them. Glass sculptor
Dale Chihuly and painter David Hockney are among more than a dozen
artists who contributed. Video montages call up imagery from
Michelangelo, Dali and rave dances.</LD>
<LD>   One gallery has "kind of a '60s feel with lava lamps and rock
music," said spokesman Ken Peterson. In another area, visitors walk
through a mirrored tunnel past more than 500 moon jellies. The show
is more than twice as large as the aquarium's "Drifters," a permanent
exhibit since 1996, and features worldwide species rather than just
indigenous ones. But the main difference is that "the integration of
art is beyond what anyone has done," Peterson said.</LD>
<TE>   "Jellies: Living Art" will run through Jan. 4, 2005. It is
included with aquarium admission of $17.95 for adults and $7.95 for
children 3 to 12. Advance tickets are recommended for summer and
holidays. (800) 756-3737, www.montereybayaquarium.org.</TE>

<HD>2 Airlines Expand Hawaii Service From West Coast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hawaiian and Aloha airlines are expanding service from Southern
California to Hawaii after the collapse last month of their proposed
merger.</LD>
<LD>   Hawaiian on June 7 will begin daily nonstop service to Honolulu
from Ontario and (and also Sacramento) using 767-300 ER aircraft that
can carry 252 passengers. In February it announced plans to resume
daily nonstop LAX-Maui flights on June 15 (flights were suspended
after Sept. 11) and add a fourth daily flight between LAX and
Honolulu for the summer.</LD>
<LD>   Aloha on June 1 will begin daily nonstop service between Burbank
and Honolulu using new 737-700 aircraft with 124 seats. It already
flies to Honolulu and Maui from Orange County's John Wayne Airport.
Although known mainly for inter-island service, the carrier has been
flying long-haul transpacific routes since February 2000.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new charter train that was scheduled to make four round-trip runs
this spring between Los Angeles' Union Station and Las Vegas will
make only one run, on May 7, the operator said last week. Henry Luna,
president of Key Holidays in Walnut Creek, Calif., said not enough
people had signed up to make the other trips possible.</LD>
<LD>   As of last week, about 340 people had booked the 660-passenger
train for May 7, he said. Packages start at $195 per person, double

<HD>On Catalina, a Charming Home Base</HD>
<DH>Renting a house instead of a hotel room lets parents enjoy
the island's simple pleasures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AVALON</DL>
<LD>I searched for the perfect, family-friendly rental house on Santa
Catalina Island, scrutinizing one grainy Internet photo after
another. I clicked past homes with high balconies and railings. Also
those that specified "No children."</LD>
<LD>   I eventually settled on a light green, bougainvillea-draped
cottage a few blocks from the beach. It advertised two bedrooms, two
bathrooms and a washer and dryer. The woman at the rental agency said
it was one of her favorites, so I booked it.</LD>
<LD>   For our first vacation as a family of four, renting a house
instead of a hotel room seemed the way to go. With a kitchen right
there, our 2-year-old, Nick, could get his favorite dinner of frozen
waffles. We would have a washing machine for all those spit-up rags
from our 4-month-old, John. And if either child had any meltdowns, my
husband, Martin, and I wouldn't make enemies at a bed-and-breakfast.</LD>
<TE>   Catalina seemed an ideal choice too. Just an hourlong boat ride
from Long Beach, it is conveniently close yet far enough away to feel
like vacation.</TE>
<TE>   I called ahead and reserved tickets on a Catalina Express boat
that departed near the Queen Mary. Round-trip tickets are $40 for
adults, $30.50 for children 2 and older, and $3 for babies (to cover
an Avalon city tax). In summer, the company advises people to book
weeks in advance.</TE>
<TE>   When we pulled into the parking lot one Friday morning last month,
our main worry was seasickness. As it turned out, it should have been
just getting on board.</TE>
<TE>   Over the phone, the company had warned us that our stroller would
have to be "checked" under the boat. I erroneously assumed that meant
we would check luggage, like on an airplane. Not so.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to wait on the dock and then carry everything onto the
boat ourselves," Martin said after returning from the Catalina
Express office lugging a stroller, a playpen and the world's largest
duffel bag, stuffed full of clothes for four people, diapers for two
kids and videos of the Wiggles, Australian children's entertainers.</TE>
<TE>   There is no assigned seating, so we stood in line for half an hour
in the hot sun with the luggage, a 30-pound toddler and a 17-pound
baby in a car seat. We boarded with the kids to get seats; then
Martin made a second trip for our belongings.</TE>
<TE>   At least the crew members, unlike their land-based co-workers,
were pleasant and helpful. The seats were comfortable and afforded
terrific views. The sea was calm, and the drone of the engine sent
little John off to sleep. Nick, fascinated with sharks, kept an eye
out for predators in the water.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing Catalina appear on the horizon was like magic. The
sun-splashed hills and beaches of Avalon beckoned.</TE>
<TE>   But then another snag. The spot where Catalina Express lets off
passengers is a five- or 10-minute walk from the heart of Avalon.
With kids and luggage, we needed a taxi. So did a lot of other
people, all competing for three cabs.</TE>
<TE>   Since I used to live in New York (OK, just nine months), I flagged
down a driver who said he would take us to our rental. When Martin
hurried to get our belongings from the boat, another passenger (a
fellow ex-New Yorker, no doubt) took the cab.</TE>
<TE>   Martin came back with the luggage and said, "Where's the cab?"</TE>
<TE>   Nick took one look around and announced, "I want to go home now!"</TE>
<TE>   Then the baby woke up hungry and started crying.</TE>
<TE>   Another cab finally came--and charged us $11 for a half-mile trip.
That's life on the big island.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky for us, the house was worth all the trouble. It was on a
quiet residential street a few blocks from Avalon's crescent-shaped
harbor, as promised.</TE>
<TE>   Our agency, Catalina Island Vacation Rentals, is one of the
largest on Catalina. Two-bedroom houses in Avalon range from $150 to
$200 per night, and three-bedrooms run $200 to $500 plus tax, with
cleaning and processing fees averaging $90 per stay. Condos in
adjacent Hamilton Cove, priced a bit higher, have stunning views, and
guests have access to a golf cart, pool, tennis courts, fitness
center and a private beach.</TE>
<TE>   We were immediately charmed by our cottage's homey, old-fashioned
furnishings. Though we didn't see the washer and dryer (the rental
office later explained it was outside) and neither bathroom had a tub
for bathing our toddler, we liked the cute kitchen and the living
room with piano. The nightly rate: $150 plus tax and about $70 in
additional fees.</TE>
<TE>   We made ourselves at home, then headed to the Catalina Cantina for
your standard enchilada combo plates.</TE>
<TE>   Avalon is darling. We walked up and down the main waterfront
strip, Crescent Avenue (called Front Street by locals), gazing out at
the Pacific and stopping at an ice cream shop and stores selling
T-shirts and other souvenirs.</TE>
<TE>   Several places stocked brightly colored replicas of Catalina tile,
made by Catalina Clay Products from the island's soil during the late
1920s and 1930s. The tiles, featuring birds and geometric patterns,
are put to beautiful use throughout the village, especially at a
town-square fountain.</TE>
<TE>   Although Catalina offers a bounty of outdoor activities, we've
found that a simple walk turns into an adventure through Nick's
need-to-know-now eyes. Martin and I fielded a range of questions,
from what's the name of a crane being used in pier construction to
why the chocolate chip ice cream here tastes different.</TE>
<TE>   The baby fell asleep in his stroller amid the cacophony of the
Penny Arcade. While Nick and Martin (mostly Martin) played Space
Invaders, I strolled John outside and enjoyed the sunshine. Later we
all walked on the beach, watched boats in the harbor and buried rocks
in the sand.</TE>
<TE>   At the Discovery Tours office in town, a woman passed out a
brochure on local marine life, and Nick was particularly interested
in a big, orange garibaldi fish. All sorts of tours are available,
including night cruises to see Catalina's flying fish, glass-bottomed
boat rides and trips in a semi-submersible vessel.</TE>
<TE>   We asked which tour was best for kids. She suggested the
semi-submersible because Nick could sit face to face with fish. It
was a little pricey--$30 for adults, $15 for kids for a 45-minute
ride--but we decided to try it on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   For dinner, we bought groceries, fixed spaghetti and relaxed at
"home," playing the piano, watching a video and falling asleep by 10.</TE>
<TE>   At 6:30 a.m. we were all up again, setting off a bit later for
kid-friendly Pancake Cottage in Avalon, open for more than 40 years.
The place was packed with locals and tourists. Service was quick and
friendly, and the pancakes, eggs and bacon were a nice way to start
our day.</TE>
<TE>   Martin watched the boys at a cute playground near the water while
I went shopping. Then, back at the house, a minor miracle: The boys
napped at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   I slipped out to buy the semi-submersible tickets but was too
late. All the afternoon rides were sold out. Of course, the kids
couldn't have cared less. Nick spent the rest of the day making
friends on the beach and goofing off in the water. Martin took John
to the 1929 Catalina Casino, the island's most recognizable landmark,
with ballrooms and a theater with Art Deco murals.</TE>
<TE>   For dinner we bought clams from Armstrong's Fish Market &amp; Seafood
Restaurant, a highly recommended establishment by the water, and made
clam linguine at the house.</TE>
<TE>   We were back at the Pancake Cottage the next morning, supposedly
at Nick's urging. He had found a new fascination: silver-dollar
pancakes. (I suspect Martin, fond of the restaurant's scrambled eggs
and bacon, had a hand in guiding us there too.) We knew the drill for
the boat ride home, so the wait didn't seem so bad. But before we
left, I wanted one last thing: a family photo.</TE>
<TE>   We lined up in the morning sun with the casino and the dark blue
sea in the background. We straightened John's shirt over his fat
tummy, wiped the blond hair out of Nick's eyes and waited to corral
someone to take the picture.</TE>
<TE>   We passed on a group of teens. An older couple in khakis and
Hawaiian shirts looked promising, but they turned away before
reaching us. Finally a young couple came by. When the guy said
"cheese," we smiled.</TE>
<TE>   The picture came back blurry. I had forgotten to switch the camera
to automatic focus. But you can still make out four figures, a new
family on their first vacation.</TE>

<LD>Confronting the necessary inconveniences of heightened airport
security but hoping to keep as much joy in the journey as possible,
Americans can gear up for the new vacation season with equal measures
of strategy and whimsy. On the shelves is a slew of new travel
accessories and luggage that acknowledge harsh realities but also
say, "Hey, travel is supposed to be fun."</LD>
<LD>   "These days it's vital to be prepared for the annoyances of travel
but also to cheer yourself up with bright colors and fun gear," said
Ann Simmons, managing partner of Baggallini, an Oregon company that
makes candy-colored nylon totes and knapsacks that fold into their
own zippered pockets. The company was among 300 exhibitors hawking
their latest wares at the Travel Goods Assn. trade show last month in
New Orleans.</LD>
<LD>   Among the products engineered for these trying times:</LD>
<TE>   * ID and ticket holders--worn around the neck or flipped open from
wallets--with see-through windows to make inspection faster and
reduce the risk of loss. (Airports have reported an epidemic of
mislaid drivers' licenses now that passengers are required to show
IDs at multiple checkpoints.)</TE>
<TE>   * Mini tumbler locks with extra large numerals to help aging eyes
more quickly dial the combination for those surprise baggage checks.</TE>
<TE>   * Locking luggage straps that ratchet to make tightening easier,
deter tampering and speed identification with their red stripe and
built-in identification tag.</TE>
<TE>   * New splashy luggage that includes wheel-aboard bags in faux
zebra, leopard or tiger prints; garment carriers in Egyptian pharaoh
motifs; and matching sets in ruby red, tartan plaid or "Masai Mara"
(with monkeys, rhinos and kudu ambling along a canvas veldt). If the
trend continues, you may have no trouble spotting your black nylon
bag on the conveyor belt: "There it is--the dowdy one."</TE>
<TE>   Even luggage locks have taken on a perkier appearance, embossed
with sailboats, golf greens and red rosebuds.</TE>
<TE>   "Those mellow scenes are soothing; they make people smile," says
Brian Kelleher of Franzus Products, which makes the lifestyle-themed
locks along with matching luggage straps and tags.</TE>
<TE>   Organizational Behavior</TE>
<TE>   One antidote to a world in disarray is organization. Eagle Creek,
a forerunner in everything-in-its-place packing envelopes and cubes,
now has plenty of competition for its innovative organizers, which
can ward off wrinkles, help partition the suitcase and keep like
things together, such as liquids or, say, dirty laundry.</TE>
<TE>   New this season are Swiss Army Brands' zippered Pop-Up Packing
Cubes, with sturdy side panels that cushion fragile items;
Gore-Vaughn Enterprises' Spandex Travel Pockets, with elasticized
subdivisions for separating toiletries and medications within
suitcases; and Travelon's seven-piece set of zippered mesh packing
envelopes in various sizes.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be outdone, Eagle Creek has plenty of new offerings,
including a Pack-It Starter Set with three of the company's most
popular organizers (an envelope, a cube and a sac) and a video on how
best to use them. And to think some people are still wedded to
Ziplocs.</TE>
<TE>   Some travel bags are complete systems unto themselves. Travelpro's
expandable Platinum 3 ballistic nylon wheel-aboard, in black or
snappy cadet blue, has a built-in waterproof laundry bag, a padded
suit compartment, a detachable hanging toilet kit and a nylon
ticket/passport holder.</TE>
<TE>   To help speed you through security, the internal compartments in
Samsonite's Instant View carry-ons are mesh or clear plastic so
security personnel can take a peek without rumpling the goods.</TE>
<TE>   High Sierra's Sport Utility Trunks--a sort of steamer trunk for
hikers--have hinged flip-over "wings" that act like drawers, while
the vast main compartment can hold a mother lode of clothing.</TE>
<TE>   The Skyroll shoulder bag is a hollow cylinder, about the width of
a regular suit bag, with a detachable garment bag that wraps around
it. Suits, dresses and other garments are said to stay wrinkle-free
in the bag, while shoes, toiletries and small items go in the
zippered cylinder.</TE>
<TE>   Size matters. Bulky wheeled bags that once successfully got past
carry-on restrictions may not make it through security checkpoints in
these stricter times. Eighteen-inch roll-aboards (well within the
rules) are gaining popularity over 22-inchers, which can be a tight
fit in some overhead bins, especially if the outside pockets are
full.</TE>
<TE>   Comfort Zone</TE>
<TE>   Comfort has become especially important in the face of long
airport waits and airborne anxieties.</TE>
<TE>   "The weight of the world seems upon us all, and we wanted to
provide something nurturing and snuggable to make travelers feel
good," said David Coats, the co-president of Bucky, a manufacturer of
cushy pillows with loose millet hulls that mold to the contours of
the body.</TE>
<TE>   Bucky has created a new line of neck and back pillows in soft
imitation suede, brightly hued cotton velour and faux fur. Matching
padded eye shades come with earplugs that stash in a built-in pocket.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have access to a microwave or conventional oven at their
destination will like the company's new Hotties--buckwheat-filled
pillows and wraps you heat for a few minutes, then apply to muscles
aching from the journey. (They also can be chilled for cooling
therapy.) Hotties, made of plush chenille, come with a removable
herbal sachet for further soothing the senses.</TE>
<TE>   Pulling a loaded roll-aboard can put stress on your wrist, neck
and shoulders. Travelpro's newly designed Pro-Grip handle system has
a rubberized grip that flips up from the regular handle; it's easier
to pull and seems less ergonomically taxing.</TE>
<TE>   The curved telescoping "mono-pole" on Swiss Army Brands' new
SwissWerks wheeled bags has a swivel handle that locks into a more
natural position.</TE>
<TE>   Easing the load also was what AirPacks had in mind with its
knapsacks and backpacks, which have inflatable lumbar supports and
straps.</TE>
<TE>   When you get tired of standing in those long lines, you can take a
seat atop any hard-sided wheel-aboard using Samsonite's padded
Comfort Cushion, which fits over the carry handle.</TE>
<TE>   For Women Only</TE>
<TE>   Bags for women are classier than they've been in years. Hartmann's
new Career Collection Executive Women's Totes, in red or black, come
with a matching computer briefcase and detachable mini purse that's
dressy enough for a dinner date or business occasion.</TE>
<TE>   The shoulder strap on Hobo's teardrop-shaped Italian leather sling
unzips up the middle and becomes back straps. And get a load of the
flashy color choices: black with a red lining, red with chartreuse
lining or caramel brown with pumpkin lining.</TE>
<TE>   Kipling's featherweight crinkled nylon California Sport Bags,
which come in blue, red, wine or pistachio and are about the size of
a gym bag, provide plenty of open space and stylish stitching, and
the included matching little stuffed gorilla key chain is a fun
gimmick.</TE>
<TE>   Women of a certain age, take note: Those big, boxy beauty cases of
yesteryear are making a comeback, but now they have hinged makeup
trays and velveteen linings and come in space-age aluminum or
transparent acrylic (from Vanguard). They hark back to more civilized
times when women donned white gloves for their journeys and a lap top
was part of one's anatomy, used to balance a beauty case while
checking one's teeth for lipstick.</TE>

<HD>Conquering the Grand Canyon</HD>
<DH>Six determined women make it to the bottom and back on a
beginner's trek that fulfills dreams--and punishes bodies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK--There are six of us, all women, sitting
in the dusk about 1,300 feet above the Colorado River. The rock
"temples" of the canyon surround us, Shiva and Isis to the left,
Brahma and Zoroaster to the right. All eyes are trained on a maiden
moon, draped in gossamer clouds, hanging in the darkening sky. No one
says a word. Everything is just the way we like it.</LD>
<LD>   Tucked away safely in my mind and captioned "Six Women Gazing at
the Moon on Plateau Point," this Ansel Adams moment somehow captures
how the Grand Canyon affects people. Maybe awe of its grandeur strips
away human egotism, reconnecting us to our small place in nature's
scheme. Or maybe, as Melanie Miles, the leader of our little band of
hikers believes, people come here for different reasons and take away
whatever it is they need.</LD>
<TE>   Miles is an instructor with the Grand Canyon Field Institute. Like
other field institutes associated with U.S. national parks, this is a
nonprofit educational organization that offers in-depth outdoor
programs on ecology, geology, photography, archeology, wilderness
survival and other pursuits "in the field." Most are reasonably
priced (mine cost $355, not including food, equipment and
accommodations on the canyon rim) and involve hiking and camping.
(The park service's interpretive programs, in contrast, last only a
few hours and tend to stick to the heavily traveled South Rim.) "The
field institute fills a need the park can't by providing back-country
trips for people who don't want to do them on their own," says Judy
Hellmich, head of the Grand Canyon's interpretive program.</TE>
<TE>   Some field institute programs are easy, perhaps for families.
Others are for experienced wilderness trekkers. My "Women's
Introductory Backpack: Colorado River" program was based on a
recognition that many women experience the wilderness differently
from men. Programs like this one are intended to teach women their
own brand of self-sufficiency in the outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   Miles, a 5-foot-5, 110-pound Englishwoman who fell in love with
the canyon 16 years ago on a cross-country bus trip, swears she has
to use a clipboard and lift something heavy at the beginning of coed
programs to gain the confidence of the men. She remembers only one
man bursting into tears at first sight of the Colorado River after
the hike down to the canyon bottom; women do it all the time.</TE>
<TE>   But there I will leave it, because the story of my trip--seven
miles down South Kaibab Trail from the South Rim to Bright Angel
Campground at canyon bottom, then back up Bright Angel Trail to
Indian Garden and the rim again--hasn't anything to do with men. It
has to do with six women between 35 and 55 and the goals they met by
taking part in the program.</TE>
<TE>   The trip wouldn't impress canyon veterans or lovers of extreme
sports. It was a Grand Canyon classic, down and up trails trod by
thousands, with a two-night stay at the Bright Angel Campground and a
final night at Indian Garden Campground, halfway up the South Rim, to
break up the tough climb out. Only 5% of the roughly 5 million people
who visit the Grand Canyon every year go below the rim, and only
about 10% of those make it to the river.</TE>
<TE>   The canyon is a vertical world, extremely hard to hike. The South
Kaibab and Bright Angel trails, which lose about 5,000 feet in
elevation from rim to bottom, severely tax lungs, knees and thighs.
In the stiflingly hot summer, people blithely embark from the South
Rim without enough water, expecting to reach the river and climb back
out in a day. Some turn around partway down, exhausted. More than 400
people were rescued in the Grand Canyon last year, a national park
system high.</TE>
<TE>   The women in my group would make it all the way, with dignity,
Melanie assured us. She surely would. At 37, Melanie has trekked from
rim to river to rim at least 75 times, and between hikes works as a
Colorado River rafting guide.</TE>
<TE>   The first day was spent largely in a classroom at the field
institute headquarters. We had filled out lengthy health
questionnaires and knew what to expect because the field institute
brochure carefully rates the difficulty of its trips (ours was a
3-plus on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the toughest). In class, we
shared our reasons for taking part in the program. Melanie, who looks
more like an elf than an Amazon, says women tend to want to talk
about an impending challenge as a way of processing their emotions
and getting support, while men just want to go out there and get
through it. But there was little fear or soul-searching in my group.</TE>
<TE>   Becki Fink, a pharmacist from Tucson whose husband stayed on the
rim, said she wanted to gain self-sufficiency in the wilderness. Anne
Douville, from Oakland, was on an extended vacation in the Southwest,
preparing in the Grand Canyon for backpacking in Zion National Park.
Kathy Gohl, a freelance editor from Vermont, had come to see how
hiking in the West compares with hiking in the East. And Judy Jagla,
from Sedona, Ariz., was an inveterate walker who felt the need to get
more comfortable with camping out. I just wanted to make it down and
back again under my own steam, find a place to wash my hair at the
bottom and take notes for this story.</TE>
<TE>   After the introductions, Melanie talked about health and safety,
especially how to avoid heat exhaustion and hypothermia. As hikers
descend to the bottom, the temperature rises as much as 20 degrees.
And there is no fresh water on South Kaibab Trail, meaning we each
had to fit at least three quarts of water in our packs. We brought
all our gear to the session and spread it out around us so Melanie
could help us assess what we actually needed. Comparing equipment was
instructive.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe how light your tent is."</TE>
<TE>   "That sports bra looks comfortable. Where did you get it?"</TE>
<TE>   "Look, Kathy's got freeze-dried Thai noodles."</TE>
<TE>   Then Melanie displayed the contents of her pack, an inspiration to
us all: sleeping bag, medical kit, headlight, map, cookstove, food,
eating utensils and a plastic ground cover (used as a tent when
weather prohibits her from sleeping under the stars), all in less
than 30 pounds. She would start out wearing most of the clothes she
needed for the four-day hike. She had no use for shampoo because she
didn't plan to wash her hair.</TE>
<TE>   As we jettisoned extraneous pillows and espresso makers, Melanie
gave us useful tidbits of advice. These were the sorts of things
Martha Stewart might know if she went into the wilderness but no one
had ever shared with me before: how to dress a blister; the benefits
of taking off your hiking shoes and elevating your much-abused feet
at rest stops; keeping snack food handy; getting your head wet when
overheated; and the danger of long toenails on boot-bound feet.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning we shuttled to the trail head, about five miles
east of Grand Canyon Village.</TE>
<TE>   South Kaibab is steeper, shorter and newer than Bright Angel
Trail, slicing through all the layers of the canyon's geologic club
sandwich in its dramatic descent. Melanie pointed out the different
kinds of rocks as we passed them--Kaibab limestone, Toroweap
formation, Coconino sandstone, Hermit shale, Supai group, Redwall
limestone, Muav limestone, Bright Angel shale and Tapeats
sandstone--and taught us two mnemonics to remember them in order:
"Know The Canyon History; Study Rocks Made By Time" and "Kissing
Takes Concentration; However, Sex Requires More Breath And Time."</TE>
<TE>   Most of us had doffed an outer layer of clothes by the time we
reached Ooh Aah Point, three-quarters of a mile below the rim, where
we all posed for pictures on a rock throne, dangling our feet over a
cliff. We debated whether going down was harder than going up, put
our legs in an easy third gear while crossing the relatively flat
Tonto Plateau and ate lunch at the Tipoff, where we could plainly see
the Coconino layer on the North Rim, which looks like a dirty ring
around a bathtub.</TE>
<TE>   From there South Kaibab got steeper as it wound downward,
burrowing through a short tunnel before reaching the Colorado River
at the Kaibab Bridge. By then it was late afternoon, and about half
the group wouldn't have walked down another hill if there had been a
forest fire behind them. I was in the other half, all downhill
racers, happy as long as we didn't think about the prospect of the
trip back up. Fortunately, all that remained was to put one foot in
front of the other for a mile or so until we reached the campground,
strung out along the west side of rushing Bright Angel Creek and,
behind it, like a set for a Greek tragedy, a looming wall of Vishnu
schist, the 2-billion-year-old red-black rock at the bottom of the
canyon.</TE>
<TE>   (Explorers at the turn of the century tapped their interest in
comparative religion by giving names to Grand Canyon landforms. So on
the North Rim, there are buttes named for the gods and holy men of
Hinduism, Buddhism and other religions. The ancient glinting rock at
canyon bottom is named for Vishnu, the Hindu preserver of the
universe.)</TE>
<TE>   Most of the women in my group reverted to domestic habits by
setting up camp immediately. But Melanie and I bathed in the creek
with our clothes on, washing out socks and T-shirts at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   We cooked our dinners while the sun set: Mine was macaroni and
cheese, followed by cookies and a cup of chamomile tea. Melanie
showed us how to clean our bowls without dumping out any scraps,
prohibited in leave-no-trace camping. The procedure involved licking
the bowl, then making tea in it. Once you finish the tea and the
leftover dinner crumbs in it, the bowl can be packed.</TE>
<TE>   That's the only thing Melanie ever did that disgusted me. But
after dinner she made up for it by reading to us from "Grand Canyon
Women," a book by Betty Leavengood. The chapter she chose was about
pioneer Colorado River runner Georgie White Clark, who twice drifted
down the river in the '40s in nothing but a bathing suit and a life
preserver. Her commercial river trips were notoriously hair-raising,
with unchanging menus of boiled eggs, canned stew and beer.
Nonetheless, when she asked her clients how they were doing, they
were expected to reply, "Everything is just the way we like it."</TE>
<TE>   We spent the next day visiting beautiful old Phantom Ranch, across
the creek from the campground, and hiking into Phantom Canyon, where
we found a deep hole for skinny-dipping. That night, some went to the
ranch for beer and a ranger program on 19th century Colorado River
explorer John Wesley Powell. But I stayed back at camp, doing nothing
except wondering when I'd ever get back to this otherworldly place.</TE>
<TE>   The following day we said goodbye to the river and turned onto
Bright Angel Trail. Desert bighorn sheep followed our progress from
high rocky perches, and after lunch we explored an ancient cliff
dwelling just above Devil's Corkscrew. We settled in at Indian Garden
Campground, ate early and then walked out to Plateau Point.</TE>
<TE>   We were tired, dirty and uneasy about the next morning's prospect
of hiking up the final segment, the hardest and steepest of the trip.
Everyone got up early and broke camp quickly. It was only a 4.6-mile
hike, but we wanted to get the ordeal over with. Our packs were a
little lighter than they had been going in because of the food we'd
consumed, so I started out briskly, second in line behind Becki.</TE>
<TE>   She never let up, but when I hit Jacob's Ladder, a wicked set of
switchbacks carved along a fault line in the Redwall limestone, my
pace slowed to a stagger. My pack felt like the weight of the world,
and, with each step, every muscle in my body cursed me. Anne, Judy
and Kathy soon passed me by. I had only the consolation of impressing
day hikers headed down to Indian Garden. Melanie stayed behind me, to
try to restart my heart if I collapsed. But I kept going and finally
celebrated with my comrades at the top.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure I finished with dignity, but, thankfully, time has
made me almost forget the rigors of the hike out. But I do remember
how it feels when six women sit together in stillness looking into
the Grand Canyon and that I made it down to the bottom and back. They
can put that on my tombstone, which I'd like to be made of Vishnu
schist.</TE>

<LD>Many national parks have field institutes aimed at providing outdoor
educational programs. The oldest and largest of these are in
Yosemite, Yellowstone, Grand Canyon and Rocky Mountain national
parks. Rocky Mountain alone annually sponsors 105 field seminars.</LD>
<LD>   Some are offshoots of nonprofit groups, such as the Grand Canyon
Assn. It has raised $18 million for the Arizona park in the last 60
years through book publishing, sales and educational programs. The
field institute contributions help fill gaps between federal money
earmarked for national parks and what the parks need to keep running.</LD>

<LD>Type the phrase "travel health" into one Internet search engine and
you'll get 3.5 million hits. Besides reliable sources, such as the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the search brings
up Web sites run by individuals or pitchmen with products to sell. So
how can you know which sites to trust?</LD>
<LD>   For answers, I turned to Dr. Phyllis Kozarsky, chief of travelers'
health for the CDC, and Dr. David Freedman, professor of medicine and
epidemiology/international health at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham.</LD>
<LD>   With another travel medicine expert, Dr. Jay Keystone, an
internist and professor at the University of Toronto and the Toronto
Hospital and a past president of the International Society of Travel
Medicine, they recently scoured the Web looking for reliable travel
health information and published their findings in the journal
Clinical Infectious Diseases. They noted that each had been a
consultant to one or more of the Internet sites mentioned.</LD>
<TE>   Among their votes for the most reliable travel health information:</TE>
<TE>   * Travelers' health information on the CDC site, www.cdc.gov,
includes the new interactive "Yellow Book," the CDC's bible of health
information for international travel, with immunization guidelines,
disease data and other facts. (Its formal title is "Health
Information for International Travel," and it is reissued every two
years.)</TE>
<TE>   The current online edition, for 2001-02, is a big improvement from
the cumbersome previous online versions. Now travel medicine
experts--as well as the legions of consumers who refer to the
book--can access specific information quickly, thanks to drop-down
menus for all the major subjects. Want to know which vaccines you
need for a specific country? Just choose "vaccination information."</TE>
<TE>   * The World Health Organization's site, www.who.int, includes
malaria risk by country plus general travel advice, with maps showing
the locations of infectious disease outbreaks. (To find them, scroll
to "Traveller's health," then click on "Full story," then "Disease
maps.") There's a section on outbreaks and an archive by year and by
disease.</TE>
<TE>   * Health Canada's Travel Medicine Program site, www.hc-sc.gc.ca
/hpb/lcdc/osh/tmpe.html, includes antimalarial recommendations,
outbreak information, immunization recommendations and travelers'
health advisories. It's meant for Canadians but has much information
of use to U.S. residents too.</TE>
<TE>   These sites, meant more for the traveling public than for travel
medicine experts, also got a nod of approval:</TE>
<TE>   * Travelhealth Online, at www.tripprep.com, has data on subjects
as diverse as altitude sickness and yellow fever. Freedman, among
other travel medicine consultants, has helped the site develop its
information. It lists travel medicine specialists but says it cannot
vouch for their credentials. (But neither do two other sites that
list such experts--the International Society of Travel Medicine,
www.istm.org, and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and
Hygiene, www.astmh.org.)</TE>
<TE>   * Fit for Travel at www.fit-for-travel.de/en/index.html, run by
the University of Munich Tropical Institute, has information on
vaccinations and malaria and news updates on topics such as recent
disease outbreaks.</TE>
<TE>   * Lonely Planet Health, www.lonelyplanet.com/health, run by the
guidebook publishers, has sections on predeparture planning, keeping
healthy while traveling and women's health, along with a host of
links.</TE>
<TE>   * Medicine Planet, at www.medicineplanet.com, offers its mobile
health information services for $4.95 a month, providing access to
medical professionals and referrals when needed, but it also posts
information that travelers can access for free. For instance, there's
a medicine name translator: Plug in the name of your prescription
medicine and the country you'll be visiting, and it finds the brand
name of the drug at your destination.</TE>
<TE>   Freedman advises travelers generally to avoid travel medicine Web
sites run by individuals. He says the information is more likely to
be inaccurate than information posted by a larger site that has more
personnel, and that a smaller site is less likely to update
information quickly.</TE>

<HD>Exercising Your Options While Far From Home</HD>
<DH>Travelers hankering for a workout needn't settle just for
the hotel gym. Some of the alternatives can even spice up a vacation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On hectic days at work, when I daydream about a vacation, I see
myself lounging around by the water in some tropical locale, flipping
through trashy gossip magazines and sipping Day-Glo drinks that
sprout tiny umbrellas.</LD>
<LD>   On an actual vacation, that works for me for about an hour. Then I
need to hike through town, jump on an exercise bike, anything to get
moving. Apparently so do many of you.</LD>
<LD>   More than one in four Americans visited a fitness center or gym in
recent years while traveling, a survey by the Travel Industry Assn.
of America shows.</LD>
<TE>   It's getting easier to work out without leaving your hotel. More
than two-thirds of U.S. hotels have health or fitness centers,
compared with about one-third in 1988, according to the 2001 Lodging
Survey that Smith Travel Research did for the American Hotel &amp;
Lodging Assn. But it's also getting more expensive to use them.
Nearly 90% of U.S. hotel gyms were free to guests in 1994, compared
with 62% last year, the same survey found.</TE>
<TE>   For a more adventurous--or sometimes misadventurous--option, you
can't beat hitting the streets to jog or to find a gym away from your
hotel, says Suzanne Schlosberg, a Santa Monica-based health and humor
writer who has written "Fitness for Travelers: The Ultimate Workout
Guide for the Road," to be published later this month by Houghton
Mifflin. It's a useful and often funny book for anyone who wants to
work up a sweat away from home.</TE>
<TE>   Take jogging. It's a great way to see the local sights and
exercise, but it can also get you into trouble. In her book,
Schlosberg recounts the tale of artist Cristina Acosta of Bend, Ore.,
who was staying at an upscale Orlando hotel set amid canals. Says
Acosta: "When I walked through the lobby in my running clothes and
waved to the concierge, she said, 'Wait, you can't go running around
here. Don't you know about the alligators?'" Acosta told me she went
jogging anyway but changed her route to avoid the canal area.</TE>
<TE>   Another jogger, this time in Chad, ran into five armed guards at a
palace. "They all pointed guns at me, and I backed up real slowly,
trying to show them I had no weapons," David Negus, deputy controller
for a D.C.-based nonprofit, is quoted as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Schlosberg told me, "I had more stories than I could use" about
lost or surprised joggers. Her advice: Consult the concierge or a
local running-gear store about routes before striking out, and wear a
pack carrying ID, the phone number and address of your hotel, and a
cell phone. I would add one more item: a compass.</TE>
<TE>   As for gyms, Schlosberg's book offers an overview of facilities at
major hotel chains. Generally, the larger and more upscale the
lodging, the more likely you are to find a gym there. Only 12% of
budget hotels have gyms, compared with 83% of luxury hotels,
according to the 2001 Lodging Survey.</TE>
<TE>   Be sure to ask what's in the gym before plunking down your money.
Schlosberg writes that she was inspired to develop her book after
handing over her credit card to the gym at a hotel in Marrakech,
Morocco, and then finding out it consisted of "a small, stuffy room
with a collection of America's most disgraced infomercial exercise
gadgets," including a "treadmill with a belt that did not move unless
you propelled it yourself, a very scary piece of machinery that would
have collapsed under the weight of Kate Moss."</TE>
<TE>   Although Schlosberg says that hotel gyms have improved, she
confessed to me that she doesn't use them during the six weeks or
more that she typically spends on the road each year.</TE>
<TE>   "I travel really cheap," she said. "I tend to stay at a Motel 6
and find a gym nearby." Such clubs are apt to have more extensive
facilities than even well-equipped hotel gyms, which often favor
machines over free weights to avoid liability issues. Some hotels may
have deals that let guests use a nearby gym at no or low cost. But
for Schlosberg, "it's part of the fun of the trip to see where I can
find the best workout."</TE>
<TE>   A case in point was a cross-country bike trip she took with a
group a few years back. In the wide-open spaces of west Texas, "we
went for days without seeing a gym," she recalled. "So we stopped at
the local high schools and worked out with the football players." On
a camping trip in Alaska last year, she did pull-ups hanging off the
Alaska pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Have an hour to kill between flights? "You can get a decent
workout just walking around the airport," she said. Her book also
recommends climbing stairs at your hotel or jumping rope--easily
packed--for an improvised cardio session.</TE>
<TE>   To work off the Vegas blues, McCarran International Airport offers
a full-service, 14,000-square-foot gym, which it opened in 2000, says
Shannon May, spokeswoman for 24 Hour Fitness, which operates the
club. A guest pass costs $15 per day. For $30 you can get a workout
package that includes the pass and rented gym shoes, plus shorts,
shirt, towel and socks that are yours to keep.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet is handy for finding gyms in your destination before
you leave home. Schlosberg recommends www.healthclubs.com and
www.nutricise.com, which have thousands of listings searchable by
location. Chains such as Bally, Gold's Gym and 24 Hour Fitness may
give you access to out-of-state clubs; charges and terms vary. A
guest pass for the day may typically cost $10 to $20. More than 1,000
of the 2,400 YMCAs in the U.S. allow visitors from other Ys;
restrictions vary.</TE>
<TE>   For finding swimming pools, Schlosberg and Mariana Field Hoppin, a
New York publicist who logs about 60,000 air miles a year and swims
an hour every day, recommend www.swimmersguide.com. About 35% of U.S.
hotels have indoor pools, and 39% have outdoor pools, according to
the 2001 Lodging Survey.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hoppin has some favorite hotels for pools, such as the
Bel-Air Hotel in Los Angeles (oval-shaped, up to 10 feet deep and
"absolutely glorious") and the Inter-Continental Hotel in Chicago
(huge windows and stadium seating personify grandeur at this venue,
formerly the vintage-1929 Medinah Athletic Club), she generally
prefers nonhotel pools.</TE>
<TE>   Hoppin's pet peeves include pools that are too small (she prefers
at least Olympic junior-size, 25 meters), too shallow (newer ones may
be under 4 feet, she says) or overheated. "Swimming in a hot pool is
like swimming in hot tea," she says. Her advice: Call the pool to get
the rules and tips on when it's least crowded, and plan to swim early
if you're serious about getting in some lane time. You'll find Hoppin
splashing by 6 a.m. or even earlier.</TE>
<TE>   While I admire Hoppin's determination, the notion of hitting the
water in the predawn is daunting. Frankly, it's enough to set me
daydreaming of lounge chairs and Day-Glo drinks again.</TE>

<LD>Having returned March 29 from Bora-Bora, I read Debbie Seaman's
article ("Awash in Tropical Bliss on Bora-Bora," March 31) hoping to
relive the same exhilarating experience we had through another's
prism.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, I read the report of a tourist experiencing the ups
and downs of traveling with small children to the most romantic isle
in the world. Bora-Bora captivates like no other destination. It's
not a family-oriented spot. It's for couples only. It's for couples
wishing to solder the foundation of a new relationship; for newlyweds
wishing to put an idyllic, slow-paced bow on their hectic marriage
ceremony; for couples wishing to renew their marriage vows on a
special anniversary; or for older adults who wish to embrace the
ultimate paradise.</LD>
<LD>   Bora-Bora is a destination solely for romantics.</LD>

<LD>Delta's food policy, which was quoted in "Taking a Long Flight? Don't
Come Hungry" (Travel Insider, March 24), is meaningless.</LD>
<LD>   I traveled to Las Vegas from the Washington, D.C., area,
connecting in Atlanta, a few months ago. The total flight and
connection time was more than seven hours each way, with the longest
flight about 41/2 hours. Did I get a meal? I got a small bag of a
salty snack and a cup of juice on each flight, with no time to get
food during my connection. Because my longer flight was more than
four hours, I assumed I would get a meal, and I learned my lesson the
hard way.</LD>

<LD>Susan Spano always manages to get it right. "In Praise of a Simple
Food That Helps the World Keep Its Sunny Side Up" (Her World, March
31) triggered a memorable moment: the sandwich I purchased from a
vending machine at the train station in Belfast, Northern Ireland. My
mouth waters just thinking about it: sitting on that train unwrapping
the crinkly cellophane, the cool, slightly hard but tasty white bread
stuck to the creamy egg salad. The best surprise, however, was
discovering the minuscule pieces of bacon throughout. Delicious.</LD>

<LD>It's too bad Tom Gorman went to the Bellagio Sunday brunch ("In Sin
City, a Spot Worth Coveting," Weekend Escape, April 7). If he had
stayed at the Palms and enjoyed Sunday brunch at the newly opened
Garduno's restaurant in the hotel, he would have enjoyed the finest
chile verde and sopaipillas west of New Mexico. We have driven to
Albuquerque just for a "Garduno's fix," and now it is just a few
hours away.</LD>

<LD>While reading Susan Spano's article ("The Best Beach in the World?"
Los Angeles Times Magazine, Special Travel Issue, March 17), I
immediately became nostalgic about my trip to the exotic Seychelles
islands in March 2000.</LD>
<LD>   My husband and I put the trip together ourselves. I got a great
fare to Rome on Alitalia Airlines, and from Rome we flew Air
Seychelles to the islands. My husband made the hotel reservations
online. We visited the same three islands as Spano, staying at Lazare
Picault. We rented a car and used local buses to explore.</LD>
<LD>   It was worth it to go halfway around the world to see the surreal
beauty of the Seychelles.</LD>

<CP>PHOTO: Helen Weinman wanted to meet a cheetah in Kenya. She
didn't know there would be seven of them: these five cubs and their
mother, plus another little one hiding in back. In July, Weinman
visited the Masai Mara Game Reserve, where a guide led her and five
friends to this family of cats by an anthill. Weinman's group watched
the world's fastest land animals on a chase--for one another's tails.
Says the Torrance reader, "They were just like little kittens."</CP>

<BD>TIMES TRAVEL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of the most moving cities in the world are cities of the dead,
worth a traveler's time for their art and history and the respite
they provide as islands of green in the middle of strident modern
cities of the living.</LD>
<LD>   I think fondly of Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, on a hill overlooking
Concord, Mass., with the graves of Louisa May Alcott and Henry David
Thoreau; the atmospheric above-ground graveyards of New Orleans, such
as St. Louis Cemetery near the French Quarter; and Arlington National
Cemetery, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., a fine
place to see the cherry blossoms in spring.</LD>
<LD>   Above all, I recall riding a bike in the rain several years ago to
Pere Lachaise in Paris, a French who's who of a cemetery with the
graves of Edith Piaf, Yves Montand, Colette, Georges Seurat, Frederic
Chopin, Oscar Wilde and Jim Morrison of the Doors.</LD>
<TE>   "To be buried in Pere Lachaise," Victor Hugo once said, "is like
having mahogany furniture."</TE>
<TE>   The bike ride wasn't particularly pleasant in heavy traffic, but
the rain was perfect. Once I walked through the gate, I was in
another world.</TE>
<TE>   Everything smelled of wet leaves and old stone, and the tombs were
spectacularly lugubrious, decorated with cracked ivy-draped urns,
hands reaching out of the grave and mossy weeping angels.</TE>
<TE>   My friend Linda Yellin loves Pere Lachaise, where she always
wanders aimlessly. It inspired Katie Karrick, a Cleveland cemetery
historian who writes the newsletter "Tomb With a View," and it
spurred Judi Culbertson to become co- author of guidebooks on the
cemeteries of London, Paris, Italy, California and New York
(published by Walker &amp; Co.).</TE>
<TE>   Karrick says Pere Lachaise started a reform movement in 19th
century America that replaced dour old Colonial burial grounds with
lushly sculpted melancholy cemeteries, landscaped like English
gardens. In the Victorian age, Pere Lachaise inspired graveyards in
the U.S. such as Mount Auburn in Boston; Mountain View Cemetery in
Oakland, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted; and Green-Wood in
Brooklyn, with the graves of Currier and Ives and a stunning Gothic
Revival gatehouse. They were considered tourist attractions in their
own right, visited by photographers, day-trippers and dignitaries.</TE>
<TE>   There's plenty a traveler can learn or recall at a cemetery.
Visiting pioneer burial grounds in California, author Culbertson is
struck by the many graves of children, all dating from the same time,
suggesting they died during an epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   The Old Jewish Cemetery beside Remuh Synagogue, in the Kazimierz
section of Krakow, Poland, has a mosaic-like wall, made of pieces of
tombs destroyed during the Nazi occupation. Tourists visit Hollywood
Forever Cemetery, in a slightly shabby neighborhood north of
Paramount Studios, to pay their respects to Rudolph Valentino, Peter
Lorre and Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel, now all bit players in eternity.</TE>
<TE>   I stopped by Hollywood Forever on a recent Saturday morning. In
the flower shop near the front gate, the man who sold me a map told
me to have a nice stay, which made us both laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "Cemeteries are really not depressing at all," says Culbertson.
"The people entombed there are happy to have you come." Culbertson
suspects that graveyard visitors often get a little frisson of joy as
they scrutinize funerary monuments and think to themselves, "You're
there; I'm not."</TE>
<TE>   Many travelers visit graveyards for the tombs and epitaphs.
"People like me have discovered that cemeteries are filled with
beautiful Colonial and Victorian art," historian Karrick says. "All
the major revival styles of architecture are represented there, from
Greek to Gothic to Egyptian."</TE>
<TE>   The epitaphs often are enchanting, "the last communication of the
dead with the living," says Larrian Gillespie, who has mounted a
campaign to restore the Victorian cemeteries of Mendocino County in
Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Some epitaphs could put starch in your shirt. Fred Oakley, a
member of the Assn. for Gravestone Studies in Greenfield, Mass., has
a favorite, often seen in Colonial cemeteries, such as Boston's
Copp's Hill Burial Ground, founded in 1659:</TE>
<TE>   "Stop and note as you pass by.</TE>
<TE>   "As you are now, so once was I.</TE>
<TE>   "As I am now, so you will be.</TE>
<TE>   "Prepare for death and follow me."</TE>
<TE>   The graves of famous people also attract visitors. It's easy to
figure out who lies where by using such Internet sites as
www.findagrave.com and www.politicalgraveyard.com and books like "The
Tombstone Tourist: Musicians," by Scott Stanton (3T Publishing,
1998).</TE>
<TE>   In my salad days, I made a special trip to Oxford, Miss., to drink
bourbon at William Faulkner's grave. Two years ago I found Frank
Sinatra's resting place in Desert Memorial Park outside Palm Springs,
marked by a simple stone engraved with "The Best Is Yet to Come," a
song Ol' Blue Eyes recorded in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   My most memorable cemetery trip was unplanned. I was walking north
of Peterborough, N.H., the classic old New England village that is
thought to have inspired "Our Town," by Thornton Wilder, who worked
on the play at the MacDowell Colony, an artists' retreat nearby. As I
crested a hill, I saw a small, dilapidated graveyard surrounded by
nothing but sky. I knew in my heart I had found the cemetery that
serves as the setting for the last act of "Our Town," in which Wilder
wrote, "An awful lot of sorrow has sort of quieted down up here."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, maybe that's what I find by visiting cemeteries far
and wide, even when I don't know or care about the people buried
there, a quieting of the nameless sorrows that all travelers carry
through life.</TE>

<KH>A Taste of Travel</KH>
<HD>In Victoria, Hip Hops Spots</HD>
<DH>Brewing talents are becoming fully ingrained in British
Columbia's capital city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGO PFEIFF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>VICTORIA, Canada</DL>
<LD>Tea has always been this city's trademark brew. Afternoon tea, where
a cuppa involves choosing from a roll call of plantations in
Darjeeling, Ceylon and Kenya, is the equivalent of Miller Time in
this staid provincial capital.</LD>
<LD>   Then, one drizzly West Coast afternoon, I wandered into Spinnakers
Brewpub, where a glass of malty India Pale Ale made me sit up and pay
attention. A chaser of Jameson's Scotch Ale confirmed my suspicion
that there was more abrew in Victoria than tea leaves: beer, another
fine British tradition.</LD>
<LD>   Spinnakers, it turns out, is only one stop on a hoppy route
through this southern Vancouver Island city. Victoria's two
microbreweries--the Vancouver Island Brewing Co. and the Lighthouse
Brewing Co.--and its four brew pubs now produce some of the best
beers in British Columbia.</LD>
<TE>   Victoria's brews are well known in Canada's beer-loving community,
as is the fact that Victoria boasts one of the most vibrant beer
cultures of any city in the country. Each November the Great Canadian
Beer Festival is held in Victoria. (It's Nov. 22 and 23 this year;
for information, see www.gcbf.com.) But the brews are not available
outside the province and usually can't be sampled outside local brew
pubs.</TE>
<TE>   I came to British Columbia last October for a friend's wedding and
stayed at Amethyst Inn at Regents Park, a lovely restored Victorian
mansion that has been converted to a B&amp;B. The inn is in a residential
neighborhood a five-minute drive from the city center, near seaside
Beaconsfield Park. When I heard about Victoria's "ale trail," I
decided to stay an extra day to combine two of my favorite pastimes:
hiking and beer tasting.</TE>
<TE>   Hiking might seem an extreme word for traipsing the paved
sidewalks of Government and Pandora streets, but by the time you're
on your way to the fourth brew pub of the afternoon--they have a
combined offering of about 20 ales, lagers and stouts--walking
anywhere in a straight line feels like a trek of Himalayan
proportions.</TE>
<TE>   I could have taken a guided, half-day Ale Trail Tour by bus, which
includes visits to two more-distant microbreweries and meeting brew
masters elsewhere on Vancouver Island as well as the downtown brew
pubs. But because all four brew pubs are within easy walking distance
of one another in the heart of the city, I decided to go it alone in
sensible shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Walking beneath hanging flower baskets and past faux Beefeaters,
the stately, ivy-covered Empress Hotel and shops filled with Haida
Indian art, I crossed a short bridge on the harbor and started my
brew pub crawl at Spinnakers, perhaps the best known of Victoria's
pubs.</TE>
<TE>   It was early afternoon, and the pub and restaurant were still busy
with couples and families finishing lunch. The interior was bright
with sunlight streaming through picture windows, a cross between West
Coast cheeriness and the coziness of a British pub. I chose a table
outside on the balcony and watched sailboats heading out in a stiff
breeze and the arrival of the hydrofoil from downtown Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   When Paul Hadfield opened it in 1984, Spinnakers was not only at
the forefront of Victoria's artisan beer scene, but it was also
Canada's first licensed brew pub since Prohibition. Hadfield had to
fight against Victorian liquor licensing regulations and a provincial
government that sided with a disapproving consortium of national beer
corporations. He triumphed, and his brew pub, set on the waterfront
overlooking Victoria Harbor in an old public house, has been
expanding ever since.</TE>
<TE>   The taproom is a self-serve bar, where you order beer and food
from a cashier and pick it up when your number is called. Spinnakers
features West Coast fare for lunch and dinner and a selection of half
a dozen ales, delivered daily, that are "pulled" with tall porcelain
and brass handles that line the bar.</TE>
<TE>   The selection of beers changes frequently, with the seasons and at
the whim of the brew master. They range from light lagers to malty
ales and dark stouts. I sampled an India Pale Ale with my
fish-and-chips lunch and finished with delicious, rich and chocolaty
Tsarist Imperial Stout for dessert.</TE>
<TE>   In the more formal restaurant downstairs, chef Sean Brennan
experiments in cooking with beer, and brewery products pop up all
over the menu, from sourdough bread made with Hefeweizen, a golden,
unfiltered German-style wheat beer, to curries based on Scotch ales,
handmade "beer cheese" sprayed with Spinnakers wheat beer before
aging and "hop eggs Benedict."</TE>
<TE>   The spent grains from beer making are trucked to an organic farm,
where they are used as feed for organically raised Highland beef
cattle and turkeys, which then appear back on Spinnakers' menu.</TE>
<TE>   The sweet skim that rises during beer making tastes like molasses,
and Spinnakers dries it into crystals and uses it to sweeten the
house granola and to make "spongy chompers," honeycomb cloaked in
chocolate. Most desserts, except the apple pie, contain beer. To die
for are the stout ice cream with barley wine vinegar and an unlikely
sounding but plate-licking-delicious lime, ale and basil sorbet.</TE>
<TE>   Hadfield also produces malt vinegars, including a French mint that
is a killer on lamb dishes. But his first love is beer. "The cool
thing about beer over wine," Hadfield says, "is that you can get malt
anywhere in the world and replicate all kinds of beer from anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Putting a new spin on the term B&amp;B--beer and breakfast--Spinnakers
has added five harbor-view garden suites behind the brew pub, and the
rooms are furnished in contemporary and Asian styles. It also has
rooms in a beautifully restored 1884 guest house next door. All of
Spinnakers' rooms have whirlpool tubs and wood-burning fireplaces,
and the room rates include breakfast in the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   What is Hadfield's recommendation for a breakfast brew? His
Tsarist Stout.</TE>
<TE>   I walked back over the bridge along the harbor front for 10
minutes until I reached the Russian submarine, next door to Stop 2 on
my ale trail. A black whale of Cold War power turned into a tourist
trap, the Russian Cobra squats incongruously alongside the umbrellas
and terrace tables of the stylish Harbour Canoe Club restaurant and
brew pub.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not ours; we have nothing to do with it," the seemingly
embarrassed hostess said of the submarine.</TE>
<TE>   The Harbour Canoe Club is housed in the cavernous former City
Lights hydroelectric building, on Victoria's waterfront and slightly
off the beaten track. It's relatively new among the city's brew pubs,
but its transformation from an industrial site into a brew pub in
1998 has been handled well. The interior of the 1895 warehouse is
airy but cozy despite its size. Large skylights brighten the hardwood
floors, and blond wood furnishings and red brick walls are covered
with canvases from the Victoria College of Art.</TE>
<TE>   Brew master Sean Hoyne produces five unfiltered, naturally
carbonated beers--including a seasonal one--in large, shiny tanks
above and behind the bar, where they are drawn with canoe
paddle-shaped handles.</TE>
<TE>   I took a seat at a high, round table in the lofty pub and ordered
the "Beer Fleet," a set of five 5-ounce tasters, which I sipped while
watching marina traffic outside the picture windows.</TE>
<TE>   Among the samples were a light lager, ESB (Extra Special Bitter, a
rich, hoppy ale), the Canoe Club's regular ale and a smooth sweeter
brown ale. But it was the seasonal and slightly cloudy Hefeweizen
that won my best brew award here.</TE>
<TE>   Here too beer is featured in the cooking, but I was too stuffed on
fish and chips to try anything. The extensive snack menu includes
focaccia made with the Canoe Club's Boardwalk Brown Ale and steamed
mussels deglazed with Davey Jones Lager. For lunch and dinner, more
expansive menus are heavy on seafood, and all the dishes come with
suggestions for a beer chaser.</TE>
<TE>   My third stop was just down the road from the Canoe Club. Swans
Suite Hotel and Buckerfield's Brewery is in an elegant 1913 building
that was transformed from a warehouse into the city's first
beer-and-breakfast establishment in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel has 29 suites, each different. The massive wood beams
and pillars that once supported rail-car loads of grain add a
loft-like look to the rooms, which are complemented with Canadian art
from the collection of Swans' former owner, Michael Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The public house on Swans' main floor is warm and spacious, a
comfortable British-pub-style setting in which to sample
Buckerfield's seven Bavarian, Canadian and British-style ales and
lagers.</TE>
<TE>   As at all the brew pubs, the staff is knowledgeable about the
beers. Name a beer you like, and the staff will suggest one of
Buckerfield's to suit you.</TE>
<TE>   The brews are hand-pulled from behind an elegant dark-wood-paneled
bar amid high walls adorned with West Coast native art from Williams'
collection.</TE>
<TE>   Like all of Victoria's brew masters, Swans' Chris Johnson uses
only imported specialty malts and yeast and adheres to the German
Purity Law of 1516, which stipulates that only malt, hops, yeast and
water can be used in the brewing process. The one exception is the
creamy SOS--Swan's Oatmeal Stout--which, of course, is made with
oats.</TE>
<TE>   Another of my favorites is Swans' Riley's Scotch Ale, a
full-bodied drop brewed in the "wee-heavy" style that brings it up to
8% alcohol instead of the usual Canadian beer content of 5%. Johnson
also brews a barley wine that ages for a full year.</TE>
<TE>   My final stop was the city's newest brew pub, less than five
minutes' walk from Swans. Hugo's Grill and Brew- house is a popular
spot where six taps usher forth Saskatchewan grains and Czech hops
carefully blended into blond ale, pale ale, porter and Pilsener.</TE>
<TE>   I took a seat at the long wood bar set to one side of the
steakhouse-like grill restaurant, which was filling up with a young,
lively crowd of office workers from surrounding businesses.</TE>
<TE>   A regular sitting beside me recommended that I try the Super G
Ginseng Cream Ale, an unusual brew with a hint of ginger that became
my favorite at this pub.</TE>
<TE>   By this time I needed sustenance, not another beer, I reasoned
with myself. So I compromised by ordering food made with beer--a
delicious bowl of mussels poached in Super G with chorizo sauce,
shallots and garlic.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was time for a nap.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Backpackers and independent adventurers will find new hop-on, hop-off
budget bus services operating this year in the U.S. and New Zealand.</LD>
<LD>   Starting in mid-May, Backpacker Bus, www.backpackerbus.com, will
provide guided transportation in 14-passenger vans in California and
the Southwest, stopping at hostels twice a week.</LD>
<LD>   The service will be operated by Grayson McNeill, owner of the
Adventure Hostel, a ski and snowboard lodge in Big Bear Lake that
offers private rooms and dormitory beds from $20 (including separate
female-only rooms).</LD>
<TE>   Routes will start from Big Bear Lake. The three-leg desert and
Grand Canyon loop will take at least two days and costs $35 for each
leg or $95 for all three. The bus will travel from Big Bear Lake to
Las Vegas; Las Vegas to Flagstaff, Ariz., and the Grand Canyon; and
Flagstaff back to Big Bear Lake.</TE>
<TE>   The three-leg southern loop costs $20 for each leg, or $55 for the
whole route. The route will be from Big Bear Lake to Los Angeles, Los
Angeles to San Diego, and San Diego back to Big Bear Lake.</TE>
<TE>   The four-leg San Francisco, Yosemite and California Coast Highway
loop costs $39 per leg or $139 for four. The route will be Big Bear
Lake to Yosemite Bug Lodge, Yosemite to Monterey, Monterey to Santa
Barbara, and Santa Barbara to Los Angeles and Big Bear Lake.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, contact Adventure Hostel, P.O. Box 1951, 527
Knickerbocker, Big Bear Lake, CA 92315-1951; (888) 464-6460 or (909)
866-8900, www.adventure hostel.com.</TE>
<TE>   The concept of the hop-on, hop-off bus became popular 14 years ago
with a New Zealand company called KIWI Experience. This winter one of
the original owners of KIWI Experience, Neil Geddes, returned to New
Zealand to introduce the Stray Travel Network, a service he developed
for backpackers in Britain and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Stray New Zealand offers two types of travel passes for its
31-seat passenger buses. Adventure passes include food, accommodation
and transportation over a set route, with the option of getting off
only at "break points." Rooms are shared by up to four travelers, but
you can upgrade to a twin or double room for $4 to $5 more per night.
If you're not tied to a schedule, the flexi-pass, which does not
include meals or accommodations, enables you to hop on and off
wherever you like over the route. Passes are valid for 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   Stray will operate year-round. For more information, contact Stray

<DH>Ethan Hawke's having some year: a new son, a new novel, a
brush with Oscar and his feature directing bow.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Congratulations to everyone who was born on Nov. 6. As birthdays go,
it's certainly turning out to be a red-letter one, at least for Ethan
Hawke. This year, the stars have been unusually generous to Hawke, so
shouldn't his fellow Scorpios be enjoying a mach 2 ride as well?</LD>
<LD>   "It's the kind of year that makes me believe in astrology," Hawke
says, and then he ticks off the heavens' economy pack of good
fortune, a string of important firsts and a couple of seconds not to
be sneezed at. Roan, his first son and second child with wife Uma
Thurman, made his debut on the planet two weeks into the new year.
"Training Day" earned him his first Oscar nomination (for best
supporting actor, holding his own against best actor winner Denzel
Washington) as well as a reported $12-million paycheck, bolstering
his faltering relationship with Hollywood and putting him on
everyone's call-back list. His second novel, "Ash Wednesday," about a
pregnant woman who returns home to Texas with her boyfriend in
pursuit, will be published by Knopf in July. And "Chelsea Walls," his
maiden voyage as a feature film director, will be released by Lions
Gate on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, yes. For fun, he plays piano, violin and trumpet.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe that all the arts are very much different exercises,
but it's all for the same purpose," Hawke says. "My life has been
dedicated to the arts."</TE>
<TE>   Hawke's public image is mainly that of a stand-up guy who hit the
big screen at 13 in Joe Dante's "Explorers" and went on to acclaim a
mere four years later in 1989's "Dead Poets Society." But for most of
his adult life, Hawke has also been walking the walk of a Renaissance
man--or dilettante, depending on which beholder you ask. Regardless,
it's hard to quibble over the sheer force of his creative energy.</TE>
<TE>   As his "Great Expectations" co-star Gwyneth Paltrow told Time Out
New York a few years ago, "He's the only one of my young artist
friends who says, 'You know, I want to start a theater company,
direct a video and go to Paris and write a novel. I want to do Sam
Shepard in Chicago'--and he does every one of those things."</TE>
<TE>   For a guy who's already master of his universe at the tender age
of 31, Hawke looks very much like he's, well, the tender age of 31.
Media aesthetes may periodically groom him for the screen or book
jacket, but sooner or later that scrubby goatee keeps resurfacing.
There it is as he slouches in a rattan chair in the courtyard of the
Chateau Marmont. Dressed in a sweatshirt and baggy pants, Hawke is
polishing off a somehow unsurprising stream of cigarettes and coffee.</TE>
<TE>   The Gen-X diet or, at the very least, fuel for final exams? Hawke
would be horrified at the thought. Films like "Reality Bites" (1994)
and "Before Sunrise" (1995) may have made him the poster boy for
scruffy slackerdom, but he's nothing like the aimless drifters he's
portrayed. "That Gen-X stuff used to bug me when I was younger," he
says. "It was just a label for a time period. I don't know that Gen X
has any kind of identity outside a group of people coming of age in
the '90s."</TE>
<TE>   Artists interest Hawke far more than slackers, and in bohemia,
which artists have always ruled, an eccentric New York City hostelry
known as the Chelsea Hotel may very well be its Buckingham Palace. It
follows that the legendary Chelsea is the star of the New York-based
actor's first feature film as a director. With an ensemble cast of
30, "Chelsea Walls" portrays a day in the life of five alienated
artists who reside within.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chelsea holds a lot of mythos for people who romanticize
bohemian life," Hawke says, lighting a cigarette. "The Chelsea Hotel
is like Notre Dame, so I've always been intrigued by it. If you're a
young kid and you walk by the Chelsea Hotel, you feel like you're
walking by all these ghosts. That hotel has been home to so many
creative movements from the Beats to Warhol and his crowd and the
punks, plus you've got Thomas Wolfe, so you have the whole Lost
Generation passing through there. Arthur Miller, Marilyn Monroe
fighting in the lobby.</TE>
<TE>   "It was built as a home for artists and it really has been that,
largely due to the credit of Stanley Bard, who owns the place. His
father owned the place before him, and he's kept the spirit intact.
So it just always held mystique for me. And this woman [Nicole
Burdette] wrote a beautiful piece that I thought had captured the
spirit of it, and I thought it would make a wonderful film."</TE>
<TE>   Hawke's first stab at movie directing was also shot at the
Chelsea. Between acting jobs in 1993, he made a short film about a
honeymooning couple called "Straight to One," which screened at
Sundance. (The next year he directed the music video "Stay" for
onetime next-door neighbor Lisa Loeb.) Mutual friends decided he
should meet Burdette, a young playwright who'd written a play about
life at the Chelsea inspired by former hotel resident Dylan Thomas'
"Under Milk Wood." But filming didn't begin until 1999, when InDiGent
Films bankrolled the $250,000 project as part of an experimental
program aimed at producing digital films for IFC and Bravo.</TE>
<TE>   "Chelsea Walls" breaks numerous rules of Hollywood filmmaking, yet
it uses Hollywood people to do it. For a movie that Hawke boasts
isn't destined for "the malls of America," he recruited a number of
marquee names, among them his wife, Kris Kristofferson, Natasha
Richardson, Tuesday Weld and Vincent D'Onofrio.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the actors are in the family Rolodex, such as Hawke's
oldest friend, Robert Sean Leonard, whom he met screen testing for
"Dead Poets Society." As for '60s and '70s stars Weld and
Kristofferson, Hawke went after them in hot pursuit. "I wrote Kris a
note saying I wanted to make this movie and unfortunately there was
only one person who could play the part and sadly, it was him," Hawke
says, recalling his pitch: "'You see my dilemma. You have to do this
movie, so please don't turn it down without calling me.' And then he
called me. It's hard to get a guy who's really successful, who has a
family, to really want to work for free. But he fell in love with the
project."</TE>
<TE>   Kristofferson was intrigued by the chance to re-create life at the
Chelsea, where he stayed when he played the Bitter End in the '70s,
and he felt he understood the character, a writer torn between his
wife, his mistress and bottles brimming with alcohol and bad
memories. But as Kristofferson's week on the set came to a close, he
also found that working with the first-time director was frankly a
relief.</TE>
<TE>   "I really came to respect his intelligence and his dedication to
his work," Kristofferson says. "He's a gifted writer, he's a creative
person and I felt that his passion for what he's doing rubbed off on
me. It's interesting doing work where you're thinking and not playing
somebody who's just running after vampires," as Kristofferson did in
"Blade II." "And it was nice working with people who are committed to
working on something that isn't going to make a lot of money. But I'm
surprised that it's even opening, because anything that's any good
that I'm associated with doesn't see the light of day."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly one feature of "Chelsea Walls" that might give mall
theater-bookers pause is its disregard for conventional plot. The
characters' meandering days and stories meet, but only in parallel as
they pass each other in the halls. They're viewed in filmy, poetic
sequences, sometimes from odd angles, through the window of a hallway
door, say, or in relentlessly intimate close-ups.</TE>
<TE>   "I would always joke when we were making the movie that the great
lie that movies and books tell us is that your life happens in some
kind of narrative sense," Hawke says. "It doesn't. We all feel like
our lives are endlessly boring because they don't work in this kind
of beginning, middle and end way that we always get told in stories.
So the movie is just a collage of moments and trying to paint a
picture of a collective rather than an individual story."</TE>
<TE>   With "Chelsea Walls," Hawke fractures time in another way. If
other films have identified him as someone surfing the zeitgeist,
here he's created a world that can't be linked to any particular
moment. Hawke says that wasn't a deliberate attempt to dissociate
himself from his former persona.</TE>
<TE>   "That stuff doesn't make it onto my radar," he says. "What excited
me about the hotel is that when you're there you can't really tell if
it's 1960 or 1990, and if you spend a lot of time there, you start to
lose track of time. So in weaving these stories together, I had the
hope and belief that in the course of one day, there was the feeling
that simultaneously all these people were living in different
decades."</TE>
<TE>   The idea is that the Kristofferson and Thurman story lines are
really taking place in the '60s and '70s, while the '80s are the era
of Rosario Dawson's character, a poet like Thurman's who loves the
wrong man. Leonard and Steve Zahn are Minnesota musicians who've just
come to town in the '90s. The layering of time is extremely subtle,
perhaps undetectable, although Hawke leaves bread crumbs for his
intrepid audience by shooting each scene using film techniques
identified with its particular decade.</TE>
<TE>   The '90s section, for example was shot with hand-held cameras and
available light, alluding to the austere films of Dogma directors.
For the '80s, the filmmakers used Steadicam for long, smooth shots
that encircle the action. "The '70s was all kind of gold and
hippie-ish," Hawke says. "Uma's room was all hippied out and
Kristofferson's was devoid of any primary colors."</TE>
<TE>   But in any decade, the denizens are bound to be maddeningly
narcissistic, unable to truly connect with those around them. For all
of Hawke's passion for the artist's way, his paean to it sounds a
fairly harsh note.</TE>
<TE>   "By making a movie about it, you romanticize it a little bit right
off the bat, but I try to paint an honest portrait of it," he says.
"What I love about the movie and what has always appealed to me about
creative people is that these people are desperate to be heard, but
they don't listen very well. They're filled with self-indulgence. A
lot of people are, and artists are sometimes the worst breed. But it
always makes me laugh, a guy dedicating his life to communicate this
book and write his feelings out, but he just can't register anyone
else's pathos.</TE>
<TE>   "And it's not just artists who are like that. I felt like you can
extend that out to all of humanity, in that the hotel is a great kind
of metaphor for a house where all these people are living so close
together, and they're all so lonely. They're sitting there crying
about how much they want to be understood, and they don't invest a
second in trying to understand somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Linklater, who has directed Hawke in four films, including
last year's "Tape," says the actor's directing debut shows integrity.
"You say a lot about yourself in the first thing you do as a
director," says Linklater, who makes a cameo appearance. "It takes
such an enormous effort to make any film, but especially your first.
You bring a lifetime of ideas to it, and Ethan could have done a more
commercial film. But I'm not at all surprised that he made this
personal, small, somewhat experimental art film that really
concentrates on these performances and people and poetic collage and
small moments and gestures. I think it's a wonderful movie."</TE>
<TE>   Hawke's first renaissance role model was his stepfather, Patrick
Powers, who helped raise him in New Jersey after his teenage Texas
parents divorced when he was 3. "He's a real jack of all trades,"
Hawke says of Powers. "He's a drummer and a guitar player and a piano
player and a painter and a sculptor and a deeply religious man. He
had that whole aesthetic that the arts are all the same thing. It's
just that I'm going to use my drums to try to do it or I'm going to
try to do it with watercolor or performance. And I've always bought
that."</TE>
<TE>   Hawke dropped out of two colleges, seeking his education instead
on the job and on the stage. Film parts came steadily after "Dead
Poets," but between films he turned to the theater to hone his skills
and get directing experience. In 1993, he appeared on Broadway in
Chekhov's "The Seagull." He also co-founded a New York theater
company called Malaparte. "I was 21 when I came up with the name, but
there was a book that was published unbound, and the idea was that
you could read it in any order. It doesn't matter what happens but
how it happens, which actually ends up being very much the spirit of
'Chelsea Walls.'"</TE>
<TE>   The film reunites a lot of Malaparte people who've dispersed as
their careers and new families have pulled them away, among them,
Leonard, Zahn, Frank Whaley and Burdette, whose work was staged by
the company. "When I got married and started my own family, the thing
I lost was the theater company," Hawke says. "And so this is a way to
regroup with those people and try to push the work we were doing in
the theater into film."</TE>
<TE>   He also put his intimate knowledge of his film family to work. "I
felt like I had the opportunity to give all of them a chance to do
something they don't normally do. I know what an incredible musician
Bob Leonard is, so if I've got a part for a musician, I'm going to
let Bob do it. Uma always gets asked to play these real uber women,
and it was great to give her a chance to play an everyday human being
rather than an ice princess or the queen of Nosferatu's revenge."</TE>
<TE>   Hawke came to the project after a disappointing run acting in
big-budget productions in the late '90s. Films like "Gattaca" (1997),
"Great Expectations" (1998) and "Snow Falling on Cedars" (1999)
saddled his career with a pall of box-office anemia, although
"Gattaca" offered the redeeming social value of hooking him up with
Thurman. In retrospect, Hawke thinks the best thing he could have
done to turn on his acting pilot light was to turn to directing.</TE>
<TE>   "It really turned me back on to acting," he says. "It was so much
fun working with all these actors that I got reinvigorated about
acting. It was great. After I finished shooting, I went and shot
'Training Day.'"</TE>
<TE>   Hawke credits his "Training Day" co-star Washington with further
raising the bar, helping him snag an Oscar nomination. "The most
obvious comparison is, if you play basketball with somebody who's
much better than you, you play a lot better. I've never worked with
somebody who has that level of confidence. I liken it to most people
when they're a senior in high school. You walk around high school,
you feel confident, you do whatever you want. Denzel gets to operate
to the world as though he's a senior in high school. He's got his act
together, and he was really good to me."</TE>
<TE>   These days, Hawke's eyes may be heavy-lidded, but it's not from
losing sleep over his medusa-like career path. It's more likely to be
because Roan is a morning person, if you consider dawn morning.
Thurman had been a full-time mom while Hawke was on the job, but
after a hiatus of a couple of years, she recently returned to work on
the L.A. set of Quentin Tarantino's long-awaited new film. In "Kill
Bill," she plays a woman who deals with men who've done her wrong by
killing them.</TE>
<TE>   All things considered, Hawke thinks this might be a good time for
intermission. "I'm all played out," he says. "I'm at a real natural
breakpoint anyway. I feel like one chapter is ending and a new one is
beginning. I've made a movie--it's something I've always dreamed
about doing. I got this book off my chest and my acting career is in
a place it's never been before. So," he says, rising from his chair
to take his family to Santa Barbara for a quiet weekend, "I'm going
to proceed with caution."</TE>

<HD>Musharraf Risks All With Needless Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAHEEN SEHBAI</AU>
<BD>Shaheen Sehbai recently resigned under government
pressure as editor of The News, a leading English-language Pakistani
newspaper.</BD>
<DL>GREAT FALLS, Va.</DL>
<LD>Pakistan's fourth military dictator, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has made
a critical decision in his 30-month tenure: to jump into the murky,
treacherous waters of Pakistani politics. That this decision was
unnecessary, irrational and not in the country's best interest is now
irrelevant. By announcing that he will seek a five-year presidential
term in a referendum later this month, Musharraf has not just put his
head on the line, he has created a climate of uncertainty that should
alarm the United States and its international allies.</LD>
<LD>   The timing seems, at first, puzzling. While the U.S. and others
have urged Musharraf to restore civilian democracy, in recent months
this has become a more long-term goal. Musharraf has been embraced by
world leaders and welcomed in major world capitals. Pakistan has been
quietly removed from sanction lists, and the flow of international
aid has increased dramatically. Domestically, a pliant judiciary and
press have provided tacit support for Musharraf's policies. And he
had begun taking real steps toward something no one else could have
even attempted: banning extremist religious organizations, curbing
terror-spewing religious schools known as madrasas, purging (though
half-heartedly) rogue intelligence networks and supporting a U.S.-led
war against the Taliban.</LD>
<TE>   So what has pushed him into the muddy world of politics? He is
certainly ambitious. And in recent months he has become
overconfident, intoxicated with power and his newfound respectability
abroad. Finally, though, his decision came not so much because of
what he wants for himself now, but rather with the role he wants to
play on a much larger stage in October, when Pakistan will hold
parliamentary elections. Musharraf is looking for a mandate today
that will guarantee his handpicked candidates an advantage in those
elections. He acknowledges he is taking a huge risk, but argues that
as a military man he is not afraid to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that the risk is not simply Musharraf's--it is
Pakistan's. If he doesn't get a convincing majority in an honest and
open vote later this month, he faces a threat from the religious
fundamentalists he has been trying to stifle as well as from an
increasingly unruly military, which would view his defeat as an
invitation to make trouble. Even a weak vote of support in a
genuinely free and fair referendum would shake his political edifice.
And a rigged vote would compromise his credentials abroad and, more
importantly, weaken his grip on the core of his ruling junta, which
is already pushing for the removal of Musharraf as chief of the army.
Pakistan's major political parties have spoken out against holding a
referendum.</TE>
<TE>   The multi-pronged and difficult war against international
terrorism demands a Pakistani leader committed to identifying and
pursuing the rogue armies of terrorists inside and outside Pakistan.
Initially, Musharraf rose to the occasion, making strong and
unequivocal statements and demonstrating his willingness to act. Not
anymore. Since his thoughts have turned to the referendum, he has
begun making compromises. He has released hundreds of arrested
Taliban fighters and their Pakistani religious mentors. He has
refused to hand Ahmad Saeed Omar Sheikh, the prime suspect in
American journalist Daniel Pearl's murder. He is now breaking bread
with the same corrupt politicians against whom he once waged a
sincere accountability campaign. Lastly, he is cracking down on
Pakistan's tiny but independent print media while blatantly using the
tightly controlled electronic media for his aggressive political
campaigning. In short, from an honest military strongman on solid
moral ground, Musharraf has become a double-speaking
dictator-politician, making fervent, broadly emotional and mostly
hollow appeals for public support.</TE>
<TE>   Washington should be very afraid. The U.S. is pumping hundreds of
millions of taxpayer dollars into Pakistan. It was perhaps wrong in
the first place for Washington to count so much on one man. Now, in a
time of such uncertainty, it becomes crucial that the U.S. reach out
to other potential leaders, developing direct rapport with top
military generals and supporting relatively clean and popular
politicians. The U.S. should encourage the judiciary to act
independently, particularly on issues involving popular but exiled
political leaders. And the U.S. should support a vigorous free press.</TE>
<TE>   If Musharraf is choosing now to be a politician, he must be
pressured to level the playing field for other Pakistani politicians
before the October elections. As Pakistan has witnessed repeatedly,
attempts to use brute military and state force to further the
half-baked political agendas of military dictators have always pushed
the country into instability and chaos. And in today's climate, such
a situation would serve the ends of terrorists and rogue armies.</TE>
<TE>   The best option for the West would be to ask Musharraf not to
demolish himself so soon for so little. He should call off the
referendum now. He has been given another three years of legitimate
rule by the Supreme Court, and he could seek, and likely receive, a
two-year extension. That would give Musharraf time to oversee free
and fair parliamentary elections as scheduled and to grant the
judiciary the independence and responsibility to decide corruption
cases against politicians and generals. It would give him time to
find a new army chief and give up that part of his job in order to
distance the military from politics. Once things are stable,
Musharraf should resign as president and seek election through
constitutional means.</TE>

<HD>Indians Rally for 10th Consecutive Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Matt Lawton stepped to the plate in the eighth inning, Jacobs
Field pulsated and the pounding in his ears told him all he needed to
know.</LD>
<LD>   The Cleveland Indians were coming back.</LD>
<LD>   "When that drum started beating out there," Lawton, one of the
newest Indians said, shaking his head. "As an opposing player, you
almost grow to accept it."</LD>
<TE>   Down by five runs in the eighth, the Indians rallied for their
10th consecutive victory and most improbable one yet in 2002 on
Saturday, 8-7 over the Kansas City Royals at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland scored five runs--three on Lawton's homer--to tie it at
7-7 in the eighth, and then won it with one out in the bottom of the
ninth when pinch-runner Einar Diaz scored on Jason Grimsley's wild
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   At 11-1, the Indians have baseball's best record and are off to
their best start since opening the 1966 season 14-1.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing we hadn't done was have a big comeback," said
reliever Paul Shuey (1-0), who has seen the Indians rally to win 93
times in their last at-bat in Jacobs Field since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "People will be watching on ESPN tonight and it will be in the
back of their minds that we can come back."</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland also had a 10-game winning streak last season from April
28-May 9.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 7, New York 6--Shea Hillenbrand hit a go-ahead homer off
Mariano Rivera as the Red Sox rallied for four runs in the eighth
inning at Boston and sent the Yankees to their fourth consecutive
loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees scored four in the first against struggling Boston ace
Pedro Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   David Wells left with a 6-3 lead after giving up Johnny Damon's
one-out double in the eighth, and neither Ramiro Mendoza nor Rivera
(0-1) could end the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 7, Detroit 3--The Tigers lost their 10th in a row--their
worst start in 82 years--as Torii Hunter went three for three with
three RBIs to lead the Twins at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers are the lone winless team in the majors and are off to
their worst start since going 0-13 in 1920.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Tampa Bay 4--Carlos Delgado hit a two-run homer and
doubled at St. Petersburg, Fla., as the Blue Jays won their fourth in
a row.</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger Luke Prokopec (1-1) earned his first AL victory,
giving up one run and seven hits over five innings.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 9, Texas 4--Mike Cameron homered twice and the Mariners
defeated the Rangers for their sixth consecutive victory--all on the
road.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron's two-run homer started a four-run outburst in the sixth
that put Seattle ahead to stay. He had a solo shot, his fourth of the
season, in the ninth for his sixth career two-homer game.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 4, Baltimore 3--Paul Konerko hit a tiebreaking single in
the eighth inning after a key error by Oriole second baseman Melvin
Mora as the White Sox rallied to win at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Mariner designated hitter Edgar Martinez had surgery to
remove a ruptured hamstring tendon and is expected to be out more
than a month. The procedure of removing the tendon is still
relatively new, which makes it difficult to determine the recovery
time. Mariner Manager Lou Piniella said the 39-year-old Martinez
would be out at least four to six weeks, but that may be an
optimistic estimate.... Minnesota Twin second baseman Luis Rivas has
a fractured left forearm and will probably miss two to four more
weeks. Rivas hasn't played since being hit by a pitch from Kansas
City's Dan Reichert on April 3.</TE>

<HD>Anderson Starts Fireworks</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fireworks are launched at Edison Field during the national anthem and
after Angel home runs, but until Saturday night young children had
been spared the ear-numbing trauma during Angel games this season.</LD>
<LD>   Garret Anderson finally gave the pyrotechnicians a chance to pull
the trigger after play began when he hit a booming first-inning,
two-run homer to right against Oakland starter Erik Hiljus in the
Angels' 7-2 loss Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   The homer ended an 0-for-20 drought for Anderson that dated to
April 7. He also had a single in the sixth inning.</LD>
<TE>   Anderson's homer was the first by an Angel player other than third
baseman Troy Glaus, who hit three in two games at Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Before Anderson's shot, the Angels had played eight home games
without a home run, their longest drought since Sept. 12-Oct. 4,
1991. Their three homers for the season previously tied them with
Kansas City for last in the American League.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said he was not worried about the
power outage.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were a team full of rookies that were untested in the major
leagues and they were all having the difficulty we're seeing with
some guys getting on track, it would be very important for these guys
to step up and establish themselves," Scioscia said. "But we're
dealing with guys who have been through some tough times before and
have always come out of it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia shuffled the lineup Saturday and is likely to do the same
again today to give some of his regulars a day off.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff DaVanon made his first start, playing right field in place of
Tim Salmon, who was batting .171. Catcher Jorge Fabregas made his
third start.</TE>
<TE>   DaVanon and Fabregas each went hitless, DaVanon in four at-bats
and Fabregas in three Saturday. Salmon pinch-hit for Brad Fullmer in
the sixth with two men on, but struck out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Closer Troy Percival, on the 15-day disabled list since April 3
because of a strained muscle in his rib cage, will throw in the
bullpen today and could make a rehabilitation start on Tuesday as he
moves toward becoming activated Friday or Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Percival said he threw with 85% effort during a bullpen session
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be pretty optimistic when they say four to six weeks
and you're feeling pretty good at two weeks," he said.</TE>

<HD>An Unconditioned Response?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Who knows?" replied Lou Piniella, knowing there is no real answer.</LD>
<LD>   The Seattle Mariners' manager was sitting in his clubhouse office
at Edison Field on a midweek afternoon, thinking about what once was,
who Ken Griffey Jr. once was. He said he is pulling for his former
center fielder to regain his incomparable form but wonders if the
injuries that have impaired Griffey's talent--and dimmed his
infectious persona--in each of the last two years might have been
avoided if Griffey had been more conscientious about his conditioning
in those Seattle years when he was Roy Hobbs come to life.</LD>
<LD>   In those years, of course, the hard, synthetic surface of the
Kingdome was Griffey's personal trampoline, and the black leather
lounge chair that sat in front of his locker seemed to symbolize his
approach to conditioning.</LD>
<TE>   Weightlifting? Stretching?</TE>
<TE>   Junior got his exercise playing the game as no one else played it,
even as Piniella tried to tell him that he needed to work at his
conditioning, if only to compensate for the pounding he absorbed on
that hard surface.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him he might pay for it as he got older, but it all came
so natural to him that he probably didn't see the need," Piniella
said. "I told him that he needed to work harder as he got older, but
it's hard to convince a young man who is at the top of his game and
on top of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Junior played every day, played hard, played to win. He could
have [conditioned] as hard as possible with us and suffered the same
fate that he has. At the same time, by preparing a little better, he
might have remained as healthy and productive. He was the best player
in the game, and I'd like nothing more than to see him get totally
healthy again and put together the numbers he did when he was with
us. I think he's fully capable, and I think he will."</TE>
<TE>   It has been only three years since Griffey ignored Thomas Wolfe
and forged his return to the hometown Cincinnati Reds, but what has
happened to that once indelible image?</TE>
<TE>   Who can recall the magical vision of an irrepressible Griffey, his
cap turned backward, jauntily bouncing around the batting cage,
joking with his Seattle teammates--and the opposition?</TE>
<TE>   Do we remember the dazzling talent that inspired all those
All-Star votes, that prompted Henry Aaron to predict Griffey was the
hitter most likely to break Aaron's home run record of 755, and that
in 1999 landed Griffey on an All-Century team so rich in talent that
Barry Bonds wasn't even first string.</TE>
<TE>   Griffey is 32 now, and it is hard to reconstruct that once-vivid
portrait, hard to remember when that talent and laugh last lit up a
TV screen or magazine cover.</TE>
<TE>   He was criticized by former Red teammates in the spring, accused
of being a divisive clubhouse influence and failing to provide
leadership, and his pursuit of Aaron's record has been slowed--if not
permanently damaged--by the injuries.</TE>
<TE>   He missed almost two months last season because of a torn
hamstring and now is out at least three weeks because of a partially
torn tendon and a dislocated right knee.</TE>
<TE>   There have even been reports that Griffey is so unhappy at home,
friends have been trying to influence a trade that would return him
to the Mariners, a scenario strongly denied by his lawyer and both
teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We have three plans for Junior," Cincinnati General Manager Jim
Bowden said. "One is to finish his career with the Reds, two is to
surpass Henry Aaron and three is to get a World Series ring."</TE>
<TE>   All of that, of course, hinges on the Reds' ability to get Griffey
into the lineup and keep him there over the final six years of his
contract.</TE>
<TE>   It's not impossible, perhaps, but Bowden concedes that Griffey
undoubtedly came to the Reds on a weakened foundation, his knees and
hamstrings affected by all those years on the artificial surface.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't comment because I wasn't there to observe what he did or
didn't do from a conditioning standpoint," Bowden said. "All I can
tell you is that I've never been a fan of AstroTurf, I'm glad we're
on grass now, and since he's been here he's worked on his
conditioning very hard and very diligently on a daily basis."</TE>
<TE>   There may be differing opinions about that, as there are about
Griffey's clubhouse role, but the largest issue for the Reds concerns
his ability to perform at or close to his previous peaks.</TE>
<TE>   The home run pursuit is one measure of how far and fast the
younger Griffey had ascended.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having spent parts of four seasons on the disabled list
with injuries suffered most often through his exuberant play--a
broken wrist in 1995 limited him to 72 games--Griffey joined the Reds
in 2000 with 398 home runs. He was 30, had hit 48 or more homers for
five consecutive seasons, and would pass Aaron before turning 39 by
averaging 40 a year, a realistic pace he met on the nose in his first
season with the Reds.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, however, never totally sound because of the hamstring,
he hit only 22 homers, his lowest total since 1995. Now, sidelined
again, he'll need time to regain his rhythm and stroke, even if the
injury allows him to play after only three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Now too, Bonds has moved into Aaron's shadow as Griffey struggles
on those same slippery rungs that knocked Mark McGwire and others off
the ladder.</TE>
<TE>   In Griffey's case, however, it is not just the pursuit of a record
that we miss.</TE>
<TE>   It is the joy and enthusiasm he displayed, that indelible image.</TE>
<TE>   If the perception began to change when he forced the Mariners to
trade him--and doesn't Seattle's recent success compound his
frustration?--the injuries have continued to sap his joy.</TE>
<TE>   As Griffey said in spring training, no one maintains a constant
smile when he's hurt and losing all the time.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, if he had absorbed what Piniella was trying to tell
him in another time and place, he might have avoided some of the
hurts and gone on smiling.</TE>

<HD>Tigers Put Baseball in Detroit's Background</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press commenting on the woeful
Tigers, who fired Manager Phil Garner and General Manager Randy Smith
when the team was 0-6 and were winless through the first 10 games:</LD>
<LD>   "Under Smith, they became the losingest team in baseball. Under
Garner, they went backward. The fans departed. They lost interest.
Detroit is now a hockey town, a football town. It is even becoming
slowly, once again, a basketball town.</LD>
<LD>   "But it's a baseball town in memory only. Fourteen seasons without
the playoffs will do that."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Tigers: "We need to play harder and better," team President
Dave Dombrowski said, "but a lot of people think this team is a
sleeping giant."</TE>
<TE>   Albom: "More sleeping than giant, Dave."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Tiger Woods won the Masters by a record 12 strokes in
1997. Who was runner-up?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Franchise savior: Brian Schmitz of the Orlando Sentinel,
commenting Friday on Jason Kidd's contribution to the New Jersey
Nets:</TE>
<TE>   "He is the odds-on favorite to win MVP, and it's this statistic
that separates him from the pack: 25 wins and counting.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the number of wins New Jersey has improved this season
since his arrival in a stunning off-season trade [with Phoenix]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grim appraisal: Dave D'Allesandro of the Newark (N.J.) Star-
Ledger:</TE>
<TE>   "Bad analogy of the year from [the Knicks'] Allen Houston, as
playoff elimination approached: 'It's like when you have a relative
that's really sick and you know they're going to die.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Masters hackers: Tsuneyuki Nakajima of Japan used 13 strokes on
the par-five 13th hole in 1978. Tom Weiskopf matched the 13 on the
par-three 12th hole in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oddity: Craig Wood shot an 88 in the first round of the 1936
Masters, then scored 67 in the second--a difference of 21 strokes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like what? Jason Williams of Memphis, on the possibility that the
Grizzlies might draft Jason Williams of Duke:</TE>
<TE>   "If they're going to pick him, they need to let me know. And then
they're going to have to do something with me when they do that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Comparable: Jim Caple of ESPN.com on the late Queen Mum: "Her
reign extended nearly as far back as Mike Morgan's rookie season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1967, Boston left-hander Bill Rohr,
making his major league debut, lost his bid for a no-hitter when
Elston Howard singled for the Yankees with two out in the ninth
inning of a 3-0 Red Sox victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Tom Kite.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Frank Fitzpatrick of the Philadelphia Inquirer
commenting irreverently on the Masters:</TE>
<TE>   "Wouldn't it be great to see John Daly win and then, during the
solemn presentation ceremony, pop open a Budweiser and burn a hole in
his green jacket with ashes from his Marlboro?</TE>
<TE>   "Wouldn't you give anything to hear a caddie say, 'Can someone
tell me why we have to dress like Good Humor men in these silly white
coveralls?'"</TE>

<HD>Olowokandi Gets Word</HD>
<DH>Basketball: He finally learns before Clippers' 101-98 loss
to 'Wolves that his $50,000 fine had been rescinded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about a failure to communicate.</LD>
<LD>   Clipper center Michael Olowokandi evidently was the last to know
the team had on Friday rescinded his $50,000 fine for speaking out
April 3 about his lack of a contract for next season and the toll he
believed it was having on his teammates' morale.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday, only 45 minutes before the Clippers played the Minnesota
Timberwolves at Staples Center, Olowokandi was still under the
impression that he would be docked $50,000, with the money going to a
charity of his choice.</LD>
<TE>   Olowokandi said he was considering donating it to Childrens
Hospital Los Angeles because "I've done some work with them in the
past." He said he also was thinking of the Make-A-Wish Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "The fine still stands," Olowokandi said before the Clippers'
101-98 loss against the Timberwolves. "I made a suggestion to Elgin
[Baylor, Clipper general manager] that I'd rather give the money to
charity. I'd rather give it to somebody who could make better use of
it."</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday night, after the team's loss to the Sacramento Kings,
Baylor entered the pressroom at Staples Center to inform reporters of
the same thing Olowokandi would tell them Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor contradicted an earlier statement made by a team spokesman
that the fine had been rescinded after an hour-long meeting between
Baylor and Olowokandi following the team's morning shoot-around.</TE>
<TE>   "The fine has been rescinded," said Joe Safety, Clipper vice
president of communications, when asked to set the record straight
Saturday. "Michael was under the mistaken impression the money was
going to charity. I'll go tell him right now."</TE>
<TE>   Matters were just as confused on the court to start Saturday's
game. The Clippers fell behind the Timberwolves, 11-1, less than
three minutes into the game en route to their 11th loss in their last
15 games.</TE>
<TE>   With games remaining Tuesday against the Memphis Grizzlies and
Wednesday against the Golden State Warriors, the best record the
Clippers (38-42) can achieve is 40-42. The Clippers were 31-51 last
season and 15-67 in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers had their moments Saturday, rallying into the lead by
halftime and staying close until the end. Minnesota's Kevin Garnett
put the Timberwolves ahead to stay, 99-98, with an open 10-foot jump
shot with 1:03 left.</TE>
<TE>   Garnett was open because Joe Smith picked off Clipper point guard
Jeff McInnis above the top of the key, sending him to the floor
clutching his head. McInnis would leave the game and the Clippers
would not score again.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson missed a short shot. Garnett missed at the
other end and, after two Clipper timeouts and one Minnesota timeout,
backup point guard Earl Boykins missed a jump shot on the left wing.</TE>
<TE>   Chauncey Billups made two free throws after the Clippers were
forced to foul him with 1.7 seconds to play to account for the 101-98
score.</TE>
<TE>   Garnett led the Timberwolves, who clinched fifth place in the
Western Conference, with 35 points, 10 rebounds and five assists.
Billups had 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Maggette had 24 points for the Clippers, making nine of 12
shots, and Quentin Richardson had 19 points on eight-for-14 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 99-98, the Clippers looked confused as the seconds
ticked off the clock. There was little movement on a play that was
designed for Richardson and Eric Piatkowski to be freed from their
defenders by screens.</TE>
<TE>   With no other options available, Boykins drifted to his left and
launched a jump shot that missed the mark.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a good shot," Boykins said. "I just missed it. Make the
shot, that was the play and I didn't make it."</TE>

<HD>Odom's Surgery Is Not an Issue</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the final analysis, the Clippers were not disappointed forward
Lamar Odom waited until last week to have surgery on his sprained
right wrist.</LD>
<LD>   Odom, who was injured Dec. 16 and put on the injured list Jan. 24
after trying to play through the pain, is expected to be sidelined
three months.</LD>
<LD>   "He thought there was a possibility that he could be back," Coach
Alvin Gentry said. "Only he knows his body. I don't know if it would
have made a difference if he had the surgery a week earlier."</LD>
<TE>   Odom should be ready by Sept. 1, Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll have a whole month before training camp starts," he said.
"When it comes time to play games, he'll have had six weeks to get
ready.... When you add Lamar back to the mix, it adds a ton of
versatility."</TE>
<TE>   Several Clippers, including Gentry, visited Odom after the surgery
and reported that he was in good spirits and looking forward to next
season.</TE>
<TE>   Odom played only 29 games in 2001-02.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry on the notion expressed recently by some observers that the
Clippers are better off without Odom:</TE>
<TE>   "I would say they're idiots. I would say they have no clue about
basketball. I would say they're the same people who were saying
Sacramento is better without Chris Webber."</TE>

<LD>Kevin Brown's elbow was in pain Saturday night, but his earned-run
average--as well as the entire rotation's ERA over the last eight
days--did not suffer, thanks to some superb Dodger defense against
the Padres.</LD>
<LD>   After Brown walked D'Angelo Jimenez and Mark Kotsay to open the
first inning, Phil Nevin hit a grounder up the middle that appeared
ticketed for center field.</LD>
<LD>   But shortstop Cesar Izturis made a spectacular diving stop and, on
his stomach, flipped to second baseman Mark Grudzielanek to start a
double play. Brown got Ryan Klesko to pop to first, ending the
inning.</LD>
<TE>   Ray Lankford walked and Deivi Cruz doubled to start the second
inning, putting runners on second and third, before Brown struck out
Ramon Vazquez. Brown exited during Tom Lampkin's at-bat, and Lampkin
walked on a Terry Mulholland pitch, but pitcher Brian Tollberg
bounced into a 4-6-3, inning-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   In the seven games before Saturday, Dodger starting pitchers went
5-0 with an 0.61 ERA, allowing three earned runs in 441/3 innings.</TE>

<HD>It's Been a Long, Rarely Smooth, Ride for Perez</HD>
<DH>Track and field: Triple jumper has found a home in Tucson
after unhappy stays in U.S. foster homes and being kicked off Cuba's
national team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>When triple jumper Yuliana Perez fled Cuba after being kicked off the
national track and field team, she chose to go to Tucson only because
she was born there.</LD>
<LD>   Just 18, she spoke no English and knew no one. Her mother had been
shot to death when she was 3. The father she didn't know was in a
Georgia prison.</LD>
<LD>   Back in Arizona and exhausted from a day's work as a waitress, she
climbed aboard the wrong city bus, and fell asleep. Had she boarded
the right bus that day two years ago, she might not be the rising
young American star she has become.</LD>
<TE>   But Yuliana Perez has a knack of turning bad circumstances into
good.</TE>
<TE>   When she awoke, she was alone, except for the bus driver. He spoke
Spanish, and she told him of her athletic past. He said he would talk
to his good friend, Mario Pena, an assistant track coach at Pima
Community College, to see if he could help her.</TE>
<TE>   "Man," Perez says, "I was born again."</TE>
<TE>   The name "Yuliana" dances off the tongue and matches a
cheerfulness and positive attitude that defy the reality she has
endured.</TE>
<TE>   Her father was among those sent from Cuba to the United States by
Fidel Castro two decades ago, a so-called humanitarian act that
actually was a way for the dictator to rid his country of a batch of
criminals and mental patients.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents settled briefly in Tucson, where she was born in 1981.
A short time later, they moved to Las Vegas. The father was arrested
and sent to prison, and Perez moved with her mother and two younger
brothers to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The circumstances of her mother's death are murky. It may have
been an accident, some sort of drive-by shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a long time ago and I'd really rather not talk about
it," Perez says. "I can't even remember her face."</TE>
<TE>   At 3, Perez was sent with her brothers to San Diego and put in the
care of a woman at a foster home.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God, that lady was bad," she recalls. "My brothers, they
both had problems wetting the bed, and she'd hit them. I had long,
nice hair and she went snip, snip, snip."</TE>
<TE>   Perez says she would sneak out of bed at night to get food for her
brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I got caught, and she hit me. I didn't care," she says.</TE>
<TE>   At 5, she was shipped to Cuba to be raised by her paternal
grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   After just one year there, her natural athletic ability caught the
attention of the country's coaches. She began running, high jumping
and throwing a softball, and she excelled at them all.</TE>
<TE>   "One day one of my friends goes, 'I've got something for you that
you might not be able to do,'" she says. "I laughed and said, 'You
know, I can do everything.'"</TE>
<TE>   At 14, she tried the triple jump.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, 'That was hard,'" she says, "I tried it again, and
then I told my coach, 'I would like to do that.' I kept working and
started getting good and good and good, and I liked it."</TE>
<TE>   A few months before she was to graduate from high school, she was
told she was being removed from the national team because she was
born in the United States and was considered a threat to defect.</TE>
<TE>   Her athletic career in Cuba was finished, and she was shattered.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, she was removed from school, too.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so hard for me to keep going, but I did," she says. "I
thought, 'There's got to be something better than this. I miss my
mother. I miss my school. I miss my sport. What am I supposed to do
now? I have to keep going.' That was when I decided to come to the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. section of the Swiss Embassy in Havana lent her money to
leave Cuba. After arriving in Tucson in February 2000, it took her
five months to finally get a job. To ease the stress, she began
running again.</TE>
<TE>   The bus driver was true to his word, and Pena brought Perez to
meet John Radspinner, Pima's head track coach.</TE>
<TE>   "She says she used to be a triple jumper," Radspinner remembers.
"We told her there's not much we can do, because at that point we
thought she was from Cuba, and there's just no way we can get someone
from Cuba on our team. But I told her this year she can just work out
with us if she wants, and she lit up. She was just so happy."</TE>
<TE>   He asked her what her best mark was. She told him 45 feet, 31/2
inches.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking, 'That ain't right,'" Radspinner says, "because we
have a pretty good history of triple jumpers and she's talking four
feet past our best ever."</TE>
<TE>   He went home, checked the Internet, and found Perez's mark was
just what she said it was. Still, Pima offers scholarships only to
Arizonans, and there was no thought of getting her on the college
team until one day when she and the coaches were talking in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "I think one of the coaches said, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could
put her on scholarship,'" Radspinner says. "I said, 'Nope, she is
from Cuba.' Then she said, 'Wait a minute. I was born in Tucson.'</TE>
<TE>   "The next day she brought me this old, yellow Scotch-taped birth
certificate all in Spanish from the Tucson Medical Center. That just
cleared everything."</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Perez won the national junior-college indoor and outdoor
championships, finished second in the U.S. outdoor championships, and
then took fourth in the World University Games in Beijing with a
personal-best 46 feet, 103/4 inches.</TE>
<TE>   After just a little practice, she also won the national junior
college long jump title.</TE>
<TE>   "With normal improvement I think she can be the best in the world
by the time she's 26," Radspinner says.</TE>
<TE>   Perez has never met her father. A U.S. writer who befriended her
in Cuba several years ago sent her a stack of documents last year
detailing her father's criminal history.</TE>
<TE>   "It was real bad," she says. "He used to steal with a gun in
stores, all that stuff. They don't want him here in America. I
haven't talked to him. I haven't seen him. I don't feel that I need
him, but I would like to ask him some questions."</TE>
<TE>   She has no desire to go back to Cuba, except to bring her younger
brothers to America.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no communication with them," she says. "They don't know if
I'm dead or alive. They love me so."</TE>
<TE>   Whenever she has needed someone, Tucson has provided.</TE>
<TE>   The Conquistadors, the service club that operates the Tucson Open
golf tournament, paid her way to international meets last year and
paid off the Swiss loan to clear the way for her to travel abroad. A
dentist repaired her teeth for free. She considers three women her
"new mothers"--one who took her into her home, one who runs an
investment company where she works part-time, and one who is her
academic advisor.</TE>
<TE>   "People love me. They treat me good. They help me out," she says.
"There are too many people that I can name that helped me. That is
something I am so proud of."</TE>
<TE>   She will need at least another year of schooling at Pima to
qualify for transfer to a four-year university. While she speaks
English well after just two years, studying in English is tough.
Overcoming difficulties, though, is her stock in trade.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes bad things happen, and I start crying and crying," she
says. "When I get tired of crying, I start thinking, 'Hell no, I'm
going to do what I can.' I think it's part of me, that attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "If you make a cake and don't like it, you make it again. I have
to do it. I'm a believer."</TE>

<HD>Ruiz Uses His Head as Galaxy Earns 1-1 Tie</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was someone else's turn but no one else turned up, so Carlos Ruiz
had to rescue the Galaxy yet again.</LD>
<LD>   The 22-year-old youngster from Guatemala City scored his fifth
goal in three Major League Soccer games Saturday night as Los Angeles
rallied to tie the Dallas Burn, 1-1 after overtime, in front of
14,127 at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   The city is slowly waking up to its newest star. When Ruiz rose
above a crowd of Dallas defenders to head the ball in off the
underside of the crossbar in the 84th minute, there were suddenly
plenty of blue and white Guatemalan flags waving in the stands.</LD>
<TE>   The Galaxy, one of only two unbeaten teams in MLS, has scored five
goals this season and Ruiz has every one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy that we got a goal at the end," Galaxy Coach Sigi
Schmid said. "I'm happy that Carlos scored again.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish somebody else would score once in a while, too, but I'm
happy that we finally have a goal scorer in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Cobi Jones and Simon Elliott helped create the goal, but Ruiz gets
all the credit for the finish.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was in a race down the left sideline with the Burn's Ryan
Suarez when Suarez tumbled to the turf. Referee Alex Prus gave him a
yellow card for diving and awarded the Galaxy a free kick.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott crossed the ball into a crowded penalty area and Ruiz, who
at 5-foot-9 is several inches shorter than three of Dallas' four
defenders, leaped to head the ball off the bar and down behind
goalkeeper Matt Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "He gets up very well," Schmid said. "He's a very dynamic player.
He's got good speed. He's very explosive. He can get up in the air
and he's certainly not afraid to battle in there."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Jeffries, the Burn coach, saw other qualities that make Ruiz
an offensive threat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's several things," Jeffries said. "He's fairly active. He's
very strong. He does a very good job using his body and holding off
defenders and putting himself in good spots."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy was in a tight spot itself before Ruiz rescued it. It
had yielded a goal in the 57th minute and was only six minutes from
its first defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas took the lead when Galaxy defender Danny Califf upended
Bobby Rhine just outside the L.A. penalty area and Prus awarded the
Burn a free kick.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy set up a defensive wall, but Jason Kreis blasted a shot
over the wall and into the upper left corner of the net off the
fingertips of goalkeeper Matt Reis.</TE>
<TE>   That appeared to be all Dallas would need, until Ruiz stepped in.</TE>
<TE>   "To be ahead, 1-0, in the 84th minute, it would have been nice to
walk away with all three points," Jeffries said. "So it's a little
bit disappointing on that end. But I think a point [each for the tie]
is a pretty fair result."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, by scoring five goals in three consecutive games, Ruiz
has tied an MLS record held by seven other players. There is a danger
in his early success, however.</TE>
<TE>   If he keeps on scoring, it won't be long before wealthier, more
prominent teams start to take notice, and that's the last thing the
Galaxy needs.</TE>

<HD>Harlan's Holiday in Front</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Blue Grass victory makes him Derby favorite.
Buddha wins Wood, Private Emblem wins Arkansas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Trainer Ken McPeek has a dental appointment Monday. It will be a
whole lot easier after Saturday's $750,000 Toyota Blue Grass Stakes
at Keeneland, where McPeek's Harlan's Holiday, a model of
consistency, won by 41/2 lengths to establish himself as a mild
favorite for the Kentucky Derby.</LD>
<LD>   In the 78th edition of the Blue Grass, Harlan's Holiday ran the
sixth slowest time over a fast track--11/8 miles in 1:512/5--and
after sifting through Saturday's prep races Mike Battaglia, the
Churchill Downs linemaker, said that if the Derby were run now, he'd
make the Blue Grass winner a 5-1 favorite. The rest of Battaglia's
early Derby line has Buddha and Medaglia d'Oro, the 1-2 finishers in
Saturday's Wood Memorial, at 6-1; Came Home, the Santa Anita Derby
winner, at 8-1; Sunday Break, third in the Wood, 10-1; and
Johannesburg, if he comes from Ireland, also at 10-1. A field of
close to 20, the Derby maximum, will run in Louisville on May 4.</LD>
<LD>   A number of 5-1 on a Derby favorite is hardly an endorsement. A
Derby choice has never gone off that high, and the only time there
was anything close on the tote board was when the entry of General
Challenge and Excellent Meeting had odds of $4.80 on the dollar in
1999.</LD>
<TE>   Harlan's Holiday will enter the Derby with a solid record--six
wins and four seconds in 10 starts and earnings of $1.4 million after
Saturday's $450,000 payday--but an Ohio-bred has won only one other
Derby and his winning time in the Blue Grass is just another pokey
effort by one of the contenders. On April 6, Came Home won the Santa
Anita Derby in the slowest time for the race since 1963.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some early rain that might have affected the track,"
McPeek said, trying to deflect too much inspection of Harlan's
Holiday's clocking. "They're not going to deduct anything from my
paycheck, are they?"</TE>
<TE>   Booklet, who had beaten Harlan's Holiday twice at shorter
distances early this year, has now been beaten twice--in the Florida
Derby and the Blue Grass--at 11/8 miles, and Saturday's loss all but
chased trainer John Ward Jr.'s colt out of the Kentucky Derby, which
is run at 11/4 miles. Booklet, the 5-2 second choice, ran second in
the Blue Grass, barely outlasting Ocean Sound, at 23-1, for the
place.</TE>
<TE>   "The Derby is the kind of decision you make four days after the
race, not today," said Ward, who won last year's Derby with
Monarchos.</TE>
<TE>   "But unless there's a lot of attrition, I think we'll pass on the
Derby. Harlan's Holiday will be the horse to beat at Churchill. He's
gotten better with each race."</TE>
<TE>   In a six-horse field, Straight Gin ran fourth, Bob's Image
finished fifth and Azillion, the 7-2 third choice, was last, leaving
jockey Corey Nakatani with the suspicion that something might be
wrong with the colt. It was reported after the race that Bob's Image,
who led for almost six furlongs, had suffered a suspensory ligament
injury to his left foreleg.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan's Holiday, who paid $3.40 as the favorite under Edgar
Prado, can become the first horse to complete a Florida Derby-Blue
Grass-Kentucky Derby triple since Spectacular Bid in 1979. He has
already run twice at Churchill, finishing second in his debut last
year and winning the Iroquois Stakes there in November. He has
trained most of his career at Churchill, the headquarters for
McPeek's large stable.</TE>
<TE>   After an opening half-mile in 47 seconds, Booklet overtook Bob's
Image as the board showed 1:114/5 for three-quarters of mile.
Harlan's Holiday, who was third early, moved up on the backstretch,
passed Booklet on the bend for home and increased his advantage as
Prado alternated left- and right-handed whipping through the
homestretch.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer James Cassidy said Ocean Sound, an Irish-bred who is
winless in four U.S. starts, would run in the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At Aqueduct in the $750,000 Wood, Buddha, making only his fourth
start, beat Medaglia d'Oro by a head under a typically patient--but
nerve-racking--ride from Pat Day. With Medaglia d'Oro and Sunday
Break applying pressure from the outside, Day got Buddha home on the
rail in a ride not unlike Wild Again's thrilling win in the first
Breeders' Cup Classic at Hollywood Park in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Break finished third, a half-length behind 2-1 favorite
Medaglia d'Oro, with Saarland fourth. All four horses are expected to
go on to the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Buddha paid $8.20, running 11/8 miles in 1:483/5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At Oaklawn Park, Private Emblem had his Derby ticket punched with
a 41/2-length victory over Wild Horses in the $500,000 Arkansas
Derby. Windward Passage and Bay Monster finished in a dead heat for
third place. Private Emblem, ridden by Donnie Meche, paid $10.40 and
ran 11/8 miles in 1:501/5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracemark may have taken 11 races to break his maiden, but Edward
T. McGrath's 3-year-old gelding won the $150,000 California Derby at
Bay Meadows and could be headed to the Kentucky Derby.</TE>

<HD>Budroyale, Who Rose From Claiming Ranks, Is Retired at 9</HD>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Budroyale, one of the best claims in the history of thoroughbred
racing, has been retired.</LD>
<LD>   A 9-year-old full brother to two-time Breeders' Cup Classic winner
Tiznow, Budroyale was trying to make another comeback for owner
Jeffrey Sengara and trainer Ted H. West, but the gelding had a
setback.</LD>
<LD>   Claimed for $50,000 early in 1998, the son of Cee's Tizzy finished
with earnings of nearly $2.85 million, winning 17 of 52 starts.</LD>
<TE>   He had stakes victories in the San Bernardino, Goodwood Breeders'
Cup, San Antonio and California Cup Classic at Santa Anita, the
Mervyn LeRoy and Super Diamond at Hollywood Park and the Longacres
Mile at Emerald Downs in Washington. The latter was especially
meaningful to Sengara because it was a race his late father had
always wanted to win.</TE>
<TE>   Besides that, he was runner-up at 26-1 to Cat Thief in the 1999
Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park and was second to General
Challenge in the Santa Anita Handicap in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel picked up his 13th stakes victory of the
Santa Anita meet, but it certainly did not come easy for 1-2 favorite
Megahertz in the $82,500 Providencia.</TE>
<TE>   The English-bred filly beat La Martina by a nose in 1:471/5 for
the 11/8 miles on turf.</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Kent Desormeaux continued his roll away from California
with horses from the state when he won the $150,000 Bay Shore Stakes
with Roman Dancer at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Later on the Aqueduct card, Affirmed Success, the 9-2 third choice
beat 41-1 longshot Voodoo by a length in the $350,000 Carter
Handicap.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Trainer Bob Baffert does have a quality 3-year-old in his barn who
can handle a distance of ground that was not purchased impulsively
days ago.</LD>
<LD>   So, why isn't Mountain Rage headed to the Kentucky Derby? Because
the son of Mecke is strictly a turf horse and the gray will seek his
third consecutive victory over the surface in the $75,000 La Puente
Stakes today at Santa Anita. The race is the fifth leg in a pick six
with a carryover of $182,443.</LD>
<LD>   A winner only once in four races on the dirt--and that victory
came at Fairplex Park--Mountain Rage has won three of four on turf.
His victories have come in the Generous, a Grade III, last fall at
Hollywood Park, and in the Hill Rise and Academy Road at Santa Anita.</LD>
<TE>   Despite his accomplishments, Mountain Rage is only the second
choice--at 5-2--on Jeff Tufts' morning line because the 2-1 favorite
is Johar. Owned and bred by Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred
Corporation and trained by Richard Mandella, Johar is out of the
multiple stakes winning mare Windsharp. He has won both of his grass
races.</TE>
<TE>   After beating maidens by a neck on Feb. 24, the bay colt dominated
six allowance rivals on March 28, winning by 3 1/2 lengths while
completing the final quarter of a mile in about 23 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Bella Bellucci, one of the top 3-year-old fillies
in the country, will try for her second graded stakes victoryin the
$100,000 Comely at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Victor Espinoza. The jockey won four races at Santa
Anita on Saturday and none of them were favorites.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Wood Kat. The 6-year-old is winless in eight since
arriving in the United States in 1999. He'll try to end the streak in
today's sixth at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Big Bad Juan in the
fifth, using Captian Bell, Lasting Tribute, Devil's Horn and Eddie
Eddie in the sixth and Power Wing, Fin Entertainment and Tough Men in
the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/219. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $6.40/$1,268.60. Total money bet: $1,360.</TE>

<HD>College Celebrations Turn to Hooliganism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY JENKINS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one is more sympathetic toward criminality in undergraduates than
me, seeing as how much of my own behavior comes perilously close to
theirs.</LD>
<LD>   That said, even in my most youthfully exuberant and egregiously
over-served moment, it never once occurred to me to set fire to a
kiosk with a Zippo. Some hated textbooks, yes, and a mattress once.
But a kiosk, never.</LD>
<LD>   What is that about?</LD>
<TE>   Student rioting after sports events can now be legitimately termed
hooliganism; it is developing into a full-fledged pathology akin to
that of British soccer fans.</TE>
<TE>   Three events in the last couple of weeks proved it. First, the
Maryland campus, as usual, was the site of rampant destruction after
the Terrapins won the NCAA basketball title. Then, just when we
decided Terrapins fans were worse than others, a riot broke out among
students at the University of Minnesota after the Gophers won the
NCAA hockey championship. Finally, on Tuesday came a report from a
government task force on college drinking: half a million undergrads
each year are hurt in accidents related to alcohol abuse, more than
600,000 annually are assaulted by another student who has been
drinking, and about 1,400 students die each year. A full third of the
8 million college students met the criteria for alcohol abuse.</TE>
<TE>   So there you have it -- it doesn't take an egghead social
scientist to tell us what's going on. Why do they do it? Well, for
one thing, they're drunk.</TE>
<TE>   Before we go any further, let me state outright my position on
rioting undergrads: While I am all in favor of a certain amount of
benign unruliness, if one of them comes toward my car with a baseball
bat and swings at the headlights, I would be hard-pressed not to tap
the shoulder of the nearest police officer and say, "Shoot him."</TE>
<TE>   In order to curb destructive behavior by students, first we have
to figure out what's in the cocktail that is producing it. The answer
is, liquor mixed with permission.</TE>
<TE>   In an essay entitled "Understanding Riots," two Northwestern
University law professors, David Haddock and Daniel Polsby, set out
to more fully explain what causes a mob action. They weren't
satisfied with the conventional shopworn explanations: repressed
social rage resulting from poverty, racism, breakdown of traditional
family values, and bad television, kicked off by signal traumatic
events such as political assassination or a jury verdict.</TE>
<TE>   As Haddock and Polsby point out, social circumstances like poverty
are with us constantly, while riots are episodic spasms. What's more,
incidents like those at Maryland and Minnesota are ignited by good
news--the rioters are really revelers. What to make of that?</TE>
<TE>   These students are not rioting out of rage--Maryland kids are
hardly the martyrs of Tiananmen Square. The Northwestern law
professors believe that sports riots are not expressions of
deep-seated social anger, but rather, they are gratifying
rule-breaking experiences that take place because the revelers are
pretty sure they won't get caught or prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds like those who rioted at Maryland and Minnesota gather in
full expectation that something will happen--they know mischief is
afoot--and that's exactly why they're there, for a flout-the-law
binge. And they are secure in their anonymity in such a big crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "People who may have never met are nonetheless capable of
coordinating their behavior under some circumstances," Haddock and
Polsby write.</TE>
<TE>   Their nominal excuse is their fan-passion. But it's a bogus one.
As author Bill Buford discovered, after studying British soccer
hooligans for his book "Among the Thugs," many rioters barely watched
the games, and were more interested in the postgame events.</TE>
<TE>   There is a subtle kind of permission at work in the student riots.
First, the undergrads award themselves the liberty of acting out in
the name of fan enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, they tend to believe that they are apart from the law,
enjoying the last of their childhood immunity from prosecution.
Attorney Luis Bartolomei, who is advising some of the Minnesota
students who were arrested, is lobbying for lesser charges because,
he said, "a felony might make them virtually unemployable. So what's
the use of coming to college?" In other words, college kids are
entitled to leniency, no matter what, because they are in college
instead of the real world?</TE>
<TE>   Authorities grant them permission as well. Cops stood by and
watched as the crowds in College Park, Md., and in Minnesota gathered
and caroused; it wasn't until the bonfires and the smashing of glass
began that they stepped in.</TE>
<TE>   Col. David Mitchell, head of the Maryland state police, said, "We
wanted to have a measured and appropriate response." In Minnesota,
police chief Robert Olson waited until 3 a.m. before he intervened,
after students threw beer bottles and cans, smashed street lamps,
jumped on passing cars, torched furniture in a bonfire, and injured
six officers. Finally, here came the pepper spray pellets.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Minnesota students are now saying that the police
response was excessive.</TE>
<TE>   Riots will happen--they aren't going to stop altogether as long as
angry drunken louts congregate. But they can be limited and even
stopped on campuses if we remove the subtle permission, and replace
it with major consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Buford in "Among The Thugs" describes how the Sardinian police
dealt with British soccer hooligans during the 1990 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Large numbers of cops isolated the rioters into small groups,
surrounded them, and beat them senseless with truncheons. This saved
police the time-consuming trouble of arresting and booking the
culprits and it also prevented rioters from re-massing elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Now, this isn't a realistic or acceptable solution in Prince
George's County, Md. But a felony charge certainly is.</TE>
<TE>   The law professors suggest "two things have to happen to
discourage them or stop them early before they get started: either
the probability of catching the offender has to be visibly increased,
or the consequences to the offender if he gets caught have to be
tangibly enhanced."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the next time college kids ruin someone's store or
put someone's eye out, throw them in the slammer. Prosecute them to
the full extent of the law.</TE>
<TE>   If they wind up cleaning grease traps at the local McDonald's, so
be it.</TE>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Backup goaltender Jamie Storr will make only his 12th start of the
season but his third against the Mighty Ducks in today's
regular-season finale at Staples Center, ending a string of 21 in a
row by Felix Potvin.</LD>
<LD>   "Jamie deserves to play and the guys are excited about him getting
the chance," Coach Andy Murray said before Saturday's game against
the San Jose Sharks.</LD>
<LD>   Storr, whose 2.03 goals-against average and .917 save percentage
would rank among the league leaders if he'd played enough minutes, is
1-0-1 against the Ducks with a 1.92 goals-against average and .935
save percentage.</LD>
<TE>   Potvin's appearance Saturday was his 71st of the season, breaking

<DL></DL>
<LD>These days around the Lakers are spent studying Shaquille O'Neal--his
mood, his gait, his manner.</LD>
<LD>   He is the window to their goal, that being a third consecutive NBA
title.</LD>
<LD>   It is nearly O'Neal's time, of course, but only if his vitality
arrives at the same time his body and the team bus do. He is twice
the most valuable player of the NBA Finals, but was reasonably
healthy in both, and this year can't expect to be.</LD>
<TE>   And so he left the team's training facility at El Segundo on
Saturday with an obvious limp, and twirling his right wrist. That he
participated in some of a Phil Jackson practice for the first time in
the season's second half would have seemed reason for Laker optimism,
except O'Neal shook his head and twirled his right wrist again.</TE>
<TE>   "I know," he said, "but I don't take the drugs on practice days."</TE>
<TE>   Without the Indocin, his anti-inflammatory of choice, his head was
clear and his stomach calm, but his arthritic toe thumped and his
sprained wrist tightened.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a good practice for me," he said. "I was slow. I was a
bum today."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are only too pleased to have O'Neal's four-day-a-week
lethargy, if that means he can be dynamic on the other three. He's
almost certain to have surgery on his toe during the off-season, and
he'll have plenty of time to rest the other parts of him that hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be well-rested and well-prepared," O'Neal said. "I'll be
ready. Playoffs are a good time for me."</TE>
<TE>   Three days after he flat-out skipped a practice, he ran with the
regulars for more than five minutes, which was something.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, it was a conditioning thing because we didn't work
[Friday]," Jackson said. "It's good for us and him, too, I think."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said the decision to practice was neither his nor
O'Neal's. It just happened.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't mention it to me," he said. "I just had him out there,
the normal process of practice. He did pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers play the Portland Trail Blazers today at the Rose
Garden, the last of four regular-season games between the Pacific
Division adversaries and a probable preview of the playoff matchup
between the third- and sixth-seeded teams in the Western Conference.
For the first time since Oct. 30, O'Neal and Rasheed Wallace will be
on the same court, with various circumstances leading to O'Neal
sitting out the second game of the series and Wallace the third.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see how they [work] their rotation, how they're going to
play, what their defense is going to be," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   While there is some sense that the Lakers wouldn't want to provide
too hearty of an effort, for reasons of energy and strategy
conservation, the Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs aren't far
enough behind.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we have any room to do so," Jackson said. "We did
gain half a game [Thursday] on Dallas. So, obviously, we have a
little bit of breathing room. But we don't have a lot of room to not
play well or [not] play the game we want to play against this team,
win the series against them and let them know we want to win on their
home court."</TE>

<KH>LONG BEACH GRAND PRIX NOTES</KH>
<HD>Swimmer Torres Makes a Splash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saturday was Ladies Day at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in the 26-year history of the Toyota
Pro/Celebrity race, a woman took the checkered flag.</LD>
<LD>   Swimmer Dara Torres, an Olympic gold medalist, started from the
pole and ran away from the rest of the celebrity field, doing
something that previous stars Cameron Diaz, Ashley Judd and Crystal
Bernard could not.</LD>
<TE>   Torres wasn't alone. Danica Patrick, a 20-year-old from Illinois
who raced in Europe the last few years, won the professional category
and finished third overall despite starting 30 seconds behind the
leader on the 1.97-mile street course.</TE>
<TE>   Racing in identically prepared Toyota Celicas, Torres pulled away
from No. 2 qualifier Bill Goldberg, a former wrestler who completed
only four laps before crashing, and led by more than six seconds
going into the last of 10 laps. Pumping her arm out the window before
taking the checkered flag, Torres won by 3.31 seconds over actor
Christopher Kennedy Masterson.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a really solid driver who goes fast, brakes late and makes
very few mistakes," said Masterson, the oldest brother on the sitcom
"Malcom in the Middle."</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, in our class, she's the very best."</TE>
<TE>   Torres won the pole last year and was leading on the last lap,
only to spin out when hit by another driver. "It took me six months
to get over that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick snaked her way past 10 of the 12 celebrities and, despite
the starting handicap, finished 8.06 seconds behind Torres. Four-time
Trans-Am champion Tommy Kendall was fourth, and two-time Indy 500
starter Sarah Fisher was fifth, giving women three of the top five
positions.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it has anything to do with women," Patrick said.
"We were all drivers out there doing what we were brought here to do.</TE>
<TE>   "The car doesn't know the difference between a girl or a guy."</TE>
<TE>   Kendall, the most accomplished of the five professional drivers,
said that celebrities are getting such good instruction from Danny
McKeever's Fast Lane Driving School, and the race is so short, the
professionals are going to have a tough time winning again.</TE>
<TE>   "Without yellow flags, it's going to be rarer and rarer for the
pros to win overall," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ford and Honda might be out of CART in 2003, but MG Rover
announced Saturday that it is in. The English manufacturer is the
first to confirm participation under CART's new rules calling for a
3.5-liter normally aspirated V8 engine. Cosworth, the current
manufacturer of Ford's racing engines, has indicated it will continue
in the series.</TE>
<TE>   In partnership with Engine Developments Ltd, the builder of Judd
engines, the XV powerplant will be developed jointly using the basic
architecture from the existing Judd V8 and V10 engines. Max Papis
drove a V10-powered car that won this year's Rolex 24 at Daytona.
Bobby Rahal won the 1988 Pocono 500 in a Judd-powered Lola.</TE>
<TE>   "[This] is one of the single-most positive developments I have
seen since I joined the organization [in December]," said CART
President and Chief Executive Chris Pook. "As a native Englishman, I
am honored to have one of Great Britain's premier brands join CART."</TE>
<TE>   CART began racing last season in England.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dorricott Racing won two of the last three titles in the defunct
Dayton Indy Lights Championship--a step above Toyota Atlantics in
CART's ladder system--and opened this season with a victory in the
rain at Monterrey, Mexico, with rookie driver Jon Fogarty.</TE>
<TE>   But veteran Atlantic teams threw down the gauntlet Saturday during
qualifying, relegating Bob Dorricott's racing bloc to fourth, fifth
and sixth on the starting grid.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers for veteran Atlantic teams held the top positions as Joey
Hand qualified first, Michael Valiante second and rookie Ryan
Hunter-Reay third.</TE>
<TE>   Hand, driving for DSTP Motorsports, averaged 90.494 mph to win the
pole, and Valiante of Lynx racing averaged 90.463.</TE>
<TE>   However, Hunter-Reay of Hylton Motorsports guaranteed himself a
spot on the front by being the top qualifier during Friday's session.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of hoopla going in that [Dorricott] was going to
dominate moving over because it's a very professional team and has
very good personnel, but we always felt a strength in ourselves,"
said Hunter-Reay's owner, Keith Hylton, whose Irvine-based team won
its first championship last season with Hoover Orsi. "They're
definitely a target. We want to back that championship up and know
it's for real."</TE>
<TE>   Fogarty will start fourth, Alex Gurney fifth and rookie Luis Diaz
sixth for Dorricott.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Gentilozzi and Boris Said started on the front row last year
at Long Beach, and will do the same today in the Trans-Am series'
Johnson Controls 100. Last year, the two made contact, and
Gentilozzi's day ended on the first lap.</TE>
<TE>   Gentilozzi, a three-time Long Beach winner, will start from the
pole after averaging 86.854 mph, ahead of Said's 86.594. Both drivers
are well aware of the perils of racing on the street.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a race of attrition," said Gentilozzi, a three-time
series champion. "It's easy to make a mistake here, clip a wall,
flat-spot the tires. It's easy to get caught up emotionally."</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened to Said last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have won if I didn't let my ego get in the way," Said
said. "I watched Paul put it in the fence, and then I was driving as
fast as I could every lap for no reason. I could have backed off 10
or 15%."</TE>
<TE>   And then Said put his car into the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Lou Gigliotti went on to win. He will start fifth, behind Butch
Leitzinger, who was third, and Michael Lewis, who was fourth.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the first Trans-Am race in Long Beach in which
drivers will be forced to pit. The series reduced the allowable fuel
load, forcing mandatory pit stops.</TE>
<TE>   "All real racing has pit stops," Said said. "I think it's good. It
makes the team more involved."</TE>

* Schedule: Today, race (Ch. 11, 12:30 p.m.)
* Track: Long Beach Street Circuit (temporary road course, 1.968
miles, 11 turns)
* Race distance: 90 laps, 177.12 miles
* Last race: Cristiano da Matta ran a nearly flawless race to
successfully defend his Monterrey Grand Prix title on March 10. The
Brazilian has three consecutive CART victories
* Last year: Helio Castroneves fought off Da Matta to win the Toyota
Grand Prix. The two Brazilians put on a sensational show in the last
half of the race, with Castroneves holding off Da Matta by 0.534
seconds
* Fast facts: A win by Da Matta this week will tie the CART record
for consecutive victories. Al Unser Jr. (1990) and Alex Zanardi
(1998) hold the record with four. Christian Fittipaldi has not won
since the 2000 season-ending race at California Speedway. Castroneves
won from the pole last year, the first driver to do so at Long Beach
since Unser Jr. in 1990. The best finish for a Toyota was third, in
2000 by Jimmy Vasser. Mario Andretti won three of the first four
events at Long Beach. Paul Tracy owns the track record for fastest
winning speed by going 82.626 mph in 2000

<LD>Trainer R C Howell made longshot players happy Friday night when he
won the first with 28-1 shot Red Lipstick, a debuting 2-year-old who
overcame a slow start to beat six other rookies.</LD>
<LD>   Howell may win another race tonight at Los Alamitos, but the price
will be a lot shorter on Sables Dash.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-year-old Dash Thru Traffic filly is the 9-5 favorite in the
eighth, a $12,500 allowance at 350 yards.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Stephanie Turbeville, Sables Dash has won two of seven
and could be riding a two-race win streak into this evening if not
for a slow beginning on March 7. As the 13-10 favorite that night,
she was making her first start in more than six months and wound up
missing by a nose to 6-1 shot Shake N Shout.</TE>
<TE>   Rodrigo Aceves, who has ridden the filly in her last two races,
has the call again and they will break from the inside in the field
of seven.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Power Trip. 2. Bedas Special. 3. Eraser Reb. 4.
Royal Classic Express. 5. Serenity Dash. 6. Robert's Legend. 7. Hes
Spotless. 8. Sables Dash. 9. Rebs Bunny Lane.</TE>
<TE>   Four!  Let's use Fred Too and Power Trip in the first, Lotta
Hatchet Jack and Bedas Special in the second, Eraser Reb, Grand
Prospect and Dash For Reb in the third and Royal Classic Express and
Deefirst in the fourth. Total cost: $24.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Mr. Nifty was wide in his first at Los Alamitos
after a three-month layoff and could improve in tonight's sixth.
Wholelotta Dash adds Lasix in his second after a long vacation in the
eighth.</TE>

<KH>LONDON MARATHON</KH>
<HD>Runners Face Blood Tests</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The London Marathon sets itself apart today, and not just for its
powerful field or the possibility of a world record.</LD>
<LD>   It will become the first major marathon to conduct blood tests on
all elite entrants.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a wonderful thing," said long-distance star Haile
Gebrselassie, who will run in his first marathon since he was 15.
"That's what I wanted. That's really important--to find the honest
athlete, the ones who do good training."</LD>
<TE>   Race director Dave Bedford said he has the support of all athletes
and agents.</TE>
<TE>   If an initial drug test comes back positive, Bedford said, the
runner would be allowed to compete. The runner would be disqualified
only if a second sample also was positive.</TE>
<TE>   All prize and appearance money would be forfeited in a
disqualification.</TE>
<TE>   Gebrselassie is perhaps the greatest distance runner ever, with 15
world records, two Olympic gold medals and four world titles at
10,000 meters.</TE>
<TE>   Now the 28-year-old Ethiopian embarks on something new. He has
promised to go after the marathon record of 2 hours 5 minutes 42
seconds held by Moroccan-born American Khalid Khannouchi. Khannouchi
is in the field, as are a dozen of the best marathoners.</TE>
<TE>   Gebrselassie intends to run the first half in 1:02:30, which would
put him on a pace of 2:04:49 for the 26.2 miles.</TE>
<TE>   If Gebrselassie sets the world mark, he will be the first to do it
in London since 1965, when Morio Shigematsu ran 2:12:00.</TE>
<TE>   But to do so, Gebrselassie will have to outrun Kenya's Paul
Tergat, the world-record holder in the half-marathon (59:17),
Khannouchi and defending champion Abdelkader El Mouaziz of Morocco
(2:07:11 personal best), among others.</TE>

<DH>With Schottenheimer on Board, There's No Question Who's
Calling Shots in San Diego</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Long before he was one of the most successful coaches in the NFL,
Marty Schottenheimer was an English major at the University of
Pittsburgh. He even got a degree.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps that's how he acquired his skill with understatement and
foreshadowing--a talent he now uses to explain how he plans to coach
the woeful San Diego Chargers--6-26 the last two seasons--into
contention for a Super Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to be accelerating our learning curve,"
Schottenheimer said at a recent mini-camp for veterans as he surveyed
the players he inherited from Mike Riley, who was fired in December.</LD>
<TE>   Schottenheimer, 58, is one of the best accelerators in the game.
His offense may not be flashy, and the knock on his tough-it-out
style is that his teams tire late in the season, but in 15 seasons as
a head coach he is 153-93-1 and his teams have made the playoffs 11
times, won six division titles and advanced to three AFC championship
games.</TE>
<TE>   If he judges a player's learning curve to be lacking,
Schottenheimer is known to accelerate his departure to other teams
and other lines of work. His first appraisal of the Chargers is not
altogether favorable.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not in good shape, frankly," he said. "We've got a lot of
work to do. But I've got no doubt this is a group that is willing to
work."</TE>
<TE>   Only Don Shula (19), Tom Landry (18), Chuck Noll (12) and Bud
Grant (12) have taken teams to the playoffs more often than
Schottenheimer. But those four coaches share a distinction that has
eluded Schottenheimer: All have been to a Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Schottenheimer doesn't fester on his lack of a Super Bowl
appearance but neither does he hide the fact that the chance to take
a team to the biggest game helped convince him to heed the call from
Charger General Manager John Butler. He could easily have eased into
retirement or back to the broadcast booth.</TE>
<TE>   His financial settlement after one tumultuous season as coach of
the Washington Redskins--a reported $7.5 million--could have made for
a comfortable retirement. But within weeks of being dismissed by
Redskin owner Daniel Snyder in a power struggle, he was bound for San
Diego and talking--what else?--Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen," he told reporters upon arrival, "if you're not
interested in winning a world's championship, if that's not your
goal, you should be in another business."</TE>
<TE>   His reputation as a disciplinarian has preceded him, and Charger
players say they already feel a chastening change from the Riley era.
"Martyball"--the tag given to Schottenheimer's brand of tough defense
and run-till-you-drop offense--starts with a new attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year we would go to practice and not really know what was
expected of us," running back LaDainian Tomlinson said. "This year,
we're going to know."</TE>
<TE>   "He's already cut a lot of fat off our plate," defensive end
Marcellus Wiley said. "He's so confident. You lose nine games in a
row [as the Chargers did in 2001], you need a lot of things and
discipline is in that dictionary."</TE>
<TE>   Schottenheimer favors players who share his eyes-on-the-prize
approach. One of his first acquisitions in San Diego was former
Redskin tight end Stephen Alexander, who says, "I want a Super Bowl
ring."</TE>
<TE>   Practices for a Schottenheimer team are long and arduous.
Discussion is fine, dissent is not.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can get through one of his training camps," said center
Cory Raymer, another recent arrival from Washington, "you can get
through anything."</TE>
<TE>   Reporters too have felt the change: Interviews with assistant
coaches are forbidden without Schottenheimer's approval. Management
speaks with one voice: Schottenheimer's.</TE>
<TE>   With players he is egalitarian. He will treat linebacker Junior
Seau the same as he does the rookies from the upcoming draft--a fact
that suits the 11-time Pro Bowler just fine.</TE>
<TE>   "He demands more of a work ethic," than previous Charger coaches,
Seau said. "He's a guy who wears his personality on his shoulders.
He's direct. There are no gray areas."</TE>
<TE>   Schottenheimer also believes that if anyone is not comfortable
with the organization or no longer is capable of a total effort, he
should move on. He has done it three times himself.</TE>
<TE>   He left the Cleveland Browns in 1988 after four seasons when owner
Art Modell wanted him to hire an offensive coordinator. After 10
years in Kansas City, he abruptly retired after the 1998 season,
saying he needed a break and that it was time for someone else to get
a chance to take the Chiefs to the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I was given 10 years to get it done and I didn't get it done," he
said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   After two seasons as an ESPN analyst, he was lured to the Redskins
last year with a four-year contract and a chance to resume his Super
Bowl quest. "I want my father to leave football with a Super Bowl
ring," said Brian Schottenheimer as he followed his father to
Washington as quarterbacks coach. "He's earned that."</TE>
<TE>   But the Redskins went 8-8--same as a year earlier--and Snyder
wanted Schottenheimer to relinquish authority over player moves, a
demand Schottenheimer found unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, he apparently has the level of control he feels is
necessary and has reached an understanding with Butler, a
tough-minded ex-Marine whose blustery personality clashed with the
low-key Riley.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to become a football team," Schottenheimer said. "That
entails attention to detail, it entails focus and concentration. the
little things make everything in this game."</TE>
<TE>   A year ago Riley handed the starting quarterback job to Doug
Flutie, newly arrived from the Buffalo Bills, and stuck with the
veteran despite the losing streak. Schottenheimer prefers competition
between Flutie and last year's rookie backup, Drew Brees.</TE>
<TE>   "With the intensity that Marty brings to the meetings, to the
practice field, there's a sense of urgency in every drill, in
everything we do," Flutie said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, many of the Charger fans are weary of a team that has
not made the playoffs since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   At the mini-camp, Schottenheimer cheerfully signed autographs for
a small gathering of fans, some of whom could not suppress their
edginess. When a fan mentioned Super Bowl, Schottenheimer was
careful, saying, "We're taking one step at a time. We want to win the
first game."</TE>
<TE>   The answer was not careful enough for a more assertive autograph
seeker. "Hey, Marty," he yelled sharply. "Let's just concentrate on a
winning record. Don't mention a Super Bowl. You'll jinx it."</TE>
<TE>   Later Schottenheimer was asked by reporters to suggest just what
year he thinks the Chargers will go the distance. He demurred.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't make predictions," he said. "I set goals and objectives,
and the objective here is clearly to win the championship."</TE>
<TE>   There's that precise use of language again.</TE>

<HD>Army Gives Arnie One Last Salute</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>Arnold Palmer finished his long goodbye to an appreciative gallery
and a standing ovation Saturday morning as he walked up the 18th
fairway before completing his rain-delayed 147th and final round at
the Masters.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing a pink shirt and blue slacks, Palmer fought back tears,
smiled and waved, gave a thumbs-up and even took a bow, but he was
not alone with his thoughts.</LD>
<LD>   "The tournaments that I won. Some I lost. And certainly, as all of
you know, there were both sides of it," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Palmer, 72, played his last two holes in his last round at Augusta
National with a bogey and double bogey and signed for an 85. He shot
an 89 in the first round. Palmer's 36-hole total of 174 was 30 over
par, but two shots better than his worst two-round total of 176 in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   With Palmer, his score is irrelevant. Robert Hamilton, 24, the
U.S. Amateur runner-up from Berkeley, played both rounds with Palmer,
as did Toru Taniguchi  of Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer signed Hamilton's cap on the 18th green.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to soak up as much as I could," Hamilton said. "This is a
great moment in my life, a story for my grandchildren--where I was
when Arnold Palmer walked up 18 at the Masters. I got goose bumps."</TE>
<TE>   Taniguchi said he was honored to play with Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised to see so many people watching every move he
makes, and the cheering," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first Masters for Hamilton and Taniguchi. It was the
48th for Palmer, a four-time champion.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer has now said goodbye to each of the four majors. His last
U.S. Open was in 1994 at Oakmont Country Club, near where he grew up
in suburban Pittsburgh. Palmer's last PGA Championship was also in
1994, at Southern Hills, and he played his last British Open in 1995
at St. Andrews.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, who said he hasn't made up his mind about joining Sam
Snead as an honorary starter at next year's Masters, doesn't know
what will happen to Arnie's Army.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I'm not sure, but I think from all indications, it will
just continue as it has," he said. "You know, I have thousands of
people writing me all the time about it, appointing themselves to
various positions. Colonels, some of them are privates who think they
are generals."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chris Perry must have wanted to see Palmer complete his last round
at the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Perry missed the cut Friday in the Buy.com tour event in
Lafayette, La., then drove 12 hours to catch Palmer's exit, taking a
quick nap at a rest stop on his way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He had two holes to make up in the morning to complete his second
round and make the cut, so Nick Faldo parred both holes and got in by
two shots.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the legendary Faldo concentration," he said after
finally finishing his five-under 67.</TE>
<TE>   As an unusual added attraction, both of Faldo's playing partners,
Hal Sutton and Frank Lickliter, dropped out because of injury. Faldo
completed his second round Saturday with a marker, John Harris.</TE>
<TE>   Said Faldo: "Don't touch me ... something might happen."</TE>
<TE>   Faldo bogeyed the last two holes in his third round of 73 and is
at one-under 215.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was time to say goodbye to David Duval, one of the
pre-tournament favorites, who had rounds of 74-74--148 and missed the
cut by a shot.</TE>
<TE>   Duval, who played the last six holes in three over, said the
conditions were difficult because it was so wet. He was asked if he
had a solution.</TE>
<TE>   "Carry a mat with you?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Els bogeyed the 18th to drop into a three-way tie for fourth
at seven under, four shots behind leaders Tiger Woods and Retief
Goosen, and he wasn't pleased with the outcome. After three holes,
Els was only one shot out of the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed, but I'm not out of it," he said. "I just didn't
hit the shots at the right time.</TE>
<TE>   "Tiger is at 11 [under] and I don't see him backing up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Padraig Harrington had an even worse finish. He double-bogeyed the
18th when he drove left into the trees, hit a four-iron out and
chipped over the green.</TE>
<TE>   "Every shot you take, you have to be aware of the dangers,"
Harrington said after 72 left him at five under, tied for eighth with
Thomas Bjorn, who had a 70.</TE>

<LD>Scott Riggs led only once for the final 47 laps Saturday as he got
his first NASCAR Busch series victory in his seventh start on the
circuit at the Pepsi 300 at Gladeville, Tenn., tying a record for the
quickest victory by a rookie.</LD>
<LD>   Johnny Rumley also won in his seventh start, in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   Riggs became the first rookie to win on the Busch circuit this
season as crew chief Harold Holly gambled in the final pit stop,
taking only two tires and gas.</LD>
<TE>   He took the lead on Lap 179 and started stretching out his lead in
his Ford in winning with an average speed of 111.038 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Darrell Waltrip's return to racing ended long before the Advance
Auto Parts 250 did and Dennis Setzer passed Terry Cook with 43 laps
to go at Martinsville, Va. and went on to his seventh career win.</TE>
<TE>   Waltrip, who retired in from Winston Cup racing 2000, lasted only
86 laps as a one-race fill-in for NASCAR truck series driver Stacy
Compton before the rear end in his leaking Dodge failed.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bliss rallied to finish second, also in a Chevy, followed by
Rick Crawford in a Ford, Bobby Dotter in a Chevy and Cook.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   World champion Michael Schumacher won the pole position in record
time for the San Marino Grand Prix, setting up an all-Ferrari front

<HD>Nowitzki Out, but Mavericks Still Roll</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dirk Nowitzki didn't play Saturday night, but he vows he will before
the regular season ends.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll definitely play Tuesday and Wednesday for sure and hopefully
be ready for the playoffs," Nowitzki said after his Dallas Mavericks
rolled over the Seattle SuperSonics, 116-99, at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Even with Nowitzki missing his third consecutive game because of a
sprained left ankle, the Mavericks looked like a team that was ready
to challenge for the NBA title.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Finley scored 29 points and Nick Van Exel had 22 for the
Mavericks in a matchup of possible first-round playoff opponents.</TE>
<TE>   If the Mavericks (55-24) win the Midwest Division and the
SuperSonics (44-36) finish No. 7 in the Western Conference, they'll
meet in an opening round best-of-five playoff series.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 109, Golden State 101--John Stockton had 26 points and nine
assists as the Jazz moved into a tie for seventh place in the Western
Conference, with a victory at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz and the SuperSonics both have 44-36 records, but Utah
took three of four from Seattle for the tiebreaker edge.</TE>
<TE>   Denver 98, Phoenix 94--Voshon Lenard scored 28 points and Donnell
Harvey had 15 points and 10 rebounds as the Nuggets won at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Denver has won five in a row at home and took the season series
(3-1) from Phoenix for first time since 1995-96.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 124, Chicago 106--Chucky Atkins scored 20 of his
season-high 26 points in the first half as the Pistons defeated the
Bulls at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Atkins' 15-footer in the first quarter sparked an 11-3 run that
gave Detroit a 31-23 lead, and the Pistons never trailed again.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 113, Memphis 92--Tim Duncan scored 30 points and Malik
Rose had a season-high 26 as the Spurs won at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   The Grizzlies allowed the Spurs to score 44 points in the first
quarter, the most ever against the franchise--including its time in
Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 128, Cleveland 123--Jason Terry had 43 points, including a
tying three-pointer with less than a second left in regulation, and
the Hawks rallied to defeat the Cavaliers in double overtime at
Atlanta.</TE>

<LD>Venus Williams was down, if only for a moment.</LD>
<LD>   The top seed in the Bausch &amp; Lomb Championships stormed back from
a 5-3 deficit in the first set to defeat unseeded Anne Kremer, 7-5,
6-0, Saturday and reach the final of the $585,000 clay-court event at
Amelia Island, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, who struggled with her serve before winning the last 10
games, will meet No. 2 Justine Henin for the title today. Henin was
leading her semifinal, 6-2, 4-1, when No. 3 Jelena Dokic retired
because of a stomach virus.</LD>
<TE>   Like Henin and Dokic, Kremer was playing her second match of the
day because rain the last four days threw the tournament schedule out
of whack.</TE>

quarterfinals earlier Saturday, but didn't have enough left to keep
pace when Williams corrected the problem with her serve.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic had defeated 10th-seeded Elena Dementieva, 0-6, 7-6, 6-1, in

<HD>Canucks Defeat Flames</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Markus Naslund scored his 40th goal of the season and added an assist
as the Vancouver Canucks beat the Calgary Flames, 4-1, on Saturday
night at Calgary, Alberta, to finish the regular season with a
nine-game unbeaten streak.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Canucks have no idea who they'll be playing when the
playoffs begin, they enter the postseason on one of the best runs in
the NHL this season: an 8-0-1 streak.</LD>
<LD>   Naslund has been an important factor in that streak, tallying nine
goals and eight assists.</LD>
<TE>   Vancouver is tied for fifth in the Western Conference with
Chicago, but ranks ahead of the Blackhawks because of more victories.</TE>
<TE>   However, with the three teams behind them playing today, the
Canucks could drop back into the eighth spot depending on the
outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   With a win today, Phoenix (hosting Nashville) would move back past
the Canucks in the standings. Chicago needs only one point in its
home game against Columbus to finish ahead of the Canucks.</TE>
<TE>   All of Naslund's damage came in the third period as Vancouver took
advantage of a string of Calgary penalties to score goals 68 seconds
apart midway through the period, both coming with a two-man
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Morrison's goal at 8:46 of the third made it 3-1 and
Naslund beat goaltender Mike Vernon from the top of the faceoff
circle at 9:54.</TE>
<TE>   NHL leading scorer Jarome Iginla was held scoreless and finished
the season with 52 goals and 96 points.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Detroit 2--Chris Pronger scored unassisted, from the
top of the slot, with 1:09 left in overtime for the Blues at St.
Louis. The Blues had not defeated Detroit since scoring a 4-1 victory
on Feb. 8, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings took a 1-0 lead on their first shot of the game.
Brett Hull scored his 30th goal 2:39 into the first period on a
deflection of a shot by Chris Chelios. It was the 700th career assist
for Chelios, who is the 37th player in NHL history to reach that
mark.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 2, New York Rangers 1--Adam Oates and Mark Recchi
scored to help the Flyers win at Philadelphia and clinch the Atlantic
Division title. Eric Lindros, playing his second game at the First
Union Center since his bitter departure from the Flyers last summer,
was booed often.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 7, Pittsburgh 1--Glen Murray scored three goals, giving him
41 this season, to help the host Bruins end a five-game winless
streak and clinch the top spot in the Eastern Conference. Bill Guerin
also scored his 41st goal for Boston, giving the Bruins two 40-goal
scorers for the first time since Rick Middleton and Barry Pederson
did it in 1982-83.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 4, Washington 3--Scott Niedermayer scored 1:53 into
overtime for the Devils at Washington. In the regular-season finale
for both teams, the Devils moved one point ahead of the New York
Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo 3, Montreal 0--Martin Biron made 22 saves for his fourth
shutout of the season and Miroslav Satan scored his team-leading 37th
goal for the Sabres at Montreal. Buffalo will miss the playoffs for
the first time since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Ottawa 2--Mats Sundin had a goal and three assists as
the Maple Leafs won at Ottawa, spoiling Roger Neilson's 1,000th
regular-season game as an NHL coach.</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Kings on Road to Early Playoff Exit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Let's just hope that the Kings are pulling a Muhammad Ali
"Rope-a-Dope," because if they aren't, Coach Andy Murray and the boys
certainly will not be around long once the playoffs begin this week,
based on their lame efforts in consecutive defeats at Vancouver and
San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   The once-confident Kings, who hit the road Thursday riding a
four-game home unbeaten streak, played like a fragile team away from
Staples Center in two crucial games that had major postseason
implications.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings fell apart in the third period of a three-goal loss to
the Canucks, and two days later, failed to make enough plays down the
stretch in a 3-1 defeat to the Sharks in front of a sellout crowd at
Compaq Center on Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "You'd like to be playing well and on a winning note going into
the playoffs," said General Manager Dave Taylor, whose Kings conclude
the regular season today against the Mighty Ducks at Staples Center.
"We come out on the road, knowing that we needed a win or at least a
point to get ourselves a playoff spot and we didn't get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for the Kings, they clinched a playoff berth Friday
when Edmonton was eliminated by a loss to Calgary. But reaching the
playoffs and being successful in them are different matters.</TE>
<TE>   Since March 23, the Kings are 3-5-2. Definitely not the type of
momentum a team wants heading into the playoffs, unless you're the
Detroit Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just not playing as well as we want to," said King
goaltender Felix Potvin, who made 18 saves against the Sharks. "Once
the playoffs start, it's another season, but we know that you can't
just go in there and expect things to turn around."</TE>
<TE>   Although they played with a lot more spunk in the third period
Saturday, the Kings did not attack with the same type of
aggressiveness that made them one of the NHL's most feared teams only
a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   When the Kings are on top of their game, every player on the ice
seems to know where to find a teammate. When one player makes a
mistake, another King is backing him up.</TE>
<TE>   At home, where the Kings are 8-0-2 since March 2, that's how
they've been playing. But on the road, it's been a much different
story.</TE>
<TE>   The one-on-one battles the Kings used to win are now defeats.
Passes that used to go stick-to-stick are now turnovers and shots
that used to find the back of the net are now saves.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a little sloppy on the road right now," winger Adam
Deadmarsh said. "We're not being patient and when you do that, you're
not going to win hockey games very often.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been some scrambling hockey games for us.... We need to work
a little harder. We didn't compete as hard as we would have liked to.
There is a fine line between working hard and competing. We have some
work to do."</TE>
<TE>   With their hopes of gaining home-ice advantage in the first round
a distant memory, the Kings are going to have to win on the road in
the playoffs. And to do that, Murray knows that his team will have to
play better than it did Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Our top-line players were very good in the recent homestand and
they haven't been good enough on the road," Murray said. "They need
to skate faster, shoot quicker and check harder."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings didn't play bad on defense in a scoreless first period
against the Sharks. Potvin had to make only four saves as the Kings
kept San Jose's scoring chances to a minimum. But that all changed in
the second.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to a couple of mistakes made by the Kings in their zone,
the Sharks took a 2-0 lead on goals by Marco Sturm and Scott
Thornton.</TE>
<TE>   On San Jose's first score, two Kings converged on San Jose's
Patrick Marleau, who made a nifty pass to a wide-open Sturm in front
of the net. On the Sharks' second goal, center Mike Ricci's line
dominated the Kings' down low before Thornton scored from in front of
the crease with 51 seconds remaining in the period.</TE>
<TE>   "As a team, we've been giving up more chances like that," Potvin
said. "We just haven't been matching the other team's intensity."</TE>
<TE>   Against Vancouver and San Jose, the Kings did not do a good job
slowing such power forwards as Todd Bertuzzi and Ricci. Which is a
surprise, considering that the Kings have dominated bigger teams this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant coach Mark Hardy said it's been a major disappointment
to see the Kings get beat on effort plays.</TE>
<TE>   "In hockey, you have to win the one-on-one battles and if you're
not prepared to outwork the guy you are working against, then you're
going to lose," Hardy said. "We've played against big guys before....
It has nothing to do with size. We just didn't show up, and that's
not a very good sign."</TE>

<HD>Diamondbacks Win Without Their Aces</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Donnels didn't show any rust when he got a chance for his
fourth at-bat of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Donnels delivered his first hit of the season, a pinch-hit,
two-run triple with two outs in the 10th inning and the Arizona
Diamondbacks defeated the Colorado Rockies, 7-5, Saturday at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "In that situation and without getting a whole lot of at-bats the
last week or so I've just been working hard off the field to keep
some kind of swing out there," said Donnels, a former Dodger who was
hitless in three at-bats before the triple. "The more pitches I saw,
the more comfortable I got, and I was just trying to be aggressive
and get a ball up in the zone to hit hard."</LD>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks won for the first time this season when World
Series co-MVPs Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson did not start.
Arizona is 6-0 when one of its aces pitch, and 1-5 when they do not.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 5, Philadelphia 2--Adam Dunn hit his first home run of
the season, and Joey Hamilton (1-0) made his third consecutive strong
start to lead the Reds at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Red first baseman Sean Casey was briefly hospitalized after being
hit in the side of the head by a pitch from Robert Person (0-2) in
the first inning. Tests were normal, and Casey was released. He is
day-to-day.</TE>
<TE>   Gabe White and Scott Sullivan combined for two scoreless innings
to set up Danny Graves' fifth save in seven chances. The Cincinnati
bullpen has not allowed a run in 191/3 innings over six games.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 5, Atlanta 4--Preston Wilson's broken-bat infield single
with two outs and the bases loaded drove in the winning run in the
14th inning for the Marlins at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson hit a slow roller to third baseman Vinny Castilla, who
tried to bare-hand the ball but failed to come up with it as Mike
Redmond scored from third. Wilson had been 0 for 6 with three
strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Redmond singled with one out in the 14th against Kevin Gryboski
(0-1), making his major league debut. Redmond advanced on a
groundout, and pinch-hitter Andy Fox was intentionally walked--the
fifth intentional walk issued by the Braves. Marty Malloy then walked
to load the bases for Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 9, New York 8--Vladimir Guerrero homered in the 11th
inning and the Expos, after blowing a seven-run lead was primarily
built on shortstop Rey Ordonez's three errors, defeated the Mets at
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Ordonez, a three-time Gold Glove winner, had the worst fielding
day of his career. The Mets made five errors.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero's second homer of the season made a winner of former
Dodger Matt Herges (2-0), who pitched three scoreless innings.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 2, Houston 1--Eli Marrero singled home the winning run
with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning at St. Louis as the
Cardinals extended their winning streak to five.</TE>
<TE>   Houston lost its fourth in a row--wasting a strong effort by Roy
Oswalt, who struck out 10 in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, Chicago 2--Pirate rookie Josh Fogg shut down the
Cubs for the second time in a week, and backup catcher Keith Osik
homered at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Fogg (2-0), who pitched seven shutout innings against the Cubs at
Wrigley Field April 6, gave up three hits and a run in another
seven-inning outing.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Livan Hernandez loves to watch Barry Bonds at the plate just like
everyone else--except the opposition.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody's waiting, every time he's up," Hernandez said. "Is he
going to hit a home run?"</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez doesn't mind the extra run support Bonds provides
either.</LD>
<TE>   Bonds hit his 574th home run, moving past Harmon Killebrew into
sixth place on the career list, and the San Francisco Giants sent the
Milwaukee Brewers to their seventh consecutive loss, 3-2, Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds had tied Killebrew with a home run on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez (3-0), who hadn't won consecutive games in April before
this season, went seven innings and gave up two runs and nine hits.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that so many?" Hernandez defended himself when asked about the
hits. "I care about the win. Win the game. I don't care if it's 29
hits."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' home run, his major league-leading seventh of the season,
came on the first pitch to him in the first inning by Nelson Figueroa
(0-1).</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Martinez had a two-run homer for the Giants, who are off to
a National League-best 9-2 start this season.</TE>
<TE>   Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his third save.</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa came out of the bullpen to make his first start of the
season, taking over because starter Jamey Wright is on the disabled
list because of rotator cuff tendinitis.</TE>
<TE>   After Bonds lofted his homer to right field, Martinez made it 3-0
in the third inning with his second homer of the season. The shot to
the bleachers in left field scored Pedro Feliz, who singled.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers narrowed it to 3-1 in the fourth. Richie Sexson
singled and then scored when Geoff Jenkins tried unsuccessfully to
stretch his double to left-center into a triple.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez got into trouble in the seventh. Raul Casanova doubled,
went to third on Jose Hernandez's single and scored an out later on
Alex Sanchez's single. Jose Hernandez finished three for three with
three singles.</TE>
<TE>   Claimed off waivers by the Brewers on April 3, Figueroa has faced
Bonds only five times in his career, giving up two homers to the
record-breaking slugger.</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa gave up three runs and four hits over six innings on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "He did a real good job," Brewer Manager Davey Lopes said. "He
pitched on two days notice and gave us a real strong performance."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds finished one for two, drawing one walk. He was hit by
Takahito Nomura's pitch in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who hit a record 73 home runs last year, needs nine more to
match Mark McGwire for fifth on the all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants got a scare in the final inning when catcher Benito
Santiago was hit in the right hand as he tried to snag a foul tip
that bounced under him.</TE>
<TE>   Santiago said after the game that the X-rays were negative, but he
would miss today's game.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE HORN ROSS NEWHAN</KH>
<HD>Tigers Can't Get Motor Running</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the Motor City, there ought to be a lemon law to protect fans from
the sputtering Detroit Tigers, who go to work today with an 0-10
record, their worst start since an 0-13 in 1920 and the worst in the
majors since the Chicago Cubs were 0-14 in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   The new dugout team of Manager Luis Pujols and bench coach Felipe
Alou isn't likely to produce any immediate miracles given the lack of
playing talent, but as Dodger Manager Jim Tracy, who coached with
Pujols under Alou in Montreal, put it, making note of the Tigers'
winless record through Friday:</LD>
<LD>   "It's not the most enviable situation for Luis, but he has the
right guy sitting next to him. I can only imagine the number of
insightful things he'll learn from Felipe during the course of a
game. In my four years with Felipe I never saw him miss a pitch. His
knowledge of what's going on 60 feet 6 inches away [the distance
between the mound and home plate] is incredible, and his
understanding of young players and their development is outstanding.
I'm rooting for those guys, and I have every intention to call them
in the next day or so."</LD>
<TE>   Tracy better make it fast.</TE>
<TE>   Instability now characterizes a once-proud franchise that employed
Ty Cobb for 22 years, Al Kaline for 22, Lou Whitaker and Alan
Trammell in the middle of the infield for two decades and Sparky
Anderson as manager for 17 seasons. The Tigers have not had a winning
season since 1993, and Pujols is the fourth manager since Anderson
left in 1995. The fact that Alou, 66, considers Pujols--whose
managerial experience consists of a year at double A and another in
the Dominican Winter League--to be part of his family is probably the
only reason he agreed to join what could be a semi-interim situation.</TE>
<TE>   The respected Dave Dombrowski, recently lured from the Florida
Marlins to become the Tigers' third president in a year, had hoped to
spend the year evaluating the organization before embarking on a
dugout and front-office purge. However, the winless start accelerated
his timetable as the turnstiles at Comerica Park stopped spinning and
Dombrowski sent the message to media and fans that he wasn't going to
let an entire season deteriorate.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Phil Garner and General Manager Randy Smith were fired,
with Pujols moving up from the coaching staff to become manager and
Dombrowski taking on the GM duties--as he would have inevitably done
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Alou, who had interviewed for the Boston Red Sox managing job
before Grady Little was hired, rejected a Detroit offer of two
additional years as assistant to Dombrowski because of his preference
to stay in uniform and possibly manage again--either with the Tigers
or another team. It is unlikely he would step over Pujols' body if
Dombrowski decides Pujols isn't ready or capable of being a big
league manager, but then business is business.</TE>
<TE>   For now, as Tracy said, Alou's developmental skills with young
talent, and his ability to generate an aura of dugout stability and
patience, should be invaluable for an organization going nowhere in
the American League Central's 2002 race and that has no choice but to
focus on development.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't pretend to be familiar with the Detroit situation," Tracy
said, "but I think they have the right people to get the ball rolling
and that it should pick up steam going downhill."</TE>
<TE>   Outclassed</TE>
<TE>   The spring sing coming out of the Angels' camp in Arizona featured
a repetitive chorus: The Angels could contend in the AL West and
close the 41-game gulf that separated them from the Seattle Mariners
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Well, two weeks don't make a season, but the Angels may want to
change the lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Mariners who made an early mark and created new despair
and disparity in Anaheim by sweeping a four-game series that ended
Thursday night. Seattle has won 19 of its last 23 games with the
Angels, including 12 in a row at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   How?</TE>
<TE>   "It's really not complicated," a veteran AL scout said. "Position
by position, the Mariners are simply the better team and by far,
particularly now that Darin Erstad and Tim Salmon appear to have
slipped so badly."</TE>
<TE>   The scout said the Angels have an edge only at third base (Troy
Glaus over Jeff Cirillo) and in left field (Garret Anderson over Mark
McLemore and Ruben Sierra). He said the closers, Troy Percival and
Kazuhiro Sasaki, were a tossup and "both among the best in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "Otherwise Seattle has a huge edge in the bullpen [with Jeff
Nelson, Arthur Rhodes and Shigetoshi Hasegawa], and I still don't
understand why the Angels let Hasegawa leave.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the Mariner rotation," he added, referring to Nos. 1 and 2
Freddy Garcia and Jamie Moyer having gone 38-12 at the front end last
year. "I don't know if [James] Baldwin can replace [Aaron] Sele's 15
wins, but Sele wasn't the same pitcher in the postseason, and
[Mariner General Manager] Pat Gillick seldom makes a bad decision. As
for the rest of it, I don't think it's close."</TE>
<TE>   Hot Air</TE>
<TE>   The science class theory that hot air rises and cold air sinks is
being tested in Bud Selig's $400-million Milwaukee pleasure dome. The
April chill has been entering the park through openings near the
retractable roof track and filtering down to the parka-clad crowd,
overpowering a heating system designed to warm the
multimillion-dollar facility only 30 degrees above outside
temperatures, which have been in the 30s, chilling the Wisconsin
cheese and spectators.</TE>
<TE>   As Randy Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks said during his visit
last week, "This is a nice park and all, don't get me wrong, but I
don't know who is paying the heating bill. If we come here again,
I'll be happy to chip in a little."</TE>
<TE>   Small-market Bud would be appreciative.</TE>

<HD>Clipper Progress Comes Slowly</HD>

<LD>Donald T. Sterling</LD>
<LD>   Sterling World Plaza</LD>
<LD>   Beverly Hills, CA</LD>
<TE>   Dear Donald,</TE>
<TE>   I'm thinking now might be a good time to work on our people
skills, while we still have some people left to try them on....</TE>
<TE>   Let's take your recent run-in with Michael Olowokandi, whom your
guys (not you, they insist) just fined $50,000 for leveling the
shocking allegation that contract worries were affecting Clipper
players.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't the conventional way to open negotiations with a
player who may be able to get $75 million on the market in 2003 ...
which you, of course, will soon try to persuade him to forgo to sign
long-term here.</TE>
<TE>   Your guys say the one had nothing to do with the other, suggesting
that after years of working for you, they inhabit the same parallel
universe you do.</TE>
<TE>   As sharp as you are when you're dealing with land and buildings, I
know you have problems with basketball and people, so let's put it in
more familiar terms. Let's say I own a building at Wilshire and Rodeo
you want. However, before making an offer, you sue me for $50,000,
alleging I cheated you in an earlier deal.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later you ask about my building. The first thing I say
is: "Don, we've got to talk about that 50K you're suing me for. I'm
adding it to the price of my building, multiplied by a factor of,
let's say 100. So the price for anyone else is $100 million ... but
for you we'll call it $105 million.</TE>
<TE>   "And, by the way, go sit on your hat."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, you thought you had a grievance, but suing me called
only more attention to it. Instead, you should have asked yourself,
"What do I care about, his manners or his building?"</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to believe Elgin Baylor levied and rescinded this fine
on his own. He's not the off-with-their-heads type and he dotes on
Olowokandi, having stuck his neck out to draft him and taken heat for
it for three years.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, the situation isn't just flipping out your players,
but the little house of dysfunction you call a front office, too.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper officials, to a man living for the day Olowokandi signs,
recoil in horror--How will we get Donald to pay him $75 million if he
keeps saying these things?--when he speaks out on taboo subjects (in
Clipperdom, nothing is further off-limits than Clipper history) as
he'd begun doing regularly.</TE>
<TE>   It was, indeed, self-serving to complain about the organization
after he made only two of 15 shots in that loss to the Jazz. On the
other hand, truth is a defense and he was right.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just Clipper history that leads your players to wonder
about their futures. You don't do any of the things other teams do as
a matter of course to reassure players.</TE>
<TE>   How about telling the media: "We love this team and when the time
comes, we intend to keep our players."</TE>
<TE>   I forgot, you'd have to talk to the media, first.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor could say it, but he isn't what you'd call unflinching with
the media himself. His only comments on fining and lifting the fine
have come in prepared releases.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, or luckily, for you, Olowokandi still seems to want to
stay. Rescinding the fine was good, although next time, my advice
would be to skip the entire process, punishment, indignation,
forgiveness and reconciliation. If he goes off again between now and
July 1, try this: Kandi Man! We know you had a long day but (wink,
wink) we still love you. How about a hug and a statue of you in front
of the arena in the meantime?</TE>
<TE>   It isn't good that he thought your silence meant, as he noted, "I
was out of here." You've had four years to explain the rules barring
negotiations before July 1; I'd have thought it would have come up by
now.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, ending a nine-day media blackout on the part of
management, Vice President Andy Roeser announced you intend to keep
your players, listing Olowokandi as one of the "top priorities."</TE>
<TE>   Talk about progress.</TE>
<TE>   You have no more faithful retainer than Roeser, who isn't beloved
throughout the organization for it. But I remember Roeser trying to
turn the Danny Manning thing around as the sand ran out of the
hourglass in 1993, offering $25 million--without authorization--when
that was big money for the league and off the charts for you, while
you were in the south of France or somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   This is a new day. No one else has as much size, talent, and
youth, and a payroll so low, you may be able to add another star. Now
you have excitement, profits ... and expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Signing Olowokandi, who was also outspoken enough to say he would
take less to stay, is a no-brainer, as is not giving him a reason to
leave.</TE>
<TE>   So, if anyone thought this season was exciting, wait 'til summer,
or '03, when you have to make a decision on Lamar Odom, and '04, when
Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson are up for extensions.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if you have any questions--other than the usual "What's
he talking about?"--feel free to call.</TE>
<TE>   As ever,</TE>
<TE>   Mark Heisler</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   Padding crowd counts, the NBA way: Soon-to-depart Charlotte Hornet
co-owner Ray Wooldridge acknowledged the team had begun deflating
attendance, counting only paid admissions, omitting no-shows and free
tickets, despite league policy. "That count is erroneous,"
Commissioner David Stern said, directing the Hornets to stop, "but
that doesn't change the fact that there have been enormous losses by
the team in Charlotte." ... The Charlotte Observer, comparing the new
counts to old ones, estimated the Hornets had been knocking off 3,460
a game, more than 15% of their total attendance. This suggests that
as much as 15% of what the NBA lists as "attendance" are really
no-shows and freebies.... Vin Baker, also known as Vin Tin Tin in
Seattle, is now a reserve behind the immortal Predrag Drobjnak and,
despite the SuperSonics' remarkable playoff run, dreaming of leaving.
"I'd love to play in New York," he told the New York Daily News. "It
would be a great situation for me, as well as the Knicks. A low-post
presence is what Latrell [Sprewell] and Allan [Houston] need." Who
does he have in mind? ... Kenyon Martin leaped atop the press table
to celebrate the New Jersey Nets' franchise-record 50th win, which
also clinched the division, and players put on "Atlantic Division
2002 Champions" T-shirts. Unfortunately, the game against the
Washington Wizards missed selling out by 1,500, it looked like 5,000
stayed home because Michael Jordan wasn't playing and perhaps another
5,000 departed early, leaving a half-empty house to cheer the
celebration.... Milwaukee Buck Coach George Karl is telling
confidantes he knows he goofed, insisting they sign Anthony Mason,
who came in late, overweight, couldn't play but, unfortunately, can
still talk. Said Mason last week, as the nose dive continued: "If you
heard the right whispers around, you might feel positive about a
turnaround.... I think we're fooling ourselves. Whether we had great
shooters or not last year, it's not showing up in 2002." The good
news is Mason has only three more years on his contract, worth $14
million.... Timberwolves' guard Chauncey Billups on teammate Kevin
Garnett: "Kevin is a player that believes in his other teammates, but
it's like I tell him, 'At some point, you're our guy, man. We gotta
go through you. At the end of the game, we've got to get the ball to
you. If you miss it, so what? So what? The bottom line is, if I take
it and miss it, if AP [Anthony Peeler] takes it and misses it, if
Felipe [Lopez] takes it and misses it, people are gonna be wondering
why we're taking it. You're the guy.'" ... More fireworks in Utah, or
not: Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan, who is management, for heaven's sake,
noted that upcoming free agency--he has seven players whose deals
will be up--was taking a toll of his team. "There's a lot of pressure
on those players," Sloan said. "I think they sometimes feel they have
to do extraordinary things because of their contracts." ... Sloan
wasn't fined, nor did it become a big story, in Utah or anywhere
else.... Boston's Paul Pierce, after last week's 70-65 win over
Miami: "If you went to the bathroom, you didn't miss nothing."</TE>

<LD>Huntington Beach Edison catcher Cory Vanderhook, a second-team
All-Sunset League selection last season and a three-year starter for
the defending Southern Section Division II champion Charger baseball
team, will be sidelined at least four weeks because of a broken right
hand.</LD>
<LD>   Vanderhook sustained the injury during a 3-1 Sunset League victory
Wednesday against Huntington Beach Marina. The No. 3-ranked Chargers
(13-4, 6-1) lost 1-0 to Marina (12-6, 4-3) on Friday.</LD>

<HD>Felix Puts on a Show at Arcadia Invitational</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Allyson Felix of North Hills L.A. Baptist High didn't get the career
best she was looking for in the 100-meter dash in the Arcadia
Invitational track and field meet at Arcadia High on Saturday night,
but she more than made up for it in the 200.</LD>
<LD>   Felix, the defending state champion in the 100, won that event in
11.54 seconds, the best time in the nation this year, missing her
best by one-hundredth of a second. But her nation-leading time of
23.08 in the 200 crushed her previous best of 23.31 set last year and
moved her into a tie for 10th on the all-time national performer
list.</LD>
<LD>   "It felt pretty fast," said Felix, a junior who flashed a huge
smile when informed of her time. "Right before the race, my coach and
I talked about trying to run fast and staying relaxed."</LD>
<TE>   Felix, runner-up in the 200 in the state championships last year,
ran a strong turn in the event and then powered away from the field
in the homestretch as sophomore Jasmine Lee of Long Beach Poly
finished second in 24.09.</TE>
<TE>   Felix, who was selected the girls' athlete of the meet after
winning the 100 and 200 for the second year in a row, won the 100 by
nearly three-tenths of a second as Long Beach Poly sophomore Shalonda
Solomon was second in 11.82.</TE>
<TE>   Zenobia Reed of Lamar (Texas) was expected to be Felix's top rival
in the 100, but her coach told meet organizers Wednesday that she
wouldn't be making the trip because she recently revealed to him that
she had a fear of flying.</TE>
<TE>   Kaylene Wagner of Goleta Dos Pueblos and Michelle Sanford of
Irvine Woodbridge also turned in nation-leading marks. Wagner, a
senior, cleared 6 feet in the high jump to defeat defending state
champion Chaunte Howard of Riverside North and move into a three-way
tie for first on the national list. Sanford, a junior, won the triple
jump with a 41-foot 9-inch effort that wrested the national lead from
Howard, who had bounded 41-3 to defeat Sanford in the Pasadena Games
at Pasadena City College on March 30.</TE>
<TE>   In the boys' meet, Long Beach Poly turned in a state-leading 40.96
in the 400 relay and a nation-leading 3:13.30 in the 1,600 relay.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Noah Bryant of Carpinteria won the boys' shotput with a
state-leading 65-11 and Travis Patterson of Simi Valley Royal was an
upset winner in the boys' 800 with a state-leading time of 1:53.69.</TE>
<TE>   John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   At the Mission Viejo swimming invitational:</TE>
<TE>   Irvine wins girls' title--Sophomore Courtney Cashion won the 50
and 100 freestyles to lead Irvine to the team championship at the
Marguerite Recreation Center.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine scored 422.5 points to edge defending meet champion Moraga
Campolindo (411.5). Cashion won the 50 freestyle in a region-leading
23.83 seconds, defeating UCLA-bound Kim Vandenberg of Campolindo
(24.03). Cashion came back to win the 100 freestyle in 51.10,
bettering her region-leading mark by nearly a second.</TE>
<TE>   The Vaqueros also won the 200 medley (1:46.73) and 400 freestyle
relays (3:32.63), senior Flora Kong won the 100 butterfly (56.78),
freshman Jane Hwang won the 200 individual medley (2:08.83) and
sophomore Diana MacManus won the 100 backstroke (55.60).</TE>
<TE>   Campolindo won seven of 11 events and totaled 470 points to easily
win the boys' team title. Paul Frankenberger won the 100 freestyle in
49.40 and Sean Boyle won the 200 freestyle in 1:46.99 to lead
Murrieta Valley to fourth place, the top finish among Southland
teams.</TE>
<TE>   In baseball:</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth 9, L.A. Marshall 2--Justin Cassel (7-0) struck out nine
in six innings and Jason Dominguez had four hits, including a
three-run home run and a two-run double, to lead No. 1 Chatsworth
(17-0) to the pool-play victory in the Chatsworth tournament.</TE>
<TE>   In boys' golf:</TE>
<TE>   Joe Berry Junior Masters tournament--San Marcos, the No. 1 team in
The Times' rankings, shot a tournament-record 359 on the second day
of competition to defeat Carmichael Jesuit, 738-748, in the
prestigious event at Ancil Hoffman Golf Course. The Lions' 738 was
also a tournament record. San Marcos was led by Kevin Larsen and
Collin Lee, who each shot one-over-par 74-71--145 to tie for second.
Mike Ostrich of Sacramento Rio Americano was medalist at 144. Palm
Desert finished fourth at 752, led by Brian Mahoney and Sean Meier,
who each shot 146.</TE>

<DH>Spectators Delight to the Roar of Engines and the
Atmosphere at Grand Prix of Long Beach</DH>

<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the freeway transition from the 405 to the 710, headed to Long
Beach, if you open the car window you can smell it: the mix of oil
and fuel, fumes to some, perfume to most of the several hundred
thousand people who will drive, bike, skateboard or walk to the
Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   On Ocean Boulevard, at least five blocks from the race course, the
pavement transfers a shuddering, thundering, rumbling sense to your
feet. The power of the machines is coursing through the streets and
moves from the toes through the stomach to the head.</LD>
<LD>   Four blocks away and the ear drums begin to quiver. Buy the ear
plugs. If you're looking for advice on what to do, how to attend the
Grand Prix, item No.1: Buy the ear plugs. The plugs cost $1 outside
the course, $2 after you've gone through the gate.</LD>
<TE>   Two blocks away and all sense of self is gone. The race cars,
brightly colored green ones, yellow ones, red ones, have taken over.
They are on the road course, warming up, taking practice laps and it
is a dilemma: Put in the ear plugs and remove yourself from the
essence of the weekend or throw caution to the wind, take out the
plugs and to heck with hearing for the next week or two.</TE>
<TE>   "What?" asks Bruce Flanders, voice of the Grand Prix as he calls
himself, track announcer and unabashed fan of the pageantry of the
event. Flanders says "what?" a lot. He doesn't wear ear plugs, hasn't
since he started calling the races here in 1978 when the track ran
Formula One. Flanders, 56, is part of the racing. He holds a
three-day conversation with the fans. He talks, they scream answers
across the track. He tells a joke, they laugh. "Or," Flanders says,
"they throw things. Then I know the joke wasn't funny."</TE>
<TE>   The Grand Prix of Long Beach is like that. Short on formality but
full of tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Going to the Yard House, standing in line and waiting for a green
wrist band giving you permission to enter and drink margaritas and
scream over the rumble of the engines and the magnified voice of
Flanders, is a tradition. If your timing is perfect, you make it to
the Yard House on Saturday after the celebrity race is finished and
before the CART drivers, the headliners, take to the track for
qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend is about being able to buy a cigar at the Cuban Cigar
Store, then taking three steps to the right and buying a Brazilian
bikini, in the pattern of the black-and-white checkered flag, at the
RaceGirl tent.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the Masters, boys and girls. This is not the place to
try to find out who's leading the Masters. This is where a properly
proportioned woman wears a tight white shirt with the word
"Dangerous" spelled in silver sparkles across her chest. "I ran out
of stuff to spell 'curves,'" the woman giggles, and what stuff she
ran out of, who can be sure?</TE>
<TE>   The weekend isn't only about the Hooters Girls wandering through
the paddock, which is where all the racers and their crews have their
work areas, and causing mechanics to drop their tools to have a photo
taken with the girls.</TE>
<TE>   Women also are at work in these shiny-clean trailers. Nadine
Haupt, 30, has a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from
Purdue and a master's degree in the same field from Oakland
University. She is the track support engineer for Ford-Cosworth. She
is working with rookie driver Mario Dominguez, who is in his second
CART race.</TE>
<TE>   Haupt, who has bright red hair and freckles, walks past the
Hooters Girls and the women offering their chests for drivers to
autograph and explains how she hooks up a laptop and can tell in a
minute whether Dominguez's engine is offering enough power and
whether the car is behaving as it should over the changing
pavement--from concrete to asphalt and back to concrete.</TE>
<TE>   Haupt realized her love of the internal combustion engine and of
what the engine could do to a car when she had a Chrysler internship
and worked on the development of the Viper.</TE>
<TE>   Now she drives a black Porsche 911 from her home in Venice to the
office in Torrance. Haupt knows cars.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Anderson knows what the Grand Prix of Long Beach is about.
Anderson, a 39-year-old aerospace engineer from Redondo Beach, is
attending his 15th consecutive Grand Prix. He gets a block of rooms
at the Super 8 at the traffic circle and every year more and more of
his friends come along for the ride and for the party.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the carnival atmosphere," Anderson says. "It's the eye
candy, it's the party at the Yard House.</TE>
<TE>   "But more than that, it's these incredible athletes. It is so
physically and mentally challenging driving these cars with these
engines for two hours. I've gotten so much into the racing that I do
some myself."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson has a Toyota Celica, a Viper, a Shelby GCHS and a Ford
Bronco. He doesn't race the Bronco and he has to go now. For a beer,
for a look at the women, for a sniff of the perfume, Chanel mixed
with fuel, for the shudder of the engine and the parties to come.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Holmberg validated his new No. 1 ranking in the world and on
the Swedish Match Tour by winning his fourth Congressional Cup in
five years Saturday, but not before Gavin Brady had him twisting in
the wind.</LD>
<LD>   "I sweated more in that race than in any other final," Holmberg
said after dispatching Brady, 2-1, in a fickle dying breeze. "It's
tough on the nerves."</LD>
<LD>   For the second successive year Holmberg spotted his opponent the
first race of the championship finals before firing back to win the
next two and another Crimson Blazer, emblematic of victory in the
38-year-old match-race sailing classic staged by the Long Beach Yacht
Club. Last year it was France's Bertrand Pace in a nautical slugfest;
this time it was a war of nerves against a young but formidable
two-time winner of the event.</LD>
<TE>   For the first few minutes the race looked like a rout, but a
sudden wind shift in Brady's favor made it a contest to the finish.</TE>
<TE>   Holmberg, who collected $6,000 of the $25,000 purse, is from the
U.S. Virgin Islands, but his home these days is wherever there is
match racing to be done or an America's Cup to win. He came to town
ranked No. 1 after winning the previous two events on the
international Swedish Match Tour. Except for a three-race slump at
the start of the second round, he and his crew from billionaire Larry
Ellison's Oracle Racing campaign resoundingly validated that status
by breezing through the double round robin with 15 victories in 18
races.</TE>
<TE>   Then they fought off Britain's Andy Green in the semifinals, 2-1,
before dispatching Brady by the same score. Holmberg, 40, thus joined
Rod Davis as a four-time winner, but this may have been the strongest
field either of them ever faced in their victories. They were two of
seven competitors from America's Cup teams who will be facing off
again in New Zealand in October.</TE>
<TE>   Brady, 29, is a native of New Zealand who lives in Annapolis, Md.,
and sails with Davis for Prada. A winner here in 1996 and '97, he
reached the finals by winning six of his last seven races, including
a 2-0 sweep of Team Dennis Conner's Ken Read in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Said Holmberg of Brady: "Gavin made us work real hard. To win this
one is huge."</TE>

<LD>I'm probably the happiest guy in Los Angeles because of the Dodgers'
improved play, and the chance it affords me now to write a more
positive column.</LD>
<LD>   That has been a goal of mine for almost two years.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes I get so mad at myself for the crummy things I write
about the Dodgers I just want to e-mail me and tell me where to go,
but it seems as though someone always beats me to it.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers' rebound from that 0-3 start, however, has saved me
from myself. In fact, I'm almost embarrassed to say that if the Big
Goofs had continued to lose, I probably would have called Jim
Esterbrooks, that San Diego Padre fan who got into it with Dodger Boy
a year ago to this day, just to make sure he knew what Dan Evans
looked like this weekend at Qualcomm Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so I did call him. But I never sent the picture of the
Dodgers' new general manager. All I told the guy was to look for
someone who appears clueless, and if Esterbrooks picks Evans out of
the crowd, I'll be really surprised, what with all the Charger fans
down there who probably also go to baseball games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LAST WEEK the Padres had Esterbrooks throw out the ceremonial
first pitch before one of their games. I'm surprised the Dodgers
didn't think of that.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago he was sitting in Section 29 with his son and wife
behind home plate in Qualcomm Stadium and heckling Gary Sheffield,
making him no different than most Dodger fans, when Dodger GM Kevin
Malone took exception. Words were exchanged, Malone challenged
Esterbrooks to fight, and a few days later Malone was no longer the
GM of the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, as a Padres fan the last thing I really wanted to do
was have Malone go away," said Esterbrooks, who threw out the first
pitch because of his community involvement and work with the San
Diego County Office of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Esterbrooks was back Saturday and behind home plate for the second
game of the Dodger-Padre series, and I swear to you he did not make
faces at Terry Mulholland just because of me. He said he thought of
it himself before I suggested it or begged him to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "The Padres will finish higher this year; the Dodgers will finish
fourth," Esterbrooks said. "L.A. has a $40-million team with a
$100-million payroll."</TE>
<TE>   I hear something like that, of course, in my new position as
positive columnist and I understand why Malone wanted to pop the guy.
But I guess all I can do is lead by example in this space, and when
people make fun of our slugs Eric Karros and Chad Kreuter, just
defend them to the best of my ability.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Karros is batting (.290) more than he weighs (216)
right now, and I can't remember the last April when that happened.
This also gives him incentive to keep his weight down. As for
Kreuter, I don't care what anyone says, I'm a firm believer he will
get a hit this season.</TE>
<TE>   You know, I kind of like this new positive approach to our crummy
teams--I can't wait to try it with USC this fall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WOULD understand if my wife was doing the home cooking: Before
Saturday night's game against Oakland, the Angels had compiled a 2-18
record in their last 20 games at Edison Field extending into last
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MAYBE IT'S just time for a pep talk: The Angels have compiled a
12-36 mark since the organization extended Manager Mike Scioscia's
contract and guaranteed his pay through 2005.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE WAS more than $2 million on the line Friday for the pick six
at Santa Anita and if you sought help in the paper from our expert
picker in Bob Mieszerski--he went 0 for 6. And yet in his Insider
Trading box in Saturday's paper, under the category, "Who's Not" hot,
Misery listed jockey Jorge Chavez, because he has had only one winner
in his last 14 mounts. At least he had a winner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE LOS ANGELES Amazons, an expansion team in the Women's
Professional Football League, conducted tryouts Saturday. They found
a 5-foot-7 quarterback for the full contact tackle team that begins
play Aug. 3, but they still don't have an answer for a New England
offensive tackle, who stands 6-4 and weighs 340.</TE>
<TE>   I told Amazon owner Gale Hulett I'd talk to some of my wife's
cousins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TELL ME if you can identify the celebrities on the following list:
Bob Cuomo, Dule Hill, Patrick Warburton, Vic Seper and Patrick
Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   I mention this, because I gave some thought to covering the
Pro/Celebrity Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach race Saturday, but I
had never heard of these so-called famous people. Now if you think
you know Cuomo or Seper, shame on you. They take up space in our
sports department and are famous only for eating a lot.</TE>
<TE>   I will say this, our editor in control Saturday night, Claire
Noland, swooned when I mentioned Stewart was in the area. She said
she had been in an elevator with him. I thought maybe she was
confused, and thought I was talking about Larry Stewart, our TV/radio
columnist, but before I could say anything, she said, "One of the
Sexiest Men in People magazine, and if he wasn't he should have
been."</TE>
<TE>   I still have no idea if we were talking about Patrick or Larry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Nancy Mellen:</TE>
<TE>   "You wrote about bad golfers, and said they were worse than
anyone, and 'that includes Dwyre and the women I've watched play.' If
you wrote that same sentence and substituted blacks, Jews, Hispanics,
gays, etc., where the word 'women' appears, you'd be fired so fast
your head would be spinning."</TE>
<TE>   Those good people can play golf, so they don't fit in that
sentence.</TE>

<DH>Alhambra High's Humberto Ramirez Devotes Time to Baseball,
Not Gangs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joining a gang would be easy for Humberto Ramirez, who has lived in
an East Los Angeles housing project for 14 of his 17 years.</LD>
<LD>   Every day, he must make decisions that could compromise his
future.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of my close friends recently got into a gang and they
really don't have a life anymore," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Ramirez has always chosen baseball over gangs. Since the time his
father would take him to a park to hit him ground balls, baseball has
been his No. 1 priority.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the game," he said. "I've been doing it almost all my
life."</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez, 5 feet 9 and 160 pounds, is a three-year varsity starter
at Alhambra High. His coach, Steve Gewecke, calls him the best
fielding third baseman he has worked with in 11 years of coaching.</TE>
<TE>   But pitching is the skill Ramirez has mastered this season. Last
week against Montebello Schurr, Ramirez (5-1) struck out 12 in eight
innings and dropped his earned-run average to 0.38. He's walked only
three in 37 innings for Alhambra (10-6, 5-2).</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez is one of six children born to Maria and Rafael Ramirez,
who immigrated from Mexico when they were in their 20s. Oldest
brother Jovan was a three-year varsity starter at Alhambra. Youngest
brother Noel, 12, is a shortstop and pitcher who could be the best
player in the family.</TE>
<TE>   Gang members know not to bother the Ramirez brothers because
they're into sports.</TE>
<TE>   "I show them the newspapers," Ramirez said. "They say, 'Good job,
be one of the first ones out of the housing projects.' "</TE>
<TE>   But there are temptations and safety issues that Ramirez must deal
with daily.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom didn't want us heading in the wrong direction," he said.
"She had a long talk with me. She told me she had a lot of trust in
me to make the right decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping busy in school, in athletics and on weekends as an
Explorer with the Pasadena Fire Department helps Ramirez stay out of
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   He spends alternate Saturdays training and learning about the fire
department.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like a good career," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez needs to keep improving his grades to have a chance to
play baseball in college, but there are lessons he has learned that
should allow him to make the right choices.</TE>
<TE>   "About two years ago, one of my closest friends got in [a gang],
and he's not around," Ramirez said. "I think he's up north just
hiding from stuff. It's not good. You always have to be worried and I
don't want to deal with that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Conor Jackson, a two-time All-City infielder at Woodland Hills El
Camino Real High, has become one of the top hitters in the Pacific 10
Conference in his sophomore season at California.</TE>
<TE>   He's batting .387 with 11 home runs and 42 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   But most intriguing about Jackson is how college life has changed
him--something high school athletes should ponder.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was a good student at El Camino Real, but nothing like the
3.9 grade-point average he compiled last semester at California that
put him on the dean's list.</TE>
<TE>   He used to tease his father, John, who co-stars on the CBS drama,
"JAG," about acting. Jackson rarely watched the series and seemed to
have little interest in acting.</TE>
<TE>   His one acting experience came in seventh grade when he was an
extra for a commercial about Universal Studios' Back to the Future
ride. He didn't like the work.</TE>
<TE>   "I rode that ride, I swear, 20 times," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So his family and friends must have been in shock when Jackson
declared his college major this year--theater and performance
studies.</TE>
<TE>   Everything changed after Jackson took an acting class.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He has even asked his father about suggestions for scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish him all the luck in the world," John said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was a 31st-round draft choice of the Cleveland Indians out
of high school, but he couldn't be happier with his college
experience.</TE>
<TE>   It has allowed him to explore interests he might never have
discovered.</TE>
<TE>   He still wants to be a major leaguer, but he'll also be
well-trained to star in a shaving commercial.</TE>

<HD>Unraveling a Secret Life</HD>
<DH>A marriage becomes an unexpected mystery in 'The Pilot's
Wife.' The best-selling novel is now a CBS movie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CBS originally planned to show its TV movie "The Pilot's Wife" on
Sept. 30 last year. But after the tragedy of Sept. 11, the network
pulled the drama based on Anita Shreve's bestseller because it deals
with a woman whose husband dies in a plane crash. Seven months after
the terrorist attacks, "The Pilot's Wife" is finally ready to take
flight.</LD>
<LD>   Executive producer Stephanie Germain never worried that the film
would be grounded permanently. "It didn't appear appropriate at the
time," she says, "but the movie stands on its own, and [I knew] it
would have its time."</LD>
<LD>   Christine Lahti plays the title character in "The Pilot's
Wife"--Kathryn Lyons, a happily married woman with a precocious
teenage daughter (Alison Pill). Her world is turned on its head after
her husband, Jack (John Heard), is killed in a mysterious plane crash
off the coast of Ireland and she learns that he was leading a double
life. She then travels to London and Ireland to find the truth behind
the crash.</LD>
<TE>   A selection of Oprah Winfrey's book club, "The Pilot's Wife" was a
critical and commercial success three years ago. Germain believes the
story holds appeal for "every adult out there in any kind of
relationship, married or not, because it has to do with: Do you ever
really know the other person? It is so incredibly relatable. I think
that's what drew such a huge readership."</TE>
<TE>   Neither director Robert Markowitz nor his wife, screenwriter
Christine Berardo, had read the novel before joining the project.
Navigating the story to the small screen was difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "The novel is structured so that every other chapter is a
flashback to reveal the marriage," says Berardo. "To get all of that
back story in and not to do just lengthy flashbacks or have her talk
was the challenge. It was great for me that we both started working
at the same time. Robert could make directorial suggestions, and I
was able to take some of his ideas and just run with it." (Shreve
wrote an early draft of the script, which wasn't used. She still
shares writing credit with Berardo.)</TE>
<TE>   Markowitz and Berardo decided to use flashbacks to slowly reveal
the truth behind Kathryn's relationship with Jack--"to tell the story
from both outside Kathryn and to see what was happening in her head,
switching back and forth," Berardo says. "Sometimes you are in
fantasy time with her. It was great material to work with because the
book is so rich.... Anita's dialogue in the book is just sensational,
and I used as much of that as I could."</TE>
<TE>   Because the film deals so extensively with memory, Markowitz
acknowledges that "The Pilot's Wife" is unusual network fare. "We
went to CBS early to let them know it was going to be done in an
unconventional way," he says. "It's no secret CBS is trying to
increase their audience, so they wanted the film to have an edge to
it. They really embraced this technique. It's not just bookended
flashbacks. When we were working on it, we felt these pieces of
memory were like shards of memory, and the memory becomes discovery
for her."</TE>
<TE>   Lahti was also involved in shaping the script and her character.
Because of the actress' input, Kathryn is less passive than in the
novel.</TE>
<TE>   "It was ... [my] and the writers' and Robert's intention not to
make her a victim," says Lahti. "I feel like in very rare cases there
are no victims, just volunteers."</TE>
<TE>   Because Kathryn's parents died when she was young, says Lahti, she
never wanted to rock the boat with her husband. "She is so in
denial," says Lahti. "I think one of the things her daughter taught
her was to stop pretending, just look at what's really going on.
That's one of the blessings of this tragedy in Kathryn's life. She
sort of came of age in the middle of her life and got to be a
grown-up and really started looking at things as they really were."</TE>
<TE>   "The Pilot's Wife" can be seen Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS. The
network has rated it TV-14-D-L-S (may be inappropriate for children
under 14, with advisories for suggestive dialogue, coarse language
and sex).</TE>

<HD>A Homebody Whose Dances Travel Well</HD>
<DH>Paul Taylor likes to stay put when his company hits the
road.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Choreographer Paul Taylor has been at the forefront of modern dance
for nearly five decades, and at age 71, this veteran figure, who
admits to still smoking up to three packs of cigarettes a day, has no
plans to retire. Although he stopped touring with his New York-based
Paul Taylor Dance Company years ago, he is still the guiding force
behind the troupe that has been to more than 450 cities in 60
countries.</LD>
<LD>   His list of awards, honors and accomplishments rivals the
thickness of a phone book, including three Guggenheim Fellowships, a
MacArthur Fellowship, a 1992 Emmy for the televised version of his
dance "Speaking in Tongues" and the National Medal of Arts, presented
to him by President Clinton in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   But at the heart of everything is Taylor's work: At last count, he
has created more than 115 dances for the company he founded in 1956,
including the classics "Aureole," "Esplanade" and "Company B."
Newsweek called him the world's greatest living choreographer.</LD>
<TE>   Not bad for a boy from Washington who didn't start dancing until
he reached college, where he exchanged an interest in art for dance.
Taylor then went to New York City to study dance at Juilliard and
joined the Martha Graham Dance Company, where he performed as a
soloist. The rest, as they say, is dance history.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, a bit of a recluse, has had a house on Long Island's north
shore for more than 35 years, a place where, he says, many of his
neighbors don't know who he is or what he does.</TE>
<TE>   Life there, with his dog, bird and, at one time, a pet pig named
Sugar, includes gardening, reading and listening to music. Oh, yes:
Taylor also cooks up ideas for dances there.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the company completed a five-year residency at
Glendale's Alex Theatre, and Taylor is in talks with the Music Center
to come to the heart of Los Angeles beginning in June 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, fans of this iconic choreographer will have to make
the trip to the UC Santa Barbara, where his 16-person group performs
a trio of Taylor pieces, including two favorites--"Arden Court" and
"Piazzolla Caldera"--and a work new to Southern California, "The
Word" (1988). Talking by phone from his seaside home, Taylor
discussed his company's upcoming performance.</TE>
<TE>   Question: When you abandoned painting for dance, did you ever
dream you would have a company that would still be going strong
nearly 50 years later?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: No. I wanted to be a painter, but I didn't think that was
such a hot idea [because] I doubted I [would] be very good. I
discovered modern dance, and that seemed like a better idea. I never
intended to be a choreographer. I just wanted to be a dancer and let
somebody else tell me what to do. [He laughs.]</TE>
<TE>   Q: The company tours 30 to 35 weeks a year. How do you decide what
dances to tour and why did you stop traveling with the company?</TE>
<TE>   A: I stopped dancing years ago, and there wasn't anything for me
to do on the road anymore. I had a 20-year run, so it was about time,
I thought. I try to make balanced programs and these pieces just
happen to be in this year's repertory.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you think is the continued appeal of "Arden Court," a
dance you made in 1981?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's a happy dance. There's nothing abrasive about it. The
movement, of course, it always goes back to the steps themselves and
how the dancers perform. I think the company should get a lot of
credit when people like my pieces. I figure if I make the dances
really right, nobody notices the choreography--they're looking at the
people.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Martha Graham once said, "The body doesn't lie." Is this an
operating premise for you as well?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think the body does lie. We have to have a lot of artifice in
theater. If you look at animals--and we're descended from
them--they're very cagey. Their bodies sometimes do tricky stuff,
pretending they feel one way when they actually feel another way.
That happens in dance.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Let's talk about "The Word," with its commissioned score by
Leonard Bernstein protege David Israel. It's somewhat religious in
tone--dealing with schoolboys in uniform, hazing and acceptance. Why
did you bring it back? What was the work's inspiration?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's just a general idea I have about organized religion. I'm
an atheist. Or a lapsed Episcopalian. I had talked to David, and we
had been going up to [New York's] Met Museum and looking at old
Byzantine art. But the piece doesn't look Byzantium. We didn't dress
it that way. The designer [Santo Loquasto] decided to dress them all
alike--like automatons.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are you trying to say in this piece--beware of conformity,
hypocrisy, an overly puritanical society?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm a little leery of stating my message for each piece,
because in a way it seems like cheating. If the dance isn't
meaningful in some way to the people that watch it, then it failed. I
think of dance as a communication, [but] I like to leave things up to
the people that watch.</TE>
<TE>   Q: A lot of ballet companies have embraced and licensed your work,
beginning in 1968 when "Aureole" first entered the repertory of the
Royal Danish Ballet. Last year, American Ballet Theatre performed
"Black Tuesday," a piece you set to Depression-era songs, yet you
have said flat out that you don't like working with ballet companies.
Why?</TE>
<TE>   A: A lot of my pieces have gone to ballet companies [but] there
aren't that many commissions. I did early on make a dance directly on
ballet dancers. It was such a horrible experience, I didn't want to
do it again. The movement vocabulary of modern is very different than
ballet [although] ballet dancers have gotten a lot bigger range
[recently]. I just like to work with my own people. We get so we can
read each others' minds; things go much faster. It seems like a good
idea to make the piece at home and [then] have it taught to the other
people.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You like to stick close to home and putter. What about checking
out other choreographers? Whose work do you admire? And knowing
you've got another home in Manhattan, as well as your dance studio,
do you get to the theater much?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't go anywhere much. I just stay put. I don't go to the
theater, because [in] plays all they do is talk. Often, they just
yell at each other. I like [choreographers] Susan Marshall and Mark
Morris. I think he isn't bad. If an ex-dancer of mine is
performing--and a lot of them have formed their own companies over
the years--David Parsons, Pina Bausch--I make an effort to go see
that, because they're like family.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Since you don't dance anymore, how do you stay in shape?</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, I don't exercise. No yoga or calisthenics [either]. Even
when I was dancing, I hardly ever warmed up. I've been blessed with a
body that seems to hold together. Besides, just working around the
house keeps me moving [and] gardening is wonderful for your back.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you see modern dance faring in the new century?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's always changing. Young people come along, they do their
thing. Others come along and they haven't seen the first gang, so
they do it too--[re-]inventing the wheel. But I feel optimistic. I
don't think modern dance is going to go away.</TE>
<TE>   Q: And how about you in the new century? How do you remain
unjaded, fresh, inspired?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't know how inspired I am. I'm a worker; it's my job. But
I do trust my imagination.</TE>

<HD>For Bush, Message Is the Home Front</HD>
<DH>Politics: Quick trips and fund-raisers are linchpin of White
House's bid to help GOP in midterms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush is devoting unprecedented attention to the Middle
East, as well as pressing ahead with the war on terrorism. But with an
eye toward November's congressional elections and his own 2004 reelection
bid, he is devoting no less energy to his largely dormant domestic
agenda.</LD>
<LD>   Since February, Bush has spent about two days each week traveling
around the country to promote causes ranging from greater volunteerism to
expansion of Head Start.</LD>
<LD>   His more ambitious proposals, such as further tax cuts and drilling
for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--are unlikely to be
realized in the closely divided Congress. Others are narrow in scope.</LD>
<TE>   Yet there's method in his tireless promotion of these issues.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush will demonstrate during a visit Monday to Cedar Rapids,
Iowa--where he plans to speak about the economy and tax cuts before
attending a Republican fund-raiser--such dual-purpose trips, which
usually take up much of a day, are the linchpin of the White House
strategy for recapturing the Senate, enlarging the six-vote Republican
margin in the House and sharpening Bush's differences with Democrats for
the 2004 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the approach bodes well for the GOP, at least by one measure:
Bush is raising an average of $1 million a week for Republican candidates
and the party.</TE>
<TE>   But the strategy is not without risks.</TE>
<TE>   As the president increasingly engages in partisan politics--and touts
issues that may lack majority support--his popularity could slip from its
post-Sept. 11 highs, an erosion that already has begun. A Wall Street
Journal/NBC News poll earlier this month found that 74% approve of his
performance--down from 82% in January.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a natural deterioration over time in any president's ratings,
absent boosting events, and some of that has happened," University of
Virginia political analyst Larry J. Sabato said.</TE>
<TE>   "But mainly, Bush has now lost most of his momentum because events
seem to be driving him, rather than Bush driving events."</TE>
<TE>   Also behind the president's domestic push is his determination to
avoid the mistakes of his father, the 41st president, who was denied a
second term after winning the Persian Gulf War because voters thought he
was not attuned to pocketbook concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Thus it's no accident that Bush has sought to avoid accusations of
neglecting domestic issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Sooner or later, we are going to get back to some domestic issues.
And he's talking about them now because he doesn't want people later to
say that there's no agenda," said Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst
here.</TE>
<TE>   But only time will tell whether the issues Bush is advocating will
resonate with voters. As one Republican strategist conceded of Bush's
plan: "It's all defensive; no offense."</TE>
<TE>   The president's devotion to domestic issues, especially in recent
weeks, has produced some jarring images--of Bush in the heartlands
stubbornly promoting volunteerism, for instance, while pictures of the
latest Middle East violence flash across the split television screen.</TE>
<TE>   That juxtaposition seems odd because of the relative insignificance of
Bush's topic of the day compared to issues of life and death, and war and
peace, Rothenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush is unlikely to alter his strategy. Even after deciding to
insert his administration squarely into the Middle East crisis by
dispatching Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to the region, the
president made two consecutive day trips last week--to Knoxville, Tenn.,
on Monday and to Bridgeport, Conn., the next day--to promote volunteerism
and raise money for the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing an auditorium teeming with volunteer workers in Bridgeport,
Bush sounded like a salesman, aggressively touting his USA Freedom Corps;
at one point he blurted out the program's toll-free number and its Web
address.</TE>
<TE>   In his weekly radio address Saturday, the president called on Congress
to make permanent his $1.3-trillion, 10-year tax cut, adding: "When it
comes to tax relief, once is not enough."</TE>
<TE>   The tax cut was Bush's central campaign pledge, and he is not about to
let voters forget a promise kept.</TE>
<TE>   "Tax relief is a crucial part of my administration's overall economic
growth agenda, to create more high-paying jobs," the president said in
his radio remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to great lengths at the White House to try not to make
the same mistakes as Dad did," political analyst Charles Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his top aides also have not been reluctant to put public
pressure on the Senate, which Democrats control by a single vote. On the
chamber's plate are an array of Bush priorities already adopted by the
GOP-controlled House, including a faith-based initiative, enhanced trade
authority for the president, a ban on human cloning and an energy bill
that would open ANWR to gas and oil exploration.</TE>
<TE>   The underlying message is simple: give Bush a working majority in both
houses and his agenda will get done.</TE>
<TE>   One administration official expressed the belief, widely shared in the
West Wing, that Bush's personal popularity is prompting voters to give
his initiatives a second look, including some who backed Democrat Al Gore
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The president's agenda is going over "a lot better outside of
Washington," asserted a senior White House official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "Ronald Reagan scaled back our expectations of what the federal
government can and should do," a trend that former President Bush
perpetuated, Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Clinton, in contrast, began his first term with huge aspirations,
most notably his controversial and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to
revamp the health-care system.</TE>
<TE>   "That reminded us of why presidents shouldn't try to do big things,"
Cook added.</TE>
<TE>   "So George Bush is sticking to a tried-and-true recipe."</TE>

<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE
</DL>
<LD>An archbishop who established a model program for handling sexual
abuse by clergy transferred a priest who was a known sex offender from
one parish to another in 1979 and did not remove him until 1992,
according to documents unsealed by a judge.</LD>
<LD>   Archbishop Rembert Weakland, head of the Roman Catholic archdiocese
here, said in a sworn deposition that he "didn't think it should be
divulged" to the new parish that the priest had molested two children.</LD>
<LD>   Weakland is widely considered one of the church's most liberal leaders
concerning economic and social issues. He established a program 14 years
ago that has been lauded as an example of how dioceses should reach out
to victims and swiftly deal with perpetrators of sexual abuse.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>A top U.S. bishop said Saturday that Pope John Paul II has been
"deeply touched" by the suffering surrounding allegations of sexual abuse
by American priests. But the pontiff did not discuss calls for the
resignation of Boston Cardinal Bernard Law.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Wilton Gregory, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops, said John Paul expressed his support for the U.S. church during
a week of talks at the Vatican, where Gregory said the abuse allegations
were a central issue.</LD>
<LD>   The talks between the pontiff and a delegation of American bishops,
held semi-annually, came as the U.S. church faces charges that it failed
to respond appropriately to charges of sexual misconduct by priests.</LD>
<TE>   "Given the level of anxiety and anguish, this has touched him deeply,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory said there was no discussion of Law, who has acknowledged that
he transferred a priest to another parish despite knowing of sexual
misconduct allegations against the man.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory said U.S. bishops would try to come up with a common policy to
deal with sex-abuse allegations during a June meeting.</TE>

<HD>No Easy Solution to Priest Problem</HD>
<DH>* Scandal: It's not just celibacy policy, or homosexuality, or
secrecy behind crisis. But all three play a role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sexual-abuse scandal rocking the Roman Catholic Church in the
U.S. has prompted calls for reforms that often blame the crisis on a
single issue: Celibacy. Or homosexuality. Or secrecy. Or imperious
bishops.</LD>
<LD>   But what has made this scandal more intense and prolonged than its
predecessors is the complex way each of these issues interlock.</LD>
<LD>   The complexity explains why the scandal has outraged and energized
such a wide range of church constituencies: Liberal Catholics believe the
church can be healed by permitting married priests and the ordination of
women. Ardent traditionalists who link homosexuality to sexual abuse see
the scandal as a sign that the church must return to a holiness grounded
in fealty to traditional teachings. Still others call for a
democratization of the church so that bishops, who answer only to Pope
John Paul II, will be held accountable by their dioceses.</LD>
<TE>   "We've had so much institutional culture shock that the deeper
[question] is where to go from here," said Dennis Doyle, a church
historian and professor at the University of Dayton in Ohio, founded by
the Marianist teacher order.</TE>
<TE>   The current scandal has struck with unprecedented breadth and fury. In
the last three months scores of priests from coast to coast and three
bishops around the world have resigned, been fired or asked to retire.</TE>
<TE>   So volatile is the debate that rational discussion is impaired. "We
are in a dangerous period. . . . Everyone inside and outside the church,
wants to find simplistic solutions," wrote Father Stephen J. Rossetti,
president of the St. Luke Institute, which treats sexually abusing
priests, in the upcoming issue of the Jesuit magazine America.</TE>
<TE>   The church's dilemma lies at the intersection of celibacy, homosexual
and secrecy.</TE>
<TE>Celibacy</TE>
<TE>   What one often hears is that if an offending priest had a healthy
sexual outlet--in other words, a wife--he wouldn't turn to minors for
sexual gratification.</TE>
<TE>   But to suggest a direct correlation between celibacy and the sexual
abuse of minors is both facile and specious. Study after study
demonstrate that pedophilia, an attraction to pre-pubescent children, and
ephebophilia, an attraction to post-pubescent youths, more often involves
heterosexual men who are friends or relatives of their victims.</TE>
<TE>   In such cases, the abusers suffer from what psychologists call
arrested psychosexual development. They are sexually immature. Often they
have difficulty relating to and negotiating with adults. In other cases,
they may have experienced feelings of abandonment and low self-esteem.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases, heterosexual men have been known to molest boys, not
necessarily because of latent homosexual feelings, but because they were
molested when they were young. These are but a few explanations of a
complex pathology.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, celibacy can introduce added tensions in the life of a
priest who is not psychologically healthy or emotionally mature.</TE>
<TE>   In years past, many priests who later became offenders had moved
directly from high school seminaries to graduate seminaries without the
usual life experiences common to most other young men.</TE>
<TE>   Once in seminary, their sexual maturity was further impeded as the
church inculcated its future priests with the value and necessity of
celibacy. Celibacy is seen as a way of "donating" oneself completely to
God and to those to whom the priest ministers as an "icon of Christ."</TE>
<TE>   Seminarians have been known to surreptitiously explore their
sexuality, but several priests said in interviews with The Times that
they didn't want to risk their future ordination by getting caught. They
waited until after they were ordained. (None of these priests are known
to have ever been accused of sexual abuse of minors.)</TE>
<TE>   Celibacy is difficult under the best of circumstances. Richard Sipe, a
former priest who has closely studied the issue, reports that at any
given time only 50% of priests are celibate. Over a priest's lifetime,
only 2% are consistently celibate, Sipe says.</TE>
<TE>   Though his figures are disputed by many in the church, few argue that
celibacy requires at least two essential factors to work: an authentic
spirituality, and nonsexual intimacy with good and trusted friends who
may or may not be in the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   One who has underscored this is Father Donald B. Cozzens, the
president-rector of Saint Mary Seminary and Graduate School of Theology
in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   "Paradoxically," Cozzens told The Times, "the safest path to an
authentic life of celibacy is not to eschew friendship because it's a
threat, but to enter into honest relationships that are intimate without
being sexual."</TE>
<TE>   Yet for a priest who is not emotionally mature or psychologically
healthy, relating to adults and sharing intimate details of his life may
be a daunting challenge. He may inappropriately turn to youths to fill
his needs for love and intimacy.</TE>
<TE>   In years past, most seminaries did not address issues of human
sexuality. That is changing. Most of the priests caught up in the latest
scandal are older men, many of them retired. That may be a hopeful sign
that more comprehensive psychological screening of seminary applicants
and a fuller discussion of sexual issues may be paying off.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no foolproof psychological test to ferret out pedophiles
or ephebophiles.</TE>
<TE>Homosexuality</TE>
<TE>   Many of the recent cases of priestly abuse that have stunned the
nation involve post-pubescent boys. Some church critics argued that if
homosexual priests were purged, the problem would decline.</TE>
<TE>   This suggestion feeds on an old and disproved stereotype that gay men
are more likely to molest youths than heterosexual men. Here, again,
experts and leading bishops say retarded psychosexual development, not
sexual orientation, is the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Few deny the enormous contributions that priests who are gay continue
to make to the life and ministry of the church. It is often said that
were they suddenly to leave the scene, the church would be thrown into a
crisis. Its current priesthood shortage would be compounded many times
over.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the presence of what is widely viewed as
disproportionate numbers of homosexuals in the priesthood has, in some
critics' minds, changed the culture of the church. If present ordination
trends continue, Sipe predicts, a majority of priests will be homosexuals
by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Theology school president Cozzens said that, based on 36 years in the
priesthood, estimates that at least 20% of priests have homosexual
orientations are probably understated, although he could not say what the
higher figure should be.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the percentage, bishops in the past have quashed suggestions
that the church undertake polls to find out just how many of its priests
are homosexual. It is an issue they simply do not want to deal with.</TE>
<TE>   The church does ordain homosexuals. It was long thought that a man's
sexual orientation was irrelevant since all priests, straight or gay, are
required to live a celibate life.</TE>
<TE>   But gay priests face dilemmas unknown to heterosexual clergy. The
church teaches that a homosexual orientation is "objectively disordered"
and that homosexual acts are "intrinsically evil." More recently, the
pope's Vatican press secretary, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said the church
should not ordain homosexuals and even suggested that the ordination of
current homosexual priests may be invalid.</TE>
<TE>   Gay priests learned long ago to remain in the closet. Most feel they
could not possibly "come out" to their parishioners and expect to keep
their jobs. The tension created by their decision is only part of a
culture of secrecy that has bedeviled the church.</TE>
<TE>Secrecy</TE>
<TE>   Secrecy, not sexual orientation, is responsible for the depth of the
current crisis. Catholics outraged by the sexual abuse at least
understood how a priest could fall. But they could not countenance the
secrecy of some of their bishops, who knowingly shuffled sexual-abuser
priests from parish to parish and left parishioners in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   Though the bishops no doubt believed they were protecting the church
from scandal, in retrospect most now realize they did greater damage by
not firing wayward priests and being more open with their parishioners.
Their most frequent defense has been that psychologists advised them that
priests who molested adolescents could be successfully treated.</TE>
<TE>   Resentment of secrecy in the church has given more spirit to
long-running contentions among reformers who have called for a bigger
voice for the laity in the American church and demanded more
accountability from bishops. Other denominations allow churches to hire
and fire their clergymen and elect their bishops, but the Catholic
hierarchy has zealously guarded those prerogatives.</TE>
<TE>   The secrecy argument leads not only to discussion of accountability
but also to the question of whom the church allows to be priests.
Liberals argued that women and married men would not have stood for the
secrecy of sexual abuse. Nor, they say, would the church's progress in
addressing the problem have been so uneven.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were women priests and women bishops and married bishops,
the likelihood of this happening in the first place would be close to
nil," said Terrance Sweeney of Encino, who left the priesthood to be
married. "Men and women who were in positions of authority in the church,
who had young children, simply would not have tolerated this. They would
not have tolerated the secrecy."</TE>
<TE>   Bishops dispute that. In the last decade, most have put sexual-abuse
prevention policies into place, and they have toughened them over the
years.</TE>
<TE>   Yet leaders of abuse-victims groups believe it took outside
pressures--among them tougher criminal laws requiring the reporting of
sexual abuse and costly settlements with victims--to force the church to
act.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clear Channel Communications, the nation's biggest radio and
concert conglomerate, has ousted its two top concert executives in a
management shake-up, sources said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Sources said Brian Becker, chief executive of Clear Channel's
entertainment division, had been disappointed with the performance of the
concert operation's co-chiefs, Rodney Eckerman and Irv Zuckerman. It was
unclear Saturday whether the two would take other roles at the company.
Veteran concert executives Don Law and Dave Lucas are expected to be
named the new co-chiefs.</LD>
<LD>   The move follows a poor year in the concert industry that was
compounded by canceled tours and lower attendance after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. Clear Channel's entertainment division, which promotes
concerts, motor sports and other events, saw its 2001 pro forma earnings,
a critical measure for media companies, plunge 21% to $153 million.</LD>
<TE>   The San Antonio company recently handled major concert tours for 'N
Sync and Madonna, but it has failed to secure tours from other big acts,
such as Britney Spears and Creed.</TE>
<TE>   The shake-up comes as Clear Channel, which dominates the nation's
concert business, is continuing to expand. Clear Channel has expressed
interest in buying its closest competitor, Los Angeles-based House of
Blues, which also has received interest from Denver billionaire Philip
Anschutz, former Ticketmaster chief Fred Rosen and radio broadcaster
Entercom Communications Corp., sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Any deal for Clear Channel to buy House of Blues would likely be
scrutinized by the Justice Department. Last month, a New York congressman
asked antitrust officials to examine allegations Clear Channel sought to
undercut the recent sale of New York promotion firm Metropolitan
Entertainment to a Clear Channel rival, concert executive Mitch Slater.
The company has denied any impropriety.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Justice Department sued Clear Channel over its policy
prohibiting diabetic concert-goers from taking their medical supplies
with them into venues. The federal lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court
in Philadelphia, accuses the company of violating the Americans With
Disabilities Act by forcing people with diabetes to choose between
attending concerts or taking unreasonable health risks. Clear Channel
maintains its concert policies are in accordance with ADA.</TE>

<HD>Black Studies Professor Leaves Harvard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PRINCETON, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>Cornel West, one of Harvard University's most distinguished
black-studies professors, is leaving for Princeton University after a
falling-out with Harvard President Lawrence Summers.</LD>
<LD>   The Princeton board of trustees approved his appointment Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Also appointed Saturday were Chang-rae Lee, an award-winning Korean
American author who will join Princeton's Humanities Council and creative
writing program, and Eddie S. Glaude Jr., a Bowdoin College professor
specializing in African American religious studies.</LD>
<TE>   West's leaving is the second defection from Harvard's black studies
department this year. K. Anthony Appiah accepted an offer from Princeton
in January, citing personal reasons, not the dispute with Summers.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard's department has been at odds with Summers, who took over the
post last year, over affirmative action.</TE>
<TE>   Summers was also said to have rebuked West for recording a rap CD and
leading a political committee for the Rev. Al Sharpton's possible
presidential campaign. He also reportedly accused West of allowing grade
inflation in his introductory black studies course.</TE>
<TE>   West gained prominence with his 1993 book "Race Matters."</TE>
<TE>   "All of us in the Harvard community are grateful to Cornel West for
his significant contributions to Harvard's academic life, especially the
great inspiration he provided to so many students," Summers said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, 36, joins acclaimed authors, including Toni Morrison and Joyce
Carol Oates at Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about prestige," Lee said Saturday. "It really is about
artistic possibility and inspiration for me. I almost feel as though I'm
in a situation that's cousin to what a Princeton student might feel, who
wants to work with these writers."</TE>
<TE>   Lee caught the publishing world's attention in 1995 with his debut
novel "Native Speaker," which won the Ernest Hemingway Foundation/PEN
Award and the American Book Award.</TE>

<HD>In Wartime, Women Get to Make WAVES</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Behind the U. S. Navy's World War II flyboys was a small band of
women whose wing-and-a-prayer contribution to the war effort never made
history books.</LD>
<LD>   Almost 60 years ago, an elite group of WAVES--Women Accepted in
Volunteer Emergency Services--charted a new course in air navigation and
opened doors for other women into a male-dominated branch of the service.</LD>
<LD>   These were the women--80 of them airborne, hundreds more on the
ground--who served as stateside navigators, training male pilots in
navigational skills and sometimes even riding shotgun on domestic
military flights. They were the forebears of the Navy women who today fly
as "top gun" pilots.</LD>
<TE>   The Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, ignited a war in
the Pacific that changed the world. It also brought to Los Angeles'
Terminal Island a new kind of Navy navigator.</TE>
<TE>   To free up men to serve at sea, thousands of women joined the Navy in
the newly organized women's unit called WAVES, and a few thousand more
enlisted in the Coast Guard's new SPAR women's units, short for Semper
Paratus, "Always Ready."</TE>
<TE>   Of those, 25,000 WAVES and 1,900 SPARs became part of naval aviation
in jobs as mechanics, air traffic controllers, and radio and air
navigators. About 200 of them worked at Terminal Island.</TE>
<TE>   Only 80 female navigators, some of whom were already private pilots,
were sent for further training, 50 flight hours in twin-engine military
planes. That earned them prized gold wings as the nation's first female
military personnel to share noncombat flight duties with men.</TE>
<TE>   Before World War II, only wartime emergencies brought women into
military work, and then only in a limited capacity. Female volunteers had
participated in every war involving American men, and formalizing their
participation started to take shape in 1901 and 1908 with creation of the
Army and Navy nurse corps.</TE>
<TE>   In 1942, things changed. Joy Bright Hancock, a civilian pilot who had
been a Navy yeoman in World War I, pressured the government to create the
Navy WAVES and open up the field of navigation and related jobs to women,
both on the ground and in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock was later promoted to captain and named director of the WAVES,
making her the highest-ranking Navy woman, a distinction she retained for
years.</TE>
<TE>   To boost enlistments from women, Eleanor Roosevelt arranged for the
American-born couturier Mainbocher--birth name Main Rousseau Bocher--to
design uniforms for WAVES and SPARs. His prior experience included
introducing the strapless evening dress in 1934.</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, Marian Davis Skidmore and Marjorie Law Beringer were
21-year-old UCLA graduates when they and six other women joined the Navy
and then, in Navy uniform, became the first female radio navigators
assigned to Reeves Field, a military airfield on Terminal Island.</TE>
<TE>   Skidmore and Beringer had just finished naval boot camp at New York
City's Hunter College, where they earned high marks in math and were
among the first women selected to attend the Naval Air Navigation School
in Atlanta. The 10-week radio navigation course--known as "coming in on
the beam"--was tough. Those who did not maintain a 3.2 average were
tossed out of the school. Trainees studied meteorology, drew weather
maps, learned temperature drops and forecasts. They navigated and charted
hypothetical four-hour flights over the Pacific, learned Morse code and
how to use basic instruments such as a compass, altimeter, tachometer and
turn-and-back indicators.</TE>
<TE>   They wangled sea duty in the Pacific, Skidmore recalled
sardonically--which meant "riding the San Pedro Ferry back and forth
across the harbor" to a "glamour hot spot" on Terminal Island, "the best
duty of any WAVES radio navigators."</TE>
<TE>   Reeves Field was known as the "Hollywood Country Club" because its
wartime residents included such actors as Robert Taylor and Charles
"Buddy" Rogers, who was married to Mary Pickford, as well as actress
Norma Shearer's husband, ski instructor and Navy aviator Lt. Martin
Arrouge.</TE>
<TE>   Since wartime gas rationing limited driving, Rogers rode a motorcycle
to the field each day, while Skidmore and the others hopped aboard the
Pacific Electric trolley downtown for the ride to San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   WAVES seldom had to walk the last mile from the drop-off point to the
gate. If Marines patrolling the area in Jeeps didn't happen by to give
them a ride, they took a four-bit taxi ride, piling in eight to a car,
WAVES sitting on sailors' laps.</TE>
<TE>   Terminal Island was one of the first islands seized from Japanese
American fishermen and cannery workers shortly after Pearl Harbor was
attacked. Its commander was Capt. Kneflar "Socko" McGinnis, who had won
the Navy Cross for transporting the first mass flight of seaplanes from
Northern California to Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "He ran a good station," recalled Skidmore, who along with Beringer
still lives in Rancho Palos Verdes, not far from their old posting. "He
was strict but fair and you always knew where you stood with him. If men
showed up for inspection in tailor-made uniforms they'd purchased in the
Far East [with silk jacket linings, zippers and tightfitting pants]
instead of their GI-issue uniform, McGinnis had the tailor-made clothes
collected and burned."</TE>
<TE>   Day and night, hundreds of new planes roared in and out of Reeves
Field, one of the busiest naval ferrying air stations on the West Coast.
New planes just off assembly lines were flight-tested and then "pickled"
with a protective coating against the salt air before they were shipped
to the South Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   But not all went smoothly. Seasoned pilots who had already served in
the South Pacific and were now assigned stateside, as well as pilots too
old for overseas assignments, resented having to learn radio navigation
procedures from WAVES. They especially objected to WAVES' evaluating
their flying skills.</TE>
<TE>   One of the 80 airborne WAVES, Betty Turbiville, was navigating on a
training mission over the Pacific. The young male navigator she was
teaching insisted that his charts were right. If the pilot had listened
to him rather than to Turbiville, the plane would have run out of fuel
and crashed in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have anyone insult me for being in the service," Skidmore
said. "But once a pilot unfairly reported one of the WAVES who was
bowlegged for not keeping her stocking seams straight."</TE>
<TE>   While the pilot in training sat in a mock-up training cockpit wearing
a headset, Skidmore sat at a desk just outside, also wearing a headset,
sending Morse code signals to the pilot, changing wind speeds and
charting his path on a map to see how well he could follow the course
changes. She reckons she trained hundreds of naval navigators this way.</TE>
<TE>   On March 30, 1945, as the war neared its end, the Navy authorized a
distinctive gold wings insignia for the 80 airborne female navigators,
all of whom until then had worn a 1920s-design "observer" wing with a
compass in the center over crossed anchors.</TE>
<TE>   In their purses, these women carried copies of their orders
authorizing them to wear wings because they were often stopped by senior
officers who pointed out that they weren't allowed to wear their
boyfriends' wings.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves Field was decommissioned in 1947 and eventually swallowed up in
harbor development. As aircraft got bigger, its landing field became too
small for safe touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, all women on active military duty, including WAVES, were made
an official part of the armed forces under the Women's Armed Services
Integration Act. Even so, women had to wait until 1967 for the removal of
restrictions on the rank that even career military women could achieve.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating the contributions these women made to the war effort and
commemorating their 60th anniversary, the Los Angeles Maritime Museum in
San Pedro recently opened its newest exhibit, "WAVES and SPARS: Navy and
Coast Guard Women of World War II."</TE>
<TE>   The show, which runs through July, chronicles an extraordinary group
of women, some of whom earned the much-coveted U. S. Navy aerial
navigator's wings despite sentiments expressed by some enlisted men that
it would take "two women to do the work of one man." Turbiville's
dress-blue uniform, with its gold wings, is on display there.</TE>
<TE>   Women's contributions were noted contemporaneously as well. In 1944,
the Navy estimated that the number of WAVES on duty that year equaled the
number of men it would have taken in peacetime to man 10 battleships, 10
aircraft carriers, 28 cruisers and 50 destroyers.</TE>

<HD>Whooping Cranes' Absence at Refuge Raises Concerns</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: The endangered birds failed to winter at a New Mexico
shelter for the first time since 1975.</DH>

<DL>BOSQUE DEL APACHE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, N.M.
</DL>
<LD>The sign behind the counter at the visitors center on this jewel of
the Rio Grande said it all:</LD>
<LD>   Canada geese 230</LD>
<LD>   Snow geese 14,100</LD>
<TE>   Ducks 20,250</TE>
<TE>   Sandhill cranes 8,760</TE>
<TE>   Whooping cranes 0</TE>
<TE>   No whooping cranes wintered this year at the refuge for the first time
since 1975, when an experimental migrating flock of the endangered birds
was established.</TE>
<TE>   Only two stuffed whoopers, a young one and a mature one, stand mute in
a glass case at the center, displayed next to a sandhill crane--a cousin
and failed foster parent. The center doesn't even carry posters of the
poster child of endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really sad," Linda Getz said as she visited Bosque del Apache
from Bloomington, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   "They were one of the highlights," said Nettie Ireland of Plainfield,
Ill. "You'd see them far off. The first time I saw them, I said, 'You
can't miss that one.' "</TE>
<TE>   Whooping cranes are the tallest birds in North America, standing about
5 feet with a long, sinuous neck and a red and black head with a long,
pointed beak. Snow-white body feathers are accented by black-tipped wings
that span about 7 1/2 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The 57,200-acre refuge--1,100 acres farmed and 2,000 flooded with Rio
Grande water--is host to 350 species of birds annually, from birds of
prey to songbirds. It is visited by coyotes, bobcats, cougars, elk and
mule deer. In the summer, the refuge's cottonwood trees stand verdant in
contrast to the surrounding spare Chihuahuan desert.</TE>
<TE>   So where have all the whoopers gone?</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the experimental migrating flock was to boost the number
of whoopers, which dwindled to a low of 15 nationwide in 1941. The
numbers have since rebounded to 396.</TE>
<TE>   The program began in 1975 with four young whoopers. Biologists began
placing whooper eggs in sandhill crane nests at the Grays Lake National
Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Idaho. The plan was to have the sandhills
raise the whoopers at their summer digs in Idaho and show them the way
750 miles south to bask in the bosque in central New Mexico during the
winter.</TE>
<TE>   As the whoopers matured, they would bond with their own and the result
would be a fresh crop of whooping crane chicks.</TE>
<TE>   The plan didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   The whoopers didn't bond and they didn't reproduce. There seemed to be
more sexual chemistry between female whoopers and male sandhills.</TE>
<TE>   "Then there was a problem of getting birds of reproductive age
together in breeding areas. It's a wide area where they were summering,"
said wildlife biologist John Taylor of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
at the Bosque del Apache.</TE>
<TE>   Six or seven years of drought resulted in severe challenges for newly
hatched whoopers in Idaho in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The birds'
food supply was limited, and some of the whoopers died during the
migration.</TE>
<TE>   The number of power lines built in the San Luis Valley in southern
Colorado "had grown exponentially, and there were a lot of crane losses
to power-line strikes," said Tom Stehn, whooping crane recovery team
coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   But Taylor said it was more a problem of whoopers following their
smaller foster parents into electric lines everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, four whoopers raised by Kent Clegg, an Idaho biologist,
followed him and his ultralight airplane south to the Bosque del Apache.</TE>
<TE>   Clegg's effort "seemed to have great promise," Taylor said. "They were
associating with each other."</TE>
<TE>   But by then, the Rocky Mountain program was doomed.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1997, when Kent Clegg did his experiment, it was pretty well
understood that this was just an experiment. It was not an attempt to get
a new flock started," said Stehn, who is also a biologist at Aransas
National Wildlife Refuge in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   It was the last time whooping cranes were released in the West.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the Western whooper program was sealed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific and Central flyway councils, which issue waterfowl hunting
guidelines to the federal government, recommended against continuing the
Rocky Mountain flock, despite its proven ability to attract tourists and
bird watchers.</TE>
<TE>   "The general concern was that having an endangered species around
would cause Fish and Wildlife to reduce the amount of hunting
opportunities," Stehn said. That would mean shorter seasons or closing
specific areas to hunting.</TE>
<TE>   "But we in the whooping crane program feel that we can definitely have
both. We can have hunting and can protect whooping cranes. The two can
coexist," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also in 1999, the New Mexico Game Commission decided to oppose
introducing any more whooping cranes into the Rocky Mountain flock,
citing a lack of sufficient habitat to maintain a self-sustaining whooper
population. The group also said New Mexico was outside the historical
winter range of whoopers--"a fact that has been debated for years,"
Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Stehn said his recovery team felt that any attempt to get a new flock
started would mean choosing a place where there would be the best chance
of success.</TE>
<TE>   The team looked east.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a question of desire, and the Western states were
reluctant to continue any recovery work and when we went east, they were
thrilled with the idea," Stehn said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a migratory flock of eight whoopers was started between the
Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge in Florida and the Necedah
National Wildlife Refuge in Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   The birds followed ultralight airplanes to learn the route. They
completed their 1,200-mile journey to Florida Dec. 3. One whooper died
when it hit an electric line. Bobcats killed two more.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor still believes Clegg's experiment would work in the West, "as
long as the flyway councils and whooping crane recovery team are in
agreement. I think that would give it a green light."</TE>
<TE>   Any concern over whether whoopers may be killed during hunting of
light geese at the Bosque del Apache has been mollified. Taylor said
there has never been a hunting incident involving whoopers in the middle
Rio Grande Valley from Cochiti Lake to Elephant Butte.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 396 whoopers surviving today, 174 winter at the Aransas
National Wildlife Refuge and spend their summers at Wood Buffalo National
Park in Canada's Northwest Territory; 113 are in captivity; 103 are in a
nonmigratory flock in the Kissimmee, Fla., area; and five split time
between Florida and Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   The birds can live up to 40 years, but 25 is a more typical life span
in the wild, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   A 19-year-old whooper--the lone survivor of the experimental
flock--spent this winter in New Mexico, at the state's Casa Colorada
wildlife management area north of the refuge.</TE>
<TE>   The whooper left at the end of February for its summer home at Red
Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Montana.</TE>

<HD>It's a Fair Wind Blowing for Farmers in Pacific Northwest</HD>
<DH>Energy: Turbines are now cropping up all over the region to harness
the strong breezes for electricity generation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GILLIAN FLACCUS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASCO, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>Wheat farmer John Hilderbrand once cursed the wind that roars down
the Columbia River Gorge and through this rural, hilly community,
damaging crops and kicking up dust.</LD>
<LD>   That was before the same powerful gusts paid for his vacations to
Panama and Costa Rica, and allowed him to quit his part-time job as a
real estate agent.</LD>
<LD>   In the past year, dozens of wind turbines have appeared on the drab,
rolling expanses of rural farmland in Oregon and Washington. The towering
white machines, the latest in energy technology, loom in uneven lines on
the horizon, spinning lazily over acres of tilled ground.</LD>
<TE>   The spindly turbines seem almost alien in this remote setting. But
Hilderbrand and scores of other farmers have made thousands of dollars by
leasing their land to wind-farm developers. Hilderbrand, a
third-generation farmer, has five wind turbines on a small slice of his
1,120 acres.</TE>
<TE>   The project's developer, Northwestern Wind Power, spent $24 million
building a total of 16 turbines in Sherman County, a desolate,
wind-scoured Oregon county that hugs the Columbia River.</TE>
<TE>   "The wife says, 'I want those turbines on every acre we've got,' "
said Hilderbrand. "I'm quite well paid. We had a record drought this past
year, so it was good we had this."</TE>
<TE>   Once considered a fringe technology, wind power has in the past few
years gained currency as an economic--and environmentally friendly--way
to generate power.</TE>
<TE>   It has particularly caught on in the Pacific Northwest, where a recent
energy shortage and higher power prices sent developers scrambling to tie
up the windiest land in a latter-day gold rush.</TE>
<TE>   The region saw the second-largest growth in wind power last year,
after Texas, said Randall Swisher, executive director of American Wind
Energy Assn. If all the proposed projects are completed, the Pacific
Northwest will be the No. 1 wind-power producer in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of Columbia River landowners, eager for the lucrative lease
payments that developers offer, have signed onto 15 projects planned
along the gorge over the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that the market for wind in the Northwest is
hot," Swisher said. "If you're a windy landowner . . . you've probably
gotten a lot of attention from developers."</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern Wind Power is paying 60 farmers in four counties to build
wind turbines on at least 150,000 acres. Another developer, SeaWest Wind
Power Inc., has leased "tens of thousands" of acres from at least 20
landowners in Oregon and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   By 2003, wind projects in Oregon and Washington are to produce a
combined 1,400 megawatts of power.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers and developers won't divulge how much money they get for
leases on windy land, but industry experts say payments can exceed $4,000
per wind turbine per year. Some developers give farmers a percentage of
the gross revenue reaped from the wind, while others prefer a onetime fee
or annual payments.</TE>
<TE>   In Sherman County, some farmers can expect a $10,000 sign-up payment,
$15,000 for each turbine installed and up to $5,000 per turbine per year.
That doesn't include the money developers pay to reserve the land--about
$2,000 a month--while they conduct wind studies.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers usually give up less than 5% of their land to the wind farms
in a 20- to 50-year lease, depending on the developer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a no-brainer. You sit down with a pencil and push it and
you say, 'So we lost three acres, so what?' said Terry Kaseberg, a
third-generation wheat farmer. "We're getting something for nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Kaseberg said wind farms may be the future for landowners who find it
increasingly difficult to make a living from traditional farming. He has
leased three of his 5,000 acres to five turbines and is being courted by
at least two more wind developers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't start adding value to your crops, I guarantee you
nobody's going to be farming here in 10 years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Kaseberg and others realize that although wind power has helped
them in the short-term, its long-term prospects are less certain.</TE>
<TE>   A number of hurdles face those who invest in wind, including problems
with inadequate rural transmission lines and the uncertainty of the
overall energy market.</TE>
<TE>   A nonprofit group called WinDustry works to keep farmers informed
about their rights when dealing with wind developers and maintains a
national Web site to help farmers evaluate their land's wind potential.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Daniels, the director of the Minneapolis-based watchdog group,
said some companies will pressure farmers with a contrived deadline or
sign up landowners before developers have financial backing or a buyer
for the expected power.</TE>
<TE>   "The time when the farmer needs the information is when somebody's
knocking on their door, and at that point they're already at a
disadvantage because the person who is knocking on their door has more
information than they do," she said. "It moves fast and these are
long-term binding contracts. You can only hope that nobody signs these
contracts without visiting an attorney."</TE>
<TE>   For farmers and developers already involved in projects, transmission
problems and a roller-coaster power market are more pressing concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Wind farms operate in rural areas where power transmission systems
were designed to distribute power, not to handle large amounts of power
generation. In some cases, the rural substations used by wind farms to
transmit wind-generated power are already at or near capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Additional power generated by expanding wind farms will face a
bottleneck unless utilities or developers invest in higher-capacity
transmission systems--a potential roadblock for investors.</TE>
<TE>   "Transmission is a problem in general," said Allen Barkley, general
manager at the Klondike wind farm near Wasco, Ore. "Particularly in the
rural areas, the transmission was never developed to support large
generation projects."</TE>
<TE>   A fluctuating market may also dictate how many wind projects will
proceed, industry experts said. Last summer, when the Northwest was in
the throes of a drought and severe energy shortage, power prices soared
and investment in alternative energy sources, such as wind, increased.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the Bonneville Power Administration, the federal agency
that controls 29 hydroelectric dams, put out a request to developers for
1,000 megawatts of wind power. They received proposals totaling 2,600
megawatts of wind power--an amount equal to one-third of the agency's
total energy production.</TE>
<TE>   "What amazed us was the tremendous response," said Ed Mosey, a BPA
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the power market has improved and a sudden energy surplus
sent power prices plummeting. Companies may no longer be as willing to
take up wind projects, which are more expensive to develop and represent
a less consistent source of power.</TE>
<TE>   But developers believe the market for wind power will stay strong
overall because European countries are trying to reduce carbon dioxide
levels, while large utilities want to buy more "green" power.</TE>
<TE>   That is just what farmers like Kaseberg want to hear.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always had wind here and we've always cussed it," he said. "But
we're tempering that now. I see towers going up all over Sherman County."</TE>

<LD>In "Just Like Family" (by Heather King, March 10), the gay couple
is described as swishy, catty--cartoonish even--but also lovable. It's as
if Angelenos can only deal with gay couples who are quasi-eccentric. How
about writing an article that doesn't buy into the "just call me Martha,
darling!" jungle print lava-lava-wearing older gay couple stereotype?
What about the regular Joe gay couples who live next to so many L.A.
residents? We are out there, in plain jeans, working like everyone else
and eating dinner like everyone else with no caviar or lobster-stuffed
tomatoes in sight.</LD>

<LD>Lee Green's exceptionally well-written profile of Michael Josephson
and the secular ethics movement succeeds in capturing the essence of a
remarkable man making remarkable contributions to American society ("The
Indisputable Mr. Scruples," March 10). Josephson's insights into the
ethical dilemmas of our times and the clarity with which he is able to
bring these into focus for a wide and diverse audience qualifies him as a
sort of national treasure.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles YMCA is one of more than 500 disparate organizations
across the nation involved with Josephson's Character Counts! Coalition
in teaching children (and the people who work with them) the common
language of the "Six Pillars of Character": trustworthiness, respect,
responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship. A society that fails to
understand what it takes to raise children of character has a lot more to
worry about than almost anything else that might occupy its time and
attention.</LD>
<LD>   Larry M. Rosen</LD>
<TE>   President and CEO</TE>
<TE>   YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Green's article shows that the mere idea of secular ethics is weak at
best. There are so many holes in it that finding a place to start is
difficult. Josephson's "Six Pillars of Character" only work if there is
an objective moral absolute to hold them up against. Whose standards of
caring, fairness, responsibility, etc. do we use as a measuring stick?
Josephson's? Mine? Mother Teresa's? Hitler's? Perhaps if there were
someone who was perfect, that would be the place to start. You can see
how secular ethics doesn't work, and that we end up back at relativism
and the damage that it has caused. There is either an objective good and
bad or there isn't, and if there isn't, then nothing's wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Shane W. Cadman</TE>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was astounded by the opening paragraphs of Green's article in which
Josephson confronted the principal of L.A.'s Cathedral High School, the
soccer coach of St. Genevieve High School and Los Angeles Times
sportswriter Eric Sondheimer about their apparent approval of athletes
probing the limits of sports rules as long as they don't get caught. Can
these responsible people truly concur with Al Davis' "just win, baby"
philosophy of sports? There is a vital need to reinstate sportsmanship,
for without sportsmanship, the true value of sports will be lost. We need
more of Josephson making us realize the importance of how we play games.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Mead</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I dispute Mr. Scruples. The U.S. women's soccer team did not cheat to
win the 1999 World Cup. It was the referee's job to whistle the
infraction. The referee's mistake (or cowardice) cannot be construed as
cheating. Goalkeeper Briana Scurry jumped off her line for the same
reason a sprinter false starts or a drag racer pops his clutch too soon,
and she had every right to expect the referee to do his/her job and
penalize her for it. She had no intention of exposing herself to charges
of cheating. Josephson's accusation is bizarre and undermines his
otherwise commendable endeavor.</TE>

<LD>Every few minutes, a clanging crash dispels the evening quiet
around the cul-de-sac in San Jacinto in Riverside County. The noise comes
from a lighted open garage at 351 Quince Drive, where, amid plastic
bottles of gopher mix and car wax, Greg Schouten works on his world-class
ambition.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Pat Cullen-Carroll, the homeowner at 351 Quince, watches as
Schouten leans forward from the waist, flexing his hands. Before him on
the makeshift plywood platform is a York barbell weighted at 253 1/2
pounds. Schouten takes the bar in hand. With a quiet expulsion of breath
and in one motion, he heaves it to the tops of his thighs, dips to a
squat and snaps it above his head. Holding the bar aloft with straight,
outward-angling arms, he rises to a standing position, completing a
perfect snatch. Then he steps back and lets go of the bar. Blang!</LD>
<LD>   Schouten is 25, 5 foot 9, with a blond crew cut and shadow beard. A
part-time football and track coach at San Jacinto High, he is also the
sixth-ranked Olympic-style weightlifter in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   The 253 1/2 pounds on the bar is merely his maximum workout weight for
the night. In competition, he has snatched 314 pounds, and intends by the
2004 Olympics to have worked up to something like 357 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   The snatch is one of two events that constitute Olympic weightlifting,
the only strength sport in the Games. The other is the clean-and-jerk, in
which the lifter raises a bar to chin level as he squats, stands up, then
scissor-kicks to a split stance beneath the bar, raising it above his
head and finally bringing his feet together to stand erect. In
competition, Schouten has clean-and-jerked 364 pounds and is intent on
423 pounds by the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   He himself weighs 170.</TE>
<TE>   To cognoscenti, the term "weightlifters" applies only to
Olympic-stylers, not to powerlifters (whose events are the squat, dead
lift and bench press) or, heaven forbid, bodybuilders. For serious
weightlifters, everything points to the Olympics, the sport's quadrennial
parole from obscurity. There are no intercollegiate weightlifting
competitions, no scholarships, no professional tour.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, this lack of reward has meant a chronic shortage
of athletes and coaches and, thus, slender Olympic fortunes for a
generation. Los Angeles, for example, has but one true weightlifters gym.
"Most fitness centers do not like to have Olympic lifters in their
facility," says Paul Fleschler, technical director of USA Weightlifting
Federation. "They make a lot of noise, because the weights are made to be
dropped from overhead. Also, fitness centers cater to people who
primarily care about how they look. Most of the athletes don't care much
what they look like, they just want to be able to lift a lot of weight."</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. gym is at Van Nuys High School. It is the domain of master
weightlifting coach Bob Takano. Gym and coach are well known within the
small world of weightlifting, and exemplify its ethic of sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   The barn-like facility, gritty, scarred and devoid of amenities, is
"very much like the training center for the Bulgarian national team,"
Takano says.</TE>
<TE>   Takano, 54, has coached the U.S. women's team in the world
weightlifting championships, and will be an assistant coach of the men's
team in this year's competition in Poland. He teaches advanced-placement
biology and honors physiology at Van Nuys High. From 3:30 to at least 8
weeknights, and all afternoon Saturday, he can be found in the gym,
working with high-schoolers and competitive adult weightlifters. "I guess
I don't have a private life," he admits. "But there are so very few of us
who know how to do this. I have to keep the torch going. If I don't,
there's no weightlifting in L.A. There is none in Chicago now. There's no
weightlifting in Dallas. In many big cities there's no weightlifting at
all. It's amazing we have the Olympic team we do."</TE>
<TE>   What fires the sport's devotees is its deceptive sweetness, its
commingling of strength, speed, agility and precision. To them, it's
addictive. "When you do a perfect lift, the bar is almost weightless,"
says Arthur Drechsler, author of the seminal "The Weightlifting
Encyclopedia. "It's like hitting the sweet spot in golf, and once you
experience it, you want to experience it again and again."</TE>
<TE>   I have a hunch of my own about why weightlifters are so overlooked in
image-crazy Southern California: Their bodies don't resemble those that
strut in front of tourists at Muscle Beach. The puffed narcissists of
bodybuilding define our visual notions of strength. Weightlifters are the
strongest people in the world, but they tend to look much like athletes
in other competitive sports. Greg Schouten, for example, could pass for a
college-football defensive back.</TE>
<TE>   In short, another example of the special L.A. tendency to confuse
appearance with substance. Diana Fuhrman, a Van Nuys High teacher and
former student of Takano, often hears people remark, after they learn of
her three national women's weightlifting championships, "You don't look
that strong." She always tells them, "This is what strong looks like."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles has its faults--just ask geophysicist Gary Fuis of the
U.S. Geological Survey, co-investigator of the Los Angeles Region Seismic
Experiment, a project begun in 1993 to map quake faults in the L.A.
basin. LARSE, a massive effort by federal, state, city and foreign
government agencies along with local universities and colleges, has
detonated and measured 93 explosions deep underground at L.A.-area sites.
News bulletin: The San Gabriel Valley basin is 50% deeper than originally
believed, a potentially greater earthquake hazard. We asked Fuis about
future shocks.</LD>
<LD>   Why is this study important?</LD>
<LD>   For 30 years, since the San Fernando earthquake, we've never really
understood what happened or what seismic structures were involved. We
needed an image of the subsurface structure.</LD>
<TE>   Was it hard to get cooperation for the tests?</TE>
<TE>   Not really. The public in L.A. recognizes the seismic risk down there
and that something has to be done. The only problem we had was with the
land developers. Most were afraid we'd gather shallow ground information
that would jeopardize their investments.</TE>
<TE>   Give us the nutshell version of your results.</TE>
<TE>   We found the deep parts of the Northridge and the San Fernando faults
and what we think is the deep part of the Whittier Narrows Fault, to the
points where they connect with the San Andreas Fault. The major thrust
faults that are along the south side of the San Gabriel Mountains and the
Santa Susanna Mountains are connected northward to the San Andreas Fault
at great depth, of 12 to 15 miles. We didn't know that before. We were
surprised at the connection.</TE>
<TE>   What happens to these findings?</TE>
<TE>   The most immediate use is our imaging of the sedimentary basins. We've
imaged one part of the L.A. Basin and we've got a detailed view of the
San Fernando Valley, Santa Clarita Valley and San Gabriel Valley. We know
the shapes and depths of each of those basins at least at one crossing.
We can make a better estimate of the basin, and make a model. We look at
past earthquakes to see what happened and what might happen in the
future. In other words, a blueprint for future ground shakings.</TE>
<TE>   You had to fund this study from several sources, including the German
government.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of work has always been funded poorly [in proportion to] its
impact. Spending a few million bucks to mitigate disasters that run into
the hundreds of billions of dollars makes good sense to me. We hope
Congress will fund a new initiative called Earth Scope, which would fund
studies [to] find the kind of things we're finding with LARSE.</TE>
<TE>   What does the LARSE data imply for city planning and emergency
preparedness?</TE>
<TE>   The city of L.A. called me last January and asked if the building
codes should be looked at. What we've done is research. The next step is
an engineering/scientific study where we take a model of L.A. and shake
it and see how [these events] modify the old knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   You've said you're "worried" about faults near downtown L.A.</TE>
<TE>   There's an inferred blind thrust fault under the Elysian Park hills
northeast of L.A. that is growing, and we need to find out why and what
it means for the city.</TE>
<TE>   What precautions does the study call for?</TE>
<TE>   I think earthquake preparedness should be of the highest concern in
L.A. Future damaging earthquakes will happen.</TE>
<TE>   How big is the threat?</TE>
<TE>   No earthquakes in the U.S. have [centered in] cities since San
Francisco in 1906. The chance of getting killed has been--so
far--relatively low. Things could change significantly if we have a San
Fernando- or Northridge-type earthquake near any of the urban parts of
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Will earthquakes ever be predictable?</TE>
<TE>   It's like predicting the weather: We can do better now than we did in
the past.</TE>
<TE>   Could Southern California fall into the Pacific Ocean? No, L.A. is
moving up toward San Francisco. Seismologists always refer to the ground
underwater as the "continental shelf," but it's not a shelf hanging on
the wall that can fall off. It's a bad choice of words by geologists.</TE>

<HD>A Salute to Hollywood's Greatest Hair Days</HD>

<LD>Invited to: The Third Annual Hollywood Makeup Artists and Hair
Stylists Guild Awards, at the Beverly Hilton.</LD>
<LD>   A little off the top, please: "At last, I'm in a room full of hair
sycophants," crows the evening's host, Bruce Vilanch, upon entering the
dining hall. With the Picassos of perm and pancake gathering to applaud
and be seen by their peers, the portly, mop-topped comedy writer and
"Hollywood Squares" panelist hardly boasts the wildest 'do in the room.
The house lights silhouette a surreal array of inventive coifs sported by
the evening's honorees; in their shadows (for tonight) are celebs from
film, prime time and daytime who have turned out in force for the
occasion. "You see each other every day for 15 hours a day. Relationships
are very important," says actress Dana Delaney, who commenced bonding
with a Canadian crew for her new series, "Pasadena" (only to have the
Vancouver-based project go into hiatus). Director John Landis does his
part to shatter that wussy hair-and-makeup stereotype. "They're the most
dangerous people on the set," he points out. "They're closest to the
actors. You can't [you-know-what] with them."</LD>
<TE>   The kindest cut: "There has never been an Academy Award for [Best]
Contemporary Hair and Makeup," notes actor's actor Ed Harris as he and
wife Amy Madigan bestow that honor on David Lynch's "Mulholland Drive."
("Hustle up!" he barks when the beauty team is slow in mounting the
stage.) Still, it's the style-heavy "Moulin Rouge," "Mad TV" and "Six
Feet Under" (writer-creator Alan Ball and much of the HBO cast are on
hand, too) that dominate the evening. In between Vilanch's antics and the
video clips comes a succession of celebrity presenters, all duly
genuflecting to the Jennifer Aspinalls, Linle Whites, Maurizio Silvis and
other names the public never hears, in MUHS [pronounced "muse"] award
categories such as "Best Innovative Hair Styling for a Television
Series." The evening's star temperature maxes out at Dustin Hoffman (who
was known on the set of "Tootsie" as "Dustina," co-star Teri Garr
divulges). Hoffman is this year's recipient of the Barrymore award for a
body of work with "profound impact on the artistry of hair and makeup in
the entertainment industry." He immediately veers from the TelePrompTer
script. "I'm not looking at no black box that writes George Bush's
stuff," he cracks. Hoffman's extemporizing keeps the laughs coming until,
"I've been up here long enough," he concludes. "You guys are the reason
for our stuff. Thank you."</TE>
<TE>Celeb Quotient: Hoffman, Harris and lots of mid-level bulk--more
than a simple brush with fame.</TE>
<TE>Wow Factor:</TE>
<TE>   Wonderful for those in the biz; outsiders might have wished that the
proceedings be given a trim.</TE>
<TE>Grazing Level:</TE>
<TE>   Bev Hilton chicken dinner proves predictably sophisticated and
satisfying. The cash bar, however, is barbarous.</TE>

<DH>At Mimi Anzaldo's House, There Are Beads by the Bushelful</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMARCO-BARRETT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gleaming in piles and plastic trays, they could be rock candy,
mints or frosted sugar bonbons in mouthwatering shades of pink, blue,
yellow, red, white and antique green. But they're not edibles, they're
shimmering glass beads, and Mimi Anzaldo had 20,000 at last count.</LD>
<LD>   The Corona del Mar resident began collecting in 1994, after her
husband, Pete, bought her an eyeglass chain made of Native American-style
glass beads by a Colorado artist. Anzaldo began buying beads herself for
jewelry making and fell under the atavistic spell of small objects
pierced for stringing.</LD>
<LD>   Some scholars claim humans have used beads for 40,000 years. In any
event, glass, ceramic, seed, bone, metal, wood (and, later, plastic)
beads have been ubiquitous in world culture since antiquity as religious
artifacts, talismans, status symbols and currency. Anzaldo's passion is
round lampwork (handblown glass) beads, and her pieces from Greece,
Italy, Japan, China, Africa, Eastern Europe, Indonesia, Germany and
Austria come in faceted rondels, Czech glass, Italian Murano and beads
that were "made by an old man in Germany [using] all old materials."</LD>
<TE>   Beads from the '20s to '50s are more muted in color, Anzaldo says, but
their texture and shape are striking and varied. She looks for vintage
items as well as contemporary pieces made with old molds; her rarest
example is a pink Japanese lampwork piece (her favorite type) from the
'40s.</TE>
<TE>   The retired labor and delivery nurse and her husband, an ob/gyn
doctor, travel whenever they can, and Anzaldo, 42, has lost hours sitting
on the floors of shops in Greenwich Village, Boston, Seattle and
Scottsdale, searching baskets of beads. She recently attended the Tucson
Gem, Mineral and Fossil Showcase and spent $5,000 on a shopping bag full
of mostly vintage beads. "You look for old tags and beads strung on old
cotton, or you hit them against your teeth and try to scrape the paint
off. And sometimes you just have to trust your dealer."</TE>
<TE>   Bead dealers, she says, are a breed unto themselves. Conventional
retailers abound, of course, but the real characters--and, often, the
best sources--are nomads who make the rounds of bead and gem trade shows,
individualists such as the dealer known as "the Bead Man," a biker-gang
member look-alike who is a font of information and finds.</TE>
<TE>   For Anzaldo, who admits she's obsessed with beads and sells her beaded
jewelry at home parties and the occasional store, the allure is about
combining artifacts from different eras, taking disparate pieces and
"pulling them together from different places, different trips, to have a
piece of jewelry end up being beautiful."</TE>

<LD>Blame it on Quentin Tarantino if you will, but white trash chic is
here to stay. Eminem flaunts his lowdown roots in interviews, Bubba
Sparxxx revels in Georgia pig wrestling and, thanks to White Trash
Charms, you can own a gold vermeil belly chain that reads "Rock Chick."</LD>
<LD>   For Newport Beach-reared fashion stylist Brooke Dulien, starting a
funky jewelry line was a bit of a fluke. In 1998, Dulien was styling
music videos and magazine covers for musicians such as Janet Jackson and
No Doubt. "Fashion and music is my entire existence," she says. "It's
where I get my inspiration."</LD>
<LD>   Dulien was designing charms as a hobby when her lightning bolt
necklace ended up in the hands of "Sex and the City" stylist Patricia
Field; after Sarah Jessica Parker wore the bolt in a few episodes,
Dulien's phone was ringing off the hook. "People asked me what my company
was called and it just fell out of my mouth," she says. "I was thinking
to myself, 'These pieces are like white trash.' "</LD>
<TE>   White Trash items are made of 14-karat gold, diamonds and precious
stones, and come in styles apropos for the trailer park or a Hollywood
premiere, including gold cherries, '70s retro unicorns and name-drop
earrings bearing phrases such as "Lady Luck," "Punk Rock," "West Side"
and "AC/DC." The trashiest charm may be Dulien's mud flap girl, based on
the lowbrow image celebrated by truck drivers across America.</TE>
<TE>   Most pieces retail for $100 to $425, though White Trash Charms
recently took an $8,500 order from Jennifer Lopez for a replica of the
Puerto Rican flag set with rubies and sapphires. "You could wear my stuff
with faded Levis or Christian Dior," says Dulien, 31, who has made custom
pieces for Christina Aguilera and Madonna. "People like my line because
it's fun."</TE>
<TE>   So why is white trash culture so fashionable these days? "Isn't it
always?" asks Dulien innocently.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   White Trash Charms is available at Jennifer Kaufman and Fred Segal in
Los Angeles.</TE>

<LD>The beginning of the end of life as we know it occurred here, on a
beaten patch of asphalt out in the vast, flat no man's land of greater
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The beginning of the end came unannounced. There was no salute, no
blast of trumpets or heavenly choir. It came in the sunken heat of summer
at an abandoned drive-in movie theater called  the Roadium.</LD>
<LD>   The Roadium was graced by a grand arched gate that, in its day,
promised entry to whatever secret kingdom Hollywood could conjure. By the
summer of 1985, though, the drive-in, its dreams and innocent magic are
relics of a long-gone past. The dull blur of south county towns the
Roadium served--Torrance, Lawndale, Hawthorne, Gardena, Carson and
Compton--are staging areas in a decade-long descent into what feels at
times like a war zone; and at times is. Street corners are outposts in a
new crack economy, boulevards battle lines dividing endless variations of
Bloods and Crips, usually from one another, always from themselves.</LD>
<TE>   With the drive-in theater gone, the stuff of dreams has been traded
for just plain stuff. The Roadium's arch now frames an open-air bazaar
piled high with cheap Chinese toys, one-size-fits-all Sri Lankan socks,
used car batteries, secondhand tool chests, last year's Barbie dolls and
canned peas with last week's use-by date. The Roadium is a swap meet.</TE>
<TE>   The first thing you notice are the people. The place is so jammed you
wonder how they ever got along without it. At the moment, the biggest
crowd surrounds a little stall just inside the old arch. Kids are lined
up two, three deep along the perimeter of the stall, whooping and
hollering. A lanky Japanese guy, whippet-thin and wired, presides behind
a homemade plywood table in the middle of the noise. The table is stacked
high with records, LPs and those 12-inch singles that disc jockeys spin.
He's got more of  the same displayed on a 20-foot-wide pegboard behind
him.</TE>
<TE>   He's got so much product that some days, days when the heat is so
thick you could lean against it, the table legs sink an inch into the
melting asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   The whole place isn't much bigger than a walk-in closet, and it's hot
in every way imaginable. The air's an oven, the kids fired by the desire
for the new.</TE>
<TE>   "Yo, Steve. Whatcha got?"</TE>
<TE>   "Stevie, Stevie, whatcha got new, man?"</TE>
<TE>   Steve Yano is the man of the moment, an East L.A. guy who has somehow
swapped a career as a high school guidance counselor to become the
uncrowned king of a swap meet music underground. He has turned his table
into the hippest, hottest record store on the West Coast. He's got
everything--all the new East Coast hip-hop, the best old-school R&amp;B, all
the L.A. dance jams, that locking-and-popping stuff you see on "Soul
Train." He has stuff nobody else has, stuff nobody else has ever heard
of. He has stuff so new it doesn't even exist yet (not officially), stuff
with no labels, no packaging, just the stamp of the new.</TE>
<TE>   It is the new that tugs at the ears of the man who will deliver the
beginning of the end of life as we know it. He's a little guy, 5-5, 5-6,
tops, with the slow swagger of a hustler fat on house money. Steve Yano
remembers him showing up that first day at the Roadium, going through
piles of 12-inch singles. Big piles.</TE>
<TE>   "He looks 'em over, stacks 'em up. Then says, 'I'll take these."'</TE>
<TE>   The guy has maybe 20 records in front of him. Yano is used to kids
buying one, maybe two at a time. These are not rich kids. They wouldn't
be at the swap meet if they were. Yano thinks this guy is scamming.</TE>
<TE>   "All those?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," the kid says. He's got a high, squeaky voice that makes him
sound even younger than he looks. And he looks about 13. He picks up one
of the 12-inchers, a cut from some local DJs called the World Class
Wreckin' Cru.</TE>
<TE>   "Where you get that from?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   The question doesn't even register with Yano, who still can't believe
the kid has money to buy all the records he has in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   "All of them?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," the kid says, and reaches down in his sock. He comes back up
with a roll of cash. He peels the bills off. Bam. Just  like that.</TE>
<TE>   Then he says: "Tell Dre, Eric says, 'Whassup?' "</TE>
<TE>   With that, Eric Wright turns and walks off with a stack of records
half as big as he is. Yano, of course, tells Dre nothing. Dre, Andre
Young, a member of the Wreckin' Cru, is one of the hottest young DJs in
L.A. He doesn't need to be bothered, man. Not with this kid anyhow.</TE>
<TE>   Wright comes back the next weekend, asks about Dre again, wants his
numbers. He's polite but persistent and comes back every week. Yano
finally asks Dre if he knows a homeboy named Eric Wright. And damned if
Dre doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   "Next thing I know," Yano says, "those guys are on a three-way call
with me at 2 in the morning. Eric wants to open a record store. I tell
him, 'Don't do it. It's a bad business. I can show you how, but don't do
it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Eric has money--street money, dope money--and wants to go straight.
Dre, meanwhile, bugs Yano, who knows every low-level somebody in the
record business in all of Los Angeles, to start a record label. Dre wants
a place to put out his own music.</TE>
<TE>   In time, these dreams merged and came true. Eric went into the record
business, all right, not with a corner store but with his own label and
Dre was on it. Soon that label, Ruthless Records, sent out into the world
some of the weirdest, funniest, saddest, maddest music anybody ever
heard. Out of that little swap meet stall came the partnership that
rocked, then overran the record business.</TE>
<TE>   The partnership took full form in the hip-hop group Niggaz With
Attitude, which in 1988 released a record called "Straight Outta
Compton." This was the group's first national release. N.W.A was largely
unknown. The record contained no hit singles. In most of the country,
nothing from the record was played even once on the radio. It was too
crude, too misogynistic, too violent. MTV, which had by then established
itself as the primary gatekeeper of popular culture, refused to play
N.W.A videos.</TE>
<TE>   No radio, no television and no publicity.</TE>
<TE>   "Straight Outta Compton" sold 3 million records.</TE>
<TE>   The music it contained was so perverse, so nihilistic, so forbidden,
politicians--then and still--elbowed each other out of the way to condemn
it. Highbrow critics couldn't find language strong enough to critique it;
they went further, questioning whether it was even music at all. It's
barbaric, they said. Hide the women and children; bar the doors. Too
late.</TE>
<TE>   Gangsta rap was in the house.</TE>
<TE>Locking and Popping</TE>
<TE>   The content of youth culture today is, to a significant extent,
hip-hop: hip-hop records, hip-hop fashion, hip-hop film, hip-hop
attitude. It is the only genre of popular entertainment that cuts
consistently across class, ethnicity, gender and age. Just as rock music
was a vehicle for the countercultural attitudes that provoked social
upheaval among the middle classes in the 1960s, hip-hop in general and
gangsta rap in particular have carried urban underclass sensibilities to
the wider society--which has reacted with equal parts enchantment,
imitation and outrage.</TE>
<TE>   But in the first half of the 1980s, people in the Los Angeles-based
record industry saw hip-hop as an East Coast fad. Hip-hop's few national
hits were dismissed as novelties. Southern California was in the grip of
a dance epidemic, a local disco fever. A DJ collective called Uncle
Jamm's Army played Culver City east to Pomona; the Dream Team owned
South-Central. A forceful young man named Lonzo Williams worked the clubs
and parties from Gardena to Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Lonzo had been an ardent dancer who started DJing to make money. While
still at Compton High School, he booked house and block parties,
graduating to 1,000-plus-seat venues such as Alpine Village in Torrance
and even the Queen Mary.</TE>
<TE>   Lonzo landed a regular gig at Eve After Dark, a new Compton nightclub.
On Fridays he would spin records from 9 at night until 5 the next
morning, turning the crowd over three or four times. To share the load,
Lonzo in the early 1980s built a team of DJs called Disco Construction;
then, as disco died, the World Class Wreckin' Cru. The Cru played the
usual: Donna Summer, Average White Band, George Clinton, Parliament and
Prince.</TE>
<TE>   Eve was a high-class club--dresses for the ladies and ties and slacks
for the gentlemen. Lonzo dressed his Jheri-curled DJs in matching
lavender outfits and devised Temptations-style choreography. The club
became a fixture on the dance map of Los Angeles. "People came out in
droves," Lonzo recalls. "It was a constant party."</TE>
<TE>   A young Compton kid started hanging around outside Eve, which didn't
serve alcohol but had an age limit. His name was Andre Young. He was 17,
still a student at Centennial High, and already a three-year DJ veteran.</TE>
<TE>   Young pestered Lonzo for a spot on the Cru. On a night when one of the
regulars didn't show, Lonzo gave the new kid a shot.</TE>
<TE>   Lonzo says the key to DJing in such a competitive scene was to "find
the most obscure record you could and play it." Dre was young, but he had
tremendous musical knowledge. He'd been listening forever to his mother's
extensive rhythm-and-blues and jazz record collection. When she came home
after work at night, he once said, the stereo went on before the lights.
He DJed for her and her friends when he was barely school age.</TE>
<TE>   That first night at Eve, Young mixed the old Motown song "Please Mr.
Postman" over Afrika Bambaataa's seminal hip-hop recording, "Planet
Rock"--two songs with completely different tempos and moods. For whatever
reason, it worked.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd went crazy and Lonzo went, "Hmm, what do we have here?"</TE>
<TE>   One of the most popular acts in town at the time was Uncle Jamm's
Army, in which the DJs built identifiable characters--essentially roles
they played onstage. One, a heartthrob named Egyptian Lover, did several
numbers exploring the racier dimensions of his love life. Lonzo admired
Young's musical talent, but even more he saw the good-looking young
ladies' man as a draw, his answer to Egyptian Lover. Young joined the
Wreckin' Cru under the stage name Dr. Dre in honor of Julius Erving, the
basketball player known as Doctor J. Lonzo booked other acts into Eve,
including the first L.A.-area appearances of New York rappers Kurtis Blow
and Run-DMC. When the Wreckin' Cru saw Run-DMC for the first time, they
looked at one another in amazement, recalls Antoine Carraby, a DJ known
as Yella.</TE>
<TE>   Run-DMC was a Eureka moment.</TE>
<TE>   " 'This is it? It's not even a 10-minute show. We can do this.' That's
exactly how it started," says Yella. "We can do this."</TE>
<TE>   They began writing their own material. It didn't seem to matter that
none of them were musicians. Yella could program a drum machine.
Otherwise, they were lost.</TE>
<TE>   "We were DJs. What we knew was partying," Lonzo says. "I can't play
dead. I can't play the radio."</TE>
<TE>   No matter. Dre was naturally musical in a way that most DJs only
dreamed about. Dre and Yella hung out during the day at Eve After Dark,
listening to records, figuring out how to replicate instrumental tracks
on an old four-track recording deck in the back room. It was, Dre says,
how he learned record production.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, they went into Audio Achievements studio in Torrance, where
for $100 they recorded two tracks--one called Slice, the other Kru
Groove. The music--a fast-beat techno sound influenced by the German band
Kraftwerk--consisted mainly of drum tracks programmed by Yella and Dre's
turntable scratching, the distinctive wicky, wicky sound made by
manipulating a turntable by hand. Another member of the group, Marquette
Hawkins, known as DJ Cli-N-Tel, rapped lyrics that mostly said how clever
Yella was to have written them. They took the tracks to Macola Records, a
small, independent label in Hollywood where you could have records
pressed in lots as small as 500. For virtual pocket change, they were now
proud owners of a two-sided, 12-inch dance single. They began selling it
out of the trunk of Lonzo's car to independent record stores throughout
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We sold 5,000 of them," Lonzo says. "Five thousand! That's like
ghetto gold."</TE>
<TE>The New Mall</TE>
<TE>   Steve Yano was a grad student in educational psychology at Cal State
L.A. when he saw an ad on campus for a part-time job delivering records
to stores in the area. Within a year, he found himself part owner of a
record store with the man who had hired him. The store did well enough
but couldn't support them both, so Yano sold his half of the business to
his partner. Yano took payment in merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   "At about this time, the West Coast swap meet scene just blew up,"
Yano says. "I spent the week, Monday through Friday, searching for
product. Hitting all the spots in town, going through used record bins.
Weekends, I'd sell at the meet. I went to every single pawnshop in L.A.
You could buy 10 records for a dollar. I knew I could sell three of them
for two bucks each."</TE>
<TE>   At the peak of disco fever, Yano got a stall at one of the busiest
swap meets in California--the Roadium on Redondo Beach Boulevard in
Torrance. Customers at the Roadium were mainly African American, and Yano
began to tailor his product to fit the customers. "Then there started to
be this new type of talk--R&amp;B, Grandmaster Flash, Kurtis Blow, Run-DMC,"
Yano says. "These guys are popping. Kids are talking about it. Do you
have any 12-inch? Nobody has it. They've never heard of it. Finally, I
found out places you can get some."</TE>
<TE>   Among those sources was Lonzo Williams. Yano called him.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yeah, sure," Lonzo said. "How many you need?"</TE>
<TE>   "Three or four," Yano answered.</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty soon it was, 'I'll take 10 of these. Then 50,' " Yano says.
"Pretty soon Lonzo is coming to me with stuff and I'm carrying 100
titles. I'm selling 100 a week of some of them. The DJ craze hits. Now
everybody and their mother is a DJ and they all want the latest [music].
So they all come to me. I was selling a lot of 12-inch vinyl. I mean, a
lot. Pretty soon other dealers are coming to me. I'm meeting these guys
outside bowling alleys in parking lots at midnight. It was like we were
dealing drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "I become for a while a very important guy. I'm buying 500 copies of a
title. The first place anybody called in L.A. was me. 'Play this. Whattya
think?' All these label guys are starting to bring me their new records.
I could tell the first weekend if something is going to sell just by how
the kids react. If it was good, kids would start to break dance right
there in the stall."</TE>
<TE>   One day, when Yano went to Eve After Dark to meet Lonzo, he heard Dre
and Yella in one of their practice sessions.</TE>
<TE>   KDAY, a local radio station, had converted to an all hip-hop format,
the first station in the country to do so. The station had a daily
feature called Traffic Jam, and it solicited local DJs to make mixes. Dre
and Yella did mixes several times a week--Yella on the drum machine, Dre
scratching on the turntable.</TE>
<TE>   Yano listened, rapt. "Is that how you do it?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "You want us to make you a tape?" Yella answered. Yano took the tape
to the swap meet the next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm playing it," Yano says, "and people go, 'Who did that tape? Can I
 get that?"'</TE>
<TE>Calling Dr. Dre</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1980s, much of the record business had evolved into large
integrated companies that did everything from signing artists, assigning
them producers and songs, then promoting and selling their records
through sales staffs. More and more, the records were marketed through
giant retail chains.</TE>
<TE>   Low profit margins made store rack space too valuable to waste on
unknown artists. This was less true in black communities, where small,
locally owned retailers hung on and where there was an enduring demand
not just for what was popular but for what was novel. These stores
provided an outlet for the new music that the big chains wouldn't risk
stocking. This helped make hip-hop possible in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   While Lonzo worked the local market, Don MacMillan, the owner of
Macola Records, distributed Wreckin' Cru recordings to an informal
network of independent distributors around the country. MacMillan had
several hip-hop acts on Macola. The artists were drawn to him by the easy
terms. He would press records in small quantities and send them out. He
didn't care who was making the records or what was on them.</TE>
<TE>   MacMillan let the artists put their own labels on the recordings and
control their own publishing. Lonzo called his label Kru-Cut Records.</TE>
<TE>   After modest success with its first 12-inch single, the Cru had a hit
with "Surgery," a 1984 number written and produced by Dre that sold
50,000 records--a huge amount for an independently made and distributed
record. "Surgery" was typical of the Wreckin' Cru's music: basic
electronic funk, a fast drum machine beat, lots of turntable scratching
and silly lyrics ("Calling Dr. Dre to surgery").</TE>
<TE>   The Wreckin' Cru started making the transition from dance hall DJs to
recording artists. They followed "Surgery" with "Juice" in 1985 and put
out an album called "World Class" that same year. CBS Records called.
Larkin Arnold, an executive, wanted a meeting. "Larkin was like the black
godfather of music. If he said there was a meeting, there was a meeting,"
Lonzo says.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting went well. Arnold said he'd get back to them, and the
Wreckin' Cru went on tour as an opening act for Rick James. The Cru
measured its success night to night by how many girls they could coax to
their hotel rooms. Most nights, they earned high marks. "We had
showmanship," Lonzo says.</TE>
<TE>   They did their dance steps, wore lace gloves, makeup and rhinestone
satin costumes. These were, in their way, almost quaint reminders of
Lonzo's old-school roots. On the road, Lonzo got a call from his lawyer.
CBS was offering a contract with a $100,000 advance.</TE>
<TE>   Are you interested, the lawyer wanted to know.</TE>
<TE>   "Interested? Sign the damned contract!" Lonzo screamed. "You got power
of attorney. Sign it before they change their minds."</TE>
<TE>   Lonzo pauses at this point in the story. He now owns a small club on
Manchester Boulevard in Inglewood. It's empty in the way that only a
nightclub at noon can be. He looks around and shakes his head.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the worst thing that ever happened," he says. "From that point
on, we had nothing but dissension over money."</TE>
<TE>   Dre complained that Lonzo wasn't paying him enough. He was the musical
foundation of the Wreckin' Cru but was being paid as one of the guys.
That category--one of the guys--meant everybody except Lonzo, who, in his
own defense, says that no one understood how much it cost him to keep the
Wreckin' Cru operating. It was his group; he paid for
everything--advertising, recording costs, travel, equipment. It was only
fair that he be paid more money. The irony was that the more successful
the group became, the worse things got. This had been Lonzo's one big
chance. It left without him. He shakes his head again. "One day you're
cool, the next day you're not. By the time we came off the road, we were
on the down slide," Lonzo says. "Something happened with those guys."</TE>
<TE>Boys Become Boyz</TE>
<TE>   The Wreckin' Cru was Lonzo's group. He decided what music they did. As
much as Dre complained about money, he told friends that he was equally
frustrated with the Wreckin' Cru's musical direction.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm inviting Dre and Yella out to the stall. They're cutting records
right there at the Roadium," Yano says. "Somebody plays it at a party.
Everybody goes, 'What's that?' But you can't get it. You can't buy it
anywhere. It was unbelievable. Dre says, 'Why don't you make a label?' I
said, 'No way.' "</TE>
<TE>   Dre kept asking. Yano kept saying no.</TE>
<TE>   "Then one day," Yano says, "along comes Eazy."</TE>
<TE>   There was no reason to think Eazy-E (Eric Wright) knew anything about
any business but selling dope.</TE>
<TE>   But being a dope man imposed certain career limitations. When he
wandered by Yano's swap meet stall in 1985, at 22, he had resolved to get
a new occupation. He told one friend if all else failed he would do what
his father had done: go to work at the post office.</TE>
<TE>   First, though, he wanted to give the music business a try. And it was
clear to everyone that it was the money more than the music that
interested him.</TE>
<TE>   "Even as a kid, he was a businessman," Yano says.</TE>
<TE>   This was something Dre notably was not. He was a terrible manager of
his own affairs, forever broke. He made matters worse by ignoring money
matters when he could. He racked up parking tickets and traffic
citations, then didn't pay them until the fines doubled or tripled or he
was jailed for not paying at all.</TE>
<TE>   "What you gonna do? Couldn't leave him in jail, you might have a gig
that weekend," Lonzo says.</TE>
<TE>   So Lonzo bailed Dre out repeatedly. Finally, it happened one time too
many. The call came, Dre asked and Lonzo said: "You know what? I'm gonna
let your butt sit in jail for a while. Maybe you'll learn something."</TE>
<TE>   "So he calls Eazy," Lonzo says.</TE>
<TE>   Eazy and Dre cut a deal: Eazy would bail Dre out of jail; Dre would
produce records for Eazy's new record company. Of course, Eazy's record
company existed only in Eazy's mind. The idea of a minor-league dope
dealer starting a record company from scratch was not as preposterous as
it might seem. It was possible to create a virtual record company,
although nobody called it that at the time. The existence of Macola
Records, basically a fee-for-service pressing plant, lowered the bar to
enter the record business to next to nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Macola provided all of the infrastructure to manufacture and
distribute records. Studios could be rented. And the music itself could
be made quickly and cheaply. All Eazy really needed was ambition, which
he had, and Dre.</TE>
<TE>   "They come by the stall one day," Yano says. "I got a guy there doing
T-shirts, spraying them. Eazy says, 'Whattya think of Ruthless? Ruthless
Records?' " "That's cool," Yano said.</TE>
<TE>   And the T-shirt guy painted what would become the logo for Ruthless
Records.</TE>
<TE>Eazy Duz It</TE>
<TE>   Eazy now had a name but still no artists, no material, no plan. Dre
gave him a tape from a New York rap duo called HBO. Eazy agreed to record
them as the debut artists for Ruthless. He booked time at Audio
Achievements, where the Wreckin' Cru records were made. He asked Dre for
a song.</TE>
<TE>   Dre had been writing with O'Shea Jackson, a young Compton MC who lived
four doors down from one of Dre's cousins. Jackson had been writing
rhymes since grade school in L.A.'s Crenshaw district. Dre became a
mentor. He'd pick Jackson up after school and take him along to clubs and
to Lonzo's garage, which they had converted into a ramshackle recording
studio.</TE>
<TE>   Dre produced an album by Jackson, Dre's cousin Jinx and a third
friend, Kid Disaster. They called their group CIA (Criminals In Action).
Jackson adopted the stage name Ice Cube. Like a lot of kids, Cube was a
huge fan of the comedian Richard Pryor. Cube's parents had Pryor's
records, which in addition to being hilarious were exceptionally profane.
Cube listened to the albums when his parents left the house. He started
writing similarly obscene rap parodies of popular songs.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew the value of language, especially profanity. We weren't that
sophisticated, but we knew the power it had," Cube says.</TE>
<TE>   He and Dre started DJing together at clubs and the Compton Skateland
roller rink. Dre would play the instrumental tracks of popular hip-hop
songs and Cube would rap obscene versions of the original lyrics. One of
the highlights was a version of the Run-DMC hit "My Adidas" that Cube
transformed into "My Penis." The Skateland kids loved it. Cube wrote
constantly. "I never stopped," he says. "I had notebooks full of raps."
Among them was one called "Boyz N Tha Hood" that Cube wrote during
English class at Taft High School in Woodland Hills, where he was bused
from South-Central. Cube showed the rhyme to Dre, who made an
instrumental track for it. When HBO showed up in Torrance to record, Dre
gave them "Boyz." HBO balked. Too West Coast, they said, and walked out.
Eazy was stuck with the bill for an empty recording studio. Since Dre,
Cube and the others were already in various groups, Dre urged Eazy to rap
the song. Eazy resisted. He was a businessman. He knew nothing about
rapping. Dre persisted, and with no other option, Eazy did the song.</TE>
<TE>   He had no rap experience or skills, and it showed. It took two days to
make the track. "We all laughed 'cuz it was so bad," Lonzo says.</TE>
<TE>   "Boyz N Tha Hood" is the story of a young man's misadventures with
friends, cars, girls and guns on a single afternoon. It opens with him
"cruisin' down tha street in my '64." He sees a friend driving a stolen
car. He catches another friend trying to steal his car stereo and shoots
him. He has a couple of drinks, gets in a fight with his girlfriend, then
with her father. He wrecks the car and, finally, walking home, sees the
guy with the stolen car from the first verse fight with police. A busy
day. "I can sell that," Yano said.</TE>
<TE>   Eazy took it to Macola, had a pressing done, and Yano started selling
the 12-inch singles at the swap meet.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids are just loving it," Yano says. "We had the best promotion you
could ever get, promotion at the grass-roots street level."</TE>
<TE>   Eazy would drive up to Hollywood, ostensibly to talk to Don MacMillan.
"He'd go to Macola, go into the back room and steal his own records,"
says Lorenzo Patterson, a young rapper whom Eazy recruited to join his
label. "We'd take 'em out through the back door and throw them into his
Jeep."</TE>
<TE>   Eazy hired "snipers"--friends, gangbangers, ordinary guys who wanted
to make a couple bucks--to take the records around to neighborhood
stores. They gave away cassette copies to kids in the projects who were
leaders of their own little cliques.</TE>
<TE>   Against all odds, "Boyz N Tha Hood" became a hit.</TE>
<TE>   "The response told us we'd found our niche, to be ourselves," says
Cube. Eazy persuaded Dre, Cube, Yella and another local rapper named Mik
Lezan, known as the Arabian Prince, to form an all-star group. Dre and
Yella would make the beats; Cube would write the lyrics; Arabian Prince,
Cube and Eazy would rap them. They could all continue to do their own
things and get together on the side to make wild records for Ruthless.</TE>
<TE>   It was an informal collective. People came and went in the studio.
Cube, just out of high school, surprised everybody by leaving town to
take a course in architectural drafting in Arizona. "If this record thing
didn't work out, I didn't want to be out there digging ditches," Cube
says. The Arabian Prince left too--for a solo career. As replacements
Eazy brought in Patterson, who went by the name M.C. Ren, and Tray Curry,
a Texas rapper who performed as The D.O.C. Eazy auditioned Ren in his
mother's Compton garage, where he had recording gear set up. Ren had been
writing rhymes since junior high. He rhymed equations in algebra class</TE>
<TE>   . "He told me to start rapping about anything," Ren says. "So I
started rapping about [stuff] in the garage. He liked it, took the tape
to Dre. Dre signed me on the spot. Took me to a notary public he knew in
Lakewood, signed me to a contract. There was no money or nothing. I
didn't care. I was like, 'Fine.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ren says Eazy's pitch was straightforward: at Ruthless, you could make
records you couldn't make at other labels; it would be a place where
nobody would tell you what you couldn't do. The records would all be like
"Boyz N Tha Hood"--full of sex and guns, drinking and drugging. It would
be stuff their friends would buy. At 24, Yella was the oldest of the
crew. Eazy was 23; Dre, 21; Ren, 20; Cube, 18.</TE>
<TE>   One day, hanging out at the Arabian Prince's house in Inglewood, they
arrived at a name for the new group. They wanted something everybody
would identify with the West Coast. Somebody suggested From Compton With
Love.</TE>
<TE>   "Hell, no!" everyone shouted.</TE>
<TE>   "Then," Ren recalls, "Eazy says, 'How 'bout N.W.A, Niggaz With
Attitude?' Everybody's like, 'Hell, yeah. N.W.A it is.' "</TE>
<TE>The Permanent Business</TE>
<TE>   As the label took shape, Eazy bugged Lonzo for an introduction to
Jerry Heller, a veteran talent manager. Lonzo had met Heller at Macola,
which was a kind of social club for the emerging local hip-hop scene.</TE>
<TE>   "We all heard of Jerry. He was always there at Don's," Lonzo says. "At
one time he had almost everybody on the West Coast signed up. Throw it
against the wall and see what sticks. That's what he was doing."</TE>
<TE>   Lonzo and Heller had become friendly. Lonzo was older than many of the
other guys, and he and Heller had an easy rapport. Lonzo didn't much like
Eazy. For one thing, he thought Eazy was prying Dre away from him.</TE>
<TE>   "The original plan was for Dre to produce Eazy and stay in the Cru,"
Lonzo says. "Dre was enticed by Eazy's lifestyle. He got tired of the
flashy costumes, got tired of practicing the choreography. He wanted to
be a rapper.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fighting for the Wreckin' Cru and I can't compete. There's a
musical divide. I thought their music was good, but I wasn't into it. I
loved ballads."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Lonzo agreed to introduce Eazy to Heller, but he made it
clear he wasn't doing it as a friend. He charged Eazy $750. The
introduction took place in March 1987 in the Macola lobby. "Eazy took the
money out of his sock right there and paid Lonzo," Heller says.</TE>
<TE>   Heller was an old pro, a part of what music people call "the permanent
business." Denizens of the permanent business have a genius mainly for
endurance. They hang around, surfing the erratic waves of popularity that
define pop culture. Heller had made and lost at least one fortune
already. A middle-class, middle-aged, middle-of-the-road white guy with
no musical ability, he had been managing musicians dating back to
Creedence Clearwater Revival in the 1960s. By the 1980s, Heller's
fortunes had declined. He was, he says, "burned out on the industry."</TE>
<TE>   "Then I heard about this scene at Macola, this pressing plant on Santa
Monica Boulevard," Heller says. "For a thousand dollars, he'd press 500
records."</TE>
<TE>   Eazy told Heller about the kind of record company he wanted. Then he
played "Boyz N Tha Hood" and a new N.W.A song, "Straight Outta Compton."</TE>
<TE>   "It blew me away," Heller says. "I thought it was the most important
music I had ever heard."</TE>
<TE>   They agreed to form a partnership and sealed the deal with a drink at
Martini's, a Hollywood hangout. Heller decided that what N.W.A needed
most was better promotion and distribution. That fall, Heller sent the
band on tour and went shopping for a partner. The tour was far from
glamorous. For much of it, N.W.A shared the bill with Salt-N-Pepa, a
group of three women with national hits. Salt-N-Pepa flew between dates
while N.W.A drove in a van.</TE>
<TE>   Salt-N-Pepa found it greatly amusing that the hard-core Compton
"gangsters" had to drive themselves. "Used to laugh at us: 'When y'all's
plane leaving?' " Ren says.</TE>
<TE>   Heller wasn't having a great deal more fun trying to sell the group.
He says Columbia Records executive Joe Smith's reaction, upon hearing a
demo tape, was typical. Smith offered to purchase the name Ruthless,
which he thought had possibilities, but wanted nothing to do with the
records.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you crazy?" Heller remembers Smith asking. "What the hell would
make you believe somebody is going to buy this crap?"</TE>
<TE>   Some evidence was beginning to accumulate that Smith was wrong. Heller
took Eazy to New York to introduce him at an industry gathering. They
were in an elevator at the Park Lane Hotel. The elevator stopped and let
on Joseph Simmons and Darryl McDaniels, the front men for Run-DMC. Heller
and Eazy immediately recognized Simmons and McDaniels, who in turn gave
Heller and, especially, Eazy the once over. Then, recognition having
dawned, Simmons and McDaniels started softly rapping the lyrics to "Boyz
N Tha Hood."</TE>
<TE>   "They knew every word," Heller says. "The record had never been played
on radio anywhere. It's a 12-inch single distributed locally. And they
knew the whole thing." Seizing on the underground success of "Boyz,"
Macola's Don MacMillan compiled that song, a bunch of demos and rough
recordings various people had done under the Ruthless banner and issued
it as an album under the name "N.W.A and the Posse." Only three of the
songs on the album were performed by what would become N.W.A. The record
didn't sell in huge numbers, but it started building N.W.A's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Phillips, a record distributor in Memphis, remembers a call
around this time from one of his accounts, an independent record store in
Cincinnati, asking about a record by a group called N.W.A that was being
played in local clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "I called Macola, bought a couple hundred of them. By the next month
we were reordering five, six, seven thousand a week. As soon as we got
'em, we sold 'em."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, the nephew of Sam Phillips, the man who discovered Elvis
Presley, was a key distributor for Priority Records, a fledgling company
in Los Angeles. He sent Priority a copy of the Macola album. Priority was
the creation of Bryan Turner and Mark Cerami, former K-Tel Records
executives. They had started the label just two years before and made
some money issuing a line of rap compilation albums. Then they hit it big
with an unlikely novelty hit, the California raisins.</TE>
<TE>   Television commercials for the California raisin industry had featured
a musical quartet of animated raisins singing the soul classic "I Heard
It Through the Grapevine." Priority licensed the rights to the singing
raisins and put out an album of soul oldies. They sold 2 million copies.
As a result, Priority was flush with cash and looking for new talent.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, Priority's offices were on the same floor of a
Hollywood building as Jerry Heller's office. Turner, Cerami and Heller
knew one another casually, and Heller had just been in to pitch N.W.A.</TE>
<TE>   Cerami went to see the group perform. It was like the Beatles, he
said. That sealed it. N.W.A was set to follow in the footsteps of the
California raisins.</TE>
<TE>Paint Ball Politics</TE>
<TE>   In the record business, money is spent on two things: recording music
and promoting it. By the time N.W.A went into the studio to make its
first real album, "Straight Outta Compton," a typical studio album cost
well more than $100,000 to produce. Some cost 10 times that much.</TE>
<TE>   The more money that was spent and made, the greater the size of the
record company that would manage it.</TE>
<TE>   One of the great gifts hip-hop gave to the music community was
liberation from these corporate bureaucracies. Most hip-hop records were
being made by small companies on low budgets--"on machines you could buy
for $200 at Toys R Us," Heller says.</TE>
<TE>   The other half of up-front costs--promotion and marketing--is spent
mainly trying to get radio stations to play records. With N.W.A, there
was no chance radio stations were going to touch the stuff, so there was
no sense throwing money at them.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't spend money on radio, so basically you couldn't spend
money," Turner says. This, coupled with low production costs, made the
economics of an N.W.A record utterly different.</TE>
<TE>   "I could sell fifty, sixty, seventy thousand of these records and make
money," Turner says.</TE>
<TE>   With those numbers and with almost no investment, Priority could
afford to both sign N.W.A and leave the group alone. After its brief
tour, N.W.A, with Cube back home from Arizona, went into the studio with
complete freedom to make whatever record they wanted to make. And they
did.</TE>
<TE>   "Straight Outta Compton" has been described variously as a work of
revolutionary genius, a painful scream from the bleak streets of black
America and, more commonly, as reprehensible trash with no redeeming
value. It is all of that, and remains startling because of it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just an image," says Ren. "We got to do something that would
distinguish ourselves. We was just trying to be different."</TE>
<TE>   The fifth word on the first song on "Straight Outta Compton" is
unprintable in The Times. The same word and many variations of it recur
with regularity thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   The record is laced with language you don't hear on the radio or in
polite society. That was the beauty of it and, from the group's point of
view, the joy of it. "We were going to write about the street. Cussing
and hollering," Ren says. They didn't give a damn about polite society,
or anything beyond the narrow world of the low-level street hooligans
they wrote about.</TE>
<TE>   What is most shocking about the album is not the language but the
gleeful, celebratory hedonism of it, the misogyny and violence and
dark-as-midnight nihilism. As a listener, you get the sense you're
learning more about something than you really want to know, something you
might at some point be called to testify about.</TE>
<TE>   When people talk about the album's political and social power, they're
referring mainly to the first three of 13 songs: "Straight Outta
Compton," "F--- Tha Police" and "Gangsta, Gangsta."</TE>
<TE>   The other 10 tracks are party songs, some of them great dance tracks
but lyrically silly and forgettable. Several songs had been recorded
previously and were redone for the album. It is a measure of the power of
the first three songs that they have been able to drown out memory of the
other 10. Dre has at times seemed embarrassed at the rawness of the whole
affair, saying the record was crudely made. Others see this as a virtue,
part of the album's immediacy. The record was made in just six weeks. It
cost about $8,000 and has the loose sense of a bunch of guys having one
hell of a good time--except Ice Cube, who is ferociously angry
throughout.</TE>
<TE>   "Think about how you felt at that age," Cube says. "I was mad at
everything. When I went to the schools in the Valley, going through those
neighborhoods, seeing how different they were from mine, that angered me.
The injustice of it, that's what always got me--the injustice."</TE>
<TE>   The group was not political in any way other than the most elementary
sense. Cube's lyrics were more socially aware than he was. "F--- Tha
Police" was at least as dismissive of the police as it was an attack on
them. The group wasn't even going to record it initially. When Cube first
showed the lyrics to Dre, he passed. "What else you got?" Dre asked.</TE>
<TE>   It was only after Dre and Eazy were caught shooting paint balls at
people at Torrance bus stops that Dre changed his mind about the song.</TE>
<TE>   Cube was the main lyricist for the album. Dre and Yella shared the
producer's credit. They were almost always the first ones in the Torrance
studio and the last to leave. Others came and went as need or whim
dictated. It was clear who was in charge.</TE>
<TE>   "Dre was like the main ear," Ren says. "He'd tell you, 'Try to make it
like this.' You'd do it. He'd be like, 'Cool.' Or, 'That's terrible.'
Dre'd look at you like, you dumb mother . . . ."</TE>
<TE>   The results do not match Dre's later musical sophistication; few
things do. It was, as Priority's Bryan Turner points out, his first real
album. Even so, the sound of the album is as powerful as the lyrics--and
more varied. The fast-beat Wreckin' Cru techno is absent, replaced by
slower, deeper, funkier rhythm tracks set in a scrap heap soundscape of
sirens, gunshots, shouts, curses and cars. The overall effect can be
ominous.</TE>
<TE>   Hip-hop from its beginnings has been intensely place-based. Rappers
have told us about their neighborhoods and towns, praising them and
criticizing others. Regional chauvinism became a defining characteristic;
geographic feuds a part of the drama. N.W.A made a virtue of necessity in
celebrating Compton, a place few people had ever heard of outside
Southern California. To this day, all that many people know of it is what
N.W.A told them. In a way, people read both too much and too little into
"Straight Outta Compton." Too much was made of supposed political
motivations and probably not enough of the fact that these were kids
making records for other kids.</TE>
<TE>   Few people placed the record inside a broader regional tradition to
which it clearly belongs. California pop music in the last 40 years has
had four periods of peak popularity: mid-'60s surf and hot-rod music;
late-'60s psychedelia; '70s laid-back country rock; and gangsta rap of
the late '80s through the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   As distinct as these genres are, they share a notably self-indulgent
worldview. No matter who's singing--Beach Boys, Jefferson Airplane, the
Eagles or Niggaz With Attitudes--or about what, California hedonism
prevails. As Cube put it in "Gangsta, Gangsta," life is just girls and
money, or words to that effect.</TE>
<TE>   In almost any other medium, the same content would have been received
more calmly. It would have been analyzed as an artistic stance, not a
lifestyle. (These weren't, after all, real gangsters.) Dre would have
been exalted as a postmodern master, Frank Gehry at the mixing board,
cobbling scraps of James Brown funk to cool Euro techno in a way that
made both seem more alive. Cube would have been doing political
commentary on CNN and Eazy's autobiography would have been a business
school staple.</TE>
<TE>   People forgot that these were songs, fictions. Almost inevitably,
establishment forces denounced "Straight Outta Compton." It set off a
long-running, unresolved debate about the content of pop culture.</TE>
<TE>   The ubiquity of pop music encourages overreaction; it's the only art
form that blasts out of a 200-watt amp in the Toyota next to you at the
stoplight on Slauson, the artillery thump of the bass vibrating shop
windows a block away. Or, more to the point, the stoplight might be on
Magic Mountain Parkway in Valencia; or any intersection in Bethesda, Md.,
Waukegan, Ill., or Redmond, Ore. Or, for that matter, in Tokyo, Paris or
Rio.</TE>
<TE>   From nearly the beginning, as soon as N.W.A broke out of the swap meet
scene, the group sold most of its records far beyond the boundaries of
black neighborhoods. Eventually, Priority calculated, 80% of the sales of
"Straight Outta Compton" were in the suburbs, mainly to teenage boys who
wouldn't know real niggaz if one woofed in their ears.</TE>
<TE>The FBI Helps Out</TE>
<TE>   The record came out in late 1988. Radio wanted nothing to do with it.
When the group taped a music video, MTV refused to play it. Still, sales
climbed into the hundreds of thousands.</TE>
<TE>   "How did it happen? I was there from the beginning and experienced
pretty much every part of it from up close, and it's still inexplicable,"
says David King, a Priority salesman. "Other labels would ask me how we
did it. I couldn't answer. Basically, we just manufactured and shipped
records. And people kept asking for more."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, "Straight Outta Compton" sold itself.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Phillips, the Memphis record distributor, cites the unusual
relationship between small, black-owned record stores and their
customers. "Black consumers in particular will buy where they can trust
the store. Doesn't matter what it is. We've sold to combination record
store/barber shops, even a pet store/record store."</TE>
<TE>   Turner says the knowledge of distributors such as Phillips was crucial
in getting the record introduced nationally. "Those were the really
critical relationships, with the mom-and-pop stores, because there was a
whole list of them that could actually get your record promoted, get your
record sold because kids would come buy it. There was such a demand for
rap and such a lack of supply."</TE>
<TE>   At first the album received little national attention; sales built
region by region. When it broke within an area, it crossed over to white
markets almost immediately, King says. The hardest part was getting
stores to stock it. "Once you got it in, that's all it took," King says.
"It sold fast with junior high kids. It was illicit, forbidden fruit."</TE>
<TE>   By the middle of 1989, six months after its release, "Straight Outta
Compton" was a stealth phenomenon. Then N.W.A got lucky--perversely so.
Milt Ahlerich, an assistant director of the FBI, sent a letter to
Priority, accusing the label of selling a record ("F---Tha Police") that
encouraged "violence against and disrespect for the law-enforcement
officer." Ahlerich didn't propose to do anything. There was nothing he
could do. He said merely that "we in the law enforcement community take
exception to such action."</TE>
<TE>   The bureau's interpretation of the song was so literal it's a wonder
it didn't form a task force to dig up the bodies that Eazy, Ren and Cube
bragged about dispatching. Bryan Turner didn't know how to react.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared. You kidding? It was the FBI. I'm just a kid from
Canada, what do I know?" Turner says. "I showed it to some lawyers. They
said they [the FBI] couldn't do anything. That made me feel better. Then
we circulated the letter. The thing was like a nuclear explosion. Once we
circulated that, everybody wanted to hear the record the FBI wanted to
suppress."</TE>
<TE>   N.W.A went back on tour. Sure enough, they were banned from performing
in some cities, touching off small riots. Every time it happened, there
was a spate of publicity followed by a spurt in sales. "It was free
publicity as far as I was concerned," Yella says. Bill Adler, a former
rap label executive, says it's simple to identify elements of a hit
record. "Pop music is teen music. The stuff that's going to explode are
the things that appeal to teens. Girls want somebody cute. Boys want
somebody tough."</TE>
<TE>   What could possibly be tougher than to have the FBI after you?</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI helped out," Heller says. "MTV banned the 'Straight Outta
Compton' video and we sold 100,000 copies. A whole cultural phenomenon.
Several months into it, Elle did a 10-page spread on gangster chic in the
foreign edition. We did a Newsweek cover." N.W.A woke the music industry
to the huge commercial possibilities of hard-core hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually people quit asking if hip-hop was a fad. Rap music worked
its way on to the radio, dominated it to some extent, ending what had
been a decade of de facto radio racial segregation. Hip-hop, now
dominated by gangsta rap descendants, is the best-selling music in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "The economics of it were staggering. Just staggering," Heller says.
If you were with Warner Bros., for example, and you sold 500,000 records,
they might drop you from the label. The way we were doing it, if you sold
200,000 records you made a quarter million dollars. And you made it right
there. We'd take the check to the bank, cash it and split it up on the
corner."</TE>
<TE>   Whether all of the checks were for the right amount would later become
a subject of much debate and litigation, but for the time being N.W.A was
riding down Main Street in the biggest parade any of them had ever
imagined.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the things that had to happen for "Straight Outta Compton" to
become a hit record.</TE>
<TE>   It required an economic catastrophe to overwhelm metropolitan Los
Angeles, leaving African American neighborhoods in shambles, their
residents in despair. It required a crack epidemic to then sweep through
those same streets, offering more misery but also complicated
opportunities that enriched people such as Eric Wright.</TE>
<TE>   It required the invention of the VCR and the sudden, unforeseen
decline of drive-in movie theaters, creating the space where new American
bazaars--the swap meets--would rise. It required the existence of Macola
Records, an old-school oddity hanging on in a new-school world, and the
persistence of inner-city, word-of-mouth recommendations in an age of
mass-media dominance. It apparently even required the existence of
animated raisins lip-synching Marvin Gaye records.</TE>
<TE>   This history is a crooked street, crowded with more happy accidents
than are comfortable to contemplate. It begins to seem like fate. It
begins to seem as if Puffy Combs might have underestimated Dr. Dre when
he said, "Dre is to rap what God is to the church."</TE>
<TE>I Shot a Man in Reno</TE>
<TE>   Here are sample lyrics from yet another song without redeeming social
value:</TE>
<TE>   "Early one morning while makin' the rounds,</TE>
<TE>   I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my baby down</TE>
<TE>   I shot her down then I went to bed,</TE>
<TE>   I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head."</TE>
<TE>   The song continues with the protagonist chased and caught by police,
then sent to prison. In the last verse, unrepentant to the end, he
laments that he "can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down." He
regrets only getting caught.</TE>
<TE>   Rap critics would be right in finding very little social uplift in
this song, "Cocaine Blues," recorded by Roy Hogshead. Hogshead, however,
was not a rap star. He didn't even have a nickname.</TE>
<TE>   He recorded this song in 1947, and at least five versions of it have
been made since. Johnny Cash sang it on his best-selling "Live at Folsom
Prison" album in 1968. Nobody protested or even noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Light, founding editor of Vibe magazine, an influential hip-hop
publication, says he asked Cash about the potential harmful effects of
rap lyrics. Cash referred back to the Folsom Prison record, specifically
to the title song, which includes the line, "I shot a man in Reno just to
watch him die." You know, Cash said, I don't recall ever hearing about
anyone listening to that song, then going to Reno and shooting somebody.</TE>
<TE>   Neither, as far as anyone knows, has anybody killed a police officer
after hearing N.W.A's "F--- Tha Police." So why did the FBI send a letter
to N.W.A? Alan Light contrasts the reception of rap music with that of
other popular arts that sometimes celebrate violence. Some of the best
movies ever made--the "Godfather" series, for example--are exceptionally
violent, and no one attempts to ban them. Dre points this out when he
compares "Straight Outta Compton" to "Pulp Fiction." His songs are dark
comedies, he says; he wonders why people don't see that.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference is the level of respect accorded not to the artists
but to the audience," Light says. The audience for movies is presumed to
know better, to distinguish fact from fiction. The hip-hop audience,
presumably, cannot.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's the key to understanding the feelings "Straight Outta
Compton" aroused, the success it enjoyed and the effects it continues to
have. Maybe it disguises its fictional base too well. It's too real. When
N.W.A shouted at you, you were compelled to shout back. N.W.A was
together in its most potent lineup for less than two years.</TE>
<TE>   Cube, financially frustrated, left before the end of 1989 for a highly
successful solo career. He has since become a screenwriter, actor and
movie producer, a virtual corporation unto himself. The other four
members put out two more N.W.A records, but to considerably less effect.</TE>
<TE>   Dre split acrimoniously from Ruthless in 1992 to help form Death Row
Records, where he recorded the second most influential hip-hop album
ever, "The Chronic," which defined the sound of rap for a decade. He has
discovered and produced two of the biggest individual stars in hip-hop
history--Snoop Dogg and Eminem.</TE>
<TE>   Ren and Yella have had more limited solo careers. Ren is still
recording, while Yella has a pornographic movie production business. Eazy
continued to run Ruthless and to record until his death from AIDS in
1995. There continues to be talk of a reunion, with Snoop taking Eazy's
spot.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever comes of that, N.W.A had more of an effect in less time than
probably any figures in pop music history. It's as if Sinatra had become
Sinatra by cutting a single record, as if Dylan quit before going
electric. N.W.A incited a revolution that redefined hip-hop just as
hip-hop was poised to overrun popular culture. As pop has increasingly
become the culture that matters, hip-hop has reached deep into mainstream
America.</TE>
<TE>   It really was the beginning of the end of life as we knew it. The
beginning of the end, it turned out, was accompanied not by heavenly
choirs but a rhythm section.</TE>
<TE>   This is not an idle point. Rhythm is a drug. Maybe, like medicine, it
should never be consumed in combination with other dangerous substances.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's what happened with "Straight Outta Compton." Maybe by
combining deadly rhythm with taboo subjects--violence and sex and
drugs--it gathered unprecedented strength. Maybe it was unstoppable; just
too powerful, too forceful.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, in other words, it was just too damn good.</TE>

<LD>I'm standing in a hotel lobby in Lone Pine when I hear a voice from
behind me: "I've been dreaming of the Sierra." I turn and find a strange
little man gazing out the window at the peaks to the West. Is he talking
to me?</LD>
<LD>   "I'm from Scotland and, oh sure, we have beautiful mountains there.
But not like this. No, no, not like this. That's why I dream of the
Sierras." He doesn't seem to expect a response. He smiles wistfully and
slips out of the room.</LD>
<LD>   My first thought is, "Did that really happen?" But then I realize that
he has, in a way, articulated my own thoughts. I've been dreaming of the
Sierra too. It's been my goal to climb Mt. Whitney since I was a kid
growing up in New England, reading stories of the Old West.</LD>
<TE>   When I was young, I suffered from insomnia. So I'd read Westerns late
into the night until I thought I could sleep. Then I'd stare at the map
of the United States on my wall, the Western states illuminated by a
street light out front. Finally drifting into sleep, my imagination would
be filled with the magical names of the West, the Rocky Mountains, the
Bitterroot Range and, yes, the Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   So now, at age 49, I'm standing in the lobby of the Dow Villa Hotel,
where John Wayne bunked while he filmed Westerns in the nearby Alabama
Hills. These parts were also frequented by another hero of mine--Humphrey
Bogart played Mad Dog Earle, a bank robber on the lam, in "High Sierra."
Tomorrow I'll finally be in those mountains too, climbing the highest
peak in the U.S.--or, at least, the Lower 48 states--at 14,497 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "It's crunch time," says another voice. It's my brother, Pete, who has
come out from the East to climb with me. "We have to be up in
six-point-five hours so we better rack out." He's a civil engineer who
somehow corrects me each time I cite a mileage, find magnetic north or
read a map.</TE>
<TE>   Back in high school, Pete and I climbed most everything New
Hampshire's White Mountains had to offer--including Washington, Adams,
Chocorua. Despite the danger of wickedly unpredictable weather
conditions, those mountains now seem so tame. The trail head for Mt.
Whitney, at 8,360, is more than 2,000 feet above the summit of Mt.
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Our climb is a reunion of sorts. Pete stayed in the East and works on
the roads and bridges of New England. I ventured west to spin yarns as a
California writer. Tomorrow we'll climb together for the first time in
decades. Though we're not young bucks anymore, we'll need the strength
and stamina of youth; it's a 22-mile round-trip with an elevation gain of
more than 6,000 feet. Most people do it in two days. We'll gut it out in
one 16-hour grind.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to be able to say that I did it," Pete explained to me
some months ago when we planned the trip.</TE>
<TE>   Bragging rights. It's what everyone wants. It's what I've said all
these years since the urge first hit me. But is there something else
pushing me?</TE>
<TE>   The alarm rings in the darkness of our room six-point-five hours
later, followed by my brother's sleepy voice: "It's crunch time. Let's
hit the trail." A glance at the clock: 3:30 a.m. We had set out
everything the night before--water bottles, energy bars, wind breakers.
We gulp coffee, gobble oatmeal and head for the car.</TE>
<TE>   Outside it's cool and absolutely still. Looking down the main street
of Lone Pine, I see sputtering neon signs for cafes, bars and sporting
goods stores with names that include "Bonanza" and "The Totem." The only
fast-food chain is at the north end of town. How much longer can Lone
Pine escape discovery? Each time I drive back into town from my home in
Southern California, I brace myself for the inevitable invasion of
corporate logos. Thankfully, the ghost of the Duke still roams these
streets. But once Wal-Mart arrives, he'll get the hell out of Dodge.</TE>
<TE>   We drive up a snaking road to the Whitney Portal and park across from
the trail head. We don headlamps so we can see the trail. And begin
hiking.</TE>
<TE>   "Look up," Pete says. Above me are the brightest stars I've ever seen
outside of a "Star Wars" movie. Constellations leap out; every point of
light belongs to a bear, a hunter or a crab. For a moment, I feel like a
real mountain man, navigating by the heavens. Then I turn my headlamp
back on, chomp on a high-protein bar and hit the trail.</TE>
<TE>   After several hours, the sky behind us pales. Then the rising sun
strikes a rock face high above us with a yellow brilliance. It's hard to
imagine that we'll be above those peaks later today.</TE>
<TE>   Soon we reach a barren, boulder-strewn landscape with scattered
snowfields. Above, the east wall of Mt. Whitney looks down, challenging
us. The hardest part is about to begin--96 switchbacks that will take us
2,000 feet up to Trail Crest at 13,777 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Pete decides to count the switchbacks to take our minds off the
ordeal. At the end of each 10, he high-fives me to boost our spirits.
It's during this section of the trail that we meet the hiker we refer to
as "our man." He's a quiet young man, climbing alone. He passes us,
asking questions about elevations and distances. Then we pass him and he
fades into the distance. "I don't think our man's going to make it," Pete
says, regretfully.</TE>
<TE>   We round yet another switchback and Pete triumphantly yells,
"Ninety-six!" And, what do you know? He's counted correctly--we've
reached Trail Crest. We stand there panting, amazed at what we see. A
huge wilderness area lies before us unscarred by a single road. The area
stretches untamed from Highway 395 in Lone Pine, through Sequoia National
Park and into the San Joaquin Valley near Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   We're now nearly three miles high, and each lungful of air is
pathetically thin. Ten steps forward, no matter how slowly I walk, leaves
me panting. In the stillness I feel my heart thudding in my chest, each
beat racking my body. I don't like being so aware of my heart. It's like
marking my remaining time on earth with solemn drumbeats.</TE>
<TE>   After an hour we drop exhausted onto a rock beside the trail. A woman
rounds the corner from the opposite direction and sits beside us. She's
dressed in a nylon wind breaker, wool hat and gloves. "It's blowing
pretty good on top," she explains. Then, tugging at her clothes she
announces, "Time to strip."</TE>
<TE>   "Climbed--Whitney--before?" I ask between gasps.</TE>
<TE>   "Seven times since August," she informs us, peeling off layers of
clothes, revealing painted-on spandex shorts. "Once, my friend and I
summitted twice in 24 hours."</TE>
<TE>   "What's your best time up and back?" my brother demands.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten hours," she says as she stands. She's gone before it registers:
We have already been on the mountain for 10 hours--and we haven't even
been to the summit yet. Hey, it's the journey, I remind myself, not the
destination.</TE>
<TE>   During the next hour we cross behind the jagged teeth of needle-sharp
spires of rock. The wind roars like a jet taking off, nearly knocking us
off our feet. We reach a vast, rock-strewn slope and, finally, we see our
goal: a rock shelter marking the summit. But it looks impossibly distant,
unreachable.</TE>
<TE>   During this last section I lapse into a dreamlike state. There's only
one thought in my mind: I have to reach the top. I could, at any point,
tell Pete, "I've hit the wall. Go to the top and I'll wait here." But
something pushes me on. I've come this far and I'm going to finish it.
Hikers pass us. We pass other hikers. The wind rips at our clothes and
freezes our exposed hands. I remember Pete yelling over the wind, "This
is definitely crunch time!"</TE>
<TE>   At last, the rock shelter appears silhouetted against the achingly
blue sky. Seeing it gives me a burst of energy and I arrive at a white
plaque, cemented to a boulder, proof that we are standing on the highest
point in the Lower 48 states.</TE>
<TE>   "Could you take my picture?"</TE>
<TE>   It's our man, the soft-spoken guy whom we saw much earlier. He made
it! I take his camera as he stands atop a boulder and, just before I snap
the picture, he flashes the peace sign. Now it's our turn to pose. My
brother puts his arm around my shoulder. I smile broadly, hoping my
expression says, "Piece of cake." Inside, I'm thinking, how did I ever
make it? What drove me despite lack of conditioning and all common sense?</TE>
<TE>   The answer comes in the wind-whipped voice from my brother. "Remember
that map on your bedroom wall? I'd always come into your room and you'd
be staring at it." Of course I remember it. And now I understand why I'm
here. Over the years, those places became a guiding light to me, moving
me west, leaving my family behind in the East, to claim the dreams of
childhood.</TE>
<TE>   I put my arm around my brother and pose for one more picture. It's
been a long trail to get here. But I finally made it.</TE>

<DH>California's Director of Mental Health  Wants a Uniform Standard
for the Release of the State's Sexually Violent Predators. His.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Patrick Henry Ghilotti, known as the Lincoln Avenue Rapist for
attacking nearly a dozen women in the wealthy Marin County town of San
Rafael, was looking forward to Christmas 2001. It promised to be the
first holiday that the 46-year-old sex offender would spend as a free man
in almost two decades.</LD>
<LD>   From the time he was 22, the son of a prosperous construction magnate
had been in prisons and mental hospitals more than he had been out. He'd
been convicted of breaking into homes in the early morning hours and
sexually assaulting women in a misguided quest to find his "soul mate."</LD>
<LD>   Since 1997, Ghilotti has been locked in Atascadero State Mental
Hospital, where California keeps its 345 sexually violent predators, or
SVPs, those who have served their time and are no longer in jail. Upon
finishing their sentences, the state recommends them for civil commitment
for mental illness to the high-security facility near San Luis Obispo.
Many SVPs claim the law is just a one-way ticket into an animal factory.</LD>
<TE>   But Ghilotti accepted the treatment, perhaps believing the state
department of mental health's tough rhetoric that completing the program
was the quickest way out of Atascadero. So, after finishing four years of
intensive therapy and having served 12 years in his most recent prison
term, Ghilotti felt he was no longer a danger to society. Well within his
legal rights, he petitioned the court to let him out. He hoped he would
be the first sexually violent predator to be released, albeit
conditionally, into the liberal Northern California enclave of Marin
County.</TE>
<TE>   Marin prosecutors objected, but the judge claimed his hands were tied.
Politicians chimed in their concern, and Ghilotti's past victims began to
speak out. Still the court remained on Ghilotti's side, and a release
date was put on the calendar for late last year. Stephen Mayberg, head of
California's Department of Mental Health, saw a loophole in the law that
gave him one last chance to keep Ghilotti at Atascadero. His plan was a
legal long shot, but he knew it was the state's only hope for keeping in
custody a man that Mayberg feels may still pose a threat to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Mayberg's interpretation of the law put him at the center of a debate
that quickly traveled to the California Supreme Court. At issue is how
the state's rapidly growing population of sexually violent predators
should be handled--and who decides when they are ready to go free. To
supporters, Mayberg's gambit could make him a last line of defense in
keeping some serial sex offenders off the streets until they no longer
pose a danger. To detractors, he's nothing more than an overreaching
bureaucrat, bending laws to suit his purposes and cater to political
expediencies.</TE>
<TE>   When the court rules in the next few weeks, Mayberg will either gain
important power or be forced to rubber-stamp release recommendations for
sexually violent predators. In the meantime, arguments continue about
whether Stephen Mayberg is just being vigilant--or a vigilante.</TE>
<TE>   With a round frame, balding pate and vibrant blue-green eyes that
crinkle when he laughs, Mayberg resembles an out-of-season Santa. It is
Valentine's Day, and the 55-year-old clinical psychologist is lunching at
Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino, where he is visiting for a
quarterly meeting. The staff has prepared the kind of dismally festive
fare that doesn't try to disguise its institutional origin: A pile of
potato salad vaguely shaped into a heart, trays of supermarket sandwich
fixings, crudites surrounding a decorative duck made of squash, and red
"hospital punch" in plastic pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   Known for his ability to put others at ease, Mayberg is jovial and
smiling, determined to charm, until the subject of sexually violent
predators arises. Then his eyes take on a harder, flatter edge and you
can see the stalwart side of his personality. "They are the high school
seniors of the institutionalized population," he says between bites of a
roast beef sandwich. He calls SVPs some of the most "manipulative"
patients in the state system because they are often intelligent, highly
functioning individuals who don't believe they need mental care.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really clear that at this stage there is not a cure for
sexually violent predators," he adds later. "I don't know that I'm
necessarily the last line of defense, but I think I have an obligation to
be honest and objective, and if I think that there are risks, I have an
imperative to articulate that. I sort of have two clients here. I have to
figure out how to deal with the sexually violent predator, and also how
to prevent traumatization of innocent folks. The toll this kind of
inappropriate behavior takes on everyone is huge. And if I'm really a
mental-health clinician at heart, we need to look at how we prevent
people from being traumatized."</TE>
<TE>   If SVPs are the high school seniors of mental patients, then Patrick
Henry Ghilotti is their valedictorian. Since the SVP law was enacted in
1996, he is one of only two SVPs to complete all four levels of the
state's inpatient treatment program, and the first to qualify for the
coveted level five--community release. When Ghilotti reached phase four
last year, he petitioned the courts to allow him to return to the streets
of Marin County, where he committed his crimes. Last Aug. 1, the Marin
County courts acquiesced and ordered the department of mental health to
draw up a list of rules for Ghilotti's impending discharge. But no one
was sure what those rules should be because no SVP in California has ever
been admitted into a "conditional release," or CONREP program.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent four or five months developing a community release plan that
was really comprehensive," Mayberg says. "Some people thought it was too
comprehensive, but we thought each of the decisions we made was
important."</TE>
<TE>   The plan required Ghilotti to wear an ankle bracelet connected to a
global positioning system, restricted him from using the Internet and
forbade him from seeing his wife without supervision. Evaluators feared
that she added too much stress to his life. It also stipulated that
Ghilotti would continue to use a Lupron implant, a drug that lowers his
testosterone level to prepubescent levels, in effect giving him a
chemical castration. "It's nothing more than naked punishment under a
therapeutic guise," Ghilotti's public defender, Frank Cox, says of the
plan. "When the terms of the CONREP program were more restrictive than
[what he faced in] prison, Patrick said it's time to talk to the
evaluators about whether I need to be in this program at all" after his
release.</TE>
<TE>   Understanding Patrick Ghilotti's past is critical to understanding why
he might need restrictions in the future, and why Mayberg chose this case
to make his stand when about a dozen SVPs already have been released.</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti began his adult criminal career prowling along Lincoln
Avenue, a residential street just north of San Rafael in Marin County. He
committed his first crime around 3 a.m. on July 21, 1977. Armed with a
knife, he broke into a house where three female roommates slept,
according to court records. He woke them up, one at a time, and ordered
them into a bedroom, where he assaulted them.</TE>
<TE>   Three days after Christmas that year, Ghilotti broke into an apartment
in his own complex and raped a woman. Ghilotti's third known offense
didn't go as well. In an August 1978 incident, the victim grabbed his
wrist, got him in a hammerlock and bit his hand. When her screams
summoned a roommate, Ghilotti fled.</TE>
<TE>   Six days later, he attacked a woman at night in her home, forcing her
to masturbate him. Eight days after that, he crawled through a bedroom
window, holding a knife and wearing a bandanna to cover his face. He
found the woman in her living room watching TV and attempted to force her
into a sex act. Court records show that she asked him why he was
attacking her, when he was handsome enough to attract a woman without
force. He replied, "This is how I get my kicks."</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the attacks, Ghilotti was married to his high-school
girlfriend  and had an infant daughter. He told evaluators that his
wife's decision to get a job put him under too much stress, triggering
his crimes. "She was changing into someone who was completely different
from who I married," Ghilotti told psychologists. "She wanted to go out
and get a job and not devote herself totally to the family and raising
our daughter. She knew what I wanted when we got married. We had an
understanding. When she changed, I felt rejected."</TE>
<TE>   A fingerprint at a crime scene and various victim identifications led
to Ghilotti's first conviction in March 1979. Found guilty of three
counts of forcible oral copulation from his first offense, he was sent to
Atascadero State Hospital as a mentally disordered sex offender. That's
the term for prisoners with mental disorders that may have contributed to
their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti didn't last long during his first stay at Atascadero. By
1983, he was deemed "not amenable to treatment," according to court
records, and sent to Solano State Prison to serve the remainder of his
sentence. Records show that Ghilotti felt that he "got nothing out of"
his stay at Atascadero because he "wasn't a rapist anyway."</TE>
<TE>   One thing the now-divorced Ghilotti did get out of his time at
Atascadero was a new wife. He had met psychiatric technician Janet
Frankhouser and begun a friendship. Frankhouser and Ghilotti began dating
after his parole in 1984. Within months, Ghilotti was living with her.
But when that relationship began to get tense, he moved out. "She put her
foot down and I reacted badly to that," Ghilotti told an evaluator.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks of that breakup, Ghilotti began his second crime spree.
In April 1985, a Marin woman awoke to find Ghilotti pinning her to the
mattress. He told her, "You can do this willingly or you can do this by
force." He ended up fondling her breasts and leaving.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, a Marin woman was awakened as Ghilotti reached across
her bed to unscrew a lightbulb. He molested her, but did not rape her,
perhaps because the woman's daughter returned home and scared him off. He
was again arrested, tried and convicted--this time for forcible genital
penetration.</TE>
<TE>   Frankhouser, who had reunited with Ghilotti and married him after his
second arrest, testified that her husband had been under emotional strain
since his parole. His father had suffered a stroke and one of his
brothers had pressured him to work long hours at the family construction
business. She said that pressure, combined with the increasing stresses
from their relationship, had triggered his second wave of attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti returned to prison and was due to be freed in 1997. But in
1996, lawmakers created the "sexually violent predator" designation and
mandated that when a sex offender finishes prison time, the state can
recommend that the offender be sent to a mental hospital for two years if
two independent psychologists find him or her likely to commit sexual
crimes again, and a jury agrees. That hospitalization can be extended
indefinitely if, during an evaluation every two years, two independent
evaluators continue to find the patient at risk and prosecutors
successfully petition to extend the commitment. Ghilotti became one of
the first to get the SVP designation--and lose his chance for freedom.</TE>
<TE>   This time at Atascadero, however, he joined the treatment program
after his second sentence ended and excelled, even voluntarily taking a
second two-year commitment to finish the four steps. He began to examine
why he attacked women, and what his motivations were. Ghilotti told an
evaluator, "It makes me feel powerful, in control, to do this amazing
thing of waking up a woman who should be screaming and making her calmly
have sex with me. . . . What I was after was to do the coercion thing,
and then get them to reach out to me in an emotional way. . . . By
reaching out to me emotionally, it would mean that it is the kind of
person who could see what was going on with me. . . . And if that person
would reach out to me, that would be something real. What I did in
retrospect was a cowardly and sick thing, but when I get into this frame
of mind, I get beyond that."</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti claims that his mother beat him with a rolling pin and his
father with a bullwhip, and that the childhood abuse by his now-deceased
parents left him unable to relate to women. He says his rapes, triggered
by stress with family members, were really a search for understanding, a
quest for a woman who, by submitting, could see the person he really is.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations for Ghilotti's conditional release fell apart late  last
fall, when Ghilotti refused to accept the restrictions. Stephen Mayberg
was in a bind.</TE>
<TE>   His department believed that with Ghilotti's history, each of the
rules was imperative in keeping him away from emotional and psychological
triggers, thereby preventing him from repeating his crimes. But
Ghilotti's commitment was set to expire Dec. 1, with or without an
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The state had been prepared for Ghilotti's conditional release to fall
through, and had hired psychologists to evaluate Ghilotti for
recommitment before negotiations broke down. It expected evaluators to
rule that Ghilotti still qualified as an SVP and should remain at
Atascadero for another two years. But all of the evaluators found that
Ghilotti's seemingly sincere dedication to treatment and rapid progress
through the program steps demonstrated that he no longer qualified as a
sexually violent predator. That meant that even if he continued to refuse
the requirements of the conditional release program, he would walk out of
Atascadero on the first Saturday in December with absolutely no
restrictions and no supervision.</TE>
<TE>   However, Mayberg saw room for interpretation in the SVP law. As it's
written, the psychologists who evaluate a sexually violent predator give
their reports to the director of the department of mental
health--Mayberg, in this case--who then recommends to prosecutors that
they petition to either continue to hold the felon, or decide the person
is no longer a threat. Usually, the director simply echoes the opinion of
the evaluators. But Mayberg interpreted the wording of the law to mean
that he was not required to agree with the examining doctors. Even though
three independent psychologists had concluded that Ghilotti no longer was
a sexually violent predator, Mayberg decided that he could, in essence,
evaluate the evaluators and draw his own conclusion. That interpretation
would allow him to act as an overseer of the SVP program, ensuring that a
cohesive standard--his--applies across the board. His conclusion: Patrick
Ghilotti remains a dangerous man.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say Mayberg's maneuver was based as much on politics as
ethics. To allow a sexually violent predator to walk back into the rich,
Democratic enclave of Marin during an election cycle was not a
possibility that Gov. Gray Davis or any other elected official was happy
to contemplate.</TE>
<TE>   "For the attorney general, for the governor, it is, of course, highly
political," says attorney Ron Boyer, who helped present Ghilotti's
defense arguments on behalf of the California Public Defenders Assn. and
California Attorneys for Criminal Justice. "It's a hot-button issue in
its way."</TE>
<TE>   Cox, Ghilotti's defense attorney, says: "It surprised me to hear on
the radio statements directly from Gov. Davis that he wanted Patrick
Ghilotti locked up. Somehow there is a political dimension to this case
that I didn't create. It came from the press, it came from politicians
and it's hard to cope with that. Patrick Ghilotti should not have to bear
the burden of being someone's campaign platform."</TE>
<TE>   "Was I ordered to do this?" counters Mayberg. "Absolutely not. Were
[Davis' staff] engaged in what was going on? Absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   That position is seconded by Davis' staff. "Clearly the governor was
aware that there was some fear in the community," says spokesman Steve
Maviglio. But as for Davis influencing Mayberg's position, he says, "It
was the other way around."</TE>
<TE>   Mayberg is a gubernatorial appointee, but he has the rare distinction
of having survived a party change without losing his position. He was
appointed by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson in 1993, when the state
Department of Mental Health suffered from constantly changing
leadership--14 directors in 20 years--and criticism both from those it
served and the state's legislators. Some had recommended abolishing the
department and leaving mental health care in control of the counties.</TE>
<TE>   As director of the Yolo County mental health program, Mayberg had been
one of the department's harshest critics. "What they said was, 'Put up or
shut up,' " he recalls. "And I realized that that was a legitimate
criticism. Too often in our system, it's too easy for people to be Monday
morning quarterbacks. So I took the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   During his nine-year tenure at the Department of Mental Health, the
Minnesota native, whose father and grandmother were respected
mental-health professionals, is credited with creating a system that goes
out of its way to accommodate those it serves, and has built strong
relationships with officials in law enforcement and other areas of
government. He also helped secure approval for a new $365-million,
1,500-bed mental hospital being built in Coalinga to house sexually
violent predators. The state's SVP population grows by three each month.</TE>
<TE>   "He listens to all sides. He doesn't always agree, but you know you
have a fair hearing," says Darlene Prettyman, a psychiatric nurse who
serves on numerous mental health committees. She adds that Mayberg is
nicknamed the "Rhinoceros" because he's "got an armor around him, but
he's got a soft heart."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Mayberg critics are few and far between. "He's the kind of
guy who can tell you no and make you feel good about it," says Andrea
Jackson, chief of staff to Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento),
who works on mental-health issues. "He's not a pushover. Steve Mayberg
has the ability to be both pleasant and firm at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Mayberg credits that to his ability to empathize. As a clinical
psychologist, he has treated patients one-on-one, even spearheading Yolo
County's suicide-prevention program. On the personal side, he was born
with a deformed right hand, something he says is "part of who I am. It's
something that most of the time I forget about, but certainly something I
didn't forget about growing up." The experience of being different from
other kids taught him "we need to find those areas where we have
strength."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to sexually violent predators, Mayberg says he draws on
that empathy to consider what is best for the patient, and how to best
reintroduce that person in a way that will assuage community fears and
give the patient the best chance of staying crime-free. Supervised
therapy is the only safe long-term solution, he says, adding that
Ghilotti's chances of success are slim without supervised therapy outside
of Atascadero. "I try to explain to people it's sort of like cancer,"
says Mayberg of SVP treatment. "If you went into the hospital with a
tumor, you'd have whatever procedure, a lumpectomy or a mastectomy, but
then you would be discharged from the hospital. But there is an
expectation that you would continue some treatment. You can't just say it
ends at the inpatient stage. That's only for the acute state of
treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Time was running out for Ghilotti's inpatient stay. Last Nov. 28, the
Marin County district attorney filed a recommitment petition, using
Mayberg's argument that he had final authority on release
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Mayberg also wrote in a letter to the court: "[It] is my opinion that
each evaluator makes a threshold case in the body of each report that Mr.
Ghilotti is 'likely' to re-offend. Accordingly, I am recommending
extension of commitment because I believe that Mr. Ghilotti, as a result
of his mental disorder, is likely to engage in sexually violent criminal
behavior, and thus continues to meet the legal requirement for sexually
violent predator civil commitment."</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti protested, and two days later the court denied Mayberg's
argument. Prosecutors appealed, but the appeals court also refused to
stay Ghilotti's release. At 6:30 p.m. on Nov. 30--one day before
Ghilotti's unconditional release--the California Supreme Court agreed to
hear the case and decide on the scope of Mayberg's power. The court also
added two more issues to the debate--whether the courts have the right to
review the evaluators' reports, and what "likely" means when it comes to
committing people "likely to re-offend." The court ordered Ghilotti to
remain at Atascadero until its ruling, which is expected within the next
few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti was "confused and he was speechless," Cox says of his client.
"He had been preparing for months for a return to the community, and to
have this happen at the last hour was confusing and deeply disheartening.
Patrick doesn't belong in the justice system. He finished his prison term
over four years ago."</TE>
<TE>   But Ghilotti's disappointment was Mayberg's victory--for now. When the
court gives its verdict, most legal experts believe Mayberg will lose on
his position.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be an extraordinary way to read the statute," scoffs
attorney Boyer of Mayberg's stand. He adds that the state Supreme Court
seemed unimpressed by the state's position during oral arguments, with
Justice Kathryn Werdegar telling the state attorney presenting Mayberg's
case that she found it "hard to read" the law in his favor. The
additional issues raised by the court may still keep Ghilotti in
Atascadero for a while. However, few, including Mayberg, think
California's mental hospitals should be permanent warehouses for the most
fearsome sex offenders.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think my job is to be locking someone up forever," Mayberg
says. "That's why I think sexually violent predators represent a unique
challenge. They don't engender any empathy from anybody. What they've
done is egregious. But people forget that I'm only recommending based on
my expertise and knowledge. It's still a court decision, a jury decision.
I'm just saying, 'Please, listen to me.' "</TE>

<DH>A Traditional Pasadena Craftsman Home Gets an Angular 21st Century
Addition</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA THORNBURG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bicoastal architectural designer Joseph Giovannini was having a
perfectly pleasant conversation with a woman behind the counter at the
Planning Department's Design and Historic Preservation window in
Pasadena, until he rolled out the plans for his modern addition to a 1907
Craftsman bungalow. "She suddenly pursed her lips and said, 'Oh my, this
is radical,' " he recalls. Luckily on a later try, a more open-minded
member of the review board, who had an appreciation for Modernism, saw
integrity in the addition and approved the project.</LD>
<LD>   The idea for the 250-square-foot addition was the result of
dinner-party banter in 1999. Giovannini, former architecture critic for
the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, and Caltech professor emeritus and
best-selling author Dan Kevles were chatting about the latter's plans to
remodel his Pasadena Craftsman home. "I'd always wanted a modern study
with lots of light and glass overlooking a garden," says Kevles.</LD>
<LD>   To Giovannini, the project presented an interesting challenge. The
home's previous 1977 addition--a guest bedroom/den--had maxed out the
floor space permitted by the city. "We weren't allowed to add a
millimeter of footage," says the designer. Giovannini, along with Kevles
and wife Bettyann, decided to transform the guest bedroom/den space off
the kitchen into a light-filled office and sitting area.</LD>
<TE>   "The only way I could make a difference was to add volume and
essentially explode the box," says Giovannini, who raised the 8 1/2-foot
ceiling up to a lofty 17 feet, adding a canted roof with tilted
clerestory windows. The effect is of a futuristic sunroom. "The roof
doesn't coincide with the floor plan . . . it's angled off. At the north
side of the room you look up toward the sky. It's as though I shaved off
the roof. I wanted to break up the box and spin you into the yard and the
sky." A slender triangular window inches above the floor features a view
of the couple's cactus garden. An upstairs window looking out from the
original structure's sun porch (now used by Bettyann as an office area)
allows her to play Juliet to Kevles' Romeo below.</TE>
<TE>   To keep the room from getting too much light, Giovannini's roof acts
as a tilted parasol, letting in soft northern light on one side while
shading it from the harsh southern exposure on the other. To integrate
the two structures, the designer copied the bungalow's asphalt shingles
on the new roof, while existing side shingles, salvaged from the former
addition, wrap around a corner of the new study. The addition's steel
frame, painted a deep gun-metal gray, complements the Craftsman's
original grayish-green exterior.</TE>
<TE>   Custom-designed steel-and-glass doors pivot open to the garden,
continuing the indoor/outdoor atmosphere. "I feel I'm always outside even
though I'm inside," says Kevles. "I'm close to nature and close to my
word processor at the same time."</TE>

<HD>Spring's Baby Garlic</HD>
<DH>When Harvested Before It Matures, It Brings a More Subtle Pungency
to Dishes</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMELIA SALTSMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Garlic's uses have long been praised--warding off everything from
unwanted suitors and vampires to the common cold. What garlic doesn't
call to mind is a specific season. It's always available; no Southern
California kitchen need ever be without it. Unlike tomatoes or peaches,
its yearly arrival isn't impatiently awaited. But, as Ecclesiastes says,
"To every thing there is a season," and garlic's season is spring.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning in early February and continuing through April, farmers
bring in great bunches of immature garlic that look a lot like skinny
leeks. Harvested halfway through the nine-month gestation (before the
familiar bulb or "head" forms), the entire plant is edible from its
developing clove to the tips of its sword-like leaves (garlic is
Anglo-Saxon for "spear plant").</LD>
<LD>   This green, or spring, garlic is a favorite ingredient in Asian
cooking, and can be sauteed or used in salads and soups. More vegetal
than pungent, more main ingredient than seasoning, it brings the fresh
sharpness of new grass to a dish, giving a more subtle and herbal flavor
than the familiar taste of mature garlic. The latter comes into its own
in summer, when it makes its way into such dishes as a piquant aioli,
served with crisp vegetables and fresh seafood for dipping, or is chopped
and tossed into a hot skillet, laying the foundation for many a dish.</LD>
<TE>   Riverside County organic farmers Dede and Jon Thogmartin, who
specialize in alliums--onions, leeks and garlic--grow green garlic as a
separate vegetable. "We plant it in its own bed," Dede explains. "We
don't just thin out a field of 'heading' garlic, which is probably how
the custom of pulling garlic young got started--to make room for the
maturing bulbs. We plant as soon as the ground cools in September/October
and begin harvesting in February."</TE>
<TE>   That's when I bring green garlic into my kitchen and pair it with
foods that showcase its delicacy and sprightly color: new potatoes for a
seasonal variation on vichyssoise, a subtle spaghetti aglio e olio,
spring risotto. Or I cook it slowly with pale-green cabbage until both
melt into sweet creaminess perfect with roasted salmon, young poultry or
baby lamb.</TE>
<TE>   As the season progresses at Southern California farmers' markets, the
young, slim garlic shoots become fat-bottomed bulbs. The erect leaves
have gone limp as the plant's energy concentrates on the developing
cloves. Soon it will be time for the farmers to pull the remaining garlic
plants from the earth and lay them in overlapping rows in the field to
cure into the papery, rock-hard orbs we know. That's when I know it soon
will be summer.</TE>
<TE>Melted Green Garlic and Cabbage</TE>
<TE>   Serves 6</TE>
<TE>   1 large head green cabbage, cored and cut into thin wedges to yield
about 8 cups</TE>
<TE>   3-4 bunches green garlic, about 3 cups chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 yellow onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   4 tablespoons unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   Kosher salt</TE>
<TE>   Black or white pepper, optional</TE>
<TE>   In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the cabbage for 3
minutes. Drain the cabbage, finely chop it and set aside. Clean and chop
the green garlic, including a couple of inches of the green leaves from
each plant. In a deep wide pot over medium-low heat, saute the onion and
garlic until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally
and being careful not to let the vegetables brown. Add the cabbage, 1-2
teaspoons salt and cook uncovered 5-10 minutes. Cover the pot, turn the
heat to low, and cook the vegetables slowly until they are reduced and
very creamy; this could take an hour or more. Lift the lid and stir
occasionally. If there is a lot of liquid in the pot, leave the lid off
for a while. If the mixture seems dry or in danger of sticking, add a bit
of water or chicken stock. Taste for seasoning and add more salt and
pepper, if desired. This may be made a day ahead and reheated on low
heat.</TE>

<HD>Following Celestino</HD>
<DH>Another Drago Brother Ventures Out, Offering an All Too Familiar
Menu</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a restaurateur takes over an existing establishment, few can
resist gutting the restaurant and starting over. It's not uncommon for $3
million to be spent on a make-over. And if that place fails, somebody
else will come along with a vision for turning the ill-fated site into a
golden goose.</LD>
<LD>   Celestino Drago's youngest brother, Giacomino, is shrewder than many.
When he decided to go off on his own, the younger Drago, who is chef at
his brother's pasta place, Il Pastaio in Beverly Hills, simply moved into
the short-lived Le Stelle on South Beverly Drive and opened for business.</LD>
<TE>   Aside from the new name, the only changes I can detect at Piccolo
Paradiso are the still photographs from the Italian film "Cinema
Paradiso" that now paper alcoves that once held bottles of wine. Other
than that, the simple, contemporary decor is the same. The Italian hosts
at the door are crisp and professional, quick to remember a face and a
name. The phone keeps ringing. The reservations keep arriving, filling
the tables with mostly regulars from Il Pastaio or Celestino Drago's
flagship restaurant, Drago in Santa Monica. Chef and owner Giacomino
Drago, resplendent in a snowy white chef's jacket and colorful
vegetable-print pants, also greets guests at the door. "Where have you
been? I haven't seen you at Il Pastaio in a while," he asks guests,
turning on the charm he shares with Celestino. It's a big part of the
Drago brothers' success. Where Celestino goes, three of his brothers have
followed, from Sicily to America, and the restaurant business.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's only a few blocks from Il Pastaio, Piccolo Paradiso (which
Giacomino owns with partners other than Celestino), offers the same style
of food and even some of the same dishes you'd find at any of Celestino
Drago's three restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Giacomino is out to make his name. Gift baskets filled with bottles of
olive oil and marinara sauce bearing his portrait in miniature sit by the
door. And when the waiter, always Italian, lists the specials, he'll also
mention that the chef will make a menu for the table, if you like. What
would it be? Giacomino's the artist, he answers, with a flourish. But the
waiter does give us a few hints. They're pretty much dishes on the menu.
We'll order a la carte, thank you.</TE>
<TE>   After 14 years in Los Angeles, the youngest Drago knows his clientele.
He has liberally sprinkled the menu with pretty salads, such as one of
baby spinach with beets and cubes of chalky goat cheese in a pleasant
balsamic vinaigrette. Or the antipasto called carpaccio di mele, which is
fine, transparent slices of whole apple topped with a chiffonade of
ruby-streaked radicchio, a little creamy Gorgonzola and a handful of
walnuts. This may be the best appetizer on the menu.</TE>
<TE>   The more traditional beef carpaccio is attractively scribbled with
mustard dressing and garnished with a fistful of greens and shaved
Parmigiano-Reggiano. And what's not to like about the burrata, that fresh
white cheese with a heart of cream, accompanied by a tart, refreshing
salad of true radicchio di Treviso and baby arugula?</TE>
<TE>   Some of the other antipasti, though, aren't as appealing. Every time
I've ordered the fried calamari, it has been limp and greasy. Melanzane
alla parmigiana, that usually enticing Southern Italian dish of eggplant
layered with tomato sauce and mozzarella, is heavy and also swimming in
oil. And the promising-sounding salad "Isolana," described as
Sicilian-style ratatouille, tastes as if it's been massaged with ketchup.
It hasn't, but that's the unappetizing effect.</TE>
<TE>   The surprise is how good the risotto is. Properly al dente, each grain
of rice bathed in broth, it comes in several versions. The one I like
best is made with Carnaroli rice from Piedmont, with local calamari and
sea urchin. The briny richness of the sea urchin roe plays up the
sweetness of the calamari and the plainness of the rice. Risotto with
slivers of smoked duck and spring asparagus tips is an excellent choice,
too, but risotto di Donna Carmela is ruined by low-quality porcini
mushrooms that dominate the dish.</TE>
<TE>   Tender little pillows of potato gnocchi are one of Italy's great
treats. Here, Drago has tried to be too fancy, stuffing his gnocchi with
mushrooms and napping them in a truffle "fondue." Minced black truffles
must have been invited to the party for their looks alone; their
nonexistent flavor has to be helped along with artificial-tasting white
truffle oil.</TE>
<TE>   As for pasta, it's safer to stick with the straightforward ones, such
as spaghetti di Antonio Natale, attributed to the chef's father. It's the
excellent Latini-brand pasta tossed with basil and cherry tomatoes, which
are sauteed to give up their juice. Because he's added some tomato sauce,
it's heavier than if just cooked with a little olive oil and the fresh
tomato, but still tasty. A rich, meaty ragout of quail and porcini goes
well with ribbons of inch-wide pappardelle. It's a great dish for a
Chianti riserva or a Barbera.</TE>
<TE>   Penne tinted green with basil are weighed down with fresh ricotta and
incredibly salty bottarga (the dried pressed tuna roe that's a specialty
of Sicily).Black spaghetti made with squid ink, which gives it a sweet
richness, would fare better without the unripe mangoes Drago has added to
the sauce of asparagus and shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   In my experience, none of the various Drago restaurants have made
procuring top-notch raw materials a priority. Bistecca fiorentina is
simply a thick piece of rib-eye charred rare. Basta. Unfortunately,
Piccolo Paradiso's bistecca is thin and gristly, and it tastes as if it's
been marinated in vinegar. Grilled quail could be any bird at all.
Roasted lamb loin is unidentifiable as lamb. What's good? The grilled
veal chop.</TE>
<TE>   Desserts aren't distinctive either, with the exception of the peach
bread pudding (hold the pistachio gelato, though) and the standard
tiramisu. Vanilla pudding in caramel sauce takes a page from that at Ca'
Brea and Il Moro.</TE>
<TE>   Giacomino Drago is serious about his restaurant. He's slaving in the
kitchen every night and making the obligatory rounds of the dining room,
too. Instead of following his brother Celestino's blueprint, I wish he'd
trust his instincts more and put more Italy than Beverly Hills into
Piccolo Paradiso. His restaurant is a pleasant neighborhood place with no
great culinary ambitions or distinction. Maybe that's enough. Like
Cheers, where everybody knows your name, Piccolo Paradiso targets the
comfort factor: familiar food, familiar faces.</TE>
