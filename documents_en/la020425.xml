<LD>Punk poet Henry Rollins stands facing the cameras, stone-faced and
covered in tattoos. To a thicket of reporters, Rollins offers a gem
of wisdom. "Where it comes from," he says, "is often cooler than
where it ends up."</LD>
<LD>   Rollins is talking about skateboarding, the subject of the Tuesday
night movie premiere. He is among the crowd of denim-, flannel- and
tattoo-clad surfers, skateboarders, actors and musicians who trekked
to a theater in the Pacific Design Center to see "Dogtown and
Z-Boys," director-writer Stacy Peralta's film on the birth of modern
skateboarding.</LD>
<LD>   The film features Rollins and several teenage boys (Z-Boys) who
reinvented the sport in Venice (Dogtown) during the 1970s. The movie,
which won acclaim and awards at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival,
opens in some cities Friday and nationally by mid-May.</LD>
<TE>   The push to get a seat on Tuesday night is frantic, even for Red
Hot Chili Peppers lead singer Anthony Kiedis, who arrived late. He
barks at the E! network folks trying to grab a sound bite. "I have to
get a seat!" he says when a reporter persists. "I know you don't care
about me or my seat!"</TE>
<TE>   Kiedis eventually lands one, but scores of others are stranded in
the lobby. To kill time, they sip martinis and watch Sean Penn's
young son Hopper launch himself off the velvet sofas. Penn stands
alone near a curtained wall, occasionally waving his son off the
furniture. Later, a woman walks to that wall and pulls away the
curtain to reveal hundreds of goody bags, stuffed with CDs, DVDs,
hair products and other merchandise. "It's a free-for-all now," says
one man to his companion. The entire crowd rushes the wall, nearly
trampling Penn and Hopper to grab two and three bags each.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, the theater empties and the room becomes a reunion
party. Skateboarding legend Tony Alva, wearing green sneakers and
dreadlocks, is locked in a bearhug by two other men. Former Z-Boy
Shogu Kobu, who now works in advertising, points out his former
skateboarding pals. They are aging men wearing T-shirts and jeans and
puckish attitudes. "I think Jay Adams is the only one who isn't
here," he says as a Curtis Mayfield record plays in the background.
"I think he got out of jail, but he couldn't leave Hawaii." Another
former Z-Boy, Chris Rumi, lines up at the bar. He traveled from Cape
Cod, Mass., to see the film. "This is the first time I've seen these
people in 20 years," he says. "It's a total blast."</TE>
<TE>   Shooting for a Star</TE>
<TE>   on the Walk of Fame</TE>
<TE>   "Dear Mr. Grant: I understand that some of Freddy Fender's
thousands of fans have proposed him for a star on the Hollywood Walk
of Fame. I heartily endorse his inclusion in this walk of stars." So
began a 1998 letter from then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush to Johnny
Grant, ceremonial mayor of Hollywood. Bush's pitch was
successful--Fender got his star.</TE>
<TE>   Grant has seen a lot of such letters, winners and losers. Each
year, he and his five-member committee review close to 300 requests
for the 15 to 20 stars that go to famous names each year, a process
that will begin again soon. May 31 is the deadline for this year's
submissions.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, publicists, labels or fan clubs nominate stars for the
walk, but people have been known to take matters into their own
hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to mention names," says Grant, quickly mentioning
two self-nominees: former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca and "Popcorn
King" Orville Redenbacher (who proposed himself as worthy of a star
before his bathtub-drowning death in 1995).</TE>
<TE>   Ozzy Osbourne, a recent addition to the walk, supported his
label's nomination with a letter stating that a star "would not only
be an important honor, but would fulfill my childhood dream."</TE>
<TE>   Although proper procedure dictates a written application, Grant
often gets pitches when he's out and about.</TE>
<TE>   "I was at funeral recently, and a [publicity] guy was hustling a
star--for the deceased and another client." And, just the other day,
Grant says, he was walking down the boulevard when a sumo wrestler
recognized the mayor and demanded a star. The wrestler wasn't a good
sport about rejection.</TE>
<TE>   "He got very upset," says Grant, with excitement in his voice. "I
got frightened and ran."</TE>
<TE>   Unless the sumo had a side career in movies, TV, radio, music or
live performance, he wouldn't be eligible for a spot. The only
requirement besides fame in those fields is that the honored
celebrities will be present at the dedication. Posthumous stars are
an exception, Grant adds. "They don't have to be there for that. We
let them skip it."</TE>
<TE>   Winning has a payoff, but also a price: Honorees must pay $15,000,
which covers the ceremony and the making of the star. Those selected
by Grant and his committee go to Los Angeles City Council for
approval. And the final vote, or veto, goes to the property owner on
the part of the walk where the star will be located. Sometimes,
owners will nix a star candidate and hold out for someone more
famous. "They always want a bigger name," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Grant's own name, it turns out, was big enough for two stars: one
in 1980 for his work in radio, and an honorary one in February, for
his work promoting Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "Some will play like they don't want it," Grant says, but "the
interesting thing is that years later, when their careers are fading,
they're desperate to get a star."</TE>

<LD>THE WOODEN NICKEL</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By William Carpenter</LD>
<TE>   Little, Brown</TE>
<TE>   346 pages, $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Third-generation Maine lobsterman Lucky Lunt cannot abide the
changes in the fishing world, nor those he finds in his own family.
At 46, Lucky's kids, Kyle and Kristen, are nearly grown and his wife,
Sarah, has taken up sea-glass sculpture, leaving her less time to
dote on her husband as she had for the last 21 years. Added to this,
Lucky suffers from a heart condition, and after recent surgery he
remains under strict orders to dramatically revamp his lifestyle.
With hospital bills threatening, the embattled lobsterman finds
himself in an unbearable bind.</TE>
<TE>   William Carpenter's descriptions of the fisherman's life off the
Atlantic Coast vividly bring the sea to life in his novel "The Wooden
Nickel," titled after its protagonist's lobster boat. Carpenter
successfully renders the rapidly vanishing world of small-time
lobstermen facing the loss of their manner of livelihood. But
Carpenter seems all sea legs when it comes to his depictions of the
relations between men and women. The tiresomely stereotypic dichotomy
between the mother and the seductress reigns over the novel, in which
Lucky's soon-to-be castoff wife, Sarah, fills the mother's role,
while the younger Ronnette does a smack-up job of playing the latter.</TE>
<TE>   The deck seems stacked against Sarah, whose "familiar papery skin"
seems to have grown untouchable. But 16 years younger than him,
Ronnette seems nothing short of the cat's meow, or at least the
lobsterman's bait to Lucky: "... Ronnette's got a face that makes her
look naked even with an overcoat on."</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter's failure to credibly imagine his female characters
works to erode readers' sympathies for his hulking, all-man hero,
because we never feel that his attachments go beyond the surface.
Sarah now has her own pursuits, and though she still wakes before
Lucky to lay out his clothes and fix his meals, her husband manages
nothing but disdain for her "art." Lucky stares and stares at Sarah's
mobiles, unable to fathom why anyone would spend time on them. But
Carpenter doesn't give us much insight into what Sarah feels or
thinks either. Rather, she seems a cardboard cutout of the
middle-aged wife. Her response to Lucky's infidelity seems scarily
reasoned and monotone, and not particularly believable given her
devotion to her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter humorously shows that Lucky has become a dinosaur,
unable to adapt to change. Yet we might feel more sympathetic if
Lucky made the least effort to reflect on his difficulties. Kyle
seems headed for no good, involved in fishing scams, flunking out of
high school, but all Lucky can do is meanly condemn the boy,
occasionally giving him a smack or two to set him straight. And after
his divorce, Lucky doesn't keep much contact with his kids, and, a
few months later, he sees a young woman on the street and begins his
usual obsessive appraisal of her looks, only to discover that he's
ogling his own daughter. When Kirsten invites him to meet her college
roommate, Lucky finds it difficult to focus on anything but the young
woman's cleavage.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky's fishing problems come across with drama and authenticity,
but his response to them seems so relentlessly reactive that readers
may lose patience with him here as well. When a whale raids his
traps, Lucky sets out to kill it, mindless of the disaster he is
bound to bring on. His boat's name suggests his fate, yet even this
ironic deflation doesn't quite redeem Carpenter's protagonist, or the
novel itself.</TE>

<HD>The Hot New Trend: Climate Control</HD>
<DH>Environment * As consumers become more concerned with
global warming, some companies talk up their products' 'green'
attributes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHERINE ELLISON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Ellie Rogers talks to customers in Ann Arbor, Mich., she often
dwells as much on the dangers of global warming as on the virtues of
her cosmetics and biodegradable kitchen cleaners.</LD>
<LD>   "It may seem like a stretch," allows Rogers. "But I'll ask if
they've noticed how hot it has been. And I'll ask if they're
concerned about that. And eventually, I'll tell them how more than
2,000 leading scientists around the world say it's a human
responsibility, that we're causing this weather change.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a pest about it," says Rogers, 73.</LD>
<TE>   Yet she's also convinced that, far from turning people away from
her sales pitch, her apocalyptic warnings warm them up to it.</TE>
<TE>   The marketing experts at her company, Shaklee Corp., agree.
"Global warming is an ice-breaker," sums up Ken Perkins, who
masterminds the approach at the firm's Pleasanton, Calif.,
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Perkins subscribes to an argument that's proving to be compelling
for an increasing number of other U.S. and European executives: Faced
with persistent news about melting ice caps, worsening storms and the
likelihood that future generations will broil, the average Joe is
much more anxious about the changing climate than his government may
suspect. He feels powerless, afraid--and guilty. Scientists tell him
he's spewing greenhouse gases by buying products manufactured by
burning oil, gas and coal, driving his car and even doing his
laundry. And he has no idea how to stop.</TE>
<TE>   But now, at least, Joe can vote with his wallet and buy a product
whose purveyors persuade him that at least they're doing something to
counteract the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   This reasoning "singles us out," says saleswoman Rogers, who says
it builds trust with customers to talk about her firm's good works,
including buying solar panels for homes in Sri Lanka. "It makes us
not like just another company, and that helps business."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental consciousness is nothing new to companies like
Shaklee, with its biodegradable products, and Ben &amp; Jerry's, the
Vermont ice cream firm that this month plans to launch a sweet new
concoction called "One Sweet Whirled" as part of a climate-change
awareness campaign.</TE>
<TE>   What's new is that linking salesmanship with actions to counter
global warming is gaining cachet among much larger, mainstream
companies. Sue Hall, who counsels businesses on climate strategies as
head of the Climate Neutral Network, a 2-year-old nonprofit based in
Lake Oswego, Ore., says she's making headway with a dozen Fortune 500
firms. Some executives involved in these discussions say they believe
that appeals based on the climate may strike a chord even as other
green marketing is on the wane.</TE>
<TE>   "Recycling is passe. Toxics are passe. But global warming is
different--it's the hottest issue, no pun intended," exudes an
executive at one of the firms, a multibillion-dollar paper company
planning to launch a product with a "save the climate" peg. (He asked
for anonymity pending the launch date.) Sparking that kind of
interest, says Hall, is a "sea change" in American society.</TE>
<TE>   "For so long, people have thought global climate change was just
too big to tackle," she explains. "They've been worried, yes, but
there was a kind of denial going on. It felt so remote in time, and
arcane and technical, and then, of course, you had the scientific
debate about it, which has only recently faded."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of global warming was long held suspect, the target of
political scorn and skepticism. In the last few years, however, as
the scientific consensus has solidified, articles linking droughts
and other weather calamities to climate change are appearing more
often in the mainstream press, and a grass-roots movement to fight
climate change has gained momentum, spurred by churches, college
campuses and scores of city governments.</TE>
<TE>   In that context, Hall and other environmentally oriented
consultants contend that associating one's company with action on
climate change reaps not only good karma but profits.</TE>
<TE>   "People are coming out of their denial and reaching for
solutions," Hall says. "But they see an absence of solutions at the
government level."</TE>
<TE>   The Climate Neutral Network aims to soothe that frustration by
channeling the energy elsewhere--into buying, that is. But only
buying products that are branded "Climate Cool."</TE>
<TE>   That trademark, bestowed to date on a line of carpeting from
Interface Inc., rooms at a Boston hotel, services from the Better
World Travel Agency, the entire operations of Shaklee Corp. and even,
most recently, the 2002 Winter Olympics, is awarded only after the
firms or event organizers jump through the following hoops.</TE>
<TE>   First, they measure their "footprint" of greenhouse gas
emissions--how much their operations produce a year. Then they reduce
those emissions as much as possible at the source. To compensate for
what remains--and get their net impact on the climate down to
zero--they pay to reduce greenhouse gases somewhere else. Those
projects, called "offsets," can score extra philanthropic public
relations points, with efforts such as Better World Travel's
investments in upgrading the heating equipment in Portland schools,
which saved money on the school's energy bills.</TE>
<TE>   In Great Britain, where climate-oriented marketing was born about
five years ago, Avis Rental Cars, Mazda U.K., the rock band Pink
Floyd and firms selling funeral plans have followed a similar
approach, marketing products and events paired with contributions to
counter climate change. The cause, says John Shopley, CEO of Future
Forests, the for-profit group that manages most of these clients, has
been taken up by 125 corporations and 12,000 individuals who have
paid to "cancel" the greenhouse gas emissions from activities
including weddings and bar mitzvahs.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Olson, a Climate Neutral Network consultant, tells corporate
chiefs that branding themselves as climate-conscious is a great way
to rise above the herd and attract customers whose concerns about
environmental issues are growing. In particular, he cites research on
consumers whose preferences place them in a group known as Lifestyles
of Health and Sustainability, representing about 63 million adults. A
recent Harris Interactive survey found nearly 82% of these
environmentally minded consumers say they would pay up to 20% more
for healthy and sustainable products.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea behind green marketing is that someone may not
have time to be an activist but at least can express their values in
how they buy things," Olson says.</TE>
<TE>   The notion of consuming for the sake of the environment can make
for strange bedfellows. Hall and Olson report that two major airlines
and a large oil company are intrigued by the idea of a Climate Cool
purchasing card. Yet the notion of "green gas" is the kind of extreme
that makes many environmentalists nervous.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good idea lots of people are abusing," says Carl Pope,
executive director of the Sierra Club. "There's a lot of hype out
there." With the Winter Olympics, for example, Pope said, the Sierra
Club had lobbied organizers to encourage mass transit. Instead, he
said, the state of Utah built new freeways to cope with the event.
"Where's the 'climate neutral' in that?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, it's clearly absurd to say the more climate-cool gas you're
burning, the more good you're doing, but that's not our message,"
responds Olson, the Climate Neutral Network business strategy expert.
The more important signal, he maintains, is that pollution has a
price, which should somehow be made part of our economic reckoning.
And the companies that agree voluntarily to pay it, by conscientious
investments, will win consumers' hearts.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Ann Arbor, Ellie Rogers has a more straightforward agenda.
Personally, though she's a top distributor for her company, she's
just as interested in winning converts to her climate-change cause as
in using climate arguments to sell products.</TE>
<TE>   "You've heard how a butterfly flapping its wings in one place can
cause a hurricane somewhere else?" she asks. "Well, Shaklee has
500,000 distributors. If each of them tells five who tell five who
tell five, pretty soon you've got a movement."</TE>

<LD>Nature's Water Treatment Plants</LD>
<LD>   Did you know that wetlands are vital to the health of our
environment and our water supply? One of the functions healthy
wetlands perform is to clean urban runoff--the surface water that
comes from rainstorms and drainage. As the urban runoff washes
through our cities, it collects pollutants such as oil, pesticides,
household chemicals and animal waste. In Los Angeles, the Ballona
Wetlands help prevent polluted runoff from traveling directly into
the Pacific Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   How does that work? Wetland soils and plants act as barriers and
filters that capture and hold pollutants. Some microorganisms within
wetlands actually break down toxins. Plants also soak up pollutants,
and then release them to be absorbed by other plants or stored in
soil. Try the following activity to see how a plant absorbs
pollution.</LD>
<TE>   Materials: plastic cup; water; celery stalk; red or blue food
coloring.</TE>
<TE>   Step 1: Fill half of the plastic cup with water. This represents
urban runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Add several drops of food coloring to the water. This is
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Place the stalk of celery in the "polluted" water. Imagine
the "polluted" water is flowing through wetlands and the celery
represents many different kinds of plants.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Allow the celery to sit in the "polluted" water overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: The next day, observe the celery stalk and note any
changes.</TE>
<TE>   Step 6: Take the celery stalk out of the cup and look at the area
where the stalk was cut.</TE>
<TE>   Do you see colored dots on the surface? These are channels that
carry water and the "pollution" through the plant. This is similar to
how pollutants are absorbed by wetland plants. But plants can't do
all the work! Many toxic materials still make their way to oceans,
rivers and lakes. Wetlands are nature's way of dealing with the
problem. But nature needs our help. Greater efforts must be made to
stop pollutants from initially getting into our water. Interested in
learning more? Call the Ballona Wetlands Foundation to arrange a
visit to your school from the WOW Team (Wonders of Wetlands). For
more details, call Abby Fox at (310) 574-0700.</TE>

<HD>On the Sunny Side of the Mall</HD>
<DH>Pedestrian-friendly centers make the L.A. pastime a
worthwhile exercise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Pedestrian shopping experience" is apparently the new term for
malls. It's always nice to see capitalists making hay while the
post-ironic sun shines, and it's as good a term as any, if you don't
mind having a word that once meant a sensual, emotional
occurrence--that would be "experience," not "shopping"--dragooned
into the ever-swelling ranks of synonyms for "stores."</LD>
<LD>   But time spent at the newest local "experiences"--Hollywood &amp;
Highland in Hollywood, the Grove in the Fairfax district and Paseo
Colorado in Pasadena--leaves one longing for a well-placed hyphen. As
in "pedestrian-shopping experiences." As in shopping for pedestrians.</LD>
<LD>   For all its drive-by reputation, Los Angeles has become a runway
of pedestrians. These three are but the newest links in a bracelet of
similar marketplaces strung across Southern California. Somewhere
between the creation of the Century City Mall and the refurbs of
Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica and Pasadena's Old Town, urban
planners and merchants realized that people like to see the sky as
they duck in and out of doorways, that they prefer the breezy noise
of the open street to the trapped cacophony of the average indoor
mall.</LD>
<TE>   Many argue that a true street scene can never emerge from some
prefab Main-Street-in-a-Box. And it's true that within the frescoed
and fountained faux-ness of the three new marketplaces many of the
stores are redundant (does every Angeleno have his or her own
personal Banana Republic yet?)</TE>
<TE>   But the people milling about within them are not.</TE>
<TE>   From the backpack-and-camera-strung tourists of Hollywood
Boulevard to the cell-phone addicted locals in the Fairfax district
to the Pasadena moms in their khaki capri pants and white canvas
tennis shoes, the crowds could not embody the neighborhoods better if
Central Casting had been involved.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood &amp; Highland</TE>
<TE>   In the courtyard of Hollywood &amp; Highland on a Monday, at least
seven languages are being spoken, including French, German, Japanese
and Russian--and that's just from the folks perusing the kiosk
stacked with sunglasses. High above, white marble elephants rage, but
the frescoes of jackals and pharaohs frame less-than-exotic
stores--an Ann Taylor, a Nestle Tollhouse cookie shop.</TE>
<TE>   Unidentifiable disco and a small white sun beat down on the pale
cement, coating everything with a glittery silver haze. It is not an
inviting light, and this may explain why so many of the folks are
simply circling the courtyard, rather than sitting at one of the
mosaic-topped tables to take their rest. Or it could simply be that
most of these people are tourists and it is too early in the day for
tourists to sit down.</TE>
<TE>   People who are on vacation often need to buy things. Not just
touristy things like T-shirts and snow globes, but high-end items
like gold jewelry and expensive handbags. This is the main reason
Hollywood &amp; Highland exists.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, all tourist roads lead to the Grauman's Chinese
Theatre where people from Rhode Island and the Ukraine take similar
comfort from the size of John Wayne's feet and Trigger's hooves.</TE>
<TE>   For years, residents have watched the inevitable disappointment
bloom on the faces of visitors as they realize that not only is there
no Hollywood in the real Hollywood, there's not even a decent place
to shop.</TE>
<TE>   So now Ralph Lauren and Louis Vuitton lurk beside the stores that
sell Marilyn posters. Wandering past them, and occasionally through
them, are barelegged and relentlessly blond German families,
multi-generational clusters of Asian women, a conga line of
Australian teens and a French couple with two toddlers.</TE>
<TE>   In the first hours after the stores' 10 a.m. opening, there are
more security guards than shoppers. But by noon, people have tired of
looking at stars in the sidewalk and of trying to picture the red
carpet on the concrete outside the Kodak Theatre, and the mall
becomes a floor show of vacation wear--fanny packs and shirts that
wick, hybrids of Teva sandals and lots of expensive video equipment.
Cameras outnumber shopping bags by about 3 to 1, which is not a good
sign for the mall.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot see what stores there are," said a woman with a Down
Under accent, peering out of the shade in the white light of the
courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   "And so many stairs," said her mother, pausing to take a picture.</TE>
<TE>   Reports are that business is not as good as planners had hoped at
Hollywood &amp; Highland, and on this day that is not surprising. Even
when locals beef up the lunchtime crowds, there are simply not that
many people here. In the tunnels that spin off the courtyard, there
is not much to do after one has admired what may be the nicest Burger
King in town. And everyone looks slightly lost in the dim light. But
lost to a disco beat, and that may, along with the elephants, the
Oscar walk and the sheer size of this thing, live up to someone's
idea of L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The Grove</TE>
<TE>   Less than five miles away, the Grove's blue-sky version of the
city could not be more different. For one thing, it's inexplicably 10
degrees cooler, as if the merchants, in their zeal to create a
Midwestern ambience, had April breezes from Missouri piped in.</TE>
<TE>   The dearth of bare legs makes it clear that this is a native
assembly--while visitors from icier climes may find spring in Los
Angeles shorts weather, Angelenos do not. 68 degrees? Brrrr.</TE>
<TE>   On the swath of grass at the center of "towne," a crowd has
gathered to watch a French puppeteer--toddlers in Gap hats and Peg
Perego strollers, boys in white shirts and yarmulkes who laugh and
shove their dark-eyed sisters, and women so lean in their Lycra tops
that a biological relationship to the infants in their arms seems a
biological impossibility.</TE>
<TE>   For all the kvetching--about the impact on the Farmers Market, the
traffic on Third, the ugliness of the Grove from the street--the
place is packed. Certainly, there are tourists here, whistling by in
their matching windbreakers on their way to or from the buses that
surface like whales in the various parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   But for the most part the crowd that moves past the stores--Kids
Pottery Barn, Sur La Table, Banana Republic and the incredible tiara
collection at a cart called Juliette's--is L.A. at its most filmable:
long-legged, midriff-baring girls; well-shod TV executives on their
lunch hour; Orthodox Jewish men in blue suits and fedoras;
hand-holding 20-something couples of every ethnic background and
gender pairing; mothers and fathers armored in Baby Bjorns and
trailing toddlers like ducklings. Cell phones are everywhere but
there's not a camera in sight.</TE>
<TE>   If this commercial storm has an eye, it is the FAO Schwarz. The
revolving door, the stuffed animals the size of VW Bugs and a
floor-sized piano keyboard right out of the movie "Big" evoke life
before the measureless caverns of Toys R Us.</TE>
<TE>   Here shoppers can contemplate the meaning of Judy Garland dolls
(the highball glasses and barbiturates are, one assumes, optional
accessories) and other mysteries of life.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry, honey," said a woman to one of the two teens with her,
"the Easter Bunny does not bring cell phones to 13-year-olds."</TE>
<TE>   "Aren't there any regular Legos anymore?" one man asked his
companion as they trawled the shelves. "Are they all tied to movies
now? I remember regular Legos, and I'm not that old, am I?"</TE>
<TE>   "Her situation is very similar to mine," said a woman into her
cell phone as her daughter tried on feather boas. "Her ex-husband
also lives in Paris, and it's been very difficult with all the
security ... "</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't find anything in his zone," said a father to a mother
over the head of their son. "What about this?" the mother asked,
holding up a Harry Potter game. The father shook his head. "Harry
Potter is not in his zone."</TE>
<TE>   For a novelist or screenwriter in search of inspiration, there
really is no reason to go anywhere else but FAO Schwarz at the Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Paseo Colorado</TE>
<TE>   At Paseo Colorado, women rule. All sorts of women. Streaky blond
moms in flat-fronted khakis and untucked white button-down shirts,
women in long flowered skirts and black blazers striding toward lunch
with their male colleagues, pairs of older women with matching pixie
haircuts, and younger women in black leather coats and square-heeled
boots that clomp like Speed Racers.</TE>
<TE>   It is a feminine mall, more at one with its environment than
others we could name. The rosy sandstone of the steps, and tiles and
planters echo similar accents on nearby landmarks--the Civic
Auditorium, City Hall, the post office.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there's an Ann Taylor here, a Macy's and the newly ubiquitous
Tommy Panama, but there's not a Gap or Banana Republic in sight.
Instead, there is an unusual mix of specialty stores--Harry and
David, J.Jill, the Yankee Candle Co., Jacardi and Japanese Weekend,
one of the nicest and priciest maternity stores around.</TE>
<TE>   It is quieter here than at the Grove or Hollywood &amp; Highland;
there are fountains but not noisy fountains. There is music, but it
is soft, New Agey, barely discernable. No one yells, not even the
small children.</TE>
<TE>   On a Monday afternoon, people are buying things, but slowly and
not in great quantity. There is a Gelson's, which does good business,
and an apartment complex attached--people live at this mall, which
helps explain some of the people walking and sitting, and talking and
strolling.</TE>
<TE>   It's not hard to imagine the types of folks who would live above a
high-endish mall. Moms and grandmoms who would not find it unusual to
spend $95 on a wool dress in size 3T, older men barefoot inside their
Topsiders in search of the perfect Hawaiian print, folks who would
pay retail for the latest Coach bag, who, on their way to a facial at
the Amadeus Spa could walk past a sign offering "12 wax potpourri
tarts for $9.99" as if a wax potpourri tart were the most normal
thing in the world.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, the things that are for sale here are not that
much different from the things for sale at the Grove or Hollywood &amp;
Highland, or any other mall, for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   But the lure of the marketplace has never been just the market.</TE>
<TE>   As much as they need to buy things, people need to brush past
strangers, eavesdrop on conversations, take a look at their
neighbors. People need to hold hands and kiss their lovers right in
front of everyone, to walk in a crowd that is neither waiting nor in
a hurry, to eat in the sunshine and watch people walk by, to feel
part of something bigger and more bustling than their own thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   A year from now, two years from now, the sales figures will tell
how successful these new pedestrian shopping experiences are as
venues.</TE>
<TE>   But as public spaces, they're working pretty well right now
because it's almost always the people rather than the things that
make space interesting.</TE>

<HD>In a Family Way</HD>
<DH>Designers and celebrities eschew the Hollywood glitz in
favor of elegance and comfort in a showcase house benefiting a kids'
charity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may be called Celebrity Showhouse, but the accent here is less on
Hollywood glitz and more on restrained elegance for a home for a
family with two kids. It's appropriate in this case, given that the
benefiting charity is the Children's Action Network, which deals with
children's issues.</LD>
<LD>   "Our theme is a home for a real family," says creative director
Elizabeth Blair of House Beautiful magazine, the benefit's sponsor.
"We didn't want a house with five elaborate living rooms."</LD>
<LD>   Opening to the public on Monday for a month, a 6,500-square-foot
English country house in Brentwood features rooms by 22 designers,
some of whom collaborated with celebrities, using them as theoretical
clients for the project.</LD>
<TE>   The basic color palette throughout is soothing: soft greens, muted
blues, violets, creams with an occasional burst of red, black and
gold as accents in paintings, carpeting and flooring. The same holds
true for the exterior, with white and blue flowers, expansive lawns
and a new swimming pool by Godfredsen &amp; Sigal Architects made of blue
and green Bisazza Italian glass mosaic tiles.</TE>
<TE>   The living room, designed by Waldo Fernandez with input from
actress Anjelica Huston, sets a calm tone. Done in soft beiges, the
room's decor mixes a sofa designed by Fernandez, Art Deco antiques
and a Jean-Michel Frank library table with art, including a plaque by
Robert Graham, acid-treated photos by Robert Stivers and a red
abstract painting by Lee Mullican.</TE>
<TE>   Designer Barbara Barry's dining area for Oscar winner Halle Berry
is serene, using light green, white and lavender. Barry designed the
wall-covering fabric as well as the chairs and a dark wooden serving
table.</TE>
<TE>   New York designer Christopher Coleman's lounge for Sylvester
Stallone and Jennifer Flavin updates a 1950s look in blue and green
that coordinates with the nearby swimming pool. The furniture doubles
as exercise benches, and there is a cactus-green wall cabinet with
vintage blue handles, upholstered leather walls and a
state-of-the-art cooling drawer. "We have a lot of items here that
aren't on the market yet," Blair says.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 1,000 square feet were added to the existing house for the
project. The kitchen, by Peter Dunham and Tim Barber, was extended to
make room for a raised fireplace and extra storage room. The
refrigerator and freezer are hidden behind blackboard and corkboard
doors. The ceiling was raised to 12 feet to give the room an airy
feeling, and French doors were added for light. The handmade floor
with patterned tile squares in tomato red, black and gold was
designed by Denis Colomb.</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne Rheinstein and Joe Nye enlarged the downstairs family room
by adding a long family porch that overlooks a garden, which was once
an asphalt driveway. In the room, one wall is replete with old prints
of Paris; another has a television in an antique French armoire.
Antique tables in various sizes and motifs, including East Indian and
Chinese, create interest throughout the room.</TE>
<TE>   Two rooms upstairs fling off the subdued color palette found
elsewhere. Thomas Beeton's family room for Julia Louis-Dreyfus has a
blast of electric green on the walls, raisin- and rose-colored sofas
and, cleverly, brightly colored pieces of children's art put together
collage-like in one large frame. "I like to combine fine art with
children's art in family rooms like this," says Los Angeles-based
Beeton.</TE>
<TE>   Designer Antonia Hutt created a dream room for a teenage boy.
There's a large-screen video-game projector with a ceiling-mounted
camera (the camera alone cost $12,000), a slim computer on a
high-tech desk, a black Marc Newsome chair, long black plastic flaps
for a closet door and red Pirelli rubber flooring. Taking the red and
black that other designers used in moderation and making them her
main colors, Hutt created a room that boys--if not their
parents--would love.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, in the boy's bathroom, by Molly Luetkemeyer, a custom
photo mural of a surfer riding a wave hangs on the ceiling. It is
created from a photo that was turned into wallpaper. The creative
possibilities for this, from Totally Custom Wallpaper of Atlanta, are
endless.</TE>
<TE>   This show house mirrors the current desire to spend more time at
home with family and friends. Children's art is mixed with fine art;
books appear as well as flat-screen televisions; sofas and chairs
look capable of being flopped into, and although fabric-covered walls
aren't inexpensive, less expensive re-creations could be done with
similarly colored paint. The design is in the details--the white
floral painting on the master bedroom's walls, the hand-painted silk
in off-white and silver tones in the small home office, the sea-grass
runner up the stairs. All in all, this is that rare bird, a showcase
house that is restrained and in good taste.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets to the House Beautiful Celebrity Showhouse are $25 each
and must be purchased at the door. The house is at 130 N. Bristol
Ave. and is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily except on Thursdays,
when it is open until 8 p.m. Through May 27. For information, call
toll free: (866) 255-9069.</TE>

<LD>"A bud on earth, a flower in heaven."</LD>
<LD>   --Inscription on an 1872</LD>
<LD>   headstone in Old City Cemetery</LD>
<TE>   SACRAMENTO--Laid out in 1850 on a sandy hill just outside of town,
the Old City Cemetery is the final resting place for some of
California's Gold Rush luminaries, such as John Sutter Jr., E.B.
Crocker and Mark Hopkins, as well as three governors and roughly
25,000 other early residents. The cemetery recently has become a
final resting place of sorts for many equally illustrious old roses.
The Historic Rose Garden here is home to almost 200 heritage roses
gathered from other old cemeteries and similar historic sites in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Roses have long been associated with cemeteries. Chiseled rose
blossoms frequently decorate old headstones. Rosebuds with broken
stems were used on children's markers to signify a life "nipped in
the bud." Rosebushes were often planted on graves in loving memory of
mothers, grandmothers and other deceased family members. Many of
these old roses have survived the ages because they are tough and
drought-resistant, unlike their modern descendants.</TE>
<TE>   Most are big, mounding shrubs or climbers, classed in the rose
world as Chinas, Teas, Noisettes, Ramblers, Polyanthas and the like.
At Old City, they have been planted in abandoned family plots, where
they grow next to marble tombstones, crypts and monuments. The
weathered, lichen-covered stone makes an incredibly dramatic backdrop
for these blowzy antique blooms.</TE>
<TE>   There is perhaps no better place in the state to see old roses
because they are not crowded together as they are in botanic garden
collections. Instead the roses have room to grow to their natural
size, to spread their wings, so to speak. At the Historic Rose
Garden, the old shrub roses can become huge, billowy
mounds--flowering haystacks--breathtaking when in bloom. Long sprays
of blossoms arch over the monuments and perfume the air in spring and
summer, though they peak right about now.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike modern cemeteries, the plots in Old City have always been
privately owned and maintained. Only the narrow paths are cared for
by the city. Each plot is typically surrounded by a foot-tall brick
or stone wall, occasionally by an ornate iron fence. In Victorian
times, the cemetery looked like a community garden, with the
20-by-20-foot parcels lavishly planted and tended. It's been said
that the various families competed with each other to see who would
have the prettiest plot. So much gardening was going on at that time
that a nursery sprung up across the street to supply lawn seed, roses
and the weeping "mourning cypress" planted in many of the plots.</TE>
<TE>   But by the mid-1900s, most of the family plots had been abandoned
and the old cemetery was no longer being maintained. Plots were
vandalized and the beautifully carved tombstones toppled and broken.
In 1986, Dr. Bob LaPerriere, a retired dermatologist, concerned over
the degradation of this historic landmark, organized the Old City
Cemetery Committee to protect and preserve the stones and monuments.
With help from the local sheriff's community service Work Project
Program, the grounds were again maintained, at least minimally.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Fred Boutin, a former botanist with the Huntington
Library and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, was in town giving a
talk on old roses when someone took him to see the few surviving
heirlooms at Old City. After walking around the 28-acre site, he said
he thought, "What a perfect place to preserve old roses," though at
the time the grounds were pretty barren. "It was basically weeds and
dirt," he recalled--the city was naturally reluctant to do any work
inside the privately owned plots, even though most were abandoned
long ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Historic Rose Garden was created, and volunteer gardeners were
encouraged to adopt a plot and plant it, knowing that should the
family reclaim the plot for a burial, the plants would have to be
removed. Barbara Oliva, the rose garden's coordinator, said that
about 120 volunteers work in the garden each year. Native plant
enthusiasts, a perennial plant club and an iris group have also taken
over sections of the cemetery, so it is again looking like a colorful
community garden, filled with flowers and activity.</TE>
<TE>   LaPerriere and the Old City committee have started the California
Historic Cemetery Alliance (www.califhistcemeteries.org) in an effort
to preserve other old cemeteries. Many old California cemeteries have
heirloom roses hiding in them, and almost 200 of these pre-1900
plants have been collected and planted at Old City. "It's a good
cross-section of what survives at old cemeteries," said Boutin.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the survivors, "almost 25%," he said, are so old and
obscure that they cannot be identified, let alone named. In those
cases, they are given working designations like "No. 42," "12th
Avenue Smoothie" or "Half Moon Bay Yellow." But the preservationists
were able to identify 100 or more of their finds and even discover
many of their old names in period catalogs and references.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony P. Smith, one of the state's pioneer nurserymen, published
the state's first catalog of roses in 1857, and it has been
invaluable, listing an amazing 135 varieties. Smith happens to be one
of the luminaries who was buried at Old City, in 1877. The garden now
has many of the old varieties mentioned in that early catalog.</TE>
<TE>   The first of the new plantings were made near the top of one hill
in 1992 and included several important and classic old roses found in
California, including the red "Ragged Robin," which is actually an
1825 rose named 'Gloire des Rosomanes,' or "Glory of the Rose
Maniacs," as Boutin said it's sometimes called. Found at the Angel's
Camp cemetery, it's a hybrid China rose, and the parent of
essentially all modern red roses.</TE>
<TE>   Boutin pointed out that only certain kinds of roses are survivors.
What are classed as Chinas and Teas are the most common at cemeteries
because they are the most drought-tolerant (but don't confuse old
Teas with modern Hybrid Teas, which need water and wouldn't last a
week in an old cemetery).</TE>
<TE>   Growing near Ragged Robin is a powerfully fragrant rose--the "most
fragrant," according to Boutin. It was found years ago beside an old
adobe in Glendora. Lots of rose people, and old rose catalogs, call
it the "Portland rose from Glendora," but Boutin is pretty sure it's
named 'Joasine Hanet.'</TE>
<TE>   Along another path, 'Fortune's Double Yellow,' a rose found
growing on a garden wall in China in 1845, frames nearby headstones
with rich apricot-yellow blooms. Boutin said that this rose was once
common bordering orange groves in Southern California. Not too far
away is the pink 'La Reine Victoria,' the sumptuous old 1872 Bourbon
that first got Boutin and many others interested in old roses.</TE>
<TE>   Three 'Gloire Lyonnaise' grow several plots away, exploding over a
tall, marble stela, one of those obelisk-like marble monuments, the
arching canes covered with big, blowzy, white blooms. This glorious
rose was introduced in France in 1884. Nearby is an equally luscious
1887 Tea named 'Elie Beauvillain,' which becomes a frothy pink mound
that looks remarkably like cotton candy. "It's really colored like
candy, don't you think?" asked Boutin.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, what I was thinking is that I didn't want to wait until
I resided in an old cemetery to grow either of these lovely old
roses.</TE>

<LD>Maria and her younger brother Alfonso are on a hike in the desert
with their Uncle Ruben, who is a nature guide. During the hike, Uncle
Ruben picked up a 1-inch thick flat rock measuring about 10 inches by
seven inches.</LD>
<LD>   "Let's use this to cook," he told Alfonso and Maria.</LD>
<LD>   They looked at each other and laughed.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a pan at home," Maria giggled.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the campsite, Uncle Ruben first washed his flat rock. He
then propped it up on some bricks in the fire pit. While the fire was
warming the rock, he put some oil on it. While Alfonso and Maria
stared in amazement, Uncle Ruben cracked three eggs onto the flat
rock. They sizzled.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought you were kidding," Maria said.</TE>
<TE>   The eggs cooked slowly and evenly and didn't burn. Uncle Ruben
took a flipper and removed each one from the rock, giving one to each
child.</TE>
<TE>   "It tastes as good as a regular egg," Alfonso said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it is good," Maria said.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben explained that rocks like these were the frying pans
of the old days, before everyone had stainless steel and cast-iron
skillets. He explained that Native American families would select a
piece of sandstone and carefully shape it, sometimes taking as much
as a week to make a good family cook stone.</TE>
<TE>   "The Native Americans of the past didn't have plastic dishes and
stainless-steel pots and pans," Uncle Ruben said, "so meals were
eaten on dishes made from bark, and foods were cooked right in the
fire or on flat rocks like this. If you live close to nature, you
learn nature's secrets and you learn how nature can provide for all
your needs."</TE>
<TE>   "Cool," Maria said.</TE>

<LD>   'The Rookie' Makes Its White House Debut</LD>
<LD>   When Mark Johnson, a producer of "The Rookie," sat for interviews
prior to the movie's March 29 release, he encountered a recurring
refrain: "This is one movie that the president should see," a number
of people suggested.</LD>
<TE>   The $22-million, G-rated film is based on the real-life story of
former pitcher Jim Morris who, at 35, got his first shot at the major
leagues. President Bush was once an owner of the Texas Rangers and
has a pervasive love of the game.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, the White House presentation finally came to
pass. Disney chief Michael Eisner and Motion Picture Group Chairman
Dick Cook showed up, as did the actor who plays Morris, Dennis Quaid,
accompanied by his son Jack.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of "The Rookie's" creative team toured the mansion
and had drinks with the president and first lady before sitting down
with them and other Washington officials for the screening. There was
sustained applause at the end of the film, after which everyone sat
down to a Tex-Mex meal of enchiladas and avocado salad.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little nervous going in--not only about things like the
film being focused but about whether we'd captured everything
accurately," director John Lee Hancock said afterward. "The president
is intimately familiar with the subject matter, so there was a lot to
lose.</TE>
<TE>   "With the weight of the world on his shoulders," he continued,
"Bush could be excused for dozing off. But I watched him out of the
corner of my eye and he was totally with it."</TE>
<TE>   And how did the down-home president handle Hollywood
glitterati--many of them died-in-the-wool Democrats?</TE>
<TE>   "Totally gracious," Hancock replied. "He seems like a guy who's
really well acquainted with himself."</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Vieira the Front-Runner to Host 'Millionaire'</TE>
<TE>   Meredith Vieira, a panelist on ABC's daytime show "The View," is
expected to serve as host of the syndicated weekday version of "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire," premiering in September.</TE>
<TE>   Stations that have agreed to carry the show have grown
increasingly antsy about the lack of a host. Buena Vista Television,
the Disney subsidiary distributing the show, declined to comment, but
reports indicate that Vieira will take on the quiz-show assignment as
well as extend her agreement with "The View."</TE>
<TE>   The arrangement comes at a time when other networks have been
pursuing Vieira. CBS, for instance, has been interested in adding her
to its struggling morning program "The Early Show."</TE>
<TE>   TV Land to Enter Award Show Arena</TE>
<TE>   MTV's Movie Awards, scheduled for their next go-round in June,
have already become a staple of the film awards circuit. Now, sister
network TV Land is adding to the award logjam with plans to
inaugurate a TV Land Classic TV Awards ceremony next spring.</TE>
<TE>   The event will honor both contemporary and classic shows, with
specific categories still being worked out.</TE>
<TE>   In other scheduling news, TV Land said Wednesday that, in
November, it will begin airing "TV Land Legends: The 60 Minutes
Interviews," drawing on 30 years of interviews with TV personalities
conducted by the newsmagazine. TV Land and CBS are owned by Viacom.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ashanti, the 21-year-old R&amp;B singer from New York, tops the national
album sales chart for the third consecutive week, this time fighting
off a strong challenge from Sheryl Crow.</LD>
<LD>   Crow's first album in four years, "C'mon, C'Mon," sold nearly
185,000 copies in its first week in stores, which fell about 5,000
copies short of matching Ashanti's total last week. The latter's
self-titled album has sold 941,000 copies in three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Josh Groban's self-titled album continues its dramatic
climb on the chart. Groban is a 20-year-old Los Angeles singer who
sings in a polished pop style more common in the pre-rock era than in
today's market, which is dominated by rock and hip-hop.</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to a series of high-profile TV appearances by Groban, the
album entered the charts in late December and climbed to No. 41
before starting a descent that took it to No. 121 two weeks ago.
After Groban was profiled on the television program "20/20" on April
12, the album soared to No. 12, and it jumped again to No. 8 this
week.</TE>
<TE>   Some other high-profile albums, meanwhile, are taking sharp drops
on the chart. The Goo Goo Dolls' "Gutterflowers" drops from No. 4 to
No. 11 in its second week in stores. Neil Young's "Are You
Passionate?" falls from No. 10 to No. 33 in its second week.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Ashanti, Crow and Groban in the Top 10 are, in order,
Celine Dion, Vol. 9 of the "Now That's What I Call Music"
compilation, "The Scorpion King" soundtrack, Tweet, the "O Brother,
Where Art Thou?" soundtrack, Pink and Shakira.</TE>
<TE>   The bestselling single remains 'N Sync's pairing with Nelly on
"Girlfriend."</TE>
<TE>   Sound Advice</TE>
<TE>   (From The Times' album reviews)</TE>
<TE>   Badly Drawn Boy's "Just a Boy," ARTIST/direct Records/XL
Recordings. This soundtrack for the film "Just a Boy" recaptures the
understated charm and gentle insights of this British
singer-songwriter's much acclaimed debut album--and then some.</TE>
<TE>   Elvis Costello's "When I Was Cruel," Island/Def Jam. Costello gets
back to basics with a collection whose highlights are a proper
throwback to the songwriter's late-'70s literate punk-new wave roots.</TE>
<TE>   Cee-Lo's "Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections," Arista. In
the album, Cee-Lo reaches out to rap fans, funk followers and rock
aficionados in consecutive cuts, showing the hip-hop star's striking
artistic range.</TE>
<TE>   Cabas' "Cabas," EMI Latin. The newest rage in his native Colombia,
Cabas is edgier than Carlos Vives, more folkloric than Juanes and
more socially insightful than Shakira. The album carries you along
like a jungle river, startling at one turn, enchanting at the next.</TE>

<LD>   "Zero to Infinity: Arte Povera, 1962-1972,'' a much-anticipated
comprehensive historical survey opening at MOCA's Geffen Contemporary
on Sunday, focuses on Italian sculpture from the late 1960s and '70s
that embraced humble materials, found objects and the commonplace. In
using traditional and mundane materials--wax, mirrors, lead,
newspaper, neon, fabric--the artists created an art form that
concerned itself with real life.</LD>

<TE>   Pianist Cyrus Chestnut graduated from Berklee with a degree in
jazz composition and arranging. Early in his career, he worked with
Betty Carter, Terence Blanchard and others. While he mixes styles and

<TE>   Some movies make better Broadway musicals than others. "Saturday

with music and lyrics by pop composer David Yazbek and book by
Terrence McNally, is based on the 1997 film about six unlikely male
strippers. It's still running on Broadway and in the West End, but
the start of this national tour is sort of a Southern California
homecoming: It got its start at the Globe Theatres in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "The Full Monty," Ahmanson Theatre, 135 N. Grand Ave., L.A., 8
p.m. Regular schedule: Tuesdays to Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 2 and

<HD>A Few Tips to Keep the Weekend Festive (Hint: No
Backpacks)</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The size and scope of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival
make it a smorgasbord for music fans, but also a test of stamina.
Below are some tips for surviving the Coachella weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Step smartly: Needless to say, comfortable shoes are vital for
navigating the 80 acres and five stages, but you also need a careful
eye. After nightfall, the expanses between the stages become dim
minefields of litter and fans sacked out on the grass. Organizers are
stepping up the litter patrols this year to help save ankles, and
they also ask fans to use the garbage cans and squish plastic bottles
to maximize trash capacity.</LD>
<LD>   Shed your backpack: Yes, that's right, backpacks are verboten at
the event, a nod to an Indio ordinance and security issues. You can
wear fanny packs, however, if they fit your fashion sensibility.</LD>
<TE>   Other banned items that will have you turned back for a long walk
to the parking lot include tents, flags, blankets, boda bags, stuffed
animals and musical instruments (sorry, kid, no auditions this time).
Drugs and weapons are most assuredly not allowed, and undercover
police will work the crowd. As for photographs, each fan is allowed
to bring one disposable camera.</TE>
<TE>   Weather watch: Fans who attended the first Coachella festival in
October 1999 still talk about the heat. It should be a milder affair
this time around. Weather Central, which provides forecasts for The
Times, predicts partly cloudy skies both days with highs in the upper
70s on Saturday and in the mid-70s on Sunday. At night, expect those
temperatures to drop into the low 50s. Winds are expected, some to 30
mph.</TE>
<TE>   Essentials: Interstate 10 will get you east to Indio and, once
there, electronic signs on the freeway shoulder will mark the best
exits to get you over to the Empire Polo Field. Tickets--$75 for one
day, $125 for a two-day pass--are available through Ticketmaster or
at the venue. Parking is free. There's no overnight camping at the
venue so for lodging information or other details, check out
www.goldenvoice.com.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The attractive and charismatic Sue Turner-Cray conceived a bigger
life and pulled herself, like a real-life Shirley Valentine, out of
the "prison sentence" of her dead-end industrial hometown of
Leicester, England. Her pursuit of more fulfilling possibilities in
the international modeling industry during the high-flying 1980s form
the basis of "Manchester Girl," an energetic and engaging solo show
at the Hudson Mainstage.</LD>
<LD>   Her story ricochets between humorous and tragic extremes,
chronicling the transformation of a sweetly trusting young girl into
a jaded sophisticate while doing catalog work in Japan, where she
learned the hard way that "the rules of home don't apply." What the
piece lacks in comparison to more artfully constructed fiction, it
more than compensates with the immediacy of personal confession that
doesn't flinch from self-criticism.</LD>
<LD>   Tracing her descent into diet pills, drugs and destructive
liaisons, the events she describes are a familiar recipe for an
insecure psyche who kept looking for validation from others, until
finally recognizing her true identity was there all along.</LD>
<TE>   What elevates her story above the monologue-as-therapy cliche are
her insightful perceptions and pinpoint characterizations of the
bizarre personalities she encountered in her travels. The acting
training that Turner-Cray pursued after she quit modeling has paid
off handsomely in skillfully rendered voices, mannerisms and body
postures of the oafish agency office manager who wanted to keep her
in a secretarial position, or the overseas agent who pressures her
models to lose weight even as she ceaselessly stuffs herself with
food. Best of all are her effortless changes, without losing a
conversational beat, into the worldly, brilliant Peruvian lover who
opened her cultural horizons.</TE>
<TE>   Lively staging by Amy Wieczoreck puts the hard-working performer
through extensive dance and movement workouts, to a wry soundtrack
tour of the era's giddy, vacuous rock tunes. Her catwalk strutting
with fan-blown hair is a hilarious image, though it's repeated more
times than necessary. Nevertheless, despite an unusual running length
for a solo performance, Turner-Cray doesn't let us regret a minute
spent in her company.</TE>

<LD>Perennial favorites and some promising new faces were among the
directors bringing their work to this year's Cannes Film Festival,
which also acknowledges the simmering Mideast conflict with an
Israeli and a Palestinian film presented as "acts of peace."</LD>
<LD>   The selection announced Wednesday includes 22 films competing for
the festival's biggest prize, the Palme d'Or. Four former winners are
returning: British director Mike Leigh ("Secrets &amp; Lies"), Iranian
filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami ("The Taste of Cherry") and Jean-Pierre
and Luc Dardenne of Belgium ("Rosetta").</LD>
<LD>   Among the U.S. entries, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore
("Roger &amp; Me") will present "Bowling for Columbine," which takes a
look at the gun culture, starting with the 1999 shootings at
Columbine High School in Colorado.</LD>
<TE>   Also on the slate is the fourth film from Paul Thomas Anderson
("Magnolia"), titled "Punch-Drunk Love" and starring Adam Sandler and
Emily Watson. Director Alexander Payne ("Election") presents "About
Schmidt," with Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates, about a man trying to
run his daughter's life.</TE>
<TE>   Roman Polanski ("Rosemary's Baby") will be at Cannes with "The
Pianist," with Adrien Brody, about a man who survives the destruction
of the Warsaw ghetto during World War II. And David Cronenberg, the
Canadian director who headed the Cannes jury in 1999, is back with
"Spider," about a man with acute schizophrenia, starring Ralph
Fiennes, Miranda Richardson and Lynn Redgrave.</TE>
<TE>   British director Ken Loach is back with "Sweet Sixteen." Britain
is also represented by Leigh with "All or Nothing," about a weekend
in a London housing project, and Michael Winterbottom, with "24-Hour
Party People."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli director Amos Gitai, who presented "Kadosh" and "Kippur,"
is back for the third time in four years with "Kedma." Elia Suleiman,
a Palestinian, presents "Intervention Divine."</TE>
<TE>   From Asia, South Korean director Im Kwon-taek, who presented the
visually sumptuous "Chunhyang" in 2000, is back with "Chihwaseon."
China is represented by Jia Zhang Ke's "Ren Xiao Yao (Unknown
Pleasures)."</TE>
<TE>   Kiarostami is back with "10," and the Dardenne brothers are

<HD>A Cure for Those Monday Blahs</HD>
<DH>Across L.A., promoters are turning an off-night into a hot
evening for sampling new talent and veterans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEIDI SIEGMUND CUDA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's just another Monday at the Viper Room and you can smell the
rock. It's Camaro night, the house party for L.A.'s blowin'-up rock
scene, and Loaded, the new band fronted by Guns N' Roses bassist Duff
McKagan, is blazing away on stage. The guests look like extras from
hell, clad in black and leather with hip-swingin' chains.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, it's a school night. But for L.A.'s rock-loving set, Monday
may be the most important night of the week, when clubs like the
Viper Room, Spaceland and the Troubadour offer first-class talent for
cheap. It's a night when club owners can afford to take chances and
new bands can build audiences. The people who go out on Mondays are
serious about hearing music.</LD>
<LD>   "I love the scene because it's always the best bands," says Kerol
Rae, a Hollywood resident who often spends her Monday nights flitting
between the Viper Room and the Troubadour. "You get turned on to
local bands like Motochrist and can also check out what veteran
rockers are up to."</LD>
<TE>   The low-key vibe and level playing field--many venues are
free--make Monday more inviting than a Friday or Saturday night, when
the tourists up the ante. Monday's night owls own the streets,
leaving the crowds, the jacked-up valet rates and high cover charges
for the weekenders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a professional night, there's no amateurs," says Casper, a
long-haired rocker and scenester who rarely misses Camaro. "The
people who go out on Mondays are nightclub people and they want to
hear rock 'n' roll. Nobody stumbles in on accident."</TE>
<TE>   Sal Jenco, the Viper Room's impresario, started Camaro two years
ago as a sendup of '80s rock, featuring the rock 'n' roll cutups
Metal Shop. But what started out as a heavy metal parody has become
one of the best places to check out new acts. Booker Dayle Gloria has
brought in up-and-coming bands such as Otep, which is releasing its
Capitol Records debut this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night's reasonably priced shows are pivotal to developing
new bands. Alumni of the Troubadour's Monday-night rock shows, for
instance, constitute a veritable who's who of the alternative music
scene.</TE>
<TE>   "We launched Papa Roach out of the Troubadour's free Mondays,"
says Brett Bair, who manages Papa Roach, Leisure and Hoobestank. The
Troubadour's free Monday showcases have become a launching pad for
the second stage of the Ozzfest, with Papa Roach, Static X, Disturbed
and Staind each gaining widespread attention there.</TE>
<TE>   Music lovers who wouldn't dream of driving west of Vermont have
their own week-starting haven in Spaceland. The Silver Lake alt-rock
club has been the site of free Monday-night rock residencies since
1996, showcasing rock acts such as Tsar, the Hangmen, the Negro
Problem and Popdefect over the years. But surprise guests can be as
much of a draw as the resident bands. Elliott Smith, Fiona Apple and
producer Daniel Lanois have been known to swing by.</TE>
<TE>   "Spaceland's an arena for musical spontaneity," says Lanois, best
known for producing U2's albums. "I like the cross-section of folks
they get in there, including the clientele, and I particularly
appreciate the absence of radio-communicated muscle. It's kinda
folksy in there."</TE>
<TE>   Other clubs, including the Joint on Pico Boulevard and Coconut
Teaszer on the Sunset Strip, turned bunk nights into packed houses by
offering cheap rock shows and drink specials. In the world of
electronic music, Mick Cole and Freddy Be--a.k.a. the Bud
Brothers--have smoked the competition since '96 with their Monday
Social. Groove Armada, the Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim were
spinning there years before L.A.'s electronic music scene exploded.</TE>
<TE>   "We started the night because no one would book us," says Freddy
Be, himself a DJ. "It just blew up from there." Formerly at Louis
XIV, the Monday Social picked up steam earlier this year when it
moved to the booming Hollywood club Las Palmas.</TE>
<TE>   Although clubs are seeing a brisk resurgence, L.A.'s love affair
with Mondays dates to the '80s, when the Whisky was the site of the
No Bozos jam sessions. Rockers turned out in force; fans were drawn
by the titillation of hanging out with the era's biggest stars. In
the '90s, Club Lingerie's free Monday shows provided a stage for
Weezer and Wax to polish their talents in front of large crowds.</TE>
<TE>   These Mondays, Camaro's Metal Shop is king. Each week, singer Mike
Diamond strolls into the Viper Room with a stripper on each arm.
Wearing bun-hugging spandex pants, he takes the stage and bursts into
his "dude"-laced routine. By the time the real bass player from White
Snake jumps on stage and they launch into "Genie in a Bottle" (with
Christina Aguilera in the house, by the way), the crowd is TKO'd. And
when they wake up, it'll only be Tuesday.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The name of Tokyo-born Michiko Soffer's first restaurant was the
Japanese word for first generation, and no one in Newport Beach
seemed to mind that it was spelled Issay, rather than the standard
issei. Until it was destroyed in a fire two years ago, Issay had a
loyal following, a great wine list and a menu of satisfying Italian
dishes.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, that's right, Italian. It was an Italian restaurant that just
happened to have an oddly spelled Japanese name.</LD>
<LD>   Now she has opened a new place, and she's named it Nesai,
representing the Japanese word for second generation. Well, that
makes sense, although the word is generally spelled nisei. (Soffer is
unapologetic about the spelling. "The sign painters made a mistake,"
she says.)</LD>
<TE>   So what does her No. 2 restaurant serve? Two cuisines: the Italian
dishes she built a reputation on and Japanese dishes.</TE>
<TE>   But this is not accomplished as some kind of Japanese-Italian
fusion cuisine. There are two chefs, Nicolo Achille from Italy and
Hideo Matsuda, who specializes in Japanese pub food, and two menus.</TE>
<TE>   The decor is much the same as when this was the Stuft Noodle. It's
still a long, narrow, comfortable room, filled with plants, paintings
and comfortable booths. In the front, there's a wooden bar where you
can have bruschetta or a spicy tuna roll. This might look like a fern
bar from the '60s, but the food is distinctly better. The regular
menu is Italian, but the equally long nightly specials board is
mostly Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   The reason is simple: Matsuda's dishes are based on what fish are
fresh that day.</TE>
<TE>   So you might start with calamari arrabbiata, squid in a spicy
marinara sauce, or the magnificent smoked calamari: tender, nut-brown
slices served on a potato salad shot through with tartar sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Or you could have Manila clams and rock shrimp sauteed in a
garlicky white sauce or seared albacore dressed with a biting
Japanese citrus vinaigrette. The obvious path is to experience both
sides of the menu.</TE>
<TE>   This is by no means a sushi bar, but Matsuda, who once was chef at
a local restaurant named I Love Sushi, still makes spicy tuna rolls
set off with a fiery cucumber and red chile concoction.</TE>
<TE>   One of his more elegant starters is tender barbecued sea eel
glazed with an unctuous sauce dominated by shiitake mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   One evening, the Italian chef made grainy risotto with shrimp,
porcini mushrooms and lemon-infused olive oil. On another, there was
gnocchi with duck breast and pesto.</TE>
<TE>   The pasta choices are fairly standard, but all are done with
intelligent restraint. One of the best is pasta puttanesca, with a
sauce of fresh tomatoes, capers, olives, garlic and a touch of
anchovy.</TE>
<TE>   Most puttanescas in our part of the world hit you over the head.
This is a subtle version; as a matter of fact, it's the sort of
puttanesca you'd get at an Italian restaurant in Tokyo's Ginza.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian entrees are disarmingly simple and straightforward.
The salmon piccata is almost a minimalist version. The richest dish,
veal scaloppine, has a nicely reduced green peppercorn demi-glaze.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, Matsuda ventures into entrees too, but his journey
is less consistent. Chilean sea bass is well suited to its mild
marinade, white miso citrus emulsion. But it's hard to fathom the
chipotle beef: short ribs marinated in too much Grand Marnier as well
as the smoked version of the jalapeno chile. The beef, cut into small
Chinese-style pieces, is distressingly sweet.</TE>
<TE>   There are only three desserts. One is a rather classic homemade
tiramisu, heavy on the mascarpone and with an even heavier layer of
powdered chocolate than usual. Torta di nonna ("grandmother's cake")
is a dense lemon torte, two crusty layers with a light lemon mousse
in the center. Finally, there is a somewhat dry mocha marble cake.</TE>
<TE>   If you're lucky, you'll be served by Soffer's charming daughter
Shima, a beautiful woman whose name means island. She is herself a
fusion of two cultures, a true nisei, regardless of how you spell it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nesai, 215-17 Riverside Ave., Newport Beach. (949) 646-2333.
Dinner, 5-10 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Full bar. Parking lot. All
major cards. Dinner for two, $36-$59.</TE>
<TE>   What to Get: smoked calamari, spicy tuna roll, penne puttanesca,
veal scaloppine.</TE>

<LD>SIOUXSIE &amp; THE BANSHEES</LD>
<LD>   Even at a cutting-edge music festival, someone's got to represent
the old school. So why not veteran British goth-punk Siouxsie Sioux
and her gang, who reunited this month for a five-show tour set to end
at Coachella?</LD>
<LD>   The band, which broke up shortly after the release of 1995's "The
Rapture," reconvenes with vocalist Sioux, co-founding bassist Steve
Severin, ex-Vibrators guitarist Knox and Sioux's drummer (and
husband) Budgie.</LD>
<TE>   After turning their late-'70s worship of the Sex Pistols into
their own abrasively bleak original thing, Sioux et al became one of
British punk's most enduring and influential acts. Erotic,
dispassionate, playful and dire (sometimes all at once), the music
made countless disaffected souls feel as if someone understood.
Saturday.</TE>

<TE>   ZERO 7</TE>
<TE>   The British duo of producers Sam Hardaker and Henry Binns fuses
modern dance music styles with the feel of classic funk, jazz and
soul into a relaxed yet sprightly vibe on its debut album, "Simple
Things." The pair has remixed songs for acts as diverse as Radiohead,
Lenny Kravitz and Lambchop. But don't expect much knob-twiddling on
stage--this act comes complete with three vocalists and an 11-piece
band. Sunday. --N.N.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE (INTERNATIONAL) NOISE CONSPIRACY</TE>
<TE>   Sick of modern punks moaning about personal turmoil? Then c'mon
and fight the good fight with these Swedish political provocateurs,
who blend '60s garage-rock catchiness with '70s punk urgency for an
explosive cocktail of rock 'n' revolution. Though intellectuals on
paper, the identically dressed players evoke the MC5's
smash-the-state intensity in concert. Although the group righteously
skewers global capitalism and its attendant ills, its high-energy
calls to arms won't make you feel stuck in the middle of some boring
lecture. That's edu-tainment, baby! Saturday. --N.N.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE STROKES</TE>
<TE>   If rock greatness were all about creating a buzz, these New
Yorkers already would be assured a spot in the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame. In 18 months, they went from being a nonentity on the New York
club scene to being featured in almost every pop magazine in the free
world and selling half a million albums in this country.</TE>
<TE>   But are the Strokes anything more than a cheeky walk down memory
lane? The quintet does a knockout Lou Reed on its debut album, "Is
This It?," and they remind you of Reed's old band the Velvet
Underground, as well as other New York outfits such as Television and
the New York Dolls.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not convinced, but Coachella will be a major test. If the
crowd is entranced during "Last Nite," the MTV hit from the album,
the Strokes might be it after all. Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   --Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BELLE &amp; SEBASTIAN</TE>
<TE>   The English ensemble is the poster act for a new wave of
twee-pop--poetic sensibilities, hushed vocals from Stuart Murdoch and
Isobel Campbell, restrained but colorful chamber-folk arrangements
dealing more in nuance than immediacy. Their 2000 album, "Fold Your
Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant," saw the band expanding its
textural and emotional range, and last year the group stretched
further, composing songs and the score for the Todd Solondz film
"Storytelling," with a soundtrack album due in June.</TE>
<TE>   Some find B&amp;S seductive, others too precious. Most of the time
it's both. Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHEMICAL BROTHERS</TE>
<TE>   Arguably the most influential act on today's electronic scene, Tom
Rowlands and Ed Simons have established themselves as true stars of
the genre, largely based on such big-beat hits as "Block Rockin'
Beats" and "It Began in Afrika." Though the duo is mostly known for
its original music, it tore up the main DJ tent at last year's
Coachella festival with an invigorating mix that ranged from house
and trance to world. After the excellent studio album "Come With Us,"
there's no reason to believe this year's appearance will be any less
impressive. Part of the appeal of the Chemical Brothers is that the
duo loves all types of music, something that certainly comes across
in its DJ sets. So don't be surprised when the familiar refrain of
"Block Rockin' Beats" or "Music: Response" leads into a scintillating
African rhythm or a Brazilian samba. Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   --S.B.</TE>

<TE>   SASHA &amp; DIGWEED, JIMMY VAN M</TE>
<TE>   During a triumphant though brief reunion tour last year, DJs Sasha
and John Digweed dazzled a sold-out crowd at the Mayan Theatre.
Buoyed by that success, the pair, along with opening act and friend
Jimmy Van M, are undertaking the first arena tour by a DJ act, with
Coachella as its Southern California stop.</TE>
<TE>   Close followers of the DJ world know Sasha and Digweed as the most
formidable pair of DJs in the genre. When they take turns bouncing
keyboard-rich trance hooks and delivering show-stopping rises, fans
beyond dance will understand the fuss. Saturday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KOSHEEN</TE>
<TE>   The English trio built its European following around its energetic
live show, and at Coachella, the core lineup will be augmented by a
bassist and a cellist, bringing new life to the songs from the band's
stirring debut, "Resist." Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BJORK</TE>
<TE>   Even under normal circumstances you can't be sure what this pop
provocateur will come up with, so when she plans a surprise, it's
best to be ready for anything. Just last year, Bjork released a
typically ambitious album ("Vespertine"), gave acoustic concerts in
candle-lit churches in Europe and New York, toured with a show
featuring a full orchestra and a choir of Inuit women from Greenland,
and received a best song Oscar nomination for "I've Seen It All." She
wrote the song for "Dancer in the Dark," the Lars von Trier film in
which she also starred.</TE>
<TE>   Bjork's music mixes electronic, dance and ambient with cabaret,
folk and pop, framing a voice as powerful as it is idiosyncratic. To
her devoted fans, she's become a quirky Pied Piper in search of an
ideal of pure beauty. Saturday. --Richard Cromelin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CORNERSHOP</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long ago that Tjinder Singh, a Londoner of Indian
descent, and his partner Ben Ayres were poised to conquer the world.
Their eccentric blend of Indian instruments, rock dynamics, pop
hooks, hip-hop beats and sampled collages made Cornershop's 1997
album, "When I Was Born for the 7th Time," an attention-getting
near-breakthrough. But instead of setting up shop, they broke up.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, Cornershop has returned with an even more
intoxicating take on its signature sound. The recently released album
"Handcream for a Generation" is a speaker-hopping, swirling,
cross-cultural ferment of funk, garage rock, Punjabi pop and
psychedelic excavation. If their live show captures half of its giddy
fervor, it could be the set of the weekend. Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   --R.C.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OASIS</TE>
<TE>   "You're my sunshine, you're my rain," Liam Gallagher sings in "The
Hindu Times," the new Oasis single, and the contrasting images
summarize the Gallagher brothers' sometimes warm, sometimes stormy
relationship--with each other and with American rock fans.</TE>
<TE>   Blessed with melodies as seductive as Lennon-McCartney's, Oasis
arrived in England in the mid-'90s with "Definitely Maybe," an album
that triggered a response reminiscent of Beatlemania. Thanks to the
wonderfully uplifting "Live Forever" and "Wonderwall," Oasis even
started getting momentum in this country, giving the U.S. a
refreshing break from the relentless darkness and anxiety of most
American rock. "Definitely Maybe" sold 3 million copies here, but
things suddenly began to unravel.</TE>
<TE>   The Gallaghers may have eventually overcome Liam's aloof stage
presence and their tedious squabbling, but a sharp decline in the
quality of the music on the 2000 album "Standing on the Shoulders of
Giants" had the ring of a death knell. Oasis' shows last summer with
the Black Crowes, however, were encouraging. The band returns with a
new album in July, and we should hear bits of it at Coachella. The
reaction may tell us whether the future for the band is blue skies or
gray. Sunday. --R.H.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE PRODIGY</TE>
<TE>   The group hit the pop-rock world like a meteor six years ago,
mixing rock dynamics and dance rhythms so gloriously in the single
"Firestarter" that the record felt every bit as revolutionary as
Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit." MTV was so enthusiastic that it
started revising its playlist, just in case techno became the next
big thing in pop-rock.</TE>
<TE>   Britain's Q magazine, in fact, is still so in love with
"Firestarter" that it just named it the second most exciting single
ever--four spots ahead of "Teen Spirit" and one behind the Sex
Pistols' "God Save the Queen."</TE>
<TE>   The band's live shows--featuring the colorful Keith Flint in the
role of a Johnny Rotten-like rebel out front, while group leader Liam
Howlett controlled the sound from the synthesizer panel in the
back--were equally thrilling, with such other tracks as the
controversial "Smack My Bitch Up" and "Serial Thrilla" fueling the
fire.</TE>
<TE>   After all this, Howlett bought a big house in the English
countryside and began thinking--very slowly--about a new album. That
CD is due this fall, and some tracks will be showcased here. Will the
flame still burn? Sunday.</TE>

<LD>Making noise just below the must-see level is a crowded roster of
artists worth taking that extra step to see, either for the curiosity
factor or for a reliable dose of quality.</LD>
<LD>   CHARLATANS U.K.</LD>
<LD>   You might want to visit the Charlatans' set simply as a sympathy
vote. The English group's snake-bitten career has been waylaid by
arrests, embezzlement and death, but they bounced back last year with
"Wonderland," an album that combined their classic Stones/Faces vibe
with the grooves of their hometown, Manchester. Their recent Palace
concert captured the against-the-odds spirit that's become their
subtext. Saturday. --R.C.</LD>
<TE>   DAN THE AUTOMATOR</TE>
<TE>   Concept-happy producing whiz Dan "The Automator" Nakamura has been
a force in many innovative acts over the last decade, including
cartoon hip-hoppers Gorillaz, the mock-suave Handsome Boy Modeling
School and alt-rap icon Kool Keith's lascivious Dr. Octagon
character. Recently Nakamura toured as his Modeling School persona,
Nathaniel Merriweather, to present the tongue-in-cheek seduction of
"Lovage: Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By," a collection
blending cocktail-culture mating rituals and thoroughly modern
mixology. And his new "Wanna Buy a Monkey?" is a mix album
underscoring his fine DJ skills. Whatever he does should be
intriguing. Saturday. --N.N.</TE>
<TE>   FOLK IMPLOSION</TE>
<TE>   After 10 years and four albums (the most recent being 1999's "One
Part Lullaby"), the lo-fi duo of Sebadoh's Lou Barlow and friend John
Davis is calling it quits after the Coachella appearance, according
to Barlow's Web site. Best known for the song "Natural One," featured
on the soundtrack of the 1995 film "Kids," F.I. has employed a couple
of dozen instruments, including cookie sheets and glasses of water,
in its charmingly homemade music. Barlow has formed a new,
as-yet-unnamed band. Saturday. --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   FOREST FOR THE TREES</TE>
<TE>   Carl Stephenson, who co-wrote "Loser" with Beck and who records
under the name Forest for the Trees, battled a brain disorder five
years ago to release a long-awaited debut album that was a striking
mix of exotic musical textures and moods. He's now completing his
follow-up, and this is a rare public performance. Saturday. --R.H.</TE>
<TE>   JACK JOHNSON</TE>
<TE>   The pro surfer and surf filmmaker has become a music phenom not
with the shredding metal and punk of extreme sports, but with a
positive, beachcomber vibe in his easygoing yet sharp-eyed songs.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawaii-raised, Santa Barbara-based singer-songwriter's debut
album, "Brushfire Fairytales," has been a steadily growing success
since it was released by tiny Enjoy Records last year, initially sold
mostly in surf and skate shops. Now, with screaming girls crowding
his concerts and radio play starting to come, he's been picked up by
major Universal Records. Saturday. --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   JURASSIC 5</TE>
<TE>   The flagship of L.A.'s progressive/alternative rap scene released
its debut album in 2000. "Quality Control" is a freewheeling but
purposeful collection driven by rhythmic insistence and a restless
originality. Saturday. --R.C.</TE>
<TE>   KRS-ONE</TE>
<TE>   KRS-One (real name: Kris Parker) has been around almost as long as
rap itself, and he has as profound an understanding of the music's
creative and social history as fellow New Yorker Chuck D. His early
albums under the Boogie Down Productions name, including the
trailblazing "Criminal Minded," were essential building blocks in
hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   On last year's well-received "The Sneak Attack," the socially
conscious KRS-One, who likes to think of himself as a teacher as much
as a musician, demonstrated that he remains one of the genre's most
gifted and illuminating figures. Saturday. --R.H.</TE>
<TE>   LIQUID TODD</TE>
<TE>   The disc jockey has become a star in New York through his own
radio show. Before celebrity came, though, Liquid Todd was shaking up
dance floors with his mix of big beats and large trance hooks.
Saturday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   PHARCYDE</TE>
<TE>   Not as big on the national scene at it might have been because of
the group's infrequent appearances over the years, the Pharcyde
nevertheless remains a major part of the local scene. The rap group's
brash and irreverent rhymes are always a crowd-pleaser. Saturday.
--S.B.</TE>
<TE>   PRINCESS SUPERSTAR</TE>
<TE>   New York's Princess Superstar (a.k.a. Concetta Kirshner) is
hip-hop's answer to Ani DiFranco. Along with writing and producing
such hilariously lascivious collections as last year's "Princess
Superstar Is," she runs her own label, the Corrupt Conglomerate. Such
playfully X-rated material as "Bad Babysitter" is good fun, but the
Princess also cleverly twists pop-culture references into sharp
critiques of wannabes ("You Get Mad at Napster") and the music biz
("Trouble"). Live hip-hop can be an iffy proposition, but this is
worth the gamble. Saturday. --N.N.</TE>
<TE>   QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE</TE>
<TE>   Nobody on the bill will be closer to home than the Queens, whose
key members hail from nearby Low Desert communities. The band's
seriously hard and heavy rock has drawn a small, intense audience,
but the Queens have suddenly taken on an added luster with the
arrival of the Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl as their current drummer.
Grohl, who's playing with both bands this weekend, helped make the
Queens' recent Troubadour performance one of the town's most
buzzed-about club shows of the year. Saturday. --R.C.</TE>
<TE>   SAUL WILLIAMS</TE>
<TE>   The New York hip-hop poet's 2001 debut album, "Amethyst Rock
Star," was produced by Rick Rubin and shows the intense, erudite
Williams as part of a social-critic lineage running from the Last
Poets through Public Enemy, with a live band featuring cello and
viola giving him distinctive musical contexts. Saturday. --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   THE VINES</TE>
<TE>   Needing a drummer while recording its upcoming debut album in L.A.
recently, this young Australian group reportedly tried to get Ringo
Starr. They weren't successful, but their love for the Beatles (circa
the "White Album") is evident in the record--in equal measures with a
debt to Nirvana, as Craig Nicholls' mid-range voice switches between
giddy glide and grunge growl. The mix of polish and power has made
the band an early sensation in England alongside fellow imports the
Strokes and the White Stripes, and has created an anticipatory buzz
here, with the album "Highly Evolved" due July 16. Saturday. --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   BLONDE REDHEAD</TE>
<TE>   Japan's Kazu Makino and Italian twins Simone and Amedeo Pace
specialize in melodic yet dissonant indie-pop. Makino's high voice
might grate on some, but the moody, poignant 2000 collection "Melody
of Certain Damaged Lemons" has a breathless, muscular charm. Sunday.
--N.N.</TE>
<TE>   BT</TE>
<TE>   Despite his assertions a few years ago that he is not a DJ, trance
star Brian Transeau has been making some rounds on the DJ circuit,
including a recent stint at Miami's Winter Music Conference. BT knows
his grooves and how to work a crowd, so he should make an impression
at Coachella. Sunday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   DJ DAN, CUT CHEMIST, SANDRA</TE>
<TE>   COLLINS, MIXMASTER MIKE,</TE>
<TE>   DJ BABA G--SOUNDZ OF THE</TE>
<TE>   ASIAN UNDERGROUND</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles fans can take pride in the DJs representing the local
scene at this year's Coachella. Trance stars DJ Dan and Collins,
above, and turntablists Cut Chemist (of Jurassic 5) and Mixmaster
Mike should be among the highlights of the festival. Chemist can be
counted on for some quirky selections and skilled scratching, and
Collins should be up for the opportunity to show hometown fans she
can compete with the international stars. DJ Dan may be the sleeper.
At last year's Electric Daisy Carnival, his dramatic rises filled the
cavernous Hansen Dam area, meaning he's prepared for the challenge of
the large spaces beyond the Coachella stages. Saturday (Baba G) and
Sunday (the rest). --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   FOO FIGHTERS</TE>
<TE>   Dave Grohl will be doing double duty at Coachella, fronting his
own Foo Fighters on Sunday and drumming Saturday for the Queens of
the Stone Age. But Grohl pledges that the Foo Fighters remain his
priority, and the new album is due in the fall. It's been easy to
take the Foo Fighters for granted, both for the persistent shadow of
Nirvana (in which Grohl was the drummer) and for the consistent craft
of his songs. But Grohl and the Foos have regularly transcended both,
carving out their own power-punk territory adjacent to but not
overlapping with Nirvana's sacred ground and imbuing the song-craft
with intelligent and subtle depths. Sunday. --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   GALACTIC</TE>
<TE>   Bringing New Orleans funk to the jam band circuit, Galactic ranges
from instrumental jazz-fusion grooves a la Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood to
soul-blues when vocalist Theryl "Houseman" DeClouet steps out front.
Sunday. --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   HERBERT</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Herbert has been a prolific artist in the experimental
world since the 1990s, releasing tracks under the name Herbert,
Doctor Rockit and Wishmountain. Coming from the same vein as Mouse on
Mars and Plaid, Herbert takes all sounds electronic--house, techno,
synthesizers--and melds them into his own style. Sunday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   MARS VOLTA</TE>
<TE>   If At the Drive-In hadn't broken up last year, the explosive El
Paso band might well be one of the headliners this weekend. The
band's "Relationship of Command" album mixed punk and classic rock
sensibilities in spectacular fashion. Singer Cedric Bixler and
guitarist Omar Rodriguez hope to recapture the spark in their new
band. Sunday. --R.H.</TE>
<TE>   MOS DEF: BLACK JACK JOHNSON</TE>
<TE>   Rapper Mos Def isn't one to be fenced in. He's acting on Broadway
in the Pulitzer Prize-winning play "Topdog/Underdog," and now he
wants some rock action too. The Black Jack Johnson Project--whose
long-anticipated album has yet to be released--aims to tear down the
walls between black music and rock music, and Mos Def has the right
band for the job. Bassist Doug Wimbush and drummer Will Calhoun were
the rhythm section of Living Colour, which undertook a similar
mission in the early '80s, guitarist Dr. Know hails from the
legendary black punk-reggae band Bad Brains, and veteran keyboardist
Bernie Worrell played with the genre-blending Parliament-Funkadelic.
Sunday. --R.C.</TE>
<TE>   OZOMATLI</TE>
<TE>   A live setting is the best way to experience East L.A.'s funky
Afro-Latin hip-hop rockers, who fuse messages of unity and protest
with traditional and modern styles for a
get-the-party-started/keep-the- party-going groove. Singing and
rapping in Spanish and English while wielding horns, guitars, drums
and percussion instruments, the players don't hesitate to swarm the
audience, creating a street-style camaraderie. Sunday. --N.N.</TE>
<TE>   PAUL OAKENFOLD</TE>
<TE>   Of the royal court of DJs, this Englishman has made the greatest
inroads into the mainstream, including an accolade as Rolling Stone
magazine's Hot DJ in 2000 and a gig scoring last year's John
Travolta-Halle Berry flick "Swordfish." At last year's Coachella,
Oakenfold was on the main stage before Jane's Addiction. Because of
the large crowd and a poor setup for decks, his set fell below the
standard of his reputation. Presumably, that experience, and a
successful stint ushering in this past New Year on Hollywood
Boulevard, have prepared Oakenfold for the large setting. The talent
and drive are there, so expect the king of trance to fill the night
sky with the kind of larger-than-life grooves that fans have come to
expect. Sunday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   PETE TONG</TE>
<TE>   Though not a household name in the States, the British DJ is a
star in his native land. The host of the influential BBC radio show
"Essential Selections," Tong first brought house music to the U.K. in
the mid-'80s. Since then he has remained at the forefront of the
dance world, so expect his Coachella set to showcase cutting-edge
music from around the globe. Sunday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   PING PONG BITCHES</TE>
<TE>   Their crude, hard-hitting electro-punk may be only slightly above
karaoke quality, but these three Englishwomen in leather and stiletto
heels have gained support from Creation Records founder Alan McGee,
Sex Pistol Steve Jones and Roxy Music's Phil Manzanera (both of whom
contributed to their EP) and noted sensationalist Malcolm McLaren
(who managed them briefly). Sunday. --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   SOUND TRIBE SECTOR 9</TE>
<TE>   Glow sticks or tie-dye? Take both for STS9, a Bay Area band that
weaves electronica aesthetics with jam band interplay. The resulting
organica at times echoes Miles Davis' early-'70s explorations.
Sunday. --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   TIESTO</TE>
<TE>   The Netherlands' Tiesto, perhaps the fastest-rising comer on the
DJ scene, finally gets a proper coming out in Southern California.
Though he's spun at Giant and local raves, this will be the first
chance for many to lose themselves in Tiesto's mind-expanding trance
hooks. Sunday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   TRIPLE THREAT</TE>
<TE>   Triple Threat has taken its years of experience competing on the
turntable circuit and fused them with a party mentality that utilizes
the music of dancehall, hip-hop, soul, funk and more. Sunday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The C-List</TE>
<TE>   Coachella has steered clear of any real must-avoids, but there is
a layer of artists who are too familiar and/or a little unremarkable
to call for an extra effort.</TE>
<TE>   THE BETA BAND</TE>
<TE>   If you know the Betas only from the scene in "High Fidelity" in
which record store customers can't resist the group's sweeping
melodic charm, you may have the wrong idea about the group. As it
showed on tour last year with Radiohead, the Betas' music is as
quirky and unpredictable as it is winsome. It can be intriguing but
not always essential. Saturday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   CAKE</TE>
<TE>   Didn't somebody say irony was dead? Maybe that was premature,
given the success-at-last of these under-the-radar Sacramento
spoof-rockers' single "Short Skirt/Long Jacket." Achieving maximum
hyphenation with its alternative-funk-hip-hop-Latin-new-wave-
jazz-pop romps, the group can be wry to a fault and strangely bland
despite it all. But at least it doesn't take itself as seriously as
the Dave Matthews Band. Saturday. --N.N.</TE>
<TE>   CITIZEN COPE</TE>
<TE>   On his recent debut album, D.C.-reared Clarence Greenwood, a.k.a.
Citizen Cope, goes a little heavy-handed with biblical imagery (a
confrontation with a Porsche-driving devil in "Salvation"), eccentric
characters (the street-hustler portrait "200,000") and a wearily
jaundiced vocal delivery on the street-life short stories and
snapshots. Still, citing Randy Newman and Stevie Wonder among his
influences, he balances quiet despair with hope, echoed in the somber
keyboard textures and understated rhythms. Saturday. --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   G. LOVE &amp; SPECIAL SAUCE</TE>
<TE>   Taking folk-blues to Generation X, Philadelphian Garrett Dutton
can't match the real thing, but there's an attractive earnestness to
his and his backing duo's easygoing shuffles. Saturday. --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   GROOVE ARMADA</TE>
<TE>   In its studio work, the London-based duo of Andy Cato and Tom
Findlay is all about style. The pair's two albums, including last
year's "Goodbye Country, Hello Nightclub," feature slick ambient and
techno beats best suited to a late-night club. If that doesn't bode
well for their appearance in the large, outdoor areas of Coachella,
the pair's last L.A. gig, at Vynyl, offered a glimmer of hope in the
form of surprisingly accessible disco tunes and pop hooks. It's hard
to know what Groove Armada will bring to the table, but whatever it
is, fans can be sure it's at least worth checking out. Whether it's
worth staying around for depends on the style. Saturday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   LEE BURRIDGE</TE>
<TE>   Another product of the U.K. scene, Burridge brings a global
flavor, courtesy of training in Hong Kong, to his house mix. There
will be a lot of dancey and disco-esque beats, but expect them to be
cut with less predictable sounds. Saturday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   MIGUEL MIGS</TE>
<TE>   Expect the Santa Cruz-based DJ to provide the kind of dance-heavy
house flavor found on his recent "Nude Tempo, Vol. 1." Saturday.
--S.B.</TE>
<TE>   PETE YORN</TE>
<TE>   Yorn is frequently included on lists of promising young
singer-songwriters, and in his hit "Music for the Morning After"
album he shows that he knows how to craft a tune. The question is
originality and depth. If you measure him against the woeful pop-rock
norm these days, Yorn stands out. If you up the standards to a
reasonable level, he tends to melt away. Putting him under the huge
expectations of the Coachella festival spotlight is a gamble. If he
connects with the crowd, he may deserve critical reevaluation.
Saturday. --R.H.</TE>
<TE>   Z-TRIP</TE>
<TE>   The turntablist will display his scratching skills against an
array of hip-hop beats. Saturday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   BAD BOY BILL</TE>
<TE>   The DJ specializes in hard-house, which means the friendly and
warm dance beats of house will have a drum-and-bass edge. Sunday.
--S.B.</TE>
<TE>   CIRRUS</TE>
<TE>   One of the few live electronic acts on the bill, the Long Beach
quartet mixes trip-hop, acid house and other electronic sounds in a
hybrid that, while not revolutionary, should be interesting augmented
by live instruments. Sunday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   DILATED PEOPLES</TE>
<TE>   A steady presence on the L.A. alt-rap scene, but its last album,
"The Platform," is surprisingly faceless, despite guest spots from
B-Real and Tha Alkaholics. Sunday. --R.C.</TE>
<TE>   DJ PERETZ</TE>
<TE>   Though Peretz doesn't have the name recognition of many of his
fellow DJs (unless he goes by his real name, Perry Farrell), there's
no questioning his love and support of the electronic music scene.
Sunday. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   ELBOW</TE>
<TE>   "Prog without the solos" is the English band's much repeated
description of its music, which exudes much of the hyper-sensitive
feel of the Doves, Coldplay and many others across the Atlantic. Its
"Asleep in the Back" album has been acclaimed, but the lyrics add
little to the atmospheric sheen, leaving the music feeling
incomplete. Maybe they'll fill in some of the blanks live. Sunday.
--R.H.</TE>
<TE>   FAIRVIEW</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County band has spread its name with lots of touring in
the past two years. Its melodic, sometimes punkish rock doesn't stand
out from the field, but singer-keyboardist Grace Peters is a rare
female presence in the genre--and at the entire Coachella Festival,
for that matter. Sunday. --R.C.</TE>
<TE>   ROCK STEADY CREW</TE>
<TE>   That these hip-hoppers released their first single on influential
dance label Backspin says a lot about where their beat-laden rhymes
come from. --S.B.</TE>
<TE>   SAVES THE DAY</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey band, above right, tells coming-of-age stories,
with high, yearning vocals riding a throbbing stitchery of guitar and
drum. The lyrics can be provocative, but the sound makes youthful
rites of passage seem more like a school picnic than a fight for
life. Sunday. --R.C.</TE>
<TE>   WAGNER</TE>
<TE>   The three-piece from Riverside plays power-pop/rock with a
decidedly indie bent. Sunday. --S.B.</TE>

<HD>Sound Bites From the Pop Buffet</HD>
<DH>The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is a chance to
sample some of today's most cutting-edge music. But with so many
choices, it pays to know which acts are worth fighting the crowds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My favorite memory of the first Coachella Valley Music and Arts
Festival two years ago was standing in the middle of the Empire Polo
Field in Indio and being overwhelmed by music coming from five
distant stages. I could hear the roars of the separate crowds as
rival bands and DJs took the stages and I tried to decide which one
to check out.</LD>
<LD>   Pop music thrives on the discovery of exciting and original new
artists--stepping into a club or arena and being so swept away by the
artist's imagination and charisma that you feel a page in pop history
is being turned.</LD>
<LD>   My own list of memorable first encounters includes David Bowie at
the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium ... Bob Marley at the Roxy ... U2
at the Country Club ... Prince at Flippers ... Ani DiFranco at the
Mayan ... N.W.A at the Celebrity Theatre.</LD>
<TE>   Coachella has quickly become an important date on the Southern
California pop calendar because it offers so many chances to find new
favorites. Instead of seeing two or three acts in an evening, you can
see 20 to 30.</TE>
<TE>   Rock festivals have been a major part of the European pop scene
for years because they offer this kind of pop buffet. In the
Lollapalooza tour in the early '90s, Perry Farrell brought some of
that spirit here. But nothing in recent years in Southern California
has approached the pure musical feast of Coachella. Goldenvoice, the
L.A. concert firm that stages the festival, has dealt in cutting-edge
music for years, and Coachella's lineup reflects that spirit.</TE>
<TE>   The lineups are far from perfect. At a time when rock is blessed
with some passionate new arrivals, the dream package would have
brought many of those newcomers together in a sort of battle of the
bands. Imagine: the White Stripes and ... Trail of Dead on one stage
and the Hives and the Strokes on another. As it is, only the Strokes
will be appearing this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are lots of opportunities for discovery.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, Calendar has put together a critical guide to
the acts Saturday and Sunday, ranking them on a priority basis from
high to low. We start with the A-list.</TE>

<HD>Totally Gross, and Educational</HD>
<DH>The Discovery Science Center goes into detail to teach kids
about their bodies. Ewww.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGO WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul, 10, a bespectacled expert in many things gross, was boosted by
his dad above an excited Saturday morning crowd of parents and kids
so that he might be picked as an authority.</LD>
<LD>   But Sally Snot, clad in mismatched plaids with a ribbon of toilet
paper trailing from her shoe, didn't choose Paul in her search for
three young experts on those bodily functions that make kids smirk
and parents cringe. She drafted her helpers, then divided the group
into teams to compete in a "Gross Me Out" game show.</LD>
<LD>   Now playing weekends at the Discovery Science Center in Santa Ana,
"Gross Me Out" attempts to "use that gross element to teach some
good, solid educational information about the body," said Janet
Yamaguchi, the center's vice president of education and "Gross Me
Out" co-author. Snot, also known as actress Della Lisi, asked her
visitors, "Have you ever wondered what that gurgling noise was in
your belly? Well, that's peristalsis. Gas is going through your
intestines." She unspooled a hose and pulled it like a tamed snake
until it was 21 feet long. "This is the size of your small
intestines," she said. "Your large intestines are another five feet
and the gas has to go through them."</LD>
<TE>   Lisi translated the vernacular into more socially acceptable
terms. "Did you know farting is called flatulence or passing gas?"
She demonstrated facts about the body by using stick-in-your-mind
visual cues. With a volunteer to help her measure "my little brother
Scott Snot's urine," Lisi showed that the amount of fluid that enters
the body equals the amount that leaves, and that urine levels
fluctuate depending on how much you sweat and what kinds of fluids
you drink. When the demonstration was over, Lisi chug-a-lugged the
amber liquid. "Oh, I'm sorry," she apologized to the audience. "Did
you want some?"</TE>
<TE>   "Ewwwww!" the kids screamed.</TE>
<TE>   Lisi seized the moment. She explained that she really was just
drinking apple juice and that she would never drink urine. She also
quizzed the kids on their bathroom hygiene, making sure all agreed on
the value of flushing the toilet and washing their hands.</TE>
<TE>   After the show, Lisi, in a sleek, ungross black dress, said she
feels that "these are subjects that are kind of taboo. But they need
to be addressed so they can be euphemized and handled with manners
and etiquette."</TE>
<TE>   In the opinion of Bunni Tobias, a Lake Forest licensed educational
psychologist, "What they are doing is totally age-appropriate....
Children learn through their eyeballs, their fingers. They have to
touch it, feel it, slop in it. You learn through your sensory-motor
skills.... Once you create an interest, then kids have something to
learn about. They will read it, write it and conceptualize it."</TE>
<TE>   Gross facts and figures, such as how many bacteria are in the
human mouth (more than 100 million), and recipes and experiments,
such as Eyeball-O-Rama, are available through the museum's Web site,
www.discovery cube.org. Sarah Dingess, 13, of Fullerton, and her
sisters, Ashley and Rebecca, both 10, seemed to confirm Tobias'
assessment. Not only did they like the show, they planned to test the
mucus recipe at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I liked the urine the best because it looked like she was
drinking it," Ashley said. "I liked the slime because it looked
real," Sarah said. "Gross Me Out" is not the first science show to
try to reach kids by shocking them and making them laugh. A
Grossology traveling exhibit is now at Space Center Houston and is
part of a mini-empire of the gross from author Sylvia Branzei and
illustrator Jack Keely of the "Grossology" book series. But the
Grossology exhibit wasn't available, so the Discovery Center designed
its own program, Yamaguchi said.</TE>
<TE>   "Gross Me Out" is teamed with workshops relating to the human body
that are led by the center's education staff. Workshop topics include
"Walk Through the Eye," "Stroll Through the Heart," "Tour Through the
Digestive Tract" and "Mouths and What They Contain." The center
offers three or four of these hands-on workshops daily.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Resendez, 11, and brother David, 10, of Bellflower, and Omar
Prieto, 10, of Garden Grove, hunched over a table to match photos of
animals with mammals' skulls at a "Pictures and Skulls" workshop.
David said he left "Gross Me Out" early because "I like this better,"
although Omar said he thought "Gross Me Out" was cool. David and
Jesse's father, Felipe Resendez, said the boys had been at the center
since it opened that morning, had tested its bed of nails and had
showed no signs of flagging. "This would be a good place to come on
rainy days."</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Kim, of Torrance, and Yong Kim, of Palos Verdes, were
enthusiastic about "Gross Me Out." Kathy Kim said her son, Peter, 7,
is interested in science and actress Lisi "touched on the daily
things we all do, and now he knows why they happen and that it's not
something to be ashamed of." Peter said the show taught him about
"passing gas." Yong Kim's son, Grant, 7, added, "But it was gross."
The boys giggled. Peter agreed. "It still was gross."</TE>

<KH>MY FAVORITE WEEKEND</KH>

<LD>* The comedian, whose HBO comedy special was nominated for an ACE
Award in 1995, performs at the Coach House May 10.</LD>
<LD>   Regular Folk: I like the Normandie Room on Santa Monica Boulevard
in West Hollywood. It's just a little bar where they make a really
great martini with a shaker. It has a non-pretentious gay crowd--like
regular gay people--and there's a pool table. But it's not like a
scary pool bar. There's no great big dance floor and you're really
just walking in to hang out and talk. Even if it's crowded, it's not
a nightmare.</LD>
<LD>   Retail Hike: One of my favorite things in the world to do is to go
to the Beverly Center when it opens around 10 a.m. on weekends.
There's nobody there yet and I just work my way through the floors
and shop. It's like going back to nature, it's so relaxing for me. If
you grow up on the East Coast, it's exactly what you thought a
Hollywood mall was going to be like. I love it there, though they've
stopped carrying anything over a size 10.</LD>
<TE>   Stealing Home(wares): On Sunday mornings, my girlfriend and I get
crepes at the Farmers Market and then we go to the flea market on
Melrose and Fairfax. I found a leather footstool and I think I paid
$15 for it, but it looks like something the Pottery Barn would sell
for $600. My girlfriends have gotten used Levi's there for $5.</TE>
<TE>   Two Girls: I'm sort of associated with the Improv, but I also
really like the Comedy Store. There are so many different rooms like
the Belly Room, which is amateurs. I think gay comics have way more
to say right now. It's a little sexier and a little more vulgar. I
think listening to some woman talk about how she can't get a guy to
commit or a guy talking about his wife not wanting to have sex with
him, I mean, we've heard that a lot. With two girls together, you can
just have so much more fun. Do you think I have ever had to say to my
girlfriend, "Oh, I'm PMSed" and have her not understand? She sees me
being PMSed before I am PMSed.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the Bus: When friends come from the East Coast and they
want to do the tour of the Hollywood homes, we get a map and we stay
like three car lengths behind the actual Hollywood star tour. You can
hear them sometimes too, if you put your window down. And you're in
your own car, rather than that stupid bus. We've done that like three
or four times. It's very fun and silly, though I don't think they
like it.</TE>

<HD>Reese and Company Belt Out Joyful 'Message'</HD>
<DH>The ambitious show was conceived, written and directed by
the actress-minister.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Della Reese testifies mightily unto the Lord in "The Message Is in
the Music," her new gospel musical at Stage 52.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps best known for her regular role on the long-running
television series "Touched by an Angel," Reese has made her mark as a
nightclub singer, a writer and an ordained minister, preaching to
packed houses at her Los Angeles-based church, Understanding
Principles for Better Living.</LD>
<LD>   Combining all those disciplines, the massively ambitious "Message"
was conceived, written and directed by Reese, with additional music
by T.C. Campbell and Robert Henley III.</LD>
<TE>   The show features a big and accomplished cast, high-rent costumes
by Dr. Charles Brown and versatile sets by Marco De Leon. Reese also
stars, but she proves to be a surprisingly retiring diva who appears
in only two of the dozen-odd segments, otherwise generously yielding
the stage to her fellow performers, many of whom are also regular
members of her congregation.</TE>
<TE>   Forget subtlety. Explicitly didactic, the show makes no bones
about its evangelical agenda. Spreading the "good news" is the
business of the evening, and ardent nonbelievers might be put off by
this venture's single-minded simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   However, the best news about "Message" is that it is a joyful
noise, a rafters-raising exhortation featuring some of the best
gospel singers this side of "The Gospel at Colonus."</TE>
<TE>   The show consists of unrelated scenes, each illustrating a
particular Christian principle. In one scene, a woman whose lover has
been cheating is urged to forgive and forget by a nurturing friend.
In another, two teenage boys try to stop a pal from using a date-rape
drug. And in the play's poignant closing scene, Reese plays a
disgruntled wife issuing an impassioned ultimatum to her neglectful
husband.</TE>
<TE>   At times, the staging lapses into excess. In Reese's first big
scene, ballet dancers prance energetically around her, a distraction
from Reese's moment and her message. Also, a few lighting and sound
glitches marred the opening night performance of this otherwise
technically assured production.</TE>
<TE>   More a camp meeting than a play, this overlong and sometimes
rambling piece could benefit from a little judicious trimming.
However, the transcendent voices, particularly those of Henley,
William Hubbard Knight, the wonderful Patti Henley and of course
Reese herself make "Message" a special delivery.</TE>

Los Angeles. Thursdays to Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 6 p.m. Ends May

<HD>Chestnut Trio Stages Late Rally</HD>
<DH>Travel and jet lag may have hindered Cyrus Chestnut and his
group, but the performers regrouped for the finale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Musicians often say that they get paid to endure the discomforts of
touring. The reward for the performances, they add, is the sheer
pleasure of making music.</LD>
<LD>   There's undoubtedly some truth to all of that, but the fact
remains that taking flights, living in hotels and having to go on
stage a few hours after arriving in town can have a negative impact
upon the best of intentions.</LD>
<LD>   The opening set by pianist Cyrus Chestnut's trio at the Jazz
Bakery on Tuesday night was a case in point. Despite placing all the
notes in the right places, the group's music had a weary
quality--perhaps reflecting the fact that they reportedly had flown
in earlier in the day.</LD>
<TE>   At his best, Chestnut offers a vision of the jazz piano trio
combining elements of soul jazz and funk, with references to Ahmad
Jamal and Vince Guaraldi surfacing frequently. To his credit, there
usually is no real sense of imitativeness to his own playing or to
the ensemble arrangements. But when selections are offered with less
than their usual vitality, as they were on Tuesday, the influences
underlying Chestnut's music become more apparent than usual.</TE>
<TE>   In the opening part of the set, in particular, the tunes drifted
dangerously close to ambitious cocktail jazz, its lightweight
qualities emphasized by Chestnut's tendency to fill his solos with
melodic curlicues and filigrees in his right-hand
passages--particularly apparent in his reworking of Beethoven's "Fur
Elise" and his own original piece, "Nippon Soul Connection."</TE>
<TE>   The quality of the proceedings improved dramatically with a long
drum solo in which Neal Smith gave a spectacular display of playing
with brushes rather than sticks. Chestnut kept the level high with a
sensitive rendering of a spiritual, and the set's high point--a
rhythmically in-the-pocket romp through Chestnut's "In the
Underground"--was followed by a brief rendering of Duke Ellington's
"C Jam Blues."</TE>
<TE>   Why was the closing of the set so much better than the opening?
Jet lag, perhaps. But whatever the cause, it was good to hear
Chestnut, Smith and bassist Michael Hawkins gather their forces and
return so quickly to their usual high level of performance.</TE>
<TE>   The Cyrus Chestnut Trio at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., L.A.
Tonight through Sunday at 8 and 9:30 p.m., $25. (310) 271-9039.</TE>

<HD>Eitzel Still Hoping for the Best, Expecting Worst</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Hello, shoppers," said Mark Eitzel from the stage at the back of
Amoeba Records on Tuesday. "Buy my records. Or don't."</LD>
<LD>   The statement kicked off his in-store performance in the
well-lighted, warehouse-like Hollywood shop, with about 100 fans
crowded in the aisles near the stage while others went about their
shopping elsewhere. It was typical Eitzel. He may express
indifference, but it's a ruse, a defense mechanism.</LD>
<LD>   The Bay Area bard really does want people to buy his records; he
just expects that they won't. And in song, he really does want to
find love; he just expects that he won't.</LD>
<TE>   That, since his days leading the prized but under-most-radar
American Music Club and through an only slightly higher-profile solo
career, has made him sometimes hard to read, perhaps no more so than
in his interpretations of an odd assortment of standards and
obscurities on his new album, "Music for Courage &amp; Confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Wryly subtitled "Sentimental Hits of the '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s
and '80s," the album sees Eitzel toying with songs ranging from "I'll
Be Seeing You" to Culture Club's "Do You Really Want to Hurt Me,"
sometimes illuminatingly so, but other times stumbling on the fine
line between sincere and cynical.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, the three songs from that album that he included in the
brief performance fell mostly on the sincere side, thanks in part to
the directness of his presentation (solo acoustic guitar with a
little low-key electric guitar support from Tim Easton) and
relatively outgoing attitude. Anne Murray's 1970 hit "Snowbird" was
played for melancholy, not sentimentality. Phil Ochs' resigned
"Rehearsal for Retirement" sounds like a song Eitzel was born to
sing. And though he gave a little lounge-y body English to Kris
Kristofferson's "Help Me Make It Through the Night," it still seemed
an earnest plea.</TE>
<TE>   Two new songs, though, showed new directions for his substantial
writing talents, both starting as frivolous stream of consciousness
exercises but slyly settling into arresting social criticism. One
used the image of a male stripper as an analogy for superficial
patriotism, the other sort of updated Simon &amp; Garfunkel's "At the
Zoo," evaluating members of the animal kingdom by putative musical
tastes. Of course, he never said if any critters like his music.</TE>

<LD>Stacy Peralta and Tony Alva are standing on the sand not far from the
Santa Monica Pier, watching white-tipped waves rush toward the shore.
Two of the most well-known figures in the world of skateboarding,
Peralta and Alva have returned to their boyhood stomping grounds to
discuss Peralta's upcoming documentary, "Dogtown and Z Boys," an
intensely personal exploration of their involvement with the Zephyr
skate team. A ragtag group of local surfers who took their renegade
style from the surf to the streets, the Zephyr team (Alva, Peralta,
Jay Adams, Peggy Oki and other skating innovators ) kicked sand in
the face of conventional skateboarding and changed the sport forever.</LD>
<LD>   "This was our spot," Tony says, pointing out into the blue. "The
wind would be offshore in the morning, and if it was a good day it
would be great surf all along the beach, but usually--"</LD>
<LD>   "Usually the good surf was in front of the sewer pipe, which let
out right there," interjects Peralta, laughing. "It was a dump back
then. But all that's changed."</LD>
<TE>   "Yeah," snorts Alva, "They didn't have limousine parking back
then."</TE>
<TE>   Alva has a point. In the early 1970s, when the area was known
locally as Dogtown, these few blocks wedged between Venice and
downtown Santa Monica were a relative wasteland, a beach slum
occupied by a rehab center, a sanatorium, a liquor store and the
skeletal remains of Pacific Ocean Park, its rides and coasters half
submerged in green water. It was here that the local surf crew--young
kids, many from working-class and single-parent homes--would meet in
the early morning to swap stories, cadge cigarettes and ride their
boards between the splintered ribs of Pacific Ocean Park.</TE>
<TE>   "It was filthy. It was dirty. It was paradise," Peralta says.</TE>
<TE>   Reputation as Motley Crew of Outsiders</TE>
<TE>   Alva and Peralta were part of a motley crew of surfers who had
established a reputation as outlaw outsiders, the antithesis of the
bronzed blond beach boys of the 1960s. The Dogtown crew came in all
colors and sizes, and they surfed with a flashy, sometimes foolhardy
style. The epicenter of their world was the Zephyr surf shop, a few
blocks off the beach, which served as a kind of makeshift clubhouse.
Owners Jeff Ho, Skip Engblom and Craig Stecyk provided the locals
with custom boards, fatherly wisdom and sanctuary. Anxious to keep
the boys occupied when the surf was down, the Zephyr staff introduced
them to surfing's land cousin, the skateboard.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have the support that a lot of kids have today. There
were no soccer moms in skateboarding," Peralta says, laughing. "It's
not that our parents didn't like what we did, it's just that they
didn't have a precedent to understand it.... The only support we had
was the Zephyr shop and each other."</TE>
<TE>   Encouraged by their Zephyr mentors, the Dogtown kids began to
spend more time on concrete and less in the water, until they had
acquired enough skill to form a competitive team, eventually debuting
at the 1975 Del Mar Nationals, skateboarding's biggest event.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first time we ever saw skateboarders outside of our
town," recalls Peralta. "We were like a gang when we showed up. We
all skateboarded the same and we had a very distinct style."</TE>
<TE>   Embracing their new pastime with the same renegade attitude they
had displayed on the waves, the Dogtown skaters honed an aesthetic
that would immediately distinguish them from their competitors. Their
showing at the Nationals soon catapulted the crew to unexpected fame.
Their dynamic personalities and daring, high-flying, vertical style
revitalized the sport, kicking off a skateboarding craze that is
still thriving.</TE>
<TE>   "People sometimes ask, 'Did you know what you were doing back
then? Did you know that it was significant?' And I say, 'No, how
could we?'" says Peralta.</TE>
<TE>   "But we grabbed it while we could," Alva says. "We could skate
everything; freestyle, slalom, downhill, cross-country, whatever,
bring it on! Once we started getting famous, we were almost like rock
stars, but all we wanted to do was to be accepted by the other kids
on the team."</TE>
<TE>   'Adamant About Breaking the Rules Cinematically'</TE>
<TE>   The Z-Boys' rise was captured with a slew of Super-8 and
16-millimeter cameras, as well as by Zephyr owner Stecyk, who
documented the group's evolution in Skateboarder magazine. These
vibrant images form the backbone of Peralta's high-energy film, a
frenetic, glossy, cut-and-paste experiment that is as much an
exploration of skating history as a stylistic homage.</TE>
<TE>   "I was adamant about breaking the rules cinematically," says
Peralta, who incorporated music, digitally shot interviews and found
film footage into the documentary. "We wanted this thing to be as
real as possible, with warts and all. We wanted to do everything we
never would be allowed to do. I learned how to be a filmmaker making
skateboarding videos, and because I worked for myself, I had no one
on top of me telling what to do. As a result, I did a lot of the
wrong things, which ended up leading, in some ways, down the right
path."</TE>
<TE>   As producer and director of the "Bones Brigade" skate videos,
Peralta had established himself as a successful director, but
documenting his past was the last thing on his mind, until he
discovered that Hollywood was intent on fictionalizing it.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a successful Spin magazine article on Dogtown, and
Hollywood was considering making a fictional narrative about us,"
Peralta says. "I thought it was imperative that we get a chance to
tell our own story. We felt like it needed to be protected, that we
needed ... a chance to express ourselves about this time in our
life."</TE>
<TE>   Narrated by Sean Penn, the documentary is more then a Z-Boys
chronicle. It captures not only the freedom and grace of the skaters,
but creates a portrait of skateboarding as a complex, challenging and
imaginative sport, as valid as football, baseball or basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "What we wanted to show was that skateboarding can give kids
creativity and an outlet to express themselves." Explains Peralta,
"This is an urban sport in a lot of ways. Kids don't have access to
parks or fields, but they have access to cement. The skateboarder
sees that concrete as something that they can create out of and they
make something beautiful. It's unique in how creative a sport it is
and how it mixes with art and music in a way other sports don't.
Skateboarders are multitalented. They're artists, photographers and
[from] every walk of life. It opens a certain freedom in a person."</TE>
<TE>   "It's because there are no rules," continues Alva. "There's not a
lot of gear and it's democratic, in that the best and the worst can
skate the same session. That doesn't happen in football. There's no
winner or loser, the guy that's out there having the most fun is the
best rider. The whole point is creativity and style, not strength.
The concrete is a canvas, and it's like art and it's like dancing."</TE>
<TE>   'The Greatest, Purest Time in Our Lives'</TE>
<TE>   Perusing their old haunts, Peralta and Alva seem more than
thankful for the experience, and the people and the places that
formed the foundation of their unexpected success. "There's something
about this place" says Peralta, smiling out at the Pacific, "and
about that time. I think Tony would agree that it was the greatest,
purest time in our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Alva smiles a little wistfully. "I think the movie shows how
special it was, what it was like here. It will give kids a taste of
the history, of skateboarding and of this place." He pauses and takes
in the view, the expensive hotels, the restaurants, the limo parking
and the clean white stretch of beach.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's important, because it will never, ever be like that
again."</TE>

<LD>   "J for J"--"Take care of him" or "Watch out for her," a parent
says to a child, and with those words, a brother or sister goes from
being a mere annoyance to a daunting responsibility. This obligation
has fallen heavily on actress, director and now writer Jenny
Sullivan, who, since girlhood, has been looking out for a
developmentally disabled older brother, played here by John Ritter.
Pondering their relationship in her autobiographical show, she
considers how duty has tied her in knots through the years yet bound
her more closely to her brother as well as to her parents.</LD>
<LD>   Sullivan--perhaps best known for directing the premiere of Jane
Anderson's "The Baby Dance"--returns to acting with a performance
that vibrates with vulnerability and need. In a dignified, wholly
convincing performance, Ritter confirms the gift for sharp
characterization that he demonstrated as the friend and father figure
in the movie "Sling Blade."</LD>

<LD>* New this week: In its first two-thirds, "My First Mister," which
marks Christine Lahti's feature directorial debut, looks to be a
winner. But it takes a disastrously wrong turn toward the end that
all but destroys the good work that's come before. Until that point,
it's a beguiling and amusing tale of Jennifer, a cynical 17-year-old
Goth girl (Leelee Sobieski) and Randall, a conservative 49-year-old
clothing merchant (Albert Brooks), who discover that such apparent
total opposites are much alike. Before Jennifer and Randall have a
chance to discover whether their deepening emotional bond is that of
a father and a daughter or of a romantic nature, screenwriter Jill
Franklyn pulls out one of the movies' hoariest devices, a dark
development that turns the film into a shameless, contrived and
manipulative heart-tugger. With Desmond Harrington, Carol Kane, Mary
Kay Place, Michael McKean and John Goodman.</LD>

<DH>Two series showcase Swedish director Mauritz Stiller and
France's New Wave.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The UCLA Film Archive 13 years ago presented a series of classic
Swedish films that illustrated the talent of major pioneer director
Mauritz Stiller. He was known primarily as the discoverer of Greta
Garbo, whom Stiller accompanied to Hollywood; in contrast to her
spectacular success, he met failure. Now the archive offers a more
comprehensive view of the director with "The Golden Age of Mauritz
Stiller," which opens Saturday at 7 p.m. in Melnitz Hall's James
Bridges Theater with the 1916 comedy "Love and Journalism," which
will be followed by the better-known 40-minute film "The Wings."</LD>
<LD>   A scholarly dispute continues over whether this subtle and
sophisticated 1916 film invokes the legend of Ganymede or Icarus. The
first interpretation would imply a gay theme--and Stiller was
gay--the second, a straight one. It is not hard to see homosexual
implications in this recently rediscovered film.</LD>
<LD>   Based on a novel by Herman Bang, it is a love triangle involving a
famed elderly artist (Egil Eide), his young model, Eugene Mikael
(Lars Hanson) and a frivolous aristocrat (Lili Bech), who captivates
Mikael, much to the anguish of the artist. It will be followed by the
1917 comedy "Thomas Graal's Best Film," starring actor-director
Victor Sjostrom of Ingmar Bergman's "Wild Strawberries."</LD>
<TE>   "Sir Arne's Treasure" (Sunday at 7 p.m.) is Stiller's masterpiece,
a stirring and visually splendid 1919 epic tale of death, revenge and
ill-fated love set in the 16th century and based on a story by Selma
Lagerlof. The luminous Mary Johnson plays a young woman tormented by
a love for the man (Richard Lund) who has slain her family and stolen
its treasure. The film possesses a psychological complexity unusual
for its time, and has some spectacularly stark sequences set on a
frozen sea. It is remarkable that Stiller, a man so at home in
drawing rooms and boudoirs, would also have such a strong feeling for
nature. This is followed by "Johan" (1921).</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., "Gunnar Hede's Saga" is another
much-praised Lagerlof adaptation. It will be followed by "The Song of
the Scarlet Flower" (1919), based on a popular--and very
Victorian--tale about the redemption of a farmer's son (Lars Hanson)
cast out when he's caught in a compromising situation with a
housemaid in spite of the fact that nothing actually had happened. It
has a remarkable sequence in which Hanson balances on a log as it
proceeds down a river to treacherous rapids. In theme and in this
sequence, this film anticipates D.W. Griffith's "Way Down East," made
the following year. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   A "50th Anniversary Tribute to Cahiers du Cinema," arguably the
most influential film journal, which gave birth to France's New Wave,
commences Friday at 7:30 p.m. at LACMA with "Breathless," which is as
fresh as it was when it was first released in 1959. Jean-Luc Godard's
restless, shoot-from-the hip style hasn't become dated one iota, but
because we're more familiar with it, it's easier now to appreciate
the extraordinary talent of Belmondo and Jean Seberg, who seem to be
living their roles.</TE>
<TE>   Belmondo, whose crook has a terrific sense of style, is enormously
attractive to women and knows it. Belmondo and Seberg emerged as
screen icons in this landmark film, whose place in the history of
world cinema is secure.</TE>
<TE>   It will be followed by Jean-Pierre Melville's 1962 "Le Doulos"
("The Fingerman"), starring Belmondo. In its opening sequence we
watch a man approach a handsome but shabby 19th century townhouse in
the deserted outskirts of Paris. A train rushes nearby; there is weak
light from ancient street fixtures. The man enters the building and
proceeds to the attic, where a fence is disassembling some jewelry in
front of an oval window.</TE>
<TE>   Very shortly, the visitor (Serge Reggiani) guns down the fence,
steals his loot and buries it by one of the lampposts. Melville
accomplishes all of this with such economy and easy bravura that the
effect is exhilarating. Once Melville swiftly moves past the robbery,
he plunges us into a dizzyingly intricate thicket of betrayals. "The
Golden Coach" (1952), Saturday at 7:30 p.m., is one of Jean Renoir's
most exquisite films, an adaptation of the Prosper Merimee play
filmed in Italy and starring Anna Magnani in one of her finest
performances. Magnani is Camilla, or La Perichole, the tempestuous
star of a hardy commedia dell'arte troupe that has endured a
five-month sea voyage to Peru in the early 18th century in hope of
bettering its fortunes in the New World.</TE>
<TE>   Earthy yet eloquent, Camilla is a breath of fresh air in the
staid, indolent court of the Viceroy (Duncan Lamont), one of her
three suitors and a man intent on oppressing the natives at all
costs, even bankruptcy. However, just when "The Golden Coach" seems
little more than a light romantic comedy and a feast for the eyes
with its period settings and costumes in ravishing color, its
perspectives broaden and it achieves the impact of the classic
Renoirs, "Grand Illusion" and "The Rules of the Game."</TE>
<TE>   Francois Truffaut's "Day for Night," which celebrates the perils
and joys of filmmaking as "The Golden Coach" does for the world of
theater, follows, with star Jacqueline Bisset scheduled to appear.
(323) 857-6010.</TE>
<TE>   The Laemmle Theaters' outstanding Documentary Days 2002 series'
final selection is Doug Wolens' comprehensive and provocative
"Butterfly," which takes its title from the forest name of then
21-year-old Julia Hill, who climbed 180 feet to a 6-foot-by-8-foot
platform constructed in a 1,000-year-old redwood tree in a Humboldt
County forest. She went up Dec. 10, 1997, and didn't climb down for
two years. Her idea was to protest the reckless and sometimes illegal
logging practices of Pacific Lumber Co., which in 1985 was subject to
a hostile takeover by Texas corporate raider Charles Hurwitz.</TE>
<TE>   By preparing to risk her life to save a single ancient tree, Hill
succeeded in calling attention to the evils of clear-cut lumbering,
which lays waste to huge stretches of forest wilderness,
destabilizing steep hillsides, destroying watershed and causing
floods. Another reckless practice is the use of herbicides to kill
off hardwood deemed inferior, thus polluting drinking water supplies
and killing salmon.</TE>
<TE>   The point of Hill and her key support group, Earth First, is not
to stop logging, but to end current "cut-and-run" tactics of Pacific
Lumber and return it and other companies to the more responsible,
environment-friendly policies of the past. Hill worked from a
spiritual basis, but her personal approach did allow her sometimes
critical supporters to get the environmental message out. Hill
emerges as a lovely, radiant, articulate young woman.</TE>
<TE>   What is dismaying is that opponents see her and her supporters
only as hippie-like, New Age kooks who are costing loggers their
jobs--and, alas, Hill and the Earth Firsters do carry on at times in
ways that reinforce this negative image. But their enemies either
cannot or will not see the urgent larger picture these dedicated
young people are striving to get across. Also dismaying is the
ineffectual policies of the California Department of Forestry in
curbing men such as Hurwitz, who upon taking over Pacific Lumber
announced that "he who has the gold, rules."</TE>
<TE>   "Butterfly" is an engaging consciousness-raiser and proof that an
individual can make a difference. "Butterfly" screens at 11 a.m. May
4-5 at the Monica 4-Plex, Santa Monica, (310) 394-9741; May 11-12 at
the Playhouse 7, Pasadena, (626) 844-6500; and May 25-27 at the Lido,
Newport Beach, (949) 673-8351.</TE>
<TE>   "The Attic Expeditions," which began Friday and Saturday midnight
screenings at the Sunset 5 in West Hollywood last weekend, is an
amusing and ambitious supernatural horror picture in which a young
man, Trevor (Andras Jones), kills his bride in self-defense when she
attempts to make him the victim of a sacrificial ritual as
doubtlessly outlined in an ancient text of black magic in her
possession.</TE>
<TE>   Confined to an institution for the criminally insane, Trevor faces
fresh horrors from its head doctor (Jeffrey Combs), who seemingly
believes that humanity could be cured of all mental ills if black
magic and science were one. The doctor believes he's on the brink of
a breakthrough--but needs to get his hands on that text.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the film takes place in a halfway house, a
turn-of-the-last-century Georgian Revival mansion decorated in
Mondrian-inspired color schemes and designs and in retro '50s and
'60s decor. Here's where Trevor ends up--and where he begins his
expeditions into the mysteries of its attic.</TE>
<TE>   Director Jeremy Kasten and writer Rogan Russell Marshall are
consistently imaginative and audacious, willing to challenge as well
as entertain their audience. Along with a capable cast, they've
received a terrific assist from production designer Laura Roberts and
her team and from cinematographers Michael Negrin and Greg
Littlewood, whose use of light and sensitivity to Roberts' vibrant
color scheme create the film's crucial sense of transporting the
viewer into a nightmare world. "The Attic Expeditions" is a
low-budget gem. (323) 848-3500.</TE>

<HD>Musical to Strike Up a Band Without Union Members</HD>
<DH>Labor* Touring 'Music Man' production, also using
non-Equity actors, has been beset by protests.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a touring production of "The Music Man" opens Tuesday at Orange
County Performing Arts Center, the music men and women in the
orchestra pit won't be union musicians. So members of American
Federation of Musicians Local 7 plan to stand outside the theater,
distributing leaflets in protest.</LD>
<LD>   The 38 actors in the show aren't union members, either. Actors'
Equity, the union for professional stage actors, is not planning to
demonstrate outside the theater--even though 12 of the previous
opening nights for this tour were beset by Equity protesters.</LD>
<LD>   Whether the union status of the performers matters to the audience
is in dispute. The unions say their members--generally more seasoned
performers--would make a qualitative difference to audiences. The
producer disagrees.</LD>
<TE>   But this particular production matters to the unions because it is
the first national tour of the recent Broadway revival of "The Music
Man." First national tours of Broadway productions, as opposed to
some of the subsequent tours, traditionally operate with union
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Although Equity plans no demonstration in Costa Mesa, Equity
officials estimated that their protest on the opening night of the
Chicago engagement for the tour last month attracted 500
demonstrators. The tour's producer, Dan Sher, acknowledged that there
were "a lot of people." The tour is making money, he said, but he
believes the attention drawn to the union issues by the media--more
than the protests themselves--have slowed business at the box office
during the day or two prior to each city's opening night.</TE>
<TE>   Equity officials decided to forgo a protest in Costa Mesa after
meeting with members of the cast in an attempt to persuade them to
sign cards requesting a National Labor Relations Board vote on union
representation.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an indication we might be able to organize this cast,"
John Holly, Equity's western regional director, said last week. "We
don't want to do anything that might tip the scales against us."</TE>
<TE>   Although Holly declined to be specific about the progress of that
campaign, he said Tuesday that "we are very positive that we can
achieve something with this cast."</TE>
<TE>   Sher declined to specify how much he pays his talent, though he
said that the cast receives "a very wide range" of salaries, from
about $25,000 to "six figures" on an annual basis. But he doesn't
dispute reports that he generally pays his talent about half as much
as union members would receive according to contractual minimums,
which are $1,285 a week for the actors and $1,400 for the musicians.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the economic issues, the unions also have a history of
objecting to non-union productions that are presented within the
"Broadway" series on the grounds of protecting theatergoers from
misleading marketing. For example, the Orange County series that
includes "The Music Man" is called the "Bank of America Broadway
Series," although its performers wouldn't be able to work on Broadway
unless they joined the unions.</TE>
<TE>   However, tickets for "The Music Man" cost $20 to $55--less than
those for any other production in the series and considerably less
than Broadway tickets. The price reflects the fact that the $225,000
paid by the center to the producer is about half the fee charged by a
typical unionized show. So the unions aren't emphasizing that
argument this time around.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Productions, which mounted the Broadway "Music Man,"
decided that a unionized tour of that production would be too costly
for presenters and too financially risky for producers, said Michael
David, one of the Dodger partners. "With much disappointment, [we]
reluctantly released the touring rights back to the estate of
Meredith Willson"--the show's creator.</TE>
<TE>   Sher's Big League Theatricals, also based in New York, then
acquired the rights. Big League has produced at least 20 shows over
13 years, without using Equity contracts, Sher said. He saw no reason
to break with that policy. Sher said his "The Music Man" uses union
stagehands and a director and choreographer who are union members.
"If a contract feels affordable in the future" with the left-out
unions, he said, "it's not out of the question."</TE>
<TE>   If Equity succeeds in organizing Sher's current cast, the future
may arrive sooner than Sher expects. Although Sher said that "there
would be a long legal process with both sides," he also said the tour
is now booked through May 2003, leaving more than a year in which to
reach some agreement.</TE>
<TE>   One change on behalf of the touring talent was already made. As of
Jan. 1, they've received health benefits, which weren't part of their
original contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Amoss, president of Musicians Local 7, is not impressed. He
referred to the producer as "minor league, not big league."</TE>

<LD>Wouldn't it be fun if sitcom stunt casting meant that the celebrity
guests actually performed stunts, like on the old "Circus of the
Stars"?</LD>
<LD>   Well, maybe they do. Watching Michael Douglas' guest appearance on
tonight's "Will &amp; Grace" (9 p.m., NBC) is sort of like witnessing a
clown act performed on the high wire. He's a bit stiff in this comic
turn, but he attacks it gamely, and his earnest goofiness wins out in
the end.</LD>
<LD>   The episode--written by Jenji Kohan, directed by James Burrows and
titled "Fagel Attraction"--casts Douglas as a police detective who
investigates the theft of a laptop computer belonging to Eric
McCormack's Will. Playing off of his old "Streets of San Francisco"
character, Douglas is no-nonsense on the surface, but his secret
attraction to Will leads to a decidedly unorthodox stakeout.</LD>
<TE>   The scene that will be the subject of Friday's water-cooler
conversations: a slow dance that puts McCormack in Douglas' arms,
uttering a line that is pure Mae West.</TE>
<TE>   It's this under-the-radar naughtiness that makes "Will &amp; Grace" so
slyly subversive week after week--and helps to whisk away the bad
taste left by the one-note stereotypes foisted upon supporting
players Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally.</TE>

<HD>To Mom, It Was Trouble; To Mudpeople, It's More</HD>
<DH>'Living sculptures' are taking their smear campaign, or
'walkabouts,' to the L.A. River.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mud--it's not just for spa treatments anymore. Or, for that matter,
for throwing pots, building bricks or making kiddie playing pies. The
soft, damp earth transforms Mike Mollett and his band of Angelenos
into a tribe of urban primitives, the L.A. Mudpeople.</LD>
<LD>   Even by quirky Los Angeles standards, the Mudpeople are in a class
by themselves. Dressed only in loincloths, strategically placed
leaves and giant head-covering masks, they smear their bodies with
mud and walk--slowly, deliberately--around their surroundings.</LD>
<LD>   "Essentially, we're living sculptures," explains Mollett, who
founded the group 13 years ago. "We're an antidote to speed, stress,
goals and time in this urbanizing society. As Mudpeople, we do not
speak, so people must come up with their own answers as to who we are
and why we're there, which may also put them in a position to wonder
about themselves, and why they're moving so quickly."</LD>
<TE>   Angelenos might encounter the Mudpeople again this weekend at the
Los Angeles River. As part of the Arroyo Arts Collective exhibitions
this weekend, six upstanding citizens once again will shed their
clothes and "mud up" to explore the river basin.</TE>
<TE>   Mollett--a poet, teacher and performance artist--decided to try
his hand with the glop in 1989, after being inspired by pictures of
Colorado mudpeople. He booked himself and a few others at a
now-defunct reggae club as a one-off entertainment. The group donned
plaster of Paris mudheads, slathered their nearly naked bodies with
mud, and walked around checking out their environment. Mollett got
hooked on the ritual--not to mention the liberating effects of
near-nudity masked by mud--and became the de facto leader of the
tribe.</TE>
<TE>   "As a mudperson," he says, "you need to be able to just hang out,
observe the environment and what's going on inside yourself. It's
somewhat of a spiritual process, so you need to let go--of goals, of
directions and of needs, I suppose."</TE>
<TE>   In ordinary civilian life, the lanky 50-something Mollett dresses
normally--in jeans or khakis and funky tees--and works as a
substitute teacher for preschool through fifth grade. He's witty and
articulate, fitting for one who has been part of the poetry
performance scene for nearly two decades.</TE>
<TE>   'We Use All Kinds of Mud'</TE>
<TE>   The ranks of the L.A. Mudpeople have ballooned to up to 40 over
the years, and they've participated in more than 50 events, including
the Doo Dah Parade, the International Festival of Masks and the World
Festival of Sacred Music. They've journeyed to Joshua Tree National
Monument and Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   The Mudpeople also schedule their own "walkabouts," which in the
past have explored the Bunker Hill steps downtown, Melrose Avenue and
Old Town Pasadena. (In one of its earliest incarnations, actor
Leonardo DiCaprio, then about 15, took to the streets of Venice in a
handmade mud head.)</TE>
<TE>   For these walkabouts, or any performance, the Mudpeople get to the
location first--it keeps their cars cleaner that way--and then strip
down and "mud up."</TE>
<TE>   "We use all kinds of mud. We get mud from Silver Lake, there's
Hollywood mud and mud from the Gold Rush part of the state. Then
there's the commercial mud--from the art store--potter's clay. That
is purchased and that's what we use the most. I ask people who get
around to bring me mud, but I love L.A. mud. It's the darkest--a dark
umber, black, really--and it's great."</TE>
<TE>   Mollett says that he prepares the mud ahead of time, about an hour
before trundling off to an event. "We use half a dozen different
colors each time. We've gotten rather sophisticated. Some of us are
artists, and we love colorful mud; we love texture."</TE>
<TE>   And what a texture it is. Mollett likens the mud to pudding.
"Chocolate, caramel or butterscotch pudding," he points out. "One
color we use as a base and then start slapping, applying, slathering.
It's the thickness of an ointment."</TE>
<TE>   Mollett's cohorts in the upcoming outing include four other
men--Tom Erickson, Danny Serfaty, John Forker and Helen Van der Neer
(a waiter at Canter's, an accountant, a musician and a transvestite
massage therapist, respectively). Then there is the lone, albeit
valiant woman, Lorraine Perrotta. Perrotta, an acquisitions librarian
at the Huntington Library, has been a mudperson since 1992 and has
participated in most of the group's excursions.</TE>
<TE>   "I do it because it's a way to experience the world in a
completely different way," she says. "It's a way to be transformed."</TE>
<TE>   Further validating their status as urban anthropological wonders,
the Mudpeople have been featured in National Geographic magazine.
Huell Howser of PBS' "Visiting" featured them on his show in 1996. He
continues airing the episode several times a year, because, he says,
it has evoked the most response.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of my favorite programs because it challenges our
viewers to come to their own conclusions," Howser says. "It stretches
their imaginations rather than handing it to them on a plate. When
the Mudpeople go out and do this street theater, it's doing us all a
great service, because they hold a mirror up to ourselves and show us
very clearly how we deal with each other, or how we deal with people
who are different than we are. It almost forces us to either ignore
them or deal with them. It's a wonderful human exercise."</TE>
<TE>   Mollett sums it up this way: "Anything and everything can be
beautiful or interesting and be worth something--the simplest thing,
such as a leaf, a wet fingerprint on a brick, a piece of shiny paper
blowing in the wind. They're all great; they're all poetic."</TE>

<HD>'Bob Le Flambeur': Illuminating Noir</HD>
<DH>Jean-Pierre Melville's 1956 masterpiece is among several
new foreign-language releases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several new DVDs and videos have a distinct international flavor,
showcasing films from France, Russia and even Iceland.</LD>
<LD>   New on DVD from Criterion is French director Jean-Pierre
Melville's 1956 masterpiece "Bob Le Flambeur" ($30). This influential
black-and-white film noir revolves around an aging gangster who
spends most of his life in Paris gambling houses. Though he's been on
the straight and narrow for several years, Bob plots one last caper:
to rob the casino at Deauville.</LD>
<LD>   Melville brilliantly captures the nightlife and seedy world of the
Parisian underworld. And his film is a precursor to the French New
Wave films of the late 1950s and early '60s in terms of its
innovative story structure, bold camera work and quick cutting. No
wonder Melville was a hero to such New Wavers as Jean-Luc Godard and
Francois Truffaut.</LD>
<TE>   The digital edition features a gorgeous new digital transfer of
the restored film with a new English subtitle translation. There is
also a trailer, a stills gallery, a radio interview with Melville
from the early '60s--he died at age 56 in 1973--and an engaging video
interview with Daniel Cauchy, who played the role of Paulo in the
film.</TE>
<TE>   Cauchy discusses the fact that Melville had little money to make
"Bob," so filming stretched over 18 months. Whenever he got enough
money to film for a day or two, he'd call his cast together until the
money ran out. Cauchy made three other films during the production of
"Bob."</TE>
<TE>   Also new from France is the fluffy comedy "Happenstance" (New
Yorker, $70 for VHS; $30 for DVD). Directed by Laurent Firode, the
film follows six strangers whose lives change because of chance
encounters with each other during one magical day. Audrey Tautou, the
charming, gamine star of "Amelie," heads the strong ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   From Russia comes the lovely 1992 drama "We Are Going to America"
(Facts, $30 for VHS). Directed by Efrim Gribov, the movie is adapted
from a Sholom Aleichem story and inspired visually by the paintings
of Marc Chagall. It focuses on one Russian Jewish family's search for
the American dream, as seen through the wide eyes of an 11-year-old
boy.</TE>
<TE>   Iceland is the setting for "The Juniper Tree" (Rhino, $20 for
DVD), a rather grim tale based on a Grimm fairy tale. Written and
directed by Nietzchka Keene, the 1990 drama stars the popular
Icelandic pop singer Bjork in her first film. Then 19, she plays a
young girl who, with her older sister, flees across Iceland after
their mother is burned at the stake for being a witch. Her sister
casts a spell upon a widowed farmer so that he will fall in love with
her and marry her. But his young son sees what his stepmother is up
to and begs his father to stop the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   The black-and-white film is visually stunning and Bjork is quite
good, but it's pretty tough going. The digital edition includes an
interview with Keene, deleted scenes with commentary and a stills
gallery.</TE>
<TE>   One of TV's groundbreaking comedy series, "All in the Family," is
based on an equally popular British sitcom, "Till Death Do Us Part."
BFS has released several episodes of the Britcom on VHS ($35 for a
three-video set; $10 for a single video) and DVD ($40 for the set;
$18 each). The series, which began in 1966 and continued through the
mid-'70s, stars Warren Mitchell as the outspoken, bigoted,
working-class Alf Garrett; Dandy Nichols is his long-suffering wife,
Else; Una Stubbs plays his daughter, Rita, and Anthony Booth is his
lazy, unemployed son-in-law, Mike. The cast is great and there are
laughs, but "Till Death Do Us Part" is far meaner in spirit than "All
in the Family" ever was.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shot primarily in Slovakia and Bratislava, "Behind Enemy Lines"
(Fox, $28) is an old-fashioned but entertaining war adventure set in
Bosnia in 1993, starring Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson. The
serviceable digital edition includes a nice wide-screen version of
the film, an average behind-the-scenes featurette, three extended
scenes--including the original main title and end-credit
sequences--and informative commentary from John Moore, a commercial
director making his feature debut, and editor Martin Smith. Another
commentary track features producers John Davis and Wick Godfrey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The "Official NBC 2002 Olympic Games Highlight Video/DVD" (NBC,
$15 for VHS; $20 for DVD) offers the opportunity to relieve the
thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. Culled from 375 hours of
NBC, MSNBC and CNBC coverage and narrated by Bob Costas, the
compilation program revisits such magical moments from the 35th
annual Winter Olympic games as Sarah Hughes' gold-medal performance
in figure skating and Jim Shea capturing the gold in his skeleton
run.</TE>
<TE>   The downside is that these are highlights of the various events.
Those looking for more complete coverage will be disappointed. At
least the DVD includes 45 minutes of additional footage, including
Bode Miller's downhill runs and Jill Bakken and Vonetta Flowers' run
for the gold in the bobsled.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The world's greatest superheroes--Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,
the Flash, the Green Lantern, Hawkgirl and Martian Manhunter--team up
to fight the bad guys in "Justice League," a vastly enjoyable
animated adventure (Warner, $15 for VHS; $20 for DVD). "Justice
League" is one of the most popular series on the Cartoon Network and
for good reason--it's fun, funny and handsomely animated. The DVD
includes character and talent bios.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even Steve Martin, Helena Bonham Carter and Laura Dern can't
breathe life into the labored dark comedy "Novocaine" (Artisan, $25),
about a dentist and the two very weird women in his life.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition includes a ho-hum documentary on the making of
the film. Much more entertaining is the mini-doc called "Bitten,"
about forensic dentists.</TE>
<TE>   Writer-director David Atkins supplies the commentary. Atkins,
whose father and two brothers are dentists, actually worked
undercover in a dentist's office to research the film.</TE>
<TE>--- UNPUBLISHED NOTE ---</TE>
<TE>"All in the Family" was based on the British series, "Till Death Us Do
Part," (the correct name) not on a series called "Till Death Do Us Part."</TE>

<HD>'Snow White' Tells a Merry Tale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Snow White" is fairy-tale light in the Falcon Theatre's cozily
familiar production. It's the kind of breezy comic diversion that had
been the theater's most usual children's fare until its most recent
season, featuring the anarchic Troubadour Players' circus madness,
"Funky Punks With Junk in Their Trunks," and avant-garde French duo
Blue Palm's poetic theater-dance piece, "Childhood."</LD>
<LD>   That's not to say, however, that this professionally staged "Snow
White," though formulaic, isn't entertaining. Written by Thorin
Alexander, and executed with a thankfully light touch by director
Hope Alexander, it is more evenly constructed than some of its
predecessors. The resulting romp clips merrily along, narrated in
song by composer John C. Brown--guitar in hand and wearing fairy tale
garb--and performed by a solid adult cast led by irresistible Lenore
Thomas as a sweet but not sugary Snow White.</LD>
<LD>   Wesley Horton hits the right note of tongue-in-cheek brashness as
Snow White's handsome admirer, Leon the Huntsman-turned-lifeguard,
and Richard Wylie's comic energy as M.D.--a full-sized substitute for
the Seven Dwarfs--adds bounce.</LD>
<TE>   Melanie Ewbanks, meanwhile, is fun as the over-the-top wicked
queen, who dons Groucho glasses as her disguise and who must not only
contend with her stepdaughter's beauty, but with her talking mirror's
(Wylie) lukewarm support: "Looking glass on the wall, who's the
fairest of them all?</TE>
<TE>   "You're a close second. Is that so bad?"</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary references--cell phones, Twinkies, lifeguards and
Bob's Big Boy--figure into the mix to win quick laughs from children
and adults. But the production brings the story to life too, enough
so that younger audience members are soon shouting out choruses of
advice and warnings to help Snow White reach her happy ending.</TE>
<TE>   When she's about to take a bite of the apple: "No, it's poison!"</TE>
<TE>   When M.D. suggests that he fetch the queen to help: "No! She's the
one that did it!" and "Get the Huntsman!"</TE>
<TE>   The audience can clap along with some musical raps too (Valerie
Herkert did the light choreography), one child is recruited to tell
Leon what has happened, and the entire audience helps save Snow White
by blowing kisses her way.</TE>
<TE>   The simple but colorful set by Joe Ferrulli earns approval for its
surprise fold-out cottage interior; costume designer Amanda Lewis'
sparkly white satin dress for Snow White is a crowd-pleaser too, and
Nick McCord adds a bit of depth with a pretty lighting design that
includes lengths of leafy silhouettes and lightning.</TE>

<HD>Campus Art Center Bustling</HD>
<DH>University is still in the works, but Camarillo gallery is
busy with shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The idyllic property in Camarillo that was for decades the state
hospital has been in a state of suspended animation and transition,
gearing up for its opening as the newest campus of the Cal State
University system. But one corner of the compound has been notably
active for the last few years.</LD>
<LD>   At the moment, the expansive gallery and studio space known as
Studio Channel Islands Art Center is hosting three distinct
exhibitions, a feat normally reserved for museums. In the back
gallery, usually the site of group shows by resident artists, a
sibling exhibition by former Ojai residents Kate and Arthur Hughes
highlights a pleasant landscape-loving collection of batik works,
paintings and photographs.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the hallways are given over to a traveling exhibition
called "Liquid Art," sponsored by the Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California. A display of photographs documents mostly public
sculptural works around Los Angeles. Among the works pictured is
"Source Figure," one of Robert Graham's trademark statue-esque female
nude figures, this one an African American woman, atop a pillar in a
fountain.</LD>
<TE>   From a local angle, the show includes paintings of swimmers in
fluid motion by Camarillo resident Roxie Ray-Bordelon and a photo of
the rhythmic water-spouting fountain by the Ventura pier, by Ventura
sculptor Mark Lere.</TE>
<TE>   In SCIAC's main gallery is an eclectic group show of Asian
American artists. Curated by artist and Ventura College teacher
Hiroko Yoshimoto, the art is loosely gathered under the idealistic
title "Asian American Experience." Said experience, in this showing,
is a varied one, ranging from Seiko Tachibana's elegant scrolls
suspended from the gallery ceiling to K.T. Otama's "Monet's Garden,"
an impressionist painting refreshed by its view through the prism of
post-Modernist thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Yoshimoto's own contribution is a series of her incisive close-up
portraits, in profile, of Asian women. Scott Kattano's silk-screen
words--"panacea" and "Sayyes"--on gleaming plastic ovals reminds us
of Craig Kaufman's Pop Art lozenges, mixed with contemporary Japanese
pop aesthetics.</TE>
<TE>   Layered imagery appears prominently in work by more than one
artist here. Hei Myung Hyun's "Ancestral Garden" series presents a
background of varnished-over hieroglyphic text and flowery overlays
of acrylic paint, creating an appealing tension of foreground and
background sources. Ann Phong's "The Baskets" is a dreamy pictorial
scene with a barely discernible rougher, louder surface of goopy
abstraction. The suggestion is that of a pleasant, recessive memory
struggling for clarity.</TE>
<TE>   * "Asian American Experience," "Liquid Art" and art by Kate and
Arthur Hughes, Studio Channel Islands Art Center, Cal State Channel
Islands, Camarillo. Ends May 18. Gallery hours: Thursdays-Saturdays,
noon-3 p.m. (805) 383-1368.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mobile Jazz Series: Jazz is more a state of mind than a location,
so don't be confused by the two different locations of the two
Ventura Vanguard concerts this week. On Tuesday, the Vanguard series
will host a band led by saxists Paul Carman and Kim Richmond in its
original location, downstairs at the Laurel Theater. Tonight, veteran
saxist Gary Foster will appear as the operation moves to the Church
of Religious Science, a space that, unlike the Laurel or the Village
Vanguard namesake, is not in the basement jazz club tradition, but
has its sure ambient charms.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that the series is bringing worthwhile jazz
culture to Ventura, on what looks to be an ongoing basis.
Cumulatively, the pair of shows demonstrates the diversity of musical
energies in the Los Angeles jazz scene. Foster, whose band includes
solid pianist Tom Ranier, bassist Chuck Berghofer and drummer Kendall
Kay, holds down the mainstream jazz fort beautifully, while saxists
Carman and Richmond lean leftward toward the adventurous end of the
spectrum. They'll appear in their symmetrical Flying V group, with
twin bassists Chris Symer and Trey Henry, and percussionists Kay and
Brad Dutz. In all, a hardy week for jazz in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   * Ventura Vanguard Jazz Club concerts: Gary Foster today, Church
of Religious Science, 101 S. Laurel St., Ventura, 8 p.m.; Paul
Carman/Kim Richmond, Flying V, Tuesday, Laurel Theater, 1006 E. Main
St., Ventura, 8 p.m. Advance, $18; at the door, $20. (805) 644-9247.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grand Requiem: Verdi's Requiem is one of the most moving,
grand-scale works in his repertory, which makes this weekend's New
West Symphony program of special interest. They'll be performing the
classic in Oxnard and Thousand Oaks, with the additional choral
forces of both the Los Robles and Ventura master chorales, and a
stellar list of soloists: soprano Sharol Azrieli, mezzo-soprano Wendy
Hillhouse, tenor Francisco Casanova and bass Louis Legherz.</TE>
<TE>   * New West Symphony, Friday at Oxnard Performing Arts Center, 800
Hobson Way; Saturday at Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, 2100 E.

<HD>Vote Urges BofA Curb on Severance</HD>
<DH>Compensation: Measure seeking limit for execs is passed by
shareholders with 51% margin. Bank's board can reject request.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a vote echoing of investor anger over Enron Corp. and other
corporate debacles, shareholders of Bank of America Corp. on
Wednesday approved a resolution asking the company's board to limit
severance pay for executives.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, sponsored by the Teamsters pension plan and opposed
by BofA's management, passed at the banking giant's annual meeting by
a 51% margin--unprecedented for such proposals at large companies,
where shareholders typically accede to management's wishes.</LD>
<LD>   The resolution asks the bank's directors to require a shareholder
vote on any severance agreements worth more than twice an executive's
annual salary and bonus.</LD>
<TE>   The measure is only a request that the company's board could
reject or modify. "It's not a done deal," said Shirley Norton, a BofA
spokeswoman. "It will have to be considered by the compensation
committee and then the board."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, shareholder activists said the victory marks an
important milestone in their campaign to send a strong message to
corporate America about perceived abuses in corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   Unions, complaining that lofty bonuses for executives have
continued even as companies have fallen on hard times, have made
severance pay a major issue, sponsoring about 20 shareholder
initiatives similar to BofA's this year. The unions' pension funds
control billions of dollars in stock and thus are major shareholders
of many companies.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Investor Responsibility Research Center tracked 13
such severance pay measures, which won 32% of shareholder votes on
average.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been expecting the 'yes' votes to rise," said Carol Bowie,
head of corporate governance research at the center.</TE>
<TE>   BofA long has been a target for activists who say its board is
packed with cronies of management.</TE>
<TE>   Former President David A. Coulter, who headed the old BankAmerica
before it merged with NationsBank, received more than $30 million in
salary, bonuses and stock--plus a $5-million annual pension for
life--when he quit at age 51 shortly after the merger in 1998. A week
earlier, BofA took a $372-million write-down for losses on an
unsecured loan Coulter had engineered.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 41% of BofA shareholders voted for severance limits.
Most observers said the biggest factor leading to this year's
majority vote was Enron, which left thousands of workers jobless with
their retirement funds in worthless company stock while top managers
sold millions in stock before the energy company collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to escape the specter of Enron this year," said Patrick
McGurn at Institutional Shareholder Services, an advisory firm that
backed the BofA measure. He noted that about 47% of Citigroup Inc.
and Sprint Corp. shareholders voted for similar severance measures
recently.</TE>
<TE>   McGurn also pointed to shareholder protests that caused a policy
change this month at Mattel Inc., the toy maker that had sent off
former Chief Executive Jill Barad with a $50-million severance
package. Mattel pledged not to grant severance benefits that
"significantly exceed" those contained in employment contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Damon Silvers, associate general counsel at the AFL-CIO, said he
was "very surprised--but obviously pleased" with the BofA vote. He
said the bank's board should feel free to fine-tune the measure if,
as the company maintains, it will give directors too little
flexibility to hire top executives in a competitive market.</TE>
<TE>   BofA's Norton said she didn't have a timetable for board action.</TE>
<TE>   Graef Crystal, a compensation expert known for criticizing
excessive pay packages, said the BofA measure is "a noble effort to
constrain the outrageous security packages going to incompetent
buffoons." But he said it's flawed because it's likely to encourage
directors to award huge upfront bonuses or other perks to compensate
for severance limits.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one little rifle shot that may ricochet back at the guts
of the people who fired it," he said.</TE>

<LD>Skechers U.S.A. Inc. said Wednesday that first-quarter profit rose a
better-than-expected 19% as the shoemaker boosted sales and reduced
costs, and that earnings this year will be higher than forecast. The
company's shares gained 7.2%.</LD>
<LD>   Net income climbed to $20.3 million, or 53 cents a share, from
$17.1 million, or 45 cents, a year earlier, the maker of sneakers,
platform shoes and roller skates said. Sales rose 7.7% to $244.9
million from $227.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   Sales were helped by products such as Skechers 4 Wheelers roller
skates, the advertisements for which sometimes feature singer Britney
Spears.</LD>
<TE>   The company has reduced inventory, eliminated jobs, cut
advertising and closed its catalog business to lower costs, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Manhattan Beach-based company's shares rose $1.60 to $23.84 on
the New York Stock Exchange. It was their biggest percentage gain
since April 3, when Skechers said profit would be at least 25% more
than the 34-cent average analyst estimate. That translated into
profit of at least 42 cents. Analysts then raised their estimate to
43 cents, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Profit this year will be $1.69 a share, Skechers said, compared
with $1.24 last year. The company was expected to earn $1.59,
according to First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Other earnings from California companies:</TE>
<TE>   * Ryland Group Inc. said its first-quarter earnings surged 61%,
easily topping analyst estimates, as historically low mortgage rates
fueled strong demand for new homes and boosted home prices.</TE>
<TE>   Investors welcomed the news, bidding up shares of the
Calabasas-based homebuilder 41 cents to close at an at least 10-year
high of $108.31 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The stock has risen about 50% this year, outperforming the
Standard &amp; Poor's home building index, which has risen 15%.</TE>
<TE>   The company also declared a two-for-one stock split.</TE>
<TE>   Ryland posted net income of $26 million, or $1.83 per share,
compared with $16.1 million, or $1.12 a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts' estimates had ranged from $1.10 to $1.30 a share, with a
mean of $1.16 a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Home building revenue climbed 4.6% to $525.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Closings on the sales of homes rose 5% in the first quarter and
the average price rose 1.5% to $208,000.</TE>
<TE>   Home building revenue for first quarter 2002 included $4.5 million
from land sales, which contributed a net gain of $1 million to pretax
earnings.</TE>
<TE>   New orders fell about 5% to 3,757 in the quarter, although new
orders in March increased by 2.8%, Ryland said.</TE>
<TE>   Its backlog at the end of the quarter was up 1.3% from a year ago,
with 5,833 outstanding contracts at March 31. The dollar value of the
company's backlog at March 31 was $1.2 billion, about the same as a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it expects earnings for the full year of $10.25 a
share, up 75 cents from its previous view.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders of the company's common stock as of the close of
business May 15 will be entitled to one additional share for each
share held at that time.</TE>
<TE>   The new shares will be distributed May 30.</TE>
<TE>   * 21st Century Insurance Group reported first-quarter net of $8.3
million, or 10 cents per share, versus net income of $4.9 million, or
6 cents per share, for the year-ago quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter of 2002, the Woodland Hills-based insurer
said it executed various transactions to exit from its homeowner
line, resulting in a one-time after-tax charge of $3.7 million. It
also said it incurred legal defense costs in connection with a
California Senate bill, resulting in an after-tax charge of $900,000.</TE>
<TE>   Operating income totaled $11.8 million, or 14 cents a share,
versus $7.9 million, or 9 cents a share, in the year-ago period.</TE>
<TE>   * IndyMac Bancorp Inc. reported a 44% increase in quarterly profit
as its mortgage business increased market share.</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena-based lender posted earnings of $36 million, or 58
cents a share, compared with $25 million, or 39 cents, in the
year-earlier quarter. The year-earlier results excluded a
$10.2-million loss due to accounting changes, IndyMac said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expected the company to earn 58 cents a share in the
first quarter, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   * Chiron Corp., one of the world's largest biotech companies, said
it had an $18.9-million loss in the first quarter because of
acquisition costs and declining sales of vaccines. The
Emeryville-based company had a loss of 10 cents a share, contrasted
with net income of $44.7 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier.
Revenue fell to $252.2 million from $259.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   * United PanAm Financial Corp., a Newport Beach financial services
company, reported net income of $2.7 million, or 15 cents a share,

in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 10% to $16.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Standard Pacific Corp. in Irvine, one of the nation's largest
home builders, posted first-quarter net income of $17.8 million, or

earned in last year's first three months. Quarter revenue was

<HD>A Bright Spot in Health Insurance</HD>
<DH>Earnings: WellPoint reports a 46% rise in profit.
Managed-care firms post gains on rising premiums.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In this season of many dreary corporate earnings reports, the
nation's health insurance industry is emerging as an island of lush
profits as leading managed-care companies reap the benefits of hefty
premium increases.</LD>
<LD>   The latest example came Wednesday from WellPoint Health Networks
Inc. of Thousand Oaks, which beat analysts' expectations by posting a
46% increase in its first-quarter profit from a year earlier.
WellPoint, the parent of Blue Cross of California, said revenue for
the quarter jumped 51% to $3.9 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts attributed the surge in earnings to strong enrollment
gains, which were bolstered by acquisitions, price increases and
lower-than-expected costs for medical expenses and administration.</LD>
<TE>   "That's fabulous earnings growth," said William McKeever, a
health-care analyst at UBS Warburg in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The upbeat earnings from WellPoint, which follows a similarly rosy
report last week from UnitedHealth Group Inc., the nation's largest
managed-care firm, reflects skyrocketing prices for medical care,
especially at hospitals. Health insurance companies have been able to
pass these costs on to employers and consumers, and as a result
premiums have risen by double-digit rates in the last two years.
Early signs suggest that pattern will continue next year.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of Aetna Inc.--which some analysts say could
show a return to profitability when it announces its first-quarter
results today--most of the other major managed-care firms are
expected to post robust earnings growth for the first quarter and the
full year.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have been anticipating the gains. Standard &amp; Poor's
managed-care index, which contains WellPoint and four other big
companies, has climbed 21% since the start of the year, in contrast
to a year-to-date drop of 4.8% in the S&amp;P 500 index.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the long-term outlook for the managed-care industry
remains bright, despite greater resistance from employers to paying
big premium increases. During the economic expansion and tight labor
market of recent years, employers accepted the steadily rising
premiums as the price of doing business. But lately they have been
shifting more of the burden of higher medical costs to employees.</TE>
<TE>   The huge profits now being reported by health insurance firms are
likely to push more employers to take a tougher stance in negotiating
premiums. "Most employers we talk to are wrestling with the degree of
radicalism in which they want to approach this year," said Kirby
Bosley, who heads the health-care practice at Mercer Human Resource
Consulting in Los Angeles. Mercer's survey showed that large
employers nationwide last year paid, on average, $5,162 per employee
for medical, dental and prescription drug costs. That was about 11%
higher than in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Another study, released Wednesday by PricewaterhouseCoopers,
indicated that prescription drugs, medical devices and other medical
advances accounted for the biggest share of the nearly 14% increase
in health-care costs last year.</TE>
<TE>   But the report also said these factors could produce savings in
the future by reducing hospitalizations and other health-care
services.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, there are few signs that health-care costs will
slow down from this year's rapid pace--and that doesn't bode well for
employers, which clearly have lost the bargaining clout they once had
in the mid-1990s. That was evident last week when the California
Public Employees' Retirement System, the state's biggest single
purchaser of insurance, approved a record 25% increase in HMO
premiums for next year.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford A. Hewitt, a health analyst at the Baltimore brokerage
firm of Legg Mason, said it used to be that the performance of health
insurers followed a cyclical pattern in which they went up for
several years, then down for a period.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the managed-care industry, after a wrenching period of
restructuring and consumer backlash that has reduced HMO companies
and enrollment, now have a wider variety of health plans, better
efficiencies and a more sophisticated ability to predict and control
costs. All of these are likely to cushion the industry from the
vicissitudes of the insurance business.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, he said, WellPoint's latest quarterly report showed
that the company's premiums went up in the January-to-March period as
fast as their costs. WellPoint's medical loss ratio--or its cost of
providing health-care services divided by the premiums it
collected--held steady from a year earlier, at just under 81%, one of
the best ratios among the major managed-care companies.</TE>
<TE>   "You've had a shakeout in the industry; the peripheral players are
gone," he said of managed-care companies. "There's pricing
discipline. So managed-care organizations are not as likely today to
lower prices to win a piece of the business."</TE>
<TE>   Companies such as WellPoint also have the ability to drive future
revenue and earnings through acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   Purchases of existing health plans were a big factor in
WellPoint's strong membership gains in the last quarter, as it
expanded further beyond the California market into the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   For the first quarter, WellPoint said it earned $141.1 million, or
97 cents a share, compared with $96.5 million, or 74 cents, a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Management raised its earnings forecast for this year to $4 a
share from $3.85 a share. The average analyst estimate was $3.89 a
share.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint released its earnings report after the markets closed
Wednesday. Its shares closed up 78 cents, or 1.1%, at $71.48 on the
New York Stock Exchange, near its all-time high.</TE>

<DH>Wall St.: New 2002 low is a reminder that bear market in
tech and telecom names may not have run its course.</DH>

<LD>The "buy on the dip" strategy has failed again for many Nasdaq market
investors.</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite index Wednesday slid through its previous
2002 low, slumping 16.95 points, or 1%, to 1,713.34--its lowest level
since Halloween.</LD>
<LD>   The index's previous 2002 closing low of 1,716 was set Feb. 21.</LD>
<TE>   The technology-heavy index's new low for the year is a reminder
that although many stock sectors have stayed strong, the bear market
in major tech and telecom names may not have run its course.
Investors who bought into the sector last fall or after its sell-off
in February may have only losses to show for their courage.</TE>
<TE>   "The realization that has set in is that the market recovered too
quickly after Sept. 11, especially the tech and telecom sectors,"
said Jeff Van Harte, manager of the Transamerica Premier Equity
mutual fund in San Francisco, noting that the Nasdaq index rocketed
45% from Sept. 21 through Jan. 4.</TE>
<TE>   "The fundamentals of a lot of these companies have fallen off a
cliff in the last three to six months," Van Harte said. That has been
reflected in the poor first-quarter earnings many tech firms have
reported.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq index remains well above its three-year low of 1,423
reached Sept. 21 in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But investors who bought into the fourth-quarter rally have been
hammered--a familiar pattern since the tech bubble burst in spring
2000, and periodic rallies have quickly given way to renewed selling.</TE>
<TE>   For those with a shorter-term outlook, at least, this year's
sell-off has been another blow to the buy-the-dips mentality that
kept the bull market advancing through the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Microsoft fell 97 cents to $53.02 on Wednesday, bringing
the stock's year-to-date decline to 20%. It had rallied from $49.71
on Sept. 21 to a peak of nearly $70 on Jan. 17 before sliding anew.</TE>
<TE>   Chip maker Broadcom slid $1.45 to $34.01 Wednesday. The stock had
surged from $18.77 on Oct. 1 to $51.43 by Jan. 9. It's down 17% this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The broader market held up better Wednesday, as it has for most of
this year. The Dow industrial average eased 58.81 points, or 0.6%, to
10,030.43, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.7% to 1,093.14.</TE>
<TE>   Falling stocks outnumbered winners by a fairly narrow margin of 17
to 15 on the New York Stock Exchange, and by 19 to 16 on Nasdaq.
Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   Year-to-date, Nasdaq has slumped 12.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 is off
4.8% and the Dow is up 0.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Ryder, market strategist at First Union Securities in
Richmond, Va., said the Value Line composite, an "equally weighted"
index of 1,700 stocks, remains near its all-time high reached April
16, and that S&amp;P's small- and mid-cap stock indexes are up 9% and
5.7% year-to-date.</TE>
<TE>   "The broad market really is not as bad as the
capitalization-weighted indexes like the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 would
have you believe," Ryder said. "Aside from large-cap growth, things
have held up" as many investors have hunted for stocks that will
benefit from an economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder noted that Nasdaq's decline this year has "retraced"
slightly more than half of its fourth-quarter rally.</TE>
<TE>   From a chart-watcher's viewpoint, he said, that is "entirely
normal and should be expected after such a big move, even if it feels
awful."</TE>
<TE>   He warned, however, that a descent through the 1,630-1,640
level--which would represent a giveback of two-thirds of the Sept.
21-Jan. 4 rally--might raise the specter of the index falling to a
new multiyear low, further rattling investors.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading Wednesday, Treasury bond yields eased as mixed
economic data led traders to speculate that the Federal Reserve may
wait until the second half of the year to raise interest rates. The
yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 5.11% from 5.16%
on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Among Wednesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Software stocks led Nasdaq lower. Oracle dropped 62 cents to
$10.50, and Siebel Systems slumped $1.42 to $23.76.</TE>
<TE>   Other tech losers included IBM, down 83 cents to $86.50; Texas
Instruments, off 68 cents to $31.75; and KLA-Tencor, down $2.90 to
$60.31.</TE>
<TE>   * Some battered telecom stocks rebounded. AT&amp;T Wireless added 2
cents to $8.96; WorldCom Group gained 7 cents to $3.48.</TE>
<TE>   * Internet security specialist VeriSign plunged $3.58 to $18 after
SoundView Technology downgraded the stock, citing increased risk in
its domain-name business.</TE>
<TE>   * Online retailer Amazon.com was a bright spot in tech, zooming
$2.73 to $16.50 after posting a narrower-than-expected first-quarter
loss and raising its 2002 guidance. The stock is up 55% year-to-date.</TE>
<TE>   * InVision Technologies dived $6.91 to $27.44 even though the
maker of airport security scanners beat Wall Street earnings
expectations. The U.S. Transportation secretary said his agency will
need fewer machines than some had expected.</TE>
<TE>   * Amgen rose $1.36 to $56.11 after J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded
the biotech giant, forecasting strong revenue growth. Among other
drug and biotech companies, Biogen gained $1.36 to $42.90 and Forest
Labs soared $4.35 to $78.40 after both beat profit forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   * Power plant operator Calpine slipped $1.53 to $11.80 after
reporting a first-quarter loss and saying it will sell additional
shares.</TE>
<TE>   * In the financial sector, Merrill Lynch sagged $2.49 to $44.65 as
California and New Jersey joined the widening probe over analysts'
research. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter lost $2.51 to $50.99, and Lehman
Bros. fell $2.37 to $60.15.</TE>

<HD>Gates Scores Points for Appearance</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Microsoft chairman's testimony is in stark
contrast to a previous trial when he made a video deposition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The decision to put brilliant but volatile Microsoft Corp. Chairman
Bill Gates on the stand in the most important antitrust case since
the breakup of Standard Oil Co. turned out to be not so risky after
all.</LD>
<LD>   In the end, after three days of testifying in Microsoft's landmark
antitrust trial in U.S. District Court, it mattered little whether
the world's richest man presented a powerful legal argument. What
mattered more, experts say, is that Gates simply showed up in court
and came across as a human being.</LD>
<LD>   It was a classic courtroom strategy to win sympathy by showing a
human element amid the complex legal arguments over corporate
bullying.</LD>
<TE>   "He's helped because he's put a human face on the company," said
Ernest Gellhorn, an antitrust expert and law professor at George
Mason University in Fairfax, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Gates' appearance in court this week certainly seemed to resonate
in a courthouse where just four years ago the airing of his
videotaped deposition compounded Microsoft's legal woes.</TE>
<TE>   That video, which showed an evasive and petulant Gates slumped in
a chair, marked a low point for the company. It so riled the original
trial judge in the case that, in an interview published after the
trial, he likened Gates to Napoleon.</TE>
<TE>   But taking the witness stand for the first time in his company's
landmark antitrust case, Gates got a more benign reception.</TE>
<TE>   He drew a standing-room-only crowd during his first day of
testimony. And, more important, he drew the rapt attention of Judge
Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who took copious notes and frequently looked
directly at Gates while he testified.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a calculated risk, but it paid off huge," said Erick
Gustafson, a vice president at Citizens for a Sound Economy, a
conservative lobby group that has supported Microsoft's fight against
the government.</TE>
<TE>   "The videotape depicted Gates as evasive, out of touch, surly and
rude," Gustafson said. "But all of those myths were dispelled by his
appearance in court. He was gracious on the stand, and he was
engaged."</TE>
<TE>   Gates also may have been helped by the states' dilemma in
questioning him.</TE>
<TE>   The software mogul remains a popular figure--both in Silicon
Valley and among the public at large.</TE>
<TE>   That fact may have figured in the states' decision to let the more
gentle and low-key attorney Steven Kuney question Gates rather than
lead lawyer Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., one of Washington's best-known
litigators.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the states say that Kuney--who conducted Gates'
deposition--was better prepared to question the software mogul. And
some legal experts say Kuney's methodical and deferential approach
was well suited to eliciting damaging admissions from Gates.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, for example, Gates acknowledged that Microsoft
already has a kind of modular version of Windows that his government
adversaries have long insisted Microsoft should offer to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Gates said Windows XP Embedded, a special Windows version that is
marketed to retail outlets and others for use in cash registers,
kiosks and the like, is customizable and allows customers to include
or leave out Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, Windows Media
Player and other software.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Gates had testified that it would be impossible
to produce a version of Windows with removable features because
Internet Explorer and many other software components are dependent on
one another.</TE>
<TE>   But Gates said third-party software cannot be installed on Windows
XP Embedded because it works differently from the consumer versions
of Windows.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the admission, Gates, for the most part, delivered a
courtroom message little different from that of other Microsoft
witnesses: that tough antitrust punishment sought by the District of
Columbia, California and eight other states suing Microsoft would
cripple the software giant and hurt the computer industry.</TE>
<TE>   But Gates' appearance was significant nonetheless. It marked one
of the few times that he has stepped out of his protective cocoon of
publicists, security guards and other aides to publicly defend
himself and his company in a forum he does not control--the
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   It is an experience that other executives have faced with fear and
sometimes regret.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these CEOs hate lawyers [and the judicial process], but
more often than not it pays to have that face there," Gellhorn said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Keith Blackwell, who as president of Bristol Technology Inc.
testified several years ago in an antitrust suit his company brought
against Microsoft: "In terms of single events, being a witness in a
federal trial is the most compressed pressure I've faced as a CEO."</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be careful, because the things you say that you think
might be helping you can have a totally opposite effect," he said.
"You have to be patient enough to give that 'yes' or 'no' answer....
That's real difficult for CEOs to do because they are used to people
giving them deference."</TE>
<TE>   Gates got little of that during his three days in the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, for instance, Kollar-Kotelly kept Gates cooling his
heels for nearly an hour and a half outside the courtroom as she
debated procedural matters with lawyers for Microsoft and the states.</TE>
<TE>   And during another point earlier in the trial when testimony was
briefly suspended, Gates appeared relieved when the court bailiff
sauntered near him and struck up a conversation while Kollar-Kotelly
held a lengthy bench conference with lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Gates did his best to remain polite. He smiled and occasionally
even joked with his adversary--state trial lawyer Kuney. At one point
during cross-examination Wednesday, Gates quipped to Kuney that--like
Windows--the states' remedy proposals were so tightly integrated it
would be tough to remove or modify the individual proposals without
breaking the whole thing.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Submits Its Terms for Settlement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A week after settlement talks collapsed, accounting firm Arthur
Andersen sent a letter to the Justice Department on Wednesday
outlining conditions it would accept to settle an obstruction of
justice charge.</LD>
<LD>   Also Wednesday, Andersen representatives disclosed that the firm
is in talks to sell its middle-market practice to either BDO Seidman
or Grant Thornton. The sale would change the look of the accounting
industry by creating a large firm that fits between the top- and
second-tier businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The letter to the Justice Department is essentially a response to
the government's last offer to the firm when talks ended last week,
said Rusty Hardin, Andersen's defense attorney.</LD>
<TE>   "Now we have provided them with a document that says what we can
live with and why," Hardin said. "I have no idea whether it will lead
to anything.''</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm is seeking to reach an agreement with the
government to defer prosecution in return for an admission of
wrongdoing for destroying documents sought in the federal probe of
its work for Enron Corp. The trial is scheduled for May 6.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials said they received Andersen's letter
late Wednesday afternoon and had no immediate comment on it. Among
several conditions of the government deal, Andersen would have agreed
to a probationary period during which it would make a series of
operational changes and not violate any laws. Those talks ended last
week. The government had hoped to use the plea agreement to obtain
Andersen's cooperation in its investigation of Enron's senior
management, the energy trader's accounting practices and its
subsequent bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   According to Hardin, the Justice Department presented a package of
conditions to the accounting firm last week and said Andersen's
partnership had to agree to the entire package by April 18.</TE>
<TE>   Disagreement arose over whether the conditions were too
restrictive to allow Andersen to continue as an ongoing business,
Hardin said. Since negotiations broke off, the Justice Department has
maintained that it considers the settlement talks closed and is
moving ahead with the trial in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is trying to settle the federal charge, as well as a
class-action lawsuit filed by Enron investors and employees, so it
could preserve what is left of the firm. Andersen has lost several
hundred clients in recent months and is in the process of selling off
multiple offices and practices within the firm.</TE>
<TE>   But none of those deals can move forward until there is a legal
mechanism for shielding the buyers from Enron litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen partners talked with Grant Thornton executives about the
sale of its middle-market practice last week. And today, Andersen and
BDO Seidman executives are expected to discuss the outlines of a
competing deal.</TE>
<TE>   A decision is not expected for at least a week, according to
people familiar with the talks.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's recently hired restructuring expert, meanwhile, is
moving ahead with plans for the orderly sale of many of its offices
and practice groups.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Marsal of turnaround firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal said in a federal
court filing that his goal is to create a smaller firm that is still
a viable business.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is hemorrhaging clients in the wake of its role as the
accountant for Enron and many industry observers believe it will go
out of business.</TE>
<TE>   "Andersen is not in dissolution or liquidation. On the contrary,
every effort is being made to restructure the firm, achieving the
most value for its unneeded assets, and to preserve value for
Andersen's continuing businesses, its creditors, its partners and
employees," wrote Marsal in the April 16 filing in Houston federal
court, which became public Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   He filed the affidavit as part of a response by Andersen to civil
litigation plaintiffs who are trying to block the sale of the assets,
such as the middle-market practice sought by Grant Thornton and BDO
Seidman.</TE>
<TE>   In the filing, Marsal said Andersen would consider releasing some
of its 1,700 partners from non-compete clauses on a case-by-case
basis, as long as the firm is compensated fairly.</TE>
<TE>   Any continuing sales of separate units or smaller offices would
require buyers to hire partners, their support staff and pick up
obligations such as office leases, Marsal said.</TE>
<TE>   The firm already has an agreement to sell about half of its tax
practice to Deloitte &amp; Touche and is in talks to sell parts of its
Southern California operations to Deloitte and KPMG. All of these
deals are contingent on finding a legal mechanism that would protect
the buyers from Andersen's litigation liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever wins the bidding for Andersen's middle-market practice
will end up with a combined practice with about $700 million in
annual revenue and 500 partners and 4,000 to 5,000 staff members
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   However, the company will still be far smaller than KPMG, which
has more than $3 billion in U.S. revenue and about 1,500 partners.
Andersen's middle-market audit business, which caters to companies
with less than $1 billion in revenue, has about 200 partners and $300
million in audit revenue, said Allan Koltin, a Chicago accounting
industry consultant who is advising parties in the talks.</TE>
<TE>   The winning bidder, as it grows, would become large enough to
offer the type of tax and other consulting and specialty practices
that the biggest firms provide, said Bob Bunting, chief executive of
Seattle-based Moss Adams, a large second-tier firm based in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Bunting conceded that Moss Adams and other second-tier firms that
would like to purchase pieces of Andersen have been forced "to sit on
the sidelines" during this contest for the middle-market practice.
But he said this won't necessarily hurt the smaller firms.</TE>
<TE>   "Businesses tend to go to auditors who know their industry," he
said. "We have 400 apparel companies in Los Angeles, and unless this
winner winds up with a huge market share in that industry, they won't
be a threat to us."</TE>

<HD>Messier Faces His Critics at Meeting</HD>
<DH>Media: Vivendi Universal shareholders veto a stock-option
plan for management but OK firing of Pierre Lescure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER, MICHAEL A. HILTZIK and SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>His brash self-confidence beginning to fray at the cuffs, Vivendi
Universal Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier on Wednesday presided
over an unruly shareholders meeting in which he repeatedly was forced
to defend his regime against complaints on topics ranging from the
dismal performance of his company's stock and its muddled strategy to
its perceived slights against French cultural pride.</LD>
<LD>   Messier, 45, who has led the company's transformation over the
last two years from a water-and-sewage utility into the
second-largest entertainment conglomerate in the world, exuded calm
from his seat onstage at Zenith concert hall, a tent-like venue on
the Paris outskirts usually reserved for rock concerts.</LD>
<LD>   "I always retain my serenity no matter what the circumstances," he
said later.</LD>
<TE>   He spent much of the meeting singing the praises of the company's
subsidiaries, which include Universal Studios, the market-leading
Universal Music Group, and several European telecommunications and
television companies.</TE>
<TE>   But Messier acknowledged having "personally, involuntarily and
clumsily contributed" to confusion about Vivendi's corporate strategy
by "trying to explain too much."</TE>
<TE>   That admission did not quell the indignation over the
conglomerate's mediocre results and disorder on the floor throughout
the four-hour meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Hecklers kept up a constant counterpoint to Messier's remarks with
cries of "Resign!" and "Liar!" evidently reflecting sentiment in
France that Messier has reneged on commitments to shareholders as
well as to French regulators. This year, Vivendi's stock has fallen
40%.</TE>
<TE>   Among the unhappy was Marie Larquet, a 68-year-old widow in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   The value of her 20 Vivendi shares has fallen by 70% since she
bought them three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There's too much wealth for some," Larquet said, "and not enough
for the workers." For her, Messier's style of leadership is simply
"too American."</TE>
<TE>   The more than 5,000 shareholders in attendance had to pass through
metal detectors before entering the meeting. A dozen riot police
officers, wearing black uniforms and carrying helmets and batons,
mingled with about 200 protesters who gathered outside the venue and
handed out anti-Messier leaflets.</TE>
<TE>   The shareholders signaled their discontent with more than words,
defeating a new stock-option plan for management and a second
proposal that would have allowed the company to raise new capital
without giving shareholders first rights to purchase the new shares.</TE>
<TE>   But they failed to overturn Messier's most controversial recent
act, the firing last week of Pierre Lescure as chief of Vivendi's
money-losing Canal Plus pay television operation. Lescure, a
co-founder of the channel, was seen as a strong supporter of the
preservation of French culture. The ouster won support by a 55% to
45% margin, far narrower than is typical of most management
proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Messier appeared to have fended off for now the first signs of a
boardroom revolt. Board members were said to have privately discussed
the possibility of replacing Messier in response to the Canal Plus
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   There also had been speculation that the board might limit
Messier's duties, forcing him to give up either his chairman or his
CEO role. Instead, the board reaffirmed its support at a luncheon
meeting with him Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the shareholders meeting, board member Marc
Vienot, former CEO of French investment company Societe Generale,
rose to his feet at Messier's request to assure shareholders that the
board was behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were unhappy with Jean-Marie Messier we would have taken
measures," Vienot said.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Messier had reigned as the toast of French
corporate society and a standard-bearer in the march of French
companies into the global marketplace. By last year, investors were
showing rising dismay at Messier's inability to clearly articulate
his strategy, much less execute it. Vivendi shares have lost 50% in
the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Messier's efforts to refashion his company as an
American-style enterprise and himself as an American-style CEO
infuriated his countrymen. His firing of Lescure exacerbated the
furor over Vivendi's perceived neglect of its French roots, provoking
several French political leaders to threaten a government inquiry
into whether the company was complying with its regulatory
commitments.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's meeting, Messier attempted to mollify his domestic
critics, assuring the audience that Vivendi would "abide by all the
commitments of the past, including [providing] content to the French
film industry."</TE>
<TE>   But he strongly defended the firing of Lescure, many of whose
supporters among Canal Plus' work force were in the audience. Results
for the first quarter of 2002 released Wednesday showed the pay
television unit as the worst-performing group within Vivendi, losing
$57 million in the first quarter of 2002 alone.</TE>
<TE>   "Canal Plus was no longer performing as well as in the past,"
Messier said. Under its new management. "we will build a creative and
competitive Canal Plus, rest assured. But it has to be a success in
creative terms and economic terms."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Vivendi posted strong first-quarter results Wednesday,
with a downturn in music operations more than offset by growth of the
company's telecommunications and U.S. film businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Operating income for the company's media and telecommunications
assets jumped 27% in the period, to $387 million, compared with the
same quarter a year earlier. Revenue was up 12% in the quarter, to
$6.3 billion, compared with the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Operating income for the music group fell 61% during the quarter,
to $24 million. "Their margins have held up better than their peers
and were unsustainable," said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein. Among Universal's artists are No Doubt, Blink
182 and U2.</TE>
<TE>   One continuing bright spot for the company is Universal Studios,
which benefited in the quarter from the box office success of Imagine
Entertainment's Oscar-winning "A Beautiful Mind," among other
releases.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's American depository receipts on the New York Stock
Exchange declined $1.05 to $33.95 despite the better-than-expected
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts agreed that Messier still faces the task of defining his
company and himself more clearly.</TE>
<TE>   Messier "is a man between countries," Nathanson said. "The U.S.
doesn't see him as American and the French don't see him as one of
them."</TE>
<TE>   Messier and his management team spent much of Wednesday's meeting
pleading for time to allow the investment markets to recognize the
inherent value in its strategic changes.</TE>
<TE>   "Our strategy is starting to show an impact, but not in our share
price," he said, attributing Wall Street's disaffection with the
stock to "the handicap of being less well-known, more complex and
switching accounting systems" from French to American accounting
standards.</TE>
<TE>   But management also pledged to address some of the issues that
have undermined the company's stock, including its large debt load
and concerns that Messier might continue spending heavily to make
more high-profile acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   Messier said the company would make "no significant acquisition
activity" in the coming year.</TE>
<TE>   During the meeting Messier appeared visibly angry only once, when
a shareholder mentioned that Vivendi board member Edgar Bronfman is
president of the World Jewish Congress and then appeared to be
preparing an anti-Semitic diatribe. Messier promptly cut him off.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not tolerate personal attacks," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the turmoil, Messier seemed pleased after the meeting. He
said he had no intention of stepping down over the protest of his
leadership. "I'll be here for the next 15 years."</TE>

<HD>Decline in Long-Distance Expands Loss for AT&amp;T</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Corp.'s loss widened to nearly $1 billion during the first
quarter as the nation's largest long-distance telephone company
continued to lose customers to mobile phones, prepaid calling cards
and cheaper service plans.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the company posted a loss of $975 million, or 28
cents a share, on revenue of $12.02 billion, compared with a loss of
$192 million, or 10 cents a share, on revenue of $13.55 billion
during the same period a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Accounting changes contributed $856 million, or 24 cents a share,
to the loss total, AT&amp;T said. Excluding some expenses, the company
posted a profit of 6 cents a share, beating estimates of 4 cents a
share.</LD>
<TE>   Long-distance voice services declined 19% from the same quarter a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's actually a very basic, intuitive answer," said Alex Mou,
senior analyst with Hotovec, Pomeranz &amp; Co. "People are going to find
alternative ways of communicating, and I think that sort of reflects
in the overall equation."</TE>
<TE>   Serving 1.3 million customers in four states, AT&amp;T's consumer unit
posted a 22% drop in revenue to $3.13 billion. During the quarter,
the company launched local service in Michigan and Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   The broadband unit reported revenue of $2.44 billion, down 1.1%
from the quarter a year ago. AT&amp;T said it plans to spend $1.1 billion
this year on plant upgrades to reduce customer turnover and improve
technologies. The unit added more than half a million customers
during the three-month period.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T's business unit reported an 8% drop in revenue to $6.53
billion, due in part to the decline in long-distance services.</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey company's report comes one day after AT&amp;T Wireless
Services Inc., which was spun off from the company in July, posted a
first-quarter loss. A number of other telecom and wireless companies
also have seen losses this year.</TE>
<TE>   Though the company is a favorite in many portfolios, Mou said that
with long-distance "going down hard," the company's cable division is
the only attractive entity. But AT&amp;T agreed in December to sell the
unit to Comcast Corp. for $72 billion and the company is planning a
1-for-5 reverse stock split to boost its share price after the deal
closes.</TE>
<TE>   "They slightly beat the numbers, but I'm not too impressed on what
they're trying to offer longer term," Mou said. "We believe that AT&amp;T
is on the road down."</TE>
<TE>   Shares closed down 10 cents at $13.75 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Earnings were reported before the start of regular trading.</TE>

<HD>Calpine Stock Drops Sharply</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calpine Corp. shares plunged 11% on Wednesday after the power-plant
developer warned that it would post a first-quarter loss and sell
stock to raise cash.</LD>
<LD>   The stock fell $1.53 to $11.80 on Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange. The shares had gained 12% on Tuesday as California dropped
complaints against Calpine after renegotiating multiyear power
contracts. The stock has fallen 79% in the last year.</LD>
<LD>   Calpine will post a loss of about 25 cents a share after incurring
costs related to canceling orders for turbines, the company said
after the close of trading Tuesday. It also plans to sell as many as
69 million new shares, which would be worth $814 million at
Wednesday's closing price.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's a knee-jerk reaction to the dilution" in shareholder
equity, said David P. Brady, who manages $1 billion, including the
Stein Roe Young Investor Fund, which owns 620,000 Calpine shares. San
Jose-based Calpine last month canceled $3 billion in turbine
purchases as it scaled back expansion plans. Energy companies have
delayed projects or sold assets to bolster their balance sheets after
the collapse of Enron Corp. eroded investor confidence in the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine plans to sell 60 million new shares to pay debt and may
offer 9 million more, depending on demand, hoping to raise "a little
over $800 million," Chief Financial Officer Robert Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine said Tuesday it would have had a first-quarter profit of
about 10 cents a share, excluding equipment-cancellation costs and
other items. On that basis it was expected to earn 13 cents a share,
the average estimate in a poll by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Full results are scheduled to be released May 2.</TE>

<HD>Blockbuster Posts Loss; Revenue Rises</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blockbuster Inc. had a first-quarter loss because of investment
declines. Revenue increased 1% on increased sales of used DVDs, VHS
tapes and games.</LD>
<LD>   Blockbuster's loss was $1.75 billion, or $9.72 a share, compared
with net income of $4.7 million, or 3 cents, a year earlier. Sales
rose to $1.33 billion from $1.31 billion, the Dallas-based company
said.</LD>
<LD>   A new accounting rule forces companies to periodically review the
value of acquisitions and record expenses if they've fallen. That
resulted in $1.82 billion in costs in the quarter, Blockbuster said.
Excluding those costs, the company said it would have earned $66
million, or 37 cents a share, more than analyst forecasts.</LD>
<TE>   Blockbuster, which is 82% owned by Viacom Inc., was expected to
report a profit of 28 cents a share, according to analysts polled by
Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Blockbuster is focusing more on renting DVDs because they provide
a profit margin that's 10 percentage points higher than renting
videocassettes. DVD rentals in the first quarter rose 115%.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USA Networks Inc., the media company controlled by Barry Diller, said
its first-quarter loss widened more than tenfold because the value of
acquisitions fell. Sales rose at the company's electronic-commerce
businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The loss increased to $286.4 million, or 73 cents a share, from
$26.6 million, or 7 cents, in the year-earlier quarter, the company
said. USA Networks' sales rose 5% to $1.37 billion from $1.31
billion.</LD>
<LD>   Diller is selling USA Networks' entertainment division to Vivendi
Universal. That will leave USA Networks to focus on commerce
businesses including the Home Shopping Network and travel Web site
Expedia, where cash flow rose.</LD>
<TE>   Operating cash flow rose 45% to $116.7 million at the businesses
that USA Networks isn't selling.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding some costs and the entertainment division that will be
sold, USA Networks said it would have had a first-quarter profit of 5

<HD>7 Blacks Accuse Del Taco of Bias</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a rare minority-versus-minority discrimination lawsuit, one
current and six former African American employees of Del Taco Inc.
are accusing the nation's second-largest Mexican food chain of
turning a blind eye to Latino workers repeatedly harassing them
because of their race.</LD>
<LD>   The civil suit, filed in Los Angeles on March 13, alleges the
Laguna Hills-based company tolerated Latino employees verbally
abusing some blacks, passing them over for promotions in favor of
Latinos and even firing blacks and replacing them with undocumented
Latino workers.</LD>
<LD>   Blacks who complained about their poor treatment lost their jobs,
according to the suit, which seeks unspecified damages including lost
wages, punitive damages and reinstatement.</LD>
<TE>   Closely held Del Taco, which has 395 restaurants in 10 states,
said it had received the lawsuit document but declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   James Urbanic, lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said Del Taco
wasn't "African American friendly."</TE>
<TE>   "In this day and age, it's shocking to see black employees treated
worse than Hispanic ones," he said. "Del Taco ignored [African
American] complaints and then retaliated when people came forward."</TE>
<TE>   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency
that enforces anti-discrimination laws in the workplace, keeps no
statistics on minority-versus-minority discrimination litigation,
although such lawsuits are uncommon, EEOC spokesman David Grinberg
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Grinberg expects them to become more prevalent as a
higher percentage of minorities enter the labor force.</TE>
<TE>   Urbanic said the lawsuit paints a picture of Latino mistreatment
of blacks at Del Taco and the company's inability or unwillingness to
stop it.</TE>
<TE>   Calvin Moore, 21, former work-shift leader who is black, was
subjected to repeated verbal taunts by Latino co-workers, the lawsuit
alleges.</TE>
<TE>   His Latino colleagues also allegedly told his pregnant girlfriend
she was "carrying a monkey's baby," according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Moore told area supervisors about his mistreatment, but they took
no action against his Latino co-workers, the suit said. After
complaining several times, he was fired, the suit said.</TE>

<DH>Economy: Orders for durable goods and sales of new homes
fall. But analysts doubt the data.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. economic growth showed signs of stuttering slightly from the
speedy pace earlier this year, according to reports Wednesday showing
softer demand for durable goods and slower sales of new homes.</LD>
<LD>   Orders for costly manufactured goods dropped 0.6% in March while
new-home sales fell 3.1%, selling at an annual rate of 878,000, below
the forecast pace of 882,000.</LD>
<LD>   "It just signals a bit of a pull-back from the exceptionally
strong data seen earlier in the year," said Mark Vitner, an economist
at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.</LD>
<TE>   In the durable goods report, the Commerce Department said orders
fell in many sectors, and the housing report, released by the same
department, showed inventories of new homes for sale rose to their
highest level in two years.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Treasury yields dropped on the weak data, which bolstered a
view that the Federal Reserve can be patient about raising interest
rates as it waits for more signs of sustained U.S. economic strength.
Fed policymakers hold their next scheduled meeting May 7 amid
expectations they will leave rates untouched.</TE>
<TE>   The durable goods numbers also seemed to raise questions about Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan's assertion Monday that business investment
has started to turn around.</TE>
<TE>   Business investment in new equipment is crucial for a solid
recovery as pent-up consumer demand is expected to be weaker than in
past recoveries.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said the data released Wednesday should not cloud the
overall economic outlook.</TE>
<TE>   For one, the durable goods report arrived without any data for the
closely watched semiconductor sector.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department said not enough manufacturers had
responded to the survey, so it was forced to eliminate the sector
from the series in a surprise move.</TE>
<TE>   "The semiconductor confusion highlights what an unscientific
measure of factory orders this report is," said Lou Crandall, chief
economist at R.H. Wrightson &amp; Associates in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Several economists said that although there remain questions about
the economic recovery's strength, the reports Wednesday didn't add
much detail.</TE>
<TE>   "On balance, the durable series tends to be volatile month to
month," said Eric Green, senior economist at BNP Paribas in New York.
"The trend is clearly improving."</TE>
<TE>   Fed officials also were cautiously upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   Fed Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson said the economic outlook had
brightened, and Richmond Fed President Alfred Broaddus said the
economy is doing better, but he emphasized that the strength of final
demand remained a key economic question.</TE>
<TE>   And in its anecdotal report on the economy, also released
Wednesday, the Fed said economic growth is improving after falling
into recession last year, but echoed officials by saying concerns
remain about the pace of recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost all Federal Reserve districts reported signs of
improvement or actual increases in economic activity since the last
survey" released in March, the Fed said in its "beige book" report on
conditions across the country.</TE>

<HD>Hewlett Disputes HP's Claims on Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WILMINGTON, Del.</DL>
<LD>Dissident Hewlett-Packard Co. director Walter Hewlett cast doubts
Wednesday on a key HP justification for its planned $19-billion
acquisition of Compaq Computer Corp.</LD>
<LD>   During testimony at the trial over his suit to block the merger,
Hewlett disputed claims by HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina that
managers intentionally low-balled the potential benefits of the
combined company.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett said that during his 15 years on the board of Palo
Alto-based HP, managers of the company's business units have
typically operated in the opposite fashion--presenting "overly
optimistic" revenue estimates to the board of directors.</LD>
<TE>   "It was the responsibility of senior management to give them a
haircut," Hewlett said on the stand, suggesting that worries about
the merger might be even deeper than internal memos stated.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Hewlett's lawyers presented internal documents
suggesting that HP executives knew before the March 19 vote that the
integration process was in trouble, and that anticipated cost savings
and profit would be far below projections.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony Tuesday and Wednesday, Fiorina and Chief Financial
Officer Robert Wayman discounted those reports as "snapshots" that
gave a false overall impression. They called internal doubts about
HP's projections classic "sandbagging"--efforts by managers of the
anticipated business units of the merged company to "set the bar low"
in order to easily distinguish themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The top managers said that their own, more optimistic estimates
were more accurate.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said that the credibility of such divergent
positions might be unclear even after all evidence is heard. This
would leave the answer up to William Chandler III, the judge
presiding over the case in Delaware's Chancery Court.</TE>
<TE>   "He is judge and jury," said Reinier Kraakman, professor of law at
Harvard University. "He makes the findings of fact and decides on
that basis. He has a huge discretion."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, Fiorina and Wayman denied that they had in any
way coerced Deutsche Bank, a major institutional shareholder, with
the promise of HP business in return for its support for the merger.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, tempers flared as Fiorina was questioned by
Hewlett's attorney, Stephen Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "Sir, you are accusing the CEO of a publicly traded company of
lying," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm only asking you questions right now," Neal replied.</TE>
<TE>   HP fell 83 cents to $17.21 on Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange
trading.</TE>

<HD>Labor Report Criticizes Workplace Protection Plan</HD>
<DH>Safety: On-the-job fatalities climb for Latino workers,
despite an overall decline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade-long decline in the rate of repetitive-motion workplace
injuries slowed to a near-standstill in 2000 and even climbed in some
states, including California, according to an analysis of federal
data by the AFL-CIO.</LD>
<LD>   The national labor federation's annual report on workplace
injuries, to be released today, also noted that although job
fatalities declined overall, they increased among Latino workers. The
on-the-job fatality rate in 2000 for Latinos was 5.6 per 100,000, the
highest in at least five years.</LD>
<LD>   The report was highly critical of the Bush administration's record
on worker protection, particularly its repeal of a short-lived
ergonomic standard that recently was replaced with voluntary
compliance guidelines.</LD>
<TE>   "The Bush regulatory agenda makes clear that the administration is
abandoning or delaying action on many important worker protection
measures by withdrawing and halting action of dozens of standards,"
the report said. It also noted that the proposed 2003 calls for cuts
in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration budget.</TE>
<TE>   An administration spokeswoman noted, however, that the trends
cited in the AFL-CIO report predate President Bush's inauguration.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao last month acknowledged that
there was mixed news in the latest batch of injury and illness
statistics, which had "edged down" overall despite increases for
certain workers, including truck drivers, laborers and nursing aides.</TE>
<TE>   She also said more work was needed to reduce repetitive-motion
injuries and expressed hope that the administration's new ergonomics
plan would help pull rates down further.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also acknowledged high fatality rates for
Latino workers. In testimony to the Senate, Assistant Secretary of
Labor John Henshaw, who directs OSHA, said in February that the
disproportionate share of fatalities is due largely to Latino workers
being concentrated in hazardous industries, such as construction.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Henshaw announced several initiatives, including the
development of Spanish-language materials, to address the problem.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national injury
and illness rate fell slightly, from 6.3 per 100 workers in 1999 to
6.1 per 100 workers in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   However, Peg Seminario, who directs the worker safety program for
the AFL-CIO and was the chief author of the report, said her analysis
of the numbers reveals a troubling trend.</TE>
<TE>   "For some groups of workers, things are getting worse," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In California, for example, repetitive-motion injuries increased
by a substantial margin.</TE>
<TE>   According to the union report, in California, musculoskeletal
disorders--such as strains, back pain and carpal tunnel
syndrome--went from 46.1 incidents per 10,000 workers in 1999 to 54.3
incidents per 10,000 workers in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Dean Fryer of the state Department of Industrial
Relations said the cause of increase was not clear, but it stem could
in part from increased reporting.</TE>
<TE>   As another factor, the AFL-CIO report cited competitive forces
that have led to longer hours and increases in the pace of work,
along with changes in technology and work processes associated with
higher incidents of repetitive stress and strain.</TE>

<HD>Giuliani Working for Merrill Lynch</HD>
<DH>Securities: Former New York mayor is helping to negotiate a
settlement with state's attorney general. Legal expert says company's
move could backfire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. on Wednesday said it hired former New York Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani to help it negotiate with the state attorney
general over charges of deception and conflict of interest in
Merrill's stock-research operation.</LD>
<LD>   Tapping Giuliani shows how seriously Merrill takes Atty. Gen.
Eliot Spitzer's allegations and the damage they could do to the No. 1
brokerage, said former federal prosecutor Christopher J. Bebel of
Houston law firm Shepherd, Smith &amp; Bebel.</LD>
<LD>   But the move "could end up backfiring on Merrill in a major way
because it draws more attention to the investigation and the
underlying misconduct" alleged, Bebel said.</LD>
<TE>   Spitzer stunned Merrill and Wall Street on April 8 when he accused
the firm's Internet analysts of recommending stocks in 2000 and 2001
simply to curry favor with the companies. Spitzer said a 10-month
investigation turned up Merrill e-mails showing analysts privately
disparaging stocks while strongly advising clients to buy them.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails reinforced long-standing allegations that brokerage
analysts tailor their recommendations to help their
investment-banking colleagues win lucrative advisory and
stock-underwriting business.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout from the Spitzer probe ultimately could cost Merrill
$2 billion in fines, legal settlements and lost business from
disgruntled customers, David M. Trone, an analyst at Prudential
Securities, estimated in a report Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Trone said that the market has overreacted to
the Spitzer revelations, pounding $4.4 billion of market value out of
the stock since April 8. The shares fell $2.49 more on Wednesday, to
$44.65 in New York Stock Exchange trading.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani, a former U.S. attorney in New York who aggressively
prosecuted insider trading and other securities cases in the 1980s,
opened a private consulting business, Giuliani Partners, after ending
his term as mayor Jan. 1. The company was formed as a venture with
accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Giuliani and Spitzer have had just one conversation--on
April 8, a few hours before Spitzer went public with the results of
his probe, said Giuliani spokeswoman Sunny Mindel.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani has been offering Merrill advice on how to make
structural changes to enhance its research unit's independence from
its investment-banking operation. He also has been authorized to
negotiate directly with Spitzer's office toward a broad settlement,
Mindel said.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides are said to be far apart on terms of a settlement,
with Spitzer holding out for an acknowledgment of wrongdoing by
Merrill, plus fines and restitution of as much as $250 million,
according to people familiar with the attorney general's position.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani emphasized Merrill's corporate citizenship in his
conversation with Spitzer, Mindel said. The former mayor noted that
Merrill and 8,500 employees returned to its World Financial Center
headquarters as soon as possible after the building was rocked by the
Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the adjacent World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, acceding to one of Spitzer's demands, Merrill agreed to
provide greater disclosure about its business relationships with
companies covered by its analysts. The first tangible result of that
agreement appeared Wednesday on Merrill's Internet site, where it
listed the names of 640 corporate clients.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has expanded his investigation of analysts' conduct to
include other top Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley, CS
First Boston and Goldman Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has been pushing--unsuccessfully, so far--for federal
legislation to bolster analyst independence within securities firms.</TE>
<TE>   He also has said his office intends to cooperate with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the top federal securities
regulator. Spitzer met for about an hour Wednesday in Washington with
SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt. Neither side offered details of the
discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators in California and New Jersey are joining their New York
counterparts to head a multi-state task force to look further into
issues raised by Spitzer's probe, the North American Securities
Administrators Assn. said this week.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Barr Laboratories Inc. received Food and Drug Administration approval
for its generic copy of Merck &amp; Co.'s top-selling osteoporosis drug
Fosamax, pending the outcome of a legal challenge.</LD>
<LD>   Merck sued Barr last year to prevent it from making a copy of
Fosamax, claiming patent infringement. Merck owns patents covering
the processes for producing the drug. Those patents don't begin to
expire until 2007.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA decision allowing Barr to sell the medicine will take
effect only if Barr wins the patent case or when the manufacturing
patents expire, Barr said.</LD>

<HD>Philip Morris Joins Push for Standard</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Reversing course, Philip Morris Inc. is pushing the government to
require tobacco companies to produce cigarettes that quickly
extinguish themselves if smokers don't do the job.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's largest tobacco company has joined health and safety
advocates urging Congress to adopt a national standard. The aim is to
reduce the hundreds of U.S. deaths each year from smoking-related
fires.</LD>
<LD>   Philip Morris is the only U.S. company now making
self-extinguishing cigarettes. But a key reason for the company's new
support of a federal requirement has to do with a New York law saying
only self-extinguishing cigarettes may be sold in that state starting
next year.</LD>
<TE>   Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey and Rhode Island are
considering taking similar steps, according to the National
Conference of State Legislatures. Approval in those states could lead
to a production and distribution nightmare, said Mark Berlind,
associate general counsel for Philip Morris Management Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighter and fire safety groups for years have sought a
government requirement that tobacco companies produce
self-extinguishing cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco companies, a powerful lobby on Capitol Hill, opposed the
idea and Congress required only that the issue be studied.</TE>

<HD>GE CEO Irked by Stock's Performance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co.'s Jeffrey Immelt, in his first address as
chairman and chief executive at the company's annual shareholder
meeting, expressed his displeasure with the performance of GE stock
since he took control in September.</LD>
<LD>   "I hate where the stock price is," Immelt said during the meeting
at the Waukesha, Wis., headquarters of GE's medical-imaging unit.
"Our stock price today does not reflect the performance, or the
value, of our company."</LD>
<LD>   Immelt reiterated that sales will rise at least 5% this year, led
by acquisitions and growth in expanding markets such as China. GE
shares have dropped 17% since Immelt succeeded Jack Welch--lagging
behind the gains of benchmark indexes--on concern about declining
sales and questions about the transparency of the company's
accounting.</LD>
<TE>   The firm's more economically sensitive businesses, plastics and
the NBC broadcasting network, are improving, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Net income at GE fell for the first time in more than seven years
in the first quarter because of a decline in the value of some of its
acquisitions, and sales were little changed.</TE>
<TE>   GE shares fell 30 cents to $32.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock has dropped 19% this year, compared with a 4.8% slump in
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.</TE>

<LD>Lockheed Martin Corp. said it reached a tentative agreement with a
union representing striking aircraft workers in Marietta, Ga. Terms
weren't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   About 2,600 members of the International Assn. of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers walked off the job March 11 because of
disagreements over the company's plans to send additional work at the
plant to outside contractors. The agreement is subject to a vote by
the members of the machinists union. The strike was the first at the
plant since 1977.</LD>
<LD>   The machinists union also represents workers at facilities in
California and Florida, who accepted Lockheed's contract offer in
March.</LD>

Excluding some costs, Expedia said it would have had profit of $28.4
million, or 46 cents a share, 20 cents better than estimates. Sales
more than doubled to $116 million.</LD>

<LD>Roche Holding Chief Financial Officer Erich Hunziker said the Swiss

the end of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   "We will announce a solution this year definitely," Hunziker said.</LD>
<LD>   Selling the vitamin business would help Roche focus on making
medicines, a business whose sales growth has lagged behind that of
rivals. In the first quarter, drug revenue rose 5%, below the
industry average of about 9%.</LD>
<TE>   Hunziker declined to say whether Roche will divest the unit
through an initial public offering or through a sale. "We have all
options open at the moment," he said.</TE>

<LD>* Xerox Corp., whose sales have dropped eight quarters in a row, had
a first-quarter loss because of costs to exit the inkjet printer
business, job cuts and a decline in demand for color copiers. The
loss was $64 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with net income of
$202 million, or 25 cents, a year earlier. The world's largest copier
maker said that the figures are preliminary because it's restating
results for the last five years as part of a settlement of
allegations it inflated revenue to bolster earnings. Sales dropped
12% to $3.7 billion. Excluding certain costs, Xerox said profit would
have been $53 million or 7 cents.</LD>
<LD>   * Wireless technology firm Qualcomm Inc. reported a 60% drop in
quarterly profit. Qualcomm earned $43.9 million, or 5 cents per
share, in the first three months of the year, compared with $109.7
million, or 14 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 20 cents per share.</LD>
<LD>   * Intersil Corp., an Irvine maker of chips for wireless networks
and personal computers, reported a 64% drop in first-quarter profit,
to $13.8 million, or 13 cents a share, from $38.4 million, or 35
cents, a year ago. Sales rose 5% to $134.1 million.</LD>
<TE>   * Epicor Software Corp., an Irvine provider of electronic business
software, posted a net loss of $2.7 million, or 6 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of $22.1 million, or 53 cents a share, for
last year's first quarter. Revenue declined 25% to $36 million. The
company said last year's results included revenue from two product
lines that were divested in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * Rainbow Technologies Inc., an Irvine Internet security company,
reported first-quarter net income of $569,000, or 2 cents a share,
contrasted with a net loss of $2.6 million, or 10 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue declined 18% to $33 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Symantec Corp., which makes software for fending off computer
viruses, had a fiscal fourth-quarter profit as sales increased. Net
income was $4.78 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$27.4 million, or 18 cents, a year earlier, Symantec said in a
statement distributed by Business Wire. Sales in the quarter ended
March 31 rose 24% to $310.8 million from $250.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   * LSI Logic Corp., a maker of custom semiconductors and computer
data-storage systems, said its first-quarter loss widened as
customers delayed or canceled orders. The firm had a loss of $171.8
million, or 47 cents a share, wider than the year-earlier loss of
$31.2 million, or 10 cents. Sales fell 20% to $412.5 million from
$517.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Web design software maker Macromedia Inc. posted a fiscal
fourth-quarter net loss that was nearly four times larger than a year
ago. The software maker had a net loss that ballooned to $80.5
million, or $1.37 per share, from a net loss of $21.8 million, or 42
cents a share, a year earlier. Total revenue slipped about 15% to
$75.6 million from $89.1 million.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission shut down an e-mail scam that
promised free video-game consoles but instead delivered a connection
to a pornographic Web site that charged $3.99 per minute. According
to the FTC, Internet users received an e-mail message saying they had
won a Sony PlayStation 2 in a sweepstakes contest sponsored by Web
portal Yahoo Inc. Those who responded to the message were directed to
a bogus Yahoo page that instructed them to download a program that
would allow them to claim the prize. The program then connected them
to a pornographic Web page.</LD>

<LD>* Xerox Corp., whose sales have dropped eight quarters in a row, had
a first-quarter loss because of costs to exit the inkjet printer
business, job cuts and a decline in demand for color copiers. The
loss was $64 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with net income of
$202 million, or 25 cents, a year earlier. The world's largest copier
maker said that the figures are preliminary because it's restating
results for the last five years as part of a settlement of
allegations it inflated revenue to bolster earnings. Sales dropped
12% to $3.7 billion. Excluding certain costs, Xerox said profit would
have been $53 million or 7 cents.</LD>
<LD>   * Wireless technology firm Qualcomm Inc. reported a 60% drop in
quarterly profit. Qualcomm earned $43.9 million, or 5 cents per
share, in the first three months of the year, compared with $109.7
million, or 14 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 20 cents per share.</LD>
<LD>   * Symantec Corp., which makes software for fending off computer
viruses, had a fiscal fourth-quarter profit as sales increased. Net
income was $4.78 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$27.4 million, or 18 cents, a year earlier, Symantec said in a
statement distributed by Business Wire. Sales in the quarter ended
March 31 rose 24% to $310.8 million from $250.6 million.</LD>
<TE>   * Telecommunications equipment maker Tekelec posted a smaller
first-quarter profit. The company earned $2.9 million, or 5 cents a
share, before one-time items, compared with $8.04 million, or 13
cents a share, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   * LSI Logic Corp., a maker of custom semiconductors and computer
data-storage systems, said its first-quarter loss widened as
customers delayed or canceled orders amid a slowdown in the U.S.
economy. The company had a loss of $171.8 million, or 47 cents a
share, wider than the year-earlier loss of $31.2 million, or 10
cents. Sales fell 20% to $412.5 million from $517.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Web design software maker Macromedia Inc. posted a fiscal
fourth-quarter net loss that was nearly four times larger than a year
ago. The software maker had a net loss that ballooned to
$80.5million, or $1.37 per share, from a net loss of $21.8 million,
or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Total revenue slipped about 15%
to $75.6million from $89.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Intersil Corp., a maker of chips for wireless networks and
personal computers, reported a 64% drop in first-quarter profit, to
$13.8 million, or 13 cents a share, from $38.4 million, or 35 cents,
a year ago. Sales rose 5% to $134.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Epicor Software Corp., an Irvine provider of electronic business
software, posted a net loss of $2.7million, or 6 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of $22.1million, or 53 cents a share, for
last year's first quarter. Revenue declined 25% to $36 million. The
company said last year's results included revenue from two product
lines that were divested in the second quarter.</TE>

<HD>TRW Board Urged to Open Books</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Vote signals that shareholders are willing to
consider the bid, analysts say, adding pressure for talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TRW Inc. shareholders urged company executives to share detailed
financial records with Northrop Grumman Corp., in what some analysts
called the first symbolic gesture that the shareholders were willing
to consider Northrop's hostile bid.</LD>
<LD>   The vote, which came during an annual meeting in TRW's hometown of
Cleveland, could put added pressure on TRW directors to open up the
books and begin talks with Northrop, analysts said. It marked the
first time that shareholders were asked to vote on Northrop's offer
to acquire the company for $6.7 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Though the move did not represent an outright endorsement of the
bid, it was one of several hurdles that Century City-based Northrop
has to overcome in its bid for the defense and automotive parts
company. A vote against the proposal could have hindered Northrop's
ability to pursue TRW, one of the defense industry's last major
concerns largely untouched by consolidation.</LD>
<TE>   Northrop faces another major hurdle next week, when TRW
shareholders hold a special meeting to consider proposals that would
mitigate certain restrictions in Ohio law regarding hostile
takeovers. One proposal would allow shareholders who acquired more
than $250,000 of TRW stock after Northrop announced its bid to have a
vote on the offer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one more step in what tends to be a long, drawn-out
process," said Jon B. Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment
Partners Inc., a Los Angeles-based defense industry investment bank.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, TRW and Northrop claimed their first victory.
TRW officials said shareholders rejected two other proposals
submitted by Northrop, which they said demonstrated shareholders'
confidence "not only in the TRW board but also in the strategic
direction of our company."</TE>
<TE>   As expected, TRW shareholders rebuffed a proposal to establish a
panel of independent directors and an initiative that would have
urged TRW directors to give shareholders the ability to decide for
themselves whether to exchange their shares for Northrop's stock.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop is offering to exchange each TRW share for $53 of
Northrop shares. Northrop raised its offer of $47 after TRW directors
rejected it as "grossly inadequate."</TE>
<TE>   TRW directors said the revised offer was still "inadequate" and
announced it was accelerating plans to break up the company, selling
off its airplane parts business, using the proceeds to pay down debt
and then spinning off its debt-laden automotive parts operation. TRW
would then keep its military satellite and defense electronics
business, a plan similar to what Northrop said it would undertake
once it acquired the company.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw it as a very strong endorsement of our strategic plan,"
TRW Chairman Philip Odeen said in an interview Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   He added that he didn't think the shareholders' vote urging
management to share financial information would place any added
pressure on the board to begin talks with Northrop.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see that at all," Odeen said. "We're already focused on
opening the books, and we'll do the right thing as long as it is in
the best interest of the shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Northrop said the shareholders were sending a
"strong message" to TRW executives to give Northrop access to the
financial records without undue restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Al Myers, Northrop's treasurer, said the company would be willing
to pay a higher price if there was confidential information that
enhances TRW's value. "Show us the hidden value," Myers said.</TE>
<TE>   TRW shares eased 33 cents to $54.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>AOL Posts Record $54.2-Billion Loss</HD>
<DH>Media: The expected first-quarter write-down stems from
rule changes in how companies must account for mergers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner's problems continued Wednesday as the company posted
the biggest quarterly loss in U.S. corporate history at $54.2
billion, or $12.25 a share.</LD>
<LD>   The company also warned that cash flow will fall short of
expectations this year because of a slowdown in ad sales at its
America Online Internet unit.</LD>
<LD>   AOL Time Warner had forecast the loss earlier this year. The loss
was due to a change in accounting rules governing how companies
account for mergers. The $54.2-billion write-down on AOL Time
Warner's balance sheet, however, did not involve cash losses and has
no effect on operations.</LD>
<TE>   The previous record for quarterly loss was $41.8 billion by fiber-
optic concern JDS Uniphase Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the AOL Time Warner loss reflects how badly the
biggest media merger has failed to live up to expectations when it
was announced two years ago. Investors have battered the stock to new
lows, slashing AOL Time Warner's total stock market value by more
than $100 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Had this been managed more effectively, the situation would not
be so bleak," said analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Gerard Klauer Mattison
in Los Angeles. "They're in the penalty box for a while."</TE>
<TE>   As a result of AOL's problems in its Internet business, the
company said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or EBITDA, will rise at a slower rate than previously
projected, from 5% to 9% rather than the 8% to 12% Wall Street had
expected. EBITDA, a measure of cash flow, is a key gauge Wall Street
uses for media companies.</TE>
<TE>   America Online continues to be a drag on the company. AOL Time
Warner said it continues to see a steep drop in online advertising,
which historically generates high profit margins. In the last year,
AOL's online ad sales suffered a 31% drop; ad sales fell 10% for the
entire company.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner announced its results Wednesday after the stock
market closed. Its stock edged up 19 cents to $19.30 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Without the huge accounting loss, AOL Time Warner's results would
have been flat with a loss of $1 million, compared with a
$1.4-billion loss a year earlier. The company said cash flow rose 3%
to $2.05 billion in the quarter, or 18 cents a share, and beat the 14
cents a share Wall Street analysts had projected. A year earlier, AOL
Time Warner had cash flow of 16 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Some areas of the company had stellar results. Its film unit was
boosted by results from the Warner Bros. film "Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone" and New Line Cinema's "Lord of the Rings: the
Fellowship of the Ring." The two films combined have grossed more
than $1.7 billion worldwide at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   The company also blamed some of America Online's lagging results
on the demise of its IPlanet E-Commerce Solutions, a software
alliance with Sun Microsystems Inc. formed after AOL bought Netscape
Communications Corp. three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Parsons, who will take over next month from Gerald Levin
as chief executive of AOL Time Warner, in a conference call vowed to
reverse the slide.</TE>

<TE>AOL Time Warner's Record Loss</TE>
<TE>   Sweeping new accounting rules have forced media and technology
companies to post huge financial losses in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, AOL Time Warner posted a $54.2-billion
quarterly loss, the largest in U.S. corporate history.</TE>
<TE>   Under new accounting rules, companies are required to reduce
the amount of ``goodwill'' on their books--or the difference
between the price of assets a company purchased and their fair
market value.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, many companies used their soaring stock
prices to buy other companies. In 2000, when Internet access
provider America Online said that it would buy entertainment
conglomerate Time Warner, the two companies' combined stock
market value was $290 billion. Today, AOL Time Warner's stock is
worth $86 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Here is AOL Time Warner's breakdown of its goodwill losses:</TE>
<TE>Business line                   Amount of loss (in billions)</TE>
<TE>Cable business                  $23.0</TE>
<TE>Networks (includes Turner,
HBO and the WB network)          13.1</TE>
<TE>Publishing                        9.3</TE>

<HD>CalPERS' Worst-Run List Adds Tech Firms</HD>
<DH>Pensions: Gateway and Lucent are among those the fund says
have lagged rivals, had poor returns or lack oversight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pension fund giant CalPERS on Wednesday named some of the biggest
names in technology--including Gateway Inc., Lucent Technologies Inc.
and Qwest Communications International Inc.--to its annual list of
America's worst-run companies.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Employees' Retirement System, which in the
last decade has taken on a role of watchdog on corporate governance
issues, also put communications services firm NTL Inc. and insurer
Cincinnati Financial Corp. on its list of companies it says have
lagged competitors, punished investors with poor returns or have
boards that have failed to provide independent oversight.</LD>
<LD>   The $150-billion fund said it is monitoring four other companies
for possible placement on the list. CalPERS seeks specific changes in
governance practices from the firms it targets on each year's list.</LD>
<TE>   "This list is obviously by no means exhaustive," said William
Crist, president of CalPERS' board. "These same problems are inherent
in the structures of many corporations in America."</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS said the target companies were selected from the fund's
investments in more than 1,800 firms based on stock performance,
governance practices and an analysis of how much "economic value" the
companies were generating.</TE>
<TE>   "Economic value-added" is a company's after-tax net operating
profit minus its cost of capital. By using this measure of corporate
wealth creation in conjunction with relative stock performance,
CalPERS said, it is able to pinpoint firms whose poor market
performance is due to company-specific problems, not industry woes.</TE>
<TE>   Personal computer maker Gateway made the list because it
under-performed all computer sector stock indexes and its direct
competitors last year, CalPERS said.</TE>
<TE>   The pension fund also cited recent reports that Joseph Nacchio,
chief executive of voice and data services company Qwest, had
received a $1.5-million bonus last year and a $24-million cash payout
during a time when the company was struggling amid a sharp downturn
in the telecom industry.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent, the largest telecom equipment maker, caught CalPERS'
attention by refusing to adopt a proposal to elect directors
individually rather than as a slate.</TE>
<TE>   The fund also criticized Cincinnati Financial for not having a
majority of independent directors.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Cincinnati Financial said that it considered 10 of
its 15 directors to be independent .</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Qwest declined to comment. Representatives of the
other companies could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<LD>Drug courts--treatment programs pioneered in California eight years
ago and typically lasting about a year--compel district attorneys,
cops and public defenders to set aside their adversarial roles and
cooperate to keep substance abusers clean. The courts are one of the
few criminal justice reforms that both conservative and liberal
criminal justice scholars strongly support. And they save money.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Gov. Gray Davis' Department of Alcohol and Drug
Programs released a report showing that the $15 million that
California spends on drug courts each year saves taxpayers at least
$43.4 million. Savings come from such things as keeping people out of
jail and helping parents kick drug abuse, thus keeping their children
out of foster care.</LD>
<LD>   The governor, however, does not appear to be reading his own
departments' reports. His most recent budget chops drug court funding
by more than half, to $7 million. Perhaps Davis thinks drug courts
unnecessary in the wake of Proposition 36, a measure approved by
voters in 2000 that requires judges to sentence nonviolent drug
offenders to treatment instead of prison. In fact, drug courts can do
three things that generally lenient Proposition 36 programs can't:</LD>
<TE>   * Cast a wide net. Proposition 36 bars judges from sentencing an
addict to treatment if that addict has ever sold drugs, even to a
friend. Drug court judges have no such restriction. They could decide
that a low-level drug dealer whose selling merely finances his
addiction should undergo strictly monitored treatment rather than be
given a long prison term.</TE>
<TE>   * Use tough punishments for people who respond better to sticks
than carrots. Proposition 36 bars judges from using "flash
incarcerations"--a few days in jail--to motivate recalcitrant
offenders to stay off drugs and in treatment.</TE>
<TE>   * Extend treatment programs for repeat offenders. About 30% of
people sentenced to treatment in the first six months after
Proposition 36 went into effect either failed to show up or dropped
out of programs. Under Proposition 36, a substance abuser gets three
chances at treatment. The next offense means prison or jail. But as
drug court founder Stephen Manley, a Northern California judge, puts
it, "This is where drug courts make the system work." They can deal
with "clients who are severely addicted, need close supervision
because of their criminal history to ensure public safety and have
special needs for psychiatric care as well as substance abuse
treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Davis should see the great merit in these "problem-solving
courts." Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) has asked the
Legislature to restore drug court funding. If the governor does not,
lawmakers should.</TE>

<LD>Earlier this week, when Fidel Castro played a recording of his
private conversation with Mexican President Vicente Fox and then
called Fox a liar on national television, it was like the overwrought
season finale of a particularly weird and long-running soap opera.</LD>
<LD>   For 100 years Cuba and Mexico were Latin America's most enduring
allies. The bond only grew stronger when Castro seized power 43 years
ago and found a soul mate in Mexico's PRI, a political party that
defined itself as the descendant of Latin America's oldest
revolutionary movement. Castro's latest TV tantrum came three days
after Mexico joined several other Latin American members of the
United Nations' Human Rights Commission and criticized Cuba's rights
record. But Castro's grudge against Mexico's president dates to July
2000, when voters threw the PRI out of office after 71 years of rule,
beginning a true transition to democracy.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called revolution, which had devolved into corruption and
venality, died then. Suddenly labor unions were no longer forced to
belong to the "party of the revolution." With Fox as president,
Mexico opened its doors to public scrutiny. His government allowed
independent agencies to monitor human rights. Castro no doubt
shuddered. Then, characteristically, he lashed out.</LD>
<TE>   The fatigues-clad dictator is messianic, always bent on absolutes.
"Patria o muerte" is his motto, fatherland or death. When the Soviet
Union started planting missiles on his island and America threatened
to attack, Castro's message to Premier Nikita Khrushchev was: Go
ahead and push the button. He was ready to consign the world to
mushroom clouds if the U.S. wouldn't back down.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't changed. By picking a fight with Mexico, he is trying to
persuade Cubans that their own revolution lives on. He hopes to force
a vow of faith to himself and the revolution. He wants it known that
political change, Mexican style, is not an option for Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   But while Cuba hasn't changed, Mexico has, and Mexicans are
reacting in interesting ways to Castro's latest histrionics. Polls
show, for instance, that most Mexicans are angry with Castro for
betraying Fox's confidence. More significantly, for the first time
people who once viewed Castro with great sympathy, as the charismatic
leader who stood up to the gringos, now call him a dictator.</TE>
<TE>   That role, of course, has given Castro the longevity of a soap
opera star. Still, it's only a matter of time before Cubans tire of
his antics, realize that the revolution is over and declare, eforeViva la
democracia!</TE>

<LD>Karen Hughes' announcement that she is stepping down as counselor to
President Bush attracted the kind of publicity she has never sought.
Implacable and loyal, she has totally subordinated herself to Bush.
Until now.</LD>
<LD>   Disliking Washington life, her family pushing for a return to
Texas, she's leaving her full-time post. She might be the only
political appointee who was ever truthful about quitting for home and
family. But in the short time she has been in government, Hughes'
biggest accomplishment may have been to crack the barrier to women at
the innermost circle of the White House. Hughes, you might say, has
been the Bush team's Hillary Clinton.</LD>
<LD>   Like Hillary Clinton, Hughes was the most trusted advisor to the
president. The staff was terrified of her. The press corps called her
Nurse Ratched, after the ferocious head nurse in "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest." She championed women and working mothers. There the
similarities end. Clinton created a furor by appearing to work as a
semi-president; Hughes was scarcely visible in an administration that
strives for a CEO-like chain of command.</LD>
<TE>   Hughes' fingerprints on the administration start with its
spin-control operation. Press spokesman Ari Fleischer is her protege.
Bush's major speeches, from his post-9/11 speech to his State of the
Union address, were relentlessly gone over by Hughes to boil
complicated ideas down to plain speaking. Small wonder that Bush
chose her to write his campaign biography, "A Charge to Keep."</TE>
<TE>   But now Hughes' declaration that she is going to look after her
own charges, chiefly her 15-year-old-son, has created a lot of
tongue-wagging over whether working mothers really can have family
and hearth.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that Hughes' pressure-cooker job doesn't resemble the
average working mom's predicament. The White House, where
presidential aides are expected to work 30-hour days, is not a
family-friendly environment. The surprising thing isn't that Hughes
bailed out, but that, after two years of campaigning, she didn't do
so sooner. And she isn't exactly cutting all ties.</TE>
<TE>   What Hughes' departure does is to reveal a White House subject to
the intrigue that has always characterized Washington. Will Fleischer
gain power or be edged out now that his patron is leaving? How far
will Karl Rove, Hughes' more conservative nemesis in the
administration, ascend? How will the president himself cope without
Hughes to keep him focused? It's a tribute to Hughes that the buzz is
not what she will do outside the White House but how the White House
will cope without her.</TE>

<HD>Can We Vote 'Realitainment' Off Our Television Island?</HD>
<DH>There's no line left between news and entertainment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How long will it be before some enterprising TV network comes up with
a "reality show" based on passenger train crashes? Or a show based on
being an observer in the war-torn West Bank? Reality shows may not be
the white-hot phenomenon they were two years ago during the CBS
"Survivor" craze, but today a dozen such programs continue to
affect--or infect--both news and entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   To be sure, before there were reality shows, there was reality
itself. The dozen or so "realitainment" shows on television today
have their genesis in urban "action news," made possible by
helicopters and portable cameras in the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   The Fox program "Cops," which premiered in 1989, was a nationwide
distillation of such violent fare, although one always gets the sense
that the participants in the show--including the suspects--are
hamming it up for the camera.</LD>
<TE>   Notions of reality were pushed further in 1992 by MTV's "Real
World," which quickly put soap operas to shame; real people did real
things on camera, from fighting to loving to dying of AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   "Combat Missions" on the USA Network stars real-deal personnel
from SWAT and SEAL teams, plus Green Beret and Delta Force members,
staging violent sorties at an undisclosed desert camp.</TE>
<TE>   It's all for show, but the line between news and entertainment is
not just being crossed, it's sometimes being cross-wired.</TE>
<TE>   ABC television recently cut a deal with the Pentagon to have its
cameras tag along with soldiers, on the stipulation that the film
footage be treated as edited entertainment, not news.</TE>
<TE>   And VH1, veering far from its music-video roots, will soon be
offering "Military Diaries."</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, why watch someone's fictional story when you can
watch someone's real life?</TE>
<TE>   That's the premise behind ABC's "The Bachelor," the new king of
Monday night, featuring a man dating and choosing his way through a
bevy of women.</TE>
<TE>   And for more family-oriented viewers, there's "The Osbournes" on
MTV. The home life of the former Black Sabbath rocker and bat-head
biter-offer Ozzy Osbourne, now doddering and drooling his way through
prematurely drug-induced dotage, has become one of the greatest
successes in cable history; a record 6.3 million people tuned in last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Are such lives not real enough? There's always genuine death:
HBO's "America Undercover" series recently offered an episode titled
"Autopsy."</TE>
<TE>   Does any of this realitainment have larger social significance?
You bet it does, for two reasons.</TE>
<TE>   First, the old wisdom that bad news breeds escapism has been
eclipsed by a new rule: People want to see the world head-on, without
escaping at all.</TE>
<TE>   News, especially cable news, puts less premium on production
values and more emphasis on rolling out instantaneous imagery,
ranging from a Vatican press conference to a high-speed car chase.
And so the stand-up report is being supplanted by the hand-held raw
feed.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, CNN's Jason Bellini, who in the past has
partnered with MTV to produce war coverage from Afghanistan, was
there, Handycam transmitting, when a suicide bomber blew up in
Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Some might decry this unedited journalism, but if American
networks hold back, other networks, such as the Arab Al Jazeera, will
charge ahead, showing its audience what it wishes. Are you ready for
all Osama all the time?</TE>
<TE>   The second realitainment trend is that people don't just want to
consume news; they want to create it too.</TE>
<TE>   The Independent Media Center, which claims outposts on six
continents, will Webcast just about anything of a radical nature on
its site.</TE>
<TE>   As broadband technology improves, IMC is likely to progress from a
virtual to an actual network.</TE>
<TE>   And if that's too structured for you, there are thousands--soon,
millions--of Webcams up and running, showing everything from pandas
to porn.</TE>
<TE>   These two trends--ever-grittier nonescapism and unmediated
do-it-yourselfism--are likely to continue the escalation of produced
sensationalism. How else will the ratings-hungry eat? Indeed, one can
squint at various shows--pro-wrestling, pay-per-view "Ultimate
Fighting," celebrity boxing matches--and see some sort of deadly
gladiatorial combat coming into view. Will it be news or
entertainment?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that distinction will be moot, because if someone gets
killed, however entertainingly, that's news.</TE>

<HD>Broaden U.N. Jenin Inquiry to Include Palestinians</HD>
<DH>Allegations of war crimes by both sides should be
investigated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER REICH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has announced that he
will send a commission to investigate whether Israel carried out a
massacre and committed war crimes during its recent incursion into
the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank.</LD>
<LD>   Israel, which vehemently denies the allegation, has agreed to an
investigation that it believes would clear it--so long as the
investigators are unprejudiced and competent. None of the three
persons originally named by Annan has a military background, which
Israeli officials feel is required to understand urban warfare,
though it's possible that a military member or advisor will be added.</LD>
<LD>   One of those named, Cornelio Sommaruga--until recently the head of
the International Committee of the Red Cross--once refused to
recognize the Shield of David as an official symbol, saying that if
the Red Cross did, why not also accept the swastika? Understandably,
against the U.N.'s long history of hostility toward Israel, none of
this inspires confidence among Israelis that the commission will be
fair.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Israel's confidence and the U.N.'s credibility as a neutral
judge could be bolstered immensely if, simultaneous with its
investigation of Palestinian allegations about Jenin, the U.N. would
investigate the precise role of the Palestinian Authority in the
suicide bombings that have massacred Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   In carrying out such a parallel investigation, the U.N. could
eliminate the main stumbling block to restarting a negotiating
process that could actually lead to peace.</TE>
<TE>   By now the evidence is abundant that at least some of the suicide
killings, perhaps most, were organized and launched by organizations
associated with the Palestinian Authority as part of a strategic
military policy.</TE>
<TE>   Though such killings of civilians are war crimes, Palestinian
defenders have argued that the Palestinian Authority isn't a state
and therefore can't be held to the same standard as Israel. They've
added that the suicide bombings are the work of individuals, and
international conventions apply only to states.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority appears to want it both ways: It's a
state when it claims to represent the Palestinians, and it's not a
state when it claims to have no control over suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   This is a dead-end problem for diplomacy because, so long as the
Palestinian Authority maintains this stance, there's no reason for
Israel to negotiate with it.</TE>
<TE>   Israel isn't threatened by Palestinian tanks. It's threatened by
the suicide massacres of its people. It simply can't live with 20 or
30 civilians being blown up every week or every day with no end in
sight.</TE>
<TE>   And if the Palestinian Authority claims it has no control over
that threat, then what's the point of negotiating with it?</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the suicide bombings are central not only to the
immediate crisis but also to the long-term prospect of being able to
end this conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the U.N. has a duty to conduct a simultaneous investigation
into the role of the Palestinian Authority in the campaign of suicide
bombings over which it has claimed to have no control.</TE>
<TE>   Such an investigation would be diplomatically right because it
could end the Palestinian pretense that is the main stumbling block
to future negotiations. And it would be morally right because the
allegation of war crimes by any party must be investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Such a simultaneous investigation would be the honest thing for
the United Nations to do. The U.N.'s challenge is to show that it has
the honesty to do it.</TE>

<LD>I can't believe that Cardinal Bernard Law still thinks that he did
the "right" thing by covering up some of the identified sex abusers
and refuses to resign ("Key U.S. Clerics Plan to Push for Law's
Removal," April 22). How will the Catholic Church get this scandal
under control if the people who did wrong are still inside the
church?</LD>
<LD>   As a Catholic I can accept the mistakes of those abusers and maybe
even forgive them, but they have to be punished, not moved around in
society as if they didn't do anything wrong.</LD>
<LD>   And of all the people, the bishop, as one of the higher rank in
the church, should know what is right and what is wrong. The
parishioners need church officials whom they can trust and look up to
as role models. I think the biggest problem with this scandal is the
cover-up, which makes the church a haven for these sex abusers. This
has to stop.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Anger Greets Church Picketers," April 22: Mary Grant, a lead
protester and survivor of a priest's molestation, correctly states,
"Sadly, this has been the posture of the church . . . to treat us as
the enemy. If they blame the victim, then they don't have to take
responsibility." I would go one step further and say that a huge
number of churchgoers don't take responsibility for many things in
their lives precisely because they don't have to; because they
believe in some outside deity. As an agnostic, I do my best to take
responsibility and be accountable for all of my actions.</TE>

<TE>   I found your April 23 article, "U.S. Catholics and Vatican Face a
Cultural Chasm," to be on the mark. As a practicing Catholic I would
like to make these observations. A priest who engages in child abuse
or child seduction is guilty of a crime as defined by our society,
and as a member of this society is answerable for his actions. A
priest who violates his vows by engaging in an affair either
heterosexual or homosexual with a consenting adult has not broken any
civil laws and may be subject to church discipline but not criminal
prosecution. The Catholic Church must be able to treat these two
actions separately.</TE>
<TE>   As a former public school teacher I was obliged by law to report
immediately any suspected incident of child abuse to the civil
authorities; i.e., child protective services, law enforcement
officials, etc. Church members who are responsible for the spiritual
growth of children must do the same.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Judge Limits Hikes in Formerly Subsidized Rents," April 19: Now
that U.S. District Judge George H. King has told landlords they can't
back out of federally subsidized apartment programs, even when the
required time period to stay in the program has passed, there is no
longer any incentive for future developers to build any new
low-income housing. After all, what developer in his right mind would
want to deal with a lot of government red tape and often-difficult
tenants when the government continues to change the rules in the
middle of the contract? This means the owners can't make the
reasonable profit they expected to make when they entered into the
contract with the federal government 20 years ago, since the
government won't allow owners to rent their private property, as
promised, at current fair-market rental rates.</LD>
<LD>   Court decisions like this send the message to people already
living in subsidized housing that they should stay there until the
day they die so they can continue avoiding paying fair-market rents.
This decision also sends the message that if you're not currently
living in subsidized housing, don't count on any subsidized housing
to be built in the future.</LD>

<LD>Re "Time Is Running Out for Thousands on Welfare," April 20:
Fortunately, there are few other countries in the world where we
would read about a 38-year-old single mother of four who claims she
"never worked a day in my life." Then, in spite of being given
employment in 1999, she chose to quit and return to collecting
welfare.</LD>
<LD>   For too long have we fanned the flames of indolence by paying the
able-bodied for doing nothing except bearing children. Welfare's
original intent of helping people who needed it until they could get
back on their feet will now become unavailable to those who would not
have abused it.</LD>

<LD>Re "Tighter Purse for Air Safety," editorial, April 21: Air safety
has become a major issue after Sept. 11. Its importance is so huge
that Congress has given the Transportation Security Administration
more than $6 billion to spend on upgrading safety in airports.
High-tech equipment is one of the resolutions that the TSA is
considering, and why shouldn't it; after all, it does have $6 billion
in spending cash.</LD>
<LD>   Yet there is some practical reasoning that can be used for tighter
air security. A few weeks ago I found myself at LAX stunned by the
fact that baggage checking was done randomly right before boarding an
airplane. Wouldn't it make more sense to check everyone? What's the
point in checking my baggage, patting me and asking me to take off my
shoes if the person behind me isn't going to be getting the same
treatment?</LD>

read your article does not decide to challenge a National Guard
soldier stationed at an airport, because then the public will find
out the truth about our equipment. You did your country a real
disservice with that article.</TE>

commentary to discover in the last paragraph what I thought was

<LD>Re "Far-Rightist Le Pen Is Mighty in France," April 22: Before we are
inundated with lamentations about the second-place showing of
rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen in the first round of the French election
for president, permit me to give a little of the other side.</LD>
<LD>   The French were given a terrible set of 16 candidates. Three were
Trotskyites. Where but in France could this happen? And Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin is an ex-Trotskyite. He is also a cold, Red
Protestant, thus very un-French. Jacques Chirac, the incumbent, is a
crook but at least a Catholic, thus a bona fide Frenchman.</LD>
<LD>   The French are most appalled by the activities of what I would
call Islamo-Bolsheviks. The attacks by Muslims on Jews and synagogues
were appalling to the French, even if most of them don't give a fig
for Israel or for Jews. But Muslim violence, both political and
criminal, is a threat to French identity. Immigration is a real issue
and Le Pen is a sort of French Pat Buchanan. One can deplore
populist, anti-immigrant voters, but excessive immigration can pose a
threat to national identity in this country as well as in France. To
fear immigrants does not make one a fascist. Leftists always call
their opponents fascists.</LD>

<TE>   Isn't it interesting that when reporting the elections in France,
The Times refers to Le Pen as the "far-right" or "extremist"
candidate. I noticed that you did not refer to the socialist
candidate as the "far-left extremist" candidate. Perhaps your paper
could work on confining your bias to the opinion pages. I'm not
holding my breath.</TE>

<TE>   Le Pen pulled an electoral upset in France because he opposes the
leftist policies that have flooded his country with Third World
immigrants who drain the economy and contribute mightily to the
explosive crime rate in that country. Perhaps there is a lesson for
us here. Vive Le Pen!</TE>

<TE>   While your April 23 article ("Europe's Drift to the Right Is Seen
as a Wake-Up Call for Democracy") is sobering, we also have a "rise
of right-wing nationalists who are playing on voters' fears of crime,
unemployment and immigration." These right-wingers seem to have taken
over the Republican Party and are presently exerting undue influence
in the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe you need to do a parallel article on the development of this
phenomenon in the United States. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft is only the
most visible of this extremely conservative group. There seems to be
a frightening abandonment of American democratic principles and
institutions. I think our drift to the right is also a wake-up call
for our democracy.</TE>

<HD>Clarify Bush Doctrine on Global Terrorism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An outcome of the tragic events of Sept. 11 that has far-reaching
ramifications is the declaration of what has become known as the
"Bush doctrine." Its message is that "anyone or any state that
harbors terrorists are terrorists." It is a logical approach;
however, we must be careful in its application.</LD>
<LD>   The long-range consequence of adhering to the doctrine in the
strict sense is the danger of establishing perpetual warfare.
Indiscriminate use can lead to chaos. We should be wary of the use of
out-of-control violence to overcome terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   There must be a meaningful clarification of the doctrine's intent
and implementation. It is time for the American people to think
intelligently with a clear vision of how best to achieve peace. As a
major player in global affairs, America has the responsibility to get
it straight.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Herve Denis, 62, a former culture minister in Haiti and the country's
most prominent man of theater, died Sunday of cancer in
Port-Au-Prince.</LD>
<LD>   Denis had been active as actor and director in avant-garde theater
productions in France in the l970s.</LD>
<LD>   An economist by profession, he returned to his homeland in the
early 1980s. Arrested by the secret police of dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier, he was beaten and released after several days in detention.</LD>
<TE>   After a popular uprising ousted Duvalier in 1986, Denis divided
his time between teaching high school and directing a theater troupe.</TE>
<TE>   From 1993 to 1995, Denis was culture and communication minister
under President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in exile in the United States
during the 1991-94 period of military-backed rule. Denis joined
Aristide in exile several months before U.S. intervention restored
Aristide to power in September 1994, and returned with him to their
homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Rene Preval, who succeeded Aristide in 1996,
twice nominated Denis to be premier but the Haitian Parliament, in a
power struggle with Preval, refused to confirm his choice.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wayne Hightower, one of the highest profile players to jump from the
NBA to the American Basketball Assn., has died. He was 62.</LD>
<LD>   Hightower died of a heart attack at his home in West Philadelphia
on April 18.</LD>
<LD>   A thin, 6-foot-8 forward, Hightower was a first-round draft pick
of the Philadelphia Warriors in 1962.</LD>
<TE>   Hightower followed Wilt Chamberlain as the big man for Overbrook
High School in Philadelphia, leading the school to consecutive city
titles in 1957 and '58.</TE>
<TE>   A tenacious rebounder, Hightower followed Chamberlain to the
University of Kansas, where he averaged 21.3 points and 10.8 rebounds
in two seasons (1960-61). He finished his college career with 1,128
points.</TE>
<TE>   Hightower was selected fifth overall in the 1962 NBA draft by the
Warriors, who moved to San Francisco before his first season. He
averaged 13.2 points during the 1962-63 season.</TE>
<TE>   Hightower was traded to the Baltimore Bullets during the 1964-65
season. After two seasons, he jumped to the Denver Rockets of the
ABA, giving some credibility to the newly created league.</TE>
<TE>   Hightower played five seasons in the ABA with Denver, Los Angeles,
Utah, Texas and Carolina before retiring after the 1971-72 season.</TE>
<TE>   Hightower is survived by a daughter, Paula; sons Wayne Jr. and

<HD>Alan Dale, 75; Pop Singer Hosted Early TV Variety Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alan Dale, one of the more promising crooners of the late 1940s and
'50s, whose hits included "Heart of My Heart" and "Cherry Pink and
Apple Blossom White," has died. He was 75. Dale died Saturday in New
York after a long illness, family spokesman Michael Gregorio told the
Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   Born Aldo Sigismondi in Brooklyn, he had his own television
variety show, "The Alan Dale Show," which was set in a record shop,
for the Dumont TV network beginning in 1948.</LD>
<LD>   In 1950, the show moved to CBS, where it thrived until 1951,
featuring guest singers and comedians as well as Dale's work.</LD>
<TE>   The singer also hosted a weekly network radio show.</TE>
<TE>   Before rock 'n' roll burst on the scene, Dale had his first hit
recording with "Kate (Have I Come Too Early, Too Late)" with Ray
Bloch and His Orchestra in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Dale and Connie Haines found success with their
recording of "At the Darktown Strutters' Ball." Among Dale's other
hits were "Oh, Marie," "Sweet and Gentle" and, in 1955, "Cherry Pink
and Apple Blossom White," which stayed on the charts for 30 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   A year later came "Heart of My Hearts." In 1956, Dale also made
his feature film acting debut with "Don't Knock the Rock" starring
Bill Haley and the Comets. But films were never to be Dale's forte.</TE>
<TE>   Popular in such well-known clubs as the Copacabana, Dale had a
successful nightclub schedule through the 1960s and '70s. His career
wound down after that.</TE>
<TE>   Dale is survived by his wife, Hedy.</TE>

<HD>Pilots Give Safe Harbor to Behemoths of Sea</HD>
<DH>Shoals and shallows, uncertain winds and tricky turns all
can play havoc with a ship being steered through the port.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will Baumann has sailed through Angels Gate straight into hell.
During a storm a few years ago, he rode a small boat beyond the
breakwater entrance of Los Angeles Harbor to meet an arriving
900-foot container ship.</LD>
<LD>   His job was to climb aboard the larger vessel--up a towering rope
ladder--and navigate it safely through Angels Gate to the terminal,
where it would unload.</LD>
<LD>   "I watched that ship roll and pitch like a toy," Baumann recalled.
"It was late at night, and it was actually kind of awe-inspiring to
watch something that huge roll around like that in the sea lane."</LD>
<TE>   The rope ladder is a daily tool of the port pilots who work around
the clock to direct ships in and out of Angels Gate, the historic
harbor entrance created more than 90 years ago. Baumann remembers how
difficult it was to time his ascent in such enormous swells. With
each upward heave of the 80,000-ton Evergreen ship, the bottom of the
ladder became too high to reach. Each downward roll caused the ladder
to dip underwater.</TE>
<TE>   "The boat operator looked at me," said Baumann, who managed to
take hold and clamber up anyway, "and his eyes were kind of bugging
out."</TE>
<TE>   Port pilots are mandated for any ship larger than 300 tons--the
size of a 100-foot yacht or fishing boat--as it moves inside Angels
Gate. The harbor is not to be navigated without special training. Too
many dangers exist, particularly for modern freighters that are twice
as big as they were in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Port pilots have to know the depths and dimensions of a harbor as
complex as a Cubist painting. The breakwater runs east-west. Angels
Gate is a gap in the rocks a third of a mile wide. Like an invisible
highway, the main channel runs through Angels Gate at a depth of 83
feet, angling west as it moves toward the cargo terminals.</TE>
<TE>   Veer from it and there are hazards--shoals and shallows preserved
for wildlife. The channel is marked at first by buoys and then by
fishing docks, container cranes and cruise berths. It angles and
branches into small channels and turning basins that reach four miles
inland.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen port pilots are employed by the city of Los Angeles.
Each one had to draw a detailed chart of the harbor from memory to
pass the test, said Michael Rubino, one of the two chief pilots.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be in the [shipping] business at least a decade to be
a pilot, typically," Rubino said.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots know to enter Angels Gate at an angle to stay in line with
the channel and avoid having to make a hard left turn. They also have
to understand the complex physics of steering a massive floating
object. They have to consider the draft of the ship--how far it
extends below the surface--in relation to the depth of the channel.
The keel of some gigantic freighters glides within a few feet of the
harbor bottom, a fact that can influence how sharply a ship turns.</TE>
<TE>   Wind can move a ship sideways at 2 or 3 knots. The bow may move
one direction while the stern swings the other. The pivot point can
be anywhere along the hull. There is high art, pilots say, in keeping
an entire vessel in line and controlling its momentum.</TE>
<TE>   At very slow speeds, a rudder becomes nearly useless. Tugboats are
often needed to help stop, start or maneuver a ship near the dock.</TE>
<TE>   "Every generation of ship effectively reduces the margin for
error," Baumann said, citing places in the harbor where today's ships
cannot even turn around. They have to be towed backward nearly a mile
before the bow can be swung toward Angels Gate.</TE>
<TE>   While leaving the harbor, pilots sometimes must allow room for
another freighter coming in. Baumann credits early designers of the
harbor for being prescient in making the entrance as large as it is.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the breakwater began in the early years of the
20th century as Los Angeles grew into a young metropolis. Two cities,
San Pedro and Santa Monica, competed to become the official harbor.
The selection of San Pedro fundamentally shaped the face of the city,
influencing the flow of billions of dollars of goods and capital in
all the years that followed.</TE>
<TE>   Breakwater rocks were initially barged in from Catalina Island,
but those were too porous in the judgment of the Army Corps of
Engineers, which built the harbor, said William Lee, director of the
Los Angeles Maritime Museum. Later, loads were trucked in from
quarries near San Bernardino and Chatsworth. A lighthouse was added
in 1911.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II, the breakwater was extended, and a second
entrance, now called Queen's Gate, was created at the neighboring
Port of Long Beach. The two gates feed the nation's busiest harbor
complex. Each entry accommodates nearly 3,000 freighters and oil
tankers a year, plus a greater number of commercial fishing boats,
tugs, ferries, yachts, sloops and other craft.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic is regulated by the Marine Exchange, a private, nonprofit
arm of the shipping industry. From a lookout post at Angels Gate
Park, high above Los Angeles Harbor, specialists use radar and
sophisticated charting equipment to plot the position and course of
ships within a 25-mile arc of the two harbors. Information is relayed
by radio to captains and dispatchers at each harbor's port pilot
station.</TE>
<TE>   Inbound ships are told where to pick up a port pilot and on which
side to drop the ladder.</TE>
<TE>   Departing ships also carry a port pilot. The pilot boards at the
dock and disembarks down the ladder once the ship is clear of the
harbor.</TE>
<TE>   The ship never stops. Instead, the 52-foot pilot boat presses
itself to the hull of the bigger vessel, held fast by the force of
its engines and a cushion of old tires. The pilot either gets down
the ladder or finds himself in some distant port.</TE>
<TE>   Rubino, a 15-year veteran, nearly took an unplanned voyage to San
Francisco during a violent storm in 1987. No one can remember a port
pilot being killed in Los Angeles, generally a fair-weather haven,
but everyone fears losing his grip on the ladder. It happens with
some regularity in rainy northern ports: a man being crushed between
the pilot boat and the hull of a cargo ship.</TE>
<TE>   "One slip," said Rubino, "and you're a dead man."</TE>

<LD>Now it makes sense. I understand how one of the most admirable people
in the sports world could also be one of the most deplorable. How a
man of such strength could succumb to moments of weakness.</LD>
<LD>   All of the answers are there in Spike Lee's documentary "Jim
Brown: All-American." It's a complete look at a man who can't simply
be summarized as a football legend. Actor, community leader and
activist are among the roles he has played in what feels like three
lifetimes.</LD>
<LD>   Brown has impressed me as much as anyone I've met. He has a quiet
intelligence. He doesn't need to shout his opinions, he simply lays
them out and lets the words and logic carry their own weight. He uses
his fame and money for good, reaching out to make things better for
those who have it worse. He invites gangsters to be productive
members of society.</LD>
<TE>   But his path never stayed on the high ground because of a history
of violence toward women. He faced various assault and/or battery
charges against women four times between 1965 and 1985--he wasn't
found guilty of any of them. He is serving a six-month sentence in
the Ventura County Jail on a misdemeanor vandalism conviction for
smashing the windows of his wife's car during a 1999 argument.</TE>
<TE>   Lee throws the good and the bad into the film, which ran 2 hours
10 minutes in the version that was screened in Los Angeles last week.
It will be reedited and shown on HBO in December.</TE>
<TE>   "People are going to make up their own minds no matter what," Lee
said. "But at least the more information you have, the more
intelligent assessment you can make of a human being."</TE>
<TE>   You could almost predict some of the pitfalls that awaited Brown
later in life when you learn of his early days. His mother wasn't
around for his childhood in St. Simons Island, Ga., where he was
raised by his great-grandmother and grandmother. His father popped
into his life only occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   He lived with his mother while he attended Manhasset (N.Y.) High.
His high school coach described scenes of Brown sitting in the corner
while his mother and father had loud arguments in the living room.</TE>
<TE>   He never saw his parents adhere to the most basic of adult
responsibilities--raising their children. His only model of a
relationship was dysfunctional.</TE>
<TE>   I also wonder how much of Brown's persona is a result of the sport
he played and the expectations it carries.</TE>
<TE>   The dominant theme running through the documentary is "manhood."</TE>
<TE>   You see it in the football highlights, where Brown simply refuses
to be tackled, as if his pride wouldn't allow it. You see it in the
movie clips, where Brown shoots guns and has his way with women.</TE>
<TE>   Brown is beyond old school. He's old campus.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim Brown comes from a different era," Lee said. "A different era
of black men, a different era of a black athlete. These were the
brothers that had to go through segregation, had to go to different
hotels. Jim Crow. The time when a brother could get lynched for just
looking at a white woman the wrong way. It was a very different time.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't make black men like Jim Brown. I'm talking about the
mythic ... Jack Johnson. John Henry, the steel-driving man with the
hammer in his hand. They ain't got that."</TE>
<TE>   If the men have changed, that's because they adapted to the rules
governing them. The rugged stuff isn't accepted. Smacking a woman
just isn't something that men do anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back on his career, Brown boiled a man's attitude down to
this: "Men deal with physicality. The bottom line with a man is, 'I
can kick your ass.'"</TE>
<TE>   It's mental as much as it is physical. One teammate recalls an
instance of Brown slipping on a patch of ice outside a restaurant and
then struggling to stay upright by sheer will, refusing to abide by
the laws of gravity.</TE>
<TE>   Former Cleveland Brown Paul Warfield talked about how Brown played
the game with "intellect."</TE>
<TE>   "Jim is a very fierce individualist," Warfield said in an
interview. "He believes in the things he does. There have been times
when they've been contrary to the norms of society. He has always
reveled in the fact that he is more than an individual who will
accept his responsibility. I think he has done that.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been some instances that have been unfavorable in
which he cannot be supported. But he stands up to be counted, he
stands up to whatever he has to face."</TE>
<TE>   It's this determination to go down fighting that has Brown in jail
now. Once again, the manhood came before all else. He was offered
domestic violence counseling, 40 hours of clean-up or 400 hours of
community service, but he decided to do the time instead. He told Bob
Costas on HBO's "On the Record" that he turned down the alternatives
"Because it's not just. If I had taken that, it would be the biggest
sellout on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, through his wife and his attorney, declined to be
interviewed for this story.</TE>
<TE>   His circle maintains that there are greater forces and
conspiracies at work here.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a political case," said Brown's wife, Monique. "They used
it, they used us. They exploited it."</TE>
<TE>   Bo Taylor, who runs a gang intervention program that has benefited
immensely from Brown's help, said: "Being from the neighborhood, I
know guys that don't go to jail all the time for doing something
similar. If it's going to be vandalism, you don't just go to jail for
vandalism for 4-6 months. First-time offenders never go to jail. But
this case was different....</TE>
<TE>   "They're just utilizing Jim as a tool to get some of their hidden
agendas out, so that they can start mass incarcerations. If it
happens in the black community and it happens in the white community,
will they be doing the same thing?"</TE>
<TE>   Post-Rampart scandal, anything is a fair question. And an
outspoken black man will be marked. In the film, Brown holds up the
FBI file on him he obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.</TE>
<TE>   But how much of Brown's current plight is an inevitable result of
his background and attitude, his own choices?</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the greatest titans stumble over the debris they scatter
through the course of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Brown hasn't been able to shake the story that he threw a woman
off the balcony of his home in 1968. In a compelling stretch of the
documentary, Brown and Eva Marie Bohn-Chin give their versions of
that night.</TE>
<TE>   It still isn't clarified. Brown says she jumped off the balcony to
"protect" him as the police were arriving to respond to neighbors'
calls about a loud argument. Bohn-Chin doesn't specify what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "He came towards me--maybe he wanted to hurt me or whatever --and
I found myself in the hospital the next day," said Bohn-Chin, who
suffered a separated shoulder and bruises to her head.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a young, good-looking person who loved life. Why should I
jump?"</TE>
<TE>   Why would anybody do something so contrary to what they stand for?</TE>
<TE>   That's the great mystery of Jim Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of at-risk youths have straightened out their lives because
of his Amer-I-Can program, but he couldn't play the role of father
for his own kids.</TE>
<TE>   In the film, his daughter Kim says: "I wanted to be daddy's little
girl ... and he wasn't there." His son Kevin can recall his father
hugging him once in more than 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   Brown says he didn't realize his parental inadequacies until he
saw the film the first time. He pledges to get it right this time
with his new son Aris, who was born in November. But by spending six
months in jail while his son is at the age when every day brings
growth, he's missing out on time that can never be recaptured. By the
time he is released he will have been incarcerated for two-thirds of
his son's life.</TE>
<TE>   Even at 66, there are still glimmers of hope for Brown, the chance
for progress. He finally is making promises not to raise his hand in
anger toward anyone. That would make him complete, no more apologies
required, no more balancing acts.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, how do you reconcile the two sides of Jim Brown?</TE>
<TE>   "You don't," said Rosey Grier, the minister, former football
player and Brown's longtime friend. "That's a whole person. You have
to accept the whole person or reject the whole person. You can't say,
'I like this part, I don't like that part.' We all make mistakes.
It's not a thing about the good outweighs the bad, or whatever.
You're a complete person. You have human frailties. We all do. What
you do, you accept the person that he is. We are told in the Bible
not to judge. I am not the judge."</TE>
<TE>   I thought about the movie's title again, saw the similarity in
both elements: "Jim Brown: All-American."</TE>
<TE>   If you're at all patriotic, you learned to live with conflict long
ago. We pledge allegiance to a country that stomped on the Indians,
included slavery in its original constitution, denied women the right
to vote for more than half its existence and, to date, remains the
only nation to carry out a nuclear attack. Yet we love it because it
offers more freedom and opportunity than any other place on earth,
because Americans tend to see the good in people and in our country
and hope for the best.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Lee's film concludes with the only ending that makes
sense, with a former high school teammate, now a reverend, saying a
prayer for Jim Brown.</TE>

<LD>Rafael Palmeiro hit his 452nd career homer and Kenny Rogers pitched
seven solid innings, leading the Texas Rangers past the Toronto Blue
Jays, 3-2, Wednesday night at Arlington, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   "It wasn't much hitting, but just enough," Palmeiro said.</LD>
<LD>   After Rogers (2-0) gave up a homer to Raul Mondesi in the first,
Palmeiro hit a two-out, two-run homer in the bottom half to put the
Rangers ahead to stay.</LD>
<TE>   Palmeiro tied Carl Yastrzemski for 25th on the career home run
list. He extended his hitting streak to eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers gave up two runs and five hits in seven innings. He struck
out six and walked one.</TE>

Albie Lopez beat Baltimore on April 13, 2001--a span of 170 games, a
major league record.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Hal McRae defended the move, saying the Devil Rays "are
not at that stage where we're concerned with a complete game or we're
concerned with a shutout."</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 5, Boston 3--Rodrigo Lopez, making his first start in
the majors in two years, gave up two runs and eight hits in 51/3
innings at Baltimore and Tony Batista had three hits for the Orioles,
who have won four of five.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 9, Cleveland 2--Dan Wright (2-2) outpitched C.C. Sabathia,
Magglio Ordonez hit a two-run homer and Paul Konerko homered, helping
the White Sox improved to 5-1 against the Indians this season.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago's Frank Thomas hit his first triple since 1998 in a
three-run ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 8, Detroit 2--Brent Mayne scored on a violent
collision at the plate, and Neifi Perez drove in three runs at Kansas
City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Mayne scored in the sixth inning after crashing into catcher Mike
Rivera and knocking the ball loose.</TE>
<TE>   When Mayne, a catcher, came to bat two innings later, he and
Rivera slapped each other on the back. Rivera said he had no hard
feelings.</TE>
<TE>   New York 8, Oakland 5--Jason Giambi, who left Oakland for the
Yankees in the off-season, hit a go-ahead, two-run double in the
seventh inning at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The record crowd of 54,513 at the Coliseum loudly booed throughout
Giambi's first at-bat. He answered with a run-scoring single in the
first.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Jeter hit a three-run homer for the Yankees, who blew a 5-0
lead.</TE>

<HD>Scioscia's Shake-Up Works</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Manager's moves, which include putting Palmeiro
third in batting order, lead to offensive outburst and a 10-6 victory
at Seattle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Play by the proverbial book, and no one questions the manager. The
team might not win, but no one second-guesses a manager who plays by
the conventional wisdom.</LD>
<LD>   With the Angels off to their worst start in franchise history,
Manager Mike Scioscia tossed the book out the proverbial window
Wednesday. Batting third for the Angels: Orlando Palmeiro, an
accomplished leadoff hitter and pinch-hitter with three home runs in
1,228 major league at-bats.</LD>
<LD>   For a night, Scioscia was a genius. Palmeiro sparked a 10-6
victory over the Seattle Mariners with three hits and two runs
scored. Tim Salmon hit his first home run of the season, Scott
Spiezio tied a career high with four runs batted in, and Jarrod
Washburn shut out the highest-scoring team in the major leagues over
the first five innings, as the Angels ended a four-game losing streak
overall and an eight-game losing streak to the Mariners.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm pretty accustomed to getting my butt kicked this year,"
Garret Anderson said. "It's definitely nice to be on the other side."</TE>
<TE>   In spring training, Scioscia preached the virtues of a set lineup.
With the Angels scoring the fewest runs of any team in the majors,
Scioscia used a different lineup for the 12th consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   "We have so many guys who aren't swinging the bat well that it's
difficult to find the recipe," Scioscia said. "It's like you're
trying to make bread without yeast and water."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels posted season highs in runs and hits. The 16 hits
included four from Bengie Molina, tying his career high, and three
apiece from Palmeiro, Anderson and Troy Glaus. In determining his
lineup, Scioscia ignored traditional roles and simply put the hot
hitters at the top.</TE>
<TE>   The hottest hitter is Palmeiro, filling in superbly on offense and
defense for injured outfielder Darin Erstad. In the past four games,
Palmeiro has collected eight hits--all singles--and scored five runs.
He is batting .375 this season.</TE>
<TE>   Palmeiro, who batted third for the first time in his career, said
he did not feel particularly comfortable at bat despite his heroics.</TE>
<TE>   "I never feel comfortable," he said. "I don't know if anyone does.
Maybe Barry Bonds does."</TE>
<TE>   But Washburn, the winning pitcher in both victories of the Angels'
2-5 trip, said Palmeiro is the kind of hitter who makes opposing
pitchers plenty uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pretty underrated," Washburn said. "I bet he averages more
pitches per at-bat than anybody in the big leagues. He gets two
strikes and fouls off about five pitches. I would never be able to
throw enough strikes to him. I'd probably walk him after 13 pitches."</TE>
<TE>   On a night the hitting sparkled, the defense and relief pitching
did not. The Angels committed three errors, including two by second
baseman Adam Kennedy. Al Levine, trusted to set up closer Troy
Percival, pitched to six batters and retired one. In his past three
outings, Levine has given up six runs over 32/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels scored five runs in the first inning, the most
productive inning this season from a team that failed to score more
than five runs in 15 of its first 20 games.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, whose 248 home runs are the most in franchise history, hit
a career-low 17 homers last season and did not homer in his first 69
at-bats this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels ended their first stretch of games within the division
with a 6-12 record, including a 3-11 mark against American League
West powers Seattle and Oakland. The Angels are 91/2 games behind
Seattle already, and none too sorry to see the Mariners disappear
from their schedule until July.</TE>
<TE>   The schedule resumes Friday, with 12 of the Angels' next 18 games
against teams with losing records, including six against the worst
team in the majors, the Detroit Tigers.</TE>

<HD>Pressler Backs Stoneman, Scioscia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>As the Angels tumble to the worst start in club history behind the
largest payroll in club history, the team's chief executive said
Wednesday he stands behind General Manager Bill Stoneman and Manager
Mike Scioscia.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got the same belief in this talent that we had in spring
training," said Paul Pressler, who oversees the Angels and Mighty
Ducks for Disney. "What it's going to take to tweak it, that's Bill's
job and Mike's job. I'm not second-guessing at this point."</LD>
<LD>   Neither Stoneman nor Scioscia is in the final season of his
contract. Pressler last year approved an extension for Scioscia
through 2005. The contract of Stoneman, hired by former club
president Tony Tavares, extends through next year.</LD>
<TE>   Pressler last week fired Pierre Gauthier, the Ducks' president and
general manager. Under Gauthier, the Ducks finished in last place in
their division in each of the past three seasons, and even then
Pressler said the decision to fire Gauthier "was a tough one."</TE>
<TE>   Pressler said he could not imagine evaluating Stoneman or Scioscia
before season's end.</TE>
<TE>   Teams with high expectations and poor results often fire the
manager, but infielder Scott Spiezio said he believed such a move
would serve no purpose for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not think that would help," he said. "It's not his fault
that we're losing. It's the players' fault.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how the game is nowadays, and that's usually the first
thing people change. In some cases, that might be OK. In this case,
it's not the way to go."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels assumed they had filled their vacancy at designated
hitter when they traded for Brad Fullmer. Sixteen players started at
least one game at DH last year, sometimes batting ninth. The DH line:
a .212 average and eight home runs.</TE>
<TE>   The DH line through 20 games this year: .174, with no homers.
Fullmer is batting .183 with two runs batted in; Scioscia benched him
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he works hard almost to a fault," Scioscia said. "I think
he maybe needs to work a little smarter on things instead of just
going out and pounding some more."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels considered Fullmer an everyday hitter despite his .202
average against left-handers last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, once content to wait for the injured Shawn Wooten to
return in another month or two, are actively searching for a
right-handed bat. They have discussed several players, including Wil
Cordero, designated for assignment by the Cleveland Indians, and
Shane Spencer of the New York Yankees. Cordero batted just 18 times
for Cleveland this season.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Cordero's 1997 guilty plea on four felony counts of spousal
abuse makes him an unlikely Disney employee, and the New York Post
reported the Yankees are not interested in trading Spencer to the
Angels for Orlando Palmeiro.</TE>
<TE>   Five days after suffering a mild concussion, outfielder Darin
Erstad was cleared Wednesday to resume workouts. If he remains free
of headaches, Scioscia said, Erstad could return to the lineup Sunday
or Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>They're on the Ball at Corona del Mar</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Brothers Cameron and Carsten make Sea Kings
formidable defending champion by following a family tradition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't Davis Cup play; it just seemed like it.</LD>
<LD>   All the requisite team effort and spirit were in evidence. Even a
banner commemorating the 1997 Davis Cup competition that took place
at Palisades Tennis Club in Newport Beach hung across the back wall
at center court.</LD>
<LD>   And on the court, locked in a battle of skill, wit and will, was
Corona del Mar High senior Cameron Ball, the son of a former
Australian Davis Cup team member.</LD>
<TE>   Ball defeated James Pade, an Atherton Menlo High senior headed to
Stanford, in a crowd-pleasing, roller-coaster ride of a match, 8-7
(1).</TE>
<TE>   The victory, coupled with the perfect record of Ball's younger
brother, Carsten, in the two-day, 16-team National High School
All-American tournament last month, helped give Corona del Mar the
title and its biggest victory of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers have loomed large for Corona del Mar (18-2), the
defending Southern Section Division V champions. The Sea Kings remain
ranked atop the division and are No. 2 in The Times' rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't be where we are without them," Coach Tim Mang said of
the brothers, who will compete in the 102nd Ojai Valley tournament
that begins today.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron, a right-hander who plays at No. 1 singles, and Carsten, a
freshman left-hander who usually plays at No. 3, are following a
family tradition of tennis success.</TE>
<TE>   Their father, Syd Ball, played on Australia's Davis Cup teams in
1974 and '76, retiring from competitive pro tennis in 1981 after a
13-year career. He is a teaching pro at Costa Mesa Tennis Center and
has been his sons' primary coach since they began competing seriously
as preteens.</TE>
<TE>   Syd sometimes invited visiting Australian touring pros to the
family's house in Newport Beach as the brothers were growing up.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron, 18, believes he and his brother gravitated to the sport
because of their early exposure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun and it was around me all the time," he said. "I did the
whole sports thing. I played baseball, basketball, soccer, but tennis
was always there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not even like a sport. It's like a life lesson, a sport and
a job at the same time. But it's a fun job."</TE>
<TE>   The Balls have worked hard at improving their games, at their
father's urging, and look forward to college scholarships and,
eventually, pro careers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to take my possibilities as far as I can," said Carsten,
14. "But there's a lot of good players out there and only a few of
them make it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Syd of his sons: "They had pretty high standards from the
word go. They know what it takes, having been around it from such a
young age. I think that helped."</TE>
<TE>   Cameron's victory over Pade was a significant step for him, one of
several lately.</TE>
<TE>   He also won a tournament title in San Diego in January, advanced
to the quarterfinals of the South Bay tournament last month, and won
the boys' 18 division backdraw--good for fifth place--in a Las Vegas
tournament last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Carston won the boys' 16 competition in Las Vegas and finished
fourth in boys' 14s at the Easter Bowl/USTA Super National Spring
Championships two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron is 29-5 in high school dual-match singles sets; Carsten
16-5.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers have contrasting playing styles.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron, 6 feet 2 and 190 pounds, is a heavy-hitting server and
excellent volleyer who attacks the net as often as possible. He
played doubles as a freshman, moved to singles as a sophomore, but
then missed five weeks last season because of mononucleosis.</TE>
<TE>   "That really put him back a lot," Syd said. "He's always trying to
get to the next level. But it's a much harder game to play and to
learn."</TE>
<TE>   Carsten, 5-8, 130 pounds, is a quick, polished player who already
has an all-court game and good technical and tactical skills.</TE>
<TE>   Their combination of power and precision has been a winning one
for Corona del Mar. The brothers also mesh nicely off the court,
getting around in Cameron's 1979 Camaro.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Carsten can't beat Cameron yet, except at Nintendo.</TE>
<TE>   "I work the thumb muscles," Carsten said. "Mine are better."</TE>

<LD>Mike Piazza's left hamstring felt better Wednesday, but the New York
Met catcher probably won't return to the lineup for a couple of days.</LD>
<LD>   Piazza was injured Tuesday night running to first base in
52-degree weather. He spent Wednesday having ice and electric
stimulation treatment on the hamstring.</LD>
<LD>   "It's something you want to be careful with," the nine-time
All-Star said. "The more you treat it and the more the swelling goes
down, the better it feels."</LD>
<TE>   Center fielder Timo Perez, who strained his left hamstring
Tuesday, sat out Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop Rey Ordonez originally was in the lineup but was
scratched because of a strained left rib cage, an injury he told the
team he suffered several days ago.</TE>

<LD>Guard Damon Stoudamire was perfectly willing to talk about basketball
before the Trail Blazers conducted their practice Wednesday afternoon
at Staples Center. But he did not give anything more than one-word
answers when questioned about his upcoming court case.</LD>
<LD>   Police, responding to a burglar alarm on the night of Feb. 23,
found a one-pound bag of marijuana in Stoudamire's Lake Oswego, Ore.,
home.</LD>
<LD>   Stoudamire was not there at the time, but facing the Denver
Nuggets at the Rose Garden. Stoudamire told police the marijuana was
not his and he was not arrested.</LD>
<TE>   The Clackamas County grand jury, however, is scheduled to hear the
case May 2 and will vote on whether to indict Stoudamire on felony
drug charges. He could face up to 10 years in prison and have to pay
a $200,000 fine if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he could face disciplinary action from the NBA,
whether he's convicted or not.</TE>
<TE>   Trail Blazer Coach Maurice Cheeks said basketball has been a
"sanctuary" for Stoudamire since Feb. 23.</TE>
<TE>   "Once he steps onto the floor, he's been able to focus on what
he's trying to do," Cheeks said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Wednesday if he has been able to concentrate on playing
basketball, what with the grand jury investigation only a week away,
Stoudamire said only, "Yep."</TE>
<TE>   He was a bit more expansive during an interview with the Portland
Tribune earlier this week, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it the most emotional thing I have had to deal with?" he said,
repeating a reporter's question. "Yeah. In my life? Yeah. I got into
trouble in high school. I got into trouble in college. But there's a
lot more at stake now in terms of reputation."</TE>
<TE>   Stoudamire scored four points on one-of-eight shooting in 38
minutes Sunday in the Trail Blazers' 95-87 loss to the Lakers in Game
1 of the opening-round playoff series.</TE>
<TE>   Soon enough, the conversation returned to basketball and
Stoudamire seemed more at ease.</TE>
<TE>   When someone wondered what the Trail Blazers can do to slow Kobe
Bryant, who led the Lakers with 34 points in Game 1, he gave a
detailed answer.</TE>
<TE>   "We held him to 10-for-28 shooting, so we did a good job on him
from that standpoint," Stoudamire said, "but he made 11 of 12 free
throws. We can't let him get to the line like that. I think we made
him really comfortable last game. He's going to get his points. We've
got to try to get up on him and try to make him go out of control a
little bit and do different things. We're going to try to change the
flow of his game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Derek Anderson participated in the Trail Blazers' practice
Wednesday, having sat out their workouts Monday and Tuesday because
of flu.</TE>
<TE>   Cheeks said Anderson, who had 22 points in 24 minutes in Game 1,
was "still a little sick" and was concerned that he wouldn't be
effective tonight in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's ready to play," Cheeks said.</TE>

<HD>No Question of Claim to Fame</HD>

<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The newest member of the World Golf Hall of Fame proved he belonged a
long time ago, but there never was the correct category for
86-year-old "Terrible" Tommy Bolt.</LD>
<LD>   The World Golf Foundation's Veterans Committee made the selection,
and when the announcement came Wednesday, Bolt probably celebrated by
throwing a club into a lake.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, Bolt won the 1958 U.S. Open at Southern Hills and 14 other
times on the PGA Tour in a career that began in 1946. He also played
on two Ryder Cup teams and won the Senior PGA Championship in 1969,
but that's not really how he earned his reputation.</LD>
<TE>   It was his temper tantrums. They were legendary, classic and
legion. To top it off, Bolt also had a flair for the dramatic, such
as the time at the 1960 U.S. Open when he happened to hit two balls
into a lake and then threw his driver in there for company.</TE>
<TE>   Bolt, who claims his outbursts and pithy comments were intended
only to provide golf reporters with "good copy," says he actually was
aiming at a carp.</TE>
<TE>   Bolt once told his newspaper friends that his club company in
Maplewood, N.J., had to keep two separate work shifts going to make
enough clubs for Bolt because he destroyed so many.</TE>
<TE>   Bolt says his reputation as a bad boy was because of his face.
Besides, he says, Bobby Jones tossed more clubs than he ever did.</TE>
<TE>   "I only threw four or five clubs in my whole life. You would think
I had thrown them all. Bob Rosburg used to throw it like crazy.
Jackie Burke used to raise hell. He was wild, but nobody would
believe it because he had this little baby face.</TE>
<TE>   "But I had this big jaw, this long chin. Something happened, I did
something about it. I didn't walk off like nothing happened."</TE>
<TE>   One thing certainly did not happen, Bolt says. After one
particularly irritating day, he was supposed to have thrown his
caddie and his bag in a lake.</TE>
<TE>   "No, no, no," Bolt says.</TE>
<TE>   But Tommy Bolt in the Hall of Fame? Yes, yes, yes. It's long
overdue.</TE>
<TE>   Monty Update</TE>
<TE>   News item: Seve Ballesteros defeats Colin Montgomerie in a
match-play event at the Seve Trophy--for the second year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: This is so over the top that it's virtually certain to
chase Monty back into his shell and mess him up so much that it might
even make U.S. fans look good. Ballesteros shot a 78 and Montgomerie
a 73, but because it wasn't stroke play, it didn't matter. What
mattered was that the 45-year-old Spaniard kept winning holes even
though he hit balls so many places, Rand McNally should have been the
tournament sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   On one hole, Seve hit a pull hook off the tee and the ball
traveled only 100 yards into some trees. However, Monty pushed his
drive into the rough and the hole was halved. On another hole,
Ballesteros drove his ball into some twigs and dead leaves and
instead of taking a drop, he whacked the ball just short of the green
and made par.</TE>
<TE>   Said Thomas Bjorn, who played with Darren Clarke: "Every time we
looked up, Monty was in the middle of the fairway, Seve was somewhere
else and then we would see him halving and winning all these holes.
It must be horrifying to play against."</TE>
<TE>   By the way, Monty is No. 31 in the Official World Ranking.
Ballesteros is No. 1,240.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   It was an official announcement that was never made, but Tiger
Woods has "officially" switched exclusively to the Nike forged
Titanium driver. He started using a prototype of the driver with the
275 cubic centimeter head at Pebble Beach but didn't sign off on the
club until after the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Nike Golf chief Bob Wood said it's good to have the top player in
the world hitting your company's driver.</TE>
<TE>   Says Wood: "It's incredible the direct impact he has on the
attention the product gets."</TE>
<TE>   Shoe News</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam has a deal with Callaway Golf to play its clubs,
wear a logo on her headgear and shirt and a clothing deal with Cutter
and Buck.</TE>
<TE>   "But her feet are free," Wood said.</TE>
<TE>   Remember the red slip-ons that Sorenstam wore when she won at
Mission Hills? She didn't get paid for it because she doesn't have an
endorsement deal for shoes. But at the Masters, Sorenstam spent a lot
of time with Nike Golf representatives, including Wood. But Wood said
there's no deal in the works, yet.</TE>
<TE>   "She wears the shoes because she likes us," he said. "I think she
has got her eye on what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Good Move</TE>
<TE>   It isn't often that the USGA gets a pat on the back, but for the
second year in a row, it deserves one for the way it handled Nancy
Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   You might remember when the USGA didn't give Lopez a special
exemption into the U.S. Open and was widely roasted for being cold
and heartless. Now that Lopez is on her farewell tour, the warm and
fuzzy USGA gave a special exemption to the 45-year-old, four-time
Open runner-up and Hall of Fame member.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Women's Open is July 4-7 at Prairie Dunes in Hutchinson,
Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez was named Wednesday as the winner of the PGA of America's
First Lady of Golf Award. It's given to a woman who has made
significant contributions to the promotion of golf.</TE>
<TE>   Sad Move</TE>
<TE>   Last day for the 50-year-old Desert Inn Golf Club is June 29.
Developer Steve Wynn is going to put a new resort on the site,
including a Tom Fazio course that should open in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Tip Your Wait Staff</TE>
<TE>   What we know about Hugh Baiocchi: South African, 55, seven-time
winner on European PGA Tour, $4-million winner on Senior PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   What we didn't know about Baiocchi: He's funny.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps he was being unintentionally funny in a recent
question-and-answer session, but whatever his motivation, he came up
with some lines worthy of a standup act.</TE>
<TE>   For instance:</TE>
<TE>   Q: If you could have a job outside of golf for a day, what would
it be?</TE>
<TE>   Baiocchi: "President Bush, so I could order people around."</TE>
<TE>   Q: If you weren't a golfer, what sport could you see yourself
playing?</TE>
<TE>   Baiocchi: "A world-class tennis player because they don't have to
haul golf clubs around and they only have to carry a couple of
rackets around and wear white shorts."</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did you have a favorite subject in school?</TE>
<TE>   Baiocchi: "Probably Latin ... I couldn't understand it and no one
else seemed to either."</TE>
<TE>   That's a Wrap</TE>
<TE>   Jill McGill has declined Playboy's offer to pose for the magazine.
McGill finished second in Playboy.com poll of LPGA players that
Internet readers would most like to see.</TE>
<TE>   However, she has not kept her public relations acumen under wraps.
McGill has had plenty of TV exposure lately, appearing on "Best Damn
Sports Show Period" and "Unscripted."</TE>
<TE>   They Shoot, They Score</TE>
<TE>   It's still early, but if it holds up, Sorenstam's 69.00 scoring
average would be the lowest in LPGA history. She set the Vare Trophy
record last year with a scoring average of 69.42. This season, Grace
Park is second with 70.30, which would have won the Vare Trophy 44 of
the 49 times it has been awarded.</TE>

<LD>Oscar De La Hoya has retired.</LD>
<LD>   The news was stunning, shocking. Nobody saw it coming.</LD>
<LD>   Not even De La Hoya.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday, nearly a week after radio station KSPN (1110) reported
that De La Hoya was retiring at 29, the former Olympic gold medalist
and current World Boxing Council super-welterweight champion sat in
his office in a Los Angeles skyscraper, looking content about his
physical condition, excited about his upcoming bout against Fernando
Vargas and determined to fulfill his long-term goals in boxing.</TE>
<TE>   Retirement? He laughed at the idea.</TE>
<TE>   But he admitted he wasn't laughing several weeks ago when an
injury to his left hand forced a postponement of the fight.
Originally scheduled for May 4 at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Events
Center, it has been moved to Sept. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Working with sparring partner Julio Garcia at his Big Bear
training headquarters, De La Hoya landed a left hook on the top of
Garcia's head.</TE>
<TE>   And shuddered at the result.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I had broken my hand," De La Hoya said. "My left hook
had caught him solid and it felt like my hand had shattered. I had
felt pain before in that hand, but not that bad."</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya had injured the hand last November, requiring surgery
to repair torn cartilage and shave a bone spur.</TE>
<TE>   Although he admits he didn't work hard enough rehabilitating after
surgery, De La Hoya figured the problems with his left hand, his
primary weapon throughout his career, were behind him.</TE>
<TE>   The flare-up left him emotionally devastated.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking my career was over," he said. "My world was
crushed. Things had been going so perfect. I wondered, 'What am I
going to do next?' I was very confused.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have the itch to fight. I want to fight. I have to fight.
Despite all I have accomplished, I feel the defining moments of my
career are still ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I still haven't fought the fights that are going to make
my legend."</TE>
<TE>   At first, De La Hoya thought about ignoring the pain and going
ahead with the Vargas fight as scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   But when he found that merely touching the heavy bag--never mind
punching it--caused him pain, he knew it wouldn't be logical to
proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't even shadow box," he said. "I could have said that I
was going ahead with the fight, but I was not going to go into the
ring with one hand. That would have given Vargas too much of an
advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, De La Hoya has begun a vigorous rehabilitation program
under Dr. Tony Daly, who says the key to the fighter's return is to
strengthen his left hand so that it can withstand the future pounding
required.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a common injury in boxing," Daly said, "not one you would
call career ending."</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya reiterated Wednesday that, beyond Vargas, he wants to
fight Felix Trinidad and Shane Mosley, both of whom have beaten him.</TE>
<TE>   He would like to fight Trinidad in early spring of next year,
followed by Mosley, assuming De La Hoya continues to win.</TE>
<TE>   And then, said De La Hoya, he anticipates follow-up fights with
each man.</TE>
<TE>   Retirement? Don't make him laugh.</TE>

<TE>   Promoter Bob Arum began negotiations for a Floyd Mayweather
Jr.-Jose Luis Castillo rematch at Staples Center on August 10.</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather won a unanimous decision over Castillo last Saturday at

title.</TE>
<TE>   It appears difficult bargaining will be required to make Arum's
proposal a reality.</TE>

<LD>Rick Odekirk, 44, and his brother Jeff, 37, were avid USC fans
growing up in Glendale. Both attended USC, and Rick was a pitcher on
the baseball team.</LD>
<LD>   With Jeff getting married this weekend, Rick wanted to do
something special instead of holding a traditional bachelor party. So
he rented the Coliseum field for $1,300, decorated the USC locker
room and arranged for Charles White, Jeff's favorite Trojan, and
former Dodger Bill Russell, Jeff's favorite baseball player, to show
up for a gathering last Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Craig Fertig and a few other former Trojans were also there.
"Unbelievable" is how Jeff described the surprise affair.</LD>

<TE>   Familiar story: Mark Kreidler of the Sacramento Bee, commenting on
the Utah Jazz, which was routed by the Kings during the regular
season but has evened their playoff series at 1-1: "Sacramento has so
much in its lineup, so much along its bench, that it's always
shocking to see the Kings picked apart by the sheer force of
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's what this series is about so far, about [John]
Stockton and [Karl] Malone commanding the stage at all the precisely
important moments."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The weatherman: After a recent unseasonably warm spell in New
York, Met catcher Mike Piazza pondered the possibility that it was
caused by changes in the earth's atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not buying the whole global-warming theory," he told the
Newark Star-Ledger. "Back in the Industrial Revolution, there were no
limits on pollution and no catalytic converters and things like that.
Probably the level of pollution was higher back in the 1900s."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you say, Mike.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stylish recruiting: Indianapolis Colt owner Jim Irsay is asking
his neighbors for permission to use his 10-seat, twin-engine
helicopter to and from his home in Carmel, Ind., to entertain--and
impress--free agents. Neighbors have complained about the noise from
the helicopter, and Carmel officials last year notified Irsay he
would need a zoning approval. The board put off a decision until next
month.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Playmaker: Shaun Powell of Newsday, commenting on the skill of
New Jersey Net playmaker Jason Kidd: "Kidd is probably one of only
seven or eight players who's truly worth paying the going rate for
tickets, regular season or playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1976, Chicago Cub center fielder Rick
Monday snatched an American flag away from two protesters who were
trying to set it on fire in left field at Dodger Stadium.</TE>

<TE>   Trivia answer: Magic Johnson, .911 in 1988-89. The NBA record is

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: From Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"The good news for Raider fans is that the team drafted well this
year, made intelligent picks, by the book, didn't take wild fliers,
didn't throw down the rent money on hard eight.</TE>
<TE>   "So where was Al?</TE>
<TE>   "Just kidding. As always, the Raiders' war room was a phone booth,
with Al Davis inside making all the calls, and his coaching staff and
advisors hanging around outside, lagging coins at cracks in the
sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Davis still calls the shots."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Beyond the Glory"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Fox Sports Net, Sunday, 8 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant is featured on this week's edition of "Beyond the
Glory," and although it's an informative and well-produced show, it
may not go far enough to fully explain Bryant, who remains somewhat
of an enigma.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Bryant, others interviewed include Jerry West, Phil
Jackson, Eddie Jones, Derek Fisher, Kurt Rambis, Bryant's high school
coach and a couple of high school teammates. Maybe more noteworthy is
who is not interviewed--Bryant's parents, his wife and Shaquille
O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   One thing the show focuses on is Bryant's adjustment to life in
the NBA as a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   "What do I want to go into a bar for? I don't drink," he says.
"I'm underage anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Another topic is Bryant's feud with O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "We're both killers," Bryant says. "We like to go for your throat.
It was just a matter of us finding out how we can do that and do it
together. Then we figured it out. It was fun getting there."</TE>

<HD>Daal Pitches In Another Win</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He beats Pirates, 5-1, for second victory
replacing Brown but appears headed to bullpen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Dodger ace Kevin Brown is tentatively scheduled to come off the
disabled list Tuesday, which means Omar Daal, who in the words of his
manager was "brilliant" in Wednesday night's 5-1 victory over the
Pittsburgh Pirates, will go back to the bullpen.</LD>
<LD>   Daal, 30, is a luxury the Dodgers can afford, a $5-million
insurance policy in case one of their starting pitchers gets hurt,
but Daal's predicament could put a crimp in his career, possibly
costing him millions.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran left-hander, who gave up one run and five hits in six
innings of a victory before 14,057 at PNC Park that assured the
Dodgers of their fifth series win in seven series this season, will
be a free agent next winter, and there isn't a bustling market for
long relievers.</LD>
<TE>   "I have to do the best for the team, but on the other side, they
have to know they're not doing right by me," said Daal, who is 2-0
with an 0.73 earned-run average in two starts in place of Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "They're taking money out of my pocket. It's tough. It's not fair.
Everyone knows I can start. I respect all the starters here, but they
have to know I need my chance, either here or wherever."</TE>
<TE>   Wherever looked mighty appealing to Daal a month ago, when he
demanded a trade after being told he would open the season in the
bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   But with starters Brown and Andy Ashby coming off elbow surgery
and left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii struggling with his control at the
time, General Manager Dan Evans made it clear to Daal he wasn't going
anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Daal (3-0) gave up two runs in four relief appearances, and his
success as a starter enables the Dodgers to be very cautious with
Brown's rehabilitation from an inflamed elbow.</TE>
<TE>   "Kevin Brown's health will dictate when he comes back, and I'll
leave it at that," Manager Jim Tracy said. "We have a very special
commodity in Omar Daal, and we know that. What a brilliant move it
was holding onto this man. Whether he's in the bullpen or rotation,
you know what you're going to get."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night, Daal gave the Dodgers a near carbon copy of his
61/3-inning effort against San Diego last Thursday, when he gave up
two unearned runs and three hits and struck out eight in a 5-2 win.
He changed speeds against the Pirates, mixed his pitches well and had
excellent control, striking out six and walking one.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is he's a starter, and he knows it," left fielder
Brian Jordan said. "It's an unfortunate situation for him being in
the bullpen, but I appreciate the way he's handled himself. He could
have been a bad apple, but when he was asked to do a job, he's done
it."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who have won seven of their last nine and are 5-0
against left-handed starters this season, staked Daal to a 2-0 lead
on Marquis Grissom's first-inning homer and Eric Karros'
second-inning RBI double.</TE>
<TE>   Doubles by Brian Giles and Craig Wilson pulled the Pirates to
within 2-1 in the fourth, and Daal pitched out of a jam in the fifth,
striking out pitcher Dave Williams and retiring Adrian Brown on a
slow roller to short after Jack Wilson's one-out triple.</TE>
<TE>   Karros' double sparked a three-run rally in the seventh, which
included RBI singles by Mark Grudzielanek and pinch-hitter Hiram
Bocachica, and Grissom's sacrifice fly, and gave the Dodgers a 5-1
lead. Karros, a career .259 hitter in April, is batting .319 in the
first month of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Pirates loaded the bases with two out in the eighth when Jesse
Orosco gave up a single to Giles and walked Craig Wilson and Jason
Kendall. But Tracy summoned right-hander Giovanni Carrara, who blew a
94-mph fastball by pinch-hitter Rob Mackowiak for strike three to end
the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Omar gave us six great innings, and the bullpen did a very good
job," Tracy said. "I'm not saying this egotistically, but with the
pitching staff we have, five runs is a lot for the Dodgers."</TE>
<TE>   Daal is an important part of that staff, whether he's in the
rotation or bullpen, but he prefers to be a starter.</TE>
<TE>   "At least I've shown them what I can do," Daal said. "I've proved
it to everybody and myself, and now it's out of my hands. It's
frustrating when you know you can be there every five days, but they
already have their five starters, and I can't do anything about it."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Eager Quantrill Rebounds From Slow Start</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Dodger reliever Paul Quantrill won't be coming out with a Keyshawn
Johnson-like autobiography any time soon, but he can relate to the
title of the Tampa Bay Buccaneer receiver's book.</LD>
<LD>   "I want the ball, I want it a lot, I want it when it counts,"
Quantrill said. "But our entire bullpen has the same attitude.
Giovanni [Carrara] and I are interchangeable, and Jesse [Orosco] can
pitch the eighth inning too."</LD>
<LD>   The three setup men and closer Eric Gagne have given the Dodgers a
formidable late-inning presence, compiling a 2.11 earned-run average
in 422/3 innings, 34 strikeouts and nine walks after two more
scoreless innings in Wednesday night's 5-1 victory over the Pirates.</LD>
<TE>   Quantrill is glad to be a contributing member of the group after a
rocky start. The right-hander gave up seven earned runs in 62/3
innings during his first six appearances, leaving him with an 0-2
record and an unsightly 9.45 ERA on April 13.</TE>
<TE>   But the sinkerball specialist rebounded, giving up no runs and
three hits in 42/3 innings during his next six games, including a
scoreless eighth in Tuesday night's 9-6 victory over Pittsburgh and a
scoreless seventh Wednesday, to lower his ERA to 5.56.</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill thrives on work--he led the American League with 80
appearances for Toronto last season while going 11-2 with a 3.04
ERA--and it took him a few weeks to gain command of his sinker and
slider. Quantrill struck out Adrian Brown looking at a nice slider
that broke about two feet Tuesday night, and he struck out two more
Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not right where I want to be, but I'm getting there,"
Quantrill said. "I feel like I have my legs underneath me to the
point where I feel I can get outs and compete. I'm 100% physically,
but a lot of it has to do with rhythm and feeling comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As if Gagne's start--eight saves in his first eight opportunities
and an ERA of 0.00 in 11 appearances--wasn't impressive enough, the
right-hander also has not allowed a batter to reach base in his last
five appearances, retiring 18 in a row after saving Tuesday night's
win.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very poised guy," Manager Jim Tracy said. "Very little
fazes him. He's not afraid of anyone, as evidenced by the way he
pitches--he's coming to get you. He has the character and makeup to
fit that role."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne, a converted starter, has been able to build confidence in
his new role with a minimal amount of pressure--he had three-run
leads to protect in six of his first eight saves.</TE>
<TE>   "But close games don't seem to bother him either," Tracy said. "He
gives me the impression that he doesn't know what the score is.</TE>
<TE>   "His attitude is it's the ninth inning, I'm going to get three
hitters out. That's what I see."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In only 37 at-bats this season, reserve outfielder Marquis Grissom
has 10 runs batted in, ranking him second with Brian Jordan and Eric
Karros behind team RBI leader Shawn Green (13). Grissom homered in
the first inning and had a sacrifice fly in the seventh Wednesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "You see the discipline at the plate we saw last May," Tracy said.
"When he makes the pitcher come to the plate, he's a good offensive
player. When he chases pitches and expands the strike zone, he gets
in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, 35, hit .343 in May but .190 the rest of the season,
finishing with a .221 average, 16 walks and 107 strikeouts. He went
back to his farm in Georgia last winter--"I didn't even think about
baseball," he said--made some adjustments in his batting stance this
spring and is hitting .324.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I'm more selective at the plate," Grissom said. "I played
well in the first half last year, but in the second half, the mental
part of my game was gone.... But I'm looking for big things from
myself this year, because everyone thinks I'm done."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Park Staggers Out of Gate</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Confusion is created by late betting through
wagering hub in Maine and a blank tote board for first two races.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opening day at Hollywood Park quickly turned into widespread
confusion and scattered anger Wednesday when a number of fans
suspected that tens of thousands of dollars had been bet on the
first-race winner after the horses had left the gate.</LD>
<LD>   When eight maiden fillies broke for the 41/2-furlong race, Global
Finance's odds showed at 9-2. But by the time the field crossed the
finish line--and before the "official" sign went up--her odds had
plummeted to 2-5. Fans were aghast that Global Finance's win payoff
was only $2.80 instead of about $11, which would have been the return
at 9-2 odds.</LD>
<LD>   Adding to the confusion was the fact that the Hollywood Park tote
board was blank for the first two races. The odds appeared on the
large infield TV screen to the right of the tote board.</LD>
<TE>   Hostility, the 6-5 favorite on the screen when the race began,
finished second, 31/2 lengths behind Global Finance, at final odds of
9-2.</TE>
<TE>   Track officials explained that a large amount of win bets had been
placed on Global Finance just before the start of the race through a
wagering hub in Lewiston, Maine. The bets totaled $118,000--23 bets
at $5,000 and one at $3,000. Before those bets, only $11,461 was in
the win pool on Global Finance.</TE>
<TE>   The last-second bets on Global Finance at Lewiston resulted in a
profit of $47,200.</TE>
<TE>   Bettors placing large bets at post time have been a source of
concern for tracks since the expansion of off-track betting in recent
years. One bettor in particular in North Dakota has been known to
place thousands of dollars in bets just before horses leave the gate.
Authorities there have investigated his activities and found nothing
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the surge in off-track betting, it is not unusual for
tote-board odds to change after a race has begun. What made
Wednesday's incident so glaring was the transfer of favoritism from
one horse to a filly that was 6-1--the fourth betting choice--on the
morning line. Global Finance had run only once before, finishing
seventh in a 10-horse field in a two-furlong race at Santa Anita on
March 27. She went off at 9-2 odds that day.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Park runs an explanation of late odds changes in its
daily program.</TE>
<TE>   "Odds displayed on the tote board are not final when the horses
break from the gate," the notice says. "Money from out-of-state is
updated in approximately 60-second intervals. With the start of the
race, betting instantly shuts down. Final odds appear on the tote
board when the final out-of-state information is received."</TE>
<TE>   In another era, bookmakers referred to bets made after the start
of a race as "past-posting." One of the plot turns in the movie "The
Sting" revolved around bets in a bookie joint after the races were
over. Largely missing from tracks now are "bell-ringers"--wily
bettors who would position themselves at mutuel windows, money in
hand, ready to make split-second bets on horses that broke sharply.</TE>
<TE>   Their partners in the scheme would focus on the field with
binoculars, then quickly deliver hand signals as the gates opened. At
one time, the New York tracks sought to thwart bell-ringers by
cutting off all bets after the fourth-to-last horse in the field had
been loaded into the gate.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's crowd of 7,851--admission was free--appeared to have
recovered from the first-race tremors by the time trainer Tim
Pinfield saddled favored Line Rider to a half-length victory in the
$77,925 Harry Henson Stakes. A race later, Ladies Din, a 7-year-old
gelding that had run only twice since 2000, took a small step in the
direction of the $2-million earnings plateau with a two-length
victory in a $62,000 allowance.</TE>
<TE>   Line Rider is one of the last horses Pinfield will start before he
leaves to take a training post in Singapore on June 1. The
English-born conditioner has been in California for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have been really going good here for the last 18 months,"
Pinfield said. "But the opportunity in Singapore is so huge that I
just couldn't pass it up."</TE>
<TE>   Line Rider, sold as a yearling for $650,000 at a Keeneland
auction, began his career in Europe, winning only one of eight starts
and four times being beaten by Johannesburg, last year's Breeders'
Cup Juvenile winner and one of the favorites for this year's Kentucky
Derby. Wednesday's victory, in 563/5 seconds for 51/2 furlongs over
Hollywood's turf course, was his first victory in three starts for
Pinfield. Mike Smith, who hadn't been aboard Line Rider before, rode
the winner, who paid $8.</TE>
<TE>   "You hate to say goodbye to horses like these," the 35-year-old
Pinfield said. "I've got about 30 horses here. I'm taking a few with
me, some will be sold, and the rest will be dispersed among several
trainers."</TE>
<TE>   Line Rider, fifth at the top of the stretch, overtook Ecstatic in
the final strides. Mighty David caught Ecstatic at the wire to
dead-heat for second place.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Mike before the race to take his time, because there
appeared to be plenty of pace to run at," Pinfield said. "Just let
the others cut their own throats."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Stevens, who had ridden Line Rider to a second-place finish
at Santa Anita on April 11, was astride Red Briar, the second betting
choice who finished fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary told me this colt would really improve off his last race,"
Smith said. "This horse might even go on. We might get a mile with
him."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Valenzuela rode Ladies Din to his 11th victory in 34 starts.
It was the first time trainer Julio Canani's veteran had won since
the Eddie Read Handicap at Del Mar in July 2000. Ladies Din hadn't
won in six grass starts at Hollywood, although one first-place finish
had been negated by a stewards' disqualification. Giving Canani his
second victory on the card, he completed the mile in 1:333/4, earned
$37,200 and boosted his total to $1.7 million.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With four months of the year almost complete, trainer Pete Eurton,
according to statistics in Thursday's Daily Racing Form, has three
victories in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   He could double his output in the final three races on today's
card at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Eurton has the morning-line favorites in the day's concluding pick
three--5-2 choice Dinnerathepalms in the sixth, Elaine's Angel at 2-1
in the seventh and 5-2 choice Golden Hours in the eighth.</LD>
<TE>   A gelded son of Tsunami Slew, Dinnerathepalms returns to a claimer
after three consecutive defeats in low-level allowance races. The
last time he ran for a tag, the 5-year-old won by two lengths under
Alex Solis, who has the mount again today in the $32,000 claimer at
11/16 miles on the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine's Angel, a 4-year-old T.U. Slew filly, will break from the
inside in a field of five in the seventh, an optional claimer at
11/16 miles. The beaten favorite in her last, she again will be
handled by Solis and tries for her first win in her fourth start at
Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   In the finale, Golden Hours has little to defeat in the 11/16-mile
race for $32,000 maidens. The Candi's Gold gelding lost a
heartbreaker in his most recent race, missing by a nose to California
Goal on March 29 at Santa Anita. Like the other two Eurton runners,
Golden Hours will be ridden by Solis, Santa Anita's leading rider.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Sweetest Thing, Lapuma and Tweedside head the
field in the $100,000 Bewitch at 11/2 miles on the turf today at
Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Mark Frostad. The trainer won with seven of his first
17 starters at Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Harry Nelson. The trainer has begun 2002 with two
winners from 41 starters.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Emerald Monique, Maura's
Diamond and Alessandria in the fifth, Dinnerathepalms and Hero's
Welcome in the sixth, Revillew Slew and Elaine's Angel in the seventh
and Golden Hours and Mr. Chris Gibbs in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/2. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $10/$10. Total money bet: $16.</TE>

<KH>KING REPORT</KH>
<HD>Injured Deadmarsh May Sit; Ronning Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings will be short-handed tonight when they try to keep from
being eliminated by the Colorado Avalanche in Game 5 of their series.</LD>
<LD>   Cliff Ronning, who missed Tuesday's game, is out with what Coach
Andy Murray said were "concussion-like symptoms." The Kings may also
be without right wing Adam Deadmarsh, who crashed into the boards at
the start of the third period Tuesday. Deadmarsh underwent an MRI
Wednesday, which showed no damage, but he does have a strained neck.</LD>
<LD>   "We're trying to get him loosened up," Murray said. "There is no
structural damage, it's a strain. I think if there is any way for
Adam to play, he'll be in there."</LD>
<TE>   If Deadmarsh cannot play, Murray will fill out his top line with
either Steve Heinze, Mikko Eloranta or Craig Johnson. All three
skated with Jason Allison and Ziggy Palffy in the third period
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing you saw are all three options," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Ronning has not felt well since the first game of the series, when
Rob Blake leveled him. He was ready to play Tuesday, but Murray sent
him to be tested.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he felt lethargic and not real sharp," Murray said. "We
have had enough players that have had concussions to know how they're
feeling."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Heinze came close to ending his 27 game goal-less streak when he
nearly tied the score with eight seconds left Tuesday. He picked up a
loose puck at the side of the net and, with Avalanche goalie Patrick
Roy out of position, flipped a shot that hit the outside of the post.</TE>
<TE>   "I just would have loved to see him get some reward," Murray said.
"I thought he worked and competed, for whatever reason, somebody has
decided he shouldn't score until [tonight]."</TE>
<TE>   Heinze hasn't scored a goal since Jan. 15 against Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Beating Roy was on the Kings' mind after the veteran goalie picked
up his 20th career playoff shutout in Tuesday's 1-0 Avalanche
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything Patrick sees, he's going to stop," defenseman Mathieu
Schneider said. "We have to get some tips and deflections and
rebounds. They are going to be ugly goals. We scored a few pretty
ones this series, we've been fortunate. This time of year, the way we
have to play, they are going to be ugly."</TE>
<TE>   Said Eric Belanger: "We have to keep shooting. There's no secret
there. If we can get a couple behind Patrick we are going to be able
to get at him."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, though, won't be looking to play a more wide-open style
that produced 15 goals in the first two games of the series.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think either team wants to play like that, it's too
risky," Murray said. "You go in with the mind-set that you're going
to get five goals on Patrick Roy, you're going to have to give
something up to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Neatly printed on the board in the King dressing room were the
words "Win Thursday and we will be playing Game 7 Monday."</TE>
<TE>   Murray used much of the same motivation last season, when the
Kings went to Denver trailing the Avalanche, 3-1, in a second-round
series. The Kings won the next two games, then lost Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   "We're facing the same situation," Mattias Norstrom said. "It's
the same attitude. It's a big task to beat the Avalanche, but every
singe guy in this room is confident we can do that."</TE>
<TE>   As is their coach.</TE>
<TE>   "We're down 3-1 and we could be waiting for the next team [in the
second round] right now," Murray said. "It's hard to believe, but
that's the way we feel. Obviously, Colorado has every right to say
the same thing. This could be over and it wouldn't be necessary for
them to play Game 5. That's how even the games have been."</TE>

<HD>Once Again, Kings on Thin Ice</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Trailing Avalanche, 3-1, in best-of-seven series,
L.A. faces long odds, but that's nothing new.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The end is near.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings are finished.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last year and a half, the Kings have heard those words
more times than they'd care to count.</LD>
<TE>   Each time, their response has been, in effect, "Says who?"</TE>
<TE>   Last season, struggling to stay above .500 before making two key
late-season trades, they vaulted into the playoffs on the strength of
a 13-2-5-2 finish.</TE>
<TE>   Once there, they defied long odds by rallying from a 2-0 deficit
to eliminate the Detroit Red Wings in a stunning first-round upset.
In the second round, they climbed out of a 3-1 hole against the
Colorado Avalanche, nearly derailing the Avalanche's Stanley Cup
championship run before losing in Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   This season, all but left for dead and publicly ridiculed by their
coach after a 5-11-1-2 start left them near the bottom of the Western
Conference, they pieced together the NHL's best record over the last
four months of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Again losing the first two games of their first-round playoff
series, this time against the Avalanche, they responded with a 3-1
victory in Game 3 on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But after being shut out Tuesday night in Game 4 by Colorado
goaltender Patrick Roy, 1-0, they find themselves in a familiar
position as they prepare for Game 5 tonight in the Pepsi Center.</TE>
<TE>   On the brink of elimination.</TE>
<TE>   Only 16 of the 186 teams that have lost three of the first four
games of a best-of-seven NHL playoff series, or 8.6%, have rallied to
win the series, though the odds have improved over the last 15 years,
with 14 of 102 going on to win. One was the Kings, who in Wayne
Gretzky's first season with the club eliminated his former team, the
Edmonton Oilers, after trailing, 3-1, in a first-round series in
1989.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, though, played Game 5 that year at the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   This team, a terror on the road for months, is 0-7-1 away from
Staples Center since March 18, when it defeated the San Jose Sharks,
3-2, at San Jose, and will play tonight without one of its top six
forwards, possibly two.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Ronning, suffering from a possible concussion, did not make
the trip after sitting out Tuesday night's game, and Adam Deadmarsh
is questionable after suffering a strained neck Tuesday night while
diving into the end boards trying to make a third-period hit on
Avalanche defenseman Adam Foote.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche, meanwhile, has won six of seven series after
building a 3-1 lead, losing only to the Oilers in 1998. Coach Bob
Hartley's team has won its last three games against the Kings in the
Pepsi Center and four of five.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Kings are hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   "We have played our best hockey when we are against the wall,"
defenseman Mathieu Schneider said Wednesday in El Segundo before the
Kings departed for Colorado. "I don't think this is going to be an
exception.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to go out and put our best game on the ice. I don't
think there is any doubt in anyone's mind that we're capable of
beating this team."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings won Game 5 last year at Denver, 1-0, behind goaltender
Felix Potvin. Also, before their late-season slide, they had earned
points in 22 of 26 road games from mid-November through their victory
last month at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I look at it is, we turned our season around in December
by going on the road and winning," Coach Andy Murray said. "My
positive outlook on things is, we're going to turn this playoff
series around by going into Denver and winning on the road. I think
there's a comparison and that's what I like to draw on.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much easier to draw on the scenarios you like to paint than
the ones that could be painted for you. I have to look at it that
way. It's my job."</TE>
<TE>   But winning in the Pepsi Center against the defending champions
won't be easy, especially if two key players are out of the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "They have great fans and great chemistry in their building,"
Schneider said. "We have to overcome that. At times, it can be like
we're playing six guys on the ice. But we should have won at least
one of the last two in there....</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter where we're playing right now. They probably
feel an advantage going home. But there has to be something in the
back of their minds remembering last season, when we went in there
and beat them. I think they know we could have won any of these
games. It has to be in their heads right now."</TE>
<TE>   If not, it's in the Kings'.</TE>
<TE>   But will that be enough?</TE>

Long Road Back
The Kings battled back from a 3-1 series deficit to eventual Stanley
Cup champion Colorado in the Western Conference semifinals last year
only to lose Game 7 on the road, 5-1. The Kings were successful in
recovering from a 3-1 series deficit once, in the 1989 divisional
semifinals against Edmonton. Calgary swept the Kings in the
divisional finals. The Edmonton series:
Game 1 Edmonton 4, at Kings 3
Game 2 at Kings 5, Edmonton 2
Game 3 at Edmonton 4, Kings 0
Game 4 at Edmonton 4, Kings 3
Game 5 at Kings 4, Edmonton 2
Game 6 Kings 4, at Edmonton 1
Game 7 at Kings 6, Edmonton 3</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS PORTLAND vs. LAKERS: SERIES REPORT/LAKER NOTES</KH>
<HD>Heisley: West 'Seriously Considering'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Memphis Grizzly owner Michael Heisley and Jerry West spoke Wednesday
morning for three hours about the possibility of West assuming
command of basketball operations for that franchise, sources with
knowledge of the negotiations said.</LD>
<LD>   While insisting he has no deal with West, Heisley told Memphis
reporters, "Are we aggressively trying to pursue an arrangement with
Jerry? I would say we've been fairly aggressive."</LD>
<LD>   Heisley spoke in response to a report that West had agreed to a
multiyear arrangement with the Grizzlies.</LD>
<TE>   "The speculation scares me because I'm not sure how Jerry will
look at it," Heisley said. "We do not have an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry is seriously considering the situation and when he's ready
to make his announcement, he will make his announcement. I'm not the
person that's making that decision."</TE>
<TE>   West has been affiliated with the Lakers for more than four
decades as a player, coach, executive and consultant, in recent years
forming strong bonds with Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, both
acquired in the same summer nearly six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Asked his reaction were West to leave the organization, Bryant
paused and said, "It means I'll be going to Memphis."</TE>
<TE>   He smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "No, just playing," he said. "Whatever makes him happy. It [would
be] a new era. Mitch [Kupchak, the general manager] has done an
excellent job. Jerry has trained him well."</TE>
<TE>   During some of the most trying times of his career, Bryant has
been able to call West, or knock on the door of West's Bel-Air home,
seeking advice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been that way since I was 17, when I first came out to
L.A.," Bryant said. "I'm sure that's not going to change."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has been a lighter personality in the last week, perhaps
because he has left behind the drudgery of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   When Coach Phil Jackson was asked if O'Neal was happier because
his toe felt better or because the playoffs simply brought a better
mood for all, he ignored the question, made up his own question and,
grinning, answered it this way:</TE>
<TE>   "I think all players enjoy the playoffs. There's some weight in it
because we have to come in and do 30 minutes of press every time, and
you guys make us sit through the whole time period. During the
regular season it's only five minutes or something, and then you
excuse us. And we have to let you in for 30 minutes of practice. So,
we spend so much time--probably more time than you guys spend with
your families, you spend with us--during the course of the playoffs.
A person can't even have a pimple without it being exposed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers lost a tiebreaker with the San Antonio Spurs and will
choose 27th in the first round of the NBA draft, the league announced
Wednesday. The Spurs, who will pick 26th, and the Lakers finished the
regular season with records of 58-24.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Strive to Keep Edge</HD>
<DH>NBA playoffs: There has been ample time to see what can
befall other Western Conference favorites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These are grand days in El Segundo, where the Lakers are hale and
(they believe) prepared and (they're sure) holding the last two NBA
championship trophies, not to mention a 1-0 lead over the Portland
Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   They spent the last three days dallying in questions of sweeps and
three-peats and small lineups versus large, about how they feel and
how the Trail Blazers must feel, and what all of this has to do with,
oh, Kobe Bryant's new haircut and sparkling purple earring.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal is no longer running as though he has a sheet of
aluminum foil wrapped around his foot, and Bryant mused that if Jerry
West were going to Memphis then so would he, and everyone laughed
with him, and no one was the least suspicious that this crossed his
mind at all.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, one loss, particularly at home, and the whole thing
burns down.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers play the Trail Blazers tonight at Staples Center in
Game 2, a juncture apparently more dangerous than previously
believed. Game 2s already have meant disaster in top-seeded
Sacramento and second-seeded San Antonio, where underdogs Utah and
Seattle were winners and now will play host to consecutive games at
their places.</TE>
<TE>   "The onus is still on protecting our home floor," Laker forward
Rick Fox said. "Nothing is entitled to us right now. Well, the only
thing entitled is the two trophies up in Dr. Buss' office right now.
They can't take those back."</TE>
<TE>   As for the top-seeded teams losing, Fox said, "If there's not
enough fair warning, there is now."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. doesn't really do angst, primarily because it mixes so poorly
with a suntan. So there is a calm that follows the Lakers, from the
people who cling to the parking lot gate in El Segundo to those who
slouch in the courtside seats, some of the most expensive rental
folding chairs in the world. Angst in the first round or two is so
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have identical cool. Shaq wears goofy hats that balance
atop his head like a child on a beach ball. Bryant wears sunglasses
that don't keep the sun out. After shaving himself clean a month ago,
all of Fox's head and facial hair is coming in at the same rate, for
a look that whispers, "Chia Pet."</TE>
<TE>   This is how they stand, 14 victories from their third consecutive
title, from what has become the standard requirement for passable.
They've played once in seven days, the eight-point victory in Game 1,
and then rested-studied-practiced-analyzed for three days.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson would like to get O'Neal the basketball
earlier in the offense and closer to the basket than in Game 1, among
other things. Trail Blazer Coach Maurice Cheeks would like to
pressure the Lakers harder on defense and go to the rim more
aggressively than in Game 1, among other things.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson expects Bonzi Wells and Scottie Pippen to play better than
in Game 1. Cheeks expects, well, the same thing, probably.</TE>
<TE>   All of which could happen, and the Lakers could still win. Or, the
whole thing could burn down.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just going to go out there and play," Bryant said. "We're
the champions. We're the kings of the hill."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, and Bryant in particular, appear to pull great
strength from that. The trickle-down confidence from O'Neal and
Bryant runs to Fox and Derek Fisher and Robert Horry and the others.</TE>
<TE>   In a championship era of "Two ... and counting," a fledgling
dynasty, they really are counting, it would seem. They live off the
day and feed the season, at least at this time of year, when counting
backward from 15 seems a lot less daunting than starting at 82.</TE>
<TE>   "These games are so important," Fisher said. "It's almost like
each game is just one game, it really isn't part of a series. It's
one game, then wait three or four days and play another one."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, however, O'Neal's arthritic toe is more manageable.
He ran in parts of Wednesday's practice and by the end had a shirt
full of sweat. Horry's abdominal injury appears to be less of a
hindrance. The down time is so long, Bryant is trying to add a
three-point shot to his game, and now occasionally wins the
post-practice shooting contests.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaquille needs as much rest as possible," Jackson said. "It's
good for us. It's good for Robert Horry. It's good for what we're
trying to do as a basketball club. We have some players who have not
been through this intense kind of videotape-skull session that we run
with the team at this point."</TE>
<TE>   They have done all of this before, of course. They've played and
stopped, played and stopped, last year to a 15-1 postseason record,
drawn out as it was. Jackson still worries, however. Or, maybe,
prepares.</TE>
<TE>   "You lose that competitive edge, that veneer that you have that
carries the course of competitive drive," Jackson said. "The idea
that you're going to go back and remember this team viscerally, and
not just by videotape. That you actually know the fear of them and
the smell of them and whatever else that has the competitive edge
that you want to carry. It's a long wait.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes in the playoffs, in your subconscious, you're still
working things out with your opponent. This gives you a chance to
relax a little bit.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's been a day I felt I had to rebuild that energy toward
competition and being ... vigilant and execution conscious."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't play the game," he said, "until the game comes."</TE>
<TE>   And, so, on they go.</TE>

<LD>Two horses by what is now the most successful sire in the history of
quarter horse racing will be in action as Los Alamitos begins another
week of racing tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Full Court, who will try for the eighth time to break his maiden
in the fourth race, and 2-year-old filly Dashnlitia, who will run for
the first time in the fifth, are by First Down Dash, who recently
became the first quarter horse to surpass $40 million in progeny
earnings.</LD>
<LD>   Now 18, First Down Dash, the world champion in 1987 and a winner
of 13 of 15 starts, has fathered horses who, through last week, had
earned $40,016,170. Three of his offspring have emulated him and been
named world champions: Down With Debt (1994), Dashing Folly (1996)
and A Ransom (2000).</LD>
<TE>   A 4-year-old gelding, Full Court missed by a nose in his most
recent start at 870 yards and may be able to break through this
evening. In the following race, Dashnlitia will break from the rail
as she debuts for owner, breeder and trainer Blane Schvaneveldt.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Kid Charismatic. 2. Allegro AA. 3. The Dixie
Express. 4. Rail Skimmer. 5. Kiss My Kas Baby. 6. C R Fox. 7. A Star
Chic. 8. Nothing No Personal.</TE>
<TE>   Four! In the first, let's use Kid Charismatic and An Abducted
Chick, single Allegro AA in the second, use The Dixie Express, Ima
Big City Chick, Royal Azure Prince and Boo Master in the third and
Rail Skimmer, Brown Effort and Wired To Win in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Sophisticatedlady GVL drops in class and gets a
new rider in Alex Bautista as she makes her second career start for
Chuck Treece in the first, and Keno Cartel makes his first local
start for trainer R C Howell in the seventh, which is the fifth leg
in a pick six that has a carryover of $8,991.</TE>

<HD>Magic Takes Step to Hall</HD>
<DH>Basketball: Johnson, considered a shoo-in, is one of 24
finalists for induction. Worthy, Sharman and Winter are among the
other nominees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Magic Johnson, who ran the Showtime Lakers with exceptional and
enduring charisma, is a finalist for induction into the Naismith
Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, a mere detail on his way to
Springfield, Mass.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-three others--including Laker teammate James Worthy, Laker
assistant Tex Winter and Laker consultant Bill Sharman--also were
nominated Wednesday for induction. Sharman, already in the Hall of
Fame as a player, is a finalist as a coach and would join John Wooden
and Lenny Wilkens among those twice honored.</LD>
<LD>   The inductees will be announced June 5 at the Biltmore Hotel in
Los Angeles. The ceremony will be held Sept. 27.</LD>
<TE>   From the moment he retired--for a second time, after playing 32
games in the 1995-96 season--Johnson's inclusion in the Hall of Fame
was inevitable. He left as the game's all-time assists leader, though
John Stockton has since passed him. Johnson averaged 19.5 points and
11.2 assists, was a part of five NBA championships and was league MVP
three times.</TE>
<TE>   From a hotel room in Atlanta on Wednesday morning, Johnson said
the Hall of Fame, for the first time, felt "real."</TE>
<TE>   "It still has to be validated," he said. "But it's great. I can
feel the Laker tradition. I followed in the footsteps of so many
greats, from [George] Mikan on. Jerry [West] and Wilt [Chamberlain],
Elgin [Baylor], all those guys. Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar], then James and
myself. You just carry on the tradition of other guys. Then, of
course, there were the guys you patterned yourself after, like Oscar
[Robertson]."</TE>
<TE>   Worthy has been a finalist before. "He deserves to be in," Johnson
said. "James Worthy was not only great in the regular season, but he
was the best playoff player I've ever seen. If the other guys are
going to be in there, guys James competed against like Larry Bird and
Kevin McHale, he should be in there too. Nobody raised his game in
the playoffs like James Worthy. He should be in there."</TE>
<TE>   Winter, who turned 80 in February, has been nominated several
times before, only to be disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better than not being considered at all," he said Wednesday
morning. "I think it's more important to my family and my former
players than it is to me, actually."</TE>
<TE>   The finalists:</TE>
<TE>   Players: Johnson, Maurice Cheeks, Adrian Dantley, Bobby Jones,
Chet Walker and Worthy.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches: Larry Brown, Lefty Driesell, Lute Olson, Sharman, Eddie
Sutton.</TE>
<TE>   Contributors: Jerry Colangelo, Junius Kellogg, Winter, Harlem
Globetrotters.</TE>
<TE>   Veterans: Early Lloyd, Forrest Anderson, Grady Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Women: Cathy Rush, Kay Yow, Harley Redin.</TE>
<TE>   International: Dino Meneghin, Drazen Petrovic, Pedro Ferrandiz.</TE>

<KH>NAPA AUTO PARTS 500 California Speedway, Sunday, 11:30 a.m.,
Channel 11</KH>
<HD>OVERHEATING</HD>
<DH>Fighting Is Not New to Racing, but Some Have Started
Wondering About Its Impact</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brothers Donnie and Bobby Allison fighting Cale Yarborough in the
infield at the conclusion of the 1979 Daytona 500 is an image
galvanized by the first live television broadcast of a NASCAR race.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-three years later, Kevin Harvick leaps over a car in the
pits at Bristol, Tenn., locks a grip on Greg Biffle and unleashes his
anger over what had happened over the previous few hours.</LD>
<LD>   Hotheaded behavior has been a part of stock-car racing since its
inception. More than two decades after NASCAR's most famous fight,
television's role is bigger than ever. It magnifies every moment with
cameras in every corner, recording every push and shove on the race
track, every expletive shouted in anger in the garage.</LD>
<TE>   Will it happen again? Yes. Will it happen this weekend in the NAPA
Auto Parts 500 at California Speedway? Let's just say that Biffle and
Harvick are in the race, so don't discount anything.</TE>
<TE>   "Confrontations are going on less," said veteran driver Rusty
Wallace, who got in a heated exchange with Ricky Rudd last year in
Delaware. "The reason you hear about it more is because of the TV
coverage. They have live TV and radio shows every night. They'll talk
about it for two weeks."</TE>
<TE>   But are such heated, finger-pointing, testosterone-pumping
confrontations bad for the sport?</TE>
<TE>   Depends on whom you ask. Cal Wells, owner of the Tide Ford,
doesn't think so. Ricky Craven, who drives that car, does.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting on TV and barking and swearing at someone is something
you're always going to regret," Craven said. "It's not reasonable to
act that way and think you're going to have any future in the
business. I've always believed you stand up for what you believe in,
or you stand for nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "But every one of us has the potential to lose our temper, and how
you act in those few minutes is very important, and the damage that
can be done can offset months or years of progress or credibility
you've made. That's part of the consideration I try to give [to my
actions]."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, last year's race winner at Fontana, said physical contact
among drivers is rare, and it's the younger drivers who tend to get
involved.</TE>
<TE>   The 1984 rookie of the year said the Harvick-Biffle showdown "was
common practice in the old days. NASCAR has gotten polished."</TE>
<TE>   Wells finds little fault with Harvick confronting Biffle, but
plenty for the rough driving in a truck race a few weeks later that
led to Harvick's probation for the rest of the year, being parked for
the next day's Winston Cup race in Martinsville, Va., and a $35,000
fine. For what it's worth, Andy Hillenburg earned $35,405 for
finishing last in the race that Harvick missed.</TE>
<TE>   "Taking care of it outside the car is better than taking care of
it on the track where you're ramming into people," Wells said. "It's
not that I condone fighting, because I don't. Kevin Harvick and Robby
Gordon and Ricky Craven are who they are, and Ricky doesn't get in
fistfights; that's the way he is.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like Bobby Labonte."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Hunter began following NASCAR in the early 1960s as a writer
for the Atlanta Journal, was president of Darlington Raceway for nine
years and is now NASCAR's vice president of corporate communications.
He says Labonte, Johnny Benson and Mark Martin are probably the least
likely of Winston Cup's drivers to get caught in a postrace fray.</TE>
<TE>   "Professionals and gentlemen," Hunter said. "Some drivers are more
high strung than others. Tony Stewart is high strung. Kevin Harvick
is high strung. Jimmy Spencer is definitely high strung.</TE>
<TE>   "All of them, at this level, when they start the race on Sunday
are ready to go and aren't going to give an inch."</TE>
<TE>   And that's ultimately the problem, exacerbated by short tracks
where rubbing fenders is a way of life. Arguing over the apex of Turn
2 is no different than arguing over the inside corner of home plate.</TE>
<TE>   "How many times per week do you see a coach and umpire scream at
each other?" Wells said. "That's no different from Harvick. It's
common practice. It's a part of people expressing how committed they
are to a piece of real estate, whether it's hockey, basketball,
soccer, football, baseball or auto racing--but with auto racing, you
can't use a 3,400-pound object to prove your point."</TE>
<TE>   Because it's two miles in length, California Speedway is less
likely to have the serious bumping that precedes many postrace
altercations or, more appropriately, confrontations--they rarely come
to blows.</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly it's a lot of jawing and words, expletives, such as Jeff
Gordon and Tony Stewart at Watkins Glen, or Michael Waltrip and Lake
Speed after an incident [years ago] on the track," Hunter said. "All
of our drivers have been mad at Jimmy Spencer at one time or another.
But it's all words, never any fighting."</TE>
<TE>   Craven, who won his first race last year at Martinsville and led
36 laps there this season, is one of the most recent drivers to be
upset at Spencer: The two tangled twice at Martinsville. But Craven,
35, eschewed Harvick's approach and had a low-key conversation with
Spencer afterward expressing his disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember someone telling me when I first came into Winston Cup,
it's not always how you act, it's often times how you react," Craven
said. "I'm not going anywhere, and [Spencer's] going to stick around,
and we're both going to race together several more years. Racing
rivalries are healthy, but how you react is important.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm watching my 10-year-old girl play softball, and if she gets
hit by a pitch, I don't want her to charge the mound. How she handles
herself is pretty important."</TE>
<TE>   It can also be important for sponsors. Instead of finishing in the
top 10, or even winning at Martinsville, Craven finished 30th.</TE>
<TE>   "We were proud of the way he handled himself," said Molly Humbert,
a Tide spokeswoman. "Ultimately for Tide, because of our family
image, it really is important how our driver is viewed by fans.
Ricky's image is very important to Tide, and that's why he's such a
great fit, because of the way he handles himself on and off the
track."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's detergent, beer or auto products, sponsors also play
a role in this dynamic. But they are unlikely to issue ultimatums if
a driver fulfills the corporate agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "We want someone who's competitive on the track, who can interact
with fans, media and executives, someone who's comfortable in many
environments, whether it's a sit-down dinner or a hospitality tent,"
said Marc Spiegel, spokesman for Miller Brewing, which has been
associated with Wallace since 1989. "It's important how they handle
themselves in different emotional situations, but I also think you
realize some things happen in the heat of the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to look at the total picture and not look at
incidents individually. You have to look at what your driver does for
the sponsor and how they represent you as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   Sue Seaglund, manager of event marketing for GM Service and Parts
Operations--Harvick's sponsor--agreed. Arguing is a part of racing,
and confrontations are going to happen again, but hitting a car in
pit road or ramming another driver intentionally is unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "I was there [for the Biffle incident], and as a sponsor, was it
embarrassing and did I feel I had to hide, or have words with Kevin
or Richard Childress [the team owner]? No," she said. "That's a piece
of the exposure value of garnering this kind of attention.</TE>
<TE>   "When it was over, Kevin left and had an appearance at his
souvenir hauler--and he sold out."</TE>

<LD>When Dallas' big three is rolling, not even big nights by Kevin
Garnett and Wally Szczerbiak can slow the Mavericks down.</LD>
<LD>   Dirk Nowitzki, Michael Finley and Steve Nash forced the fast tempo
they love in leading the Mavericks past the Minnesota Timberwolves,
122-110, Wednesday night at Dallas to take a 2-0 lead in the
best-of-five first-round series.</LD>
<LD>   Game 3 is Sunday at Minnesota.</LD>
<TE>   Nowitzki had 31 points and 15 rebounds, Finley had 28 points and
eight rebounds and Nash had 17 points and 10 assists.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a confident team right now," Finley said. "We feel we can
go on the court and beat any team in the league."</TE>
<TE>   Dallas also got a boost from its two late-season additions as Nick
Van Exel scored 17 points and Raef LaFrentz had 14 points and 12
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   It all helped Dallas easily withstand Garnett's 31 points and 18
rebounds, and 25 points by Szczerbiak. Chauncey Billups also had 25.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 96, Toronto 91--Jerry Stackhouse showed he can still carry
the Pistons with his shooting.</TE>

<LD>Starting with a measure one committee member has labeled a baby step,
the NCAA is exploring added safety policies in an effort to avoid the
rash of football deaths that rocked the sport last year. The NCAA
board of directors will vote today on a one-year pilot proposal that
will allow incoming freshman football players who have signed a
letter of intent this year to participate in supervised voluntary
summer conditioning workouts with returning players.</LD>
<LD>   "This initiative has certainly been pushed by those concerns, no
question," said Grant Teaff, the former Baylor coach who serves as
executive director of the American Football Coaches Assn. "I think
we're moving toward complete supervision of all summer workouts. We
want to cover as much as we can humanly possibly look at on this
issue."</LD>
<LD>   Of the 17 football players who died last year, three played for
Division I teams. Florida State freshman linebacker DeVaughn Darling,
Florida freshman running back Eraste Autin and Northwestern senior
safety Rashidi Wheeler all died during off-season conditioning
drills.</LD>
<TE>   Autin's situation was the only one specific to the NCAA proposal.
He is believed to have suffered from heatstroke during a voluntary
practice July 19. Current rules forbid incoming freshmen from
practicing with returning players during voluntary summer drills. The
returning players' practice is conducted by the team's strength and
conditioning coach. The coach can design specific workouts for the
returning players, but he is restricted to inspecting the freshman
workouts for safety purposes only.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would allow all the players to train with the
strength and conditioning coach. The NCAA is also encouraging that
the unified workouts include the presence of a qualified assistant,
typically a trainer, who possesses "the unchallengeable authority to
cancel or modify the workout ... as appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of issues to address regarding safeguards for our
student-athletes and not one simple answer," said Dennis Poppe, the
NCAA senior director for football and baseball. "Here, we're looking
at helping a kid adequately acclimate himself for the rigors of
football practice."</TE>
<TE>   In typical NCAA style, the proposal was forwarded through a
deliberate process that included input from several committees,
including football issues, competitive safeguards, student-athletes
and football study oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Should it win approval, the pilot program will take effect along
with the NCAA's management council's endorsement of an educational
campaign intended to heighten awareness of off-season conditioning
issues, such as the impact of nutritional supplements, existing
medical conditions and hydration. Linda Will, the mother of
Northwestern's Wheeler, a La Verne Damien High graduate from Ontario,
has advocated additional measures. Will wants practice field
sidelines equipped with oxygen tanks, an operable telephone to reach
emergency personnel if necessary and a reasonable number of school
staff members who are CPR-trained. Will is suing Northwestern for the
wrongful death of her son, an asthmatic who collapsed while running
conditioning sprints in August.</TE>
<TE>   Said Michael Aguirre, a former wide receiver at Arizona State who
is a member of the Division I student-athlete advisory committee:
"I've been asked about making this more of a mandate. For now, we
need to see what our member schools come up with. We need a plan in
place that will maximize safety and preparation for the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime we are not providing proper care and safety to our
athletes, we need to look at ways to ensure it won't happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre said the management council's campaign includes a
recommendation for all universities to arrange a meeting before
summer workouts that will include the chancellor/president, the head
football coach, a few football players, a team physician and trainer
and a risk-management official to discuss a comprehensive safety
plan.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Poppe said the NCAA will push its member schools to
increase their emphasis on educating players about the dangers of
supplements and heat-related illnesses. Laronica Conway, the public
information coordinator for the NCAA, said athletes need to adopt a
basic philosophy before using supplements: "If you're unsure of what
you're taking, go ask the trainer." Wheeler and Darling had the
NCAA-banned supplement ephedrine in their system when they died.</TE>
<TE>   Personal accountability is also being stressed in the campaign.
Poppe said the attitude of playing hurt and pushing the body to the
brink of exhaustion is inherent to the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We need the student-athlete to commit to the idea that if he
doesn't feel well, it's OK to back off," Aguirre said. "I know that
voluntary workouts have a mandatory nature to them. Even when we're
told we don't have to work out, we think, 'I've got to, because UCLA
is doing it, Stanford is doing it, and I don't want to get behind.'
That kind of thinking is difficult to enforce."</TE>
<TE>   Said Teaff: "The good thing is a lot of people are taking a look
at this. This is the start of a long and winding road, but one we
need to trot."</TE>

<LD>Beginning with the 2003 NBA draft, high school basketball players
could be allowed to declare for the draft and even be picked without
giving up their college eligibility.</LD>
<LD>   The NCAA board of directors is expected to vote today at its
meeting in Indianapolis on a proposal to allow drafted players to
play college basketball as long as they don't sign with a
professional team or hire an agent.</LD>
<LD>   Under NBA rules, the rights to a drafted player who chose to
compete in college instead of signing immediately would remain with
the team until one year after the end of the player's college career.</LD>
<TE>   Current NCAA rules stipulate that a high school player who
declares for the professional draft loses his college eligibility,
even if he isn't drafted.</TE>
<TE>   College players who declare and aren't drafted are allowed to
return to school and continue their player careers, but if they are
drafted they lose their eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   In legislation related to football, the board is expected to
decide whether to tighten the criteria for schools to play Division
I-A football, including requirements that teams average at least
15,000 in attendance and play at least five games against Division
I-A opponents.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the group is expected to decide whether to lift the
moratorium on the number of postseason bowl games, and to declare
teams with records of 6-6 eligible to play in a bowl.</TE>

<LD>Shawn Bates was facing his first NHL penalty shot and most of his
teammates stayed far away.</LD>
<LD>   "You want to leave a guy with his mind," Alexei Yashin said.</LD>
<LD>   But captain Michael Peca wasn't shy. He grabbed Bates and told him
exactly what to look for against Toronto goalie Curtis Joseph.</LD>
<TE>   It worked, as Bates scored with 2:30 left in regulation Wednesday
night, giving New York a 4-3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs and
tying the Islanders' first playoff series in eight years.</TE>
<TE>   "I got good advice," Bates said with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   The Islanders came from behind in the third period to send the
series back to Toronto on Friday night tied, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   Game 6 is in Nassau Coliseum on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we can sneak one out Friday and close it out at home,"
Bates said.</TE>
<TE>   The Maple Leafs played without Mats Sundin, their captain and
leading scorer. The team would not divulge Sundin's injury, though
Coach Pat Quinn said it was to the "upper body."</TE>
<TE>   Bryan McCabe, a former Islander, dragged down Bates from behind to
give New York the penalty shot. After the whistle, Peca put himself
eye-to-eye with Bates and told him that Joseph is not fooled by
dekes.</TE>
<TE>   "I had experience," Peca said. "I told him I didn't want to tell
him what to do, I just wanted to tell him what to look for."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Bates felt sick to his stomach--"nerves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But after racing down ice, Bates quickly lifted the puck high past
Joseph's blocker.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't explain how I felt with words," said Bates, who got on
one knee and pumped his fist after scoring. "I'm pretty wired right
now."</TE>
<TE>   The goal capped a wild final seven minutes that saw New York tie
the score, take the lead, lose the lead and win it.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 3, Philadelphia 0--Patrick Lalime matched an NHL record at
Ottawa, Canada, with his third straight shutout.</TE>
<TE>   The win gave Ottawa a 3-1 lead in the Eastern Conference
best-of-seven quarterfinal. Game 5 is in Philadelphia on Friday
night.</TE>
<TE>   The Flyers are 0 for 11 in previous playoff series when they fall
behind three games to one.</TE>
<TE>   His 28-save performance gave Lalime a share of the NHL playoff
record for most consecutive shutouts with Brent Johnson of St. Louis,
who did it Tuesday night; Clint Benedict of the Montreal Maroons in
1926; John Ross Roach of the New York Rangers in 1929; and Frank
McCool of the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   It was Ottawa's third consecutive 3-0 shutout. The only shot to
beat Lalime came in Game 1 when the Flyers scored in overtime. The
NHL record for longest postseason shutout sequence is 248 minutes 32
seconds set by Detroit's Normie Smith in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   Wade Redden, Sami Salo and Marian Hossa scored for Ottawa and
Shawn McEachern had two assists.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 3, New Jersey 2--Kevin Weekes, playing for slumping
starter Arturs Irbe, stopped 40 shots, and Josef Vasicek scored the
winner 8:16 into overtime at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   The win by the Hurricanes gave them a 3-2 lead in the
best-of-seven Eastern Conference quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   The Devils led, 2-1, after Patrik Elias scored a power-play goal
with 8:14 left and the Hurricanes took another penalty three minutes
later.</TE>
<TE>   But Bobby Holik, who has been New Jersey's best player, was called
for boarding with 1:50 left. Jeff O'Neill broke out of his scoring
slump by pounding one past Martin Brodeur 21 seconds into the power
play.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 2, Phoenix 1--The Sharks wanted more punch on the power
play, and they got it.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Rathje broke an 0-for-20 string with San Jose's first
power-play goal since Game 1, and the Sharks held on for a victory at
Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   That pushed the Coyotes to the brink of their 10th consecutive
first-round playoff elimination since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Ricci got the winner, giving the Sharks a 2-0 lead. Radoslav
Suchy scored the only goal on Evgeni Nabokov, who continued his
mastery of Phoenix for his third win in the series.</TE>
<TE>   The previous season's rookie of the year, who had 35 saves in Game
3, stopped 29 shots.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A fan who had emergency brain surgery in January after being hit by a
hockey puck sued the Chicago Blackhawks, the NHL and the United
Center on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit filed on behalf of season-ticket holders Elizabeth and
Steven Hahn of LaGrange Park, Ill., alleges team, league and arena
officials knew for years that flying pucks were dangerous but did not
increase safety measures.</LD>
<LD>   Officials from the Blackhawks did not immediately return phone
calls seeking comment. The NHL declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, a 13-year-old fan attending an NHL game in Columbus,
Ohio, was killed after a deflected shot struck her. It was the first
such fatality in league history.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Hahn was hit by the puck while picking up a napkin Jan.
6 at a game between the Blackhawks and the Pittsburgh Penguins. She
was diagnosed with a blood clot on her brain and a severed right ear
lobe, according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian Burke, president and general manager of the Vancouver
Canucks, strongly criticized the officiating in his team's playoff
series with the Detroit Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   With the Canucks traveling back to Detroit for Game 5 tonight with
the series tied, 2-2, Burke said Wednesday his club is not getting a
fair shake.</TE>
<TE>   "We pay the same dues to the National Hockey League that Detroit
pays and even though we're just a little Canadian team, we deserve a
level playing field," Burke said. "We haven't gotten one yet and
we're sick of it."</TE>
<TE>   After four games, the Red Wings, who finished first overall in the
NHL with 116 points, had a 17-16 advantage in power plays over the
eighth-place Canucks. That included a 6-4 advantage for Vancouver in
Game 4.</TE>

<HD>Jeers Fuel Cardinals' Martinez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tino Martinez loved hearing the boos at Shea Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "I know the Mets fans respect what we've done," he said.</LD>
<LD>   While he still thinks of the Yankees as "we," on Wednesday night
Martinez sparked his new team, the St. Louis Cardinals, to a 4-2
victory over the Mets at New York that ended a five-game losing
streak.</LD>
<TE>   Martinez, batting only .161 with seven runs batted in before the
game, had three hits. He drove in St. Louis' first run with a double
and had a single ahead of pinch-hitter Eduardo Perez's tiebreaking
two-run homer in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Manager Tony La Russa wasn't sure about starting the
left-handed-hitting Martinez against Al Leiter (2-1). Martinez was
three for 20 against the left-hander with one extra-base hit.</TE>
<TE>   "When a guy is working really hard to get hits, Leiter is not a
guy to get well against," La Russa said.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez spoke with La Russa, then asked Cardinal starter Darryl
Kile (1-0) whether he wanted him in the lineup. Kile said sure, and
Martinez gave the go-ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez shortened his swing, doubling to left in the second on a
slider he flicked into short left.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 1-1, in the eighth, Martinez sent a 1-and-1
curveball into short center, ending Leiter's streak of 16 consecutive
batters retired. Booed even more loudly in the ninth by the crowd of
22,938, Martinez singled against David Weathers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm enjoying it," Martinez said. "I love playing here. It's a
great atmosphere. The fans are really intense."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 7, Philadelphia 2--Tom Lampkin homered, doubled and
drove in three runs at Philadelphia to end an 0-for-39 drought by San
Diego catchers.</TE>
<TE>   Lampkin, who was one for 33 before the game, homered in the second
inning against Robert Person (0-3) and had a run-scoring double in
the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Lawrence (3-1) gave up two runs and six hits in 62/3
innings, striking out four and walking one. Lawrence had a three-hit
shutout before giving up a home run to Tomas Perez with one out in
the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Arizona 3--Catcher Henry Blanco didn't start. John
Foster didn't even expect to be in Atlanta. Together, they helped the
Braves finally beat the Diamondbacks at Turner Field.</TE>
<TE>   Blanco, who came in after Javy Lopez was injured, drove in the
tiebreaking run with a hit in the eighth inning and Foster (1-0),
called up from triple-A earlier in the day, won in his major league
debut. He pitched a hitless eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's awesome," Foster said. "All of this in one day. First,
getting called up. Then, getting the win."</TE>
<TE>   The Braves had lost seven in a row at home to the Diamondbacks,
including three in last year's NL championship series.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 7, Florida 4--Roy Oswalt was coughing, sniffling, sneezing
and struggling to breathe before his start. He may have felt ill, but
he didn't look it against the Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   Oswalt (3-0) gave up five hits in seven solid innings, and Lance
Berkman hit his major league-leading 10th home run to lead the Astros
at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Oswalt won for the first time in three starts. He gave up two
runs, one earned, struck out eight and walked four.</TE>
<TE>   He lowered his earned-run average to 1.91 in 33 innings and
extended his scoreless streak to 18 innings, until Charles Johnson
ended it with a run-scoring double in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 10, San Francisco 4--Fred McGriff drove in a season-high
four runs at Chicago and Joe Borowski got his first victory since
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Bellhorn had a two-run homer for the Cubs, who won for only
the second time in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   David Bell hit a solo homer and Tsuyoshi Shinjo drove in two runs
for the Giants, who were without Barry Bonds</TE>
<TE>   With the temperature dropping, a wet field and a day game today,
Bonds got the night off to rest his sore hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 4, Colorado 3--Juan Encarnacion's two-out single in the
bottom of the ninth inning lifted the Reds in a rain-delayed game
that ended at 12:45 a.m. EDT.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 100 fans were huddled in the stands--most of them
plopped back in their plastic chairs--when the Reds scored against
Jose Jimenez (0-2), the fifth Rocky pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Austin Kearns had a broken-bat single, was bunted to second and
moved to third on Brady Clark's groundout. After Barry Larkin was
intentionally walked, Encarnacion lined a single to center.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Williamson (1-0) escaped threats in the eighth and ninth for
his first victory since Aug. 12, 2000. Williamson, the NL's rookie of
the year in 2000, sat out most of last season because of elbow
surgery.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>The Montreal Expos found yet another way to win Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Milwaukee rookie center fielder Alex Sanchez dropped Jose Vidro's
two-out liner in the bottom of the 15th inning to allow the winning
run to score, giving the Expos a 5-4 victory.</LD>
<LD>   "He catches that ball 99 times out of 100," Brewer right fielder
Jeffrey Hammonds said. "Tonight was that one."</LD>
<TE>   The Expos won their fifth in a row and opened a two-game lead in
the NL East.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good and I didn't do anything tonight," Expo Manager Frank
Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   After each team scored in the 12th, Mike Mordecai led off the
Montreal 15th with a double against Jose Cabrera (1-3). Brad
Wilkerson bunted Mordecai to third and pinch-hitter Michael Barrett
was walked intentionally.</TE>
<TE>   Barrett took second on defensive indifference before Peter
Bergeron struck out for the second out.</TE>
<TE>   Vidro followed with a liner, and Sanchez ran in to make the catch,
but the ball glanced off his glove and dropped behind him for an
error as Mordecai crossed the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost a shame to see the game end the way it did, on an
error," Mordecai said. "You'd like it to be a clean hit. But you know
what, we'll take it any way we can get it."</TE>
<TE>   T.J. Tucker (1-0) pitched three scoreless innings for the victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos' winning streak is their longest since they took six in
a row in 2000. The game drew an announced 5,295, only the fifth crowd
over 5,000 in 12 games at Olympic Stadium this season.</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS PORTLAND vs. LAKERS: SERIES REPORT/OTHER VIEWS</KH>
<HD>Continuity Isn't Name of Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK CULPEPPER</AU>
<BD>PORTLAND OREGONIAN</BD>
<DL>PALM SPRINGS</DL>
<LD>Long ago in a ghost town far away--downtown L.A.--Portland and the
Lakers played Game 1, a game so bygone it was possible in the interim
to simply drift off.</LD>
<LD>   That's drift off as in snooze, a possibility both during the game
and afterward, and drift off as in just start driving and wind up
lounging in a senior-citizen paradise, mainly as a method of
acknowledging the ancient Utah Jazz's shocking victory at Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   Game 1 in Los Angeles did feature some themes, but occurred so
long ago it proved wise to write them down.</LD>
<TE>   Here's one: the Kobe-stopper. Portland's Ruben Patterson had
trumpeted his ability to frustrate Laker phenom Kobe Bryant, so Laker
fans, in a failed attempt to lend the series flavor, proved again
that fan bases are actually tribes. They booed Patterson repeatedly
not for any breach of the law--they wouldn't know or care--but
because he said something unworshipful about one of their fold.</TE>
<TE>   The Kobe-stopper helped hold Bryant to 10-of-28 shooting, a boon,
yet Bryant still scored 34 points, a bust.</TE>
<TE>   It seems that, back around Game 1, somebody said something about
Portland Coach Maurice Cheeks asking employee Rasheed Wallace to
occasionally guard the gigantic Shaquille O'Neal, an effort that
might erode Wallace's offense. "It will" erode Wallace's offense,
Phil Jackson said. "It's a load."</TE>
<TE>   Like many--no, wait, all--coaches, however, Cheeks isn't flush
with luxuries about guarding O'Neal. Give him marks for innovation,
even while O'Neal hilariously takes responsibility for chasing
Arvydas Sabonis back to Lithuania and vows he'd happily do it again.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's offense calls to mind the box score, even though it's
yellowed and frayed and barely legible by now. The archaic document
notes a sublime offensive game from Portland reserve Derek Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   This makes sense, because any wise team would anoint Anderson a
spiritual leader. Well, of course he came through. What's less
sensible--beat the old drum--is the makeup of the Trail Blazers,
whereby Anderson can get hot in the second quarter, but on the next
cluster of offensive plays, teammates don't look for him because they
have so many other capable alpha males to feed.</TE>
<TE>   It rings in the head somewhere that Bonzi Wells, marvelous young
player, had a Game 1 more young than marvelous, totally forgivable,
and could alter Game 2. It's barely familiar that Scottie Pippen,
marvelous old player, spent Game 1 bolstering the theory that Jackson
resides in his head, mostly forgivable, given the perpetual weirdness
of opposing his old coach.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, none of the above matters a whit if Portland can't
puncture the Lakers' sense of invulnerability. We watch, toothpicks
in eyes, just in case this ever happens and we suddenly find
ourselves startled wide awake.</TE>

<LD>First things first.</LD>
<LD>   I believe Jerry West is going to Memphis.</LD>
<LD>   I also believe mutton-chopped fat guys moonlighting in satin suits
are Elvis, and those who make more than minimum wage can sing the
blues.</LD>
<TE>   Don't get me wrong. There is no doubt that reports from that
genteel Tennessee burg--when Jason Williams is out of town,
anyway--are accurate.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, right now, Jerry West is going to work for the Memphis
Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, somebody there actually believed it enough to leak it.</TE>
<TE>   No, I don't blame the locals for trumpeting this with a pitched
fervor generally accorded the occasional news that somebody has been
spotted watching the Liberty Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The Grizzlies are a tear-down. Jerry West is The Cement Mixer From
Cabin Creek.</TE>
<TE>   The Grizzlies are trying to sell the NBA in a college town. Jerry
West is the NBA logo.</TE>
<TE>   It's a match made in, if not heaven, then a canoe piloted by Burt
Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   Except the Memphis folks don't know Jerry like we know Jerry.</TE>
<TE>   They don't realize that the instincts that make him so brilliant
are also the demons that make him so volatile.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't there at that news conference many years ago when he
was announced as the Laker head coach ... then turned down the job on
the spot.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't there to hear him tearfully discuss his retirement as
general manager ... more than a year before he actually retired.</TE>
<TE>   This is a man so intense, yet so exacting, he can jubilantly say
yes one minute, then emphatically say no the next minute.</TE>
<TE>   And mean both things.</TE>
<TE>   He has done this a thousand times involving things far less
emotional than this, the potential end of his association with the
only place this 63-year-old man has worked his entire life.</TE>
<TE>   West attended a Laker playoff game Sunday, looking more relaxed
than I've seen him in years.</TE>
<TE>   He's going to give that up to work for a flighty owner, Michael
Heisley, who treats his franchise like a used car lot?</TE>
<TE>   He's going to try to win with a payroll that includes some $80
million committed to--gasp--Jason Williams and Michael Dickerson?</TE>
<TE>   He's going to give up the first tee for last place? Tenure for
tension? Sainthood for the salvage business?</TE>
<TE>   I won't believe the most enduring Laker will become a Grizzly
until I see him standing at a Memphis podium.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to the second thing.</TE>
<TE>   If West does take the job, I'll be cheering for him. And I won't
be booing the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Before criticizing Jerry Buss for allowing West to leave,
understand that West has already left, and retirement was his idea.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, West, despite making millions, has always been angry that
Buss wouldn't give him a piece of the team like he gave Magic
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   But West was so frazzled when he retired two years ago, he told me
there was no amount of money that Buss could give him to stay.</TE>
<TE>   And, certainly, he was uncomfortable with Phil Jackson's role,
both on the sidelines and at the side of Buss' daughter Jeanie.</TE>
<TE>   But by the time he walked away, he said his health was more
important than any of that.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, West is one of the only people in town who didn't watch
the Lakers' Game 7 comeback against the Portland Trail Blazers in the
2000 Western Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't bear the stress. He was 100 miles away, at a movie
theater, watching "Gladiator."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, now, West is mentally ready to go back to work.</TE>
<TE>   But clearly too, the Lakers are not a place that could offer him
much comfort or competitive stimulation.</TE>
<TE>   West has never worked well when he's not the biggest guy in the
room. But that room now contains Jackson, a giant ironically hired by
West when he realized his feuding stars couldn't win without him.</TE>
<TE>   West also loves a last-to-first challenge. But plugging in one
power forward and a backup point guard every year--the current duty
of West-anointed General Manager Mitch Kupchak--is not exactly that
sort of challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the Lakers could offer West his old job back.</TE>
<TE>   But why would he want it?</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the king of the playground needs to see if he can do it
on another playground.</TE>
<TE>   This could be one of those times.</TE>
<TE>   It would be nice if West could wait for two years until his
consultant's deal runs out, then join the Clippers. Or maybe he could
wait until the Lakers need rebuilding again, and reclaim his old
office.</TE>
<TE>   But age, and a competitive nature, apparently dictate that he
wants to do something now.</TE>
<TE>   And if so, good for him.</TE>
<TE>   If he wants to take this one last halfcourt shot--and believe me,
this is longer than the one against the Knicks in 1970--he should be
allowed to do so in peace.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, it will be hard to see Jerry West working somewhere else.
Making decisions that could actually hurt the Lakers. Enduring the
sort of losing that is so unlike him. Creating and fretting on the
other side of the country.</TE>
<TE>   It will be weird to hear rumors--and almost immediately, there
will be rumors--that Kobe Bryant is trying to figure out a way to
join him.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be much fun for us. But if West wants this opportunity,
shouldn't his fans want it for him? And is this really the fault of
the Lakers?</TE>
<TE>   Not that West wants it. Maybe he does. Maybe he doesn't. I tried
to reach him Wednesday. He wasn't talking. I wasn't blaming him.</TE>
<TE>   However this thing ends up, it's going to sound like something out
of a song.</TE>
<TE>   The Memphis folks would guess B.B. King.</TE>
<TE>   I'm still betting on the Beach Boys.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura Buena softball program has forfeited a victory and the
school has suspended sixth-year Coach Amy Hall for the remainder of
the season for violating Southern Section rules, Athletic Director
Joe Vaughan said.</LD>
<LD>   According to Vaughan, Buena was scheduled to play two games during
the Arroyo Grande tournament on April 6. A Buena player was ejected
after a controversial play at home plate during a 2-1 victory over
Arroyo Grande. By rule, that player must not be present for the next
game. Hall decided to not play the second game.</LD>
<LD>   Because Buena did not play the second game, the penalty carried
over to Buena's next game, a 4-0 victory over Santa Barbara in which
the ineligible athlete played, forcing forfeiture of the victory.</LD>
<TE>   Co-coach Glen Allen, who is in his first year, will remain as
coach but is on probation.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're doing in the case of both [coaches] is we'll evaluate
their status after the season," Vaughan said. "[Hall] wasn't trying
to be malicious, but it was definitely an error in judgment."</TE>

<BD>From staff reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Southern Section council will vote on two potentially landmark
transfer proposals at its regular meeting, which begins at 9 a.m.
today at The Grand in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The first proposal would prohibit students who transfer without
moving from participating in varsity sports for one year, beginning
with the 2003-04 school year. Students who transfer would be eligible
to compete at levels below varsity or in sports they haven't
previously played in high school.</LD>
<LD>   The second proposal would require school officials to certify that
no one connected with their booster clubs or athletic programs had
contact with transfers. The latter proposal also requires approval by
the California Interscholastic Federation federated council at its
meeting in May. If approved, the proposal would go into effect for
the 2002-03 school year.</LD>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New courts, please.</LD>
<LD>   The phrase is not part of any U.S. Tennis Assn. advertising
promotion, but it sums up another campaign going on in Ojai, site of
this week's 102nd Ojai Valley tennis tournament.</LD>
<LD>   A push to rebuild the four aging tennis courts in upper Libbey
Park and another at the lower, south end is expected to begin in
October and be finished in time for next year's tournament.</LD>
<TE>   The project, which will cost about $250,000, has moved ahead at
the behest of the Ojai Valley Tennis Club, one of three civic groups
providing financial support for the effort.</TE>
<TE>   The Ojai Planning Commission last week recommended that the city
council approve the installation of new high-performance lights that
will allow for night play and the possibility of televising matches.
Cost for eight light banks on each of the four upper courts is
estimated at $45,000.</TE>
<TE>   For the past eight years, the four 80-year-old courts at the north
end of Libbey Park and the 26-year-old courts at the south end have
required nearly annual filling of cracks, and re-sanding and
re-painting of the areas at costs ranging from $1,500-$2,000 a court.</TE>
<TE>   The Ojai Civic Assn. will contribute about $210,000 to the
reconstruction. The city of Ojai and Santa Rosa residents Herb and
Jane Dwight, who pledged to donate under the auspices of the Ojai
Valley Tennis Club, are adding about $70,000 each. Herb Dwight is a
retired businessman and former member of the Stanford University
board of trustees.</TE>
<TE>   New courts will be welcomed by Pacific 10 Conference coaches and
officials. The Pac-10 individual championships are played at Libbey
Park in conjunction with the Ojai tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times, we're at country clubs and things are real nice,
and then suddenly we're in this public park," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "While there's lots of ambience and tradition, it is the
conference championships."</TE>
<TE>   The need for new courts became apparent in 1999, when patching was
completed a few weeks before the tournament, only to be undone by
weather conditions that caused raised cracks and ridges on courts.</TE>
<TE>   "People could trip over it. It was pretty bad," said Wayne Bruce,
a retired civil engineer and Ojai Valley Tennis Club member involved
in the resurfacing.</TE>
<TE>   Tournament officials called in a contractor and work crew, which
used sledgehammers to pound down and smooth away raised, jagged edges
of the cracks. The salvage job was finished the day before the
tournament began.</TE>

two furlongs to make the move, and I did. Sure enough, she knew what
she was talking about," which is really strange, because that makes
her unlike any editor I know.</LD>
<TE>   Did she mention anything about "off with your head" if you failed,
I said, because that would tell us if she has the mentality to be an
editor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A FEW years ago, a sportswriter looked at Stevens cross-eyed, and
Stevens wrestled him to the ground--in a bowling alley. The Queen was
safe, of course, because she doesn't bowl or make fun of someone
wearing a bowling shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously I had to be concerned when Stevens and I met, but I was
relieved to see he wasn't wearing his bowling shirt. "I'm a little
testy today," said Stevens, and that's all I needed--a miniature
Kevin Brown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW AFTER the raucous and uproarious past few days with the Kings
and all their obnoxious fans, what I really needed was some peace and
quiet, so I went to Hollywood Park for opening day. This is a place
so down on its luck that free parking and admission fail to draw a
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The main tote board wasn't working, because what's the sense of
turning it on for just a few people? I counted three more jockeys
than patrons at one point.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're riding down the stretch and you can hear the sound of
your whip echoing through the empty grandstand, it's not very
exciting," Stevens said, and I should have told him, "try betting on
your horse, like I did in the seventh, and then watch you ride that
slowpoke home in last place--did you ever think about using the whip,
you little shrimp?"</TE>
<TE>   I kept my thoughts to myself, however, because when I go bowling I
don't want to spend the whole night looking over my shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WEDNESDAY WAS the first day in California history when you could
watch the final four races from Hollywood Park on TV--including
Stevens' last-place finish by a mile--wager, collect and not leave
home. Apparently that's what most people did.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks drew 3,594 more fans to their opener last season than
Hollywood Park did Wednesday, and the Sparks charged admission.
Hollywood's attendance of 7,851 free customers was the lowest opening
day crowd in the track's history--and that's dating to 1938.</TE>
<TE>   "Horse racing missed the boat a while back. When all the other
major sports were advertising and promoting their product, we didn't
feel the need for it. Now that boat has sailed," Stevens said, and
for a guy who rides horses, he sure has some fixation on boat racing.
"It's like trying to win a race when you start 20 lengths back."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe you ought to go to the whip, I thought, but I didn't say it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE SPORT, of course, needs more of Stevens, not only plodding
down the stretch--you can go to the whip any time now--but standing
before the cameras and the guys with the notebooks. Like Chris
McCarron, Eddie Delahoussaye and Laffit Pincay, these are the stars,
and racing's last hope for rejuvenation.</TE>
<TE>   There aren't going to be any more great horses, and even if there
is an animal capable of grabbing the headlines for a year or so, the
money that comes from breeding is too big a lure to allow a horse to
hang around and lose its appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The tug-of-war that goes on between owner and trainer egos does
more to detract from the sport than help it, bringing me right back
to the jocks' room, and the little guys who are every bit as talented
at what they do as Kobe Bryant, Adrian Beltre and Jason Allison.
Would you bet on Allison scoring tonight?</TE>
<TE>   Stevens has a new book in stores, "The Perfect Ride," which has
him beating a childhood disease to become a Hall of Fame jockey. If
the racing industry could capture and capitalize on the passion he
has for the sport, you might have people pulling for him, and thereby
pulling them to the track.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll do whatever it takes to promote this sport," Stevens said.
"People aren't showing up anymore, but maybe this new TV thing will
give some new people a chance to see us little guys, and get them
interested in coming to the track and giving us a closer look."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe horse racing should consider a new marketing theme: "Your
alternative is to give the Sparks a closer look."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE'S A horse named "Spinelessjellyfish" running this weekend,
and because an e-mailer this week called me a "spineless jelly fish,"
I think they were trying to tell me something.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHO IS going to be eliminated first--the Kings or the Angels?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M WITH the Kings all the way in Denver tonight, but to be
honest, I shaved Wednesday. It's my job to get the news for the
readers, and I didn't want to put off any of the Playmates with my
scruffy look. I was just thinking of you people.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Larry S.</TE>
<TE>   "Salma Hayek has a huge diamond ring from Ed Norton, and while
everything is still hush-hush, people noticed it when they were at a
recent Laker game. They were even spotted kissing."</TE>
<TE>   But whom was she thinking about?</TE>

<HD>Another Bad Break for England</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>England's World Cup hopes suffered their second serious blow in as
many weeks Wednesday when defender Gary Neville broke a bone in his
foot during Manchester United's 2-2 tie with Bayer Leverkusen of
Germany in the semifinals of the European Champions League.</LD>
<LD>   The injury is identical to the one suffered by midfielder David
Beckham, Neville's Manchester United and England teammate, exactly
two weeks earlier in the quarterfinals of the same competition.</LD>
<LD>   "Believe it or not, it's the same [injury] as David's," said
Manchester United Coach Alex Ferguson. "It's unbelievable, absolutely
incredible."</LD>
<TE>   Neville, 27, suffered the injury 17 minutes into the game when he
tackled Leverkusen forward Ze Roberto. Neville is expected to be
sidelined for six to eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   England's first World Cup game is against Sweden on June 2.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer Leverkusen twice came from behind to earn the tie and leave
the German Bundesliga leader in excellent position to advance to the
May 15 final after it hosts the second game in the home-and-home
semifinal series on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Norway's Ole Gunnar Solskjaer gave Manchester United the lead half
an hour into the match with a goal that deflected in off defender
Boris Zivkovic, and United still led after an hour.</TE>
<TE>   In the 62nd minute, however, Leverkusen and Germany midfielder
Michael Ballack chipped United's France '98 World Cup-winning
goalkeeper, Fabien Barthez, to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd of 66,534 at Old Trafford in Manchester was brought to
its feet five minutes later when Roberto tripped United's Ruud van
Nistelrooy and the Dutch striker scored from the penalty spot to
restore Manchester's lead.</TE>
<TE>   Leverkusen's substitute Oliver Neuville tied the match in the 75th
minute, however, and the two away goals could be vital as Coach Klaus
Toppmoeller's team tries to reach its first European Champions League
final in the same season that should see it win its first German
league title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona, which lost, 2-0, to Real Madrid on Tuesday in the other
semifinal, received more bad news Wednesday when the Catalan club
discovered that Dutch defender Michael Reiziger had suffered a thigh
muscle injury in that game and probably will miss the return game in
Madrid on May 1.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Russia will bid to stage the 2008 European Championship even
though it has not received any government backing for the move,
Alexander Tukmanov, executive director of the Russian Football Union,
told Reuters Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have time to persuade our government," Tukmanov said. "I
think that they simply cannot ignore the wishes of our people who
overwhelmingly voted in favor of the Euro 2008 bid."</TE>
<TE>   There are six other bidders, with the favorite being the four-way
Scandinavian bid that would split the tournament between Denmark,
Sweden, Finland and Norway.</TE>
<TE>   The 2004 European Championship will be played in Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme, who has led Boca Juniors of
Argentina to successive Libertadores Cup titles in the last two
years, has declined to travel to Ecuador, where Boca plays El
Nacional in Quito tonight, because he fears for his family's safety.</TE>
<TE>   Riquelme's 17-year-old brother, Cristian, was kidnapped earlier
this month but released 24 hours later. The family declined to
comment on whether any ransom had been paid.</TE>
<TE>   "This situation has deeply affected him and he believes they [his
family] are in danger, so he is making them his priority," a Boca
Juniors spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Riquelme, who is on the fringe of Argentina's World Cup squad, was
expected to join Barcelona next season, but now is being linked with
Atletico Madrid, which is about to gain promotion back to the first
division.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While the United States is being given a World Cup send-off in
Foxboro, Mass., where it plays the Netherlands on May 19, Mexico will
be given a similar and perhaps even louder send-off at the Coliseum
that same afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Lynch, general manager of the Coliseum, said Wednesday that AC
Milan of Italy will be the final opponent for Coach Javier Aguirre's
team before it leaves for Japan and first-round games against
Croatia, Ecuador and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   The May 19 game will kick off at 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paraguay Coach Cesare Maldini, the father of Italy World Cup
veteran defender Paolo Maldini, returns to South America today, one
week after Paraguay was crushed, 4-0, by England in a World Cup
warmup game.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Maldini has been taken to task by the media in Paraguay
for making a side trip to Italy after the defeat instead of returning
with the team.</TE>
<TE>   A Paraguayan Football Assn. spokesman downplayed the debate,
however.</TE>
<TE>   "The defeat was among the possibilities we had foreseen,"
Guillermo Battilana said. "There's no need to become desperate
because of last week's match. The coach had asked to play against
England to see what stage the team is at."</TE>
<TE>   Paraguay plays South Africa, Spain and Slovenia in the first round
of the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Tony Meola earned the shutout and Kansas City got goals
from Carrey Talley and Chris Brown on Wednesday night as the Wizards
defeated Santos Laguna of Mexico, 2-0, in Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   The result gave the Wizards a 3-2 aggregate victory in the
two-game series and advanced them to the semifinal round of the
CONCACAF Champions Cup.</TE>

<HD>Waves Looking to Keenan as the Postseason Begins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pepperdine has faced many challenges on the way to its 26-4 record
and No. 1 ranking in college men's volleyball.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Keenan, the Waves' best player, has met many of them at the
net. The 6-foot, 8-inch junior has been an integral part in the
Waves' success, leading them on a path that may end in their first
NCAA championship in 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   Brigham Young presents the latest challenge. The Cougars (23-6)
are the defending national champion and they face the top-seeded
Waves today at 5 in a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament
semifinal at Pepperdine's Firestone Fieldhouse.</LD>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara (18-10) plays Hawaii (21-7) in the other
semifinal at 7:30.</TE>
<TE>   Keenan, a middle blocker, is a leading contender for MPSF player
of the year and national player of the year honors.</TE>
<TE>   He leads the Waves in blocks with 1.83 a game, ranks fourth in
kills at 2.94 a game and has one of the most effective jump serves in
the college ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine Coach Marv Dunphy said Keenan's defense at the net
might be his greatest ability. It has more to do with his knowledge
of the opposition than his imposing frame.</TE>
<TE>   "He became a much better read blocker," Dunphy said. "There's a
reaction time and a movement time.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how late a blocker goes, they have to go the right way.
Reading a play is a big part of it and I give him credit. Brad has
improved his eye work to where he can read a play as it develops and
get himself to the spot."</TE>
<TE>   Keenan credits the coaching staff of Dunphy, Jeff Stork and Rick
McLaughlin with his improvement. He said Pepperdine's coaches were
the main reasons he turned down other schools to come to Malibu after
being an All-Southern Section player at Fountain Valley High.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working with Jeff all season in terms of getting my
blocking down and blocking the ball with success," he said. "Marv has
really been working with me on my serve to where it's kind of become
a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of all, I think I've improved because we spend so much time
in preparation. We watch tapes and analyze a team's tendencies to the
most minute detail. By match time, we already know what that team is
going to do."</TE>
<TE>   Dunphy, who took a year off to be an assistant coach with the U.S.
Olympic team in 2000, said Keenan is a player Team USA should be
tracking.</TE>
<TE>   "They have talked to him about being involved in the program,"
Dunphy said. "There are some players who specialize in one thing but
you really need to have a well-rounded game at that level.</TE>
<TE>   "Brad can do several things well. He can pass the ball; I don't
think he's had a ball-handling error this season."</TE>
<TE>   Keenan said the chance to play for the U.S. team is a goal for the
future.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to jump the gun but I do look forward to getting an
opportunity to prove myself on that level," he said.</TE>
<TE>   First, though, he wants to help keep Pepperdine on a roll. The
Waves haven't lost since Feb. 21, a two-month span that has included
14 consecutive victories.</TE>
<TE>   Keenan said a two-match sweep against Hawaii March 22-23 convinced
him the Waves might be something special.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't really sure how we would look at the start of the
season," he said. "We had a new setter in Beau Daniels and a new
outside hitter in Sean Rooney. I kind of thought it would take some
time to come together as a team but as time went on, we started to
win and rise more and more [in the polls].</TE>
<TE>   "Sweeping Hawaii at home definitely was one of the top moments of
our season."</TE>
<TE>   As the Waves push toward a possible national title, the pressure
will build with each match.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's match may be the most important. The MPSF champion will
get an automatic berth into the four-team NCAA tournament and the
conference runner-up is likely to get the one at-large spot.</TE>
<TE>   Dunphy acknowledges that Pepperdine hasn't hoisted a trophy in
some time.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year we don't win it seems too long," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Keenan insists he doesn't feel the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "We've said all year that the most important game is our next
game," he said. "Right now, our big game is against BYU."</TE>

<HD>'Baretta' Pair May Be Called to Testify</HD>
<DH>Crime: Blake's lawyer says two stuntmen on the
prosecution's witness list will say that the actor attempted to hire
them to kill his wife.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors will try to prove that Robert Blake attempted to recruit
two stuntmen from his 1970s television series, "Baretta," to kill his
wife, his defense lawyer said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Harland W. Braun said both stuntmen are listed as
prosecution witnesses against the actor and that part of his defense
strategy will be to show that neither is credible.</LD>
<LD>   "These kinds of witnesses are always suspect," he said. "If
someone really solicited you for a murder, why didn't you call
police?"</LD>
<TE>   Blake has pleaded not guilty to fatally shooting 44-year-old Bonny
Lee Bakley on May 4, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said he learned about stuntmen Gary Raymond McLarty and
Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton through a search warrant executed Friday at
Blake's Hidden Hills home.</TE>
<TE>   Braun also received 12 boxes of documents from prosecutors Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and Los Angeles
Police Department declined to comment on possible witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to protect the integrity of this investigation, the LAPD
will neither at this time, nor any time in the future, be releasing
details or names of those involved in the case," Sgt. John
Pasquariello said in a statement Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   McLarty was a defense witness in another high-profile Hollywood
trial involving the 1982 deaths of actor Vic Morrow and two children
on the "Twilight Zone" movie set. Braun represented director Jon
Landis, who was acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later in 1991, McLarty shot and killed a roommate at
his Lake View Terrace home. Authorities ruled the shooting an act of
self-defense because the roommate threatened to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said the two stuntmen contend that Blake tried to hire them
to kill Bakley.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations are similar to those in a criminal complaint filed
Monday against Blake and his bodyguard, Earle Caldwell, who were
arrested April 18 in connection with the killing of Bakley in Studio
City.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said Los Angeles police looked for photographs of McLarty
and Hambleton in the homes of Blake and Caldwell. Police searched
both homes shortly after Bakley's killing and on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, 68, pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of murder,
soliciting murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He is being held
without bail at the Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell, 46, pleaded not guilty to a charge of conspiracy to
commit murder and is being held in lieu of $1-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   In the criminal complaint, prosecutors Patrick R. Dixon and
Gregory A. Dohi allege that Blake asked one person, whose identity
was not revealed, to hide in Blake's van in a desert area and kill
Bakley in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The same month, Blake asked a second unidentified person to kill
Bakley as she sat in a parked car near Bullhead City, Ariz., the
complaint states.</TE>
<TE>   Gary McLarty's wife, Karen McLarty, said Wednesday that her
husband was reluctant to comment on the case before checking with
detectives.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't want to be bombarded by people," she said.</TE>
<TE>   McLarty, 61, who was Morrow's stunt double in the "Twilight Zone"
movie, testified at that trial that he personally warned Landis that
the scene should be scaled down. The three victims were killed when a
helicopter crashed during the filming of a battle scene.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie Rondell, a longtime stunt coordinator who often worked with
McLarty over his four-decade career in Hollywood, described him as
dedicated to his craft.</TE>
<TE>   "In his prime, the man was a terrific stuntman," Rondell said. "He
was an all-around talent. He did horses, fights and falls. He also
was one of the very best drivers in the business."</TE>
<TE>   Rondell said McLarty and Hambleton worked on several episodes of
"Baretta" and that Blake was friendly with all the stunt people on
the show.</TE>
<TE>   "There were literally more than 100 stunt people that worked on
the show," Rondell said.</TE>
<TE>   Hambleton, 65, is awaiting trial next month in San Bernardino
County on misdemeanor charges of exhibiting a firearm and resisting a
police officer in 1999 in Victorville, according to district attorney
and court records. He could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Reversal of Death Sentence Is Upheld</HD>
<DH>Appeal: A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit disagrees
with the state Supreme Court's ruling.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that a Fullerton man
convicted of a 1982 Orange County murder should not be executed
because he received constitutionally deficient representation at the
penalty phase of his trial.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco,
overturning a 1996 California Supreme Court decision, said that John
Visciotti, 45, should be given a term of life without possibility of
parole or a new sentencing hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday's ruling marked the ninth time since November that the
9th Circuit has either reversed a death sentence or upheld the
decision of a federal trial judge who had overturned a death
sentence.</LD>
<TE>   In this instance, the court affirmed a decision of U.S. District
Judge Manuel Real, who found that Visciotti's trial counsel, Roger J.
Agajanian, provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately
investigate or present mitigating evidence that could have led to a
life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit ruling was unanimous, with U.S. Circuit Judge
Harry Pregerson, one of the three judges, contending that Agajanian's
performance was so bad that the guilty verdict should also have been
overturned.</TE>
<TE>   Visciotti was convicted in 1983 of fatally shooting Timothy
Dykstra and seriously wounding Michael Wolberg in a robbery that
netted $120. Visciotti and co-defendant Brian L. Hefner left the two
men in Santiago Canyon southeast of Orange after Visciotti shot them
with a gun Hefner provided, according to trial testimony. Wolberg,
who lost sight in his left eye, was the key witness against Hefner
and Visciotti in separate trials. Hefner received a life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County prosecutors sought the death sentence against
Visciotti, citing the fact that he was the triggerman, several years
older than Hefner and had a criminal record, including having served
three years in prison after pleading guilty to stabbing a man in
1978.</TE>
<TE>   When he sentenced Visciotti to death in October 1983, Orange
County Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald said, "It's my
greatest hope, sir, that you will actually be executed, and if it
would happen soon, I would enjoy that."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Pregerson, joined by Judges A. Wallace Tashima and
Marsha S. Berzon, described several bad moves by Agajanian at the
penalty phase that warranted overturning the death sentence. The
judges said Agajanian, among other things, failed to investigate and
discover mitigating evidence, gave a rambling closing argument that
undercut his client's case, and failed to tell the jury about
psychological and physical abuse Visciotti suffered as a child.</TE>
<TE>   Visciotti had a troubled upbringing in a violent family, started
using drugs at age 8, and was in and out of Juvenile Court.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit said Agajanian did not heed the advice of two
court-appointed psychiatrists that Visciotti should get further
psychological testing because his numerous head injuries might have
caused brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   Agajanian told one of the doctors that he was "not willing to take
the time for or to pay for" additional investigation, even though
Agajanian later said he thought a court would find that Visciotti
could not pay for counsel or expert witnesses and therefore could get
them at government expense.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Pregerson wrote, Agajanian inaccurately portrayed
"Visciotti as the one 'bad seed' in his family" rather than as a
victim of serious abuse. "Perhaps most importantly," the judge said,
Agajanian's closing argument gave the jurors "no reason not to impose
the death penalty."</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit panel concluded: "There is a reasonable
probability that the omitted evidence would have changed the [jury's]
conclusion that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the
mitigating circumstances and hence, the sentence imposed."</TE>
<TE>   In its ruling Wednesday, the 9th Circuit disagreed with two
previous decisions of the California Supreme Court, which had upheld
the death sentence. In 1996, the state high court acknowledged
"multiple failings" by Agajanian but said that even if the lawyer had
presented additional mitigating evidence, "it is not probable" there
would have been a different result.</TE>
<TE>   Two state Supreme Court justices, Stanley Mosk and Janice Rogers
Brown, issued dissents at the time that used even stronger language
than the 9th Circuit did Wednesday. Agajanian's closing argument at
the penalty phase was "worthless," Mosk wrote. Brown said,
"Agajanian's abysmal across-the-board performance rendered the
penalty phase of the trial a complete and utter farce."</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit said the California Supreme Court majority had
been flatly incorrect in the standard it applied for what a defendant
had to show to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Under a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Strickland vs.
Washington, to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of
counsel, an inmate must demonstrate that his trial lawyer's
performance was well below professional norms and that there was a
"reasonable probability" that the deficient performance prejudiced
the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "The California Supreme Court's decision was 'contrary to' Supreme
Court law because it mischaracterized Strickland's prejudice
standard," Pregerson wrote. "Instead of evaluating whether there was
a reasonable probability that, absent Agajanian's deficient
performance, the result of the proceedings would have been different,
the California Supreme Court evaluated whether a more favorable
result was probable absent Agajanian's deficient performance."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy federal public defender Statia Peakheart said she and her
co-counsel, William H. Forman, were "extremely happy for Mr.
Visciotti. His trial lawyer did not represent him to any sort of
proper standard."</TE>
<TE>   Gary W. Schons, senior assistant attorney general, said, "We are
disappointed by the outcome." He said "there is a strong likelihood"
that the state will ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case with a
larger panel of judges.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Agajanian said he did not think his performance was
constitutionally deficient. But he added that as he does not believe
in the death penalty, he was happy for Visciotti. After the Visciotti
case, Agajanian was suspended three times from the State Bar of
California, and in 1994 voluntarily resigned from the bar, according
to bar spokesman Marlon Villa. Agajanian was readmitted last year.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit by Activists, Fishermen Seeks More Klamath Water
for Salmon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ratcheting up tensions in the Klamath River basin, fishermen and
environmentalists Wednesday sought a federal court order to provide
imperiled salmon with more water this spring than granted by the Bush
administration.</LD>
<LD>   Farmers reacted with anger, some fearing a repeat of last year's
water shortage that forced some into bankruptcy and triggered a
nationwide debate about whether farmers or endangered fish deserved
scarce water.</LD>
<LD>   The environmentalists asked a federal judge to issue a temporary
restraining order that would limit water now flowing to farmers if
river levels cannot be boosted higher to help young coho salmon.
Their request is coupled with a lawsuit challenging federal
allotments of water in the basin, where agriculture suffered a record
drought last summer.</LD>
<TE>   By appealing to the courts, fishermen and environmentalists may
trigger a battle over the U.S. Endangered Species Act, which has
riled farmers and ranchers throughout the West by its protection of
rare species, sometimes at agriculture's expense.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Oakland, claims that
the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation violated the act by failing to consult
fully with the National Marine Fisheries Service before starting to
channel water to Klamath Basin farm fields in late March.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney representing farmers criticized the suit by the
Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen and seven environmental groups,
calling it a "horrible distraction" to ongoing efforts to balance
water needs in the Klamath basin, which straddles the
Oregon-California border.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to see these people attacked again," said Paul Simmons,
lawyer for the Klamath Water Users' Assn., representing farmers
served by the Bureau of Reclamation irrigation project.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys filing the suit say they do not anticipate that a judge
will shut off farmers' irrigation water entirely, even if the
plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order is granted.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need here is a balanced allocation of the water to meet
the minimum needs of the fish. We're not talking about shutting off
the water," said Todd True, a lawyer for the Earthjustice Legal
Defense Fund, which is representing the fishermen and environmental
groups.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was filed as federal officials, biologists and
attorneys duel over how to divide water among farmers, fish and
Native American tribes in the basin.</TE>
<TE>   Worrying those seeking peace in the basin, early projections of
plentiful water this year have proved overly optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   The National Resources Conservation Service forecast in January
that 445,000 acre-feet of water would enter Upper Klamath Lake from
April through December, which would be 114% of a normal water year.</TE>
<TE>   But an April 17 revision predicted a drier year, with 375,000
acre-feet of water entering the basin, or 73% of normal. That would
still amount to far more water than was available during last year's
record drought.</TE>
<TE>   No final decisions have been reached on water allocations for this
year, even though Interior Secretary Gale Norton and Agriculture
Secretary Ann Veneman provided some early relief when they personally
opened the Klamath irrigation head gates late last month while
farmers cheered.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit filed by the fishermen's federation challenges the
legality of opening those head gates during April and May, saying the
required environmental reviews are still unfinished.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs argue that the springtime diversion of river water
to farm fields comes at a key time in salmon development, as young
fish hatch and year-old salmon start swimming toward the sea. They
say the imperiled fish need more water to survive.</TE>
<TE>   High-ranking federal officials huddled in Sacramento on Tuesday,
discussing the pending opinion from the National Marine Fisheries
Service on how a 10-year irrigation plan for the basin will affect
coho salmon in the lower Klamath River.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government listed the coho as threatened under the
Endangered Species Act in 1997, which means the fisheries service is
legally required to ensure that diverting water for farmers will not
force the fish toward extinction.</TE>

<HD>State Prison System $277 Million in the Red</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The California Department of Corrections has overspent its budget by
$277 million, adding to Gov. Gray Davis' deficit woes and prompting a
state Senate subcommittee Wednesday to vote down the governor's
proposal for a new $500 million-plus prison.</LD>
<LD>   Corrections Director Edward S. Alameida has said in past hearings
that the department is working on ways of resolving cost overruns,
but brushed aside inquiries after Wednesday's session, telling
reporters that he was taking up the issue internally with the Davis
administration and cutting off questions by saying: ''Gentlemen, I
have to take lunch.''</LD>
<LD>   Analysts attributed much of the overrun to personnel costs. If
that is the case, the problem may only get worse in light of the new
labor pact negotiated by the Davis administration and the California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn., one of the governor's biggest
campaign contributors.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement, signed by Davis in January, will cost the state
more than $500 million and possibly as much as $1 billion a year by
2006, when it takes full effect, according to legislative analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Alameida did not provide the senators with the department's
analysis of the labor agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Corrections, which is supposed to operate on a
$4.8-billion annual budget, has had deficits before: $52 million in
the 2000-01 fiscal year and $106 million in 1998-99.</TE>
<TE>   But the $277-million overrun is by far the largest within the
department and comes as Davis and legislators grapple with a 2002-03
budget shortfall now projected at about $20 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "They've never been challenged," state Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los
Angeles) said of corrections officials.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't care whether we appropriate $4 billion," he said.
"They know they're going to come to the trough and get an automatic
approval for whatever dollar amount they need. It's like automatic
pilot. It is horrible."</TE>
<TE>   Polanco, chairman of the budget subcommittee that oversees the
prison system, told Alameida that approving the new prison might add
to future overruns. "All we're going to do is build on the problem
you have" by authorizing what would be the state's 34th prison, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The cost-overrun numbers come as the state prison population
declines, to 156,000 inmates from a high of 162,000.</TE>
<TE>   Department officials say they need the new prison because the
number of maximum-security prisoners is rising and about 9,000
high-security inmates are kept in cells and bunks meant for
lower-security prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   A decision to block the new prison would require a vote of the
full Legislature. It would save a relative pittance, about $1.4
million requested for planning in the coming year.</TE>
<TE>   But to finance construction, the state would have to sell $311
million worth of bonds already approved by the Legislature, to be
paid off over 20 years, and would spend $100 million a year to
operate the facility once it opened in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco and state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) also rejected Davis'
plan to shut five private prisons housing about 1,400 low-security
inmates.</TE>
<TE>   The department estimates that the move would save the state $2.8
million. However, the nonprofit California Taxpayers Assn. said a
decision to close the private prisons could end up costing the state
$16 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the higher cost, according to the organization, is
that inmates transferred back to state prisons would end up serving
longer sentences, in part because they would not accumulate "good
time" by participating in educational and job programs. State prisons
have waiting lists for such programs, and there would be no openings
for 90% of the inmates now housed in private prisons, the taxpayers'
group said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question it alarms me," Sen. Dunn said of the
$277-million deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, we have not had some unexpected spike in inmate
population. We have not had any unexpected spike in expenses.... Why
we now find ourselves in this deficit is shocking."</TE>
<TE>   Dunn left open the possibility that he may change his mind about
the new prison at Delano and the private prisons later this summer as
the scope of California's budget problem becomes more clear.</TE>
<TE>   Alameida suggested after the hearing that he wasn't responsible
for the cost overruns, saying he has been director for only five
months. Davis appointed Alameida, a career corrections official, in
September.</TE>
<TE>   The nonpartisan legislative analyst's office attributes the cost
overrun to "ongoing structural problems with the department's
budget."</TE>
<TE>   The analyst said a large number of vacancies within the department
and heavy use of overtime and sick leave by prison employees strain
the department's budget, as do pay hikes negotiated in past years
that have not been fully funded by the governor and Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   The department has been accused in state audits of mismanaging its
sick leave and overtime policies.</TE>
<TE>   Alameida has submitted a document to the state Department of
Finance justifying the $277-million overrun and seeking payment.</TE>
<TE>   Finance spokesman Sandy Harrison said department officials are
"analyzing it to determine if it is justified and appropriate," and
will address the issue next month when Davis releases his revised
budget proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Green of the state Youth and Adult Correctional Agency said
the deficit is part of an "ongoing problem" that dates back to the
early 1990s. Each year, he said, the department turns to the
Legislature for additional money.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have a 'deficiency bill,' as we do every year," Green
said, referring to the particular type of legislation that
departments seek when they overspend their budgets.</TE>

<HD>Marchers Protest Armenian Genocide</HD>
<DH>Anniversary: About 20,000 call on Turks to admit guilt in
the deaths of 1.5 million beginning in 1915.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 20,000 marchers took to the streets of Hollywood's Little
Armenia on Wednesday to call on Turkey to acknowledge its historical
role in the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians that began
in 1915.</LD>
<LD>   The most vocal in the procession were, primarily, high school
students in black T-shirts who shouted, "1915, never again!"</LD>
<LD>   Maggie Melikyan, a 17-year-old senior at North Hollywood High
School, typified the attitude of many young people as she watched
marchers pass the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue
under threatening skies.</LD>
<TE>   The Armenian genocide "is something that you feel in your heart,
that you feel in your soul," said Melikyan, who recounted stories
that a surviving relative told of the killings carried out by the
Ottoman Turkish authorities during World War I and shortly afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely alive for me," Melikyan said.</TE>
<TE>   The march was one of several events staged in Southern California
on Wednesday to mark Armenian Genocide Day.</TE>
<TE>   April 24 is the date that Armenian historians and activists say
the mass slaughter began.</TE>
<TE>   Such observances are particularly meaningful in Greater Los
Angeles, where more than half a million people of Armenian descent
live. It is the largest enclave of Armenians anywhere outside their
traditional homelands in Turkey and the nation of Armenia.</TE>
<TE>   In Montebello, hundreds gathered at the Armenian Genocide Martyrs
Monument to rally and call on Turkey to accept responsibility for the
victims' deaths and the displacement of 500,000 people from their
homes in Turkish lands.</TE>
<TE>   Later, protesters picketed the mid-Wilshire offices of the Turkish
consul general.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to the Turkish Consulate went unanswered. Officials of the
Turkish republic, which succeeded the Ottoman Empire in 1923, have
long denied that the Turks committed genocide.</TE>
<TE>   That mattered little to the marchers in Little Armenia, who
carried signs that read, "Turkey guilty of genocide," "We condemn
terrorism and genocide" and "Armenians united forever."</TE>
<TE>   They walked for nearly two miles, partially closing Sunset and
Hollywood boulevards and Normandie and Western avenues.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Little Armenia businesses were closed to mark the day. At
a rally after the march, speakers told the crowd, in Armenian and
English, never to forget the genocide.</TE>
<TE>   "Our land was taken from us," said Archbishop Vatche Hovsepyan of
the Armenian Apostolic Church. "We were massacred on our own land."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Eric Garcetti, who represents Little
Armenia, added that April 24 stands as "one of the [most] horrible
days in human history."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd cheered loudly when a representative of Gov. Gray Davis
said the state's chief executive had recognized Wednesday as a day of
remembrance throughout California for the Armenian genocide.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be outdone by Democrats, ranking Republicans also issued
statements of solidarity with Armenians. President Bush and Bill
Simon Jr., the GOP nominee for governor who faces Davis in the
November election, said the genocide should never be forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   Bush in his message called on Turkey to lift its blockades and
normalize relations with Armenia.</TE>
<TE>   In his statement, Simon said, "We are grateful for the countless
ways in which Armenian Americans continue to enrich California's
science, culture, commerce and, indeed, all aspects of our life."</TE>

<CX>   Armenian tragedy-A story in the California section April 25
incorrectly described President Bush's condemnation of the mass killings
of Armenians by the Ottoman Turks in 1915. Bush denounced the killings as
a "massacre" and as an "appalling tragedy of the 20th century," but did
not use the word "genocide" to describe the killings.</CX>

<HD>Former CHP Officer's Trial in Cocaine Theft Begins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former California Highway Patrol officer went on trial in federal
court Wednesday, charged with taking part in the theft of nearly 650
pounds of cocaine from an evidence locker at the state Bureau of
Narcotic Enforcement office in Riverside.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors say George Michael Ruelas, 43, was one of three rogue
law enforcement officers who staged a fake burglary while the
bureau's office was closed over the July 4, 1997, holiday weekend.</LD>
<LD>   It remains the largest drug theft from any law enforcement agency
in California, investigators say.</LD>
<TE>   The mastermind was Ruelas' half brother, Richard Wayne Parker, 47,
a veteran state narcotics agent assigned to the Riverside office.
Convicted in 1999, he is serving a life prison term.</TE>
<TE>   Also taking part was Ruelas' former CHP partner, Michael Wilcox,
42, of Fresno. He pleaded guilty in the case and is expected to be
the government's star witness against Ruelas.</TE>
<TE>   "These were smart, savvy, sophisticated law enforcement officers
who thought they were committing the perfect crime," Assistant U.S.
Atty. Lisabeth A. Rhodes said in opening remarks to the Los Angeles
federal court jury.</TE>
<TE>   Ruelas' lawyer, Joel Levine, said his client "emphatically" denies
taking part in the break-in or in several smaller drug thefts blamed
on the three men.</TE>
<TE>   Levine said Ruelas was driving to Tucson on the day of the theft.
He said the defense will produce a dated receipt from an Arizona gas
station to support Ruelas' alibi.</TE>
<TE>   The defense attorney accused Wilcox, who has yet to be sentenced,
of lying to save his own skin. He also said the FBI targeted Ruelas
because he was a loyal "cheerleader" for his half brother, regularly
attending his 1999 trial in a show of support.</TE>
<TE>   Ruelas, who is a charged with conspiracy and possession of cocaine
for sale, faces a possible life prison term if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   The case against the three former officers and close friends began
taking shape July 2, 1998, when FBI agents on a routine stakeout
followed a suspected drug dealer from Manhattan Beach to Pasadena,
where she handed over an envelope with $47,000 in cash to a stranger
in a pickup truck.</TE>
<TE>   The stranger turned out to be Parker. His truck was registered to
the Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement. After arresting him, FBI agents
recovered $599,000 in cash along with drug transaction ledgers at his
San Juan Capistrano home.</TE>
<TE>   A month after Parker's conviction, federal agents arrested Wilcox
in Fresno on charges of structuring 13 cash deposits, each just under
$10,000, to skirt bank reporting requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Once in custody, Wilcox confessed to taking part in the Riverside
cocaine theft and implicated Ruelas, according to an FBI affidavit.
He said he and Ruelas carried out the actual theft, using keys and
the access code provided by Parker. Because Parker would probably
come under scrutiny, he said it was decided that Parker should stay
away so he could prove he was elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Wilcox said, he drove back to Fresno with the cocaine
and hid it. Periodically over the next year, he said, Ruelas would
drive there, pick up several kilograms of cocaine and pay Wilcox his
share from the previous sale.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox agreed to arrange a meeting with Ruelas, wearing a
concealed recording device provided by the FBI. During that meeting,
prosecutors said, Ruelas coached Wilcox on what to say if questioned
by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, Ruelas was arrested.</TE>

<HD>Riders Hope to Keep Their Connections</HD>
<DH>Commuting: A day after a Metrolink crash that injured
hundreds, travelers wonder about friends and familiar faces on the
route.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON and TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Schroeder has forged some of his friendships in staggered
encounters of an hour or so a day, the time it usually takes him to
ride Metrolink 809 from his Riverside home to his job in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Among these friends are Ron and Edna, Jenny and Lulu, regulars who
sit in the same part of the train each morning and pass the time with
a newspaper or small talk.</LD>
<LD>   They were there Tuesday when a Burlington Northern Santa Fe
freight train ran a signal and plowed into their little world,
killing two people and injuring scores. Schroeder hasn't seen the
others since.</LD>
<TE>   "All I know is their first names," Schroeder, 37, said Wednesday
morning as he boarded a bus in Riverside, a substitute way to work
until the Metrolink line opened later in the day. "We had our little
group on the third car. A lot of those people were injured. I don't
know where they're at now and I'm worried about them."</TE>
<TE>   Train wrecks disrupt in myriad, and obvious, ways. People are
killed or injured. Survivors relive harrowing moments and
gut-wrenching scenes as their minds rewind to events they'd rather
forget.</TE>
<TE>   Less obvious are the disruptions to relationships, the shredding
of gossamer connections among people who share nothing more than
time, space and a commuter's bench.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a micro-community that we have in the last car,"
Barrie Britton, a bandage covering a gash across the bridge of his
nose, said as he boarded the bus Wednesday morning. "The one I'm
really worried about is Pat, the conductor. He's friends with all the
regulars. If he sees one of us running for the train in the morning,
he'll hold the train. He's just a super guy."</TE>
<TE>   As in other parts of society, the commuters aboard Train 809 tend
to sort themselves by common elements. Britton is part of a group of
eight Boeing workers who rely on 809 to get from Riverside to their
jobs in Anaheim. Another group heads off on a shuttle from the
Anaheim Canyon station to Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the relationships extend beyond the commute. Joe Lee, 56,
joined a Bible study group that meets on the upper level of Train
809's middle car.</TE>
<TE>   "They are my train friends," he said Wednesday afternoon as he
waited in Anaheim for his train home to Moreno Valley. "You don't see
them away from here, but you're anxious to see them when you're
here.... You know about peoples' lives, but you only see them on the
train. Through talking with them you find out we have lots in
common."</TE>
<TE>   One group of about 15 regulars has knit together an uncommon
fraternity aboard Metrolink, including Train 809. Wednesday evening,
several of them were aboard Train 806 for the return trip from Irvine
to Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   There are three Bobs, two Mikes and two others just known as "very
loud people." Over six years they've shared birthdays and
retirements, job changes and personal crises while following one
cardinal rule:</TE>
<TE>   "We know that what is said on the train stays on the train," said
Diane Martinez , who works in patient financial services at UCI
Medical Center in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell each other our problems," Bob Carlos said. "You tell them
things you can't tell your own families."</TE>
<TE>   Four members of the group were injured in Tuesday's crash. None of
those were commuting Wednesday, but they were in their friends'
thoughts. Jody broke a rib. Cindy hurt her back. Richard had a
concussion and Robin was knocked unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   Those were all the details the group had--and all they needed to
know, other than that their friends would recover.</TE>
<TE>   No one in the group could remember how or why they came together.
They convene in the morning in the second car from the front, and in
the third car on the way home at night.</TE>
<TE>   For Sheila J. Fisher, the train is a mobile social club. Over the
last four years of commuting from Los Angeles to Santa Ana, she has
helped organize two Christmas parties and recently read from the
Torah during an on-board Seder.</TE>
<TE>   ''It takes seven of us to fill out a crossword puzzle,'' she said,
adding that by the time she gets off the train she has ''left behind
all of the woes of the day.''</TE>
<TE>   Commuter conversations between Leslie Francisco, 47, of Riverside
and Linda Pittman, 44, of Moreno Valley evolved over the years into a
deeper friendship than most of those struck up on the rails. Both
women missed Tuesday's wreck. Francisco took the day off; Pittman now
takes another train.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't on the train, but I knew people on it and feel like I
went through it all," Francisco said Wednesday afternoon as she
waited to board her train at Anaheim Canyon station.</TE>
<TE>   The evening after the wreck, the two friends reached out to each
other.</TE>
<TE>   "She called yesterday to see if I was OK," Francisco said. "We
talk about our families, we care for each other, e-mail each other.
We talk about work, our husbands."</TE>
<TE>   For most, though, the connections are more tenuous. Schroeder, for
instance, worried Wednesday about familiar faces but didn't know the
people well enough to figure out how to reach them.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Turner, 47, wasn't in the commuter neighborhood Tuesday. He
took the day off to play golf, and once he got home saw the events
unfold on television, an unsettling window into a moment that on a
regular day would have swept him up.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked to see so many people that I recognized," Turner
said. "I kept seeing person after person being interviewed. A lot of
them were hurt.... It's almost like a family, a little community."</TE>
<TE>   And as in most communities, some members are closer than others.</TE>
<TE>   "I only take the train in twice a week, so I feel like a bit of an
outsider," Turner said when he showed up for his Wednesday trip--he
commutes twice a week usually--but found few of the regulars were
around.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis McPherran, 45, of Redlands missed the wreck Tuesday because
he took a different train. On Wednesday, when he boarded a bus in
Riverside, he saw few familiar faces.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually there are about 200 people who board the train, and there
were only about 20 who got on my bus," McPherran said as he got off
the bus in Irvine after an unusually long three-hour commute.</TE>
<TE>   The mood on the bus was subdued, McPherran said. Yet commuters
were linked again by common purpose--getting to work--and by their
proximity to the crash.</TE>
<TE>   So some did what they usually do: They talked about it, and about
their surprise that it happened at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Very seldom is anyone on a Metrolink hurt," McPherran said.
"Usually it's people on the tracks or in a car that are hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Barrett was aboard Tuesday, part of the Cal State Fullerton
group. He had been hurt, though not badly. He awoke Wednesday sore
and stiff but ready for work--yet not ready to board a bus or train.</TE>
<TE>   So he dallied over breakfast with his family, then joined the
majority and hit the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like this driving business," he said by cell phone
Wednesday morning from the 91 Freeway. "I'll be back on the train
tomorrow. You've got to get back on."</TE>
<TE>   Like many of those who form Train 809's ephemeral community of
commuters, Barrett wasn't sure Wednesday what had become of familiar
faces from Cal State Fullerton. Or the crew from Boeing--Britton and
his pals--with whom Barrett once had dinner when their afternoon
train was canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Or the carpenter who boards every morning with a bucket of tools.
Barrett doesn't know his name, but last he knew the carpenter was
reading Carl Sagan's "Cosmos."</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be back there tomorrow," Barrett said as he drove
alone, "and make sure he's not hurt."</TE>

<HD>Cardinals Call for Policy to Defrock Abusive Priests</HD>
<DH>Religion: The proposed rules on offenders are stricter than older
guidelines but stop short of 'zero tolerance.'</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY
</DL>
<LD>Emboldened by Pope John Paul II and stung by an unprecedented
sexual abuse scandal at home, U.S. Roman Catholic cardinals called
Wednesday for steps making it easier to defrock priests guilty of sexual
abuse. But they stopped short of a "zero-tolerance" dismissal policy.</LD>
<LD>   Wrapping up two days of extraordinary sessions with the pope and
senior Vatican cardinals, the U.S. delegation said it had set the stage
for a comprehensive plan to wrest the American church from its most
serious moral and legal crisis in modern times.</LD>
<LD>   Their final communique was short on specifics. It called for new
procedures to speed the dismissal of any priest "who has become notorious
and is guilty of the serial, predatory sexual abuse of minors," as well
as first-time offenders deemed to be incorrigible. It recommended
safeguards to screen out problem candidates from seminaries.</LD>
<TE>   But it made no mention of other steps many of the cardinals had said
they wanted: a "one-strike" rule for all future sex offenders, mandatory
reporting of all abuse cases to law enforcement agencies, and greater
involvement of lay Catholics in overseeing the church's treatment of
offenders. Nor did it spell out how church canon law should be changed to
make it easier to defrock priests while protecting their right to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the high-powered meetings are likely to be remembered as a
defining moment, when an issue that the Vatican once viewed as an
"American problem" irreversibly became its own. The meetings also
increased pressure on American bishops to formally adopt a plan that will
convince Catholics that they can entrust the church with their children.</TE>
<TE>   Even with tougher standards of accountability and openness on sexual
abuse, the cardinals said, it might take years for the church to regain
its credibility. The scandal, they conceded, has not only damaged victims
and cost millions of dollars in settlements, but it has also weakened the
church's moral voice.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the church were disappointed by the communique but not
surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, there has been, and there remains, a huge gap between
what bishops say and what bishops do," said Barbara Blaine of Chicago,
founder of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests. "Their
promises sound good, but their performance is lacking."</TE>
<TE>   Fundamental decisions lie ahead for the church. Chief among them is
how to deal with priests who abused minors many years ago but have since
appeared to be leading successful and healthy ministries. There is likely
to be tension between bishops who believe in the Christian virtue of
repentance and forgiveness, and an outraged public that seems in no mood
to forgive and forget.</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving Rome, the Vatican and U.S. cardinals dispatched a
letter to the priests of America voicing "regret that episcopal oversight
has not been able to preserve the church from this scandal."</TE>
<TE>   They called on bishops to set aside a day of prayer and penance
throughout the United States "to implore reconciliation" between sinners
and abused members of their flock.</TE>
<TE>   In their communique, the cardinals dismissed the idea, put forward by
some Catholics, that a married priesthood would reduce pedophilia by
clerics. The cardinals declared that "a link between celibacy and
pedophilia cannot be scientifically maintained," and they reaffirmed the
requirement that priests lead celibate lives.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters, the cardinals sounded confident that the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops would approve a comprehensive plan against
sex abuse when its members meet in Dallas in June. They said the pope's
exhortations and the chastising of bishops by an outraged public would
spur the bishops to approve the still-unwritten plan.</TE>
<TE>   "This meeting was neither the end nor the beginning of a response to
the sex abuse crisis," said Father Thomas J. Reese, New York-based editor
of the Jesuit magazine America. "We are in neither the first inning nor
the last."</TE>
<TE>   American bishops have been grappling with the sexual abuse issue for
more than a decade. Indeed, some of the proposals outlined here Wednesday
echoed similar initiatives advanced in 1993 but ignored in many dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a report to the bishops conference in 1994 said the best
way for the church to deal with accusations of child molestation by
clergy was in "a spirit of openness, justice and compassion." It said
sexual abuse policies should "clearly state a willingness to cooperate
with government authorities to the extent possible."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, dozens of American priests and a bishop have resigned or
been fired because of sex abuse allegations.</TE>
<TE>   There have also been calls for the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law
of Boston, where the scandal began in January after the Boston Globe
disclosed that his archdiocese had moved from parish to parish a
pedophile priest accused of molesting as many as 130 boys over three
decades.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals from the cardinals would for the first time allow some
sex abusers to be removed from the priesthood. Dismissal would be swift
for any priest "who has become notorious." In the case of a less serious
offender, a bishop could demand dismissal if, after a review of the case,
he considered the priest a continuing threat to the young--a step that is
now difficult to take under canon law.</TE>
<TE>   "That's clearly a ratcheting up," Reese said. "If we look at the
original guidelines, the ones they're proposing now are stricter. They're
talking about lay involvement [in overseeing cases]. They're talking
about dismissal from the priesthood . . . and they're talking about this
being binding [on bishops] across the board."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Francis George of Chicago said the Polish pope had previously
been wary of dismissing priests "because he lived, as he told us again
and again, in a communist state where administrative law was misused
against human rights."</TE>
<TE>   But the pope's remarks to the cardinals Tuesday marked a shift.
"People need to know that there is no place in the priesthood and
religious life for those who would harm the young," John Paul said,
adding that the abuse of minors was both a civil crime and "an appalling
sin."</TE>
<TE>   The pope's views were clearly on the cardinals' minds. "Once you
listen to the holy father, and once the holy father says there is no
place in priestly ministries for someone who harms children or young
people, then you know you have to work from there," Cardinal Theodore
McCarrick of Washington said.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, president of the U.S. bishops conference,
acknowledged that the final statement was "skeletal." But he said most
U.S. bishops are already putting many of the proposals into practice in
their own dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   But controversy remained over how to deal with old cases of sexual
abuse involving priests who may have only one incident of abuse on their
record.</TE>
<TE>   "I think anyone who in the future would do something like this to a
child or a youngster, that's it," McCarrick said, wagging his finger for
emphasis. But he said a 30-year-old isolated case might be another thing.
"I've got to pray about that one, and think about that one more, and
listen to the laypeople more."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether an abusive priest who has been rehabilitated could
continue his ministry, Gregory said: "Personally, I'd say no. However,
when we meet in June, that will be a hotly debated question. . . . Some
bishops might want to seek the counsel of a wise group of laypeople
before making that decision."</TE>
<TE>   At the Vatican's insistence, the tougher procedures would allow
accused offenders to appeal any bishop's decision to an ecclesiastical
court. But the appeal process, which can drag on for years, would be
accelerated, church officials said.</TE>
<TE>   American bishops thought they had resolved the clerical sex abuse
problem when they issued their 1993 guidelines. But those were
nonbinding, and some bishops did not follow them. Among those bishops was
Law, who is facing increasing calls from parishioners in Boston--and
senior clerics elsewhere--for his resignation as archbishop.</TE>
<TE>   A knowledgeable source told The Times that a message indicating that
many senior American clerics want Law to resign was privately delivered
to members of the pope's inner circle of advisors this week.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory said the issue was not discussed during the meetings of the
last two days and that the situation rests in the hands of the pope.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether John Paul supports the Boston cardinal, papal spokesman
Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Wednesday night: "I cannot say that. I lack
information on that point."</TE>
<TE>   Several cardinals have publicly distanced themselves from statements
in The Times from a cardinal and a bishop, who asked to remain anonymous,
about the call for Law to resign.</TE>
<TE>   "There was this great rumor that came out of the West that said there
was this cabal, there was a bunch of cardinals all set to ask for his
resignation," McCarrick said. "I think that was made out of whole cloth.
None of the cardinals I spoke to--and I spoke to them all--had anything
other than amazement about that story. So I don't think that was true."</TE>
<TE>   The cardinals' communique capped one of the most visible encounters
ever between the Vatican hierarchy and leaders of the American church.
Not since 1989 had so many senior American clerics converged on the
Vatican to focus on a problem back home.</TE>
<TE>   After ignoring the sex scandals for nearly four months, the Vatican
summoned the American cardinals for what it hoped would be a low-profile
"consultation." The Americans, eager to shore up their battered
reputations at home, called the two-day meeting a "summit" and gave
frequent briefings to the news media.</TE>
<TE>   TV cameras recorded their movements as they shuttled in minivans
between the Vatican-run seminary where most of them were lodged and the
Apostolic Palace, where they held their private meetings. The cardinals
wore business-like black cassocks and crimson skullcaps known as
zucchettos.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul did not attend their meetings. He addressed them in his
library Tuesday and had them over Wednesday for lunch. Otherwise, he went
about his usual business, including a general audience at which he
appealed for an end to the long standoff between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian gunmen at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity.</TE>

<HD>Faith in the City and in the Future</HD>
<DH>Despite setbacks, longtime developer of downtown projects hopes he
will see his dream of a vibrant Los Angeles become reality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He works amid ghosts. Downtown ghosts. Buildings and streets that
once held a city together. For two decades he has dedicated himself to
bringing the downtown ghosts back to life.</LD>
<LD>   Others have written volumes about how Los Angeles lacks a core. But
this shy, driven man felt the heart of the city was always there, just
waiting to be revealed.</LD>
<LD>   He saw it in the decayed iron lattice of the Bradbury Building, sensed
it at the dilapidated Union Station train depot and felt its pull from
the shopworn Grand Central Market.</LD>
<TE>   Ira Yellin moved his work from Beverly Hills to be among these
buildings. He restored them, helped make them whole again, and then, ever
the dreamer, he asked the rest of the city to embrace his vision.</TE>
<TE>   It has happened slowly. Too slowly, some complain, and at too great a
cost in public money. But years after he first arrived there, downtown
stirs.</TE>
<TE>   Every day, the 61-year-old Yellin reminds himself how far downtown has
come. And every day, as he fights through anxiety and incessant fatigue,
he is reminded of life's uncertainties--that he might not be able to see
his vision through.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more than a little ironic. It feels like I'm hitting my stride .
. ."</TE>
<TE>   His voice trails. A moment later, he coughs.</TE>
<TE>   He is not widely known. His trademark buildings are relatively small
in scale, particularly compared with the skyscrapers many hoped would
revitalize a listless downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Yellin--Jewish community leader, champion of culture, political
patron--was the first big-shot Westside developer, a builder of shopping
malls and business parks, to plant enduring roots in the tattered blocks
east of Bunker Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles owes him a debt of gratitude," says California State
Librarian Kevin Starr, who calls Yellin "an urban pioneer." Yellin is
"unique for what he wants for the city, and what he has helped build. . .
. For a while, his was a voice in the wilderness."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years back, when few entrepreneurs wanted anything to do with
the city's historic core, Yellin began buying landmark buildings: the
Bradbury, the Million Dollar Theater, the old Metropolitan Water District
headquarters. They were wounded, all crumbled brick and loose foundations
and shadows.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin set about to change things. He turned old offices into
apartments. He tore at walls that weren't original, restored murals,
gilded interiors with brick and oak and iron. Light came in. The ghosts
began breathing.</TE>
<TE>   The rough gem among them was the World War I-vintage Grand Central
Market, on Broadway at the base of Bunker Hill. Since his father took him
for visits in childhood, he's coveted the block-long smorgasbord of
immigrant-run kiosks.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a love affair," says Yellin. "With a building."</TE>
<TE>   Yellin--a short urbane man who walks with shoulders back and jaw
jutting--is ambling through the market.</TE>
<TE>   Although he favors designer suits and can command a boardroom, he
seems more comfortable here--rubbing shoulders with tattooed homeboys,
elderly women from Chinatown and financial district yuppies.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's because the Grand Central is the synthesis of his
vision--a place unusual for Los Angeles, a place binding the city's
multitudes.</TE>
<TE>   "You see the colors, smell the smells . . . I mean look, look at
that," he says, pointing at bins full of red beans, dried white fish and
green peppers. "You can just stand here and almost taste how special this
place is."</TE>
<TE>   But where Yellin sees human and cultural fusion, some others see the
government bankrolling another wealthy developer.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, two public agencies--the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment
Agency and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority--teamed up to
provide a $44-million bond package to help make Yellin's dream real. The
deal allowed him to restore not only the Grand Central Market, but also
the adjoining theater and old water district offices.</TE>
<TE>   For a variety of reasons--from the lingering effects of the early
1990s recession to the dearth of nearby development to the overly
optimistic projections of traffic that could be generated from a nearby
subway stop--the deal has been a financial disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Rents have not met expectations. Some vendors have left. Yellin has
never found a full-time tenant for the Million Dollar Theater, which now
stands vacant.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, the CRA and MTA were forced to bail the developer out
by restructuring the deal to lessen his payments. This March, with Yellin
behind on his payments and the MTA having spent more than $4 million to
help close the shortfall, the agencies chose to refinance.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the subject brings groans and grim faces from MTA officials,
who say they'll never form such a partnership again.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin and his supporters argue that the deal was a good one for the
city, that the market has been a catalyst for construction and planning
for the rest of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is one of the city's best places, it should be cherished,
propped up," says former Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Feuer. "If Ira
didn't show the beauty that could be uncovered, the activity that we are
seeing in that area, it wouldn't have happened."</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago saw the groundbreaking of an avant-garde, $171-million
Caltrans building that Yellin's firm, Urban Partners, is developing next
to City Hall. Planners envision a structure swaddled in a thin,
perforated sheet of flowing steel, complemented by a civic
plaza--designed to be the long-discussed central square the city has
lacked.</TE>
<TE>   In September comes the opening of the towering Cathedral of Our Lady
of the Angels, expected to be one of the city's cultural linchpins.
Yellin, the son of an Orthodox rabbi, ran the international design
competition to pick its architect.</TE>
<TE>   Couple these with other Yellin projects--including a massive apartment
complex alongside a budding light-rail line at Del Mar Boulevard in
Pasadena--and it would be easy to think that, for Yellin, these are the
best of times.</TE>
<TE>   They would be, if his body hadn't recently gone haywire.</TE>
<TE>   For Yellin, it is another long day on the job --stretching now into
night.</TE>
<TE>   He is poring over details of one of his projects with a city
commission on public art. Few prominent developers, those who have worked
with him say, are such careful watchdogs of the finer details as Yellin.</TE>
<TE>   In this meeting, he is riveted by the plans for a single elevator
shaft.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to do anything that is going to interfere with the light
and the air," he says. Nothing "corny or pedestrian."</TE>
<TE>   Looking at a slide show, he worries about who will design a fence. Oh,
I love this artist, he gushes, looking at the photo of a metallic canopy.
He announces that the work is an example of a creative mind in full
bloom. When the artist is picked, Yellin's favorite gets the nod.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in his black BMW on the way to his home in Santa Monica Canyon,
he is fatigued and reflective.</TE>
<TE>   In August, after Yellin complained about a persistent cough, his
doctor sent X-rays to a specialist. The doctor rushed to call Yellin
back.</TE>
<TE>   Ira, he said, it doesn't look good.</TE>
<TE>   Lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   It made no sense. He'd guarded his body all his life, he'd eaten well,
worked out fanatically, never smoked. His whole being--from his gleaming
blue-gray eyes, to his boyish face, to his taut and slender body--spoke
of health. Where was the fairness?</TE>
<TE>   He attacked the disease in his meticulous, optimistic way. First, he
gave friends the news straight. Don't worry, he told them, I can deal
with this. If something happens, my family is taken care of, the firm
poised to go on. He ended up asking most of them, "Are you OK?"</TE>
<TE>   Spiritual, if not devout, he studied a book about Job. He read every
medical text he could get his hands on. He raced though the autobiography
of cyclist Lance Armstrong, who chased away the cancer that had invaded
his brain, then won the Tour de France three times.</TE>
<TE>   Chemotherapy brought on bone-numbing fatigue, seemed to shrink him,
caused his thick, mahogany hair to fall out. Yellin simply shaved his
head and went about his days, full tilt.</TE>
<TE>   But the chemo failed. He now pins his hopes on an experimental drug, a
single pill, gulped down each morning with water.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the results seem positive. His tumors have shrunk or stopped
growing. There's no pain. His hair is growing, though it's gone mostly
gray. But the fatigue lingers, as does a lump on one of his bronchial
tubes--the cause of the coughing.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin holds on to the hope he can be another Armstrong. "What option
is there?" he asks. "Other than to keep pushing back?"</TE>
<TE>   Yellin's friends, and he is a man with many, are not surprised by his
determination. They note he still looks well. They remind themselves that
Ira Yellin almost always sees his vision through.</TE>
<TE>   In Van Nuys and near Venice, site of his father's congregation, Yellin
was raised to follow the Jewish principle of tikkun olam, repairing the
world through good works.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1965, spent a year at UC
Berkeley . . . and promptly joined the Marines. It was to prove to
himself that his ideals of public service weren't idle thoughts. And that
he was tough enough to do it.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1970s, he had not only made partner at a prestigious
Hollywood law firm, but had also helped lead a pro-bono practice focusing
on civil and environmental rights.</TE>
<TE>   When he made the leap to building, he became a patron of art,
befriended top designers and served on the boards of prominent museums.
He immersed himself in politics, epitomizing the Jewish Westsiders who
joined with African Americans to help keep Tom Bradley in office for five
terms.</TE>
<TE>   His Santa Monica Canyon home became more than a streamlined modern
showpiece and home for his wife, Adele, and two children. It was a
Westside gathering spot, "a haven," says Uri Herscher, president of the
Skirball Cultural Center, "a place with an open-door policy . . . where
strong, important ideas were discussed."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, a diverse cast of the informed and the influential
visited the Yellin home. From a black police chief to an Asian
businessman to architect Frank Gehry and politicos such as Walter Mondale
and Hillary Clinton, they were all welcome--for political fund-raisers,
cocktail parties, even for Passover Seders.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those who still frequent his home remark that they are struck
by the way he shuts the world out to focus on their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "In a real way, he is a rabbi . . . ," says Gary Greenebaum, director
of the American Jewish Committee and a rabbi, "a man who listens to the
stories of others."</TE>
<TE>   The story Yellin yearns to see finished is the downtown story.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be easy. "We bring them down here," says Yellin, speaking of
representatives from the grocery stores and restaurants he's courted for
years. "We show them around; they get scared. There's a lot of work to do
still."</TE>
<TE>   All around, that work continues, as more ghosts wait to be brought
back to life.</TE>
<TE>   The opening of the Caltrans building is scheduled for early 2004. A
few months later will be a ribbon cutting at the stately Los Angeles
County Hall of Justice, yet another building Yellin's firm is restoring.</TE>
<TE>   For most people, these dates aren't far off. For Ira Yellin they stand
out there, uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be part of this," he says. "I plan on being around for a
good long time."</TE>
<TE>   A moment later, he coughs.</TE>

<HD>Freight Engineer in Crash Ran 2 Lights, Officials Find</HD>
<DH>Railway: Federal investigators rule out mechanical failure as cause
of Placentia wreck.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A freight engineer who ran past two warning signals most likely
caused the head-on crash with a Metrolink commuter train that killed two
passengers and injured hundreds of others, according to preliminary
findings released Wednesday by federal investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board said they are
focusing on the freight operator because they have ruled out brake or
other mechanical failure, track problems and signal malfunctions.</LD>
<LD>   About two miles from the site of the collision in Placentia, a yellow
light on the rail line signaled to the engineer that he should slow to 30
mph. But NTSB investigators said the Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight
engineer appeared to ignore or miss the light. The train picked up speed
to about 48 mph.</LD>
<TE>   "He did not slow the train at all," said Marion C. Blakey, the NTSB
chairwoman. "He kept going full bore."</TE>
<TE>   A minute and a half later, the 67-car freight train was signaled by a
red rail light to stop, but the train was traveling too fast. The
engineer's efforts to apply the emergency brakes were not enough to
prevent the train from slamming into the Metrolink cars, which had
already stopped on the track. The freight was going about 20 mph upon
impact, throwing passengers and causing two Metrolink coaches to derail.</TE>
<TE>   Seconds later, the freight hit the double-decker passenger cars a
second time, carrying it a total of 337 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The freight engineer, Darrell Wells, and the conductor, Dean E.
Tacoronte, jumped from the train moments before the crash. Tacoronte's
mother-in-law, Betty Wood, said he remained hospitalized with head
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "[My daughter] told me Dean said he looked up, and he saw the train,"
Wood said.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Metrolink commuters suffered fractures, lacerations and back
injuries. Some pushed out windows to escape the train, while the more
seriously injured had to be pulled out by rescuers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that the Burlington Northern train should have
stopped," Blakey said. "The [Metrolink] train had the right of way."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they have found no indication of criminal wrongdoing
and said their investigation will take months to complete.</TE>
<TE>   Two men--Robert Kube, 59, of Moreno Valley and Lawrence Sorensen, 48,
of Riverside--died from blunt-trauma injuries sustained in the crash, and
162 people were treated at hospitals. A few remained hospitalized
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Blakey called the Placentia accident a worst-case scenario, adding:
"This kind of head-on collision is exactly what the NTSB has been
concerned about for years."</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the crash, Blakey said, the rail industry must consider
installing fully automated braking systems, which are used in the
Northeast. There, passenger and freight trains also share common tracks.</TE>
<TE>   The system operates without action by the engineer. It is triggered by
warning and stoplights along the rail line, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Blakey issued a strong endorsement for those systems Wednesday during
a news conference in Fullerton, saying that if they had been in place in
Orange County, the trains would have stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "The human error problem would be eliminated," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Wells not Tacoronte could be reached for comment Wednesday.
Their employer, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, did not return calls
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the union representing freight operators said it's too
early to pass judgment.</TE>
<TE>   History "has taught us that one should wait for all of the facts and
any tests that are being run on any signals and equipment to be
concluded," said Frank Wilner, spokesman for the United Transportation
Union. "We do not have all the facts."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Dawson, safety representative for UTU Local 811 in San
Bernardino, said he trained Tacoronte and vouched for the conductor's
skills.</TE>
<TE>   "Dean was knowledgeable," Dawson said. "He did really well in the
exams and physical parts of the training. I was impressed with him."</TE>
<TE>   Fellow employees described Tacoronte and Wells as reliable and
experienced professionals who did their jobs well. They expressed
disbelief that Wells missed the signal.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all talking about it, but there's only three people who know
exactly what happened out there," said one conductor who asked not to be
identified because of the investigation. "Those two guys and the
dispatcher they were talking to."</TE>
<TE>   Several engineers and conductors said Wednesday that fatigue because
of long work hours as well as equipment problems can make their working
conditions unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   Employees are given as little as seven hours off after working through
the night or more than 12 hours in a row, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Fatigue and work schedules are some of the human factors investigators
said they will review.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to look particularly at that 72-hour window before the crews
came on duty to see what may have factored in in terms of their
performance," Blakey said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no indication that the engineer of the freight train had
fallen asleep--he was properly sounding the horn at each crossing--and
blood tests were negative for signs of alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Drug test results will be completed Friday, but officials said there
are no indications he was under the influence.</TE>
<TE>   Railroad engineers must meet federal training and certification
requirements before they can operate a freight train, said Robert Gould,
spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration, which regulates safety
on the nation's train tracks.</TE>
<TE>   But as long as they adhere to federal guidelines, railroads are
responsible for certifying their own employees, Gould said.</TE>
<TE>   Gould said it is "way too soon . . . to be contemplating" whether his
agency will take action as a result of Tuesday's crash. The agency has
the power to levy fines and oversee the industry.</TE>
<TE>   The Metrolink train sustained $2.6 million in damage. The heavier,
bigger freight train suffered $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   At the crash site, the familiar sights and sounds had returned.
Traffic resumed on Orangethorpe Avenue and freight trains were once again
blaring their horns and chugging through Placentia.</TE>
<TE>   The Metrolink trains were also back on track shortly after noon.</TE>
<TE>   The only signs of the crash were the two mangled Metrolink trains on
the embankment under black tarps. A chain-link fence surrounded the cars
and NTSB investigators in white hard hats occasionally boarded them.
cars.</TE>
<TE>   The Metrolink crew, Blakey said, "did everything properly."</TE>
<TE>   The commuter train had been stopped for 10 seconds before the crash
occurred and engineer Mike Dudgeon had time to leave the cab, head toward
the back and warn passengers.</TE>
<TE>   "Our employees reacted as quickly as possible in a very dangerous

<DH>Change: Neighbors bemoan the tarnished image of Florence and
Normandie, a mostly quiet area being transformed by demographics.</DH>
<SE>One in a series about the riots.

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The intersection of Florence and Normandie avenues is where the
cameras will come this week to document the 10th anniversary of the Los
Angeles riots. This is where the first rocks were thrown, the first
injuries were recorded and the first loot was grabbed hours after four
police officers accused of beating Rodney G. King were acquitted.</LD>
<LD>   But the real legacy of Florence and Normandie lies in the lives of the
people who live around the intersection, like the people of West 71st
Street, a block to the north.</LD>
<LD>   This working-class slice of South-Central Los Angeles never looked
like a symbol of black rage, and it still doesn't. It's full of neat,
wood-frame houses, flowers, green lawns and children playing baseball.</LD>
<TE>   The despair lies under the surface. West 71st, like so much of
South-Central, has always been a place where aspiration battled
disappointment, increasingly losing more than it won. Today, you can find
people who still agonize over how the riots tarnished the place they call
home.</TE>
<TE>   "Our dreams are here," said Edward Riley, 75, a retired county
government procurement officer who has lived on 71st Street with his
wife, Jovann, since 1964. "We raised our family here, had backyard
barbecues. I played baseball with my son. Thanksgivings here. All here
from this house."</TE>
<TE>   Riley's lawn is a plush carpet. His geraniums and bougainvillea are in
spectacular bloom. To him and others, the block was always a notch up,
full of expectations that its children would go to college, the way
Riley's went to UCLA and Cal State Long Beach. But it became a place
where, too often, children got entangled in a world of drugs, gang
warfare and jail.</TE>
<TE>   White families were already moving out when Riley, an African
American, arrived. He saw dozens more flee a year later after the Watts
riots of 1965. There has been no mass exodus since the 1992 unrest, but
Riley experienced one profound change: The church he attended for decades
closed after membership dwindled to a handful. Blame demographics. The
black population within a quarter-mile of Normandie and 71st dropped from
72% in 1990 to 50% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't go to church anymore," he said solemnly. "I pray in my
bedroom."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of Normandie, two houses from Riley, Roy Lee Walker
has lived half his life on 71st. He's a 51-year-old California Highway
Patrol officer who has self-published a book about spiritual beliefs.
He's writing another one about living with the riots outside his door.</TE>
<TE>   It was this neighborhood where the first arresting officers were
forced into retreat, abandoning Florence and Normandie to an angry mob
whose televised violence spread over large swaths of the city. And it was
back to 71st Street that LAPD Chief Daryl Gates came two weeks later,
personally participating in the predawn raid that arrested a 19-year-old
resident of the block, gang member Damian Williams, in the near-fatal
beating of white truck driver Reginald O. Denny.</TE>
<TE>   Walker was at home that April 29 and saw the televised verdicts. He
watched the LAPD officers back down from rock- and bottle-throwing
crowds. He felt guilty that he didn't go in on a day off, but his wife
and 1-year-old daughter were not home and he wouldn't leave without them.</TE>
<TE>   For three nights, Roy and Laverne Walker watched fires, listened to
the gunshots, did without lights or a phone and slept on the floor for
safety. They decided they would move out of the neighborhood the moment
things calmed down.</TE>
<TE>   But somehow things seemed to return to normal, even improve. There was
a gang truce. The crime rate fell. Gunfire and the drone of police
helicopters did not plague the neighborhood as much.</TE>
<TE>   Then last year, a few days before Christmas, the Walker house was hit
11 times by gunfire around dinner time.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard the sounds and hit the floor," said Walker, who pointed out
the bullet holes in the house. "It was deliberate,"' Laverne said. The
motive remains unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "The riots never disturbed the sanctity of our home," Walker said.
"This was different."</TE>
<TE>   Now Walker wants to move out. But housing prices are so much higher
and retirement is near. "I may have stayed too long," he says.</TE>
<TE>A Legacy of Rage</TE>
<TE>   The wave of violence that would end in 54 deaths, more than 2,000
injuries and nearly $1 billion in damage began an hour after the verdicts
were read. Five young black men walked into a Korean-owned liquor store
three blocks west of Florence and Normandie. They grabbed several bottles
of malt liquor and hit the store owner's son over the head when he tried
to block their path. They shattered a storefront window and one yelled:
"This is for Rodney King!"</TE>
<TE>   In truth, for many it was not that simple. To some, the King beating
mattered less than the fact that the police had been acquitted by a
largely white jury. To others, the beating mattered less than the fatal
1991 shooting of a black teenager by a Korean merchant during an
altercation. Most African Americans saw the beating as the latest in a
long string of injustices. Residents of 71st Street had no trouble
recalling the families who lived in the Dalton Avenue apartments, a
couple miles north on Normandie, whose homes were left uninhabitable by a
police drug raid in 1988. That raid came at a time when Chief Gates was
flooding South-Central streets with officers in Operation Hammer, which
targeted gang members but swept up numerous innocent residents.</TE>
<TE>   In that context, "We didn't know Rodney King from a can of paint,"
said one rioter, a 25-year-old man named Melvin, who still lives on the
block and asked not to be identified by his full name. "We didn't care
anything about Rodney King."</TE>
<TE>   On that first afternoon of violence, 30 officers confronted 200
rioters at Normandie and 71st. The crowd had been made even more furious
by the officers' arrest of a combative young man named Mark Jackson.
Intimidated, the police pulled back.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, Reginald Denny drove his truck through Florence and
Normandie. He, like some other white and Asian motorists, was pulled from
his vehicle and beaten. The young man who hit Denny in the head with a
chunk of concrete was Jackson's half brother, Damian Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, one of the kids who used to play baseball in the street on
71st, had been raised by his mother, Georgiana Williams. Known as
"Grandma" to many who grew up on the block, Williams is a deeply
religious woman, the daughter of a Mississippi sharecropper who grew up
picking cotton. She became a nurse and moved to California, certain it
offered more opportunities to a woman than Vicksburg.</TE>
<TE>   She brought a Southern sense of hospitality to the street. "If someone
couldn't pay their light bill we'd chip in or if there wasn't food to eat
we'd share. That is the kind of neighborhood we had." Even as her son and
his friends in the 8-Tray Gangsters grew older, the home remained a place
of refuge.</TE>
<TE>   She also brought a deeply rooted sense of Southern respect and fear of
authority. "When I first heard about Rodney King, I thought he must have
done something terribly wrong to deserve such a beating," she said,
recalling her feelings that "police just don't beat you like that for
nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Even today, Georgiana Williams, 61, does not believe the man who
crushed Denny's skull on the videotape was her son. "Have you seen a
picture of Damian? He doesn't look like that. I say they don't know who
was at Florence and Normandie."</TE>
<TE>   Damian was eventually convicted of the beating and served four years
in prison. Once he was released, his mother moved to a three-bedroom
apartment in Compton to get Damian away from the criminal influences of
the block, as well as away from the eye of the LAPD, which she maintains
had targeted Damian because of his involvement in the riots.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't work. In 2000, Damian was arrested on charges of
participating in the killing of a man in a drug house not far from 71st
Street. He is in jail awaiting trial. His mother, who kept ownership of
their home when she moved, has finally put up a "For Sale" sign.</TE>
<TE>   "My only regret is that I couldn't keep him out of the neighborhood,"
said the mother, who has battled arthritis and survived colon cancer
during the last 10 years and still works. "But he really doesn't know any
other neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   "He has to work the hard head out of him," said half brother Jackson,
39, who works as a floor foreman for a transmission repair shop on
Crenshaw Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Another young man who hung out at the Williams house, Henry Watson,
was convicted of misdemeanor assault for placing his foot on Denny's
neck.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he served more than three years on a narcotics conviction. (He
maintains that police planted the evidence on him.) Five of his last 10
years have been behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no good time in prison time," said Watson, whose release
came two months before his father's death. "I made it home for him."</TE>
<TE>   Watson, 38, who grew up on 69th Street, sports a tattoo on his left
arm: "4-29-92 Florence and Normandie."</TE>
<TE>   "I know I just got caught up in the emotions," he said. "When I got
home I remember my mother asking me, 'Was that you on TV?' I said yes."</TE>
<TE>   The Denny trial and publicity surrounding it made him feel like a
celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like O.J., but on a smaller scale. I was ghetto fabulous. I'd
walk into a club and they would shine the spotlight on me. I went to a
store and an Asian storekeeper offered to buy me lunch. At another store
I was told, 'You too much trouble' and kicked out." He now operates a
limousine service.</TE>
<TE>Coming Back to Run a Local Landmark</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, two of the four lots at Florence and Normandie were
occupied--by Tom's Liquor and Deli and a gas station--and two were
vacant. Shortly after the riots, an Auto Zone was built on one lot, and
celebrated as part of the economic recovery. A second gas station filled
in the intersection later. Flowers grow from planters at three of the
corners, but not at the liquor store, which was sold after the riots and
no longer says "Tom's," just "Liquor."</TE>
<TE>   The presence of more commerce drew Darnell Nelms back home.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Nelms, 44, who lived on 71st in the late 1960s and early
'70s, bought the closed Art's Chilidog stand at Florence and Normandie,
an institution in the community since 1939, when hot dogs sold for 10
cents.</TE>
<TE>   Art's closed shortly after the riots when the original owner died.
"The area is coming back and I wanted to be a part of that," said Nelms,
a real estate agent who lives in the east San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   He's told his employees to continue Art's tradition of giving free hot
dogs to children with good grades, remembering getting one himself. "I'll
look at the report card and if I see like three A's and no U's, I'll give
them a free chili dog, a drink and bag of chips."</TE>
<TE>   As blacks have moved from the neighborhood, Latinos have moved in,
their numbers increasing from 25% in 1990 to 47% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Alvarez, 36, a Guatemalan immigrant who came to the U.S.
more than a decade ago, purchased his home on 71st three years ago at
$110,000 and recently was delighted to learn it is worth $160,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The neighborhood is getting better and better," said Alvarez, who
lives in the five-bedroom house with his wife and three sons. "You can't
find a house like this on a quiet street like this for the money I paid."
Happy as he is, he still won't permit his sons to play on the street. Too
dangerous. "If they want to play I'll take them to the park" for
organized sports.</TE>
<TE>   The kids who do play ball in the street every day know little of their
block's history.</TE>
<TE>   "Damian started it," said Brian Arguelles, 13, stepping up to the
plate, a red paint spot, in the middle of the street.</TE>
<TE>   "I was little," said Rickey White, 15. "My mother told me about it."</TE>
<TE>   The street game pauses for cars. There is a timeout for the ice cream
truck. Play resumes.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to play but none of the boys are going to let me in the game,"
said Marie Cole, an 11-year-old riding a scooter. "Why can't I play?" she
asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Because you're a girl!" one of the boys shouts back.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not funny," she says.</TE>
<TE>   A ball hit in the trees is an automatic home run. First base is a pole
on Mr. Priebe's fence. That's David Priebe, 64, the former neighborhood
milkman, who has lived on this block of 71st longer than anyone else. A
year after the riots, Priebe was described by one local newspaper as the
"white man in the 'hood."</TE>
<TE>   "What an epitaph," he jokes. He raised five children on the block
after moving here in 1960. Today he has 10 grandchildren. His daughter
purchased a home across the street and a son purchased another home a few
doors down.</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1992, he grabbed a hose and kept the flames from spreading to
his daughter's garage on the first night of the riots. He recalls Damian
Williams as the tough kid on the block who always spoke politely, and was
a favorite of Priebe's wife, who died in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The riots left Priebe bewildered and frightened, but determined to
stay. Ask him why he hasn't left and he answers, "Neighborhoods need
yards that have roses growing in them. This is my neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Priebe also publishes a monthly newsletter of poetry, Haiku Headlines,
which he sends to subscribers across the nation. March's eight-page
newsletter had 72 entries. He offers a poem of his own to describe the
place where he's staked his claim:</TE>
<TE>   the calla lilies</TE>
<TE>   flattened by the winds and rain</TE>
<TE>   have risen again</TE>

<HD>A High-Stakes Game With Top Al Qaeda 'Informant'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The drumbeat of threatening reports over the last week--terrorists
planning to detonate radioactive "dirty bombs" or attack the U.S.
financial system--has been all the more alarming because of their source:
the captured operational commander of the Al Qaeda network, who is now
being interrogated by U.S. authorities.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the FBI announced yet another warning, that terrorists
affiliated with Osama bin Laden may try to attack American shopping
centers and malls. Like the other alerts, authorities say, the
information was provided by Abu Zubeida, the nom de guerre of Bin Laden's
top aide, who was taken into custody in Pakistan last month.</LD>
<LD>   But why is Zubeida--a man apparently willing to die for his
cause--talking to his captors at all, much less providing them with
important information about the group's plans and operations?</LD>
<TE>   And why are U.S. officials, normally so tight-lipped about their
terrorism interrogations, spreading the word about his apparent
confessions?</TE>
<TE>   The answers, those close to the matter suggest, lie in the elaborate
psychological and tactical struggle underway between American
interrogators and their most valuable witness in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   It is a multilevel effort that involves not just what Zubeida and his
captors are saying to each other, but the impression that they are trying
to create among those outside the interrogation room--both in the
terrorism community and in the nations where the U.S. campaign against
terror is being fought.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials recognize that Zubeida may be deliberately trying to
confuse and mislead them, mixing false leads with others in a way that
leaves them unable to determine the truth. But they concede that they
have no alternative than to take what he is saying extremely seriously,
and to act on it immediately and aggressively.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida is trained in the art of misinformation. His interrogators are
trained to foil such techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get someone that plugged in to Al Qaeda's inner workings,
you have to listen," one Bush administration official said. "This is the
E.F. Hutton of the interrogation process; you have to pay attention.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you trust him? Trust is the wrong word," the official said. "Can
you dismiss it? Absolutely not."</TE>
<TE>Interrogators Play Their Own Games</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials apparently are also engaging in their own manipulation,
using the Zubeida reports to, in the words of one FBI agent, "tickle the
wires."</TE>
<TE>   That involves leaking Zubeida's statements in the hope that they
create a buzz among his Al Qaeda followers around the world. They would
then communicate among themselves in person or by phone and e-mail--and
hopefully provide more leads in the ongoing terrorism investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "If it seems choreographed, it probably was," the FBI agent said of
the sudden burst of official disclosures about what Zubeida is saying.
"You insert some information into a criminal investigation and see what
happens."</TE>
<TE>   The technique is just one move in a chess game similar to those the
U.S. played for decades with Soviet spies during the Cold War and with
organized crime figures at home.</TE>
<TE>   It is now being adapted to a new high-stakes struggle with
international terrorists. But even those U.S. officials involved in such
interrogations over the years concede that they have never encountered
subjects quite like Zubeida and his cohorts. All the old tricks simply
don't work anymore, they say.</TE>
<TE>'A Different Kind of Human Being'</TE>
<TE>   "This is a different kind of criminal, a different kind of mentality,
a different kind of human being than we have dealt with in domestic crime
or in the Cold War era," said John Martin, a former senior Justice
Department official who oversaw espionage and terrorism investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "At least there you knew what buttons to push to get their
cooperation: the opportunity for freedom and a better life, safety for
their families. But those things don't work with these people," Martin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Little is known about the interrogation sessions with Zubeida, held at
an undisclosed location by military, intelligence and law enforcement
officials. The interrogators are familiar with Al Qaeda terrorist
training manuals, which advise operatives to reveal nothing other than
disinformation.</TE>
<TE>   The interrogators are actively trying to corroborate what they have
learned from Zubeida by checking it against existing intelligence and
statements from other prisoners--including a top Zubeida subordinate, Ibn
al-Shaykh al-Libi, who is also believed to be talking.</TE>
<TE>   Several U.S. officials echoed Martin's assessment that the old ways of
interrogation are lost on Islamic terrorists, such as Zubeida, who crave
martyrdom. They say Zubeida apparently knows that U.S. law prohibits the
use of torture, but they note that other measures are being applied,
including sleep deprivation and psychological manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   But virtually no one believes that Zubeida is cooperating for any
reason other than to toy with his interrogators, and perhaps to send them
in one direction while his co-conspirators continue plans to attack
somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   And that has put U.S. officials in a bind, they concede.</TE>
<TE>   The newest warning, about attacks on shopping malls, was based on
"unsubstantiated and nonspecific information" provided by Zubeida,
federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's 56 field offices were alerted but only out of an abundance
of caution.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also said they had been picking up nonspecific threats to
banks for years but felt obligated to alert the financial community on
Friday about the potential for attacks even though Zubeida's information
was, again, uncorroborated and not specific.</TE>
<TE>   They said Bin Laden's quest for "dirty bombs" that would spew
radiation and cause panic within a large radius has been so well
publicized that Zubeida theoretically could be telling his interrogators
about things he read over the Internet before his March 28 capture.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't believe a word this guy says. He is clearly an enemy of the
country and he is going to provide disinformation, send us down the wrong
path and cause us to burn untold resources," said Robert Blitzer, former
head of the FBI's counterterrorism division. "But I understand where the
bureau is coming from. He is a top Al Qaeda member and if we sit on [the
information] and don't do anything and something happens, the world will
be on top of us for it. They are damned if they do and damned if they
don't."</TE>
<TE>Debate Over Whether to Release Information</TE>
<TE>   But Blitzer added that authorities are also turning the tables on
Zubeida by spreading the word that he is talking to them. Blitzer used
the same technique himself, he said, with suspects in the first World
Trade Center terrorist attack in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "We really agonized over going public with these things," Blitzer
said. "But . . . if something was planned, maybe the bad guys would see
that law enforcement was on top of it and think 'maybe we should try
something else.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still, some oppose the notion of publicizing what terrorists are
telling authorities. And they caution that if Zubeida did provide any
specific information, authorities would be foolish to discuss it.</TE>
<TE>   "If we keep in mind the goals of the terrorists--to disrupt and
destroy our way of life, our economy, to make us blink, to keep us in a
panic--they win," said Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), vice chairman of
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   "So I believe that if we learn things from interrogating a known
terrorist, we ought to keep it to ourselves," Shelby said.</TE>

<HD>CIA Warns of Chinese Plans for Cyber-Attacks on U.S.</HD>
<DH>Defense: Analysts fear government and private efforts to sabotage
federal Internet sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. intelligence officials believe the Chinese military is working
to launch wide-scale cyber-attacks on American and Taiwanese computer
networks, including Internet-linked military systems considered
vulnerable to sabotage, according to a classified CIA report.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, U.S. authorities are bracing for a possible wave of hacking
attacks by Chinese students against the United States in coming weeks,
according to the analysis. The confidential alert, which was reviewed by
The Times, was sent to intelligence officials a week ago.</LD>
<LD>   Although U.S. officials have voiced concerns about individual hackers
in China who have defaced federal and private Web sites, the United
States has resisted publicly linking the Chinese government to those
attacks or to broader cyber-style warfare.</LD>
<TE>   The new CIA report, however, makes clear that U.S. intelligence
analysts have become increasingly concerned that authorities in Beijing
are actively planning to damage and disrupt U.S. computer systems through
the use of Internet hacking and computer viruses.</TE>
<TE>   Although the assessment concludes that China has not yet acquired the
technical sophistication to do broad damage to U.S. and Taiwanese
systems, it maintains that this is the "intended goal" of the People's
Liberation Army in China. "The mission of Chinese special forces includes
physical sabotage" of vulnerable systems, the report says--which some
analysts said is driven by China's hostility toward Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese Embassy in Washington insisted Wednesday, however, that
Beijing is only conducting computer research that is strictly defensive
in nature.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not the Chinese government's policy to disrupt the computer
system of any other country," said Larry Wu, an official in the embassy's
science and technology section.</TE>
<TE>   "We do research on the security of computers, of course--self-defense
to understand how a hacker can get into our computer systems so we can
defend it," he said. "But China has never assumed an offensive stance
with regards to computer technology."</TE>
<TE>   But several specialists in Chinese security and military affairs said
the CIA's conclusions jibe with their own observations about China's
research into offensive-minded cyber-tools.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be very worried about this issue," said James Mulvenon, a
China analyst at the Rand Corp. think tank who has done extensive studies
into Chinese computer capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province, appears to be the
driving force behind the Chinese interest in hacking and viruses,
Mulvenon said. Under one scenario, if China were to make good on its
long-standing threat to invade Taiwan, the Chinese military could then
seek to deploy widespread computer disruptions against American and
Taiwanese military systems to slow any effort by U.S. forces to intervene
in Taiwan's defense, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The issue threatens to inflame what are invariably tense relations
between the United States and the Communist regime in China, relations
already frayed by a volley of charges and counter charges during the last
several years over alleged nuclear, military and political espionage.</TE>
<TE>   Relations hit a low point last year after a U.S. spy plane collided
with a Chinese jet fighter, triggering an international standoff over the
return of the plane's 24 Navy crewmen. China detained the crew members
for 11 days and returned the disassembled plane months later.</TE>
<TE>   Recent months have seen a warming in relations as the Bush
administration secured China's cooperation in the war on terrorism. But
China has become upset by what it sees as the White House's increasingly
favorable overtures toward Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA's assessment discusses Taiwan and the United States, revealing
that U.S. intelligence officials believe both are targets of the Chinese
military.</TE>
<TE>   "The People's Liberation Army does not yet have the capability to
carry out its intended goal of disrupting Taiwanese military and civilian
infrastructures or U.S. military logistics using computer virus attacks,"
said the CIA's report, which was included in a broader national security
assessment that authorities distributed to intelligence officials.</TE>
<TE>   "China's virus attack capabilities are similar to those of
sophisticated hackers and are limited to temporary disruption of sectors
that use the Internet," the CIA review said. "A Chinese virus attack is
capable of reaching e-mail communications, lap tops brought into China,
and U.S. Internet-based military computers."</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. intelligence official who was briefed on the issue but asked
not to be identified said analysts believe that, although the most
sensitive U.S. military databases are secure from hackers and viruses,
Internet-based military systems that are used for communications with
bases around the world and with outside military vendors could be
vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   "These aren't the keys to the kingdom we're talking about," the
official said. "There's no danger that the Chinese are going to hack into
our nuclear launch codes, but there is the danger they could gather
useful intelligence from penetrating some of the less sensitive networks
that the Department of Defense utilizes all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   Recent U.S. intelligence indicates, the official said, "that the
Chinese government is actively and aggressively working on their
cyber-war capability. They have a lot of people and a lot of brainpower,
and they're smart enough to appreciate that a significant aspect of any
future armed conflict is going to be cyber in nature."</TE>
<TE>   Another government official who asked not to be identified cautioned,
however, that the immediate threat posed by Chinese computer disruptions
is fairly limited.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something we're certainly concerned about. But in terms of
their being able to disrupt Taiwan or U.S. military and civilian
infrastructure, they can't do it yet. That's the story."</TE>
<TE>   The concept of nations launching cyber-attacks against their enemies
is a relatively new phenomenon, but it is drawing rising concern from
U.S. authorities as they assess vulnerability in the national computer
infrastructure. In an effort to beef up security, budget planners are
projecting an increase of more than 50% next year in overall computer
security, bringing the total to more than $4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA report does not reveal how intelligence analysts arrived at
their conclusions, and Jonathan Pollack, chairman of the strategic
research department at the Naval War College, cautioned that there are
still many unanswered questions about China's plans.</TE>
<TE>   "China is still an issue that worries Americans deeply, and sometimes
the intelligence community gets a head of steam on these things and can
go off on tangents that may not be substantiated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the spy plane confrontation triggered an avalanche of about
1,200 attacks against U.S. government and commercial Web sites that were
disrupted or defaced. Many of the attacks appeared to have been generated
by students in China, with private hackers leaving patriotic pro-China
messages or vowing revenge for the death of a Chinese pilot in the plane
collision. Several hundred attacks on Chinese Web sites were blamed on
American hackers, although some U.S. technology experts discounted that
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA assessment said China's "nonstate hacking community continues
to pose the most immediate threat to U.S. computer networks."</TE>
<TE>   It went on to warn that hackers in China "appear to be organizing for
cyber-attacks again this spring, particularly during student breaks early
next month and around the anniversary of the EP-3 [surveillance plane]
incident."</TE>
<TE>   The anniversary of the EP-3 collision passed uneventfully this month.
But private security groups say they too have picked up on possible
Chinese-based attacks in coming weeks--tied to the plane episode as well
as China's national youth day on May 4 and the May 8 anniversary of the
U.S.'s accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "We're warning our people about it and making sure everyone has their
Web sites updated with the proper patches" to guard against
denial-of-service attacks and other hacking, said Michael Cheek, director
of intelligence for iDefense, a security intelligence service that has
government and corporate clients around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. intelligence official said that analysts suspect last year's
hackings had the "tacit blessing," and even perhaps the active
involvement, of the Chinese government.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a report due out next month from Mulvenon and the Rand Corp.,
which does research for the U.S. government, will allege that the Chinese
government was directly involved in at least one round of hack attacks.</TE>
<TE>   After a spate of attacks against Web sites in the United States,
Australia, Canada and England maintained by the Falun Gong religious
movement--which China considers an "evil cult"--Mulvenon said his
investigation unearthed evidence showing that at least one U.S. attack
originated with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very clear to us that this was the ministry's doing, and it was
a deliberate attempt to smear Falun Gong," he said.</TE>

<HD>Israel Asks: Is It Time for Arafat to Leave?</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Sharon reportedly believes that some in the U.S. would
support an expulsion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Fresh from what it sees as an overwhelming military victory in the
West Bank, the Israeli government is openly debating whether the time has
come to expel Yasser Arafat from this land.</LD>
<LD>   Doing so would mark another step in Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan
to relegate the Palestinian Authority to history and promote a more
cooperative leadership in its place, following a three-week military
campaign that left much of Palestinian society and infrastructure a
shambles. It is a strategy he has pursued in the past, with problematic
consequences.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon has already come close to expelling his longtime nemesis.</LD>
<TE>   Only a 2 a.m. telephone call last month from Secretary of State Colin
L. Powell--just hours after a Palestinian suicide bomber wiped out entire
families at a Passover Seder--stopped Sharon from snatching Arafat out of
the West Bank city of Ramallah and casting him into exile, according to
sources.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Sharon on March 29 sent tanks and infantry smashing through
Arafat's compound walls, where they stopped outside his front door and
have remained since.</TE>
<TE>   And when Powell came calling again this month, this time in person,
and asked Sharon for a promise to keep his hands off Arafat, the Israeli
leader demurred. He would not invade Arafat's inner sanctum during or
immediately after Powell's visit. But beyond that, all bets were off.
Powell left the region last week.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, aides said, is increasingly convinced that others in the Bush
administration would back--at least tacitly--a decision to expel Arafat,
and he also believes that support for such a move among Israelis is
growing.</TE>
<TE>   There are risks and reasons not to do it.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as January, Sharon argued to his right-wing followers that
it was better to leave Arafat where he was: trapped inside his compound,
surrounded by Israeli tanks and virtually cut off from the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   In exile, by contrast, he might become a living martyr free to roam
the Arab world and Europe, ginning up support, money, weapons and
followers. He could call the shots for whatever was left of a Palestinian
resistance or uprising from a relatively safe distance.</TE>
<TE>   Expelling Arafat also would shatter the already strained relations
that Israel maintains with its only relatively friendly Arab neighbors,
Egypt and Jordan, and stir trouble inside Sharon's ruling coalition with
the more moderate members from the Labor Party.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon's advisors say the balance has begun to tip the other way:
Sharon's calculation is that the world would be less likely to welcome
Arafat with open arms and might treat him like a pariah.</TE>
<TE>   "The main downside is that he would use his victimization as a cynical
instrument to continue terror and incitement abroad, and we could
certainly envision a scenario where he is given the red-carpet treatment
by world leaders," senior Sharon advisor Danny Ayalon said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe this risk is somewhat mitigated now by the fact that after
this operation we have hard evidence linking [Arafat] not just to the
inspiration of terror but to involvement in the instruction and financing
of terror."</TE>
<TE>   Ayalon was alluding to papers seized from Arafat's headquarters and
other Palestinian Authority offices that Israel believes substantiate a
closer link between Arafat and the more militant armed Palestinian
groups.</TE>
<TE>   The other benefit, as Sharon sees it, is that Arafat's absence from
the Palestinian territories would allow an alternative leadership to
flourish, Ayalon said.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's not here, and not here in a way that everyone knows it's for
good, then there is a better chance for a new leadership to emerge," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy is one that Sharon employed in the past without good
results, analysts here note. In 1982, Sharon, as defense minister,
launched Israel's invasion of Lebanon, reaching Beirut and laying siege
to Arafat. After 88 days and with U.S. intervention, the Palestinian
leader was allowed to escape to Tunisia. Sharon, seeking a malleable
ally, helped shepherd in Bashir Gemayel as the new president of Lebanon.
Gemayel was assassinated before he could take office.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, Sharon established Palestinian Village Leagues in the West
Bank to promote local leaders opposed to Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization. Most either had to resign or were assassinated.</TE>
<TE>   If Arafat is ousted by the Israelis, it would be next to impossible
for any self-respecting Palestinian to take his place. Anyone who did so
would have no following and little credibility--or would have to take
extremist positions to earn legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot get someone more moderate [than Arafat] who is also able
to govern," said Joseph Alpher, an Israeli strategic analyst. "It is an
illusion to think that just because he is in exile, people will not be
taking their cues from him."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli political analysts said another sign that Sharon might be
moving closer to expelling Arafat is evident in the hard turn to the
right that he is taking within his government. He recently added to his
Cabinet a retired army general who advocates deporting most Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   This week, during a Cabinet session, Sharon stunned his allies in the
Labor Party by announcing--and reportedly banging his fist on the table
as he said it--that he will not consider dismantling a single Jewish
settlement, not even the most remote and isolated ones in the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Peace advocates here maintain that there cannot be a resolution to the
Arab-Israeli conflict without the evacuation of at least some
settlements, and Sharon's statement seemed to remove the basis for
political negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   On both the expulsion of Arafat and the expensive maintenance of
remote settlements, Sharon appears to be ignoring the advice of most of
his military.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's longtime associate, Uri Shani, who ran his office and was
considered the person closest to Sharon outside the family, quit as chief
of staff this week. Local news reports said Shani was dismayed as his
boss' increasingly hard-line positions threatened to alienate and drive
away the Labor Party, which would in turn jeopardize the stability of the
coalition government.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, as always, has one eye on his chief political rival, former
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is likely to challenge Sharon for
leadership of their right-wing Likud Party. Netanyahu demanded this week
that Sharon expel Arafat immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu, speaking from the U.S., where he is on tour, told Israeli
media that he has been counseling Sharon that a move on Arafat will be
greeted favorably.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to him: Arik, get rid of Arafat," Netanyahu said, using
Sharon's nickname. "The American people will understand, and there will
be a substantial amount of support."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration certainly has been frustrated by what it sees
as Arafat's failure to rein in violence. But Powell was told in strong
terms by Arab heads of state during his recent trip that they would not
support the peace process if Israel tried to exclude Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat is recognized by the Palestinian people as their leader. . . .
So whether one approves of that or disapproves it, or likes it or doesn't
like it, it is a reality. It is a reality that I had to deal with,"
Powell told a news conference before leaving Jerusalem last week.</TE>
<TE>   There is another danger for Israel if it attempts to deport Arafat: He
might be hurt or killed in any Israeli military operation mounted to
capture him. Taking Arafat would involve storming the small part of his
compound that he and his armed guards still control.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Israelis have seen how Arafat has used his confinement to
enhance his stature, and that is something they'd like to stop.</TE>
<TE>   "This inflated sense he's gotten that he's indispensable for the West
is driving the prime minister to sound a bit more threatening," said Eran
Lerman, a retired senior Israeli military intelligence officer who
directs the Jerusalem office of the American Jewish Committee. "It's
important to rattle his sense of security."</TE>
<TE>   Alpher predicted that Arafat will not be hitting the road immediately
but that the next round of suicide bombings or other attacks on Israelis
will probably set his travels in motion.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel is not going to grab Arafat and exile him tomorrow," he said.
"But the next set of provocations, which is inevitable, will bring about
the next [military] campaign, and maybe it will be that campaign that
brings about Arafat's expulsion."</TE>

<HD>A Hermit Nation Opens Its Doors a Crack in Spring</HD>
<DH>Asia: North Korea has received visits by the South's envoy and from
foreigners. Its overtures fuel speculation of a regime looking to change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHEJU CITY, South Korea
</DL>
<LD>Even though he presides over one of the world's most shut-off
societies, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il keeps abreast of world affairs
by logging on to the Internet. On recent trips to China and Russia, he
was an inquisitive sightseer, closely studying the effects of capitalism.</LD>
<LD>   This description of the reclusive 60-year-old comes from diplomats who
recently returned from rare trips to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital,
made in an effort to coax the regime out of its isolation. They believe
that Kim is eager to bring foreign investment and outside influences into
his bastion of undiluted communism--if it can be done without endangering
his hold on power.</LD>
<LD>   "He really wants to open up and reform his economy, but he doesn't
know how to do it," said Lim Dong Won, a South Korean presidential envoy
who spent five hours closeted with Kim this month.</LD>
<TE>   "Kim Jong Il is emerging as someone who is increasingly aware of the
outside world," said Donald P. Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South
Korea, who met with two North Korean officials in Pyongyang this month.
"There are indications that he wants North Korea to rejoin the world."</TE>
<TE>   After months of brooding over President Bush's "axis of evil"
designation, North Korea appears to be coming out of its pique--even if
only because it wants to loosen purse strings.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, given that Pyongyang is hardly a popular stop on the
diplomatic circuit, the recent visits amount to a veritable flurry of
activity. In the weather-report lingo so often applied to Korean
relations, this could be called the Pyongyang spring.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg's trip to Pyongyang, although unofficial, marked the first time
that a high-ranking American had traveled to the North Korean capital
since then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited in October 2000.
It is expected to pave the way for an official trip by U.S. special envoy
Jack Pritchard within the next six to eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's nearly moribund "sunshine
policy" of engagement with North Korea also gained a reprieve with the
Pyongyang visit of his special envoy this month. Reunions between
separated Korean families are scheduled to resume Sunday after a more
than yearlong hiatus, and North Korea appears to be talking in earnest
again about road and rail links to the South.</TE>
<TE>   Other recent visitors to Pyongyang have included Indonesian President
Megawati Sukarnoputri, an old friend of Kim Jong Il.</TE>
<TE>   The improvement in North Korea's attitude most likely stems from
mercenary motives. Sales of its main export--missiles--have dried up
since Sept. 11 because of heightened concerns about terrorism. Shortages
of food and electricity have left the country chronically dependent on
foreign donors. The North's agreement to resume talks and family reunions
was accompanied by a pledge from South Korea that it will supply 200,000
tons of fertilizer and 300,000 tons of rice.</TE>
<TE>   Cynics, of which there are many, say the North is doing the bare
minimum diplomatically to keep the foreign aid flowing.</TE>
<TE>   "They are trying to find a way out without changing the system," said
Jean-Jacques Grauhar, who spent seven years as a business consultant in
Pyongyang and now runs the European Chamber of Commerce in Seoul. "They
are trying to gain time."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most mysterious world leaders, Kim took over the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea after the 1994 death of his father and the
nation's founder, Kim Il Sung. Despite Kim Jong Il's reputation in his
youth as a capricious playboy, some believe that they have seen in him
glimmers of a future Mikhail Gorbachev who, like the former Soviet
leader, would reform the system.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes soared after June 2000, when South Korea's Kim made a historic
trip to Pyongyang, but there has been little tangible progress.</TE>
<TE>   Former U.S. Ambassador Gregg, who spoke with reporters this month at a
peace conference here in the main town on Cheju island, said that Kim
Jong Il logs on daily to the Internet, paying close attention to the
outside world and studying the changes in China and Russia for clues on
what to do in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   After a trip to Moscow last year by rail, Kim sent a thank-you note to
Russian President Vladimir V. Putin in which he wrote, according to
Gregg: "You have made wise choices. Communism will never return to
Russia."</TE>
<TE>   William J. Perry, a defense secretary and special envoy to North Korea
under the Clinton administration, echoed the view that Pyongyang is
looking to change.</TE>
<TE>   "The North Korean government believes it is in their self-interest to
come into the modern world and to do what they need to do to engage South
Korea and the United States," Perry said at the same conference. "They
are not doing us a favor. It is in their self-interest."</TE>
<TE>   Although relations with the United States have been frozen, North
Korea has been seeking to strengthen its ties with other nations. It is
trying to bring in foreign tourists to attend a festival that is to begin
later this month to commemorate the 90th birthday of founder Kim. Two
international trade fairs are scheduled this year in Pyongyang, one in
May and another in June, and last weekend, North Korea held its first
computer software exposition in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Compensating for the lack of progress on the U.S. front, Pyongyang has
turned to Russia. Kim Jong Il made a surprise appearance last month at an
Easter party at the Russian Embassy in Pyongyang, and negotiations are
underway about linking Russia's Trans-Siberian Railroad with North Korean
lines. In an unusual display of hospitality, Kim threw a large dinner
this month for Vladimir A. Yakovlev, the governor of St. Petersburg.</TE>
<TE>   With Japan, North Korea has shown renewed interest in resolving a
dispute that has long blocked the normalization of relations: the
whereabouts of Japanese citizens allegedly abducted to North Korea. North
Korea said last week that talks between the North Korean and Japanese Red
Cross organizations will take place this month.</TE>
<TE>   But diplomats believe that none of these efforts will help North Korea
if it doesn't address the Bush administration's concerns about missile
sales and the suspected development of weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   During his visit to Pyongyang, South Korean special envoy Lim carried
with him a nine-page handwritten letter from Kim Dae Jung to the North
Korean leader warning him that dire consequences could be in store if the
North didn't start dealing with the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "It is now time . . . to stop clinging to the past and to explore new
ways to effectively talk and deal with the current U.S. administration,"
Lim quoted the letter as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Clinton administration, the U.S. and North Korea appeared to
be heading toward normalization of relations, but that ground to a halt
after Bush took office. And the antipathy between the two nations only
deepened after the president's State of the Union speech in January, with
his "axis of evil" comments.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has agreed in principle to meeting special envoy
Pritchard, but no date has been set. Diplomats say they are optimistic
that the meeting will take place, barring any fresh flare-ups of tension,
such as occurred with the "axis of evil" speech.</TE>

<HD>Spanish Probe Broadens</HD>
<DH>Europe: Partner of alleged terrorist financier is held. Officials
detail money trail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADRID
</DL>
<LD>The Spanish interior minister released details Wednesday on how
alleged terrorist financiers, hiding behind a facade of respectability,
used profits from their construction and real estate companies to fund Al
Qaeda activities around the world.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, police made their second arrest in two days in a crackdown
on the alleged operation, taking into custody a business partner of a
Syrian-born Spaniard detained Tuesday. A third man was arrested earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation has documented the movement of hundreds of thousands
of dollars to significant figures linked to the Sept. 11 attacks in the
U.S., the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, an attempted
assassination in Yemen and other terrorist acts, according to Interior
Minister Mariano Rajoy.</LD>
<TE>   "As far as we know, the suspects dedicated themselves to real estate,
constructing residences, etc.," Rajoy said at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   The profiles of the three suspected financiers contrast with those of
other alleged Al Qaeda operatives whose cells around Europe have been
dismantled. Many suspects financed themselves through crimes such as
credit card fraud; many come from backgrounds of student radicalism,
immigrant ghettos or prisons.</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown in Madrid, however, has targeted a group of Syrians who
immigrated here decades ago, married Spanish women, obtained citizenship
and established middle- and even upper-middle-class lives. If the men are
guilty, they are the ultimate "sleeper" terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Accustomed to stereotypes of shaggy fanatics and scruffy illegal
immigrants, Spaniards were taken aback by the appearance of alleged chief
financier Mohammed Galeb Kalaje Zouaydi, the dapper businessman arrested
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested Zouaydi's business partner, Ghasoub Abrash Ghalyoun,
at his office Wednesday. Another partner, Bassam Dalati Satut, was jailed
in November, along with seven other alleged accomplices of the Sept. 11
hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Dalati's arrest stunned his friends. Not only does his non-Muslim
Spanish wife work in a government ministry, their children attend a
British school, according to his lawyers. But investigators say they
found the name of a known Al Qaeda training camp boss on a document
locked in a trunk in one of the children's bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   As for Zouaydi, authorities allege that a global money trail connects
him to an international rogue's gallery of suspects. Instead of
laundering illegal proceeds, police said, he donated to criminal causes.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say they documented transfers of about $44,000 to Imad
Eddin Barakat Yarkas, the alleged boss of the major Al Qaeda cell based
in Madrid. About $208,000 went to two Islamic nongovernmental
organizations in Belgium run by Nabil Sayadi, who allegedly had close
ties to a man convicted in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, police said.</TE>
<TE>   About $100,000 from the financiers flowed to Mohammed Bahaiah,
described by Spanish investigators as Osama bin Laden's courier between
Afghanistan and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Ministry provided a diagram that also accused Zouaydi of
channeling about $15,000 to two Barakat associates in Germany. One of the
men--Syrian-born importer-exporter Mamoun Darkazanli--allegedly was an
associate of suspected Sept. 11 hijack leader Mohamed Atta, Spanish
police said.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Ministry described transfers amounting to about $600,000;
the total funding by Zouaydi's operation is believed to have reached $2
million, according to a senior law enforcement official.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Spanish accusations, Darkazanli and the other man remain
free. Rajoy said the Spanish investigation could contribute to a criminal
case in Germany against Darkazanli, whose bank accounts there have been
frozen, and the other man, Abdul Fattah Zammar.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate case, German police arrested a suspect Wednesday after
saying they smashed a terrorist cell with the arrest of 11 alleged
Islamic extremists the day before. All 12 men, said to belong to the Al
Tawhid group, were nabbed in raids across Germany after agents who had
been watching their purported leader concluded that the cell was plotting
attacks on German targets.</TE>

<HD>U.S., Russia Still Split Over Arms Cuts</HD>
<DH>Negotiations: American leaves talks early. The nations differ over
fate of deactivated nuclear warheads and verification of any reductions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Negotiations between the United States and Russia on an accord to
dramatically cut offensive nuclear weapons hit an apparent snag
Wednesday, with a top U.S. negotiator departing early from scheduled
talks and a senior Russian official saying that an agreement is not a
certainty.</LD>
<LD>   Defense analysts here said the stumbling block was most likely the
Russian military, which does not wish to see President Vladimir V. Putin
making any more significant concessions to Washington.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is a proposed agreement for each country to cut the number of
its strategic nuclear weapons to between 1,700 and 2,200, a significant
reduction from their current levels of between 6,000 and 7,000 warheads
each, by 2010.</LD>
<TE>   Putin sought the pact because his government is hard-pressed to
continue paying the cost of maintaining its vast arsenal of nuclear
weapons left over from the Cold War but does not wish to be forced to
make big cutbacks unilaterally.</TE>
<TE>   But some retired Russian generals, who are thought to reflect the
concerns of the country's military establishment, have said publicly that
they are opposed to the deal because the United States intends only to
stockpile, and not destroy, its deactivated weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov, who was leading the Russian
side in the current round of talks, conceded on Russian television that
it was still questionable whether an agreement would be
reached--particularly in time for President Bush's planned summit with
Putin in Moscow late next month, as both sides had hoped.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't yet say whether we will have this treaty or not, because
there are certain differences in terms of accountability of the
reductions [and] the methods of reduction," he told state-controlled ORT
television's late-night news show Wednesday. He said the chief stumbling
block was how to verify weapons cuts and ensure that they are permanent.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials would not specify a reason for the early departure
Wednesday from Moscow of U.S. Undersecretary of State John R. Bolton and
his arms-reduction team after one day of talks, when two days were
originally planned.</TE>
<TE>   Officials noted, however, that discussions between the countries could
resume as early as this weekend, when Deputy Secretary of State Richard
L. Armitage visits Moscow, or on May 3, when U.S. Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell and Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov are due to
have their next meeting, in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Before the talks began Tuesday, Bolton sounded optimistic, saying that
"the relationship between the United States and Russia has fundamentally
changed" and that the new agreement would be crafted to reflect that
change.</TE>
<TE>   However, a lingering resentment remains in Russia, especially among
senior generals, over past concessions to the United States, military and
political analysts here believe.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Maj. Gen. Vladimir Dvorkin, for one, told a news conference in
Moscow on Tuesday that he considered it "mad" for Russia to proceed with
any treaty that would leave it at a numerical disadvantage in land-based
nuclear weapons, which would occur if the United States merely stored its
deactivated arsenal while Russia destroyed its weaponry to save funds.</TE>
<TE>   From the hard-liners' viewpoint, Russia in the last year has been too
docile--eventually accepting the announced U.S. withdrawal from the 1972
Antiballistic Missile Treaty and giving a cautious green light to a U.S.
military presence in Central Asia and Georgia, former Soviet lands that
many here still regard as part of Russia's strategic sphere of influence.</TE>
<TE>   Putin's decision last year to withdraw the remaining Russian troops
from Soviet-era bases in Vietnam and Cuba without getting any specific
concessions from the United States in return also has rankled some in the
military establishment.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the political will to sign this new reduction agreement,
there is a lot of resistance to it among the Defense Ministry top brass
and Foreign Ministry diplomats who don't quite appreciate such a close
cooperation between Russia and the United States in this sensitive
sphere," said Pavel Felgenhauer, an independent defense analyst who
writes for several Russian newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   He said the generals therefore were looking for "mostly minor
technical points to make a fuss about and thus snag the talks."</TE>
<TE>   Resistance is stiff in the military, agreed Viktor A. Kremenyuk,
deputy director of the USA-Canada Institute, a Moscow think tank.
"President Putin is a commander in chief of the armed forces. But what
can he do when the generals on the general staff and the Defense Ministry
tell him that we can't go on with such reductions and concessions? Fire
them all?"</TE>
<TE>   Even though the president remains popular, "part of the society and
the political establishment wonder whether Putin is not sick with
Gorbachev and Kozyrev disease," Kremenyuk said. He was referring to
former Communist leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Boris N.
Yeltsin's former foreign minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, both of whom have
been vilified by nationalists in Russia as having caved in to the West.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Cardinals See Need to Reaffirm Moral Lessons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These are excerpts from the U.S. cardinals' statement at the end of
a meeting at the Vatican:</LD>
<LD>   In communion with the pope [the participants] reaffirm certain basic
principles:</LD>
<LD>   1. The sexual abuse of minors is rightly considered a crime by society
and is an appalling sin in the eyes of God, above all when it is
perpetrated by priests and religious whose vocation is to help persons to
lead holy lives before God and men.</LD>
<TE>   2. There is a need to convey to the victims and their families a
profound sense of solidarity and to provide appropriate assistance in
recovering faith and receiving pastoral care.</TE>
<TE>   3. Even if the cases of true pedophilia on the part of priests and
religious are few, all the participants recognized the gravity of the
problem. In the meeting, the quantitative terms of the problem were
discussed, since the statistics are not very clear in this regard.
Attention was drawn to the fact that almost all the cases involved
adolescents and therefore were not cases of true pedophilia.</TE>
<TE>   4. Together with the fact that a link between celibacy and pedophilia
cannot be scientifically maintained, the meeting reaffirmed the value of
priestly celibacy as a gift of God to the church.</TE>
<TE>   5. Given the doctrinal issues underlying the deplorable behavior in
question, certain lines of response have been proposed:</TE>
<TE>   a. The pastors of the church need clearly to promote the correct moral
teaching of the church and publicly to reprimand individuals who spread
dissent and groups which advance ambiguous approaches to pastoral care.</TE>
<TE>   b. a new and serious apostolic visitation of seminaries and other
institutes of formation must be made without delay, with particular
emphasis on . . . the need for a deeper study of the criteria of
suitability of candidates to the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   c. It would be fitting for the bishops of the United States Conference
of Catholic Bishops to ask the faithful to join them in observing a
national day of prayer and penance, in reparation for the offenses
perpetrated and in prayer to God for the conversion of sinners and the
reconciliation of victims.</TE>
<TE>   6. All the participants have seen this time as a call to a greater
fidelity to the mystery of the church. . . . We cannot underestimate, in
the words of the holy father, "the power of Christian conversion, that
radical decision to turn away from sin and back to God, which reaches the
depths of a person's soul and can work extraordinary change." At the same
time, as his holiness also stated, "People need to know that there is no
place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the
young. . . . "</TE>

<HD>The Afghan Warnings That Went Unheeded at Tora Bora</HD>
<DH>Asia: U.S.' decision not to send in its own ground troops might
have enabled Bin Laden to escape, officials acknowledge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORA BORA, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>As bombs rumbled in the dizzying mountains that ribbon the
Pakistani border, anti-Taliban commander Haji Mohammed Zaman paced
impatiently.</LD>
<LD>   On that hard, wintry December day, Zaman's troops were hunting for the
world's most wanted man--and they weren't having much luck. Day after day
they captured, then lost, the same ground. His soldiers were shivering,
hungry and losing their zeal. Zaman was frustrated.</LD>
<LD>   "If America wants to capture Osama, why aren't they trying?" he
complained.</LD>
<TE>   According to the commander's intelligence, Osama bin Laden was
hunkered down in the mountains, waiting out the airstrikes in deep
underground caverns. For weeks, Zaman had pressed the United States for
more weapons, supplies and money to hunt the Al Qaeda chief, but
Americans regarded the Afghan commander's information with suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   Now, months later, interrogation of captured Al Qaeda fighters has
reportedly led the Bush administration to conclude that Bin Laden was,
indeed, hiding out in the mountain redoubt. He might have escaped by
slipping over the border into wild tribal zones of Pakistan--just as
anti-Taliban commanders warned.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, some U.S. officials have lamented the decision to fight
the battle of Tora Bora with bombs and Afghan foot soldiers instead of
sending in U.S. ground troops.</TE>
<TE>   But during the siege, a Western diplomat in the region characterized
Zaman and other tribal warlords as "parasites" who were inflating reports
of Al Qaeda's presence in hopes of milking money and supplies from the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   If the United States was hesitant to trust the Afghan commanders, it
wasn't for nothing. It was impossible to say what invisible laces of
sympathy ran between the Afghans and their Al Qaeda foes. There was the
bond of Islam. In candid moments, most of the anti-Taliban soldiers
admitted that they'd rather see the terrorists flee than have to
slaughter them.</TE>
<TE>   Then there were mercenary motivations: Some Afghans reportedly ferried
desperate, wealthy terrorists to the Pakistani line for a pretty price.</TE>
<TE>   In a climate of mistrust and uncertainty--and daunted by a forbidding
terrain--the U.S. military balked at sending troops.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon stands by that decision. Last week, Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld said the United States couldn't be sure of Bin Laden's
whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   In the swirl of second-guessing, some military officials say the
Afghans fumbled, or even helped the terrorist chieftain evade capture.
But as the battle unfolded, local warriors repeatedly warned of Al Qaeda
members' probable--even imminent--escape.</TE>
<TE>   A gap in strategies was obvious from the beginning: Instead of sending
ground troops, U.S. warplanes flew overhead and dropped "daisy cutter"
bombs and cruise missiles. The United States set a $25-million bounty on
Bin Laden's head in hopes of appealing to local mercenaries.</TE>
<TE>   Afghans were skeptical. Bombs alone would never be enough to destroy
the network of caves, they said. After all, they pointed out, Soviet
forces spent years attacking Tora Bora, to little effect. The caves could
be attacked and searched only on foot, they warned, and the sooner the
better. As for the bounty, the men shrugged it off. Even if they bagged
the famed fugitive, they didn't expect to see a single cent.</TE>
<TE>   "That money is for our commanders," said a soldier named Rohullah.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghans pleaded for guns, food, coats and money. If they were
properly outfitted, they said, they could storm Tora Bora and rout Bin
Laden.</TE>
<TE>   But as the weeks passed, as biting winter brought the first snow
clouds--and as U.S. hesitation to send ground troops to the region became
apparent--local commanders spoke with impatience and, finally,
bewilderment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the United States wants to capture Osama," Mohammed
Alem, a top aide to Zaman, said in late November. "We know where he is,
we tell them and they do nothing. So they are not as serious as they say
they are."</TE>
<TE>   When the Northern Alliance stormed into the capital, Kabul, on Nov.
13, provincial Taliban governments dissolved throughout eastern
Afghanistan, and Zaman came riding over the Khyber Pass from Pakistan.
Guarded by a young, ragged army, he returned to his family's stone house
in Jalalabad and went to work plotting the ouster of "Arabs" who he
insisted were hiding in the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Zaman told anybody who would listen that Bin Laden had moved a few
hours south to Tora Bora. He told the tale of a long convoy of Al Qaeda
pickup trucks that rumbled out of the city and crept up into the hills.
Accompanied by a tribal elder from the Pakistani region of Parachinar,
Bin Laden had headed for Tora Bora, Zaman said. Villagers had watched him
pass.</TE>
<TE>   "You know the infrastructure of Al Qaeda has broken down completely,"
Zaman said in November. "If the allies help us, we can get them out of
Tora Bora."</TE>
<TE>   Hazrat Ali, the newly appointed security chief for the eastern
provinces, was equally certain. "I know who is sending lunch and dinner
from this city to Osama," he said one afternoon in November. He refused
to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Afghans said Bin Laden was accompanied by one of his sons and by Ayman
Zawahiri, the Egyptian doctor who looks after Bin Laden's health and is
also considered his most important advisor. They said the group included
hundreds, even thousands, of hard-line followers from China, Chechnya,
Kashmir and the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The first week of December, the anti-Taliban moujahedeen clambered to
a rocky plateau on the northern edge of Tora Bora. Far below, a dry
riverbed lay like a spine on the drought-baked earth; abandoned terraces
climbed the hillsides. The soldiers whistled, clapped and shouted; they
were glad to start the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   But even in the first flush of battle, there was skepticism in the
ranks. Commanders complained that their soldiers were being killed in
misguided air attacks and that incessant bombing made it difficult to
penetrate Al Qaeda hide-outs on foot.</TE>
<TE>   A soldier named Yar Mohammed squinted into the hills, a rocket
launcher slung over one shoulder. "These whole mountains are covered with
caves, and across the mountain," he pointed, "is Pakistan. They could
escape that way."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the roads to Pakistan had been sealed already by snow was an
open question in the early days of the assault. At first, commanders
claimed that Al Qaeda forces were cornered. But quietly, underlings
contradicted them.</TE>
<TE>   "We see they're escaping, but it's difficult to go forward in the
hills," Shorab Khan said. "Yeah, it's possible they can run away. We've
blocked the roads as best we can."</TE>
<TE>   It was an important point: South of Tora Bora lay the tribal areas of
Pakistan, where lawlessness ruled and Bin Laden enjoyed strong support.
Commanders said the path through the mountains had already been trodden
by fleeing Taliban leaders, including the chief of Nangarhar province,
who'd reportedly taken shelter in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, it became clear that it was possible--even easy--to tramp
through the snowdrifts into Pakistan. Around Dec. 7, the soldiers
overheard Bin Laden on the radio. He was still in Tora Bora, but "they
were getting ready to move," said Haji Zahir, another senior Afghan
commander.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, tribal scouts said they saw Bin Laden picking his
way over the hills on horseback. The Saudi exile was flanked by four Al
Qaeda guards, commander Haji Khalan Mir said.</TE>
<TE>   The days slipped past. The Afghans said they caught sight of Bin
Laden, lost him, then found him again. In a shadow dance of rumors and
overheard radio transmissions, Bin Laden became an almost mystical
figure: moving, moving, always moving. But this had always been the
terrorist chief's way.</TE>
<TE>   One day, Zaman's scouts spotted blood in the snow on the route to the
Pakistani border. The commander's conclusion was ominous: Al Qaeda
fighters were escaping.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Zaman and Ali--who seldom agreed on anything--spoke with
renewed conviction of Bin Laden's presence. Both refused to explain what
made them so suddenly, unwaveringly certain.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 100% sure Osama is here," Zaman said. "I send spies every day.
They bring me the information." He paused, then gave a curt warning: "If
America continues like this, it's a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   At the height of combat, about 100 members of the U.S. and British
special forces were stationed in Tora Bora. Otherwise, the U.S. kept an
eye on the battle from the distant vantage of Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan soldiers starved, shivered and wrapped their wounds in
blankets because there were no medicines, bandages or doctors. They
pressed toward the caves on the outskirts of the cave complex, only to be
pushed back again. Foot soldiers seesawed over the same ground day after
day, sniping and ducking along the rocky trails.</TE>
<TE>   At night, when temperatures plunged and the hunger pangs were sharp,
the soldiers--many barely beyond adolescence--climbed down from their
posts and sought shelter in the mud houses of nearby farmers. One night,
they raided a network television truck and devoured the crew's food.</TE>
<TE>   "We were hungry," they said with a shrug the next day.</TE>
<TE>   When morning broke, they battled their way back to the positions
they'd abandoned the night before. "If we had coats or shoes, we could go
ahead," said Sarbaz Khan, who headed an Afghan squadron. "It's so cold at
night we can't hold our guns. Our blood freezes; it gets so we can't move
easily."</TE>
<TE>   The Afghans had been holding walkie-talkie negotiations with Al Qaeda
fighters since the attacks began. Then, on Dec. 11, a core group of Al
Qaeda fighters promised to turn themselves in at daybreak.</TE>
<TE>   But when the appointed hour arrived, the eerie silence of the
cease-fire was broken by a torrent of bombs from U.S. warplanes. Gunfire
cracked against the rocks.</TE>
<TE>   "American bombing disturbed the negotiations," griped a commander
named Ali Mohammed. "The Americans ruined everything."</TE>
<TE>   Other Afghans were wary: The negotiations were nothing but a trick,
they said, a way to buy time.</TE>
<TE>   "Hundreds have already escaped," said Mir, the commander under
security chief Ali. "And we are sure Osama bin Laden escaped through this
road to the Pakistani tribal areas."</TE>

<HD>Victim of Mob Justice Is Laid to Rest</HD>
<DH>Conflict: As vigilantism spikes, relatives deny that a West Bank
man was an informant for Israel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JIFNA, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>They buried Ibrahim Abdou in a small concrete tomb in a field of
red poppies and pine trees. Blood smeared his face, and olive branches
lined his coffin.</LD>
<LD>   He was single, one of seven brothers who grew up in this ancient
Christian community a few miles north of Ramallah.</LD>
<LD>   He was a man whom rumor held to be a collaborator, a Palestinian who
helped the Israeli army during its recent invasion of the West Bank. And
for that, he died a brutal death.</LD>
<TE>   "I hope my brother will at least be buried in peace to make up for the
pain he suffered when he died," older brother Yacoub said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Abdou, 24, was killed by an angry mob of Palestinians on Monday in
Ramallah. The death came just a few days after the Israeli army pulled
back from most of the West Bank city, which was devastated by three weeks
of fighting, its police force destroyed and its justice system now
nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   The killing of suspected informants has long been a divisive issue in
the Palestinian territories. The Israeli security apparatus is famous for
its network of spies, bought with money or promises of work permits.
Sometimes it resorts to blackmail, promising to vacate a prison term or
stop the arrest of a loved one.</TE>
<TE>   But as Palestinians begin rebuilding after the Israeli invasion, there
are growing fears about a surge of vigilante justice. Since the Israeli
army pulled back last week, five Palestinians have been killed by mobs.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent attack occurred Tuesday, when three men were dragged
from their beds in the West Bank city of Hebron and shot to death. One of
the bodies was strung up on a utility pole as children watched.</TE>
<TE>   There is precedent for such incidents: The estimated 2,000
Palestinians killed between 1987 and 1993 during the first uprising
against Israeli rule included about 900 who were slain by fellow
Palestinians. And mob justice increased again after the current intifada
began in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But many Palestinians fear that the bloodletting might become much
worse now. It will take weeks, if not months, to begin rebuilding the
Palestinian Authority's shattered police force.</TE>
<TE>   "Now everyone who has something against someone else will be able to
accuse them and kill them," Alexandra Odeh, 60, said at Abdou's funeral.
"This is chaos."</TE>
<TE>   The events leading to Abdou's killing began Monday morning, when he
decided to look for work in Ramallah after the Israeli military had
pulled back. His father, 55-year-old Yusef, begged him not to go.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still uncertain what is going on," he told his son. "You must be
careful."</TE>
<TE>   About 1:30 that afternoon, Abdou and two other men were riding in a
taxi in a trash-filled square in downtown Ramallah. Suddenly, a band of
men wearing masks pulled them from the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   As taxis blared their horns and onlookers cheered, the masked men
pumped round after round of bullets into the legs of the three men. They
writhed on the ground and pleaded for mercy. One man reportedly recited
verses from the Koran traditionally used for those at the point of death.</TE>
<TE>   Ambulance crews managed to rescue two of the men, who remained in the
central hospital Wednesday. But Abdou was dragged for several blocks
along the street, bleeding to death.</TE>
<TE>   The masked men, who fled in a car, shouted that they were from the Al
Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an offshoot of Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement that has been responsible for many suicide
bombings and other attacks against Israelis in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear what tagged Abdou as an informant. Witnesses said the
masked men accused him of helping in the capture of Marwan Barghouti, a
Fatah leader seized by the Israelis last week.</TE>
<TE>   Abdou's family denied that but acknowledged that he once worked for a
branch of the Palestinian intelligence service. He tried to quit but was
once arrested by the Palestinians and held for what one of his brothers
termed "misbehavior."</TE>
<TE>   The family's version is that the other two men attacked on Tuesday had
been jailed by the Palestinians, accused of having worked as
collaborators, when the Israelis invaded last month and freed them. Abdou
might have known the men from his time in the intelligence service.</TE>
<TE>   Family members made no mention of a taxi. They said that as the two
men were being attacked, they saw Abdou and called out his name, leading
the mob to turn on Abdou as well.</TE>
<TE>   On the wall of the family's squat stone home just off the main road
through Jifna, a notice proclaimed that the men were victims of "personal
differences" with the masked men. It was signed by a previously
unheard-of group called the Islamic Army, Osama bin Laden Brigade.</TE>
<TE>   Although the truth might never be known, the Abdou family's version is
given credence by the fact that most vigilante executions are accompanied
by a signed statement to the media from a group taking responsibility for
the act, something that didn't occur in this case.</TE>
<TE>   "My brother was clean," Yacoub Abdou said. "They had nothing against
him."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case, the terrible repercussions of having an accused
collaborator in the family were evident Wednesday as Yacoub Abdou went
through the long and painful process of burying his brother.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived at the hospital just before noon and was taken to the
morgue behind the building. He began sobbing as a nurse dragged his
sibling's body from a cooler, the hands and feet bound in white cloth, a
white rag tied around the jaw. She used a cotton ball to close the
wide-open eyes and mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Locals were scared to be seen talking with a reporter who was present,
and several young boys whispered and frowned as Yacoub Abdou loaded his
brother's body into the back of a black hearse.</TE>
<TE>   It took nearly half an hour across roads torn up by Israeli tanks to
make the trip back to Jifna, a biblical-era town with a few hundred
Christian Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, the entire population of such a small village shows up for a
funeral. But this time, only about 100 family members and friends were
waiting when the body arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Norma Abdou began sobbing when people carried her son's coffin into
the family's living room and removed the lid. She kissed Ibrahim's face,
saying over and over, "My son, my son."</TE>
<TE>   As rows of men stood outside, the women crowded into the living room.
The mother put a cigarette in Ibrahim's mouth. "It's our tradition," a
man said. Norma Abdou placed a favorite Nike cap on her son's head, then
took it off and put it on her own head before collapsing.</TE>
<TE>   As the funeral procession later made its way through the town, there
were yet more signs of disrespect. By custom, merchants are supposed to
close up shop when a funeral passes. But several did not, leading to a
clash between the family and a drugstore owner.</TE>
<TE>   Yacoub Abdou said family members are worried about what might happen
to them, but he vowed not to seek revenge.</TE>
<TE>   The family held a short service in the town's ancient Greek Orthodox
church. Incense filled the air. The men sang a low, mournful chant.
Family members came up one by one to kiss Ibrahim three times on his
forehead.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the mourners lifted the coffin and made their way to the tiny
walled cemetery beside the church.</TE>
<TE>   They slid the body into an above-ground family tomb, then a worker
sealed it with cement. A chill wind blew, and the sky was overcast.</TE>
<TE>   The crypt's black door closed with a thud.</TE>

<HD>Bush, Saudi Prince Meet Today for Blunt Talk on Mideast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush hosts Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah at his
Texas ranch today for what U.S. and Arab officials say are expected to be
blunt and occasionally difficult talks on the Middle East crisis, the war
on terrorism and relations with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Because of growing economic and security ties, the U.S.-Saudi
relationship has never been more important to either side, according to
U.S. analysts. But the topics of today's meeting also reflect the wide
gap between the United States, the world's most powerful secular
democracy, and the oil-rich desert kingdom, which is ruled by strict
Islamic law.</LD>
<LD>   Abdullah plans to stress to Bush that the U.S. needs to do more--with
urgency--to deal with the "very deep crisis that is engulfing our
region," Prince Saud al Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, told The
Times on Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The crown prince, who in effect has been the ruler of the kingdom
since King Fahd suffered a stroke in 1995, will warn the Bush
administration that its very reputation is being questioned in the region
because the U.S. president's April 4 call for Israel to completely
withdraw from reoccupied Palestinian territory in the West Bank has been
ignored, Saudi sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah, who sponsored an Arab League offer of normal relations with
Israel in return for Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied during
the 1967 Middle East War, also will make clear his country's opposition
to any international peace conference that does not include Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat as well as Syria and Lebanon, the two
Arab countries bordering Israel that have not made peace with the Jewish
state. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon recently proposed a conference
but stipulated that Arafat be excluded, an idea that Saud described as
"ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration had encouraged the Saudis to promote the
land-for-peace formula at the Arab League summit last month, and a senior
administration official said Wednesday that its unanimous passage had
"opened a new portal through which you might pursue peace."</TE>
<TE>   The crown prince, who met Wednesday evening with Vice President Dick
Cheney in Houston, will press the president to help free Arafat, who has
been confined by Israeli troops to the West Bank city of Ramallah since
December.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon always says he cannot negotiate with a gun pointed to his
head. Why should he expect the other side to negotiate with a gun pointed
at its head?" Saud asked in an interview on CNN. "There has to be freedom
of movement for Arafat."</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia also has taken a firm stand against a military operation
to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The Saudi foreign minister called
for Hussein to be given "the benefit of the doubt" for now to follow
through on steps he pledged at the Arab League summit to take to comply
with U.N. resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudis expect candor--and results--from the meeting with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "These are two leaders who believe in honesty, and they believe that
friends tell friends the truth," Saud told The Times, referring to Bush
and Abdullah. "So I expect the discussions to be frank, to be deep and
also with a sense of commitment that if they come to a common
understanding of what the situation is, then they will come to a common
understanding what needs to be done about it."</TE>
<TE>   A State Department official put it more bluntly. "They're going to
hammer us," he said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will in turn push the Saudis to pressure Arafat to rein in the
violence. He will also urge them to cut off funds to Palestinian
extremist groups, provide more help in the war on terrorism and support a
plan to oust Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is particularly concerned about Saudi funding, some of it
from wealthy individuals, to extremist groups.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely clear that private Saudi money has played a role. To
what extent it is official money or private funds is unclear," the State
Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said in Senate testimony Wednesday
that some of the $100 million collected during a recent Saudi telethon
for Palestinian reconstruction may have gone to Hamas, one of two Islamic
extremist groups behind the recent suicide bombings against Israelis.
"There are troubling aspects as to how that telethon money would be
distributed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia denies the charges.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be happy to talk to them about the money," Saud said. "We are
very clear that our aid goes only to the national [Palestinian]
Authority. The United States knows this. The laws of Saudi Arabia assure
that there is no aid going to any other organization."</TE>
<TE>   On both economic and security matters, the U.S.-Saudi relationship has
grown substantially over the last quarter-century. The U.S. is the
largest buyer of Saudi oil--about 1.7 million barrels a day, more than
twice the consumption 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The kingdom is the largest purchaser of American weapons, buying $39
billion of U.S. arms in the 1990s. Saudi Arabia is also a major investor
in the U.S. economy.Last year, trade reached almost $20 billion,
according to U.S. figures.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S.-Saudi relationship is also one of the most fragile. Last
summer, Abdullah sent a letter to Bush warning that ties were "at a
crossroads," a move sparked by U.S. lack of action on the Mideast peace
process and support for Sharon. Relations were further strained by the
Sept. 11 attacks, because 15 of the 19 suspected hijackers were Saudis.</TE>

<HD>U.N. and Israelis Meeting to Discuss Jenin Investigation</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Sharon's defense minister says the panel's aim is to put
his nation 'on trial.' Annan expects the team to start in the West Bank
this weekend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>United Nations officials will meet here today with an Israeli
delegation to discuss its objections to a U.N. investigation of the
recent battle at a West Bank refugee camp, a spokesman for the world body
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   However, Secretary-General Kofi Annan still expects the team
investigating the Israeli attack on the Jenin camp to begin work in the
West Bank this weekend, spokesman Fred Eckhard said.</LD>
<LD>   Annan was backed by the Security Council, which issued a unanimous
statement saying it fully supported his efforts and expected "the full
cooperation of Israel with the secretary-general and with the
fact-finding team."</LD>
<TE>   The Jenin camp was heavily damaged in fighting between Israeli forces
and Palestinian gunmen this month. Palestinians claim that hundreds of
civilians were killed in the camp; Israeli officials say there were no
more than 100 Palestinian deaths and that most of those slain were
fighters. Twenty-three Israeli soldiers were killed in the operation.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. mission was endorsed by a Security Council resolution Friday
after Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told Annan that Israel would
welcome a U.N. inquiry into the events at Jenin. But Israelis have since
demanded that the mission be postponed or canceled, objecting to the
makeup of the investigating team.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials assert that the group, which is headed by former
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, is dominated by Europeans with an
anti-Israeli bias and lacks the military expertise to evaluate the army's
occupation of the camp. The investigators held their first organizational
meeting in Geneva on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a team looking into fighting in a residential area," Arye
Mekel, an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Wednesday in
Jerusalem. "It needs military experts, not only politicians."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Cabinet members also demanded that the U.N. investigate
Palestinian suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting with the secretary-general here Tuesday, Israel's
ambassador to the U.N. pressed for "clarification on the team's
composition and scope of action, as well as other issues," Eckhard said.</TE>
<TE>   Annan told Ambassador Yehuda Lancry that mission leaders may recruit
additional experts in counter-terrorism or other areas, but he refused to
discuss the people he had appointed to the group, the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Annan "feels it was his team to name; he feels that the Israelis
indicated to him in advance that they would cooperate with whatever team
he named, and those are his people, and that's the end of the
discussion," Eckhard said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Ahtisaari, the mission will include Sadako Ogata, a
former U.N. high commissioner for refugees, and Cornelio Sommaruga, a
onetime director of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Retired
U.S. Army Maj. Gen. William L. Nash is the group's military advisor, with
Peter Fitzgerald, a former Irish police commissioner, serving as an
expert on security issues. Experts in forensics and international
humanitarian law also are advising the group.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Wednesday that his
government rescinded its agreement for the mission after it "realized
that the whole trend, to put it gently, was how to entrap Israel so it
could be put on trial."</TE>
<TE>   Israel Television reported that the government may "delegitimize" the
U.N. team if its demands aren't met, refusing to cooperate and blocking
access to the camp.</TE>
<TE>   As the diplomatic wrangling over the Jenin mission continued, so did
the West Bank standoffs at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity and in the
Ramallah headquarters of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis and Palestinians negotiated over the fate of gunmen holed up
inside the 4th century church, the site where tradition holds that Jesus
was born, even as violence flared outside the hall where they met. An
Israeli sniper shot a Palestinian who stood at a window inside the
church. The army said the man was armed. The Palestinian was evacuated to
an Israeli hospital, where he died.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday afternoon, gunfire erupted around the church. Palestinians
said three men inside were hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, two Palestinians surrendered to Israeli soldiers after
walking out of the church with their hands up and saying they were ill.</TE>
<TE>   Early this morning, the Israeli army said the Palestinian gunmen
inside agreed to let a group of youths leave the church, perhaps as early
as today.</TE>
<TE>   In other violence Wednesday, three Palestinians were killed inthe
Jabaliya refugee camp, in the Gaza Strip, in an explosion that
Palestinian sources said was believed to have occurred during work on a
bomb.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, Israeli soldiers stepped up raids on villages.
Palestinians said a Fatah leader was gunned down in a raid on the village
of Bani Naim, near Hebron, along with an unidentified man.</TE>
<TE>   Three 14-year-old Palestinians who were crawling toward the perimeter
fence of Netzarim, a Jewish settlement in Gaza, were shot and killed
Tuesday night by Israeli troops.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, an Israeli army unit said it shot five Palestinian police
officers to death in a car near Hebron. The unit had come under fire from
the car, the army said. Earlier, witnesses said, a Palestinian was killed
and at least four were wounded when Israeli tanks briefly entered Hebron.</TE>

<HD>Tape Captures Chavez Calling for Troops</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MARACAY, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>President Hugo Chavez ordered troops and tanks into Caracas'
streets April 11 to confront a massive opposition demonstration that
ended in bloodshed, according to an audiotape released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The violence in the Venezuelan capital led disgusted generals to oust
Chavez on April 12. Loyalist troops and thousands of Chavez militants
rebelled April 13, and Chavez was restored to power on April 14.</LD>
<LD>   In the tape, released by the Venezuelan media, Chavez is heard
ordering the activation of "Plan Avila," a state security emergency plan,
to contain about 200,000 civilians who marched on the presidential palace
to demand that he resign.</LD>
<TE>   "I order you to start Plan Avila. The first move we must make is to
send the Ayala Battalion," Chavez tells an unidentified officer via
radio.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuelan generals have said they refused to obey the order requiring
them to use force against unarmed civilians. Nevertheless, 15 people died
that day, and several investigations are underway to determine who is to
blame.</TE>
<TE>   A broadcast journalist, Marianela Salazar, initially released the tape
but declined to say how she obtained it. The tape was widely reported by
news media Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Rojas, a presidential spokesman, refused to comment on the tape
but said it was "a communication between the Defense Ministry and the
president."</TE>
<TE>   Venezuelan generals didn't deny the tape's authenticity at a ceremony
Wednesday in the central city of Maracay, where most of Venezuela's armed
forces are concentrated.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Lucas Romero Rincon, Venezuela's top officer, defended Chavez's
order, saying Plan Avila "isn't to mistreat and repress the population.
No, it's to guarantee security."</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Luis Camacho, former vice security minister and one of the
officers who rebelled against Chavez, said Wednesday that he had refused
to obey the president's order.</TE>
<TE>   "The pure presence of the police and National Guard would have
resolved" security problems posed by the demonstration, Camacho said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate comment from Chavez's office.</TE>

<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>Former Yugoslav army chief Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic will turn himself
in to the U.N. tribunal in The Hague today to answer charges of war
crimes in Kosovo in 1999, his lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   Vojislav Selezan said Wednesday that his client, who served under
ousted Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, was booked on the morning
flight to the Netherlands, as the first of six suspects who have decided
to report to the tribunal voluntarily.</LD>
<LD>   Under intense financial pressure from the United States, Yugoslavia
passed a law April 11 outlining procedures for the hand-over of suspects
to the United Nations war crimes tribunal.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. State Department said Tuesday that it wanted to see those
indicted by the tribunal travel to The Hague before it released financial
aid. A list of 23 indictees was published by the government last week,
six of whom said they would surrender.</TE>

<DL>BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan
</DL>
<LD>Three astronauts, including fee-paying South African Internet
millionaire Mark Shuttleworth, blasted off today in a Russian rocket for
an eight-day trip to the International Space Station.</LD>
<LD>   Shuttleworth, 28, is the second amateur to pay his way into space
after California businessman Dennis Tito visited the International Space
Station a year ago. He is the first African citizen to go into space.</LD>
<LD>   Crammed into the cockpit by his side were Russian cosmonaut Yuri
Gidzenko and Roberto Vittori, an Italian.</LD>
<TE>   The Soyuz rocket lifted off at 12:26 p.m. Kazakhstan time from Launch
Pad One, the same site from which the world's first cosmonaut, Yuri
Gagarin, blasted off 41 years ago. The crew was to spend eight days at
the space station before landing back on the Kazakhstan steppe May 5.</TE>
<TE>   After medical tests and technical preparations Wednesday, the
astronauts watched the classic 1970s Soviet blockbuster "The Scorching
Sun of the Desert," a decades-old tradition faithfully followed by every
crew leaving the Baikonur cosmodrome, which Russia rents from Kazakhstan.
The price of the trip has not been officially disclosed, but Russia media
have reported that Shuttleworth paid up to $20 million for his seat on
the Soyuz.</TE>
<TE>   "We received our final ballistic and trajectory information, and we
have been working closely with the doctors, who have been keeping a beady
eye on us," Shuttleworth said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Shuttleworth is the second amateur space buff to buy a reported
$20-million ticket to the ISS, but his eight-month training stint at Star
City outside Moscow suffered little of the U.S.-Russian controversy that
surrounded Tito's flight.</TE>
<TE>   NASA feared that Tito might endanger himself and the ISS. Russia's
space agency accused NASA of stalling preparations because it objected to
cash-paying amateurs visiting the space outpost.</TE>
<TE>   Vittori, 37, a European Space Agency astronaut who will serve as the
crew's flight engineer, also will be on his maiden flight.</TE>
<TE>   Gidzenko, 40, who will captain the flight, was one of the three-member
crew that blazed the ISS trail in October 2000.</TE>

<LD>Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern announced that he was dissolving
parliament ahead of a general election expected to be held May 17, his
spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Recent polls have given Ahern's Fianna Fail party, the senior
coalition partner in the longest-serving peacetime government in the
republic's history, a strong lead over its main rival, the center-left
Fine Gael.</LD>
<LD>   Ahern said he thought voters would look back on the five years of his
administration as a "golden period" for Ireland.</LD>
<TE>   He said his party delivered on promises to cut taxes, create jobs and
bring peace--a reference to the Northern Ireland peace process. But the
opposition is likely to hammer on crime and corruption.</TE>

<LD>A British court dismissed the last remaining charges against Lotfi
Raissi, a British-based Algerian pilot originally accused by the U.S. of
training the Sept. 11 hijackers.</LD>
<LD>   Raissi was released on bail from a jail in February after a judge
ruled that allegations that he had been involved in the attacks were
unsubstantiated. He appeared in court Wednesday on charges of falsifying
his application for a U.S. pilot's license.</LD>
<LD>   "Several allegations involving terrorism have been made, but . . . I
have received no evidence to support that contention," Judge Timothy
Workman said, throwing out all the charges.</LD>

<DH>Weather: There's no relief in sight from six years of drought.
Meanwhile, a wildfire in Colorado has grown to 2,100 acres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALAMOSA, Colo.
</DL>
<LD>A severe water shortage brought on by yet another dry
winter--coupled with the premature onset of summer--threatens to
devastate the Rocky Mountain states. Conditions are so bad so early in
the year, that officials fear the extended drought will debilitate the
region's economic powerhouses: agriculture, livestock and recreation.</LD>
<LD>   And, forecasters warn, the tinder-dry forests could make this the
worst wildfire season ever. This week, on the same day that Colorado Gov.
Bill Owens announced a drought emergency and released $500,000 to fight
fires, a major blaze broke out in the mountain town of Bailey, south of
Denver. The fire grew to 2,100 acres Wednesday, forcing hundreds of
residents to evacuate. About 1,000 homes and a dozen businesses were
threatened.</LD>
<LD>   Crews stood ready to defend downtown buildings as about 200
firefighters battled the blaze, with more fire crews being flown in today
from the Northwest.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got a serious situation here, and we're really working hard,"
fire information officer Terry McCann said. He said cooler weather and
higher humidity Wednesday night had calmed the fire some, but said the
situation remained dangerous. Some residents were allowed to return home
late in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado is not alone in its problems. This month governors in
Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Arizona declared drought emergencies and
requested a similar designation from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The federal action would allow farmers and ranchers to receive
low-interest loans to pay bills.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about as dry as it can get here," said rancher George Whitten of
the San Luis Valley, near the New Mexico line in the south-central part
of the state. The area receives a mere 6 to 7 inches of moisture a year,
including snowfall.</TE>
<TE>   "People talk about how bad it is compared to the norm, but it seems to
me like drought is the norm," Whitten said.</TE>
<TE>   While a dry spring in the East has driven lake levels in some areas to
record lows and brought national attention, most of the states in this
region have endured worse conditions for as long as six years.</TE>
<TE>   If dry conditions persist along the Eastern Seaboard's urban corridor,
more households will likely be affected by water rationing than the
sparsely populated West. But the economic implications of the Western
drought are more far-reaching--it could result in higher food costs, the
loss of tourism dollars and astronomical bills from fighting wildfires
near housing subdivisions.</TE>
<TE>   The Rocky Mountain snowpack has been at its lowest levels in decades,
at 12% of normal in some areas. Now it's gone. Even at altitudes above
11,000 feet the snow has already melted, weeks ahead of schedule. And,
instead of engorging streams and rivers, the water absorbed into the
desiccated soil before reaching the waterways.</TE>
<TE>   Water from melted snow is vital to fast-growing communities
downstream. Water levels in rivers and streams support fish and wildlife,
as well as recreational activities such as boating. Water flowing into
reservoirs such as Roosevelt Dam in Arizona is a source of inexpensive
hydroelectric power.</TE>
<TE>   Snow melt is also essential to recharge the wells and springs used by
farmers and cattle growers throughout the West.</TE>
<TE>   Here in the San Luis Valley, producer of most of Colorado's meat and
vegetables, flow in the Rio Grande River has been below normal for 10 of
the last 14 years. The situation has led to dire predictions for the
health of the valley's $500-million agricultural economy.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, in the face of it all, locals can indulge in gallows humor.
Ask state water engineer Steve Vandiver what it will take to reverse the
dry trend in southern Colorado and this is the answer: "There's a
situation mentioned in the Bible that will take care of it: Rain for 40
days and 40 nights."</TE>
<TE>   The problem can be clearly seen from the kitchen of Whitten's ranch
house near Saguache Creek, north of Alamosa. The spectacular view is of
the Sangre de Cristo range, source of the headwaters of the Rio Grande.
The rugged peaks ought to be covered with snow to the tree line. Instead,
the mountains are an unbroken gray down to brown flatland.</TE>
<TE>   Whitten raises 400 head of cattle on 1,800 acres, helped by his wife,
Julie Sullivan, and their border collie, Chico. To the Whittens, the
drought is all about food for the cattle.</TE>
<TE>   Rainfall is needed to bring up the native grasses that cattle feed on
in the summer. Irrigation is necessary to grow the alfalfa or hay now
that gets the cattle through the winter. Without water to grow his own
food, a rancher like Whitten has to buy commercial hay or feed at high
cost.</TE>
<TE>   Range conditions this summer may also mean that Western ranchers won't
be allowed to graze their cattle on public lands. Bureau of Land
Management supervisors in several states have already warned that unless
conditions improve, ranchers with grazing permits might be turned away.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some people here who will spend their life savings buying
feed for their cattle this summer," Vandiver said.</TE>
<TE>   Or they will sell cows, as Whitten says he will.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest cattle ranchers generally sell only calves, which are
fattened at feedlots elsewhere. Selling breed stock can be a sign of
financial desperation, akin to a fisherman selling his boat. Industry
observers predict the Western drought will ultimately drive up beef
prices by about 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Similar problems among farmers are responsible for the high price of
lettuce and potatoes. Likewise, Colorado's dreadful winter wheat crop
will be reflected in the increased cost of a loaf of bread.</TE>
<TE>   Among ranchers here, Whitten is fortunate. His land is blessed with
deep artesian wells. Most other ranchers in the valley rely on surface
water. According to local officials, even those holding surface-water
rights that date to the 19th century are not likely to get much flowing
through their irrigation ditches.</TE>
<TE>   "Water rights on paper and wet water are two different things," said
Whitten, whose rights from 1870 are not expected to get him any water.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers are in better shape, for now. Most farmers have wells. But
their thirsty crops need supplemental water. That means that valley
farmers are deciding in the next few weeks what, if any, crops they will
plant for the fall harvest.</TE>
<TE>   Should ground water remain at these low levels, farmers will face
worse times next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone has anything but apprehension right now," said
Ray Wright, a potato farmer. "Most of us will just plant less. You can't
afford to plant it and watch your crop dry up and blow away."</TE>
<TE>   At a somber meeting here Tuesday, farmers and ranchers met with local
water district managers. Spread out on a conference table, depressing
charts and graphs spelled out the problems facing the valley. Beneath the
table, dusty boots tapped the floor in frustration.</TE>
<TE>   In Alamosa, as in other Western communities, water woes end up being
everyone's problem. Farm equipment sales are down, causing the closing of
all but a few local salesrooms. Automobile dealers--accustomed to selling
multiple pickup trucks to ranchers--are sending salespeople home.</TE>
<TE>   Only a quarter-mile from the water meeting at the Bureau of
Reclamation building is the Rio Grande, a once-mighty river spawned in
the nearby mountain range. The river should be at its most powerful here,
near its source, then flowing to New Mexico and Texas, and, finally, into
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The view from a bridge is of standing pools and sandbars.</TE>

<HD>Ethanol Makes Strange Bedfellows in South Dakota</HD>
<DH>Politics: A trip to the Plains shows the complex relationship
between Bush and Democratic leader Tom Daschle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SIOUX FALLS, S.D.
</DL>
<LD>President Bush and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) are
like two feuding dance partners: They are doing their best to step on
each other's toes but not have anyone notice.</LD>
<LD>   They flew separately halfway across the country on Wednesday, their
destination an ethanol plant where together they could promote the
corn-based gasoline additive as a means to reduce the nation's reliance
on imported petroleum.</LD>
<LD>   Daschle then left the state. Bush stayed, speaking to political
audiences and giving South Dakotans every reason he could muster to vote
against Daschle's Democratic Senate colleague, Tim Johnson.</LD>
<TE>   Bush was campaigning for Rep. John R. Thune, the Republican whom the
president, during a private dinner last year, helped persuade to launch a
Senate run.</TE>
<TE>   The Johnson-Thune race is likely to be one of the closest, most
hard-fought in a year when Senate control could hinge on a single seat.</TE>
<TE>   That's the margin of the current Democratic majority in the Senate,
which means that sometimes Bush and Daschle must work together, as on the
ethanol issue.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush noted during their joint appearance Wednesday: "Tom and I have
spent some quality time together. I invite him to the Oval Office for
breakfast."</TE>
<TE>   But at other times, they want nothing more than to undermine each
other.</TE>
<TE>   At a Thune rally Wednesday night, Bush was blunt about his
preferences. "John Thune should be the next U.S. senator from South
Dakota," he told more than 5,000 people at the Sioux Falls Convention
Center. "I like his values. I respect his intellect. . . . He's not
afraid to stand up for what he believes and it's refreshing to hear his
voice among the shrill partisans in Washington, D.C."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush-Daschle relationship has been in the spotlight ever since the
South Dakotan was elevated to Senate majority leader last spring when
Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont bolted the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Bush made a point of cultivating
Daschle as an ally. Daschle's support was key to the president's ability
to respond to the attacks with united congressional support.</TE>
<TE>   Bush now holds nearly weekly breakfast meetings with Daschle and other
congressional leaders, as he mentioned Wednesday. And following his
speech to Congress shortly after the attacks, Bush greeted Daschle with a
bear hug--an embrace that became an emblem of the post-Sept. 11
moratorium on partisanship.</TE>
<TE>   But by the end of the year, Daschle had evolved from First Pal into
First Adversary, battling the administration on many issues.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans responded with a concerted effort to depict Daschle as the
personification of Democratic obstructionism, charging he used his power
to block Bush's proposed economic stimulus package, the president's
nominees for judicial appointments and other White House initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   GOP-allied advocacy groups also have aired a steady stream of
television ads in South Dakota criticizing Daschle--even though he is not
up for reelection until 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's supporters produced a television ad of their own in South
Dakota this week, welcoming Bush to the state but calling on him to tell
"out-of-state special interests" to stop the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the dueling ads, Daschle was in the front row as Bush spoke at
the Dakota Ethanol plant in Wentworth, S.D. Johnson, Thune and South
Dakota's Republican governor, William Janklow, also were in the front
row.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom, I'm honored you'd come," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Not mentioned was that Daschle's presence had been the subject of
awkward back-and-forth conversations between his office and the White
House. At one point Tuesday, Daschle said he would not make the trip
because he had been excluded from another event at which Bush and Thune
were to meet with farmers for a "round-table discussion."</TE>
<TE>   He eventually agreed to go to the speech after the White House
excluded Thune from the round-table.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Daschle have joined forces in backing a provision in the
energy bill now that would significantly increase the amount of ethanol
added to gasoline to help reduce pollution. On Tuesday, Daschle helped
defeat a bid to delete the provision--an effort led by Democratic
senators from California and New York who fear the ethanol requirement
would dramatically hike the price of auto fuel in their states.</TE>
<TE>   "I said when I was running for president I supported ethanol, and I
meant it," Bush said Wednesday. "I support it now, because not only do I
know it's important for the [agricultural] sector of our economy, it's an
important part of making sure we become less reliant on foreign sources
of energy."</TE>
<TE>   After the speech, Bush stepped down from his stage, sought out Daschle
and gave him a handshake and pat on the back.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he'd kiss me, but people would talk," Daschle said moments
later.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate majority leader added: "It's always great to have the
president of the United States talk about agriculture, talk about
ethanol."</TE>
<TE>   That's policy.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the politics.</TE>
<TE>   As Daschle returned to Washington to push the Democratic agenda, Bush
focused his attention on trying to put him back in the Senate minority.
He was the main attraction at a Thune fund-raiser--which White House
Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said would garner $350,000, the most
collected at a single event in South Dakota history--and then the Thune
rally.</TE>

<HD>House OKs Accounting Reforms</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Bill to toughen corporate oversight is criticized by
Senate Democrats, who say it's not strict enough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In the strongest congressional response yet to Enron Corp.'s
collapse, the Republican-led House passed a bill Wednesday that would
give investors a fuller and more accurate picture of a company's
finances, especially from outside auditors.</LD>
<LD>   But Democrats who control the Senate contended the House bill doesn't
go far enough, setting up an election-year fight that could hinder
chances of far-reaching reforms.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, approved after months of hearings on Enron's descent into
bankruptcy and the role in its fall played by its indicted auditor,
Arthur Andersen, would create a new accounting oversight board and impose
new financial disclosure requirements on publicly traded companies.</LD>
<TE>   "We need to encourage greater corporate responsibility," said Rep.
Michael Oxley (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Financial Services
Committee and one of the bill's authors. "We need to strengthen and
modernize accounting oversight. We need to make sure that investors have
timely and clear information."</TE>
<TE>   The 334-90 vote in support of the measure underscored the bipartisan
resolve to deal with the economic and political consequences of Enron's
meltdown. But an earlier, largely party-line vote of 219-202 against a
tougher Democratic measure signaled the difficulties that may thwart
compromise on a final bill.</TE>
<TE>   Influential Senate Democrats have proposed stronger measures, such as
restricting accounting firms from providing most consulting services for
audit clients to prevent conflicts of interest. The House bill would
prohibit only some types of consulting.</TE>
<TE>   Like the House bill, Senate proposals call for creating a new watchdog
panel for accountants. But there is disagreement over the panel's makeup
and whether Congress or the Securities and Exchange Commission should
determine its powers.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate also is considering a broader package of reforms, including
new protections for corporate whistle-blowers and stiffer penalties for
document shredding.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush praised the House for its "reasonable approach" to
providing better information to investors, making corporate officers more
accountable and developing a more independent audit system.</TE>
<TE>Prospects for Agreement Uncertain</TE>
<TE>   The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, an industry
trade group, said the bill includes "unprecedented and rigorous reforms"
in the discipline and oversight of the accounting profession.</TE>
<TE>   But experts disagree over the prospects for House and Senate
cooperation on reform legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't expect that Congress will ultimately agree on anything before
the November elections," said Patrick Basham, senior fellow at the Cato
Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republicans feel politically compelled to do something, anything,
to keep any Enron-related fallout away from their candidates, but many
GOP congressmen are instinctively suspicious of government overreach in
this area and, therefore, will be satisfied with having rhetorically
demonstrated their concern," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert E. Litan, economic studies director for the Brookings
Institution in Washington, said, "There is a good chance that the
Senate-passed bill will be a bit tougher on the accounting profession
than the House bill, but what happens in conference [negotiations] is
anyone's guess. What isn't too difficult to guess, however, is that the
president almost surely will sign any accounting reform bill that
Congress puts on his desk."</TE>
<TE>   The bill is the second one approved by the House in response to the
accounting irregularities at Enron that led to the largest corporate
bankruptcy filing in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   This month the House approved a measure to give employees new rights
to sell company stock and diversify investments in their 401(k)
retirement accounts. Enron employees lost as much as $1 billion in
retirement savings when the value of the company stock--which made up
more than half the total in their accounts--plummeted and they were
restricted from selling it. But the pension measure, like the accounting
bill, faces an uncertain fate because the Senate favors stricter
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the accounting bill passed by the House said its
provisions would have helped prevent Enron's collapse by requiring
companies to disclose off-balance-sheet transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Enron used off-the-books partnerships to hide hundreds of millions of
dollars in losses. Andersen was consultant and auditor for Enron at the
same time, an arrangement that critics say led to a conflict of interest
that ultimately may have delayed the timely disclosure of the energy
giant's financial weakness.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm is under criminal indictment for alleged
obstruction of justice in connection with the destruction of
Enron-related documents.</TE>
<TE>   Other Enron-inspired aspects of the legislation approved Wednesday
include a ban on corporate executives' trading stock when employees are
locked out of making changes in their company stock retirement portfolios
and a prohibition against company officials' interfering with outside
auditors.</TE>
<TE>   Under the House bill, an accounting oversight board would be created
at the SEC, replacing a largely self-regulating system for the industry.
The five-member board would include two accountants, a member of the
public and two others, who could be former but not current accountants.</TE>
<TE>   It would prohibit accounting firms from offering two types of
consulting for firms they audit--internal auditing and computer services.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats favor an accounting oversight board with no ties to the
industry and contend the Republican bill gives the SEC too much
discretion in setting rules for the new watchdog panel.</TE>
<TE>   They also advocate requiring companies to switch auditors every four
years and a "cooling-off" period forcing auditors to wait two years
before taking jobs with former clients.</TE>
<TE>   In Wednesday's House debate, some Democrats characterized the
GOP-backed legislation as an example of Republican coziness with big
business.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republican leadership, once again, is selling out to special
interests," said Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   Republicans responded that the bill seeks to strike a balance between
the need for more regulation and protecting corporations from too many
rules.</TE>

<HD>Army Chief Defends Enron Record, Stock Trades</HD>
<DH>Investigations: Secretary Thomas White's use of a military plane is
also the subject of a probe. He is still confident, however.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Beleaguered Army Secretary Thomas E. White said Wednesday that he
regrets missing the deadlines to divest his Enron Corp. stock holdings,
but said ongoing investigations of his finances and military travel are
not interfering with his job or harming his standing in the Bush
administration.</LD>
<LD>   White also disputed characterizations of the Enron subsidiary that he
helped lead for several years as a factory of fictitious profits, saying
that it was an above-board business unit that has been unfairly maligned
since Enron's collapse into bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   White asserted that he is "on solid ground" with members of Congress
and his boss, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. He expressed hope
that he has survived the worst of the intense scrutiny he has faced in
recent months, which also includes a probe of his use of a military
aircraft for personal business.</LD>
<TE>   "There aren't any new facts to come," White said. "It's the same old
stuff. Most all of it's been ground through 50 ways from Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   White's comments came during an interview with Times reporters in
which he touted his effectiveness as secretary of the Army and vigorously
defended his record at Enron, his employer for 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   His remarks were the most extensive he has offered since the
disclosure in recent weeks that he is being investigated by the Justice
Department and the Inspector General's Office at the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing confident and relaxed, if somewhat annoyed that questions of
his integrity persist, White said scrutiny of his record was inevitable
when Enron declared bankruptcy last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron is probably the most notorious bankruptcy in the history of
American business, at least in scale," he said. "I spent 11 years in the
corporation, so a lot of these questions are reasonable, and I have tried
to be as forthright and honest about it as I can."</TE>
<TE>   The most serious questions surrounding White center on his sales of
millions of dollars' worth of Enron stock last year, which he agreed to
when he was named Army secretary in May. Responding to inquiries from
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), White revealed in a series of
letters that while he was selling his stock, he was also making dozens of
phone calls to former colleagues at Enron.</TE>
<TE>   White acknowledged Wednesday that he has turned over records of his
Enron stock trades and phone calls to Enron employees to the Justice
Department. The department's interest in such items suggests that the FBI
may be looking for evidence that White took advantage of information from
company insiders while he was selling stock.</TE>
<TE>   White has said repeatedly that he never sought nor received inside
information, and that his calls were largely made out of concern for
former colleagues at a failing company. White said that the records in
question were turned over months ago, and that he has had no subsequent
contact with FBI investigators.</TE>
<TE>   White, a West Point graduate and retired brigadier general, joined
Enron in 1990. In his final years with the Houston-based company, he was
vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, a division created to take
advantage of deregulation around the country by helping large clients
find cheaper sources of power.</TE>
<TE>   Former employees have said the unit overstated profits by hundreds of
millions of dollars during White's tenure through questionable accounting
methods.</TE>
<TE>   But White passionately defended his stewardship of the division,
saying it was legitimately profitable, adhered to approved accounting
methods and never took part in any deal with Enron's notorious
off-balance sheet partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether any of the reassessments of Enron's earnings and
revenue can be traced to the subsidiary, White replied: "To my knowledge,
not one dime."</TE>
<TE>   When he was named Army secretary, White agreed to divest all of his
Enron holdings within 90 days. He subsequently received at least two
extensions. But he was reprimanded by the leadership of the Senate Armed
Services Committee when members learned that White continued to hold a
large chunk of Enron stock options into January and had failed to inform
them that he had accepted a pension partly paid by the company.</TE>
<TE>   Some on Capitol Hill have suggested that White may have been clinging
to his holdings in hopes that Enron stock would somehow rebound. But
White dismissed that theory, saying he was simply distracted.</TE>
<TE>   "In hindsight, I should have [divested sooner]," he said. "We were
fighting a war, and I didn't pay enough attention to it."</TE>
<TE>   White also has come under scrutiny for an official trip in March
during which he and his wife, traveling aboard a Defense Department jet,
stopped in Aspen, Colo., to sign papers on the sale of their
$6.5-million, three-story home there.</TE>
<TE>   White declined to discuss the matter Wednesday, except to say that he
is cooperating with an investigation by the Inspector General's Office.
He has previously said he was required to be on secure aircraft that
weekend and that Aspen was a logical and convenient stop on a trip that
included official business in Dallas and Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Even some of White's supporters say they are puzzled by White's
decision to visit Aspen and invite further scrutiny after the Enron
scandal had begun to subside.</TE>
<TE>   "Stopping in Colorado just doesn't seem like a prudent thing to do,"
said Ted Stroup, a former lieutenant general who is now vice president of
the Assn. of the U.S. Army, a nonprofit organization. "Unless you're
stopping to refuel," Stroup said, "it's a little too gray."</TE>
<TE>   Current and former military leaders say that White is generally held
in high regard as an advocate for the Army. But some voice concern that
his effectiveness is being eroded by his troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "The uniformed military still thinks highly of Secretary White," said
Dan Christman, a retired lieutenant general who until last year was the
superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy. "But what his record will
reflect will sadly be tarnished by the press that has surrounded what's
happened in Enron."</TE>
<TE>   One sign that White remains influential in the Pentagon is his recent
success in temporarily sparing two weapons programs targeted for
elimination by Rumsfeld: the Crusader artillery system and the Army's
beleaguered Comanche helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   "I fought for it," White said of the Crusader, "and I'll fight for it
again in the next budget cycle and the next."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, he expressed exasperation with speculation about his
personal finances, including suggestions that he is building a house in
Florida to take advantage of state law there that protects homes from
creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "That is one cockamamie theory," White said, noting that he is in no
danger of seeking bankruptcy protection. "I mean, really, people ought to
get a life."</TE>

<HD>Little Praise for Luggage Screening Plan</HD>
<DH>Security: The Dec. 31 deadline for all bags to be checked will be
met, Mineta says. But experts call the proposal flawed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta unveiled a plan Wednesday
to screen all checked airline baggage for explosives by the end of the
year, but independent experts said the proposal was flawed.</LD>
<LD>   Mineta said the Transportation Security Administration would deploy
1,100 computerized tomography scanners, which generate three-dimensional
images of objects inside closed bags. They will be supplemented with
4,700 trace-detection systems, which can pick up residue left by
explosives on the outside of closed bags or amid the contents of open
ones.</LD>
<LD>   The 429 U.S. airports that have commercial airline service will get
screening systems by Dec. 31, the deadline Congress established in last
year's aviation security bill, Mineta said.</LD>
<TE>   While many airports will get both systems, he said, some may have only
one. The $1-million CT scanners are more likely to go to larger airports,
and the $45,000 trace detectors to smaller ones. Nevertheless, Mineta
told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce audience: "We will insist on the same
high standards for all airports, large and small."</TE>
<TE>   Independent experts warned that trace detectors are not foolproof and
should not be used alone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that difficult to clean up an item so trace [detectors] will
not find anything," said aviation consultant Douglas Laird, a former
security director for Northwest Airlines. "What a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials say the trace-detection system is about 50%
effective on a closed bag and 85% effective if the bag is opened. It is
unclear whether the government will require that all bags screened with
that system be opened. Nationwide, airports handle about 1 billion pieces
of luggage a year.</TE>
<TE>   Criticism of the trace detectors was echoed by a technical expert on
explosive detection, who asked not to be identified. "They do not detect
all the explosives that one could use," the expert said. "It is not going
to add very much protection overall."</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Department officials said their own testing has assured
them that trace detectors are effective. Before Sept. 11, however, CT
scanners were the only technology approved by the Federal Aviation
Administration for explosive detection.</TE>
<TE>   Department officials said other security measures--such as ensuring
that passengers who check bags actually board their flights--would be
used in conjunction with the trace detectors.</TE>
<TE>   A compromise on explosive detection was necessary because Congress set
an unrealistically early deadline for deployment, said Rep. John L. Mica
(R-Fla.), chairman of the House transportation and infrastructure
subcommittee on aviation. There wasn't enough time to build and install
sufficient numbers of the more sophisticated CT scanners, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dec. 31 deadline has been controversial since Congress passed the
aviation security bill in November. Critics said that moving quickly
might lead to shortcuts that would weaken the new security system, and
Mineta initially said that the deadline could not be met. Transportation
Department Inspector General Kenneth Mead has urged Congress and the Bush
administration to back away from the deadline, but neither party has
wanted to be the first to budge.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, this will only be a temporary plan," Mica said. "It is my
hope that we can get to the next generation of equipment and technology.
I think that trace [detection] will give us the protection that we need
in the interim, and then we can change it out later on with better
technology."</TE>
<TE>   Mica said it would have been a mistake to opt exclusively for CT
scanners, because that technology is also likely to be overtaken by less
expensive and more reliable systems.</TE>
<TE>   But Laird, the aviation security consultant, noted that, in the
government, temporary solutions have a way of becoming permanent. "My
fear is that once they get the trace [detectors] up and in place, they
will find it more difficult to come up with the money for other systems."</TE>
<TE>   Because screening bags using trace detectors is more labor-intensive,
estimates of the number of screeners needed nationwide have more than
doubled, from 30,000 to 65,000. Mineta said that Baltimore-Washington
International Airport, which the government has used as a test facility,
will be the first to get a full complement of federal screeners, as
government employees take over that responsibility from private
contractors this summer.</TE>

<DL>JERSEY CITY, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>Scores of K-9 dogs and their police handlers paid tribute Wednesday
to Sirius, the only police dog to die in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Officers from around the country and their canine partners filed by a
wooden urn and a medal dedicated to Sirius during a ceremony that
featured bagpipes and a 21-gun salute.</LD>
<LD>   Officer David Lim broke down after Sirius' metal bowl, recovered from
the wreckage, was presented to him.</LD>
<TE>   "He can have this one day, I guess," said Lim, a Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey officer. "He did his job well at the World Trade
Center."</TE>
<TE>   As Lim went to help evacuate the trade center when it was attacked
Sept. 11, he expected to return for the dog he left behind in a basement
kennel.</TE>
<TE>   But the towers collapsed, and Lim was trapped in the debris for
several hours. No one was able to save the 5-year-old yellow Labrador
retriever.</TE>
<TE>   Sirius was among bomb-sniffing dogs first stationed at the trade
center's loading dock after a 1993 terrorist bombing. His remains were
found in January.</TE>
<TE>   Lim has been reassigned to work as an officer at the Holland and
Lincoln tunnels and has a new partner, a 2-year-old black Labrador
retriever named Sprig.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got big paws to fill," Lim said.</TE>

<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>Rejecting defense arguments that a software engineer believed he
was traveling back in time to kill Nazis when he fatally shot seven
co-workers, a jury on Wednesday found Michael McDermott guilty of seven
counts of first-degree murder.</LD>
<LD>   After 16 hours of deliberations, the 43-year-old McDermott--an
imposing figure called "Mucko"--also was convicted on five felony
weapons-related charges.</LD>
<LD>   The only sentence in Massachusetts for first-degree murder is life in
prison without parole.</LD>
<TE>   McDermott opened fire just after 11 a.m. on Dec. 26, 2000, at his
office at Edgewater Technology in Wakefield, north of Boston. As
employees screamed and scattered, McDermott gunned down seven colleagues
in one of the worst workplace massacres in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   Police found the 300-pound McDermott sitting in the office reception
area, armed with a 12-gauge pump action shotgun, an AK-47 semiautomatic
rifle with an attached 60-round large capacity feeding device and a
.32-caliber semiautomatic pistol.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said McDermott was angry because his employer was planning
to garnish his wages to settle a tax dispute with the Internal Revenue
Service. Five of his victims worked in the accounting department, which
was to oversee the IRS procedure.</TE>
<TE>   But McDermott claimed he was insane. He testified that he had used a
time portal in the lobby of his company's headquarters to travel to 1940
Berlin to kill Adolf Hitler and six of his generals in order to stop the
Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   In two days on the witness stand, McDermott calmly told the court that
he had a mission from St. Michael the Archangel to prevent the Holocaust.
He said he heard Hitler's thoughts, and he sent family members of the
victims fleeing from the courtroom in tears when he methodically
described killing the "Nazis" one by one.</TE>
<TE>   "The last Nazi was there. I shot and killed him. And Hitler was there.
I shot and killed him," McDermott testified. "My mission was complete. I
knew at this point I had a soul."</TE>
<TE>   He also explained that he grew his hair long to silence a chorus of
voices that talked incessantly to him.</TE>
<TE>   When he was not testifying, the huge man with unkempt hair and a bushy
beard spent his time in court reading the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors revealed that McDermott bought a book on how to fake
mental illness and researched the subject on the Internet. They said he
carefully plotted his killings, taking target practice two days before
his rampage. The story about Nazis, according to prosecutors, was a
clever ruse dreamed up by McDermott to avoid prison.</TE>
<TE>   "He's absolutely faking," declared Michael Annunziata, a psychiatrist
and prosecution witness.</TE>
<TE>   McDermott's attorney, Kevin Reddington, countered in closing arguments
that "this is, up close and personal, a very sick man."</TE>
<TE>   While not ignoring McDermott's long history of mental
illness--including treatment for depression and several suicide
attempts--prosecutors maintained that he understood the consequences of
his actions when he opened fire at his workplace.</TE>
<TE>   "The lives of seven innocent people were taken in a cruel and
atrocious act," Middlesex County Dist. Atty. Martha Coakley said
Wednesday. "Our goal from the outset has been to hold Michael McDermott
responsible for his actions."</TE>

</DL>
<LD>As Nevada officials fight against hosting the nation's nuclear
repository, the state is offering license plates bearing the image of a
nuclear blast.</LD>
<LD>   The fund-raising license plate designed to honor Nevada's atomic past
has bombed with some as ill-timed and inappropriate. Others don't have a
problem with the idea of cars with optional mushroom cloud license plates
sharing roads with tractor-trailers hauling radioactive waste to Yucca
Mountain.</LD>
<LD>   "Nevada being Nevada, this is a unique subject," said Rick Bibbero,
55, a real estate agent in Minden who won $500 with his design for the
license tag.</LD>
<TE>   "You wouldn't find California trying to memorialize something like
this, but this is our past," said Bibbero, who said he's neither for nor
against the federal government's plan to entomb 77,000 tons of highly
radioactive waste beneath a volcanic ridge 90 miles northwest of Las
Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Kalynda Tilges of Las Vegas had a word for the new multicolor license
plates that bear a mushroom cloud, a nucleus-and-atom logo for atomic
energy and Albert Einstein's formula for the theory of relativity:
"Abomination."</TE>
<TE>   "I would have rather seen a 'Fight Yucca Mountain' license plate with
proceeds to go to fighting the dump," said Tilges.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Jacobs, spokesman for the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles,
acknowledged some state residents have had what he called "an emotional
response" to the mushroom cloud license plate design.</TE>
<TE>   But the DMV also has received 322 advance requests for the new plates,
which he said are due to begin rolling off the presses this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a historical fact that they used to explode nuclear bombs in the
desert," Jacobs said.</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers approved the idea last year, earmarking $25 of the $61
custom license plate registration fee for the Nevada Atomic Testing
History Institute, a Las Vegas museum and research center expected to
open next year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an important part of Nevada history and national and
international history," said state Senate Minority Leader Dina Titus
(D-Las Vegas). She sponsored the bill and recalled little opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Nevadans think testing was patriotic," Titus said. "It was
done for the good of the country during the Cold War."</TE>
<TE>   The institute is expected to store, catalog and study documents and
memorabilia from the Test Site--a vast federal reservation north of Las
Vegas where nuclear testing was conducted above and below ground from
1952 to 1992.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Gov. Kenny Guinn called the timing of the mushroom
cloud license plate a coincidence.</TE>

Trial</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors reversed course Wednesday and agreed to ask a
federal judge to delay the espionage trial of a retired Air Force master
sergeant accused of plotting to spy for Iraq, China and Libya.</LD>
<LD>   Government lawyers told U.S. District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee in
Alexandria, Va., that they support the request by defense lawyers to push
back the trial date for Brian Patrick Regan, 39.</LD>
<LD>   Lee this week scheduled a June 3 trial, which defense lawyers assailed
as too soon for a death penalty case.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Paul McNulty said Tuesday that prosecutors would neither
support nor oppose the request by Regan's lawyers to delay the trial. But
Wednesday's court filing by prosecutors said the arguments by defense
lawyers for more time were made in good faith.</TE>
<TE>   The government acknowledged that it would take at least 45 days to
obtain security clearances to allow defense experts to examine classified
documents. The trial date set by the judge gave the sides just 43 days
before testimony begins.</TE>
<TE>   Regan worked for the Air Force and briefly for TRW Inc., a defense
contractor.</TE>

<HD>Agencies at Odds Over Wyoming Methane Project</HD>
<DH>Environment: The EPA's Denver office calls the BLM impact statement
unsatisfactory. Report provides a glimpse at interagency discord.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Denver office of the Environmental Protection Agency is
threatening to give the Interior Department a failing grade for blessing
a massive methane drilling project in northeastern Wyoming, according to
draft documents.</LD>
<LD>   EPA and Interior documents obtained by The Times provide a rare view
into the internal discord sparked by President Bush's mandate to expedite
and increase energy production from federal lands.</LD>
<LD>   Although written in the bureaucratic language of government, the
documents reveal deep disagreements concerning the Interior Department's
plans for the Powder River Basin, which is managed by the department's
Bureau of Land Management.</LD>
<TE>   Among the documents is the Denver EPA office's analysis of the BLM's
900-page draft environmental impact statement for its plans for drilling
more than 51,000 coal-bed methane wells in the Powder River Basin.</TE>
<TE>   "The EPA considers the Wyoming draft [environmental impact statement]
to be inadequate because it did not include an alternative that would
meet water quality standards for irrigated agriculture," wrote Jack W.
McGraw, the EPA's acting regional director, in a draft of the agency's
formal comment about the project.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA gave the BLM's environmental impact statement a rating of
"EU-3"--environmentally unsatisfactory. That means the EPA identified
significant risks to the public health or to the local environment.</TE>
<TE>   It indicates that EPA officials believe far-reaching changes should be
made to the draft environmental impact statement before it is made
public. If the EPA's concerns are not corrected by the BLM, the Powder
River proposal will be referred to the White House Council on
Environmental Quality for review. This could delay the project for
months.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what happens when you try to streamline environmentally
sensitive projects," said Tom Darin, public lands director for Wyoming
Outdoor Council, the environmental group that provided the documents to
The Times. "They should have done a better study, and then maybe they
could have had it done on time."</TE>
<TE>   This potential setback for Powder River Basin comes just a week after
the Senate rejected the Bush administration's top energy priority:
drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Oil and gas
production in the West have become a higher priority for the
administration, and the Powder River Basin project is the biggest test
yet of whether Bush can increase production there.</TE>
<TE>   Max Dodson, an assistant regional administrator in the EPA's Denver
bureau, stressed that his office's letter and detailed analysis were
draft documents that have been sent to Washington and are subject to
change.</TE>
<TE>   Dodson explained that the EPA's comments were sent to headquarters for
review a week or so before a deadline for public comment on the BLM's
environmental impact statement. Two days before that deadline, the BLM
extended it, from April 18 to May 15.</TE>
<TE>   The later deadline gives the two agencies more time to work out their
differences in private, and local environmentalists in Wyoming fear it
will give Interior officials time to put pressure on EPA officials to
give better marks to the impact statement.</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials in Washington said it was too early to say what the
agency's final comment would look like. "There's still a lot of work
that's underway on this," EPA spokesman Joe Martyak said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Dodson nor McGraw suggested that the political appointees in
Washington have criticized their work or attempted to rewrite it.</TE>
<TE>   "Headquarters is not second-guessing us," McGraw said earlier this
week.</TE>
<TE>   The Denver EPA's comments apparently raised the ire of Deputy Interior
Secretary J. Steven Griles, who wrote Deputy EPA Administrator Linda
Fisher on Sept. 12 and asked her to find another way to address the EPA's
concerns rather than writing a comment letter that might "impede the
ability to move forward in a constructive manner."</TE>
<TE>   Griles questioned why McGraw, a career EPA official, was proposing to
take such "significant action" just days before the politically appointed
head of the Denver office was scheduled to take over from him.</TE>
<TE>   Although coal-bed methane has been under production for several years
in the Powder River Basin, only about 2% of the 25 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable reserves estimated in the basin have been produced. Once
finished, the BLM's environmental impact statement will set the tone for
future development and be a good test of the Bush administration's
commitment to care for the environment as it boosts energy production.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA's draft comments focused on the problems posed by the 4.4
million acre-feet of ground water that will be brought to the surface
from the estimated 51,367 coal-bed methane wells that will be drilled in
the area over a decade or so.</TE>
<TE>   If the water is allowed to flow to surface streams and rivers, as
allowed in the BLM's preferred alternative, "it would make the Tongue
River and the Belle Fourche River unsuitable for irrigation," the draft
letter said.</TE>
<TE>   That would violate state rules that forbid degradation of water
quality that decreases crop or livestock production, the letter stated.</TE>
<TE>   The ground water being extracted in much of the targeted area has high
levels of sodium, which can permanently destroy the soil's ability to
absorb water and support plant life.</TE>
<TE>   The water problem already is vexing the companies that have drilled
more than 5,000 wells on private and state land in the area. More than
half of the mineral rights in Powder River Basin belong to the federal
government, but most of the production of that gas is on hold while the
BLM completes it environmental impact statement procedure.</TE>
<TE>   The companies have sought ways to re-inject water into the ground, but
only one of 18 efforts has been successful. The current working solution
is to keep the water in huge reservoirs next to each well, but
environmentalists fear that water will seep out and harm nearby rivers
and irrigation streams.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA letter also raises concerns about the impact on air quality
caused by 17,000 miles of gravel and dirt roads that will be built as
part of the development. In general it says that the BLM failed to
adequately address the impact on wildlife. Specifically lacking, it said,
was a discussion of how to avoid electrocution of golden eagles from
overhead power lines.</TE>

<HD>House Committee Votes to Renew 'Abstinence-Only' Program on Sex</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A House committee voted to renew a contentious sexual abstinence
program Wednesday after rejecting a Democratic attempt to let states
decide whether to include discussion of birth control methods.</LD>
<LD>   The vigorous debate stood in sharp contrast to five years ago, when
Congress tacked the program onto welfare legislation with almost no
public discussion.</LD>
<LD>   Majority Republicans defended the "abstinence-only" program, and the
House Commerce Committee voted, 35 to 17, to extend it for another five
years.</LD>
<TE>   "If your state doesn't want it, they don't have to take it," committee
Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) said. "They can abstain."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats spoke in favor of "abstinence-plus" programs, which are used
in many schools. Such programs emphasize that abstaining from sex is a
person's best choice and the only sure way to prevent pregnancy and
disease, but they urge those who have sex anyway to use condoms or other
protections.</TE>
<TE>   The federal law bars discussion of the benefits of birth control and
instructs programs to teach that any sex outside marriage has harmful
consequences.</TE>

<HD>With Hubble's Help, Researchers Put Universe's Age at 14 Billion</HD>
<DH>Astronomy: The telescope was used to examine the faint husks of the
oldest stars in the galaxy--7,000 light years from Earth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES SCIENCE WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By examining the feeble, burned-out husks of the oldest stars in
our galaxy with the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have shown that
the universe is at least 14 billion years old.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists described Wednesday's news as "like suddenly opening a
drawer and finding your birth certificate," said Bruce Margon, an
associate director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, the
organization that operates Hubble.</LD>
<LD>   The new birthday lies within the best estimated range of the age of
the universe to date: 13 billion to 14 billion years. The independent
confirmation suggests that, after decades of sometimes frustrating work,
astronomers using entirely different methods finally are nearing the
correct answer. Such unanimity on a basic fact is crucial in answering
more sophisticated questions about how the universe behaves.</LD>
<TE>   "It makes everybody feel happier that we each individually know what
we are talking about," said Brad Hansen, a postdoctoral astronomy
researcher at UCLA who helped create the new measurement with Harvey
Richer, an astronomer at the University of British Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is such a basic measurement and fundamental to understanding
how the universe was created and evolved, determining the age of the
universe has proved excruciatingly difficult. Until a few years ago,
estimates of the age ranged from a whopping 20 billion years to a mere 8
billion--an age that suggested the unsettling notion that the universe
was younger than the stars within it.</TE>
<TE>   The new measurement was made by looking at the charred remnants of
white dwarfs, massive stars that burned out long ago. Because these stars
cool at a constant rate, they are sometimes called "clockwork stars."
Scientists can estimate the age of the universe by measuring the color
and brightness of the remains of these white dwarfs and then calculating
how long it had taken for a star to cool to its current state.</TE>
<TE>   It is the equivalent of estimating how long ago a campfire was burning
by measuring the temperature of the smoldering coals it left behind.
Because these coals were billions of years old, they were very faint. For
years, astronomers did not even bother trying to look for them, Hansen
said. "People thought they were too faint, that they weren't observable."</TE>
<TE>   But modeling work by Hansen showed that the old dead stars were not
merely "black bodies," but gave off visible light because of the
complexities of their atmospheres.</TE>
<TE>   Given this information, Richer and his team decided to use the Hubble
telescope to find the ancient star remnants. Because they are so faint,
detecting them required an exposure of eight days.</TE>
<TE>   The stars studied were in the densely packed globular star cluster M4,
which lies just 7,000 light years from Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The dead stars are so faint, they are less than one-billionth the
brightness of stars visible to the naked eye. The astronomers focused on
globular star clusters because they are among the oldest objects in the
universe.</TE>
<TE>   The stars that were studied were thought to have formed about 1
billion years after the Big Bang, according to leading theories. That
means that, if the stars are approximately 13 billion years old, the
universe is at least 14 billion years old.</TE>
<TE>   If future work shows that more time passed between the Big Bang and
the formation of the first globular star clusters, it would mean the
universe is older than 14 billion years. But astronomers said it was
unlikely anything would change the estimation that the universe is at
least 14 billion years old.</TE>
<TE>   Previous work by Wendy L. Freedman of the Carnegie Observatories in
Pasadena had estimated the age of the universe by trying to measure how
quickly it is expanding. The astronomers did this by measuring how fast
other galaxies were moving away and how far away they were.</TE>
<TE>   This expansion rate is known as the Hubble constant, for Edwin Hubble,
a California astronomer who in 1929 discovered that the galaxies were
flying outward at speeds that increase as they get farther away.
Precisely determining the expansion rate long has been one of the
outstanding questions in cosmology.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, Freedman used the Hubble telescope to measure the
distances of stars of variable brightness, called Cepheids, to accurately
determine the universe's current rate of expansion. Some of the early
results suggested that the universe was only 8 billion years old, younger
than its stars.</TE>
<TE>   The universe also threw a wrench in the works. Studies of distant,
exploding supernovae showed that the universe was not expanding at a
constant rate. Because the universe expanded more slowly in the past,
then suddenly shifted into high gear, it was difficult to pinpoint its
age.</TE>
<TE>   Astronomers came up with a new notion--a mysterious force called dark
energy that is speeding up the pace at which the universe expands.</TE>
<TE>   Even though astronomers admit they have no idea what dark energy is or
how it works, they added it to their estimates of the age of the
universe. That boosted the age estimate from 8 billion or 9 billion years
to the current 14 billion years, Freedman said.</TE>
<TE>   The new measurement of aging stars is an entirely different method and
does not rely on expansion rates or dark energy.</TE>
<TE>   Freedman did not participate in the experiment announced Wednesday but
was among the first to applaud the result.</TE>
<TE>   "What's pleasing about the whole field is that many different methods
are all pointing in very similar directions," she said.</TE>

<HD>Kidnapped Woman's Plea for Help Answered</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAVANNAH, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>A woman who says her trucker boyfriend beat her and held her
captive for six months thanked a janitor and Tennessee police Wednesday
for answering a plea for help she scrawled on a restroom wall.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd probably be dead now if it wasn't for them," Katina Shaddix said
on ABC's "Good Morning America."</LD>
<LD>   Binford Aycock was cleaning the bathroom at an Interstate 75 rest stop
Friday in McMinn County, Tenn., when he found a message scrawled in black
marker: "Won't let me out. Beating me, this is no joke!" The message also
referred to "Cannon truck 383."</LD>
<TE>   Aycock called 911, and officials used a satellite positioning system
to trace the truck to a rest area on Interstate 16 in Georgia. The
boyfriend, a trucker with Cannon Express Corp., was hauling light bulbs
to a Wal-Mart in Douglas, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   Shaddix, 24, told police that she had hidden a marker in her sock and
left more than 30 messages in restrooms from New York to Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   She was released Wednesday from the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The truck driver, Shannon E. Jones, 26, of Delhi, N.Y., was charged
Wednesday with kidnapping. He has been jailed since Saturday on
aggravated assault charges.</TE>
<TE>   Aycock, 70, said he knew the message was for real, and he "wouldn't
want anybody to turn their back on me if I was in that situation."</TE>
<TE>   Shaddix said she had been with Jones for about 18 months. She said he
became abusive two months into their relationship and refused to let her
leave.</TE>
<TE>   Cannon President Dean Cannon said the company is cooperating with the
FBI, which has asked for records on Jones. He said Shaddix had signed a
company form on Jan. 10 authorizing her as a rider in Jones' truck.</TE>

<LD>Concord High--A story in Tuesday's California section implied that
Katrina Sarkissian, who fatally stabbed a 15-year-old girl last fall, was
once a full-time student at Concord High School in Santa Monica.
Sarkissian, 17, took two summer courses at Concord in 1999 but was never
a regular student. Such students must pass an interview for admittance
and their academic records are scrutinized, according to Susan Packer
Davis, Concord's administrator.</LD>

<HD>Ex-Cop Pleads No Contest to Extortion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former LAPD motorcycle officer pleaded no contest Wednesday to
participating in an extortion plot to steal $1 million from a
Lakewood real estate broker, according to the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Melvin Leon Boyd, 38, entered the plea to one count of extortion
and one count of conspiracy to commit extortion. In exchange,
prosecutors dropped additional extortion, robbery and theft charges.
Boyd could face from one year in County Jail to three years in state
prison when he is sentenced June 6 in Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Max Huntsman said he planned to ask Judge David
Wesley to send Boyd to prison.</LD>
<TE>   "A police officer with a gun on his belt who commits a crime
should go to prison, regardless of the fact that he has no prior
record," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Boyd's attorney, Bradley Brunon, said his client served eight
years in the Marines and 12 years in the Los Angeles Police
Department. Boyd should get the lighter sentence because of his
record as a public servant, the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "He made what turned out to be an extraordinarily bad decision,"
Brunon said, adding that his client's involvement lasted only a few
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd is one of six people charged in the case. He is the fourth to
enter a plea of no contest. Two others--Walter Duarte and Jose
Quinonez--are scheduled to go to trial Friday.</TE>
<TE>   On May 24, 2001, Boyd posed as a detective while Terrayne Reginald
Evans told the broker at the man's Lakewood office that he was being
investigated for involvement in organized crime and threatened to
arrest him if he did not pay them, Huntsman said. The men demanded a
total of $1 million, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   The real estate broker gave them $2,700 and an expensive watch and
agreed to subsequent meetings to pay the rest. Boyd did not
participate in other meetings.</TE>
<TE>   The county Sheriff's Department launched an investigation after
the broker called authorities and said he had been robbed. Charges
were filed against four men and two women.</TE>
<TE>   Evans pleaded no contest to extortion and to grand theft. Kristina
Dillon and Milagro Santamaria pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor
charge of auto tampering, prosecutors said.</TE>

<LD>   The driver of the tow truck was injured and taken to County-USC
Medical Center. The seriousness of his injuries was not immediately
known, said Ed Scannell, an MTA spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   He did not know the train's speed but said it was northbound when
the tow truck plunged through a fence running along the track and
struck the side of its first car near 48th Place and Long Beach
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Both northbound and southbound lines were temporarily closed.</TE>

<HD>San Juan Group's Bid to Save Youth Center Fails</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Boys &amp; Girls Club will close its facility in a
Latino area after fund-raising to keep it open another month falls
short.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A community-based group raised more than $11,000 in less than two
weeks in hopes of keeping a Boys &amp; Girls Club open in San Juan
Capistrano. But it appears the effort was in vain.</LD>
<LD>   The facility in a predominantly Latino neighborhood will close May
3, club officials said Wednesday. Trustees of the Boys &amp; Girls Club
of Capistrano Valley announced last month that a $200,000 budget
shortfall was forcing the closure of their El Camino site, which they
said is in disrepair and too small to handle the community's needs.</LD>
<LD>   Ten days ago, the organization's board told parents and community
activists they would need to raise nearly $13,000 by Tuesday to keep
the facility open another month. The group fell about $1,800 shy of
its goal and failed to negotiate a long-term lease with the
Capistrano Unified School District, which owns the El Camino
facility.</LD>
<TE>   Beginning May 6, the children who now use the dilapidated
five-room facility will be bused two miles to a 2-year-old club near
Marco F. Forster Middle School.</TE>
<TE>   "We appreciate all the effort. We support the spirit of what that
group did," said James Littlejohn, executive director of the Boys &amp;
Girls Club of Capistrano Valley. "Now I'd like their support in
making this a smooth transition to the other site, so we can continue
to provide the kids of this area with the programs and services they
need."</TE>
<TE>   But group leaders Wednesday wondered how many of the 100 youths
will use the new club, which already serves more than 300 children.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the parents in the neighborhood don't have access to
cars," said Gia Lugo, whose niece is a member of El Camino. "And most
of them don't want to send their kids to a bunch of virtual
strangers."</TE>
<TE>   Lugo said her group hopes to reopen El Camino under another
organization or move it to a different location.</TE>
<TE>   Littlejohn said the board is going out of its way to make El
Camino children feel welcome at the newer facility, which is four
times larger and in an upscale section of town. He said a school
district bus and club van will shuttle the youths between the newer
club and San Juan Elementary School, which most of El Camino's
children attend.</TE>
<TE>   "We're having a trial run next week with the bus system,"
Littlejohn said. "We want the parents to see the facility, and we
want the children to feel comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   David M. Swerdlin, a San Juan Capistrano councilman, said he
sympathizes with both groups and hopes the situation does not disrupt
the community.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing breaks my heart," he said. "It would be very
easy for the folks in that area to think there's discrimination. But
it's based on a fiscal reality. I'd hate to see the [El Camino]
parents give up on the club."</TE>

<HD>Accused Priest Blames Cultural Differences</HD>
<DH>Crime: The Pomona clergyman alleged to have molested two
girls acknowledges wrestling with them but says such contact is
common among Filipinos.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and GENE MADDAUS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Pomona priest in jail on suspicion of molesting two girls said
Wednesday that the allegations stem from a cultural misunderstanding.</LD>
<LD>   Honesto Bismonte, 72, of St. Joseph's Catholic Church, was
arrested Tuesday for allegedly molesting the girls about 50 times
since 1997, when they were 8 and 12.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking from the West Valley Detention Center in Rancho
Cucamonga, Bismonte said that hugging and physical contact with
children is far more accepted in his Filipino culture. "I'm sorry
this has come this far," he said, blaming the wave of current
allegations against priests for his plight.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives also are investigating
Father Patrick Cotter, 70, a retired priest who once worked at St.
Joseph's. He allegedly was involved with a girl there several years
ago, sources said, an accusation referred from the Los Angeles Police
Department. Cotter, of South Pasadena, did not return telephone calls
for comment. An archdiocese spokesman said Cotter is retired and not
attached to any parish.</TE>
<TE>   The probe of Cotter is one of several investigations of clergy
being conducted by the sheriff's family crimes unit.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives said they have expanded their probe of Father David
Granadino, 46, from the time he has worked at St. Frances of Rome in
Azusa, where he now is pastor, to his former church, St. John of God
in Norwalk.</TE>
<TE>   "There are several adult males who have reported being molested by
Granadino at the Norwalk church when they were kids more than 15
years ago," said Sheriff's Sgt. Dan Scott.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives have interviewed more than 100 children and parents
since a March 22 call to the Los Angeles archdiocese hotline, which
was created to report sexual abuse allegations. Scott said detectives
know of as many as five allegations of "inappropriate touching" by
Granadino during church activities at the Azusa parish. Granadino, a
Sheriff's Department chaplain, has denied any misconduct, according
to an exchange of e-mails by top archdiocese officials.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Rancho Cucamonga, Bismonte remains in jail in lieu
of $200,000 bail as the San Bernardino County district attorney
decides whether to press charges.</TE>
<TE>   Bismonte acknowledged taking the girls to the park to play on the
swings and said, "we used to wrestle." Fontana Police Sgt. Robert
Beltran said the girls told detectives the priest touched them over
and under their clothing. Bismonte shared an apartment in Fontana
with the girls' aunt, who would frequently baby-sit the children,
Beltran said. The girls said the touching stopped in 2001, according
to Beltran, when Bismonte moved out of the apartment.</TE>
<TE>   The girls initially withheld the information. "There was some
hesitance on the part of the victims and the victims' mother, out of
respect for the priest and the position he held," Beltran said.</TE>
<TE>   Bismonte said he believed that the girls came forward because of
publicity over abuse accusations against priests. "The plaintiffs'
credibility is weak," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, Bismonte was assigned to St. Joseph's, which
also operates a school. He served previously at St. Anthony of Padua
in Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran said the allegations were reported to a school official,
who informed the county Department of Children and Family Services.
Social workers contacted Fontana police.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese officials learned of the allegations last week and put
the priest on leave, said Tod Tamberg, an archdiocese spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Bismonte informed the archdiocese last week after the girls'
family told the priest of the allegations, said Don Steier,
Bismonte's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Fontana police detectives were still working on the case late
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino County Deputy Dist. Atty. Ben Gonzales, who
oversees the Fontana office, said he did not expect the police
reports to be filed until today.</TE>

<HD>Panel Hears Final Report on Valley Secession</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Campaigns for and against the plan are solidifying
as LAFCO approaches a decision on whether to put it on the November
ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Promoters hawked "Free the Valley" T-shirts outside and tempers
flared inside as the state commission reviewing San Fernando Valley
secession heard its final report on the subject Wednesday, flipping
the long-running debate into the chaotic world of elective politics.</LD>
<LD>   The commission is expected to vote May 15 on whether to put the
matter before voters this fall.</LD>
<LD>   With an election apparently shaping up, the campaigns for and
against secession are solidifying.</LD>
<TE>   Both sides are raising money, and former Mayor Richard Riordan,
who enjoyed strong support in the Valley, said Wednesday he has
signed on as a co-chairman of the campaign to defeat secession. As
mayor, Riordan denounced secession as impractical, politically unwise
and immoral.</TE>
<TE>   The report presented Wednesday addressed the practical side of
those arguments, spelling out some of the details on how a breakup
might be accomplished. It urged the Local Agency Formation Commission
to approve a proposal by the pro-secession group Valley VOTE to
create a new city out of the arrowhead-shaped San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by the commission and placed on the November ballot,
voters could split the Valley off from the rest of Los Angeles,
creating a city of 1.35 million people that would be the nation's
sixth-largest, roughly the size of Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   But even as the issue heads toward an expected reckoning with Los
Angeles voters, legal questions continue to arise regarding details
on what secession would mean for the city it created and the one it
left behind.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the
commission, demanded that the city promise not to charge Valley
residents more for water and power if a new city is approved.</TE>
<TE>   The report, released April 19, recommended that Los Angeles be
forbidden to charge higher rates to residents of a new municipality,
but L.A. officials have said repeatedly they do not believe LAFCO has
that power.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to Yaroslavsky's comments, Fred Merkin, special
assistant city attorney, replied that the city does not believe LAFCO
has the power to order the city to charge the same rate to Valley
residents.</TE>
<TE>   That response infuriated LAFCO Executive Director Larry Calemine,
who said he was "stunned" the city would not agree to the
requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine threatened to recommend breaking up the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power if the city did not agree in writing by
May 15 to charge Valley residents the same rates as those assessed to
Los Angeles customers if the two areas break apart.The commission has
received conflicting legal opinions on that issue. Its own lawyers
have said LAFCO has the power to forbid Los Angeles from charging
more to Valley residents, but does not have the power to break up the
DWP.</TE>
<TE>   The state legislative counsel, however, has said LAFCO can break
up the utility.</TE>
<TE>   And Los Angeles' chief administrative officer, Ron Deaton, said
city officials could elect to raise rates as they felt necessary and
then allow the new city to challenge that move in court.</TE>
<TE>   The LAFCO report on the Valley, which cost more than $2 million
and has been in the works for 21/2 years, said a Valley city would be
financially healthy on its own, though it would have to pay $55.8
million per year to Los Angeles to make up for revenue the older city
would lose if the area secedes.</TE>
<TE>   Similar proposals are under study regarding possible secession by
Hollywood and the harbor area, with final reports on those areas
expected over the next month.</TE>

<HD>John Wayne Bonds Taken Off Credit Watch</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A national rating bureau removed John Wayne Airport revenue bonds
from credit watch this week, citing the airport's rebound from a loss
of business after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Standard &amp; Poor's placed the bonds on watch status Sept. 20, along
with bonds from all other U.S. airports. Passenger traffic, which has
bounced back faster at John Wayne than at other facilities, was down
about 10% in 2001 from the year before.</LD>
<LD>   County supervisors last month raised parking and other airport
fees to cover a $12-million increase in security costs. This month,
supervisors ended eight years of planning for an airport at the
closed El Toro Marine base, which had used more than $40 million in
revenue from John Wayne Airport since 1994.</LD>

<HD>Assembly Panel OKs Bill to End Sewage Waiver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state Assembly committee this week approved a bill that would end a
local agency's ability to dump dirtier sewage into the ocean than is
allowed almost anywhere else in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Sanitation District has a five-year waiver
allowing it to release the moderately treated sewage. The district
must decide by year's end whether it will apply to renew that waiver,
which expires next year. The bill seeks to stop that renewal.</LD>
<LD>   "Swimming off the coast of Orange County shouldn't require a
hepatitis vaccination," said Assemblyman Ken Maddox (R-Garden Grove),
a sponsor of the bill, which would also end similar waivers in San
Diego, Goleta and Morro Bay.</LD>

<LD>A suspected car thief was critically injured after being crushed by
the car he allegedly stole, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The man, whose name was not released, apparently jumped from the
moving car when detectives in the Foothill Division closed in on him,
said Lt. Steven Allen of the Valley Traffic Division. The car ran
into a wall, pinning the man underneath, Allen said.</LD>
<LD>   The incident, which is still under investigation, occurred about
9:30 a.m. Tuesday at Pierce Street and Glenoaks Boulevard.</LD>
<TE>   Because the man was injured during a pursuit, the Los Angeles
Police Department's Special Collision Investigative Division is
handling the case, authorities said.</TE>

<LD>A North Hollywood man charged with killing a 14-year-old girl in a
New Year's Day crash in Sun Valley pleaded guilty Wednesday to
manslaughter, prosecutors announced.</LD>
<LD>   Gerardo Flores, 29, pleaded guilty to two felony counts--gross
vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and driving with a blood
alcohol content of .08% or higher. Flores faces seven years, eight
months in state prison when he is sentenced May 20.</LD>
<LD>   Flores admitted to running a red light and hitting another car at
Roscoe and Laurel Canyon boulevards. The collision, which occurred
about 12:30 a.m., killed the girl and injured her 16-year-old
brother, prosecutors said.</LD>

<DH>Community: New Valley Glen mural, financed by city program,
transforms graffiti-covered wall into an urban asset.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Painter Gary Gertzweig worked alone on a quiet Wednesday morning,
putting finishing touches on the sunsets, butterflies and roses that
dotted the wall in a dusty back alley in Valley Glen.</LD>
<LD>   The artist from the North Hollywood-based Earth Harmony Foundation
was working on the first of several projects planned for the
neighborhood through the city's $3-million Targeted Neighborhood
Initiative, a beautification program run out of the mayor's office.</LD>
<LD>   The program, currently serving 14 neighborhoods, involves tree
plantings, sidewalk repairs, building facade improvements and, of
course, the mural.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the mayor's initiative, but each City Council office
[lobbied] for their areas to be designated and targeted," said Claire
Bartles, chief of staff for Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, whose district
includes Valley Glen.</TE>
<TE>   Work on the "Seeds of Peace" mural started Saturday with the help
of 45 second- and third-graders from Kittridge Street Elementary
School in Van Nuys. Armed with paintbrushes, the children spent a
boisterous day covering three graffiti-stained walls with pictures
celebrating peace and nature.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel joined the Kittridge children as they fanned out into the
alley behind the Taco Bell at Coldwater Canyon Avenue and Vanowen
Boulevard. Each filled 2-foot-wide "mini-bubbles" with stars, flowers
and animals.</TE>
<TE>   Gertzweig worked on larger figures surrounding each bubble: two
purple dolphins swimming toward the ocean surface, a boy sowing seeds
in a garden and a girl blowing bubbles near the foot of a range of
purple mountains.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Gertzweig concentrated on the details, filling in
the lavender fin of a dolphin here and dragging his brush through the
blue swirl of an ocean wave there.</TE>
<TE>   A self-described "Renaissance man" who paints, composes music and
plays the violin, Gertzweig, 42, was born and raised in the San
Fernando Valley. He even attended Kittridge and later taught music
there. Painting the mural not only gave him a chance to give back to
his neighborhood, he said, but also to show his appreciation for
nature.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible to bring nature to the city," Gertzweig said, who
recalled the "pockets of nature" that once existed in the Valley:
ponds he explored as a boy and cows he saw on a farm on Sherman Way.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where I first learned about nature.... It gave me a sense
of wonder that never left me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   No ponds or farms grace the Valley Glen streets now, but "at least
we can remind ourselves through art," Gertzweig said.</TE>
<TE>   The students can take pride in having a hand in the mural's
creation, said teacher Gloria Dominguez. "This is the community they
live in," she said. "They can drive by and always see what they did."</TE>

<HD>One Issue in the Secession Debate That Has a Relatively
Simple Solution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HARVEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who gets the Hollywood sign if Tinseltown secedes from L.A.? Some
Hollywoodites want it turned over to them. But L.A. City Councilman
Tom LaBonge says it's in Griffith Park--L.A., not Hollywood--and vows
he won't surrender the landmark.</LD>
<LD>   OK, everybody, settle down. This column has come up with a simple
solution: a little addition to the nine letters (see photo
illustration).</LD>
<LD>   And I'm not even charging for the advice, though I will insist on
sharing future marketing revenues produced by the sign.</LD>
<TE>   What is L.A., anyway? I've long harbored the suspicion that two or
three people write all the movies in Hollywood, as these bits of
dialogue would seem to indicate:</TE>
<TE>   * "This isn't America, Jack. This is L.A." (a cop in "Mulholland
Falls," a movie set in the '50s)</TE>
<TE>   * "We do not arrest the wrong person. That's L.A." (Pasadena cop
in "The Player")</TE>
<TE>   * "You may have escaped New York, but this is L.A." ("Escape from
L.A.")</TE>
<TE>   * "You can't hitchhike. This is L.A." ("White Men Can't Jump")</TE>
<TE>   * "So this is L.A. Everything looks the same." ("Mighty Joe
Young")</TE>
<TE>   * "This is not Los Angeles." (a male teacher in a small Indiana
town, horrified about being kissed on the lips by a male reporter, in
"In &amp; Out")</TE>
<TE>   * "Where do you think you are? L.A.?" (George Raft, to a Montreal
gangster in "A Bullet for Joey")</TE>
<TE>   The gangster didn't kiss Raft, by the way.</TE>
<TE>   Raft noticed he was packing a gun.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ecaping L.A.: While doing research for a children's book on the
Wilderness Road, Carl Green visited a historic site in Kentucky. And
he spotted a sign above the restroom that led him to believe the site
is frequently visited by schoolkids (see photo). Below the "Men" sign
there was another notice that said: "GET YOUR COONSKIN CAPS HERE."
Green says he didn't find any in there, though some were available in
the adjacent gift shop.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Relax--it's just the Bowser family again: The police log of my
second-favorite L.A. newspaper, the Los Alamitos News-Enterprise,
contained this item: "What was thought to be a couple shouting at
each other were some dogs fighting in the backyard."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't part of the property settlement: The News-Enterprise
also reported that a woman suspected that her ex-husband "swiped some
food off her barbecue after he was seen in the area."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Where to, Mack? I discussed L.A.'s bandit taxis and the ways their
owners dress them up so that they appear legal. One tip-off that they
are unlicensed, however, is the lack of a city seal on the side. And
some have misspellings; I saw one that called itself a "Taxy"
(especially painful to see around April 15).</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, reader R. Baker spotted another bandit cab that had a
subtle touch. It posted a phone number (853-1212) that is actually
the number you call for the time. Guess that driver didn't want to
put out his real number for law enforcement types to jot down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The International Carwash Assn. has given the 2002
Toyota Camry the title of "The Most Washable Car," based on its
"aerodynamic lines." Now perhaps my wife will understand why my Honda
Accord always looks so dirty.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Harvey can be reached at (800) LA-TIMES, Ext. 77083, by fax
at (213) 237-4712, and by mail at Metro, L.A. Times, 202 W. 1st St.,

the train's path could not be confirmed as of 1:10 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   The injured driver of the tow truck was taken to County-USC
Medical Center. The seriousness of his injuries was not immediately
known, said Ed Scannell, a spokesman for the MTA.</LD>
<TE>   He did not know the train's speed, but said it was heading north
when the tow truck plunged through a fence running alongside the
track and struck the side of the train's first car.</TE>

<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis and Democratic lawmakers heard more bad news
Monday. So did school districts and local governments. They learned
that the state's budget deficit just keeps growing.</LD>
<LD>   It's up to around $20 billion maybe. Don't look for an exact
figure. This is all guesswork and the numbers change every week.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats are in power so the blame falls on them, justly or not.
It's mostly not.</TE>
<TE>   This is mostly the fault of an unstable tax structure that relies
too heavily on volatile incomes--especially stock options and capital
gains--and not enough on stable property. But that gets into a debate
about Proposition 13. Another time.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't bad news for the out-party, Republicans. Their
target--Davis--just keeps getting bigger along with the deficit.</TE>
<TE>   So there's no deficit of demagoguery. "The governor's three-year
spending spree has brought the state to its fiscal knees," GOP
gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon asserted Wednesday after state
Controller Kathleen Connell said she needed to borrow up to $11
billion to keep money in the checking account.</TE>
<TE>   It's a favorite Republican mantra: Under Davis, general-fund
spending has increased 36%.</TE>
<TE>   Fine. And in Republican Pete Wilson's second term spending rose
37%. In Republican George Deukmejian's first term it climbed 45%. In
Ronald Reagan's first term it soared 61% and in his second, 72%. The
modern record: 95% in Democrat Jerry Brown's first term, when
Sacramento began shoveling bailout money to local governments after
voters passed Prop. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Those figures come from the the State Library.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Simon nor Republican legislators will specify which major
whacks they'd take out of programs. That's because cuts alone won't
solve this.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a reality check:</TE>
<TE>   * If you closed all 32 state university campuses--UC and CSU--it
would save only $6.1 billion in general-fund money, according to
nonpartisan Legislative Analyst Elizabeth G. Hill.</TE>
<TE>   * Empty all the prisons and you'd save $4.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Eliminate benefits for welfare families and "save" $2.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Those fantasies add to just $13.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so get serious: Shut down state government. Fire all the civil
servants, including those--like highway workers--who don't even draw
their checks from the general fund. You'd save $11 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that 70% of the $78-billion general fund flows to
schools and local government, Hill says. Schools--kindergarten
through community colleges--get 40%.</TE>
<TE>   So what can the state do? Well, it can raise taxes temporarily, as
gutsy Gov. Wilson did in 1991 during a recession. That's upfront and
honest.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) has proposed raising
income taxes by $2.5 billion on the wealthiest--couples with taxable
incomes exceeding $260,000.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) has advocated
returning vehicle license fees to their 1998 level, netting about $4
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Anybody for that stuff?</TE>
<TE>   "There's no will for a tax increase--from Jane and Joe Neighbor to
the corporate guys," says Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach),
new head of the Assembly Budget Committee. "We are a representative
government."</TE>
<TE>   But there's sure to be fee increases, including at parks. They're
a subtle version of tax hikes.</TE>
<TE>   And there'll be ugly cuts--in education, health care, help for the
aged and disabled. The state already has pared back roughly $5
billion.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way of avoiding pain in every corner of the state,"
Oropeza says. "We're going to try to be creative."</TE>
<TE>   Creative: Smoke and mirrors.</TE>
<TE>   "It is smoke and mirrors, that's fair," says Senate budget
chairman Steve Peace (D-El Cajon). "That doesn't make it a bad
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly. I'm all for smoke and mirrors. It's practical budget
policy and politics.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson never would have gotten through the recession without smoke
and mirrors--cooking numbers, raiding funds, sleight-of-hand money
shifts, borrowing to the hilt.</TE>
<TE>   The state undoubtedly will borrow--maybe $4 billion--from future
tobacco settlement payments. It will refinance about $2 billion in
previous borrowing. Interest rates couldn't be better.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and Democratic leaders will declare their eternal faith in
the recuperative powers of this great state. They will--and
should--underestimate spending and pad expected revenues. Just get a
budget passed in July. It's all guesswork anyway.</TE>
<TE>   If they're wrong, the Legislature can return after the November
election to increase taxes and inflict more pain.</TE>
<TE>   Smoke and mirrors may avoid--certainly delay--packing school
rooms, closing trauma centers and freeing prisoners. Not to mention
raising taxes.</TE>

<HD>State Borrowing Plan Is Unveiled</HD>
<DH>Finances: Controller says up to $11 billion could be tapped
to cope with budget deficit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Controller Kathleen Connell unveiled a plan Wednesday that would
allow the state to borrow as much as $11 billion to avoid an
anticipated cash crunch this summer.</LD>
<LD>   The need for the short-term loan traces back to last year's energy
crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The state must repay $5.7 billion it borrowed in August to cover a
cash shortage triggered when the general fund was tapped for billions
in electricity purchases. The $5.7-billion loan comes due in June,
the same month the state must pay schools $1.4 billion as part of its
Proposition 98 obligation to fund public education.</LD>
<TE>   The combination of big bills and weak tax receipts will leave the
state with a cash deficit of $4.6 billion by the end of July, Connell
said. She is seeking a cushion of $2.5 billion, bringing the state's
short-term cash need to about $7.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to make sure we have enough cash to pay our bills,"
Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   Factoring in the possibility of the need for another $422 million
in cash in August, Connell's plans call for the state to borrow $7.5
billion by June 1. The state could tap another $3.5 billion that
Connell is recommending Davis authorize if cash flow problems
continue into the fall, for a total of $11 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Clouding the state's fiscal outlook is whether lawmakers and Davis
will agree on a 2002-03 budget by July 1, the start of the new fiscal
year, or whether negotiations will drag into the summer or beyond.
Also complicating matters is the sale of bonds to officially
reimburse the state general fund $6.4 billion used to cover energy
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Connell said she expects the bond sale, which has faced numerous
delays, to take place in August. State Treasurer Phil Angelides has
not set a date for the sale, however.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Harrison, a spokesman for Davis' Department of Finance,
signaled Wednesday that the governor is prepared to sign off on
Connell's plan for the state to borrow $7.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is the right course of action to ensure that the
state has the funds it needs in the coming months to provide state
services and pay state employees," Harrison said.</TE>
<TE>   Connell's plan calls for the state to issue a revenue anticipation
warrant, a type of loan that can be repaid the following fiscal year.
She said she expects the deal to cost the state "millions" of dollars
in interest and credit enhancements, but she could not give a more
specific estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Credit enhancements are a type of insurance policy to guard buyers
of debt issued by the state against uncertainties, which in this case
are likely to include the state's budget and the energy bond sale.
The last revenue anticipation warrant issued by California--for $7.2
billion in 1994--required a credit enhancement that cost $33 million.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans reacted to Connell's announcement by attacking Davis,
whom they accused of being slow to respond to the state's growing
budget shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to drag him kicking and screaming to take action of any
kind," said Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   GOP gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr., speaking to reporters
after a speech at the Milken Institute conference in Beverly Hills,
said the cash crunch is more evidence of Davis' poor fiscal
management.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just the softening economy," Simon said. "It's the fact
Davis waited."</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Roger Salazar replied: "Those are big words from a
guy who can't even file his taxes on time."</TE>

<HD>Power Sellers Told to Bargain on Pacts</HD>
<DH>Energy: U.S. regulators decline to overturn electricity
contracts but order firms to renegotiate with state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators warned California on Wednesday that they will not
easily overturn long-term electricity deals signed during last year's
power crisis, but they moved to help the state renegotiate the
contracts on its own.</LD>
<LD>   Meeting in Washington, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
ordered electricity companies to return to the bargaining table with
California officials and a federal mediator to consider amending
deals signed when California faced soaring market prices and the
threat of blackouts.</LD>
<LD>   The commission order comes in response to a petition filed by the
California Public Utilities Commission in February. That petition
sought to break 44 long-term power deals with 22 sellers. The PUC
argued that the state was forced to overpay by $14 billion in the
contracts because they were signed when electricity sellers held sway
over the power market launched under a 1996 deregulation plan.</LD>
<TE>   Barry Goode, legal affairs director for Gov. Gray Davis, said the
federal order should prod energy companies that so far have been
reluctant to talk seriously about changing their contract prices and
terms.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't now think that FERC is not watching this," Goode said.
"They are going to have to come to grips with the fact that they made
contracts at a time when the market was dysfunctional."</TE>
<TE>   But a representative of energy companies said the order puts as
much pressure on the state as it does on power sellers. That's
because the federal commissioners stressed in their unanimous
decision that they are reluctant to break contracts, as California
has asked, without a clear showing that it would be in the greater
public interest to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading
Forum, called that an "extraordinarily high burden of proof."</TE>
<TE>   "I think we both now have, in our enlightened self-interest, a
reason to meet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This week, state officials enjoyed their first success in getting
power sellers to amend contracts. The Davis administration announced
Monday that after five months of talks it had reached agreement on
changes to eight contracts--including major deals with Calpine Corp.
and Constellation Energy Corp.--at a savings of $3.5 billion over the
next decade.</TE>
<TE>   California signed $43 billion worth of long-term power contracts
last spring after the state was forced to buy power for financially
crippled utilities. The contracts buffered the state from spot-market
prices for several months, but in June, for various reasons, market
prices crashed. Now the long-term contracts look expensive in
comparison, and numerous critics have made them a political burden
for Davis as he seeks reelection.</TE>
<TE>   After initially praising the contracts as a safeguard, Davis last
fall agreed with critics that they should be renegotiated. To improve
the state's leverage at the bargaining table, the PUC petitioned
federal regulators to overturn the contracts.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the PUC dismantled part of its own petition. It voted
to drop the claims against Calpine and Constellation as part of the
new agreements it reached with the companies.</TE>
<TE>   The federal commission praised California for its success in
reworking some contracts, and asked a federal mediator to report back
in 30 days on the state's progress in renegotiating other deals.</TE>

<HD>Victim Had Been Rider Since Line Opened</HD>
<DH>Death: Second man killed is identified as a computer
engineer from Riverside: 'He loved riding that train,' Lawrence
Sorensen's brother says.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawrence Sorensen loved NASCAR racing. But he wasn't big on driving,
especially when it meant creeping along the clogged Riverside County
freeways during rush hour.</LD>
<LD>   So the 48-year-old Riverside resident had taken Metrolink to his
job in Santa Ana since the day the commuter train service started in
1995. On Tuesday, he died on that routine trip after Metrolink Train
809 was hit head on by a mile-long freight train in Placentia.</LD>
<LD>   "He loved riding that train," said Todd Sorensen, his brother.
"He'd been taking it every day as long as there was a train. It was
very relaxing for him."</LD>
<TE>   The other victim, identified Tuesday, was Robert Kube, 59, of
Moreno Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Sorensen, who never married, lived alone in a house on Haven View
Drive, spending much of his free time with family that lives in the
area. He was born in Anaheim and spent a few years in the Air Force
in the late 1970s, where he learned computer engineering.</TE>
<TE>   At his job with a consulting company in Santa Ana, he worked on
software for government clients. The programs he helped create
allowed the courts to operate more smoothly and the Department of
Motor Vehicles to get better organized.</TE>
<TE>   Sorensen loved children--especially those who had an interest in
Civil War history. A war buff who collected books and magazines
covering details of the battles, Sorensen loved to pass on his
knowledge of American history. On the NASCAR track, Sorensen's hero
was the late Dale Earnhardt. "He was more into NASCAR than anything,"
his brother said.</TE>
<TE>   Downtime was spent fishing with his parents near Idyllwild. They
would reel in their catch from the shore or sometimes take a creaky
rowboat out onto the lake.</TE>
<TE>   "They went up there quite often," Todd Sorensen said.</TE>
<TE>   And the laid-back computer engineer loved his house. He was
finally able to buy a home in 1997 after saving for a decade while
living in a mobile home in Mira Loma. His brother, who lives about 30
minutes away in Running Springs, had helped him install a sprinkler
system a few days before the accident.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved that little home," Todd Sorensen said. "He was always
working on it, and he was very proud of it."</TE>
<TE>   Like so many other people in the Inland Empire, Sorensen was more
than willing to spend three hours commuting every day so that he
could own his own home.</TE>
<TE>   "It was worth it for him," his brother said.</TE>
<TE>   Sorensen had been taking care of his parents' dog while his mother
and father were on a cruise in Hawaii, celebrating their 50th
anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Sorensen saw the accident on the news and called his
brother's home several times Tuesday night, but there was no answer.
"It was unusual for him not to be home, since he was taking care of
the dog," Todd said, adding that the police reached his parents
first, who then called the rest of the family from the cruise ship.
"It is truly tragic."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Arts Center Names Major Donor Its Chairman</HD>
<DH>Music: Paul F. Folino, a technology executive, is praised
as a consensus- builder. The Costa Mesa facility had been rocked by a
lawsuit among its board members.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After six weeks of turbulence touched off by a lawsuit among members
of its board of directors, the Orange County Performing Arts Center
has moved to regain its equilibrium by naming as its leader a top
corporate arts donor.</LD>
<LD>   The center's board unanimously voted Tuesday to make Paul F.
Folino chairman designate, giving him three months to learn the
volunteer job from current chairman Roger T. Kirwan.</LD>
<LD>   Folino, who has led South Coast Repertory's board for the last two
years and spearheaded the Costa Mesa theater's successful
fund-raising drive, begins a three-year term July 16.</LD>
<TE>   Folino, 57, is president and chief executive of Emulex Corp., a
high-tech company based in Costa Mesa. The $10 million he gave to
South Coast Repertory is the largest donation in the history of the
Tony Award-winning theater.</TE>
<TE>   And as president of South Coast's board of trustees, Folino has
helped guide the theater's fund-raising campaign, which recently
passed its goal of $40 million and is now aiming for $50 million.
South Coast's expanded and renovated facility will be named the
Folino Theatre Center when it opens in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   David Emmes, South Coast's producing artistic director, on
Wednesday described Folino as a consensus builder. "I think he will
be a tremendous asset to the center at a time when they need it
most."</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Performing Arts Center also is trying to expand,
but its $200-million campaign to open a new symphony hall by fall
2005 has been stalled at $96 million for more than six months.
Raising the remaining money will be the most important challenge of
Folino's chairmanship.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great opportunity to help do something special ... an
opportunity to create a legacy that will last for decades to come,"
Folino said Wednesday. Folino, who has donated $1 million to the
center's expansion, was primed to join its board as a regular member.
His entry as chairman is the result of a chain of events that began
March 12, when news broke that two high-profile members of the
center's board, Broadcom Corp. partners Henry Samueli and Henry T.
Nicholas III, were being sued by a group of investors that included
several center board members.</TE>
<TE>   The suit stemmed from a stock investment gone sour, with
plaintiffs alleging that Broadcom had inflated sales and earnings
with improper accounting. It had nothing to do with the performing
arts center, but had great repercussions. The Broadcom partners, who
had given a combined $13.8 million to the center's expansion drive,
resigned from the board.</TE>
<TE>   They said that, although they would continue to support the
center's work, they no longer could serve alongside people they felt
were unjustly suing them for fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Among the plaintiffs was Thomas T. Tierney, the center's chairman
designate. On April 4, Tierney, a member of the center's board since
1986, announced he was stepping aside.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted the focus to be on building the center rather than
making judgments about my motivations in pursuing legal action on a
totally unrelated manner," Tierney said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Tierney, who remains on the center's 50-member board, said Folino
is "absolutely the perfect one" to become chairman. Kirwan said he
first approached other center board members about taking the job.</TE>
<TE>   "A few" qualified candidates declined because of business and
family commitments, he said, so he turned to Folino.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry E. Mandel, who oversees day-to-day operations as the
center's president, doesn't think the Broadcom lawsuit and its
fallout have cost the center donations, but he acknowledged that they
created "a kind of soap opera" that threatened to become a drag on
the center's efforts. The ideal coda to the Broadcom issue, Mandel
said, would be to quickly land some big donations signaling that the
expansion drive remains on course: "We need a couple of solid gifts
to say to the world we're moving on."</TE>

<HD>Ships Accused of Fouling Coast</HD>
<DH>Environment: Suit claims cruise lines illegally dump
ballast water, imperiling environment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four environmental groups filed suit on Wednesday charging that
luxury cruise liners are illegally discharging ballast water that
could damage plant and animal life along the California coast.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, says
the water sometimes contains exotic organisms that pose a threat to
native flora and fauna. Cruise ships take on the water in foreign
ports to maintain stability on the high seas and unload it elsewhere.
California enacted a law two years ago prohibiting dumping of ballast
water along its coast.</LD>
<LD>   "Cruise lines must stop fouling California's waters in the name of
good times and big profits," said Teri Shore of the Bluewater Network
in San Francisco, one of the plaintiffs in the suit.</LD>
<TE>   The suit alleges that five major cruise companies have committed
almost 500 ballast water violations along the California coast since
last summer. The violations allegedly occurred at ports in Long
Beach, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "The state pays a huge cost after these giant vessels dump
untreated ballast water into our ports without concern or penalty,"
said Jim Wheaton, of the Environmental Law Foundation in Oakland. "It
allows invasive aquatic species to take hold, ruining fisheries and
upsetting native ecosystems."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles and Long Beach are major cruise ship ports of call.
About 400 ships arrive to pick up 1 million passengers a year for
trips to Mexico, Canada and Alaska, according to the Marine Exchange
of Los Angeles-Long Beach Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   The companies named in the lawsuit are Carnival Corp., P &amp; O
Princess Cruises, Royal Caribbean, Holland America and Princess
Cruise Lines Ltd. Ships from those companies have made 698 trips into
California waters since January 2000, incurring 435 ballast water
discharge violations from the State Lands Commission, according to
the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the cruise companies could not be reached or
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Exotic species entering the United States pose a significant
environmental problem. Once turned loose here, they often have few
competitors or predators and can take over waterways, disrupting
native ecosystems and creating havoc for harbors and water treatment
and delivery systems.</TE>
<TE>   More than 230 nonnative plant and animal species have been
established in the San Francisco Bay and Delta. Control of these
species costs the nation millions of dollars a year.</TE>
<TE>   The groups Bluewater Network, Environmental Law Foundation, San
Diego Baykeeper and the Surfrider Foundation filed the suit.</TE>

<HD>Water in Lake Tahoe Gets Clearer</HD>
<DH>Environment: Experts say more improvement is necessary to
reverse impact of runoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Researchers announced on Wednesday that Lake Tahoe has achieved its
best clarity in five years, but cautioned that the battle has not yet
been won to reverse decades of decline in the alpine lake's
sapphire-blue waters.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists at UC Davis' Tahoe Research Group said a person could
see 73 feet into the lake's depths this year, a big jump from last
year when a white plate suspended from a line could on average be
seen at a depth of 67 feet.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Goldman, director of the research lab that has studied the
lake's waters for the last four decades, said clarity would have to
improve for at least another five years before scientists would feel
comfortable declaring a significant victory.</LD>
<TE>   "The long-term trend of clarity loss is still significant,"
Goldman said. "We've still got a lot more to do to reduce the impacts
of the average citizen on the lake."</TE>
<TE>   For generations, Lake Tahoe's famously clear waters have grown
dingier because of runoff in the fast-growing basin. Sediment clouds
the water, while chemicals, fertilizers and other pollutants promote
algae growth. In 1968, when UC Davis clarity studies began, the disk
could be seen at a depth of 102 feet.</TE>
<TE>   More than $900 million in state, federal and private funds has
been committed to curb erosion, restore wetlands and buy land to ease
the impact on the water.</TE>
<TE>   Although basin-restoration activities probably contributed to the
improvement last year, Goldman and other researchers also believe
that reduced runoff played a part in 2001, which was a drought year.
The worst recent year for lake clarity was 1997, a year of record

<HD>ETS to Take Over Testing</HD>
<DH>Education: The switch means the state will no longer use
the Stanford 9 to measure achievement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Board of Education on Wednesday voted to hire a new company
to administer the mammoth public school testing program, which has
often been marred by statistical problems.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-2 board vote authorized state officials to negotiate a $60-
million-per-year contract with Educational Testing Service, the
company that created the Scholastic Achievement Test college entrance
exam and the state's high school exit exam.</LD>
<LD>   ETS beat out three other bidders, including Harcourt Educational
Measurement, which has run the state testing since it began in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   The switch means the state will no longer use Harcourt's Stanford
9 exam, but Board of Education President Reed Hastings said that ETS
will offer tests that will not be significantly different. Hastings
said ETS was chosen because of the firm's wide experience and its
suggestions to improve the exam program.</TE>
<TE>   The state Standardized Testing and Reporting program, known as
STAR, is in the process of putting more emphasis on what students are
taught in California schools rather than on comparing their abilities
to youngsters elsewhere in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   While recommending ETS for the three-year contract, Supt. of
Instruction Delaine Eastin ranked Harcourt second. Eastin suggested
that Harcourt had gotten past the troubles that plagued its Stanford
9 test, especially early in the program.</TE>
<TE>   In the first year of the test, a demographic analysis of the
results was hampered by the lack of useful personal information about
students on about 18% of all the tests.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, about 300,000 fluent English speakers were
incorrectly classified as limited English proficient. Before it was
corrected, the error caused a stunning jump in the scores of the
limited English proficient, touching off exaggerated claims about the
benefits of Proposition 227, the state initiative that eliminated
most bilingual education.</TE>
<TE>   The Stanford 9 test has also been dogged by a dispute over the
cause of a dip that shows up consistently in the scores of
ninth-grade students across the state. Harcourt has always denied
that there is anything wrong with the test.</TE>
<TE>   Former school principal Nancy Ichinaga and the board's student
member Erika Goncalves dissented in the 6-2 vote. Ichinaga said she
empathized with some school district officials who said they wanted
continuity in the STAR program.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time the state board was considering the new contract,
a legislative assault on the state testing program passed a hurdle in
the Assembly education committee Wednesday after being somewhat
watered down by its author.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) initially sought to
scrap the testing program. But, after conferring with committee
Chairwoman Virginia Strom-Martin (D-Duncans Mills), Goldberg agreed
to amendments that would leave in place the portion of the test that
measures students' knowledge of the California standards and phase
out the portion that compares students nationally.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the bill would exempt students not proficient in
English from taking the test, and it would eliminate a requirement
that students pass the state's high school exit exam to graduate.</TE>
<TE>   The committee was still considering those amendments late
Wednesday, and the overall bill faces controversy ahead in the
Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   The state's mammoth testing program has been lauded as a keystone
of school reform. Reading and math scores have shot up under pressure
of the test, especially in the early years. In 2000, two-thirds of
the state's schools met growth targets imposed by the state. Last
year, statewide average scores continued upward, but at a slowing
pace.</TE>
<TE>   But the program also is criticized, especially by the powerful
teachers unions, as a flawed tool that forces teachers to drill
students on meaningless test-taking skills to attain artificial
improvements.</TE>

<CX>   Entrance exam: A story in Thursday's California section about the
state's selection of a new company to run public school testing
incorrectly identified the college entrance exam as the Scholastic
Achievement Test. The name of the College Board's test for higher
education is Scholastic Assessment Test, but is usually referred to as
just SAT.</CX>

<HD>Train Crash Increases Fear of Rail Traffic</HD>
<DH>Safety: Placentia officials hope to put tracks below street
level if they can raise $400 million in state and federal funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA and KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The deadly crash that killed two train commuters in Placentia has
amplified residents' concerns over the heavy rail traffic there--a
problem the Orange County city hopes to relieve by putting trains
into a trench below street level.</LD>
<LD>   A community of about 45,000 that grew up around its rail tracks,
Placentia feels the pounding effects of train traffic more than most
Southern California suburbs.</LD>
<LD>   Each day, Metrolink sends a dozen passenger trains down the
double-tracked rail corridor through the city. Burlington Northern
Santa Fe said it sends up to 60 trains a day along the same stretch
of track, which the freight line owns. Many residents say that number
is low.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Chris Lowe pointed to the large amount of waterborne freight
coming out of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach that goes
through Placentia. "I think the accident yesterday... underscores the
importance of finding a solution," Lowe said.</TE>
<TE>   11 Rail Crossings Were the Major Worry</TE>
<TE>   Until now, much of the concern in Placentia has been over the
dangers posed by cars and pedestrians mixing with locomotives at the
city's 11 rail crossings. The noise caused by the trains' horns also
disturbs many residents.</TE>
<TE>   Worried about noise pollution, Placentia officials are pressing
for the creation of a so-called quiet zone, meaning the trains would
have to lay off their horns when passing through the city except in
emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   Both Metrolink and Burlington Northern are involved in informal
discussions with the state Public Utilities Commission about the
noise issue. Though federal and state regulations require trains to
sound their horns at intersections, the two rail lines hope to be
allowed to follow the quiet zone proposal, said PUC spokeswoman Terri
Prosper.</TE>
<TE>   But Prosper said it is unlikely that the agency will exempt the
trains from sounding their horns. "We feel that, for safety, the
horns are needed," she said, although she noted that warning horns
would not have changed the outcome of Tuesday's deadly accident.</TE>
<TE>   As they wait to hear from the PUC, city officials have agreed to
spend about $5 million to install sturdier security gates and widen
medians at the crossings.</TE>
<TE>   They also plan to beef up traffic enforcement along the four-mile
train route, to discourage drivers from attempting to dodge trains.</TE>
<TE>   However, that would be just a short-term fix, Lowe said.</TE>
<TE>   As a long-range solution, Placentia plans to build a set of tracks
35 feet below street level. The $400-million project would be similar
to the recently completed Alameda Corridor, which has trains
traveling below ground level through six Los Angeles-area cities.
Placentia is seeking state and federal funding for that project.</TE>
<TE>   Two crossings--at Placentia Avenue and Melrose Avenue, in the
heart of downtown--would remain at ground level.</TE>
<TE>   But the city also has proposed spending $35 million to build an
underpass at each site for street traffic. Funding has already been
secured for those projects, and construction will begin in August.</TE>

<LD>Carol Fujita has spent vacations studying flying beetles the size of
a human fist. Craig Fox thinks it's fun to create computer games that
pose tricky transportation problems for would-be astronauts.</LD>
<LD>   That kind of curiosity and an ability to excite young people about
science have earned the two Ventura County educators top honors and
$10,000 each from one of the world's largest biotechnology companies.</LD>
<LD>   "These two are wonderful teachers who know science, have motivated
kids to learn and have taken their work to the next level by sharing
their practices with other educators," Amgen spokeswoman Barbara
Bronson Gray said.</LD>
<TE>   Fujita and Fox were two of five science teachers in the state who
won the Amgen Award for Science Teaching Excellence.</TE>
<TE>   Fujita teaches at Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard; Fox teaches at
Redwood Middle School in Thousand Oaks. Both winners will receive the

<HD>Your Teacher Wears Army Boots</HD>
<DH>Security: After five months of guarding Santa Barbara
Airport, Joe Berlin is looking forward to returning to his
fifth-graders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Joe Berlin's students could see him now, locked and loaded and
looking like a camouflaged warrior out of "Apocalypse Now," they
never again would give him flak about doing their homework.</LD>
<LD>   As a reservist with the California National Guard, the 52-year-old
fifth-grade teacher at Juanamaria Elementary School in east Ventura
spends his days patrolling Santa Barbara Airport with an M-16 slung
over one shoulder, police radios jangling from both hips and a black
beret propped at a menacing angle atop his bald head.</LD>
<LD>   He has been out of the classroom since before Thanksgiving, called
up as part of a massive deployment of National Guard troops in the
wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He is proud to do his duty,
sacrificing $750 a month--the difference between his teacher's pay
and Guard pay--to keep an eye out for unruly passengers and wayward
luggage.</LD>
<TE>   But right about now, he is starting to miss his old job.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss my kids, I really want to see them," said Berlin, who has
been told that his mission is winding down but is uncertain when it
will end. "The day they relieve me is the day I'll be back in the
classroom."</TE>
<TE>   At a time when employers have had to juggle work schedules to
accommodate military reservists called to active duty, Berlin is
believed to be the only public school teacher in Ventura County on
extended National Guard leave.</TE>
<TE>   School district officials in the county said they know of no other
case where a teacher has been on leave since the terrorist attacks,
although Fillmore High School has a part-time drafting teacher who
serves on his own time with the Guard at Oxnard Airport.</TE>
<TE>   That makes Berlin, the divorced father of two college-age
children, both a patriot and a pioneer.</TE>
<TE>   Confronted for the first time with such extraordinary
circumstances, Ventura Unified School District administrators took up
the prickly issue of whether to extend his salary and benefits beyond
the 30 days required by state law for public employees.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County government and a few local cities have made such
concessions for reservists on their payrolls. The school district
decided only to pick up the requisite 30 days' pay, but did extend
Berlin's health benefits for the time he is away.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had to make some adjustments," said Berlin, a Michigan
native who has been teaching for 22 years, the last four at schools
in Lancaster and Ventura. "But I'm not complaining. I knew the
obligation and I knew the rules when I signed up."</TE>
<TE>   Harder yet has been the time away from Juanamaria Elementary. The
school year was only a few weeks old when the terrorist attacks took
place. And by the time he was called up in November, he and his
students were just starting to click.</TE>
<TE>   He has only visited once since then, asked by his principal to
stay away because his presence caused a disruption.</TE>
<TE>   School district Supt. Trudy Arriaga said it is not that Berlin's
students didn't want to see him, but after he showed up the
substitute teacher had a hard time regaining control of the
classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had the opportunity to e-mail him and thank him for his
service," Arriaga said. "I appreciate what he's doing. I think he's a
real model for our community, giving of himself to serve our
country."</TE>
<TE>   The work is not glamorous.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin has been a guardsman for 17 years and had earlier been an
Army medic for two years.</TE>
<TE>   Now a sergeant and team leader with the 49th Combat Support
Command, Berlin oversees a crew keeping watch at Santa Barbara
Airport. They come from all walks of life and are among nearly 5,000
California guardsmen on duty performing homeland defense.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Berlin's eight-hour shifts have been uneventful. He faced
a bomb scare caused by a passenger who left a piece of luggage
unattended. He was in on a drug bust and has helped calm unruly
passengers simply by taking a step toward them. He even helped push a
Cessna with a flat tire off a runway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something, in the grand scheme of things, that is kind of
minor," he said of his airport service. "But it's a way that I was
able to contribute. People come up to me all the time and say, 'Thank
you, I'm glad you're here.' I always say I'm proud to do it."</TE>
<TE>   It's unlikely that he will do it much longer.</TE>
<TE>   The National Guard is wrapping up its tour of duty at regional
airports across the country, with soldiers scheduled to be relieved
May 10 by local law enforcement officers who in turn will be replaced
later this year by federal officers.</TE>
<TE>   It will take at least another week after that for the
guardsmen--more than 800 are stationed at 30 commercial airports
throughout the state--to be deactivated and resume their regular
lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of the Guard members who has been activated has sacrificed
in some way, with some leaving family and friends, some leaving their
jobs and some leaving the country," said California National Guard
spokeswoman Denise Varner. "What strikes me is that in every case
they are so proud to serve their country, that sacrifice becomes
secondary."</TE>
<TE>   At Santa Barbara Airport, patrol officer Jarrett Garcia said he
will be sad to see the soldiers go. But he will especially miss
Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good man," said Garcia, overseeing the same security area
last week where Berlin was watching passengers moving through metal
detectors. "In today's world, I think you need to have teachers like
Sgt. Berlin. I have two kids in grammar school and I'd love to have
him as their teacher."</TE>
<TE>   If he is lucky, Berlin could make it back to the classroom about a
month before the school year ends. It doesn't leave him much time to
reconnect with his students.</TE>
<TE>   But he plans to salvage what he can, using his time away as a
teaching tool.</TE>
<TE>   "I teach American history in the fifth grade," he said. "And I
feel like this is history in the making."</TE>

<LD>Orange County prosecutors are looking into whether a key player in
San Francisco's fatal dog mauling case may have committed several
Southern California rapes and slayings.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors confirmed Wednesday that they had won a court order
allowing them to take blood samples, by force if necessary, from Paul
"Cornfed" Schneider, a reputed leader of the Aryan Brotherhood prison
gang.</LD>
<LD>   Schneider, 40, is the inmate who raised the vicious Presa Canario
dog that killed Diane Whipple in the hallway of her San Francisco
apartment building.</LD>
<TE>   Schneider had bequeathed the dog to San Francisco lawyers Robert
Noel and Marjorie Knoller, who were convicted last month in the
mauling death.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County prosecutors are investigating whether Schneider was
the original "Night Stalker"--a nocturnal break-in artist who raped
and killed 10 people in Orange, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties
during the late 1970s and early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider fought an earlier attempt to draw blood evidence,
prompting authorities to seek a court order.</TE>
<TE>   The night stalker crimes that Schneider is suspected of committing
predated the night stalker killings committed by Richard Ramirez.</TE>

<HD>2 Local Science Teachers Win Amgen Awards</HD>
<DH>Education: They are among five in the state honored by the
biotechnology firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carol Fujita has spent vacations studying flying beetles the size of
a human fist. Craig Fox thinks it's fun to create computer games that
pose tricky transportation problems for would-be astronauts.</LD>
<LD>   That kind of curiosity and an ability to excite young people about
science have earned the two Ventura County educators top honors and
$10,000 each from one of the world's largest biotechnology companies.</LD>
<LD>   "These two are wonderful teachers who know science, have motivated
kids to learn and have taken their work to the next level by sharing
their practices with other educators," Amgen spokeswoman Barbara
Bronson Gray said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Fujita and Fox were two of five science teachers in the state who
won the Amgen Award for Science Teaching Excellence. The other
winners, all from a pool of more than 700, represent schools in
Woodland Hills, San Jose and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Fujita, a 53-year-old biological sciences instructor at Rio Mesa
High School in Oxnard, has been teaching for 18 years. She has spent
the last seven teaching Rio Mesa sophomores.</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard mother of one son became interested in science during
college. Since then, she has volunteered at dozens of entomology
exhibitions and crafted an advanced placement biology course for her
students.</TE>
<TE>   "It [science] is really neat stuff," Fujita said. "It's constantly
changing, and anyone can go outside and see insects and learn things
in the field."</TE>
<TE>   A former student now studying at a major university was one of
several people who nominated Fujita. Company officials won't reveal
who made the nominations but they do share details from the forms.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what it is about Mrs. Fujita that was so unique and
wonderful but I do know she has some sort of gift that enables her to
make even hissing cockroaches seem like the best thing," the former
student wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, who has spent 32 years at Redwood Middle School in Thousand
Oaks, remembers being excited about chemistry and physics as a boy.
Even today, the 56-year-old says most rooms in his Thousand Oaks home
are cluttered with ongoing science projects.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a scientist. I teach kids," said the father of two grown
sons. "I'm not trying to make the lab coat-and-glasses kind of nerd.
I just want people to understand the world and appreciate it."</TE>
<TE>   Fox is credited for creating several online science programs,
including the space simulation project used by students at schools
nationwide, including middle-school students in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   One of Fox's students said in a nomination form: "Every single day
when I walk into Mr. Fox's class, I know I will learn something new.
He takes science and makes you apply it to your life."</TE>
<TE>   Fox plans to share his winnings with his family and maybe travel
this summer. Fujita said she will donate $1,000 to a fund for
construction of a swimming pool for the school's athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Both winners will receive the cash awards at a dinner planned at
the California Science Center in Los Angeles May 9.</TE>

<HD>36 O.C. Schools Win State Award</HD>
<DH>Education: That number of Distinguished Schools tops all
counties. Two districts take six each.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three dozen Orange County schools won California Distinguished School
designation Wednesday, more than any other county, including far more
populous Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Among the awards were six each for the Capistrano and Saddleback
Valley unified school districts.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the highest number of distinguished schools we've ever
had," said Jerry Gross, Saddleback Valley superintendent. "Typically,
we only have two or three."</LD>
<TE>   Irvine Unified and Ocean View School District in Huntington Beach
won five each. For the small Ocean View district, that means
one-third of its schools earned the designation.</TE>
<TE>   "This validates the direction that we're heading--the direction
the state is going in terms of accountability of student
performance--and we support that," Ocean View Supt. James R. Tarwater
said. "We're jubilant."</TE>
<TE>   State education officials were unsurprised by Orange County's big
share of the awards, in part because its schools are more likely to
apply.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the districts like Capistrano and Saddleback submitted a
lot of nominees," said Carol Kennedy, consultant for the California
School Recognition Program, "and the school districts take a big role
in the application process rather than just leaving it up to the
individual schools, as in most other counties."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-four schools in Los Angeles County won the designation. San
Diego followed with 28 distinguished schools.</TE>
<TE>   The designation of schools as models of achievement is based on
such factors as test scores, curriculum, teacher performance, use of
technology and campus safety.</TE>
<TE>   The 247 distinguished schools were selected from more than 700
applicants.</TE>
<TE>   The California Distinguished Schools Program was established in
1985 and honors elementary and secondary schools in alternate years.</TE>
<TE>   First-time winners said the hard work of their students and
teachers paid off.</TE>
<TE>   "We were ecstatic when we heard officially this morning," said
Karen Merkow, principal of Anaheim Hills Elementary, where banners
and balloons decorated the school's front entrance after Wednesday's
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a one-year quick fix. It's been an ongoing process of
teaching the state-adopted standards and including parents in the
teaching process," said Merkow, who submitted an application that
included a 13-page essay with documentation.</TE>
<TE>   All California Distinguished Schools will be recognized May 24 at
an awards ceremony and dinner at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   The full list of distinguished schools can be found on the
California Department of Education's Web site at
www.cde.ca.gov/ope/csrp.</TE>

<HD>Budding Scientists Get Results</HD>
<DH>Fair: From the practical to the unusual, 1,200 projects
from county students are on display.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From experiments gauging the effectiveness of shinguards to taste
tests on tortilla chips and cat food, the 1,200 entries on display at
the 2002 Ventura County Science Fair offer a bit of the practical and
the unusual.</LD>
<LD>   Through tonight, projects exploring the role that music plays in
test performance, human heart rates and plant growth stand alongside
investigations into which brand of sneakers produces the highest
jumps and whether eyelash mascara is a health hazard. And if the
findings are less than earth-shattering, they are at least relevant.</LD>
<LD>   "My mother is always saying that you should sing the 'Happy
Birthday' song while you are washing hands to make sure you do it
long enough, and I wanted to see if she was right," said Tiana
Cortes, 11, an Oxnard fifth-grader whose entry examines the
relationship between bacteria counts and the time spent hand-washing.
According to the budding scientist, her inquiry yielded an important
lesson: Mother usually knows best.</LD>
<TE>   The annual rite of passage for scientifically inclined fifth-
through 12th-graders produced its usual share of esoteric
submissions, with titles such as "The Effects of Pollutants on Brine
Shrimp" and "Protozoa in Peril."</TE>
<TE>   But it was the less lofty projects that assured volunteer judges
such as Steve Chrans, an engineer at Northrop Grumman in Port
Hueneme, that the event is fulfilling its primary purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "What I find most refreshing is that while there are some kids who
are obviously very good at it, for others this is a way to bring
science to life," Chrans said. "There's one kid who obviously likes
riding BMX bikes off ramps. He probably does it every day after
school, and he turned that into a science project on aerodynamics."</TE>
<TE>   Students are competing for 25 prizes donated by private sponsors,
ranging from plaques and gift certificates to cash awards of up to
$500, and a $1,000 scholarship to Cal State Channel Islands. The top
three winners in each of the 16 categories also gain the right to
present their projects at the California Science Fair next month in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be cool to get a prize, but we came here for fun," said
Daniel Loman, 13, an eighth-grader at Ventura's Cabrillo Middle
School. He and teammate Sean Dalton, 13, both first-timers at the
fair, tested the performance of several alternative fuels in a
gasoline engine attached to a bicycle wheel.</TE>
<TE>   With a mother who is a former science teacher and an older sister
who is a former fair winner, Jon Rothstein-Fisch, a Ventura High
School senior, said he thought he might as well enter the show this
year, the last time he would be eligible.</TE>
<TE>   And waiting had its advantages. Because he is now 18,
Rothstein-Fisch had no trouble buying the cigarettes he and his
partner, Armond Richards, 17, needed for their research on whether
second-hand smoke is more harmful to children than adults.</TE>
<TE>   The pair used cotton balls and two different-sized plastic soda
bottles to simulate two sets of lungs, then fit the burning ends of
cigarettes into the bottle openings, and squeezed the bottles at
varying rates to simulate the respiration patterns of adults and
children. As they presented their findings to a team of judges, they
said their research was hampered because as nonsmokers they didn't
have any other way of obtaining second-hand smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "We for sure didn't want to put cigarettes to our mouths, because
we find them repulsive. But we do believe that the smoke coming out
of a human mouth would be cleaner than streamline smoke, because of
the filter," Rothstein-Fisch said. "At least that's our hypothesis."</TE>
<TE>   While the judges seemed impressed by scientifically sophisticated
entries such as 16-year-old Shavonne Thompson's study of antibiotic
resistance and eighth-grader Cassidy Hsieh's study of vitamin C in
vegetables, students themselves favored the more accessible entries.</TE>
<TE>   An exhibit that generated a lot of buzz examined how facial
symmetry relates to perceptions of beauty by analyzing photographs of
celebrities such as Britney Spears and Brad Pitt, who have fairly
symmetrical faces.</TE>
<TE>   The fair, at the Ventura County Fairgrounds, will be open to the
public from 2 to 6 p.m. today, with the winners scheduled to be
announced soon after.</TE>

<HD>Negative Study on Sewage Was Withheld</HD>
<DH>Environment: Grand jury says Orange County Sanitation
District didn't disclose to public for five years a report on water
quality off Newport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's largest sanitation agency has withheld sensitive
water-quality reports, including a study mapping an offshore sewage
plume that the agency did not disclose for five years, the county
grand jury said.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Sanitation District report, referred to as "The
20 Meter Study," found that partially treated waste water from a
controversial sewage outfall four miles off the county's coast washes
back to within 11/2 miles of Newport Beach--far closer than
previously disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Begun in 1996, the study was never seen by the public, although
part of it was made available to regulatory agencies. Newport Beach,
Huntington Beach and other coastal cities were not advised about the
study's findings.</LD>
<TE>   According to the grand jury's report, issued this week, "the
results were not published for over five years."</TE>
<TE>   The jury recommended releasing agency studies to the public in a
timely fashion, publishing study results, putting study topics on the
agency's Web page and providing public access to research data.</TE>
<TE>   The sanitation board, which met Wednesday night, was expected to
adopt the jury's recommendations, a spokeswoman said. Blake Anderson,
the agency's general manager, said in a prepared statement that
communicating with the public "is a high priority with this agency,
and we will use the recommendations to improve the way we disseminate
research studies to the community."</TE>
<TE>   While the agency did not comment on why it withheld the study, the
grand jury reported that the district is largely "self-monitored."
With the exception of regulatory agencies, it is "free to decide what
data or research to reveal to the [state water board] and the
public."</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury's report comes at a critical time for the
sanitation district, which operates under a waiver to the federal
Clean Water Act. That act requires at least secondary treatment of
sewage before it can be released into waterways.</TE>
<TE>   The waiver is up for renewal in 2003. Three coastal cities that
belong to the district have gone on record as opposing another
waiver, as have several inland cities.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Ken Maddox (R-Garden Grove) has sponsored a bill that
would kill the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox said his bill, AB 1969, cleared the Assembly's
Environmental Safety and Toxics Committee on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so surprising that they were so slow to release this
study," Maddox said. "But the taxpayers deserve a better explanation
than 'the dog ate my homework.'"</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalist Doug Korthof wasn't surprised by the grand jury's
findings. But he and other environmentalists had sought a stronger
reprimand from grand jurors.</TE>
<TE>   The agency, which bills itself as the "third-largest waste water
treatment system west of the Mississippi River," serves more than
2.2-million customers, primarily in central and northern Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury focused only on the agency's studies and what it
did with them; it did not choose to involve itself with the agency's
overall direction or policies.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not scientists," juror Kenda Marlin said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just saying that studying what's going on in the ocean is
important," she said. "And, if it's worth spending taxpayer money on
it, then it should be made available to the public."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors found that the agency has not disclosed the existence of
all publicly funded studies and has no written policies on report
preparation or distributing them when completed.</TE>

<DH>Santa Paula: Activists will discuss downtown revitalization
as an alternative to developing Adams Canyon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prompted by a developer's proposal to build nearly 2,000 homes in an
adjacent canyon, Santa Paula activists will hold a "smart growth"
conference Saturday to discuss alternative plans for the blue-collar
city.</LD>
<LD>   Event organizer Mike Miller is urging the city's 29,000 residents
to reject a proposal to build a suburb in Adams Canyon. Voters will
be asked to consider that plan in November.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, a mix of commercial and residential development should be
encouraged on vacant and underutilized lots around Main Street and in
neighboring Fagan Canyon, which is smaller than Adams Canyon, Miller
said.</LD>
<TE>   "People say there's so much potential here," said Miller, 37, a
marketing consultant who lives in a Victorian house downtown. "We're
suffering from 50 years of disinvestment in the downtown."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than build on hillsides and in canyons, Miller said it's in
the city's best interest to find creative ways to make downtown more
inviting to businesses and residents.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do it right," he said, "we can create the kind of dynamic
communities that people love--pedestrian environments where people
can live and work and recreate in the same place."</TE>
<TE>   The daylong conference at Santa Paula High School will feature
presentations by architects and developers who have used the "new
urbanism" concept in other California cities--from bungalow-chic
Pasadena to the smaller, largely working-class town of Hercules in
the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Not all city leaders embrace Miller's vision. City Councilman Rick
Cook, an advocate of Adams Canyon development, called the smart
growth conference a "pipe dream."</TE>
<TE>   The city lost its department stores and other vital businesses
after the oil industry pulled out three decades ago. As a result,
city finances are lagging, Cook said. Police and fire departments are
underfunded, streets need repair and the city has had little luck
attracting new employers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think those ideas are either for towns with a lot of money or
for new towns that are just starting," Cook said of the new urbanism
concept. "Until we can clean up our town visually and have enough
fire and police to protect our citizens, [investors] are not going to
come."</TE>
<TE>   Burke Farrar, founder of Pasadena-based Odyssey Development
Services, said Santa Paula has several elements that would make it
attractive to developers, including picturesque mountains and a Main
Street with striking architecture. "I think there's some great
potential," Farrar said.</TE>

<TE>   Some movies make better Broadway musicals than others. "Saturday
Night Fever" ... no. "The Full Monty"... yes. The hit musical comedy,
with music and lyrics by pop composer David Yazbek and book by
Terrence McNally, is based on the 1997 film about six unlikely male
strippers. It's still running on Broadway and in the West End, but
the start of this national tour is sort of a Southern California
homecoming: It got its start at the Globe Theatres in San Diego.</TE>

p.m. Regular schedule: Tuesdays through Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 2
