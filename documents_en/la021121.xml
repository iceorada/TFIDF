<HD>From a tiny acorn comes the mighty oak</HD>

<LD>Can you imagine an oak tree, 130 feet tall and with branches as big
and wide as a building's roof, growing from a little seed? This is
just what happens with an acorn, which is the seed of the oak tree.
You can hold an acorn between two fingers.</LD>
<LD>   Acorns are nuts with smooth shells and little caps on one end.
They start out green and in time become brown. As many as 50,000
acorns can grow on one tree each summer. They are a favorite food for
hungry squirrels, deer and other woodland animals. Because acorns are
so plentiful, there are always enough left over so new trees can
grow.</LD>
<LD>   Squirrels live in oak trees and are very busy this time of year
gathering and burying acorns so they'll have plenty of food during
the winter. But you know what can happen when you hide things --
sometimes they can end up forgotten. The same is true for squirrels.
Some of the acorns are left behind and stay buried in the soil.</LD>
<TE>   As months go by, acorns begin the job of becoming trees. They
start by breaking through their shells. Tiny roots grow down, deep
into the soil. A stem, with two little leaves, pushes up toward the
sun and begins to grow. Oaks don't grow fast, but they grow big and
they can live 500 years.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors at Descanso Gardens can see a 400-year-old oak. They can
walk through a forest of California live oaks that began as acorns
more than 100 years ago. Along one path there are 19 varieties of
native oak trees. These oaks have acorns that are different in shape
and size, but they all provide future trees as well as food and
habitat to many animals and birds. For more information call (818)
949-4200 or visit www.descanso gardens.org.</TE>

<LD>"My face was stinging. My nose was running. My ankles ached to the
bones.</LD>
<LD>   "Just as I scrambled up to make my way back to the warming house,
a snowball flew past me. I turned around. Oh, no! There were two boys
I knew from school. They were always causing trouble at school, and
at the park they were the ones whom Mr. Sonderquist called the
rowdiest.</LD>
<LD>   " 'Hey! There's goody-goody Gretchen,' one called.</LD>
<TE>   " 'Goody-goody Gretchen,' they sang out together. 'Let's get her!
We'll plaster her so thick with snowballs that she'll look like a
snowman. Goody-goody snowman!'</TE>
<TE>   "I wished Rolf and his friends would come and chase them away. I
wished I had listened to my mother and not gone skating that day. Who
wanted new figure skates anyway?</TE>
<TE>   "My eyes were wet. I'm not a crybaby, I told myself. The cold
weather is making my eyes tear. It can happen to anyone. I tried to
pull myself up tall and straight and moved along toward the warming
house.</TE>
<TE>   "Splat! A snowball hit my back.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Goody-goody ... '</TE>
<TE>   "Finally I reached the rail and grabbed hold of it. Step by clumsy
step I made my way up the wooden ramp.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt not only warm inside, but safe too. I was glad to smell
the wet wool and hear the hiss and sputter of the radiator. I pulled
off my skates, wiped the blades with a soft cloth and sat slumped on
the bench, my stocking feet on the radiator. I am never going ice
skating again, I promised myself."</TE>

<HD>A doctorate in DJ arts</HD>
<DH>The Institute of Mixology is a school without ivy for
wannabe turntablists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maria Elena Fernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is serious business, this school for future DJs called the
Institute of Mixology. The compact classroom is barely big enough to
contain a dry-erase board, two turntables and Elmar Diment, a burly,
techno-loving version of the nutty professor who has so many students
waiting to take his classes that he's created a home-study course.
That's because DJing is blowing up. At near-celebrity status,
top-notch DJs now charge anywhere from $40,000 to $100,000 for a
two-hour gig.</LD>
<LD>   In the past five years, a few DJ schools have cropped up in
Florida, New York and on the Web to serve wannabe DJs. Diment
probably led the pack when he founded the Institute of Mixology on
Melrose Avenue 10 years ago. "DJs are the rock stars of today," says
Diment, who moved the school to Sherman Oaks seven years ago. "It's
the trendy thing now to own a couple of turntables and do some mixing
and call yourself a DJ. For me, this is an art form."</LD>
<LD>   At the classroom he operates in a studio a few storefronts from
his vinyl record store, Groove Riders, Diment treats his turntables
like musical instruments. He teaches music theory and how to listen
for beats, harmonies and breaks, as students mix one song into
another.</LD>
<TE>   "I play the drums and consider myself a musician," Diment tells
his students on a recent Saturday. "But when you're playing an
instrument, you need the rest of the band to make a tune. You have
all the music right here, baby, underneath you fingertips."</TE>
<TE>   A Russian emigre who has lived in Los Angeles 11 years, Diment
learned to mix from master DJ Jelly Bean Benitez in New York City 15
years ago. When he moved to Los Angeles, he opened Beat Non-Stop on
Melrose, the first vinyl record store that catered to the club and DJ
culture by carrying equipment, club fashions and graffiti art. There,
Diment was struck by the idea of building six DJ booths with
turntables, mixers and speakers and calling the finished product a
classroom.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't the only one to see the need for schooling would-be DJs.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Burger, a veteran DJ deep in the wilds of Des Moines, helped
create the online DJ University in 1998, a free virtual classroom
that offers more than 100 classes. The site records an average of
50,000 hits a month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's helpful for people to find information and read up on what
more experienced people have done," Burger said. "You can learn
techniques from someone, but the business aspect of this you learn in
different ways."</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Knouse, a lover of trance, house and jungle music who owns
her turntables, turned to Diment to help her spin her hobby into a
money-making career.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like it's inconvenient to ask my friends to teach me, so
I'd rather pay for it," said Knouse, 29, of Redondo Beach. "It's also
been good for meeting promoters for different parties who can help a
woman start out in this industry."</TE>
<TE>   No longer a boys club, the class has more female students than
ever, Diment says. One of his best alumni, he says, was a 58-year-old
woman who taught him about trance music. His students average in age
from 18 to 40, but Diment accepts future DJs as young as 12.</TE>
<TE>   Diment's home-study course includes five instructional videos or
DVDs as well as exercise records for $100. The set will soon be
available at www.mixxandtrixx.com.</TE>

<HD>It's all about attitude</HD>
<DH>Rebels keep finding their way into Glen E. Friedman's
viewfinder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Keith Hamm</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>June 1977: With graceful aggression, skateboard legend Tony Alva
flies the finger as he pivots a backside edger on the lip of a
bone-dry swimming pool in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   August 1981: Sweating through tattered jeans, a bald Henry
Rollins, neck veins bulging, moves to the crushing chords of fellow
Black Flag band members Greg Ginn and Chuck Dukowski during a gig at
Costa Mesa's infamous Cuckoo's Nest.</LD>
<LD>   May 1987: Glaring from behind dark shades, rapper Ice-T owns
Sunset Boulevard in his maroon Porsche convertible.</LD>
<TE>   "Attitude and integrity tie these images together," photographer
Glen E. Friedman said with a sweeping hand toward the 37 images hung
in downtown Los Angeles' newest gallery, sixspace. "For me it's about
inspiring people, with integrity and rebelliousness."</TE>
<TE>   For the past quarter century, Friedman has been doing just that.
He became a published photographer in 1976, when he was just 12 years
old. That first shot, of pool-skating pioneer Jay Adams, ran in
Skateboarder magazine. Adams, Alva and the rest of Venice Beach's
groundbreaking Zephyr skateboarding team were featured in this year's
hit documentary, "Dogtown and Z-Boys," which Friedman co-produced.</TE>
<TE>   During the late 1970s, Friedman contributed frequently to
Skateboarder, focusing on the sweaty snarls and elegantly contorted
body positioning of bank- and pool-riding maneuvers. This penchant
for capturing attitude and fury lent Friedman a smooth transition
into his early-'80s documentation of punk rock bands.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman said he enjoyed the same comfortable accessibility with
emerging hip-hop acts a few years later, including Run-DMC, LL Cool J
and Beastie Boys, among others.</TE>
<TE>   "I skated, I went to shows all the time," he said. These
photographs show "my lifestyle too. And I just want people to see a
person's attitude."</TE>
<TE>   "His subjects are all people doing things he likes," added Caryn
Coleman, who, with her husband, Sean Bonner, owns and operates
sixspace, packed on a recent evening with an opening-night crowd. By
the '90s Friedman had created a weighty archive, capturing the
formative years of a lot of progressive underground talent. And he
had done so without selling out his subjects or compromising the
integrity of his vision. For example, many newspapers refuse to
publish the profane titles of two of Friedman's mid-'90s
skating/music photo books or the name of his current exhibition,
which premiered in 1997 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, and
has since been seen in Sydney, Tokyo, Rome, Berlin, Stockholm and
Chicago, among other cities worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   This current hanging, however, marks this exhibition's first
return home to Los Angeles. For the occasion, Friedman added a select
run of vintage skateboarding shots, fanning the surging nostalgia and
coaxing out a few of the early Dogtown crew, including Bob Biniak,
Paul Constantineau, Marty Grimes, Jeff Ho, Peggy Oki and Craig R.
Stecyk III. By 9 on opening night, followers were
shoulder-to-shoulder in Coleman and Bonner's 2,000 square-foot
gallery and at least 50 more were out front chatting and smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Stecyk, who mentored Friedman in the '70s and worked alongside him
on "Dogtown and Z-Boys," loved the scene, saying, "This show is a
serious effort trying to bring accessible work to an audience eager
to care about it."</TE>

<LD>An outpouring of love for Latino icons</LD>
<LD>   It was a busy weekend for Libreria Martinez Books and Art Gallery
in Santa Ana. Hundreds of visitors stopped by the store Friday night
and Saturday afternoon to meet two Latino icons with wildly different
followings: Isabel Allende and Renan Almendarez Coello, a.k.a. "El
Cucuy."</LD>
<LD>   Both drew crowds that waited for hours and lined a city block,
although Allende's fans were more reverential, more literary. Many
toted several volumes and seemed more interested in "The House of the
Spirits" and other titles than her latest, "City of Beasts," an
Amazon adventure story with a teenage protagonist that bookstore
owner Rueben Martinez compared to Harry Potter.</LD>
<TE>   Allende read excerpts from "City" before retiring to a back room
to greet a lengthy receiving line. Fans brought her roses and begged
for a few extra seconds to take snapshots with her. Mostly they
showered her with compliments in English and Spanish. A soft-spoken
young man in a T-shirt with pictures of llamas on it didn't say much
to get a few precious extra seconds with Allende; he simply leaned in
to kiss her cheek, then turned and walked away happily, as if just
touching her face was a brush with royalty.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning visitors began stopping by at 8 a.m., lining up
hours ahead of the scheduled 2 p.m. appearance by Coello, better
known as "El Cucuy de la Manana," a Spanish-language radio
personality who hosts a show filled with chat, silly skits and
inspirational messages.</TE>
<TE>   Coello's syndicated show, broadcast in Los Angeles (KSCA-FM 101.9)
and seven other cities, outdraws Howard Stern 2 to 1 and has been the
No. 1 radio show in Southern California for over two years. Coello
didn't read from his book, "El Cucuy de la Manana: My Life in Radio's
Fast Lane," which details his rise from a poverty-stricken youth in
Honduras, but fans seemed to understand his message.</TE>
<TE>   Coello made his way inside the store like a faith healer, reaching
out to touch anyone in his path. He took time to embrace and speak
with individual fans, and his signing lasted for hours. As he
caressed the cheek of a little girl in a wheelchair, tears began to
slide down her mother's face. His handlers took names and numbers of
fans who needed help. Despite a nickname that translates as
"boogeyman," Coello has a reputation for raising funds for charitable
causes in the U.S. and Latin America. Martinez predicts Coello's book
will make history as the first Spanish-language work to hit the New
York Times bestseller list. Fernando Schiantarelli, who wrote the
text, was more cautious, noting the book will be sold in unusual
venues. "This book will be sold in corner stores and grocery stores,
not just in Barnes and Noble. It will be the first and last book most
of these people buy."</TE>
<TE>   A middle-age woman with a mouthful of gold crowns and a yellow
plastic rosary finally got her moment. Coello spoke softly to her,
then gave her a goodbye pat on the top of her head; her hair was tied
in a topknot with a gauzy blue drugstore headpiece. "Que linda [how
pretty]," he said. She beamed like a beauty contest winner.</TE>
<TE>   -- Anne Valdespino</TE>

<TE>   A master of moodiness</TE>
<TE>   An unsettlingly raunchy crime caper, "Plainclothes Naked" (William
Morrow) is the down-and-dirty tale of a sex-obsessed crackhead, a
codeine-addicted cop and a murderous femme fatale. In other words,
quintessential Jerry Stahl.</TE>
<TE>   A premier writer of the sarcastic and disturbingly raw, Stahl's
mood was a perfect match for his new material at Skylight Books,
where a cult following of 25 or so fans had battled the hipster
hustle and bustle of Silver Lake on a Friday night to meet the man
capable of creating such compellingly deviant characters. Stahl,
however, seemed disappointed with the turnout.</TE>
<TE>   Displaying the dark humor for which he is famous, he thanked
everyone for coming: "I know it's a big television night," he said,
cracking the spine on his new novel to read a couple of segments. The
material drew titters and guffaws but Stahl, once again, seemed
disgruntled.</TE>
<TE>   "A massive nonseller, this book is," he said, putting down
"Plainclothes Naked" and moving on to "Permanent Midnight" -- his
critically acclaimed 1995 memoir that played the highs of his
television writing career off the lows of his various drug
addictions.</TE>
<TE>   More familiar with his earlier material, the audience rewarded him
with bigger laughs. Still, Stahl was determined to make a quick exit.
He grabbed his books from the podium and wandered off. When a
bookstore employee asked if he wanted to answer questions, he replied
with characteristic pessimism: "No one ever has any questions."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for his fans, Stahl's dour mood will, most likely,
yield more great writing in the future.</TE>

<HD>Love despite betrayal</HD>
<DH>'Crazy Drunk' gives audiences a taste of L.A. crime
history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Philip Brandes</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dark chapter from L.A.'s past -- the 1904 attempted-murder trial of
mining magnate and philanthropist Griffith J. Griffith (of Griffith
Park fame) -- is rescued from obscurity in "Crazy Drunk" at [Inside]
the Ford.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Fieldsteel's new drama explores the common threads in the
famous personalities and circumstances that left an indelible imprint
on the city when Griffith, after interrogating his wife, Tina, about
her supposed collusion with Pope Pius X, shot her in the head at
point-blank range.</LD>
<LD>   She survived, and her subsequent ambivalence toward Griffith is
among the episode's most intriguing puzzles. So intriguing, in fact,
that Griffith's celebrated defense attorney, Earl Rogers (Maury
Sterling), finds the human core of his case in "a love beneath the
logic of betrayal." In this case, Rogers pioneered the defense of
"innocent by reason of alcohol-induced insanity."</LD>
<TE>   The defense and the curious kind of love are as rooted in Rogers'
personal demons as in his client's. For all his brilliance (perhaps
because of it, Fieldsteel suggests), Rogers died an alcoholic,
tragically beyond the attempted intervention of his daughter, Adela
Rogers St. Johns (Alicia Wollerton), the columnist who later became
famous as the "Mother Confessor" to Hollywood celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   In well-matched casting, the secular concerns of Kevin Weisman's
Griffith clash with the devout Catholicism of Kara Zediker's Tina,
and the confrontation between Sterling and Wollerton at Rogers'
sanity hearing is heart-rending in depicting inadequacies of the most
loving intentions.</TE>
<TE>   Remaining faithful to historical circumstance constrains the
play's ability to explore its broader themes, requiring a stagy
overreliance on exposition at times. Matt Almos' energetic staging
for Buffalo Nights theater company effectively uses his performers to
enliven the narrative, and employs an abstract, highly stylized
presentation that slyly taps the mannered stiffness of the period. As
dramatizations of celebrity crimes go, "Crazy Drunk" far surpasses
its close theatrical sibling, "The Cat's Meow," inspired by an
incident in William Randolph Hearst's life.</TE>

<LD>Sims' City</LD>
<LD>   So you'da thought the Beatles were in the house. The wildly visual
art collective Mount Sims broke attendance records at the Echo in
Echo Park on Friday, with fans screaming along to DJ Matt Sims'
freaky electroclash sounds. With a pair of erotic dancers and
outrageous performance artists -- visualize naked people dancing with
speakers on their heads and lots of shaving cream -- Mount Sims can
climb every mountain.... Hanukkah rocks! Tel Aviv-based psychedelic
band Rockfour is plotting an eight-night Hanukkah residency at the
Knitting Factory, Nov. 29 through Dec. 6. B.Y.O.M. (Bring your own
menorah!) For a preview, you can see them tonight at the Derby in Los
Feliz ...</LD>

<TE>   Food and a flick</TE>
<TE>   Star chef Monica May (North/Smashbox) and her designer hubby,
Ricki Kline (North/Belly/Olive), are turning it out at Cinespace, the
new Hollywood Boulevard club opening above the Ivar in January. May
is plotting upscale versions of dinner-and-a-movie food. Think
homemade Cracker Jack with chocolate truffle surprises. Kline, who's
part of the Cinespace design team, is busy installing chandeliers in
the pinky fresh kitchen. Ooh la la.... Folks looking for a cool,
jazzy scene where they can still hear each other across the booth
should check out Canter's Kibitz Room on Wednesdays. The weekly jazz
cabaret's been keeping it real for 11 years running ...</TE>
<TE>   Had a nice chat with Rob Aston, singer in the gangsta punk
ubergroup the Transplants, which also includes Rancid's Tim Armstrong
and Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker. While his famous bandmates
finish up tours, Aston's recording a straight-up hip-hop record. When
you're hot, you're hot.... It's gonna be a Wavy Gravy time at the
Sunset Room tonight, as Algerian-born DJ Cheb I Sabbah and Ray
Manzarek channel India....  We hear those chicas locas, Cheap Chick,
are transforming Spaceland into a '70s-style arena rock show Nov. 30.
Dubbing it Cal Jam 3, Cheap Chick -- an all-girl Cheap Trick cover
band -- is promising plenty of beer bongs and bootleg T-shirts. Can
you dig?</TE>

<LD>Leaving the Best behind</LD>
<LD>   Six months after the release of a promising second album, the
indie rock band Sunday's Best has lost its drummer. Tom Ackerman, who
with Edward Reyes co-wrote the lyrics on "The Californian," has moved
on, saying the band was mired in an "inertial second gear," but
wishing the new lineup -- now including Gabriel Gamboa -- the best.
"I thought the potential was there for us to be a Death Cab for
Cutie, one of those indie bands that could sell 25,000 records,"
Ackerman said. "The only thing standing in our way was our own work
ethic." Ackerman, a former guitarist with Skiploader, has picked up
the ax again with his new project, the harder-edged Kite-Eating Tree,
which includes the three members of Hyphen.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Grounds for a hiatus</TE>
<TE>   After almost five years, singer-songwriter Wendie Colter is
putting her Third Thursday promotion on hiatus. "It was literally
like throwing a party for my friends once a month," Colter said of
the monthly vehicle for the pure pop crowd at Highland Grounds
coffeehouse. Tonight's lineup features, among others, Australian
power-pop quartet Starky and East Coast acts Cliff Hillis and Leisure
McCorkle. Colter's swan song will be December's holiday show.
Promoter Paul Rock will fill the monthly slot at the venue.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Single spotlight</TE>
<TE>   Suspecting that multiple-band showcases generate more confusion
than buzz, the folks at BMI are launching "Pick of the Month," a
session that focuses on one band. The picking starts with a free show
at 7 p.m. Monday at the Troubadour featuring Postfontaine, whose
California rock stylings first surfaced in the mid-1990s when
principals Emile Millar and brothers Mick and Thom Flowers founded
the Lapdancers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Briefly</TE>
<TE>   Underground Poets Railroad, a spoken-word/hip-hop tribute to
African American firefighters who died in the Sept. 11 attacks,
visits the Knitting Factory Hollywood tonight. The brainchild of
producers/directors Kip and Kern Konwiser (the HBO feature "Miss
Evers' Boys" is among their credits), the performances feature the
work of several hip-hop luminaries, as well as Southland poets such
as Sekou Tha Misfit, Gina Loring, Jerry Quickley and Jaha Zainabu....
Redd Kross' Steven McDonald got some ink when he added bass lines to
the songs on the White Stripes' "White Blood Cells" and posted the
tracks on the Internet. Now he's showcasing his own Steven McDonald
Group, which this week released an EP titled "This Is Not a Rebellion
..." and performs Friday night at Spaceland.... Also celebrating a
new record are brainy popsters Smart Brown Handbag. Their seventh
album, "Fast Friends," was released last month; the band plays
tonight at Molly Malone's.</TE>

<HD>Cut! It's time to rethink this</HD>
<DH>Zeta-Jones' decision to do commercials may be a
questionable career choice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Caro</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She was such a lovely actress, a stunner really, with a bright career
ahead of her until one dumb decision forever changed how we'll look
at her.</LD>
<LD>   How could she do it? How could she have been so short-sighted?
Don't these rich folks pay advisors to steer them away from such
self-sabotage?</LD>
<LD>   Honestly, she'd have been better off if she'd been caught
shoplifting or something. But no, Catherine Zeta-Jones had to make
those irritating cell phone commercials instead.</LD>
<TE>   Have you seen them? How could you avoid them?</TE>
<TE>   See the Welsh-born star walking among the little people, yelling,
"Cut!" to freeze them in their tracks like she's directing the movie
of life and they're just extras. See her provide divine inspiration
to these clueless folks, like, gee, if you had the chance to hang out
with a hot chick in Europe if only you could find someone to watch
your dog back home, you could reach the prospective dog-sitter with a
phone.</TE>
<TE>   See her snap her fingers, click her heels and shout, "Action!" so
these nobodies can complete their little dramas. The ads could be
scenes from a horror flick called "The Prom Queens Have Taken Over!"</TE>
<TE>   It's no mystery why the cell phone company hired the 33-year-old
actress to replace Jamie Lee Curtis. Zeta-Jones has been one of the
most desired actresses since Antonio Banderas took a saber to her
dress in 1998's "The Mask of Zorro."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Real magazine voted her the world's most
beautiful woman. She also was named the "ideal face of femininity"
for 2001 by the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgery, which cited her "short delicate jaw with small chin and
nose" plus "her lavish lips, well-developed cheek bones and prominent
eyes."</TE>
<TE>   After co-starring in the acclaimed "Traffic" and woeful "America's
Sweethearts" (which relegated Julia Roberts to the plain-Jane role),
Zeta-Jones took time out to have a baby. But now she's co-starring in
the upcoming "Chicago," the film adaptation of the Bob Fosse musical
that Miramax is positioning as its big Oscar contender.</TE>
<TE>   Why would Zeta-Jones want audiences (and academy members) seeing
her on screen and associating her with wireless communications?</TE>
<TE>   Zeta-Jones' agent at the William Morris Agency declined comment,
and because most folks in the movie business are averse to offending
those who might contribute to future paychecks, critiques for
attribution are rare. But no one I called thought Zeta-Jones was
displaying brilliant judgment; one person associated with "Chicago"
called the ads "an extraordinarily bad career move," "cheesy" and a
potential turnoff to some of the movie's viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "There's less and less stigma with A-list talent doing television
series and commercial spots, but you need to choose carefully and
consider the volume of sheer exposure," said an agent at a rival firm
to William Morris. "When the women do all of the cosmetic ads, those
make sense, and I don't mind seeing Halle Berry's face a zillion
times for Revlon because she's beautiful and it works, makes sense.
The cell phone thing, I don't get it."</TE>
<TE>   Reports have Zeta-Jones getting paid a minimum of $1 million for
her two-year ad deal, which would be a lot of money to most of us but
seems a bargain for someone who could command eight-figure paychecks
if she could cement her movie bankability. Plus, she's married to
Michael Douglas, so that household isn't hurting.</TE>
<TE>   Note that you haven't seen Roberts or Reese Witherspoon or Sandra
Bullock or Nicole Kidman (or Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks) doing massive
commercial campaigns in this country. Mega stars are mega because you
want to spend $9 to see them on the big screen. If you can see them
six times a night on TV, why bother? (This is why many TV stars have
trouble crossing over to movies.) Meanwhile, David Arquette is
struggling to be taken seriously after his series of obnoxious phone
ads.</TE>
<TE>   "It absolutely does devalue them," the "Chicago" person said of
the ads. "Let's face it: That scarcity and mystery are part of what
makes a movie star alluring."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Chris Pula, former marketing chief for Warner Bros.,
Disney and New Line, questioned whether Zeta-Jones has proven herself
a true movie star.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how talented she is," Pula said. "What hits has she
done that are due to her? I'm sure she brought a younger audience to
'Entrapment' [the 1999 thriller with Sean Connery]."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the phone gig is just part of Zeta-Jones' quest to become
the anti-Sandra Bullock by taking only unsympathetic parts. She was
dislikable in "High Fidelity," "America's Sweethearts" and "Traffic,"
she plays a murderess in "Chicago" and she'll be a gold digger in the
upcoming Coen Brothers movie "Intolerable Cruelty."</TE>
<TE>   Still, at least one of my colleagues found himself won over by the
ads.</TE>
<TE>   "You know why I don't find them irritating?" he asked. "Because
she's fine as hell."</TE>

<LD>People are weird. They lie. They cheat. They pretend to be something
they're not. No wonder there are so many botched and bungled
relationships in this world. People are just a messy bunch to figure
out.</LD>
<LD>   "So many [individuals] misread others, and their mistakes in
judgment cause them a lot of suffering," said Deanna Foster, a
Beverly Hills psychologist and executive coach who teaches the
sounds-too-good-to-be-true bimonthly course "How to Read Anyone in 30
Seconds."</LD>
<LD>   "Especially in Los Angeles, some people come off in ways that
convey themselves in the most positive manner, disguising what their
true intentions are."</LD>
<TE>   Whether it's distinguishing a fox from a wolf in a romantic
situation or, in a professional environment, figuring out which face
is real when a co-worker appears to have two, Foster said a number of
"quick and dirty strategies" can be used to assess people more
accurately.</TE>
<TE>   On a basic level, she helps students to read others' body language
and listen to their own intuition. But first, she teaches them to
clear their biases. There's a reason why some people end up having
"Groundhog Day" relationships, attracting the same personality types
again and again. They're bringing their own emotional baggage into
the mix, and it's clouding their ability to see others with an open
mind.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, reading someone in 30 seconds is not about snap
judgments, Foster said. It's about "looking for a few key things and
using them to make some quick determinations."</TE>

<DH>The Icelandic quartet Sigur Ros speaks its own language but
has no trouble connecting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Cromelin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are advantages to singing in a language of your own invention.
For one thing, if you blow a lyric during a show, who's going to
know? You're also immune to critical carping about not making sense
or being cliched. And these days you're not even isolating yourself
in a remote corner, not when there's a substantial audience in the
U.S. that enjoys music sung in strange tongues -- Salif Keita in
Malinke, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan in Urdu, Bob Dylan in English.</LD>
<LD>   That crowd, crossing art-rock, world-music, trance-dance
college-rock and exotica borders, filled the Wiltern on Tuesday to
bask in the enveloping sound of the Icelandic quartet Sigur Ros. And
singer Jon Thor Birgisson certainly didn't need recognizable words to
connect with his listeners on the first of the band's two nights at
the theater.</LD>
<LD>   The message was entirely in the gripping urgency of his unique
singing -- a sharp, intense keening that resides at the outer edge of
the vocal atmosphere. Sometimes his syllables almost sounded like
something familiar -- "inside" or "you slide," "Yes I ... I'm down,"
"shine on our fire" -- but essentially they functioned as a sort of
celestial, slow-motion mantra.</LD>
<TE>   It was the focus of a series of grand musical tableaux, several of
them drawn from the group's recently released second U.S. album,
whose title is a symbol that looks like a set of parentheses and
whose songs have no titles at all. (That's one way to discourage
audience requests; no one shouted "Track 5!" Tuesday.)</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two hours of this can be demanding, but the tendency of the
mind to wander (or shut down entirely) diminished as the pace and
power gradually picked up. Commentaries about Sigur Ros invariably
cite the sound as a reflection of the rugged, mysterious beauty of
their homeland, and while that might be a stretch, you certainly
wouldn't say the Bahamas if asked to guess where this music
originates.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the pieces began with a stately motif, often from Kjartan
Sveinsson's piano or Georg Holm's bass, then grew inexorably in
density and intensity. Birgisson played his guitar with a bow most of
the time, thickening the brew, and at one point he held the guitar in
front of his face and sang directly into the instrument's electric
pickups.</TE>
<TE>   Holm created sonic clouds by strumming chords on his bass, and on
one song he tapped out a riff on his strings with a drumstick,
leading into an almost bouncy song reminiscent of Peter Gabriel. A
four-woman string ensemble called Amina added to the texture, and
drummer Orri Pall Dyrason pummeled like a rocker, sometimes leading
the band into a fearsomely prodigious attack.</TE>
<TE>   The closest comparison in mainstream rock might be Radiohead,
whose endorsement helped bring the group into the non-frozen world a
couple of years ago. The outline of that emergence might sound
arbitrary, the product of some lucky connections, but Sigur Ros'
performance argued that anything this doggedly original and powerful
would inevitably find its following, far and wide.</TE>

<LD>   Graham Greene on screen</LD>
<LD>   In 1952 Vietnam, a country fighting for its independence from
French colonial rule, triangulated romance and political intrigue
coalesce around a murder in "The Quiet American." An idealistic U.S.
aid worker arrives in Saigon and is soon befriended by a British
journalist and his beautiful mistress, setting in motion a series of
revelations leading to betrayal. Brendan Fraser, Michael Caine and Do
Thi Hai Yen star in Robert Schenkkan and Christopher Hampton's
adaptation of the Graham Greene novel, directed by Phillip Noyce.</LD>
<TE>   "The Quiet American," rated R for images of violence and some
language, opens Friday in selected theaters.</TE>

<TE>   'Solaris' but not Soderbergh</TE>
<TE>   Arriving five days ahead of a new Steven Soderbergh-George Clooney
version, Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 science fiction classic "Solaris"
begins a one-week run at the Nuart. Based on the novel by Stanislaw
Lem, the Tarkovsky film goes metaphysical with a psychologist who is
sent to a space station orbiting the title planet, where he discovers
the crew suffering from a dementia that feeds on their obsessions and
repressed memories. The complete version of the oft-bowdlerized film
screens from a new 35-millimeter print.</TE>
<TE>   "Solaris," unrated, opens Friday exclusively at Landmark's Nuart,
11272 Santa Monica Blvd., West L.A., (310) 478-6379.</TE>

this year to the great outdoors at the Coliseum to accommodate a
European-style general-admission festival ambience. The daylong
show's lineup on Saturday swings from hip-hop bands Cypress Hill and
Kottonmouth Kings to the old-school supercharged punk of the Circle
Jerks and newer-school Face to Face, to rappers Snoop Dogg and
Redman, to the crushing sonic assault of the hard-rock group Mudvayne

<TE>   DANCE</TE>
<TE>   Across the spectrum of style</TE>
<TE>   Dances of less than 10 minutes in length. Sixteen Southland
companies. Every style from commercial to classical, and every kind
of choreographer from newcomers to such well-known touring honchos as
Joe Goode. Put all these factoids together and there's just one
possible conclusion: It's time for another edition of Spectrum: Dance
in L.A., a now-quarterly showcase produced on a shoestring by the
tireless Deborah Brockus and Daisy Kim. "Spectrum #13" will feature a
new Goode solo for the spectacular Patrick Damon Rago of the Tongue
company; an attempt by Janet Roston to merge ancient Indian dance
with contemporary hip-hop; works by Ruby Karen and Ken Morris for
Brockus' own company; authoritative ballet from Stefan Wenta; and
trenchant modern dance from Benita Bike. Should any of these pieces
disturb or bore you, don't worry: In just a few minutes you can
expect to be charmed and entertained by Jessie Abrescy, Rei Aoo, Bob
Boross, Corey Burrell, Anna Djanbazian, Rande Dorn, Scott
Heinzerling, Erin Landry, Denise Leitner and Hillary Thomas.</TE>

during his college years at Harvard; maybe that's why he chose to
portray changes in Americans' perception of their national character
by examining a variety of archetypal film characters in his 1977
musical comedy, "A History of the American Film." An onstage pianist
will provide the accompaniment--a first for the storefront Chance
Theater, which has used tapes in previous musical outings.</LD>
<TE>   "A History of the American Film," Chance Theater, 5576 E. La Palma
Ave., Anaheim Hills. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends
Dec. 22. $15-$18. (714) 777-3033.</TE>

<HD>Sidemen eclipse Tyrell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Tyrell spent decades in the music business as a producer and an
executive before he decided to step out on his own as a singer. His
resulting two albums (with a third, a holiday CD, about to be
released) have reached consistently high positions on the jazz
charts.</LD>
<LD>   And that's a bit perplexing, since his performance at Catalina Bar
&amp; Grill on Tuesday had a lot more to do with rhythm &amp; blues, Dean
Martin and Dr. John than it did with, say, Joe Williams or Mel Torme.
The jazz quotient for the evening, in fact, was largely provided by a
seven-piece band that featured two authentic jazz artists --
trumpeter Lew Soloff and tenor saxophonist Plas Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   Although each was confined to relatively short solo segments, what
they had to say was first-rate, with Soloff dipping into his youth to
revisit his Louis Armstrong/Roy Eldridge dreams, and Johnson, as
always, applying his rough-hewn sound and visceral sense of swing to
both ballads and rhythm tunes.</LD>
<TE>   To his credit, Tyrell frequently expressed his delight about being
in such stellar company. His own modest jazz skills, however, were
centered primarily around his loose, loping rhythmic phrasing and a
selection of songs -- "On the Sunny Side of the Street," "I'm in the
Mood for Love," "It Had to be You," among numerous others -- that
have long been staples of the jazz repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   But his relatively limited interpretive abilities, the
monochromatic quality of his sound and the repetitiousness of his
phrasing soon tended to dull the impact of even this fine material.</TE>
<TE>   Tyrell's success owes more to heavy promotion and the paucity of
new male jazz vocal talent than to his own skills. Given a few more
years of seasoning, his singing might come to justify the attention
it's received.</TE>

<HD>Fiery memories of ice</HD>
<DH>Lake Arrowhead's new outdoor skating rink causes a father
to look back -- and to the future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Duane Noriyuki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sounds of skate blades gliding and biting into the ice travel
from afar, through space and time. They remind me of Colorado,
childhood and a frozen pond where cottonwoods grew, a world of
magpies, frogs, carp and catfish. I was 9 or 10, cold, and my ankles
were wobbly. I have no recollection of grace or speed. I did not
glide eagle-like -- chest puffed out, wings extended -- soaring and
looping through frigid air. There were no spectacular leaps,
crescendos or clashing cymbals to my movements, unless you consider
my falls. What I recall, mostly, is the sky.</LD>
<LD>   Skating for me was a process of brattling along, scraping the ice
in short, uneven strides, legs bowed one second, knock-kneed the
next. Much of my time was spent with my back upon the ice, snowflakes
dancing all around me as I gazed up into winter's grayness.</LD>
<LD>   On sunny days, when the air seemed crystalline, fragile somehow,
the sky was an endless blue, and the sounds of skates all around me
seemed louder than usual as they joined with laughter, calamity and
the heaving in my chest. I hear them now as I observe preparations
for a new rink on the shore of Lake Arrowhead next to the village.
Ice skating, like baseball, is more wonderful when performed in the
outdoors, where sounds do not bounce off cinderblock walls and
rafters do not replace stars.</LD>
<TE>   It is even more wonderful in the mountains, where I live and where
in winter there is snow, or the promise of it, as well as evergreens
and the mingling scents of wood smoke and cider. It is a place with
four distinct seasons, unlike most of Southern California, and winter
may be my favorite of them all. It is a community known for ice
skating, home to the Ice Castle International Training Center, where
Olympians, including Michelle Kwan, have trained. Of late, however,
there has been no place for the rest of us, those whose aspirations
do not point toward bronze, silver or gold but merely to a cup of hot
cocoa. The roof of our public rink collapsed under the weight of snow
in February 2001 and was not rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   So it is with a sense of celebration that public outdoor skating
returns to Lake Arrowhead, in the San Bernardino Mountains about 90
miles from Los Angeles. It comes with a price, however. A 45-minute
session costs $7 for adults and $5 for children 6 and younger. Skate
rentals are $3.</TE>
<TE>   The pond of my childhood was free. If it had a name, I can't
recall it. I went there with my brother, sister and friends and took
particular delight in slinging rocks across the surface of the ice to
see how far they would glide.</TE>
<TE>   Later in life, I remember watching my wife and oldest daughter,
now 21, skate hand-in-hand one night at an outdoor rink in Steamboat
Springs, Colo. It was after a day of skiing and remains as precious a
memory as I have.</TE>
<TE>   At this new rink, I hope to watch my wife skate with our youngest
daughter, who is 4 and anxious for all that is new. This will be her
pond, the one she will remember, perhaps, years from now just as I
remember mine. Perhaps she and I will skate together and lie with our
backs upon the ice, gazing at snowflakes or stars or a deep blue sky
as we listen to wintry sounds. And feel the heaving in our chests.</TE>

<HD>From BBC to the USA -- without the accent</HD>
<DH>Transferring British comedies to American TV may require a
bit of adjusting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Two popular BBC comedies, "The Office," and "Manchild," may soon be
crossing the Atlantic, part of a trend-of-the-moment that started
with imported British reality shows and is now extending to scripted
series.</LD>
<LD>   "The Office," BBC2's hit dead-pan comedy about daily life at a
stationery company, is being looked at for an American remake by
Universal Television's USA Networks. In an interview with Britain's
the Guardian on Monday, Universal Television Chairman Michael
Jackson, a former controller at BBC2, said he wants to transfer the
show to the U.S. The show, shot in the style of a documentary,
revolves around the politics, romances and mundane goings-on at the
office and airs without a laugh track.</LD>
<LD>   Some U.S. TV executives have already expressed reservations about
whether Americans would go for its offbeat style. A Universal
spokesman said there is no deal yet for a U.S. outlet to pick up the
show.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, ABC said it is looking at an American version of
"Manchild," a male "Sex and the City" about four men in midlife
crisis. The network has asked for a script but no pilot, as yet. The
British version has aired on BBC America.</TE>
<TE>   USA Networks recently shot a pilot for an American version of the
racy British sitcom "Coupling" for NBC. Jackson told the Guardian:
"It's the classic problem. The network buys it because they love it
but then gradually the pressure comes to make it more of a gag-fest
and less of a farce. And the challenge is to stop that happening."</TE>
<TE>   NBC has also ordered a pilot of an American remake of the BBC's
"The Kumars at No. 42." The show will be retitled "The Ortegas."</TE>

<LD>   Fluffy Bunnies in a Field of Daisies: Dating -- eeeewww. Like "I
Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change," the off-Broadway musical
revue, and "Maybe Baby, It's You," "Fluffy Bunnies in a Field of
Daisies" examines attractive young heterosexuals who have nothing to
do but agonize over sex or the lack thereof. The screamingly funny
new comedy written and directed by Matt Chaffee at Hollywood's Zoo
Theatre, hops close to the edge of desperation, sending up, rather
than reveling in, sitcom platitudes. Outsized happy rabbits loom over
the set, but these "fluffy bunnies" frolick not among daisies but
among landmines.</LD>

<HD>China breaks out</HD>
<DH>UCLA archive presents edgy films that couldn't have been
made as recently as 10 years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scarlet Cheng</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the 1950s, filmmaking in China has been clamped in the vise of
communist censorship, and predictably sanitized and politically
correct fare has been the order of the day. Recently there has been
not just a trickle but a surge of feature films from that country
that would not have been possible 10 years ago, as the "New Chinese
Cinema" series from the UCLA Film and Television Archive
demonstrates.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the eight films featured in the series, which opens
Saturday, are daring for their deviation from political orthodoxy,
such as Jiang Wen's reexamination of the Chinese under Japanese
occupation in "Devils on the Doorstep" or Hu Ze's chronicle of
rebellious artists in "Beijing Suburb." Others push the envelope in
their inclusion of sexual themes, whether frank heterosexual
depiction as in Emily Tang's "Conjugation" or extreme ones in the
vignettes of transgender tease in Cui Zi'en's "Enter the Clowns."
Co-curated by the archive's head programmer, Cheng-Sim Lim, and by
CalArts faculty member Berenice Reynaud, the series is not a
comprehensive survey of current Chinese cinema, which certainly
includes its share of fluff and box-office pandering, but a look at
its edgier efforts.</LD>
<TE>   These efforts are possible because the traditional studio system
has broken down, and independent filmmakers have found ways to make
films through co-production, foreign funding, shooting without
licenses and other circumventions. And finally, in the past year, it
is possible for independent production companies to apply for
filmmaking licenses in China, although their projects are still
subject to government script approval.</TE>
<TE>   To remain free of such constraints, Reynaud says some filmmakers
prefer to stay "underground," such as those behind "The Orphan of
Anyang," "Beijing Suburb" and "Enter the Clowns." These touch on
still-forbidden topics such as police repression and corruption,
prostitution, homosexuality and transsexualism, or unemployment in
the new economy.</TE>
<TE>   The understated but compelling "The Orphan of Anyang," for
example, opens with a middle-aged man facing unemployment after being
laid off by an unprofitable factory. To make ends meet, he decides to
look after an infant in exchange for a stipend offered by the child's
mother, a downtrodden prostitute. For one happy moment, it looks as
though a new family unit is about to be formed -- until the child's
father, a gangland boss, decides he wants his son.</TE>
<TE>   Like other unlicensed productions, "Orphan" cannot be distributed
theatrically in China, so director Wang Chao has publicly said he can
give away free DVDs of the film to anyone who wants to see it.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, two of the veteran filmmakers in this group, Jiang
Wen and Tian Zhuangzhuang, have used the traditional Chinese literary
device of looking backward to address the present. "Springtime in a
Small Town" is Tian's first film since he was officially blacklisted
for "The Blue Kite" (1993), about the excesses of the Cultural
Revolution as seen through the eyes of a young boy. Authorities found
it overcritical of government policy.</TE>
<TE>   "Springtime" is classical, and Tian uses mostly unknown young
actors to weave this graceful, bittersweet tale of love lost and
gained. A remake of Fei Mu's 1948 masterpiece, the new film is a
throwback to the composed, postwar Chinese melodramas. Zhichen
returns to a bombed-out village to revisit his old friend Liyan --
who happens to have married Zhichen's childhood sweetheart, Yuwen.</TE>
<TE>   Soon Yuwen finds herself torn between her Confucian obligation to
her sickly, conservative husband and her heartfelt yearning for
lively, progressive-thinking Zhichen, fresh from big-city Shanghai
and dapper in his Western suits.</TE>
<TE>   A birthday celebration becomes the excuse to unleash repressed
emotions -- and Zhichen makes a public play for his old flame. That
night Yuwen comes to his room, ready to take him up on his
flirtation. The subtext is the tug between the old society and its
stifling feudalism and the new society and its promise of free will
and individual choice -- but here the results are something of an
impasse. (See Screening Room on the next page for Kevin Thomas'
assessment of "Springtime in a Small Town.")</TE>
<TE>   "Devils on the Doorstep" takes place in a remote northeastern
village under Japanese occupation in the 1940s. The villagers and the
foreign troops coexist peacefully -- already an unorthodox depiction;
a more traditional film would have shown the Japanese as bloodthirsty
demons. The movie opens on a tone of broad comedy when two prisoners
are thrown into the house of Ma Dasan (played by Jiang Wen himself)
for safekeeping by a shadowy figure. This bit of skulduggery
initiates a cycle of secretiveness and jailer mentality that the
villagers aren't equipped for -- and ultimately leads to a tragedy of
epic proportions.</TE>
<TE>   The work is hailed as an "antiwar masterpiece" by Reynaud, who
believes "it shows that there are no winners in a war. In a war
everybody loses."</TE>
<TE>   "Devils" premiered at Cannes two years ago and won the Grand Prix,
but the film was subsequently banned in China. Jiang himself has been
blacklisted from making any more films, but he has managed to
continue his acting career.</TE>
<TE>   As young filmmakers do everywhere, those in China tend to focus on
the problems of their own generation. In "Conjugation" Tang looks at
the growing malaise of a group of students after Tiananmen Square in
1989. Haunted by the fact that one friend has gone "missing"
(probably killed or jailed), they halfheartedly go through the days
thinking up moneymaking schemes and drinking way too much. Soon love
and friendships fall apart.</TE>
<TE>   Discontent also underlies the protagonist of Wen Hai's "Beijing
Suburb," an artist who creates large expressionist canvases "about
how people torture one another" for himself and the occasional "Van
Gogh" sunflower on commission. He's also into performance art, and in
one private performance, he stands onstage in the airplane position
-- bent over, arms stretched up behind him, a position those punished
during the Cultural Revolution were forced to take -- while a
comically lackadaisical chorus sings a popular children's song. The
refrain -- "Our homeland is a garden with colorful flowers. We are
under warm sunshine with a smile on everyone's face. Wahaha, Wahaha
... How happy our life is!" -- drips with cold irony. Then
authorities arrive to arrest him -- for lack of a residence permit.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in reality, art shows have been shut down and artists
arrested for producing "subversive" work, with subversive broadly
defined. While slowly paced, the film would be of interest to anyone
who wants to know the particular struggles of contemporary artists in
China -- who are, not surprisingly, a macho bunch of guys, into tough
talking and hard drinking.</TE>
<TE>   But lest we forget that China is still predominantly rural and
agricultural, the series includes Ning Ying's "Railroad of Hope," an
unexpectedly moving film that is also the sole documentary in the
series. Her narrative films ("On the Beat," "I Love Beijing") have
often had the matter-of-fact feel of documentaries, and here she
demonstrates her narrative gifts in an actual one.</TE>
<TE>   Every year in August and September thousands of Sichuan peasants
squeeze onto overcrowded trains to take a 50-hour trip to Xinjiang,
where they have been promised short-term jobs that net them a small
fortune. Ning Ying and her crew interviewed about a dozen men, women
and children en route about their expectations and their aspirations.
The lucky ones have seats; the less fortunate are crammed into the
aisles and passages.</TE>
<TE>   Each story is remarkably direct and poignant, as when one woman
reveals that she was deceived into marriage with a much older man she
is traveling to meet. Is she happy now? "You can never be happy when
you've been deceived," she says, the smiling voice breaking into
grief.</TE>
<TE>   Another interviewee, a middle-aged peasant, when asked what
happiness is, replies with clarity, "Autonomy ... not being looked
down on by others, not being afraid to be bullied, living honestly
and in dignity, even modestly working hard to support oneself, all
this can be happiness." His calm, resilient attitude goes far in
explaining what makes it possible for thousands, millions of Chinese
who continue to work so hard for what may seem to us sub-minimal
standards of living.</TE>
<TE>   His words ring with conviction when he says, "The most important
things in a man's life are to be alive, to have ideals."</TE>

<LD>The chronicles of Chinese filmmakers and their bouts with censorship
are ongoing -- the central government's Film Bureau still bans frank
sexual depictions and political sentiments it deems incorrect.</LD>
<LD>   Probably more surprising is how filmmakers continue to work under
the system.</LD>
<LD>   At Cannes in 1993 noted directed Chen Kaige won the Palme d'Or for
"Farewell My Concubine" (along with Jane Campion's "The Piano"), a
tale of modern Chinese history as refracted through the lives of two
close friends.</LD>
<TE>   As stars of the Chinese opera, they enjoy their ups and then,
during the Cultural Revolution when many artists and performers were
considered decadent, suffer their public humiliation.</TE>
<TE>   The Palme was the most prestigious award won by a Chinese film up
until then, but back in China, the Film Bureau demanded cuts.
"Farewell's" Hong Kong-based producer, Tomson Films, which
desperately wanted the film released in China, negotiated and, in the
end, made three snips.</TE>
<TE>   Chen himself has refused to see the mainland version of the film,
but reportedly the cuts included an embrace between two men
(homosexual implications) and any reference that one character kills
himself after the Cultural Revolution (read as a criticism of the
current regime).</TE>
<TE>   However, the director himself was not blacklisted and went on to
make a historical epic, "The Emperor and the Assassin" (1999), and a
contemporary drama, "Together" (2002), in China.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow director and Beijing Film Academy schoolmate Tian
Zhuangzhuang has not been so fortunate. After publicly criticizing
government policy and then making "The Blue Kite," he was blacklisted
in 1993, the year the film was completed, for an unspecified term.</TE>
<TE>   Prevented from directing, Tian has stayed busy helping others get
films produced. "Springtime in a Small Town," based on a classic 1948
film about a love triangle, is, in a sense, his public
rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, anyone making a feature in China is subject to
government regulation. There must be script approval before shooting
begins, and then final-cut approval if the film is to be shown in
China.</TE>

<KH>A NIGHT AT LACMA</KH>
<HD>The county art museum: A great place to hang</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Rubin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On any given Friday evening, hundreds of people gather at a popular
spot where they can listen free to live jazz, sip drinks, munch on
snacks from a celebrity chef and check out singles of all ages and
ethnicities. This is no trendy bar -- it's the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art.</LD>
<LD>   Since April 1992, LACMA has offered free live jazz on Friday
nights in the Times Mirror Central Court, a grand name for the space
between the Anderson and Hammer buildings. But there's more than
music in the air -- perhaps it's the wafting pheromones of an
audience that's largely young and single. Because what began a decade
ago as a tentative experiment to lure museum-goers in the off hours
-- and soon developed into one of the city's top live music programs
-- has lately evolved into a raging singles scene.</LD>
<LD>   Museum workers set up 150 or so chairs near the stage, while
another 100 or so seats are set up farther back, clustered around
small cafe tables. Serious music lovers come as early as 3 or 4 p.m.
to secure a seat near the front for the concerts, which run from 5:30
to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays from April through the end of December.</LD>
<TE>   Dorrance Stalvey, who has worked for LACMA for more than 30 years,
books the bands for these festivities, as well as all live music
programming at the museum. Pianist Frank Strazzeri was the first act
a decade ago, and Stalvey has had everyone from Kurt Elling and the
late Horace Tapscott to Brad Mehldau and Nels Cline on the small
stage.</TE>
<TE>   Joachim Splichal's Patina Catering runs the food and beverage
operation. During the summer months, visitors can order from a
barbecue stand; otherwise, the hungry can seek high-end nourishment
from Pentimento, more casual (and less expensive) fare at the
self-serve Plaza Cafe, or grab a cappuccino from a cart stocked with
Illy Caffe products.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the action revolves around the bar. While music lovers
gravitate toward the seats, singles who come for the scene --
sometimes 1,000 or more -- mill around at the back. "We sell a few
hundred drinks on a slow night," says one bartender who declined to
give his name. Favorites among the jazz crowd include sparkling wine
from Roederer Estate, apple martinis, cosmopolitans and Cognac.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Tahan, 31, has attended half-a-dozen Friday evening jazz
performances at LACMA over the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something fun to do," he says. "You can hang out here for a
while and think about what to do with the rest of the evening." He
doesn't even bother to check to see which band is playing. "I like
the place, the din, the people."</TE>
<TE>   Visiting LACMA for the first time, Frederick Vincent, 30, likes
what he sees. "It's gonna be a regular thing for me. The women you'd
meet here," he speculates, "are higher caliber, and they like quality
music.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys in my office will like it here," Vincent says, sipping a
Glenfiddich and looking around.</TE>
<TE>   For first-time visitor Justin Ware, 30, Fridays at LACMA offers a
serene setting to "sit and talk, and enjoy a glass of wine. So much
of L.A. is crowded and super hip. This is more mellow, relaxing," he
says, drinking a glass of merlot.</TE>
<TE>   His friend, Shana Furlow, 30, lives nearby and has attended
several times in the past. "I enjoy the whole experience," she says,
sipping chardonnay. "It's quintessential L.A. -- outdoor jazz on a
Friday night in the winter."</TE>

<LD>With its power lunches, black-tie fund-raisers and country club
political culture, Washington, D.C., wouldn't seem a dance music
mecca. The truth is, however, the capital has capital in the world of
DJ culture. It is hometown to Grammy-winning remixers Deep Dish,
trance pioneer BT, DJ Scott Henry and progressive house producers
Saeed &amp; Palash. Oh, and two dapper electronic music producers, Eric
Hilton, 36, and Rob Garza, 32, who record under the name Thievery
Corporation.</LD>
<LD>   In custom suits fetched from Soho, London, and knocking down
cocktails at Hilton's own Eighteenth Street Lounge, the duo could be
mistaken for transplants from the Sunset Strip, TriBeCa or the West
End, but the truth is, D.C. is a fitting base for these global beat
aficionados. The city draws overseas musical energy like a radio
tower in a thunderstorm, and, sonic thieves that they are, Hilton and
Garza tap every democratic volt. They are known to comb secondhand
record bins for the discarded vinyl collections of international
ambassadors gone home.</LD>
<LD>   As the pair set out this fall on a 10-city North American tour
(including a stop Friday at the Wiltern Theatre) to support their
third album, "The Richest Man in Babylon," they brought along this
sonic heritage and asked several musicians from the CD, including
five singers, two percussionists and a sitar player, to join them.</LD>
<TE>   Hilton was hosting warehouse parties with Deep Dish's Ali
"Dubfire" Shirazinia before he met Garza, then an aviation security
specialist. The guys bonded over Brazilian tunes and jazz. Soon their
Eighteenth Street Lounge Music label was in effect, giving birth to
globally flavored e-music such as Nicola Conte's "Bossa Per Due,"
later featured in a commercial for Acura.</TE>
<TE>   Early this year, the pair was tapped to compile the Verve label
jazz classics that influenced them most for "Sounds From the Verve
Hi-Fi," a play on Thievery's acclaimed debut CD, "Sounds From the
Thievery Hi-Fi." On "The Richest Man," released last month, Hilton
and Garza evolve into consuls of soul, dub and spaced-out hip-hop,
although some hard-core Thievery fans decry the album's thin
break-beats and live feel. "The bulk of criticism we get from early
fans is that we lost our true roots, because the first record was
very beat-oriented," Hilton says.</TE>
<TE>   "That influence is still there, it's just a lot more subtle,"
Garza adds. Indeed, "The Richest Man" is dance music for grown-ups, a
15-course meal featuring live tablas, violin, sitar, conga and
waifish vocals that are compressed into a work of digital elegance.
The title track takes us to bittersweet Caribbean squalor with
Kingston horns and vocals by Notch from Born Jamericans that could be
taken as political satire: "There is no guidance in your kingdom /
Your wicked walk in Babylon ..."</TE>
<TE>   The disc's packaging is as understated as the music. An enclosed
48-page booklet features melancholy Third World black-and-white
photographs from American Red Cross photojournalist Daniel Sima.</TE>
<TE>   There is no style without substance with Thievery Corporation. The
duo is down in the tradition of Motown artists who sported matching
custom suits. "It's a part of being professional," says Hilton.
"Style or clothing -- I don't think it's so diametrically opposed to
having humanity."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as the last line on the CD booklet demonstrates, it's not
antithetical to having a message: "Recorded at ESL Studios in
Washington, D.C. (the heart of Babylon)."</TE>

Society went on the block this week.</LD>
<LD>   The 189-year-old collection, which includes such rarities as the
original manuscript of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, commissioned by
the society, was bought by the British Library for about $1.5 million
after a last-minute donation of about $237,000 from the U.K. national
Heritage Lottery Fund.</LD>
<LD>   The collection includes other original scores and correspondence
from such composers as Tchaikovsky, Berlioz and Liszt.</LD>

<HD>The word from Detroit</HD>
<DH>Eminem isn't the only voice. Have you heard from Slum
Village?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott T. Sterling</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the not so distant past, the phrase "Detroit hip-hop" was an
oxymoron. Music fans were most likely to call it Detroit Rock City or
Motown, or the home of P-Funk and the birthplace of techno. But,
until Eminem exploded, the Motor City's hip-hop heart beat only in
underground circles.</LD>
<LD>   The epicenter of that scene was a nondescript storefront called
the Hip-Hop Shop. Detroit's finest MCs honed their skills at a weekly
open mike there, including a young Eminem -- and members of Slum
Village. The trio, which then consisted of rappers T-3 and Baatin and
innovative DJ-producer Jay Dee, was the act industry execs and
insiders felt was poised to break onto the national stage. Their odds
only increased when Jay Dee became a top producer for hip-hop elite
like De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest.</LD>
<LD>   Label snafus, however, left their debut album in limbo until 1999,
when "Fantastic, Vol. 2" was released to critical praise. But by
then, bootleg copies had been making the rounds for a year and Eminem
had become a star, defining the sound and the color of Detroit
hip-hop. According to Slum Village's T-3, little has changed since
those days at the Hip-Hop Shop.</LD>
<TE>   "The Detroit scene is not blowing up at all," he explains. "The
labels aren't checking for other Detroit acts. And if they were,
they'd be looking for white boys anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Slum Village has managed to rise above the marketing on its latest
album, "Trinity (Past, Present and Future)," which boasts its first
bona fide radio hit, "Tainted."</TE>
<TE>   "Our sound comes from a whole other spectrum," T-3 explains of
Slum Village's panoramic approach. "We're more aligned with neo-soul
acts like D'Angelo, Common and the Roots."</TE>
<TE>   The group even turned rampant bootlegging to its advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "That ended up helping us. We went out on the Lyricist Lounge
tour, with the Roots and with A Tribe Called Quest on their farewell
tour. We made a lot of fans that way," he recalls. "That all happened
from the buzz on the bootlegs, so it was a blessing in disguise."</TE>
<TE>   Slum Village took "Trinity" deep into new hip-hop turf, with nods
to such far-reaching sounds as Radiohead.</TE>
<TE>   "We go out and find new inspirations and bring them back to
hip-hop to keep things fresh," T-3 says.</TE>
<TE>   Also keeping things fresh is the addition of third MC Elzhi, who
brings a battle-ready edge to T-3's no-nonsense flow and Baatin's
oft-spiritual and more esoteric approach to rhyming.</TE>
<TE>   "With 'Trinity,' we combined the soulful sound of the old Slum
Village with our current style and what we see as our future sound,"
T-3 says. "So people get the full spectrum of what we're about."</TE>

<HD>Playing from punk's core</HD>

<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brody ARMSTRONG discovered punk rock when she was 13. It was a sound
well-established by then, born a few years before she was, but punk
could still feed and soothe the rage and confusion of a teenager in
Melbourne, Australia.</LD>
<LD>   What she heard then were core punk bands like Discharge GBH, the
Clash and the Damned. "It was exactly how I felt," says Armstrong,
now 23. "It was a language I could understand."</LD>
<LD>   As the tattooed singer-guitarist for the Distillers, Armstrong
leads a three-piece unit that reaches back to the core and clarity of
early punk, spewing anger with her gritty Courtney Love-like
delivery. The band's breakout single, "Seneca Falls," has recently
awakened audiences far beyond the punk underground, with the band on
the radio, on MTV and now on tour with No Doubt.</LD>
<TE>   On the Distillers' second album, "Sing Sing Death House," songs
rush together, militant and anthem-like. Her raspy snarl is as
convincing as any of her old punk heroes, singing lyrics that are a
tough blend of anger and humor since the days of her first band,
Sourpuss.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother did not want me to do it, so I dropped out of school
for it," Armstrong says now. "I never went back. I did know I could
do something with it."</TE>
<TE>   She came to Los Angeles in 1997 to be with her future husband,
singer Tim Armstrong of Rancid, after meeting him at an Australian
rock festival. Now signed to a major label, she's ready for a new
struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first made a video, kids were up in arms," Armstrong
says. "I don't think we're sellouts. We're not here to sacrifice what
we do for the music elite.</TE>
<TE>   "I want longevity. I'm not in this for the money. I want to be an
artist, I don't want to be a flash in the pan."</TE>

<HD>Ladytron lightens up in Los Angeles</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Reuben Wu and his British electro band Ladytron came to Los
Angeles to finish the album "Light and Magic," the quartet found
their moody '80s Manchester vibe transformed by California sun. "We
were driving with Joy Division in the stereo," says Wu. "But as soon
as you put it in the sunshine of L.A., it took a whole new meaning."</LD>
<LD>   The album track, "Fire," which originally reflected the bleak
industrial minimalism of Wu's hometown of Liverpool, was subsequently
given warmer layers of guitar and percussion. Ladytron made the album
in L.A. rather than in that other capital of electro-clash, Berlin,
hoping to get beyond nostalgia.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not '80s revivalists," asserts Wu. All four members of
Ladytron -- including songwriter Daniel Hunt -- play analogue
synthesizers, with Helena Marnie and Miro Aroyo delivering the
deadpan, dreamy android vocals that also connect Ladytron to the
synthetic '80s.</LD>
<TE>   "The main thing that makes us stand out from electro-clash is that
we're a band," says Wu. Electro-clash is more of a dance-floor scene.</TE>
<TE>   Wu is on a deejay tour, including a stop at Echo Is Electro. But
will Wu fall in line with their electro-clash vibe? Don't bet on it.</TE>

<HD>It's Person of the Year time at Time</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With five weeks to go before it must declare its Person of the Year,
Time magazine gathered some of its New York editors and writers for
lunch with invited guests Wednesday to debate potential names in
public. The consensus front-runners: President Bush, not
surprisingly, along with a "generic" alternative: "The Terrorist."</LD>
<LD>   Managing Editor Jim Kelly asked for reactions to a longshot name,
that of Coleen Rowley, the Minneapolis FBI agent who helped expose
failures in intelligence gathering pre-Sept. 11. "Not only do you get
the war on terror, but you get the whistle-blower phenomenon," Kelly
said. Then someone suggested that "99% of the readers will not know
who this is," and it was back to Bush vs. the Terrorist.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly said he and other Time editors had considered Osama bin
Laden a year ago, but "thought he had died" in the mountain caves of
Tora Bora, and the magazine went with New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. This year, though Bin Laden himself did not seem likely to
get the nod, the magazine would not steer away from spotlighting the
impact of terrorists around the world, Kelly said, even if that might
anger some readers. Any choice makes some people unhappy, he noted,
recalling, "We had some subscriptions canceled when we named Bush two
years ago."</LD>

<HD>Jackson regrets stunt with baby</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Singer Michael Jackson issued an apology for dangling his barefoot
baby son out of a fourth-floor hotel window in Germany on Tuesday,
shocking fans around the world at what appeared to be a reckless
stunt.</LD>
<LD>   "I offer no excuses for what happened. I made a terrible mistake.
I got caught up in the excitement of the moment. I would never
intentionally endanger the lives of my children," Jackson said in a
statement issued in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The statement confirmed that the baby, who Jackson held briefly
over a metal railing, its head covered in a towel, was the singer's
new son. It said Jackson showed the baby to fans outside his Berlin
hotel window "in response to some fans' request to see Michael's new
son."</LD>

<HD>Solving this one is murder</HD>
<DH>Unique mystery 'Hukkle' demands concentration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Time Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hungary Presents 2002, screening today through Sunday at the Music
Hall, includes Gyorgy Palfi's "Hukkle" (Friday at 5 p.m.), which
seems like an ethnographic survey of life in an ancient, sleepy
farming community with only a blender or a microwave to indicate that
the time is the present. There are close-ups of old machinery set in
motion, of a ladybug crawling up a young woman's chest, even
time-lapse shots of flowers coming into bloom. The result is an
observation of people and animals going about the rituals of everyday
bucolic life in seemingly eternal harmony with nature.</LD>
<LD>   "Hukkle," however, shows its distinctiveness and humor right at
the start, keying its rhythmic pace to the hiccuping of an elderly
man sitting on a bench all day. After roughly 30 minutes, this droll
77-minute film begins to take on a darker tone, with a kitten fatally
poisoned. "Hukkle," however, is so elliptical it demands intense
concentration or a second viewing -- or both -- to solve what becomes
a unique murder mystery. (310) 446-1706.</LD>
<TE>   The UCLA Film and Television Archive's "New Chinese Cinema" opens
at 7:30 p.m. Saturday in Melnitz Hall's James Bridges Theater with
"Springtime in a Small Town," Tian Zhuangzhuang's exquisite remake of
Fei Mui's 1948 original, one of the greatest films of the remarkably
diverse pre-revolutionary Chinese cinema. (See details, Page 10)
"Springtime" marks the comeback of Zhuangzhuang a decade after his
"Blue Kite" brought him both international acclaim and the wrath of
the government for his unsparing depiction of the fate of one family
from the '50s to the Cultural Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   It is 1946, and after years in constant flight during the war, Dai
Liyan (Wu Jun) has at last returned home to a small town, where his
ancestral mansion stands partly damaged in a neighborhood of
bombed-out ruins. He apparently is still wealthy, but Liyan, who
believes he has tuberculosis, wearily observes, "My health is beyond
repair, like this house."</TE>
<TE>   Everything changes, however, when his lifelong friend Zhang Zichen
( Xin Baiqing), a dashing, vigorous doctor, arrives from Shanghai for
an extended visit. Zhang's examination shows Liyan free of TB, and
this gentle man's health and spirits immediately begin to improve.
There is a hitch: Zhang and Liyan's beautiful wife, Yuwen (Hu
Jingfan), are startled by the sight of one another, for 10 years
earlier they had fallen in love, but it hadn't worked out for them to
marry. Yuwen has grown increasingly estranged from Liyan in their
arranged marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "Springtime in a Small Town" reveals with subtlety and compassion
the character of aristocrats steeped in a traditional sense of honor
and duty. Zhuangzhuang generates muted tension and emotion within
this triangle and inspires his three stars, all newcomers, to give
supple portrayals. The graceful "Springtime in a Small Town" marks
the welcome return of a world-class filmmaker. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JOHN O'Keefe calls his play that's set in Nazi-era Germany "Times
Like These," not "Times Like Those." His reasoning might ruffle some
feathers.</LD>
<LD>   "If you are moved by political elements in this play that resonate
with what's happening now, I'm open to that comparison," says the
62-year-old San Francisco-based writer and director.</LD>
<LD>   "Times Like These," in an acclaimed staging by Padua Playwrights
Productions at 2100 Square Feet, is loosely based on a true story of
a famous acting couple in prewar Germany who were persecuted and
threatened with deportation to a camp because the wife was Jewish.</LD>
<TE>   Still, O'Keefe's play "is not a political diatribe; it's not
something that might be done by the San Francisco Mime Troupe," which
is known for its pointedly political work. "It's a love story."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, even though the trilogy that includes "Times
Like These" is set in the era surrounding World War II, it was
inspired by the 2000 election of George W. Bush. "It was so shocking
that the process just stopped, that everything was chaos, that we
could begin to observe what forces were at work."</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks occurred while O'Keefe was working on the
play. The day "was such a trauma," he says, and he initially thought:
"By God, let's get them A-rabs." But then he began to see potential
parallels between current events and events in the "Times Like These"
era. He felt it was conceivable that martial law could be declared to
"protect" the citizenry. The phrase "homeland security" reminded him
of terms used in fascist societies.</TE>
<TE>   His speculations "sound like old lefty politics," he admits, but
his previous writings were not notably political; they include his
monologue "Shimmer," about his formative years in an Iowa youth
detention facility.</TE>
<TE>   He wants theatergoers who prefer to appreciate the play without
thinking about current politics to be able to do so. "I'm not saying
these times are exactly like those. I'm saying let's frame the play
in this context and see what people think."</TE>
<TE>   The play premiered at the Cinnabar Theater in Petaluma earlier
this year under the title "Crystal Night" -- referring to the
infamous Nazi attack on German Jews known as Kristallnacht. But
O'Keefe changed the title because "people were looking at it totally
as a Holocaust play, which they don't want to see again and again."</TE>
<TE>   While here, he took advantage of L.A.'s acting pool to stage a
reading of the first play in the trilogy, "Glamour," about a wartime
episode in the life of poet Robert Graves.</TE>
<TE>   The final entry in the trilogy is "The Nazi and the Texan." But
don't jump to conclusions -- the title refers to a spy who worked for
both Germany and America and liked all things Western, not to anyone
currently in power.</TE>

<HD>Ray blends new, recent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For her part in this season's Piano Spheres series, Tuesday at Zipper
Hall, Vicki Ray offered what we've come to expect of her -- new music
played with an ideal mix of acuity and passion. On a program of fair
historical sweep, Ray presented three premieres and four 20th century
pieces rescued from obscurity.</LD>
<LD>   The best came first. Piggybacking pieces by Mel Powell and Morton
Feldman, Ray illustrated two views of the strong-but-delicate
aesthetic. Two characteristically concise post-serial Powell pieces
-- the Etude of 1955 and Prelude of 1988 -- reminded us of his moving
distillation process, making small gestures and forms count.
Feldman's special brand of delicacy sounded, via Ray's surreal
balancing act, enigmatic and dancing.</LD>
<LD>   Opening the concert's second half, Ray had the wise idea of
following an aviary theme: George Antheil's "The Golden Bird (after
Brancusi)" (1921) and bird man Messiaen's "Le Loriot" (The Golden
Oriole), with a mercurial blend of stately material and flitting
interjections of bird song.</LD>
<TE>   Ray's premieres intrigued, even if they didn't always soar. South
African-born, Los Angeles-based Shaun Naidoo's "no man's land" is a
longish, nattering piece, moving from stern low range dissonance to
vaguely tango-like pulses along the way, including subtle echoes of
another South African musician, jazz pianist Abdullah Ibrahim. Jay
Cloidt's "Span" is serious playfulness, a reconstruction of elements
and quotations from the piano traditions in blues (a la Otis Span)
and early rock 'n' roll. Charming enough, it doesn't quite transcend
the tired post-Modernist pastiche syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Chasalow's "Due (Cinta)mani" quixotically blended Ray's
real-time, vigorously physical pianism with virtual electronic
manipulations. It made for a happy electro-acoustic marriage.</TE>

<LD>Ask any ballet dancer: There's a ritual to putting away a pair of
pointe shoes. First, push the soft satin of the heel forward toward
the hard, boxy toe. Fold the sides of the shoe over the flattened
heel. Then, take the two long ribbons -- used to secure the shoe at
the ankle -- and wrap them around and around the folded satin.</LD>
<LD>   Then shove the tidy, pale pink package into the chaos of stuff you
always tote around in your dance bag.</LD>
<LD>   In her 20 years as a ballet student and as a former Pasadena
Ballet dancer, Marissa Labog, 26, has performed the drill a thousand
times. But tonight, the battered pink shoes in her hands aren't for
"Swan Lake." Tonight, at the monthly Carnival Choreographers Ball at
the Key Club on Sunset Strip, she'll be breakin' -- in pointe shoes.</LD>
<TE>   You can call it break dancing, but dancers will laugh at you. It's
just breaking -- a bone-jarring subset of a larger world called
hip-hop, or freestyle, dance. Breaking -- aptly named, considering
the risk to cranium, neck and wrist -- only applies to the most
gymnastic, gravity-defying moves. Hands serve the traditional purpose
of feet. Except for Labog's dance experiment, no pointe shoes, just
Adidas and Pumas, and maybe taped wrists, kneepads or helmets. A
thick knit cap is not a fashion statement but a necessity if you plan
to dance on your head.</TE>
<TE>   Hip-hop is now standard fare in music videos, pop music tours and
youth-oriented TV commercials for candy-colored cell phones and
low-as-you-can-go-rise jeans. It's pop culture not subculture. It's
also big business: As they do for star athletes, clothing and
athletic shoe manufacturers provide free stuff or even pay
sponsorship fees to high-profile dancers.</TE>
<TE>   Wade Robson, 20, was choreographing tours, videos and commercials
for Britney Spears, 'N Sync, Janet Jackson and other artists while
still in his teens. He looks at the dance today and says the moves
just keep getting more, well, more. "There are some people out there
doing insane stuff," he says. "It's like X-sports, or extreme sports
-- it's X-dance.</TE>
<TE>   "In the '60s, '70s and '80s there were certain dances that
everybody knew; that rarely happens now," Robson adds. "There are so
many types of dance now, each little clique has a little language of
its own; it's like all these little tribes."</TE>
<TE>   Even though it's gone commercial, there are still a few places in
Los Angeles where you can see what Bill Prudich, co-owner and
director of Edge Performing Arts Center, calls "it" -- live hip-hop
dance and breaking in its pure form. Freestyle that's really free
style, without the inhibiting requirements of selling a product.</TE>
<TE>   One of those places is the Key Club's monthly Carnival, a showcase
usually presented on the last Wednesday of the month. It offers a
creative alternative for choreographers and dancers who make their
living in commercials, videos or rock tours, or those with
less-visible gigs at private parties, special events or bar mitzvahs.</TE>
<TE>   The dance movements called "locking" and "popping" -- precursors
to breaking, or "B-boying" -- were born in the 1970s, on the streets
of L.A. and Fresno. This bit of dance history comes courtesy of
SugaPop, 34, longtime member of one of the seminal dance groups, the
Electric Boogaloos. In recent decades, hip-hop has moved into the
dance studio. Many local dance schools, including Hollywood's Edge
and North Hollywood's Millennium Dance Complex, teach hip-hop
alongside ballet, modern and jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Although dancers interested in Broadway musicals might best hop a
plane for New York City, "this is the commercial capital of the
world," says Carnival executive director Carey Ysais. "Every year
there's another 500 or 600 dancers coming here, trying to make it.
And there's really only 100, 150 who are working at any given time --
maybe. There are always auditions, but choreographers are always
working with the same people."</TE>
<TE>   Those people, including Labog, are hungry for a showcase like
Carnival. Seated on the wood floor before the show, with legs splayed
wide in a position of comfortable relaxation for a dancer, pain for
an ordinary person, ballerina-breaker Labog is waiting for her chance
to take the stage to run through her number, "One Step Ahead," in
which she will break the rules of breakin' by executing hip-hop moves
en pointe.</TE>
<TE>   In the hip-hop world, Labog is known as "Mighty," even though,
size wise, she could be the "Tiny Dancer" immortalized in the old
Elton John song. She radiates enough energy to justify her hip-hop
name.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to really show that you can do everything, put two styles
together," she says, determination shining in her dark eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Carnival doesn't officially begin until 11 p.m., but the line
begins snaking down the block as early as 8. There are other Los
Angeles venues where dancers gather, but most are sporadic and few
are as popular.</TE>
<TE>   Choreographers and performers do Carnival for free. For once, it's
not about the money, says Ysais, who produces the 3-year-old event
for DMK World with partners Kimo Keoke and Paulette Azizian. It's
about the love.</TE>
<TE>   Well, half about the love -- and half about the audition. While
participants celebrate the chance to try something different -- maybe
outrageous -- onstage, they remain aware that casting agents, or
maybe a pop star looking for someone to bust a move in the next world
tour, may be prowling out there in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   "Soul Train" dancers Luciana Bell (professional name: Shine) and
Sha'llah Brewton, both performing in tonight's Carnival with the
Arizona dance troupe Footklan, admit they come here for the exposure.
For these two aspiring dancer-model-actors, being seen is more
important than chatting with the press. "I'm just trying to dance,"
Bell scolds gently, escaping an attempted interview to reenter the
throbbing crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Though open to the public, Carnival remains mostly a by-dancers,
for-dancers kind of event, publicized by word-of-mouth. "The
underground level is so immense, we regularly have talent here from
Japan, Las Vegas, Europe, everywhere -- it's large," says producer
Keoke.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have to be as safe as commercial producers or
directors expect them to be. Sometimes, that lends itself to being
edgy or risque or provocative. That's a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   "We see circus people, people topless, people working with fire or
water or pushing the boundaries physically, emotionally,
theatrically," Keoke adds. "Along with hip-hop, they may toss in some
stunts, do some harness work or fly through the air."</TE>
<TE>   Labog is not the only Carnival dancer who wants to break down
barriers between movement styles tonight. Look up, way up; there's
Trey Knight, a former professional roller skater who dances on
stilts; there's acrobat Brandon Sanford, who performs by twisting his
body around a billowing piece of white fabric that stretches from
ceiling to floor.</TE>
<TE>   And Labog has found a soul mate in Jules Urich, 26, who recently
moved here from Philadelphia, where she performed with the hip-hop
company Rennie Harris Puremovement. "I'm a breaker," Urich says
proudly. On this night, she plans to fuse breaking with modern dance
in "Silent Storm," performed to the sound of her own voice reading
text she has written.</TE>
<TE>   In rehearsal, Urich assumes humanly impossible poses to a
persistent throb of words and tribal drumbeats. "I remember having
dreams where I was going down a roller coaster hill, where I would be
walking and every step would be like walking through quicksand, my
tongue would swell, I couldn't form the words to call for help," says
Urich's taped voice. "The next thing I knew, I was popping Prozac
like Sweetarts."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles dance scene is a little different from what
happens back East, confides Urich. "A lot of it is based on looks
more than skill," she says, ignoring the surrounding host of dancers
in Spandex, sportswear or leather.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps L.A. could be a little grimier. Urich cites this term as
one that has recently entered the ever-changing lexicon of hip-hop
slang. It means good, like, grimy, really nasty. Urich is on a
mission to transcend L.A. glitz. "I want to change where hip-hop is
going," she says. "It's really very commercial, and I'd like to take
it into a new form."</TE>
<TE>   Labog and Urich, Mighty and Jules, are B-girls, breaker girls, in
a testosterone world peopled mostly with B-boys. The ratio is slowly
changing -- but Labog recalls teaching a breaking class in which one
B-boy, just out of prison, approached her to ask if she had a
boyfriend. When she said yes, he responded in surprise: "Oh, your boy
lets you come out and break?"</TE>
<TE>   Labog doesn't meet guys like that at the Key Club. But sometimes
they turn up on Monday nights at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in
Hollywood, where she teaches breaking to disenfranchised youths
through the Hope in Hollywood Organization. Most breakers you run
into know about Mondays at St. Stephen's -- when rap music, not the
church choir, blares into the street from the open door. Ricardo
"Stuntman" Romo, 25, co-director of the dance program with Labog, was
in and out of trouble, in and out of prison, before he began to focus
on dance.</TE>
<TE>   Jacob "Kujo" Lyons, 26, has taught at Edge and is also a regular
here. "We have an informal community; we all help each other," he
observes during a break from teaching a young woman in a red hat to
spin on her shoulders on the floor, legs splayed in a V that rotates
in the air. This is called, aptly, "floor work"; dancing while
standing up is "top-rock."</TE>
<TE>   "We sort of look alike, with our colorful dress and our attitude;
there are all these little signs that the police tend to watch for,"
Lyons offers with a crooked smile. "I've been kicked out of every
park in Burbank."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ko, 20, a Pierce College business student from Woodland
Hills, hardly fits the "troubled youth" stereotype, but he comes here
all the time. "It's just a hobby; it makes me focus on myself," he
says. "It's a true party thing. It's clean party -- no drugs. Just
music and water."</TE>
<TE>   Don't ask Steven DeLeon, 23-year-old manager of Workmens hip-hop
clothing store on Melrose, if he can get you a copy of the "Freestyle
Session 7" double video. Four people have already called today and
made it only as far as the waiting list. Also hot are "Battle of the
Year 2000" and "Battle of the Year 2001," tapes of a major annual
competition held in various cities around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Workmens is arguably L.A.'s primary clearinghouse for videos of
the numerous hip-hop battles, or competitions, that happen all over
the world.</TE>
<TE>   Most people don't know the videos exist, but dancers wait eagerly
for the latest release to use as choreographic inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   Workmens is sold out of the brand-new "Freestyle Session 7" --
featuring more than 29 dance "crews," including Fiends 4 Rhythm,
Battle Monkeys and Grimeez -- but you can get either of the two
videos playing concurrently on the 10 video screens in the store:
"City vs. City: Chicago's 2nd Annual B-Boy Competition" and "Style
Elements B-Boy Remind." Or any of dozens of others.</TE>
<TE>   Although Carnival offers an alternative to more commercial dance
fare, some call the Key Club event mainstream compared to what turns
up on these videos, circulated through stores catering to the hip-hop
community, and available through such hip-hop Web sites as
freestylesession.com and bboying.com.</TE>
<TE>   And there is even a sublevel below this underground, says Brendan
Filuk, a dancer and choreographer's agent with the 2-year-old BLOC
agency.</TE>
<TE>   At some smaller stores, he says, dancers exchange videos of
battles that take place in alleyways and basements, along the lines
of home movies. He adds that many young dancers are eager to study
the work of the old masters of the '70s and '80s.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen those tapes," Filuk says. "That is a real subculture
within the culture. A lot of dancers watch those tapes religiously.
It's like a trumpeter watching tapes of Dizzy Gillespie. They'll sit
and watch those tapes all night. To be honest, those dancers tend not
to be your mainstream, working dancers. They just love dancing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hip-hop: and how</TE>
<TE>   The hip-hop dance community spreads the word largely by informal
methods such as word-of-mouth, fliers, postcards and posted notices
(check the bulletin boards at dance schools, hip-hop clothing stores,
or youth groups with dance programs). Here are a few places to get
started:</TE>
<TE>   Carnival Choreographer's Ball</TE>
<TE>   Where: Key Club, 9039 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood,</TE>
<TE>   (310) 274-5800 or dmkworld.com.</TE>
<TE>   When: Usually the last Wednesday of the month, performance</TE>
<TE>   11 p.m.-2 a.m.; due to holidays</TE>
<TE>   the next Carnivals are Dec. 4</TE>

<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim and Liza Goodell have been busy lately. The owners of Aubergine
in Newport Beach and Troquet in Costa Mesa have branched out with
Whist in Santa Monica and two new Orange County restaurants, Red
Pearl Kitchen and Lodge. Each of the restaurants has a distinct
personality; better than cloning the same concept over and over.</LD>
<LD>   The latest, a playful take on the hunting or fishing lodge, is the
perfect concept for its setting. Lodge is in an eccentric mall called
the Camp, a stone's throw from Memphis restaurant and the funky Lab
(which bills itself as the "anti-mall"); in other words, the stomping
grounds of O.C.'s youthful bohemians.</LD>
<LD>   It's out there, all right. The Camp's buildings appear to be
constructed of corrugated galvanized aluminum and glass -- very
low-profile. There's an outdoor and mountaineering store, a surfing
and snowboarding shop and a yoga school.</LD>
<TE>   Following the arrows pointing toward the Lodge, we pass plantings
of native grasses and artfully placed rocks. Hidden speakers project
the sound of waves washing on shore, so it's startling to see a
couple of scuba divers in full gear emerge from a swimming pool at
night. It turns out the Camp includes a scuba center, too. And around
a bend, we find a campfire burning all by itself, with no "campers"
around.</TE>
<TE>   At Lodge, you're greeted by a roaring fire (probably fake) in a
'60s-style stone fireplace. The bar stools are molded fiberglass in
bright colors. A few token deer heads and a pouting boar's head hang
on the wall. And the view -- well, it's the lights of the Lab
"anti-mall" across the street.</TE>
<TE>   The place is only half full, yet the noise level is enough to make
ordering a challenge. It looks like girls' night out at one table --
the one having the most fun -- and a birthday party at another.</TE>
<TE>   The food is right in keeping with the design: American comfort
food from the Ozzie and Harriet era. That means iceberg lettuce in
blue cheese dressing, pork and beans, meatloaf, pot roast and the
like, along with macaroni and cheese and, of course, a burger and a
BLT.</TE>
<TE>   The steamed mussels and clams are nice. So are the plump little
peeky toe crab cakes and the meaty baby back ribs. Artichoke stuffed
with garlic, parsley, breadcrumbs and Parmesan is a good appetizer to
share, the bracelet-like onion rings, too. The main courses could use
some tweaking, though. The chicken pot pie is as floury as wallpaper
paste, and some of the meat dishes aren't well executed.</TE>
<TE>   The Lodge is very new, and it's hard to tell how it will shake
out. Still, I'm beginning to wonder whether the Goodells have the
infrastructure to keep the quality up at every one of their
restaurants. Time will tell.</TE>

only time I can catch up with friends and relax. I live on the
Westside, and there's a place there that I highly recommend. It's
west of the 405 -- you can really get away from everything. It's
called the Self-Realization Center on Sunset at Pacific Coast
Highway. There's a lakeside shrine and waterfall in this peaceful
oasis. It's not a long walk, maybe a quarter-mile loop around the
little temple and lake.</LD>
<TE>   On the nature tip, I love Huntington Gardens; they're an untapped
resource. And there's no place better for a romantic stroll through
those lovely Zen, Shakespeare, bonsai and the grand gardens. I like
to pretend it's my yard.</TE>
<TE>   On the move</TE>
<TE>   I like to take a yoga class on weekends. I go to Goda Yoga on
Washington in Culver City. Their classes give you a challenge but are
still easy enough for beginners. And I also like to hike in Runyon
Canyon and on different trails all over the Santa Monica Mountains. I
download audio books then I put them on my hand-held computer and
hike and listen. I just finished "The Prince of Ocean Park."</TE>
<TE>   Just browsing</TE>
<TE>   I'm really into photography. I love my digital camera and I take
it everywhere. Sometimes I go to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery and
take pictures of headstones of all of the stars of old Hollywood.
Some of the monuments are so beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a self-professed computer geek. I love electronics stores -- I
love technology. .</TE>
<TE>   When I'm not browsing some electronics store, I browse the
clothing shops shopping for vintage clothing or designer wear -- that
strip of Abbot Kinney near Sepulveda Boulevard in Venice. There's
Wabi-Sabi, a sushi bar near Venice Boulevard, that I like to stop in
when I'm in the neighborhood looking for clothes, then there's a
great little strip of furniture stores, midrange clothing stores with
very cute, trendy stuff, a deli, a coffee shop.</TE>
<TE>   It has all the things that I love about Paris right there -- the
cafes, places to sit and just watch people go by.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the Santa Monica Civic Center will have a trade show and
sell vintage clothes and textiles, and I love vintage clothes. Of
course, sometimes they'll have a cat fair and, though I have a sturdy
little mutt, I love to go look at the exotic breeds. Sometimes I'll
head to Artesia to check out all of the different fabrics in Little
India.</TE>
<TE>   A night out</TE>
<TE>   Nights I'll go to the Temple Bar on Wilshire in Santa Monica where
they'll play this kind of funky, world music kind of groove. The Jazz
Bakery over in Culver City is nice when I want to check out a little
jazz.</TE>
<TE>   For treats it's direct to Mani's Bakery for an absolutely great
assortment of delicious pastries. They've got a heart-shaped
chocolate truffle cookie that I'll have with a soy latte. Delicious!</TE>
<TE>   Dream weekend</TE>
<TE>   The ultimate, my dream weekend, would be a spa getaway to the
Golden Door spa or flying away to Paris for shopping or to Jamaica or
Hawaii. Of course, those destinations would be kind of a long haul,
which would make it kind of decadent. But l'd like that.</TE>
<TE>   I'd take scuba lessons. You know, a proper class, because the
ocean scares the heck out of me. I'd have to have those big water
wings, that's the only way.</TE>

<LD>The Nine O'Clock Players are getting better and better. The
all-female children's theater of the Assistance League of Southern
California, the company has notably polished up its efforts in recent
years, moving away from a less than compelling amateur history. It's
closer to prime time than ever with its latest charmer, "Sleepy
Hollow," based on the Washington Irving tale.</LD>
<LD>   A technical standout, the full-fledged song-and-dance show,
directed and choreographed with sure hand by Todd Nielsen, features a
fine job by the cast, especially in such essential male roles as
Nikki D'Amico-Vogel's preening Ichabod in cutaway coat and knee
britches, and Jodi Gilbert's brawny and bad Bram.</LD>
<LD>   The pair can't mask their femininity, but they succeed admirably
in submerging it, and the quality of their anchoring performances is
matched by Cecile Callan as Katrina, the object of Ichabod and Bram's
affections.</LD>
<TE>   The musical was written and composed with wit and melodic verve by
Vera Morris and Bill Francoeur. Musical director Nick Degregorio
gives the rousing songs a nifty blend of live and synthesized music.
Douglas Ridgeway's picturesque village set, lighting designer Jim
Moody's warm autumn tones and spooky night shadows, and Carol
Onofrio's Dutch-flavored period costumes provide their own three-way
harmony.</TE>

<HD>Theater outside the box</HD>
<DH>Color-filled puppet production gives those in the audience
a hands-on experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynne Heffley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The audience has arrived, but there's a crisis: The puppet stars of
"The Crayon Court" children's show at the Miles Memorial Playhouse
have been so busy rehearsing for the show that they haven't had time
to make the sets, explains their resident artist, Monsieur Beaux
Arts.</LD>
<LD>   So, he has a favor to ask: Would all the kids and grown-ups lend a
hand so that the show can go on?</LD>
<LD>   Soon, audience members young and old are dipping into buckets of
crayons and drawing trees, suns, flowers and anything else they fancy
onto long, white flats on the floor in front of the stage.</LD>
<TE>   The music cues up, Monsieur Beaux Arts -- a.k.a. the show's
creator, Thom Fountain, lead puppeteer for "Sabrina, the Teenage
Witch" -- greets late arrivals, and Miss Red, Miss Blue and other
larger-than-life crayon characters make their entrances in a
sweet-spirited, pop-style puppet celebration of color, art and music
with the audience-drawn scenery on display.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids are so used to sitting in front of the TV," Fountain said.
"I want them to feel a part of the production, that they have
contributed artistically to what they are watching, and that they
have the creativity in them as well."</TE>
<TE>   During the show, the big, soft-body puppets, from Indigo the
Jester and King Royal Purple to a rainbow-robed Professor Spectrum,
are deftly manipulated by black-clad professional puppeteers.</TE>
<TE>   They take the audience through a Bob Fosse-style lesson in
"Colornometry" that features hands in satiny gloves of all colors.</TE>
<TE>   In a crowd-pleaser of a blacklight number, fish cavort in an
undersea vignette; a "Dinosaur Stomp" interlude, led by dancing
dinosaur skeletons, keeps children actively involved, allowing them
to stand up, stretch and stomp their feet along with the music.</TE>
<TE>   After the show, the lights come up and Fountain and his ensemble
reveal a few trade secrets to show what's behind the puppet magic,
from the dancing Tyrannosaurus rex's bony components that are worked
with separate strings to how a piece of ripply fabric can become a
puppet too, creating the illusion of calm and stormy seas.</TE>
<TE>   Fountain finishes up his celebration of creativity by showing how
crossed hands can become wings, and the theater is soon filled with
fluttering butterflies.</TE>
<TE>   The sprightly show, a labor of love for Fountain, whose feature
film credits include both "Men in Black" movies, was financed with
his own money.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you could say Salem funded the show," he said, referring
to Sabrina's clever black cat.</TE>
<TE>   Fountain is working with the head of "Sabrina's" production
company, Hartbreak Films' Paula Hart, to develop the show as a TV
series.</TE>
<TE>   He is also planning to bring the live show and others now "on the
drawing board" to other local venues next year.</TE>
<TE>   A strong admirer of L.A.'s still operating, historic Bob Baker
Marionette Theatre, where he first rehearsed "Crayon Court," Fountain
hopes to spark enthusiasm among audiences of all ages for puppet
theater in general.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up going to puppet theater in Atlanta," Fountain said. "I
remember sitting in the theater when I was 8 years old and all of a
sudden my life changed because it was a place of magic. "I want to
give audiences that sense of magic."</TE>
<TE>   He also hopes to provide added opportunities for live stage
experience to puppeteers like Los Angeles Guild of Puppetry President
Christine Papalexis, who is among several guild members he hired for
his show.</TE>
<TE>   A film puppeteer with a raft of credits, Papalexis found her
passion for puppetry when she went to work at the Bob Baker theater
"20 years ago after college 'cause I didn't know what to do next with
my life."</TE>

great and long overdue. Producer Margot Hamilton says the alternative

just call it Mockabilly? Or better yet, Wannabilly?</LD>

<LD>S. Irene Virbila seems to have no idea what authentic Mexican cuisine
is like ("Confusion in the Kitchen," Oct. 31). We knew that we were
going to educate people on this matter. That is why we opened the
Spanish Kitchen. However, for a food critic to insinuate that soft
tacos, guacamole and green enchiladas are the only authentic things
on the menu is embarrassing. Soft tacos, like most tacos, are a
relatively new item to Mexican cuisine and meant to be eaten as a
roadside snack much like a hot dog. It has no place on a dinner menu.
And, yes, guacamole was a staple in Mayan cooking; however, so were
duck, goat, lamb, beef and all types of seafood including lobster!
She claims that white chocolate, duck, lobster and lamb are all
"elevated" ingredients. Surely Irene has never been to Mexico. If she
had she would know these to be daily ingredients in Mexican cuisine.</LD>
<TE>   She states, "It's not going to satisfy either the kids looking for
their fish taco fix or foodies in search for authentic regional
dishes." First, fish tacos were created nearly 30 years ago in Baja,
Calif., and are not "authentic." Second, all we have are regional
dishes. I have done a tremendous amount of research into this
project, in addition to the fact that my chef has been doing this for
30 years. I have been a reader of the food and entertainment section
in the L.A. Times for many years and never have I been so thoroughly
disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   It is sad to see the very thing we are trying to do -- introduce
Angelenos to real Mexican cuisine -- has been ambushed by someone who
should really know the difference.</TE>

<LD>   This pancake literally melts in your mouth. For Sunday brunch,
Saddle Peak Lodge's garde-manger chef Mathew Gries soaks vanilla
beans with their husks in the milk overnight and uses this milk in
the batter. He whips his egg whites into a stiff meringue and mixes a
scoop of batter with every two scoops of meringue, making light,
pillowy pancakes. Five of them are arranged in a circle and served
with warm blackberry compote and whipped creme fraiche. (Souffle
pancakes, $14.)</LD>

<HD>Going against the flow</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Maria Elena Fernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Welcome to my attractive roster of social possibilities. I've got a
gorgeous Brazilian restaurateur claiming he wants to take me out for
mojitos; a hard-working Cuban Mexican community activist saying he
wants to buy me lunch or dinner; and a cutie pie Jewish actor-waiter
who is just dying to "get together."</LD>
<LD>   The problem is none of these men is getting past the talking
stage. And it's not for a lack of patience on my end. The one who
hails from Rio de Janeiro has wanted to go on a second date with me
since September -- as in September 2001. But the poor soul seems to
suffer from selective amnesia; he can never remember to call or show
up. The do-gooder who wears his heart on his sleeve is not so good at
keeping track of time. Weeks and months elapse between phone calls,
but it's the thought that counts, right? And the third potential
companion, well, his problem is more difficult to discern. He never
got past the first call, and yet every time we run into each other,
he's so enthusiastic. Could he be rehearsing for a part?</LD>
<TE>   If I were living anywhere but here, I'd be very worried. I'd
wonder if there's something off about the way I treat the opposite
sex, or if my selection of men is poor. But this is Los Angeles,
where flakiness reigns and non-commitment runs free. "Can't we just
go with the flow?" the 33-year-old Brazilian once asked, after I lit
into him for standing me up twice. "Were you expecting a
relationship?" he continued to bury himself. "A commitment?"</TE>
<TE>   Wrong c-word, buddy! How about some not-so-common courtesy? It had
been months since I'd given this frustrating nonsense any thought.
Until my friend, Kim, called, serving up a familiar wallop. A
neighbor who had left a nice note on her car, expressing interest in
taking her out, had left the following message on her answering
machine when she accepted his offer: "I'd like to go out, but let's
go with the flow, maybe do something spontaneous.... I'll be kinda
busy for the next month, but it would be fun, so maybe I'll give you
a call again soon."</TE>
<TE>   Por Dios! Yes, California is laid-back and we are all busy career
people, but give me a break. I've spoken to enough male friends to
know this dilemma is not gender-specific. Women too suffer from this
disease that keeps them from wanting to be pinned down for a simple
cup of coffee -- always saving themselves for more interesting or
lucrative invitations.</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it: Dating is absurdly challenging all over this
country. Untraditional gender roles are a constant source of
insecurity and conflict. But after dating in four major cities over
the last nine years, I find Los Angeles the worst place on earth to
connect at any level. Forget romance. Even friendships are difficult
to establish. The mere thought of intimacy makes sharing mojitos, a
meal or even a moment more daunting than selling a screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we drive our fast cars to destinations where we are
noticed but never acknowledged. Daily, we go with the flow. In a
society built on illusion, we can easily fool ourselves into thinking
that this lifestyle is very Zen. But blindly following currents as we
insist on going with the flow might get us caught in riptides where
we find ourselves in trouble and alone.</TE>

<HD>Artist's vision lives</HD>
<DH>Dame Darcy turns a new page with her stylized graphic
novel, 'Frightful Fairytales.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Hundley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dame Darcy looks remarkably like one of her comic book heroines:
pixie-eared and lithe, with pale gold locks and the kind of alabaster
skin found on High Victorian ladies and little-girl ghosts. Making
tea in her Echo Park home, dressed in pink flounces and ruffled
skirts, she moves through the roar of the modern day like an
enchanted Alice just returned from Wonderland.</LD>
<LD>   Drawing since the age of 2, the artist, musician and animator grew
up in rural Idaho, in a creative household that encouraged playing
fanciful flights of the imagination. With her newest release,
"Frightful Fairytales" (Ten Speed Press), Darcy has chosen to abandon
traditional sequential structure in favor of the stylized graphic
novel, thus extending her unique aesthetic outside the limitations of
the comic book frame. The result is a sometimes gruesome, sometimes
winsome collection of short stories, embellished with Darcy's
elegantly spidery illustrations.</LD>
<LD>   "My father was an artist and he taught me early on about line and
color and perspective," says Darcy, 31. "I feel in some ways that my
life was sort of predestined for me. Which is a good thing. A lot of
people don't know what they want to do because they're good at many
things. I, however, am incredibly bad at pretty much anything except
for the arts."</LD>
<TE>   Darcy studied film at the San Francisco Art Institute and at 18
began to self-publish comic books. "I'm really an advocate for
self-publishing," she says. "You have a vision ... and you work as
best you can to make that idea into a reality."</TE>
<TE>   This theory has worked well for Darcy, whose hand-copied zines
eventually gained a cult following and a contract with Fantagraphics,
which publishes her popular comic book "Meatcake."</TE>
<TE>   With "Meatcake" and her subsequent animations and illustrations,
Darcy has created a childlike, otherworldly realm, a land that hovers
in the twilight space between the whimsical and the macabre. Ghosts
and goblins, foul-tempered stepmothers, lovesick mermaids and charmed
forests are all rendered in Darcy's distinctive hand, loose and
flowing lines reminiscent of the work of Edward Gorey. "I love
Surrealism and Dadaism and German Expressionism and the
Pre-Raphaelite painters," says Darcy. "I love turn-of-the-century
illustrators like John Tenniel, and W.W. Denslow, who did the 'Wizard
of Oz.' Those are the styles I was obsessed with as a child, and I've
brought all those obsessions into my work."</TE>
<TE>   "Frightful Fairytales" contains all the prerequisites set by the
Brothers Grimm: bewitched ships, magic jewels, mischievous elves and
wicked queens. Like the Grimms', Darcy's characters are placed into
the gilded cage of flowery narratives and left to suffer
unprecedented misfortunes (usually of the violent kind). Darcy,
"makes mad and beautiful work," says Alan Moore, comic book artist
and author of "The Watchmen" and "V for Vendetta."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, there is redemption here as well -- the handsome prince ready
with the restorative kiss, the fairy godmother waiting with wand
poised. Happy endings do come, but not without some sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the idea of the romantic tragedy, of everything being
pretty and perfect -- but then, if you look closer, there's some
hidden sadness beneath," says Darcy of her stories. "I'm sort of a
pathetic sap that way. I wanted the book to be like that, to have
that kind of bittersweet nostalgia."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What happened to Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda followers after the
U.S. bombing of Afghanistan?</LD>
<LD>   After Bin Laden's apparent resurfacing via an audiotape released
last week and the FBI's warnings of possible "spectacular" terrorist
attacks, that question has gained renewed emphasis. Tonight's
"Frontline" documentary, "In Search of Al Qaeda" (9 p.m., KCET; 10
p.m., KVCR), seeks the answer, with fascinating but not entirely
satisfying results.</LD>
<LD>   For as undeniably brave and determined as producer-writer-reporter
Martin Smith and co-producer-director Marcela Gaviria were in
pursuing the story, their effort tends to feel more like a series of
disconnected vignettes than a structured whole.</LD>
<TE>   Still, it contains considerable insights. Traveling from London to
Pakistan to the Gulf of Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Smith
interviews an array of subjects, from villagers to national and
religious leaders, on topics ranging from their stances toward Al
Qaeda to the difficulties of finding terrorist suspects.</TE>
<TE>   To American ears, many comments can be startling: "I didn't used
to think I could support violence," says Rahma Hugira, an advocate
for Yemen's detained Al Qaeda suspects. "When I saw the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon burn, I cried, I fainted with joy."</TE>
<TE>   To American eyes, many images can be remarkable: There's footage
from inside Pakistan's independent Pashtun tribal regions, where many
experts suggest Bin Laden could be hiding. The area is closed to
outsiders, so Smith trained a Pashtun journalist to film there.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, no one can fault Smith and Gaviria for coming up with
more questions than answers, but the program could have used a better
framework.</TE>

<LD>"Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"</LD>
<LD>   Matt Damon (narration); Bryan Adams (songs)</LD>
<LD>   DreamWorks/Universal $27 DVD; $25 VHS</LD>
<TE>   The digital edition of DreamWorks' beautifully rendered animated
tale of a magnificent mustang includes a course on how to draw a
horse; a decent documentary on how "Spirit" integrated hand-drawn and
computer-generated animation; storyboards; and decent commentary with
the directors, Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook, and producer Mirelle
Soira.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD-ROM is the highlight of the disc, "Spirit's Make-a-Movie
Studio," in which you can choose your own backgrounds, sounds,
characters, music and clips from the film to create your own
production. The DVD-ROM also enables you to create your own poster
based on your movie and invitations to the "premiere" of your film.</TE>

<TE>   "Sunshine State"</TE>
<TE>   Edie Falco, Bill Cobbs</TE>
<TE>   Columbia TriStar, $25</TE>
<TE>   John Sayles' films are always interesting and though this lengthy
ensemble production isn't one of his best, there are some inspired
set pieces and nice performances from Falco, Cobbs, Mary Steenburgen,
Angela Bassett, Timothy Hutton and Alan King. The low-key DVD
includes a wide-screen edition of the film, the trailer and erudite
commentary from the soft-spoken Sayles, one of our premiere
independent filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Notorious C.H.O"</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Cho</TE>
<TE>   Wellspring, $20</TE>
<TE>   Korean American comedian Margaret Cho's appeal is a matter of
taste. There are those who find her frank talk of sexuality a ribald
hoot; others will find it more tasteless than funny. And the same can
be said of this concert film taped last year in Seattle. The DVD
includes deleted scenes with the Korean-born parents she's always
imitating; a politically incorrect but funny animated film, "Grocery
Store"; an interview with Cho; and a brief "making of" featurette.</TE>

<LD>At-home defibrillators -- A story in Monday's Health section on
at-home defibrillators said that Dr. Vinay Nadkarni, chairman of the
emergency cardiovascular care committee of the American Heart Assn.
in Dallas, recommended contacting the Red Cross for training in the
use of defibrillators. Although Nadkarni recommended training, he did
not recommend a specific organization. People who want training,
however, may get it through the American Red Cross or the American
Heart Assn.'s Heartsaver CPR course.</LD>

<HD>'Less Flashy' CEO Builds AOL Turnaround Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rock music still rumbles down the halls of America Online
headquarters, but the mood inside the offices of the Internet giant
seems closer to the blues.</LD>
<LD>   AOL Chief Executive Jonathan Miller, who has been on the job three
months, already has imposed a decidedly more somber, business-like
approach in the Internet division of AOL Time Warner Inc. This week
he laid off 90 employees in AOL's ad sales divisions in Dulles, Va.,
and New York. He canceled the company's annual holiday party, saying
a celebration "flies in the face" of the serious challenges the
company is facing. Among them: a government investigation of its
accounting practices and slowing subscriber growth.</LD>
<LD>   For a newcomer, Miller has spent surprisingly little time
schmoozing with employees, instead devoting himself to developing a
turnaround plan that he is scheduled to present today during a
meeting with AOL Time Warner's board of directors.</LD>
<TE>   Miller stands in stark contrast to some of the company's recently
departed leaders, including AOL Time Warner Chairman Bob Pittman, who
was criticized for setting overly ambitious targets, and Internet
programming head Jimmy de Castro, who piped in the rock music and led
a high-energy exercise class in the morning to help boost morale.</TE>
<TE>   "He's unlike previous AOL executives, and that's a good thing,"
said Kaufman Bros. analyst Paul Kim. "He's less flashy. Less
arrogant. And less dictatorial."</TE>
<TE>   Miller's long-awaited blueprint to revive AOL reflects some of his
no-nonsense, practical style. "It's not a silver bullet," said a
source briefed on the proposal. "It's a modest plan, but a realistic
one."</TE>
<TE>   The plan proposes cutting costs, focusing less on ad sales and
expanding America Online's sagging high-speed service by developing
exclusive programs. They would rely partly on AOL Time Warner's own
stable of entertainment companies, according to sources familiar with
the details.</TE>
<TE>   It also proposes creating several premium services, which will
cost subscribers more than AOL's standard Internet product but could
offer more compelling features, such as sneak peaks at upcoming
movies, exclusive interviews and the ability to download music,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Boosting America Online's e-commerce business through new
partnerships with retailers is another key component. One strategy is
to create a platform on the AOL service on which small and
medium-sized sellers can offer various products directly to consumers
at fixed, discounted prices. Miller also is pushing AOL to sprinkle
sales opportunities throughout the online service -- for instance,
pitching CDs to subscribers who visit AOL's music site -- rather than
confine them to a separate shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, former head of Barry Diller's USA Interactive, is set to
lay out his vision with his boss, AOL Time Warner senior executive
Don Logan, at an AOL Time Warner board meeting at America Online
headquarters in Dulles. The board is expected to approve the plan,
and specifics are to be publicly announced Dec. 3 during a
presentation to Wall Street analysts.</TE>
<TE>   AOL officials declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The plan does not include any major surprises or drastic changes
to the approach already being pursued by Miller and Ted Leonsis, a
longtime AOL executive who recently stepped back into a more active
role as vice chairman of the Internet unit. Both men have been
working since September to develop a strategy to shift America Online
away from its dependence on aggressive advertising deals, which dried
up with the dot-com bust and now are the target of a criminal
investigation by the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Due largely to a growth slowdown and accounting problems at the
Internet division, AOL Time Warner stock has lost half its value
since the beginning of the year.Shares closed Wednesday at $14.80,
down 17 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say they are looking forward to hearing the details of
Miller's plan, but don't expect any quick fixes.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect to be underwhelmed," Kim said. "There's not much they
can do. Execution will matter a lot. But I still think subscriptions
numbers could turn negative next year."</TE>
<TE>   Miller's proposal is the latest of several turnaround efforts
launched over the last year, including one by Pittman that called for
AOL to temporarily de-emphasize the high-speed product.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is taking the opposite tack, attempting to address a common
Wall Street refrain that America Online lacks a clear broadband
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the company has started rolling out new
high-speed features, including a broadband radio with CD-quality
sound and AOL Live, which features online entertainment programs,
similar to television shows. At the same time, beta testing for a
long-delayed music subscription service is underway and expected to
be unveiled shortly.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Developer Faces $184-Million Verdict</HD>
<DH>Alan Casden is expected to appeal the award to investors in
his apartment-complex partnerships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles jury has awarded $184 million in damages to former
investors in a series of limited partnerships run by Los Angeles
apartment tycoon Alan I. Casden.</LD>
<LD>   The jury Tuesday awarded $92 million in punitive damages to about
18,000 investors who sold their interests in Casden-run partnerships
that owned apartment complexes. It came four days after the same
panel granted $92 million in general damages to the investors after
finding Casden and his associates at Casden Properties Inc. guilty of
violating federal securities laws and breaching their fiduciary
duties.</LD>
<LD>   The case is the first of its type to be tried for damages since
the passage of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995. The law
was intended to prevent frivolous class-action suits by making it
more difficult for lawyers to file them, according to the investors'
New York law firm, Goodkind Labaton Rudoff &amp; Sucharow.</LD>
<TE>   Casden Properties is owned by Denver-based Apartment Investment &amp;
Management Co., which bought closely held Casden in March for more
than $800 million. Aimco said it's not liable for the award.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Chimicles, who represented some of the investors, agreed
that Aimco is "fully indemnified" from the judgments and that it's
the individual defendants, including Casden, who are on the hook for
the damages.</TE>
<TE>   Casden is expected to appeal the awards.</TE>
<TE>   "It was excessive and inappropriate and not supported either by
the facts or the law," Casden spokeswoman Barbara Casey said.</TE>
<TE>   The 56-year-old Casden is listed on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy
Americans with an estimated net worth of $800 million. He has
developed or acquired about 90,000 apartment units, mostly in
Southern California, since the 1970s. In addition to building
market-rate apartments, including a luxury project recently completed
next to Park La Brea in Los Angeles, Casden has been heavily involved
in developing affordable housing financed in part with tax credits.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of securities class-action lawsuits are settled
before trial, experts said. But Casden, who has a reputation as a
scrappy negotiator, apparently thought he could win in court.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the danger of going to the jury in the current climate,
where investors are feeling so cheated and wronged," said Jim Newman,
executive director of Rockville, Md.-based Securities Class Action
Services, which tracks class-action suits.</TE>
<TE>   The Casden lawsuit, filed in 1998, charged that Casden Properties
unlawfully made misleading statements in seeking investors' votes to
approve a transfer of ownership in 98 apartment-complex partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "Our expert says they were shortchanged by about $77 million,"
noted plaintiffs lawyer Lawrence Sucharow.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Alan Casden, who owned National Partnership
Investments Corp., the managing general partner for the investors
group, other defendants included his brother Henry Casden, Bruce
Nelson and Charles Boxenbaum. Those three were officers or directors
of National Partnership.</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 transaction transferred the apartment partnerships to
Casden Properties, which also acquired National Partnership.</TE>
<TE>   The apartment complexes in the lawsuit are mostly California
properties that are considered affordable for low-income tenants. The
limited partnership interests "were acquired with substantial due
diligence and backed up with fairness opinions," Casey said. "Three
years later we sold them for less than we paid."</TE>
<TE>   In January 1999 Casden Properties completed a private stock
offering worth $390 million, which converted the firm to a private
real estate investment trust.</TE>
<TE>   Aimco shares rose 10 cents to $37.60 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Housing Starts Fall in October</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Aversa</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Housing construction lost momentum in October, plunging by 11.4%, the
government reported Wednesday. It is the biggest drop since 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Yet even with the sharp decline, which came after the level of
housing construction shot up to a 16-year high in September, the
number of housing units for which builders broke ground in October
still is considered to be in the healthy zone.</LD>
<LD>   Builders began work on 1.6 million housing units, at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate, representing an 11.4% decline in October from
the previous month, the Commerce Department reported.</LD>
<TE>   While October's housing activity level was weaker than analysts
were expecting, economists predicted September's red-hot pace could
not be sustained. Housing construction jumped by 11% in September to
a rate of 1.8 million units, the highest level since December 1986.</TE>
<TE>   The drop in October marked the biggest decline since January 1994
and the number of units under construction was the lowest since
April.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is that the level of housing activity is still very
strong, but the bad news is housing construction is probably maxed
out in terms of how much it will contribute to economic growth," said
Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.</TE>
<TE>   "The housing construction market is in good shape, but September
was probably the high-water mark," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's report said construction of new single-family homes
fell 7% in October to a rate of 1.35 million. Work on apartments,
condominiums and other multifamily housing plummeted by 31.4% to a
rate of 221,000 last month.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the slowdown in construction in October, the housing
market remains in good shape. Stoked by low mortgage rates, home
sales are expected to post records this year.</TE>
<TE>   The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 5.94%
last week, the lowest level since mortgage giant Freddie Mac began
tracking these rates in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   In the Northeast, housing construction in October fell 18.8% from
the previous month to a rate of 143,000. In the Midwest, construction
dropped by 19.5% to a rate of 301,000. In the South, construction was
down by 14.3% to a rate of 701,000.</TE>
<TE>   But in the West, housing construction rose 3.6% to a rate of
458,000.</TE>
<TE>   Housing permits, a good barometer of demand, rose 1.7% in October
to a rate of 1.76 million, an encouraging sign, economists said.</TE>

<HD>Justices to Review Edison Bailout</HD>
<DH>The California Supreme Court says it will rule on potential
violations of state law by the PUC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Debora Vrana</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Supreme Court said Wednesday that it would review whether
the bailout plan that allowed Southern California Edison to help pay
off its debt during the energy crisis was made in violation of the
state's open-meeting law or the 1996 energy deregulation act.</LD>
<LD>   If the court finds that violations occurred, the rescue plan could
be voided -- meaning lower rates for customers and possible refunds,
according to consumer advocates. It also could wreak havoc for
Edison, which has been recovering from its precarious financial
position during the 2000-01 energy crisis with the help of the
bailout plan.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a great deal of uncertainty about what will happen if
they say this pact violates state law," said Roger Berliner, an
energy lawyer who represents Los Angeles County before federal
regulators. "Edison doesn't have a lot of options."</LD>
<TE>   The state high court said it would rule on potential violations of
state law by the California Public Utilities Commission in hammering
out the agreement behind closed doors in October 2001. The deal
allowed the state's second-largest utility to keep electricity rates
at current high levels until it had paid off the billions in debt it
incurred during the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in September rejected
federal law challenges to the rescue plan but asked the state high
court to rule on the possible violation of the open-meeting law and
of the landmark law that deregulated the state's investor-owned
utilities.</TE>
<TE>   "This is good. The court will find this settlement was legally and
procedurally flawed," said Nettie Hoge, executive director of the
Utility Reform Network, the San Francisco consumer advocacy group
that challenged the Edison rescue.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison President Robert G. Foster said the
charges were baseless.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to briefing the court on the validity of the
judgment confirming our settlement agreement" with the PUC, he said
in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC, said the panel was
pleased that the court agreed to review whether the bailout plan was
reached properly.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that the highest court in the state is in the best
position to decide these critical issues of state law," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a unanimous decision in September, the federal appeals court
said that by reaching an agreement in closed session, the PUC may
have violated the state law that requires the panel to meet publicly
when it discusses rate changes. The court also found that the PUC may
have violated the state's 1996 deregulation law by raising rates and
giving Edison until 2005 to pay off debts incurred in the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no specific date when the court will begin
hearing arguments, the case could begin in the spring, sources on
both sides said.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 1, the utility, a unit of Edison International of
Rosemead, posted a third-quarter profit of $352 million, compared
with a $413-million loss a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to review the case was posted on the Supreme Court's
Web site shortly before the market closed. Edison International
shares were up 28 cents at $11.65 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>State Granted Access to Files of Power Suppliers</HD>
<DH>Federal regulators agree to allow California to submit
evidence of market manipulation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar and Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a victory for California, federal regulators agreed Wednesday to
allow state officials to submit evidence of market manipulation by
energy companies as they seek to win $9 billion in refunds for
excessive power costs.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, responding to a court
ruling, unanimously agreed to institute a special 100-day "discovery"
period for state officials to access the records of power suppliers.
As part of the discovery, the state will be able to look for -- and
submit to FERC -- any evidence of market manipulation by energy
companies. Such evidence had previously been ruled off-limits.</LD>
<LD>   Any evidence developed during the discovery process would be
considered by the full FERC board when it makes its final
determination on refunds for California, most likely in the spring.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to put this thing to bed," said FERC Chairman Patrick H.
Wood III, referring to the politically charged litigation resulting
from the California debacle. "People have a right to justice."</TE>
<TE>   California officials and utility executives were pleased by the
decision, saying it should strengthen the case for refunds. The order
allows the state to submit documents in the refund case that have
been subpoenaed in various investigations into market manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   "The order, and the federal appeals court ruling it implements,
vindicate the position we have taken all along -- that FERC had
ignored substantial evidence of market misconduct in calculating, and
limiting, our refunds," California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said.
"Hopefully, the end result of today's order will be to increase the
compensation California electricity consumers receive from the power
sellers that gouged them during the energy crisis."</TE>
<TE>   In August, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco
agreed with California officials that the scope of the FERC
proceeding into refunds should be expanded to take into account
alleged market manipulation. However, the court left it to the agency
to set up a process for developing new evidence and bringing it into
the refund case.</TE>
<TE>   Generators had argued for a narrow window, saying the new
discovery duplicates and conflicts with a continuing FERC
investigation into market manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   But FERC adopted important elements of the framework proposed by
California officials. As the state had requested, the parties in the
case will have a full 100 days to probe for new evidence of
misconduct during the period from Jan. 1, 2000, to June 20, 2001,
when federal price limits went into effect.</TE>
<TE>   The refund case is complex because it involves poring over reams
of data on hourly prices for wholesale electricity to ascertain
whether they were fair.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the process involved computing what would have been a
"just and reasonable" price and then comparing that with actual
prices charged during the height of the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Power sellers repeatedly have denied manipulating electricity
prices during the state's energy crisis, but evidence has emerged of
questionable conduct.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Enron Corp.'s head of Western power trading pleaded
guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud for his role in dubious
trading schemes, and several energy-trading firms have admitted that
employees lied about prices to trade publications that compile
influential price indexes.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, who has criticized FERC as slow to respond to
California's problems, again blasted the commission.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad we have to go to court to get FERC to do the right
thing," the governor said in a statement. "At least the 9th Circuit
understands what FERC still doesn't seem to: The electricity market
was manipulated and California is still owed billions. The question
remains: Why is FERC protecting the energy companies and not
California ratepayers?"</TE>
<TE>   Carl W. Wood, a member of the California Public Utilities
Commission, called the FERC ruling "useful as far as it goes" but
said he would have preferred FERC to enforce 2-year-old subpoenas
from the state PUC that generators have ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "We will get boxes and boxes of information" because of the new
discovery, Wood said. "To pull this stuff together and make any sense
out of it probably can't be done" in the 100 days.</TE>
<TE>   FERC spokesman Kevin Cadden said the commission gave the state
what it asked for and was working to bring the matter to a close
because "we want to bring certainty to California customers and to
the marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   According to the FERC timetable, the fact-finding period will
close Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Alonso-Zaldivar reported from Washington and Rivera Brooks from
Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>UFO Secures Second Round of Financing</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bucking an industry trend that has left many tech firms starved for
cash, a broadband service provider has secured $10 million in venture
capital to expand into the Los Angeles and Dallas markets.</LD>
<LD>   Unlimited Fiber Optic Communications of San Francisco, which
offers high-speed data and video transmission for corporations, said
this week that it got its second round of financing from a group that
includes San Diego-based Sorrento Networks Corp. and Brentwood-based
venture capital firm Kline Hawkes.</LD>
<LD>   The stock market slump and the slide in business capital spending
have left investors loath to finance tech and telecom firms.</LD>
<TE>   In the third quarter, telecom and networking venture funding fell
by about one-third from the second quarter, according to the
MoneyTree survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Venture Economics and the
National Venture Capital Assn.</TE>
<TE>   UFO plans a major push next year in the L.A. market aimed at
businesses such as media firms, which might use the service to
transmit raw film footage known as dailies, Chief Executive Charlie
Schoenhoeft said.</TE>
<TE>   UFO, founded in January 2000, operates optical networks in San
Francisco and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   British Telecom's broadcasting operation in Marina del Rey has
been using UFO's equipment for several months to transmit video,
Schoenhoeft said, but the new financing will help UFO utilize the
rest of its L.A. fiber network.</TE>
<TE>   UFO has unused fiber "built into" more than 40 TV, film and
post-production studios around L.A., he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kline Hawkes partner Jay Ferguson said his firm believes "the
story has gotten better" for UFO because many rivals have fallen by
the wayside.</TE>

<HD>Strong Sales Help Hot Topic Beat Forecasts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teen retailer Hot Topic Inc. reported Wednesday better-than-expected
third-quarter net income, which the company said was due to strong
Halloween and back-to-school sales.</LD>
<LD>   For the quarter ended Nov. 2, net income was $10 million, or 31
cents a share, compared with $8.5 million, or 26 cents, a year
earlier. The results beat analysts' expectations by a penny.</LD>
<LD>   Sales rose 33% to $122.6 million. Sales at stores open at least a
year, a key industry indicator, increased 6.3%</LD>
<TE>   All per-share figures reflect a 3-for-2 stock split Feb. 7.</TE>
<TE>   The City of Industry-based company, which sells music-themed
clothes and accessories to teens, also announced the resignation of
Tom Rail, who had been general manager of its Torrid stores, a
concept launched last year to sell trendy clothes to plus-size girls
and young women.</TE>
<TE>   The company said Rail's departure was "a mutual decision." Rail,
who resigned last week, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   His duties will be assumed by Chief Executive Betsy McLaughlin
until a replacement is named.</TE>
<TE>   Rail's departure initially raised questions about whether there
might be a problem with Torrid, or whether McLaughlin might be
weighed down by the additional duties. But analyst Elizabeth Pierce,
of Wedbush Morgan Securities, said the company had allayed her
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not looking at Tom's resignation as any indication that they
are not as gung-ho about Torrid as they were two years ago," Pierce
said. "Nor do I believe it will impact Hot Topic's business."</TE>
<TE>   Hot Topic also announced plans to open 25 Torrid stores next year.
Company spokesman Jay Johnson said the openings, which would double
the size of the Torrid chain, reflected the company's confidence in
the concept.</TE>
<TE>   The company also operates 419 Hot Topic stores in 48 states.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the company was optimistic about the upcoming holiday
season. Although there is lingering weakness in sales of young men's
pants, sales of women's apparel and accessories have remained solid,
the retailer said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the company has attracted young shoppers, while other

<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. said Wednesday that it is beginning to realize
financial benefits from its merger this year with Compaq Computer
Corp. and announced earnings of $390 million, or 13 cents a share, in
its fiscal fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The computer manufacturer cut losses in its personal and corporate
computing businesses despite a slight dip in revenue to $18.05
billion for the three months ended Oct. 31. Had Palo Alto-based HP
and Compaq been operating as a single company in last year's fourth
quarter, they would have recorded a loss of $505 million, or 17 cents
a share, on sales of $18.17 billion. The acquisition closed in May.</LD>
<LD>   "The results we're announcing today, six months after the launch
(of the merged company), validate that vision and demonstrate just
how much progress we've made toward achieving our goals," HP Chief
Executive Carly Fiorina said in a conference call with analysts.</LD>
<TE>   "Despite the complexity of this task and the realities of the
challenge in [technology] markets, we are meeting or exceeding all of
our integration targets," she said.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares jumped about 10% to $18.60 in after-hours trading
Wednesday after the results were released. They had gained 30 cents
to $16.85 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   For the full year, HP earned $2.4 billion, or 79 cents a share, on
sales of $72.3 billion, including results from both HP and Compaq.
That compares with a combined profit of $2.48 billion on $81 billion
in sales for fiscal 2001.</TE>
<TE>   For the first quarter of fiscal year 2003, the company said it is
on track to meet Wall Street estimates of $18.4 billion in revenue
and earnings of 27 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   HP's revenue grew in all segments: enterprise systems, including
high-end servers, storage systems and software; personal systems,
including desktop, laptop and hand-held computers; and imaging
products, including printers, scanners and digital cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Although it continued to lose money in the key enterprise and
personal computing businesses, HP cut operating losses in those units
by 64% and 56%, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Since the merger, HP said it has aligned its global sales force,
reduced inventories and introduced more than 100 products.</TE>
<TE>   HP also said it exceeded its work force and cost-reduction
targets, trimming 12,500 jobs instead of the 10,000 it had promised
by the end of October, and slashing costs by $651 million, ahead of
the $500 million it previously had pledged.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have a lot of work to do," Fiorina said. "But our
strategy is working, we're executing well, and we're picking up
momentum."</TE>

<HD>Stocks Gain Despite Down News</HD>
<DH>Technology issues lead a broad rally. Investors brush aside
a drop in housing starts and rise in oil prices, hoping it's the
season for a rebound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks staged a broad advance Wednesday, shaking off some downbeat
economic news and another rise in oil prices.</LD>
<LD>   A rally in technology stocks lifted the Nasdaq composite index
44.84 points, or 3.3%, to 1,419.35, the highest close since Aug. 22.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 148.23 points, or 1.8%, to
8,623.01, though it remains below its recent closing high of 8,771.01
set Nov. 6.</LD>
<TE>   A report Wednesday that housing starts plunged in October did not
appear to trigger serious concerns about the economy, even though it
followed a warning Tuesday from Home Depot that it will miss sales
growth targets this year.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said institutional investors were taking their cues
less from the news than from the calendar. The stock market has
entered what has historically been its strongest period of the year:
November through January.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the season when stocks do better ... when people become
more optimistic about the coming year and they become more aggressive
in buying stocks," said Bill Barker, strategist at brokerage RBC Dain
Rauscher in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Major indexes hit five-year lows in early October, resurged
through early November and have since been trading largely in a
sideways pattern.</TE>
<TE>   The rebound from the October lows has whetted the appetites of
fund managers who are eager to erase some of the steep losses they
have suffered this year, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq has surged 27.4% since bottoming on Oct. 9, though it
remains down 27.2% year to date. The Dow is up 18.3% from its low.
And the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 -- which on Wednesday rose 17.41
points, or 1.9%, to 914.15 -- is up 17.7% from its low.</TE>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and on Nasdaq, as trading volume rose.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the psychology of the marketplace is positive. And
people are concerned about getting left behind right now," said Brian
Bush, head of equity research at Stephens Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Near-term oil futures gained 56 cents to $26.98 a barrel
Wednesday, a three-week high, after President Bush again warned Iraq
that it would face "the severest of consequences" if it failed to
comply with United Nations weapon inspections.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, Treasury yields rose as some investors turned
to higher-yielding corporate issues. The 10-year T-note yield rose to
4.06% from 3.98% Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Recent reports on consumer confidence and retail sales are
"pointing to a gradual recovery," which is good for the corporate
bond market, Michael Kastner, who manages $10 billion in bonds at
Deutsche Bank Private Banking, told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on "junk" corporate bond issues -- those rated below
investment grade -- have fallen sharply recently, reflecting more
optimism about the economy. The yield on the KDP Investment Advisors
index of 100 junk issues has dropped to 10.8% from 12.3% in
mid-October.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights of the day:</TE>
<TE>   * Semiconductor stocks were boosted by Analog Devices' report that
its sales rose for the first time in six quarters. Analog jumped
$1.81 to $29.81.</TE>
<TE>   Among other chip makers, Intel rose $1 to $19.15 and Texas
Instruments gained $1.24 to $18.42. Semiconductor manufacturing
equipment maker KLA Tencor surged $3.03 to $39.82.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks were strong. Merrill Lynch jumped $2 to $41,
Citigroup gained $1.35 to $37.79 and XL Capital advanced $2.48 to
$80.15.</TE>
<TE>   * Housing stocks rallied despite the news on October new-home
starts. KB Home added 65 cents to $43.54, Pulte Homes jumped $1.35 to
$44.80 and Lennar gained $1.33 to $52.45.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Maytag jumped $2.61 to $27.40 after reiterating its 2003
earnings estimate of $3.10 to $3.20 a share.</TE>
<TE>   * Phelps Dodge slumped $2.18 to $26.72. The mining firm said it
was contacted as part of an investigation by U.S. and European
regulators into possible price fixing in the carbon-black market.
Carbon black is used in inks and tires.</TE>

<HD>Restoration Hardware Loss Narrows on Housing Boom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wires</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Restoration Hardware Inc., an upscale home furnishings retailer, on
Wednesday said that its third-quarter loss narrowed sharply from a
year ago, as sales at stores open at least a year climbed amid
booming housing and domestic goods markets.</LD>
<LD>   The Corte Madera, Calif.-based chain of 105 stores said its net
loss was $2.4 million, or 8 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$8.7 million, or 36 cents a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Direct-to-customer sales, which include catalog and Internet, rose
66% to $10.9 million in the third quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Net sales in the third quarter were $90.7 million, a 20% increase
versus net sales of $75.5 million a year earlier. Comparable store
sales for the third quarter increased 14.8%.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the numbers this quarter demonstrate that our strategy to
reposition the Restoration Hardware brand and return the company to
profitability is working," said Gary Friedman, the company's
president and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 7, the company warned of a loss of about 8 cents a share
-- wider than its prior projection of a loss of between 5 cents and 6
cents, due to lower-than-expected merchandise margins.</TE>
<TE>   Restoration Hardware's chief financial officer, Kevin Shahan, said
he expects a profit of 41 cents to 42 cents a share in the fourth
quarter, contrasted with a loss of 45 cents a year ago, when results
were hurt by one-time write-offs.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that on the basis of third-quarter results and
current trends, he expects fourth-quarter sales to increase 12% to
14% over the same period a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Comparable store sales for the holiday period are forecast to be
in the mid- to high-single digit range, with comparable store sales
for the quarter in the high-single to low-double digits, Shahan
added.</TE>

<HD>Delta IV's First Launch Provides a Lift to Boeing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than $1.5 billion in development costs, a year of delays
and with much of its reputation on the line, Boeing Co. on Wednesday
successfully launched its new Delta IV rocket, putting the company
back in the race against its archrival Lockheed Martin Corp. for
supremacy in space.</LD>
<LD>   Powered by the nation's first new rocket engine in nearly three
decades, the Delta IV took off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., at 2:39
p.m. PST. It placed a European communications satellite in orbit 37
minutes later, lifting the prospects for Boeing's hobbled launch
business.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of Boeing workers in Huntington Beach who were watching
the launch outdoors on a jumbo TV screen erupted in loud cheers as
the mission controller announced, "We have liftoff!"</LD>
<TE>   More than 5,000 Boeing engineers and designers work on the rocket
program in Huntington Beach and Canoga Park.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a beautiful launch," said Will Trafton, president of
Boeing's Launch Services unit. "This is a new day. We proved a lot to
the industry."</TE>
<TE>   The Delta IV's success means Boeing can better compete with
Lockheed to win more launch contracts from the Air Force, which is
the primary customer for the foreseeable future given the meltdown of
the U.S. telecommunications business and the resulting slump in the
commercial satellite industry.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Lockheed successfully launched its new rocket, the
Atlas V, and a Delta IV failure would have put in jeopardy Boeing's
prospects for launches worth as much as $40 billion over the next 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   "It was extremely important for Boeing to get it right," said
Marshall H. Kaplan, a former rocket engineer and now director of
space programs for Strategic Insight Ltd., a Crystal City, Va.,
consulting and research firm. "They've had a lot of problems, so they
needed to have a successful launch if they wanted to keep up" with
Lockheed.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing had so much riding on Wednesday's launch in part because
its previous model, the Delta III, had a terrible flight record.</TE>
<TE>   The first two Delta III launches were failures: The first rocket
exploded in flight, and a crack in the second rocket's engine
resulted in a satellite being put into the wrong orbit, costing
Boeing nearly $500 million. To prove it could get the Delta III off
the ground, Boeing had to pay for the third launch, which was
successful.</TE>
<TE>   To help spur development of a new generation of lower-cost
rockets, the Pentagon gave Boeing and Lockheed $500 million to help
cover the cost of design work.</TE>
<TE>   The rival rockets, officially dubbed Evolved Expendable Launch
Vehicles, were developed to launch satellites and other payloads and
represent the most significant overhaul of the U.S. launch system
since the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force, which wants to use the rockets to launch satellites
for spying, weather forecasting, communications, navigation and other
experiments, has relied on Lockheed's Titan IV to launch its larger,
sophisticated satellites. Each Titan mission, however, costs about
$400 million, significantly more than the $100 million to $150
million per launch for the new rockets.</TE>
<TE>   Most rocket engines have been derivatives of technologies
developed in the '50s when aerospace companies began designing
ballistic missiles to deliver nuclear warheads. Analysts said Boeing
took a greater risk on the Delta IV, electing to create an entirely
new rocket engine, the first in three decades.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Boeing spent more than $1.5 billion, including $500
million developing the Delta IV's RS-68 engine in Canoga Park, as
well as constructing new launch pads at Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg
Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County. The Delta IV uses liquid
hydrogen fuel; the Atlas V relies on a Russian engine design that
burns kerosene.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's launch was a welcome relief to both Boeing and the Air
Force, which was so concerned that the Delta IV program was falling
behind schedule that it considered shifting more work to Lockheed.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing delayed the Delta IV launch numerous times in the last year
because of both software glitches and hardware problems.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing was scheduled to launch the Delta IV on Saturday, but
blast-off was delayed to Tuesday, only to have minor mechanical
problems and high winds prompt launch managers to once again scrub
the mission.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing closed up 33 cents to $31.73 the New York Stock Exchange.
The launch came after the market closed.</TE>

<HD>Giuliani Makes WorldCom Control an Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Powell</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc.'s incoming Chairman and Chief Executive Michael
Capellas may not have realized that control of the scandal-plagued
telecom giant was still up for grabs when he took the job.</LD>
<LD>   With former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's name being tossed
about as a possible chairman, some industry experts say former
Hewlett-Packard Co. President Capellas might walk away if the issue
of who will be chairman isn't settled soon.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a bigger-than-life soap opera and awkward for Capellas
because it's difficult to have two strong captains on the bridge,
which is why Capellas left HP," said Jeff Kagan, a telecommunications
analyst.</LD>
<TE>   Although Giuliani said it's premature to talk about his candidacy
for chairmanship, he said Wednesday that WorldCom should have a
separate chairman and CEO. He also said that his Giuliani Partners
consulting firm is advising on how WorldCom should be reorganized.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Capellas, who was only named to lead WorldCom on
Friday, is being quizzed less about his turnaround plan than he is
about Giuliani and Giuliani's backer, bond investor David Matlin.</TE>
<TE>   Matlin reportedly wants to use his newly acquired status as one of
WorldCom's biggest stakeholders to install Giuliani as chairman. That
would deny Capellas a coveted title he had been promised and would
raise questions about who's actually going to control WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   "If this issue gets to be bigger than it should be, Capellas could
say, 'I didn't get all that was agreed to,' and he could exit stage
left," said Frank Dzubeck, a telecom industry consultant.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain: WorldCom's governance and power structure is
complicated and unsettled.</TE>
<TE>   The company operates under the eye of two federal judges, a
court-appointed monitor and a creditors' committee. And it's unclear
who will hold the bulk of equity in WorldCom if it emerges from
bankruptcy protection: Some of the creditors who own a piece of the
company's $41-billion debt are likely to get a stake.</TE>
<TE>   "You have an incredibly complex kaleidoscope of governance and an
incoming CEO who is wondering what in the world he's in control of,"
said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, associate dean at Yale University School of
Management.</TE>
<TE>   Capellas is outlining his game plan this week in meetings with
customers and employees and couldn't be reached.</TE>

<LD>Mortgage.com Inc. says it's pulling out of a class-action suit
against Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. brought on behalf of 200
companies the bank took public and will file a new case.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit Mortgage.com, now MDCM Holdings Inc., is leaving
alleges that the U.S. unit of Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group
deliberately under-priced the initial stock offering in an attempt to
get kickbacks from investors.</LD>
<LD>   With the withdrawal of Mortgage.com, a Florida-based Internet
finance company, Credit Suisse said the case should be tossed out
unless a new lead plaintiff is found.</LD>

<LD>Federal regulators reversed themselves and reinstated a license for
Echo- Star Communications Corp. to launch a satellite with high-speed
Internet capabilities.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission in June revoked EchoStar's
license for using the high-speed Ka-band frequency because it said
the satellite TV company missed construction milestones.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar appealed and submitted a photograph of a satellite under
construction with the high-speed capability.</LD>
<TE>   The FCC said EchoStar should have supplied more thorough
documentation in the first place.</TE>

Sony Music Entertainment announced that it has acquired Run Tones
Inc., a privately held company developing wireless entertainment

<LD>   Sony Music's goal with the Run Tones acquisition is to gain core
technologies and expand its wireless efforts, said Thomas Gewecke,
senior vice president of Sony Music Digital Services.</LD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News/ Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co. said it will eliminate 5,000 more jobs next year in
addition to the nearly 30,000 cuts the aerospace company has made
since the 2001 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Half would be made through attrition and the rest through layoffs
in the commercial-airplane division, mainly in Washington state, the
company said, citing continued slow sales to ailing airlines.</LD>
<LD>   The cuts represent about 8% of the 65,000 employees at Boeing's
commercial-airplane business, which makes the 777 and 737 model
jetliners.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Boeing rose 33 cents to $31.73 on the New York Stock
Exchange before the announcement.</TE>

<LD>   Rates will rise Jan. 6 an average 3.5% at the FedEx Express
air-shipment unit for service within the U.S. and for U.S. exports, a

<LD>Porsche Design, the minimalist industrial design house founded and
run by automotive heir Ferdinand A. Porsche, is seeking a Southern
California location for its first satellite research and design
center.</LD>
<LD>   Jon McGowan, president of Porsche Design America, said the company
wants to start with a small facility next year staffed by two
designers who will transfer from Porsche Design headquarters in
Austria. Ultimately the California center could rival the parent
facility's size with 20 designers and support staff, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The company does design work in a variety of fields, including
transportation, electronics and health care, but is not part of the
car maker's regular design process.</LD>

<LD>The union representing 37,500 United Airlines machinists announced
tentative agreements on $1.5 billion in wage and benefit concessions,
giving United an important win in its effort to avoid a bankruptcy
filing.</LD>
<LD>   The International Assn. of Machinists was the only employee group
not to have committed to its share of $5.8 billion in labor cutbacks,
the centerpiece of United's financial recovery plan. IAM members will
vote Nov. 27 on the tentative agreements.</LD>
<LD>   United hopes the cuts are steep enough to persuade the government
to grant a $1.8-billion loan guarantee that it says it needs to stave
off a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by year's end.</LD>
<TE>   Shares in United parent UAL Corp. fell 23 cents, or 7%, to $3.10

<DL></DL>
<LD>PG&amp;E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric utility unit would receive the
lowest investment-grade ratings from Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch
Ratings under a reorganization plan submitted by state regulators.</LD>
<LD>   Standard &amp; Poor's would give most securities under the California
Public Utilities Commission's plan for the state's largest utility a
"marginal investment grade credit" rating, S&amp;P told the PUC in a
letter. S&amp;P's lowest investment-grade rating is BBB-minus. Fitch's
estimate for the securities was BBB, PUC general counsel Gary Cohen
said.</LD>
<LD>   The estimates were presented during a bankruptcy trial to decide
whether PG&amp;E's and the PUC's rival plans to rehabilitate Pacific Gas
are viable. Investment-grade ratings are crucial because many
institutional investors would require such ratings before purchasing
bonds issued under the plans.</LD>
<TE>   The ratings estimate is a "body blow" to the PUC's plan, said PG&amp;E
attorney Stephen Neal.</TE>

<LD>   The airline will begin in the spring with nonstop service between
Florida and the Northeast. Other areas will be added later. Most
one-way fares will be $79 to $299.</LD>
<LD>   The new venture is an attempt to win back customers from
faster-growing carriers such as Southwest Airlines Co. and JetBlue
Airways Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Delta shares fell 68 cents, or 6%, to $10.49 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Regulators Ready to Assess Fines</HD>
<DH>Twelve Wall Street investment banks could pay penalties
totaling as much as $1 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Settlement talks between securities regulators and Wall Street
investment banks will enter a crucial phase Friday when the
government begins telling the firms how much they would have to pay
to resolve investigations of stock-analyst conflicts, sources close
to the negotiations said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators will seek fines from 12 firms that could total as much
as $1 billion, the sources said. Regulators want Citigroup Inc. to
pay a fine of $300 million to $400 million, one source with knowledge
of the talks said. The nation's largest financial-services company
has been at the center of the investigations, most recently becoming
mired in a controversy over its chief executive's efforts to help the
children of a former employee gain entry to a preschool.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators plan to seek substantially smaller fines from other
firms, ranging from $25 million to $100 million, another source said.</LD>
<TE>   The discussion of monetary penalties is considered one of the
final steps toward reaching a "global" settlement of multiple
government investigations of conflicts of interest among Wall Street
analysts and the way shares of new-stock offerings were distributed
during the height of the 1990s bull market.</TE>
<TE>   It is unlikely that a deal could be reached by Thanksgiving, but
participants hope to hammer out an agreement by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Besides fines, regulators also would force the investment banks to
purchase stock research from independent firms and distribute it to
their customers alongside their own in-house stock reports, sources
said. The settlement also would implement new rules separating the
firms' investment-banking departments from their stock research
units.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal regulators will hold individual meetings with
the 12 companies Friday, Monday and Tuesday in New York and
Washington, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators will lay out the evidence assembled against each firm
and the legal charges they probably would bring if a settlement is
not reached. In addition to the fines, regulators will tell the
investment banks how much each would have to pay to fund the
independent research. Those subsidies could total an additional $1
billion.</TE>
<TE>   The penalties would be based on the degree of alleged wrongdoing,
though smaller firms would be assessed lesser amounts, sources said.
The firms would be given a few days to respond, presumably with
counteroffers.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators will meet Friday with Citigroup and with Credit Suisse
First Boston, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, sources said. They will
meet Monday with Goldman Sachs Group, another major Wall Street firm.
Spokespeople for the three companies declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In the plan for independent research, each firm would have to
appoint a monitor to oversee the purchase and distribution of stock
reports done by outside firms, sources said. The monitor would have
to be an outside consultant who is not on the firm's in-house staff,
sources said. The monitor would negotiate the cost of the independent
research and would have to attest to regulators that it is free of
conflicts with the brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   The fines paid by the firms would be split evenly between federal
regulators and the various states, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   The money going to the states would be used for various purposes,
including investor education and to bolster state budgets, some of
which are suffering deficits brought on by the weak economy.</TE>
<TE>   State officials considered setting up investor restitution funds,
but have decided against it because it would be too cumbersome and
costly, and it would be impossible to determine exactly who are
victims and how much they would be entitled to, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials are considering creating an investor restitution
fund, though no decisions have been made, sources said.</TE>

<HD>Philip Morris Packages Warn 'Light' Isn't Safer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Courtney Schlisserman</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Philip Morris Cos., the world's largest tobacco company,
is putting leaflets in its light, medium, mild and ultra-light
cigarette packs saying the products aren't safer than regular
cigarettes.</LD>
<LD>   The inserts will be in about 130 million packs, including Marlboro
Lights, sold in the U.S., to better educate smokers and encourage
finding a new method for determining tar ratings, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Packs with the leaflets started being sold in stores this month
and may be available until early next year depending on sales,
spokesman Brendan McCormick said.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no such thing as a safe cigarette," the leaflet reads,
and the terms "light," "ultra-light," "medium" and "mild" are meant
to describe taste.</TE>
<TE>   Cigarette makers were pushed by legislators and anti-smoking
groups to drop the labels after a National Cancer Institute report
indicated smokers found the descriptions misleading. The European
Union has banned the labels' use.</TE>
<TE>   "Philip Morris is supporting an ineffective alternative that would
preserve the status quo," Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign
for Tobacco-Free Kids, said. The company should fix advertising that
conveys they are less harmful, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris shares fell 27 cents to $37.83 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Philip Morris was ordered to pay $150 million to the
family of a smoker that claimed the company lied about the health
risks associated with low-tar products. The award was reduced to $100
million in May and the decision is being appealed.</TE>

<HD>Protecting U.S. Could Boost Tech Industries</HD>
<DH>Homeland Security may bring long-term increase in spending
on advanced gear and computers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jube Shiver Jr.</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The technology sector, beset by lackluster interest in
computers and other gadgets, could get a boost from the Senate's
passage of a homeland security measure that portends increased
government spending on anti-terrorism gear.</LD>
<LD>   The bill passed by the Senate late Tuesday calls for bringing
together 22 existing federal agencies into a massive new Department
of Homeland Security, which would require hundreds of millions of
dollars of new phones, computers and other items to get up and
running.</LD>
<LD>   Further down the road, the government is expected to spend even
greater sums on anti-terrorism research and on creating new
data-scrambling, surveillance and electronic screening devices.</LD>
<TE>   The House approved a similar bill last week, and President Bush is
expected to sign the measure into law before the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters see the government eventually playing a key role in
spawning an important new industry, much as it laid the foundation
for the Internet by developing a worldwide data network that could
survive a nuclear attack.</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts estimate that surveillance, identification and
intrusion-detection equipment sales and services could grow from less
than $16 billion annually to nearly $40 billion over the next five to
seven years. Those figures include government and private-sector
outlays.</TE>
<TE>   The homeland security measure is "a very big positive," said Barry
Leffew, a vice president at VeriSign Inc., a Mountain View, Calif.,
company that provides Web site authentication and security services.
"It could generate a very substantial" amount of business.</TE>
<TE>   Since terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners and slammed
three of them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon more than
a year ago, the nation can't seem to get its fill of anti-terrorism
protections.</TE>
<TE>   "There's certainly ... a lot of political pressure to raid the
Treasury and throw money at the problem" of security, said John Pike,
director of Global- security.org, a nonprofit Washington research
firm.</TE>
<TE>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service, for instance, has
begun directing universities to update their computer networks so
they can submit data on enrolled foreign students in encrypted form.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the Transportation Department has begun imposing new
security requirements on the nation's airports, rail and trucking
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   So far, companies providing equipment and services to airports
have been the main beneficiaries of the nation's increased vigilance.
But scores of other businesses also are hawking a wide range of
wares, including radar-tracking devices, electronic fingerprint
scanners and computer encryption software.</TE>
<TE>   One security company benefiting from the trend is TimeDomain Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The Huntsville, Ala.-based start-up recently won a $3-million
contract from the Pentagon to develop a radar tracking device for
military use. The company has been working on a technology called
ultra-wideband, which could provide a host of new wireless services
such as radar surveillance of intruders, locating buried earthquake
victims and greatly improving collision-avoidance systems.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a big emphasis on commercial, off-the-shelf solutions"
in government security contracts, said Jeff Ross, TimeDomain's vice
president of corporate development.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, some experts fear that the security mandates could
backfire in overspending and poor technology choices.</TE>
<TE>   "When the government starts putting its fingers in commercial
technologies, you are going to end up wasting a whole lot of taxpayer
money and end up with things that only bureaucrats love," said James
Gattuso, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
Washington think tank. Politicians, he added, will back "pet
projects" from entrepreneurs who "can't get funding for their ideas"
from the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Wall Street is not anticipating a financial bonanza
for the industry -- at least not right away.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of some security firms rose after the terrorism attacks
last year, but they soon lost steam as investors failed to see
sustained gains.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are in a 'show me the money' mode," said Timothy
Quillin, an analyst at Stephens Inc. in Little Rock, Ark.</TE>
<TE>   The government programs "are going to be relatively fragmented and
spread out over a long period of time," Quillin said. "After World
II, it took 12 years to put the Defense Department together. And I
think this is going to be just as long a process."</TE>
<TE>   Still, as Pike noted, the industry is at least starting to pick up
some significant momentum.</TE>
<TE>   To this point, "the government has had no real money to spend" on
anti-terrorism initiatives, he said. But with the Department of
Homeland Security almost a reality, "that could change soon."</TE>

<HD>Digital Cinema Shelves Plans to Sell Projectors</HD>
<DH>It will suspend sales to movie theaters while a group of
Hollywood studios hammer out technical standards and business models.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. Huffstutter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sluggish pace of Hollywood's transition from celluloid to digital
projection systems has prompted Technicolor Digital Cinema to put on
hold its plans to sell equipment to movie theaters, the company said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Burbank-based company, a joint effort between Technicolor and
cell phone giant Qualcomm Inc., said its decision to cut its business
development and marketing groups is an effort to please a consortium
of Hollywood studios that are trying to hammer out technical
standards and business models for digital cinema.</LD>
<LD>   "The [consortium] asked several vendors to wait because there's no
technology standards in place yet," said Dana Banks, a spokeswoman
for Technicolor, the leading film production and distribution
company. "Until we have a standard, we have a staff that has nothing
to do."</LD>
<TE>   Technicolor Digital Cinema has more than two dozen high-tech
projection systems installed in theaters nationwide, and the company
plans to maintain them.</TE>
<TE>   The company cut two staff positions but declined to say how many
employees remain in the unit. Technicolor is a Camarillo-based
division of Thomson Multimedia.</TE>
<TE>   Other digital cinema vendors, however, said Wednesday that they
are pushing forward with their efforts to roll out new projection
systems in the U.S. and overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Technicolor rival Avica Technology Corp. of Santa Monica has
installed numerous systems in Asia this year and expects to continue
to expand in that market, said President and Chief Executive Andrew
Maltz.</TE>
<TE>   "We were never contacted by the consortium about this," Maltz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Hollywood-based consortium, known as the
Digital Cinemas Initiatives, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of rolling film through a projector, the new breed of
equipment projects digitally rendered images onto big screens.
Instead of using celluloid reels, the machines allow digital files to
be sent electronically to theaters through high-speed data lines,
over satellite transmissions, or on computer discs or digital
videotape.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of the technology say it will rid movies of visual
problems, including wear that affects celluloid prints over time and
scratches and other on-screen flaws caused by mechanical projectors.</TE>
<TE>   The seven major studios created the Digital Cinemas Initiatives in
May to establish technology standards for digital movie projectors.
They also hoped to build a business model that will make it
profitable to distribute digital films electronically to the more
than 100,000 theaters worldwide. By eliminating film, studios expect
to save hundreds of millions of dollars in film-print production and
distribution costs.</TE>
<TE>   But the conversion costs are considerable. One of the biggest
roadblocks is determining who will pay the $150,000 fee for each
digital projector, along with the more than $20,000 per screen for
the computer that stores and feeds the movies. For Regal
Entertainment Group, the nation's largest movie theater chain with
more than 5,800 screens, the tab could exceed half a billion dollars.</TE>
<TE>   And though studios could save up to $1 billion in the U.S. alone
by replacing film with digital files, the financial benefits to
theaters are more subtle. Digital projectors can be operated and
maintained with fewer employees, and theaters could use the equipment
to show additional types of programming, such as sporting events and
rock concerts.</TE>
<TE>   All this leaves the consortium with much to figure out. Consortium
officials have said they expect to pick an engineering standard for
digital cinema by the end of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a prevailing view that, in film, we have an elegant
technology that we know how to use well and people are comfortable
with," said Charles S. Swartz, executive director of the
Entertainment Technology Center at USC. "It's going to take time for
people to replace that technology and agree on what is going to be
better than film."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Universal Music Group's IGA division was sued in New York by Jay
Faires, head of JCOR Records, who accused IGA of trying to drive him
out of business.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit stems from a dispute that began shortly after Faires
cut a distribution pact for JCOR with IGA, based in part on Faires'
claim that JCOR held a stake in Vagrant, home to such indie stars as
Dashboard Confessional and Saves the Day, sources said. IGA did not
renew its deal.</LD>
<LD>   But Faires' ties to Vagrant were called into question after he
tried to purchase a 50% stake at a later date.</LD>
<TE>   A competing distributor, TVT Records, produced legal papers
claiming that it owned distribution rights and the right to purchase
the 50% stake in Vagrant if there were any other suitors. A court
agreed and granted an injunction barring Faires from purchasing the
stake, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Vagrant soon became the target of a bidding war among several
labels. After negotiating a settlement with TVT, IGA then bought a
half-stake in Vagrant, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Faires, who accuses IGA of trying to force him out of business to
raid Vagrant, could not be reached for comment. IGA also could not be
reached.</TE>

<HD>Aid Helps Cash-Poor Through Home Door</HD>

<AU>Jon Cottin</AU>
<BD>Jon Cottin, an attorney and real estate agent, is
executive director of the Homeownership Alliance of Nonprofit
Downpayment Providers in Bethesda, Md.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The best-kept secret behind the sustained strength of the residential
real estate economy is that a new pool of buyers has been created
among Americans who can afford mortgage payments but lack the cash
for a down payment.</LD>
<LD>   Until a few years ago, these people were trapped in a financial
swamp, working two or more jobs, paying 60% of their incomes for
rent, saving nothing. They were effectively shut out of
homeownership.</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, this phenomenon tends to trap many minorities.</LD>
<TE>   The Department of Housing and Urban Development reported in July
that, largely because of the lack of down-payment assistance, the
rate of minorities who owned homes continued to lag behind the rate
of whites.</TE>
<TE>   This is important not only for those locked out of the American
dream but for the rest of us as well: The Bush administration and the
Federal Reserve have recognized that down-payment assistance is the
key to driving up the homeownership rate while re-energizing the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   A new concept in residential real estate that uses private capital
provided through nonprofit organizations for down-payment assistance
can help loan-qualified but cash-poor buyers. These programs bring
together down-payment charities, real estate professionals,
homebuilders, lending institutions, buyers and sellers. In a typical
transaction, down-payment and closing money is fronted by a
charitable fund pool.</TE>
<TE>   The down-payment gift industry now makes possible nearly 20% of
the Federal Housing Administration-insured single-family home
transactions in the United States. Without that extra boost, our
economy would be in much worse shape.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House Conference on Minority Homeownership last
month, President Bush recognized the need to help poor people
overcome the down-payment "hurdle" and endorsed an American Dream
Down Payment Fund. The proposed $200-million program would allow
qualified low- and moderate- income applicants to use federal grants
to cover down payments or closing costs.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal to establish the fund comes after the Federal Reserve
Bank in Minneapolis recommended that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the
private mortgage investment companies chartered by Congress,
reallocate mortgage-interest subsidies commonly provided to
low-to-moderate-income borrowers and use some of the money for
down-payment assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The program is a way for the government to jump into the effort to
drive up homeownership in this new pool of buyers. But the $200
million a year that the administration has pledged for down-payment
aid won't be enough to accomplish the president's goal of lifting 5.5
million minority families into homeownership by decade's end.</TE>
<TE>   Using private capital, the nonprofit down-payment gift industry
now makes possible about 17,000 home transactions a month for low-
and moderate-income buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming an average down-payment grant of $5,000 through the new
Bush program, no more than an additional 3,300 homes a month would be
sold. That is not nearly enough. To achieve the administration's
goal, the government should work with the existing private capital
sources. As the president has said, government cannot do it alone.</TE>
<TE>   The new federal down-payment assistance policy and the successful
ongoing work of the nonprofit down-payment gift industry are focused
on the same goal. This may turn out to be one of the most successful
public-private partnerships in the history of residential real
estate.</TE>

<HD>Free Speech? They're All Chalk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Norah Vincent</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a writer in Yardley, Pa.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attention must be paid. And it will be, if the chalkers have anything
to say about it.</LD>
<LD>   That's the message coming from college and university campuses
across the country these days, where a controversial form of
political protest is stirring up a rumpus.</LD>
<LD>   The practice, in which students use colored chalk to scrawl often
deliberately lewd -- though purportedly consciousness-raising --
slogans and drawings on campus walkways, came under fire at Wesleyan
University last month.</LD>
<TE>   College President Douglas J. Bennet, who previously had tolerated
fairly racy scribble on his sidewalks, declared a moratorium on
chalking after he saw pornographic references to specific faculty
members.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, many students and professors have protested the ban,
while others have applauded it as long overdue.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, similar debates have arisen on other
campuses, including USC, UC Berkeley, Swarthmore and Williams, but
most administrators haven't forbidden the practice. They should.</TE>
<TE>   Chalkers defend their pranks by invoking their right to free
expression.</TE>
<TE>   This is a bogus claim, primarily because chalking doesn't
necessarily qualify as protected speech but also because even if it
did, chalkers couldn't defend it as such for the simple reason that
they don't really believe in free speech.</TE>
<TE>   An argument made recently in a chalking case in Santa Cruz may
help explain why chalking isn't always protected speech. City Atty.
John G. Barisone argued that police did not violate a homeless
woman's right to free speech when they arrested her for chalking a
sidewalk. According to California case law, he said, regulating
speech in public venues doesn't violate the 1st Amendment if the
restriction is based on the method of expression rather than the
content and if alternative methods of expression are available.</TE>
<TE>   In the Santa Cruz case, both conditions were satisfied, and the
woman was convicted of defacing public property.</TE>
<TE>   Apply this reasonable standard to campus chalkings and 1st
Amendment objections likewise disappear.</TE>
<TE>   The content of what is being expressed needn't be an issue;
sensible objections to campus chalking can be made on purely
aesthetic grounds. Chalking is graffiti, it's ugly, and it should be
illegal on campus for the same reason that it's illegal in most other
places. It diminishes quality of life, and if everyone did it,
college idylls would become as squalid as subway tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, alternative methods of expression are available on
campus. Students can publish their views in college newspapers. They
can print pamphlets and hand them out at student unions or even on
campus walkways. They need not deface college property.</TE>
<TE>   By this reasonable definition, chalking isn't really protected
speech at all.</TE>
<TE>   But for argument's sake, let's say that the California standard is
hogwash and that chalking should enjoy 1st Amendment protection.</TE>
<TE>   If students want to make this case, they're going to have to
accept one particularly inconvenient truth about free expression. It
applies to everyone, not just your friends and co-conspirators.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, though, chalkers don't see it this way.</TE>
<TE>   The same students who shriek loudest in defense of their right to
deface sidewalks with intentionally offensive "speech" are usually
those who campaign hardest for enforcing draconian politically
correct "hate speech" codes.</TE>
<TE>   They're also often the same people who pilfer entire print runs of
conservative campus newspapers when those papers run objectionable
commentaries.</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly civil libertarians, are they? Nope, just the usual
wilding packs of self-entitled, sophomoric pranksters falling back on
high principles when it suits them.</TE>
<TE>   It's time they get the spanking they deserve or start living up to
what free speech really means.</TE>

<HD>Plan Past 'the Day After'</HD>
<DH>U.S. must look beyond a terrorist nuclear attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brett Wagner</AU>
<BD>Brett Wagner is president of the California Center for
Strategic Studies, executive director of the Swords Into Plowshares
Project and a professor at the U.S. Naval War College. The opinions
expressed are his own.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We awoke recently to a new FBI alert telling Americans that Al Qaeda
may be planning a "spectacular" terrorist attack intended to damage
the U.S. economy and inflict large-scale casualties.</LD>
<LD>   The unusually dire warning suggested that future Al Qaeda attacks
would meet several criteria, including "high symbolic value, mass
casualties, severe damage to the U.S. economy and maximum
psychological trauma." It sounds eerily like a description of a
nuclear weapon being detonated on U.S. soil.</LD>
<LD>   Though many Americans are finally taking seriously the very real
possibility that a terrorist organization could one day acquire a
nuclear weapon and detonate it in the United States, few have
considered all the possible long-term consequences -- nor has the
Bush administration's new national security strategy.</LD>
<TE>   This lack of foresight and preparedness not only leaves the
country vulnerable to many horrific aftermath scenarios should the
unthinkable happen, it could also have devastating effects on
American foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans now know that Russia's nuclear stockpiles are
under-secured, with hundreds of tons of weapon-grade uranium and
plutonium scattered across that country. A few pounds of either
material could arm a nuclear device capable of leveling almost any
U.S. city. Also widely known is that terrorist organizations have
tried to acquire stolen or diverted nuclear materials and warheads.</TE>
<TE>   Should an organization such as Al Qaeda acquire a nuclear device,
there is little reason to believe that it could be kept out of this
country.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, most of the discussion and research in this area
has focused solely on "the day before" or "the day after" such a
terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   The really scary stuff, however, lies just beyond that: the day
after the day after.</TE>
<TE>   A terrorist group would not even actually need to possess a second
device; it would merely just have to say it did. It could claim it
had several more hidden in other U.S. cities, ready to be used if the
U.S. military did not start withdrawing from the Arabian peninsula --
a key Al Qaeda objective -- in, say, 72 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine what the outbound highways would look like near any U.S.
city or the overall effect on our economy, our security, our civil
rights, our way of life, our ability to project military power
throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   Could U.S. leaders not comply with the terrorists' demands,
knowing the possible consequences in human and political terms? What
would happen to all those U.S. military bases in the Middle East?
What would become of Persian Gulf oil and the Western economies that
are so dependent upon it?</TE>
<TE>   The implications for the Navy alone are staggering. How far would
the Navy's forces have to pull back from the Middle East?</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's recently released National Security Strategy
virtually ignores these considerations. Key concerns deserving his
immediate attention include how to calm the nation in the event of
nuclear blackmail or surprise attack, how to open and conduct
negotiations with nuclear-armed terrorists and how to govern a nation
truly under siege, preferably without sacrificing civil liberties or
resorting to martial law.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the administration should begin developing
contingency plans for "the day after the day after" to stabilize
stock and financial markets, guarantee the basic functioning of the
economy, relocate large numbers of potentially hysterical American
citizens fleeing radioactive fallout, redeploy U.S. forces abroad
rapidly should that prove necessary and, last but not least, provide
medical and personal care for the wounded and dying.</TE>
<TE>   The president should also work closely with the new Congress to
redouble U.S. efforts to help fully secure Russia's enormous nuclear
stockpiles before they begin slipping into terrorist hands. That is,
after all, one of the best ways to help ensure that a nuclear 9/11
never happens.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, should the Bush administration continue to ignore these
considerations, Americans may wake up one morning to the aftermath of
a terrorist nuclear attack, an FBI alert warning that more attacks
may be imminent and a White House without a plan for what to do next.</TE>

<HD>The Gang-Bratton Face-Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Supermodel Cindy Crawford chatted up super-cop Bill Bratton last week
at a billionaire bash at 20th Century Fox. While Los Angeles' elites
feted the new police chief, so did the city's criminals. Since Friday
night, they have dropped 16 bodies on the welcome mat, raising Los
Angeles' annual homicide rate to levels not seen in six years.</LD>
<LD>   And that's not counting five LAPD shootings: Two men died from
gunfire and two juveniles were killed in a car crash after officers
fired at their vehicle. Each of these officer- involved shootings may
well turn out to be justified, but lest Bratton underestimate the
strength of the rogue subculture he is up against within the LAPD,
the Department of Justice left its calling card. It has opened a
civil rights investigation into 3-year-old charges that officers on
an alleged vigilante mission tracked down and beat a young man who
had thrown a beer can at an off-duty cop's car.</LD>
<LD>   In urging cops to get out of their cars and go after criminals,
the new chief needs to make sure that officers also heed the rest of
his message, which is to attack crime in a way that's constitutional.</LD>
<TE>   Even before Bratton arrived, some forward-thinking LAPD officers
were working quietly to transform the department's cowboy mentality.
One example: Then-Cmdr. George Gascon taught a leadership course on
how to keep a situation -- whether responding to a tossed beer can,
answering a noise complaint at a Halloween party or confronting a
screwdriver-wielding homeless woman -- from escalating. That's a
lesson that needs to be taught to new recruits and reinforced, from
the chief down, and it's encouraging that Bratton has elevated Gascon
to be one of his top deputies.</TE>
<TE>   The infamously understaffed LAPD has long projected a macho image
to make up for what it lacks in manpower. When Bratton was asked by
the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce what size the force should be, he
said 12,000 minimum -- 3,000 officers more than now. He's right; even
at 12,000 the LAPD would be among the lowest of large U.S. police
forces in terms of officer-to-citizen ratio. He also knows that he'll
have to build the public's will to pay for new officers; there is no
money now.</TE>
<TE>   All this means that to end the chokehold that criminal street
gangs have on too many of the city's neighborhoods, Bratton is going
to have to substitute brains for what the force lacks in brawn. He is
smart to say he intends to put together an interagency approach that
combines county, state, federal and community resources. To that list
of resources he would be wise to add input from the state's prisons,
where gang leaders call the shots inside and out.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton knew what he was getting into when he sought this job, but
that doesn't make the numbers from the last week any less sobering.
Already the former top cop in Boston and New York City has pronounced
Los Angeles' gang, graffiti and homeless problems the worst he's seen
and its ratio of police officers to population the lowest. Bratton
can have all the caviar he wants as long as he maintains an even
greater taste for the challenge ahead of him.</TE>

<HD>When Distant Holes Collide</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here we were contemplating a dispute around the old oak tree, a
thorough holiday rug-cleaning and which turkey stuffing to use next
week when suddenly our lives collided with news of these two
colliding black holes in space.</LD>
<LD>   You might have missed it because the discovery of evidence
pointing to the colossal crash of two galaxies was widely deemed less
newsworthy on Earth than the Bachelor's final pick or the possible
demolition of Los Angeles police headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   So let's think of this celestial story in terms familiar to the
California universe -- say, as a freeway. We (our sun and its
planets) are on the southbound side of the freeway. Earth is in the
southbound commuter lane moving at 66,500 miles an hour, which would
make for a short commute if Earth had a destination in the infinity
of space.</LD>
<TE>   On the freeway's northbound side are two trucks, each the size of
the Milky Way. Interestingly, one of them is going the wrong way.
They collide. Whatever is in them, along with whatever is in the
neighborhood, flies into a lot of large pieces, emitting forces we've
yet to contemplate and radiation requiring sun block with an SPF
around 5,000. All this would spill into the southbound lanes for
millions of years. Now, do you find this worthy of the traffic
report?</TE>
<TE>   It's true, space news seems far away, even if Lance Bass gets
there. If we ignore space, maybe it too will go away. Space can be
bewildering. It has hypotheses, hypotenuses and nuclei, invisible
rays, black holes that aren't holes and more baffling numbers than
even your car lease. For example, these colliding galaxies are 400
million light-years away, which, at 186,000 miles a second, is 2,400
million trillion miles away, give or take a lane.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the two galaxies has a black hole, and the mass in each
black hole generates gravity stronger than any Oreck. Light can't
even escape from black holes; hence, the name. Talk about stuffing.</TE>
<TE>   The galaxies circle each other, faster and faster like water down
a drain. They're at 3,000 light-years and closing. The total merger
will take many millions of years. (By the way, our galaxy is headed
straight toward the Andromeda galaxy.)</TE>
<TE>   But wait a thousand seconds! The light we're seeing now started
its journey to the new Chandra space telescope 400 million years ago.
So the explosive merger probably already happened. Was anyone's
weekend spoiled? Was "Harry Potter's" box office hurt? It's old news.
Who cares?</TE>
<TE>   Let's get back to important stuff. So at 20 minutes a pound and
325 degrees, a 16-pound turkey should cook for -- um, drop the zero,
carry the one -- well, way less than a light-year anyway.</TE>

<LD>Nothing can prevent every maritime disaster, and even the
"unsinkable" Titanic wasn't. But the sinking of a tanker filled with
20 million gallons of oil off the coast of Spain this week and the
potential environmental catastrophe that is unfolding as a result
could have and should have been prevented.</LD>
<LD>   The Prestige was a type of single-hull tanker mass-produced by
Japan more than a quarter-century ago. No one should be surprised
that it cracked open during a storm, nor should anyone be shocked
when the next of the many tankers of its kind churning the oceans
cracks open.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of pre-1980 Japanese-built oil tankers remain in
operation. Single-hull tankers are said to make up about half of the
world's 10,000-ship fleet of oil carriers.</LD>
<TE>   The Erika, another single-hull tanker of the same technically
unsophisticated generation, sank off the coast of Brittany in 1999.
The Braer sank in 1993, and the Aegean Sea sank the year before.</TE>
<TE>   The frequency of these disasters should produce international
outrage and pressure for stricter rules intended to phase out
single-hull tankers.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody says double-hull tankers are perfectly safe, but at least
they make oil spills less common and less disastrous. So could
regulations to speed up the mothballing of old ships, which begin to
wear out and become dangerous after about 20 years. Yet, the
Prestige, which was loaded in Latvia and bound for Singapore, was
cleared to sail until 2005, when it would have been almost 30 years
old.</TE>
<TE>   If the sunken Prestige releases its entire cargo into the water,
the incident will rank 14th among tanker spills. But it won't be easy
to establish responsibility for the damage.</TE>
<TE>   Like many ships today, the vessel is covered by a corporate veil
that makes it hard for authorities to nail down who is to pay for
damages. The Prestige was owned by a Liberian-registered firm,
registered in the Bahamas by a Greek management firm, chartered by a
Swiss-based Russian oil trader and classed as seaworthy by the
American Bureau of Shipping.</TE>
<TE>   The Prestige sank a dozen miles from the Galician Bank, an area
rich with coral, sponges, fish and other kinds of marine life. Once
the cleanup is done, the United Nations International Maritime
Organization should designate the Galician Bank a "particularly
sensitive sea area." That would restrict shipping traffic and protect
this environmentally spectacular place from even shipwrecks that are
unavoidable.</TE>

<LD>The passage Tuesday of the Bush administration's bill to create the
Department of Homeland Security may well signal the beginning of the
end of our constitutional democracy. Embedded in this bill is the
most far-reaching assault on privacy and civil liberties that has
ever taken place in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   It lays the groundwork for a department euphemistically called
"Information Awareness" to have the authority to spy on Americans. No
shred of personal information will be private.</LD>
<LD>   As horrific as the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 were, they did
not threaten the constitutional foundations of our government. It is
the Bush administration's response to Sept. 11 that threatens the
rights of all Americans and, by extension, the geopolitical stability
of the planet. We have seen this president repeatedly using Sept. 11
and "national security" to weaken civil liberties and drum up support
for a needless war while our economy declined, unemployment increased
and too many Americans suffered from hunger and lack of medical
insurance. The passage of this bill should make it clear that the
administration's agenda is to remake our democracy into a police
state. All to protect national security, of course.</LD>

<TE>   Will somebody assist me? The ex-CEO guys who now run our
government, preach small government and rant that throwing money at a
problem is no way to solve it have just created the largest
government boondoggle in our history called "homeland security" and
added to a growing Defense Department. The combined boondoggles will
approximate a trillion dollars annually of taxpayer money and debt.
This was done to "defend" us from a small number of guys in a cave
who orchestrated the destruction of the World Trade Center and who
continue to terrorize us by operating with a budget of perhaps $40
million annually.</TE>

<LD>Re "Glacier Park on Thin Ice," Nov. 18: So the glaciers in Glacier
National Park will be history within 30 years. It boggles the mind.
How can the Bush administration arrogantly strip away so many
hard-won environmental protections when "most scientists agree the
recent warming is mainly a product of industrial activity." Surely it
must filter up to President Bush, Interior Secretary Gale Norton,
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christine Todd Whitman
and Vice President Dick Cheney that global warming is endangering
humanity.</LD>
<LD>   Between reading in last week's Times the pope's exhortations to
his flock to exponentially increase breeding (Nov. 15) and this
administration's emphasis on frantically developing ever more
oilfields and coal mines to the serious detriment of the environment,
one has to wonder how long life itself can be sustained on planet
Earth.</LD>

<TE>   Your article illustrated the shocking reality of climate change.
While much of the debate in the U.S. continues to center on whether
climate change is indeed happening, much less attention is given to
potential solutions. As a society we simply must begin a transition
away from dependence on the fossil fuels that cause global warming.
While the rapid onset of glacial melting is distressing, the
activities of college students around the state of California this
past fall have been inspirational. Students on every UC campus have
formed a coalition to support investment in clean-energy solutions
like wind and solar for their campuses. Their passion and willingness
to act may yet lead us away from ecological disaster.</TE>

<LD>Re "Errant Cell Calls Are Clogging 911 System," Nov. 17: I have a
suggestion. Why not bill all these offenders $50 a call? I mean for
all calls, not just cell phone users. This will make many individuals
more careful and send a strong message to those like the woman
concerned with her dog's haircut. We can set up a system with the
phone companies to do the billing. An ad campaign will fall like a
rock on those like the woman with the dog. If the cost of the errant
phone calls does not deter these people, the additional funds will
help the system to better cope.</LD>

sovereign country with its own people, territory, democratically

since its founding over 50 years ago, has not ruled Taiwan even for a

<LD>Re " 'Tough on Crime' May Backfire," by Jonathan Miller, Commentary,
Nov. 17: A murder is committed in California and the murderer, a U.S.
citizen, flees to Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Once across the border, the Mexican legal system shields the
murderer from punishment by refusing to return the fugitive to
California unless the lenient Mexican law for punishment of the
murder is followed.</LD>
<LD>   Only a law school professor such as Miller could argue from these
facts that California is responsible for the murderer remaining free
by refusing to acquiesce to the demands of Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   California is legally, morally and ethically correct in insisting
that U.S. citizens who kill others in California be judged and
punished by California law. It is Mexico that has violated the
sovereignty of another by demanding it dictate the sentence for U.S.
citizens who commit murder in the United States. Mexico is free to
embrace murderers from another country, but neither Mexico nor its
apologists should be allowed to clothe such actions as being the
rightful or moral exercise of sovereignty.</TE>

<LD>Re "Replay of Reagan-Era Voting Patterns Is Not Good News for
Democrats," Nov. 18: In his column cataloging the woes of the
Democrats, Ronald Brownstein glosses over the main reason they lost
so many races. It's the same one as always -- voter apathy. Do the
math: If a combined total of roughly 91,000 Democrats who did not
vote had voted in three states (Missouri, Minnesota and New
Hampshire), those states would have sent Democrats to the Senate, the
party would have a solid majority and it would be President Bush,
Karl Rove and Marc Racicot feeling the heat.</LD>
<LD>   Until the Democrats make it Job One to get their core voters down
to the polls on election day, they will remain a majority party that
consistently loses, and the GOP will continue to spin its nonexistent
"mandate" into something approaching a fact.</LD>

<TE>   Your article on the presumed low support for Gore almost got it
right, except for the minor detail that you polled the only people
who don't count. Yes, we need change within the Democratic Party. And
those nameless, faceless operatives in the party hierarchy whom you
talked with are the ones who need to go. Meanwhile, Gore, our
popularly elected president, is the overwhelming choice of voters in
national polls. Pardon me for thinking the electorate's voice should
carry more weight than that of those clueless DNC people in their
ivory towers.</TE>

<TE>   Reproductive rights, gun control laws and our environment are just
some of the things that are poised to be attacked by the Republicans
in control. It is especially crucial at this time for the Democratic
leadership to make our positions heard loud and clear. If Democrats
are to recapture the White House and Congress, it will be won through
the issues -- give the people a reason to vote for Democrats.</TE>

<HD>Airport Issue Lures Burbank Officials to Glendale Meeting</HD>
<DH>Councilman and vice mayor go before neighboring council to
decry a decision to give up on moving terminal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burbank Airport officials had just completed a presentation to the
Glendale City Council on their decision to scrap a decades-old plan
to move the airport's passenger terminal when they were followed at
the podium by two surprise guests.</LD>
<LD>   Burbank City Councilman Dave Golonski and Vice Mayor Stacey
Murphy, both of whom slipped out of their own council meeting minutes
earlier, took turns at the podium blasting the
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority for its "irresponsible
decision."</LD>
<LD>   They also criticized the authority for trying to sell or lease the
land designated for the replacement terminal. They asked the Glendale
council for help in resurrecting the relocation plan, which they hope
would ultimately reduce noise for the airport's neighbors.</LD>
<TE>   The visit by Golonski and Murphy stunned and angered airport
authority officials, who had just finished explaining their reasons
for abandoning the terminal relocation plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We were scheduled to give our presentation," authority President
Chris Holden said. "They decided to hijack it."</TE>
<TE>   Holden and other airport officials said that continuing the fight
for a replacement terminal would be futile because of Burbank's
hostile political climate. The authority voted 5 to 4 earlier this
month to drop its plans for similar reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "We're tired of banging our heads against the wall," Holden said.</TE>
<TE>   The only way the authority would resume efforts to relocate the
terminal would be if the Federal Aviation Administration forced it to
do so for safety reasons, Holden said. Portions of the current
terminal, built more than 70 years ago, are 350 feet closer to the
runway than what is permitted by modern airport construction
standards.</TE>
<TE>   But Burbank Airport officials contend that the terminal is safe
and have asked the FAA to render an opinion to help resolve the
issue. An FAA spokesman said the agency might have an answer by the
end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Like Burbank and Pasadena, Glendale cannot veto the airport
authority's decision but has the power to appoint or fire
commissioners. Two of Glendale's three commissioners voted in favor
of dropping future terminal relocation efforts. Burbank's three
representatives voted against it.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Burbank officials said they want to be sure the
Glendale City Council hears their concerns regarding the airport
authority's action. They said they would prefer that local officials
resolve the issue, rather than the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank officials believe that the FAA would be more likely to
permit nighttime flight curfews if a new and safer terminal were
built. Local residents have long demanded curfews as a way to reduce
airport noise.</TE>
<TE>   But airport officials are not convinced that a new terminal would
affect a federal decision over flight curfews. The airport authority
is continuing a $4.2-million study, required by federal law, that is
analyzing the benefits and costs of flight restrictions, Holden said.</TE>
<TE>   The study must be completed before flight curfews can be
considered, federal officials said.</TE>
<TE>   After speaking before the Glendale council, Golonski and Murphy
returned to the Burbank council meeting, where they informed their
colleagues and constituents about their actions.</TE>
<TE>   But not all Burbank residents appreciated their lobbying efforts
for a new passenger terminal, which some fear would only lead to
airport expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "Who are they speaking for?" said David Piroli, who attended the
council's meeting. "We don't want a new terminal."</TE>
<TE>   Fellow resident Dan Elsmore said the airport authority was smart
to recognize the intense public opposition to moving the terminal.</TE>
<TE>   "Why the city thinks it will be a bargaining chip [for curfews] is
a mystery," he said. "That's not the way the FAA works."</TE>

<HD>Alexandre de Merode, 68; Prince Led Olympics' Anti-Drug
Effort</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prince Alexandre de Merode of Belgium, who for more than three
decades served as the International Olympic Committee's point man in
a "war" on athletes' use of performance-enhancing drugs, has died. He
was 68.</LD>
<LD>   De Merode died Tuesday night in a Brussels hospital. The cause of
death was not announced. He was known to have lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   De Merode had been an IOC member since 1964; only two current IOC
members have served longer. His hereditary title of "prince" has been
passed down for generations in his family; he was not a member of
Belgium's royal family.</LD>
<TE>   IOC President Jacques Rogge, a fellow Belgian, issued a statement
that called De Merode "a fervent defender of Olympic values
throughout his life." Juan Antonio Samaranch, who headed the IOC from
1980 to 2001, said that during his presidency De Merode was "the
first and the most important fighter against doping."</TE>
<TE>   De Merode served on the IOC's policymaking executive board from
1980 to 1990. He was an IOC vice president twice, in 1986-90 and
1994-98.</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1934 in Etterbek, Belgium, De Merode was conversant in
English but preferred to speak French. He was not a doctor but for 35
years he served as chairman of the IOC's medical commission --
charged with blunting athlete use of muscle-building steroids and
other substances.</TE>
<TE>   Don Catlin, head of the UCLA lab that oversaw drug tests at the
1984 Los Angeles Olympics as well as the 2002 Salt Lake City Games,
said Wednesday that De Merode had "enormous commitment and integrity"
and "took on this issue when nobody else even thought about it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, the commission found Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson guilty
of doping after he had won the 100-meter race at the Seoul Olympics.
Johnson, who had used steroids, was stripped of his medal.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, De Merode's commission repeatedly sounded
warnings about the disturbingly high rate of asthma reported by
world-class athletes as well as athletes' expanding use of
nutritional supplements. Certain asthma inhalers contain
performance-enhancing stimulants. Some supplements have been found to
contain the steroid nandrolone and other substances banned by the
IOC.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 35 years, however, the IOC's anti-doping campaign
has often proven ineffective and De Merode had been accused by
critics of being politically ineffectual or willfully ignorant of
real life in the world's gyms, pools and weight rooms.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, on his watch the East German sports machine won
hundreds of Olympic medals. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, it was
revealed that many of those medals were won by giving steroids to
athletes, some as young as 11; the youngsters were not told what the
"little blue pills" really were. The IOC has taken no action against
German officials or athletes.</TE>
<TE>   At the close of the 1984 Summer Olympics, several test results in
De Merode's hotel suite were destroyed in an "accident." The prince
maintained that it was the fault of L.A. Games organizers who, he
said, were in a hurry to wind things up as the Olympics were ending.
Catlin said, "As far as I'm concerned, he never did anything to
scuttle or hide or obfuscate any test results."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s came record-shattering performances by Chinese female
athletes in swimming and other sports; an unusual number of Chinese
drug positives followed. Then, in 1998, a doping scandal stained the
Tour de France -- underscoring the widespread use of drugs in cycling
and other Olympic sports and leading the next year to the creation of
the World Anti-Doping Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of being vigilant and in front of the curve, experts said,
too often over the years De Merode and the IOC simply found
themselves responding to doping-related crises. "Arguably the
response was PR rather than substantive," said Charles Yesalis, a
Penn State professor and expert on doping in the Olympic movement.</TE>
<TE>   Yesalis added: "I just can't imagine anyone during the last 30, 40
years who played a leadership role in Olympic sport that didn't know
how bad doping was."</TE>
<TE>   The creation of the anti-doping agency significantly diminished De
Merode's role in the anti-drug campaign. In May 2000, he tendered his
resignation as head of the IOC medical commission. He was promptly
asked to stay, which he did, but owing to illness was absent from a
number of recent IOC meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled for Monday in Brussels.</TE>

<HD>School District, Tustin Resume Court Battle</HD>
<DH>Santa Ana Unified objects to the city's way of guaranteeing
the $60 million it agreed to pay to settle a lengthy dispute over
base land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six months after shaking hands to settle a long, bitter dispute over
land at the closed Tustin Marine base, Santa Ana Unified School
District is taking Tustin back to court, accusing city officials of
reneging on terms of a $60-million deal.</LD>
<LD>   A Superior Court judge last week issued a temporary restraining
order barring Tustin from making any planning or zoning decisions
regarding the 1,600-acre base until a hearing set for Dec. 2, an
attorney for the school district said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the May settlement agreement, Tustin cannot proceed with
plans to redevelop the former helicopter base until both parties are
satisfied that all terms have been met.</LD>
<TE>   At issue is how Tustin will guarantee the $60 million it has
agreed to pay Santa Ana Unified for settling the district's claim to
portions of the base that lie within its boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement called for Tustin to provide Santa Ana Unified with
a letter of credit, which means a bank would vouch for the city's
financial obligation to the school district, said David J.
Hesseltine, one of Santa Ana's attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The district could use that letter to secure a loan and get
immediate access to about $38 million to build schools. The
62,000-student district, one of the most crowded in the state, has
embarked on a major construction program to build several schools and
expand and upgrade many others.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin, however, is offering a promissory note and deeds of trust
on about 100 acres of base land to back it. Under the agreement,
Tustin could use a promissory note if it could not secure a letter of
credit. But school district officials allege Tustin has not made an
honest effort to obtain a letter of credit. They say it would take
the district much longer to secure loans based on deeds of trust
whose value is still uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "Tustin has reneged on what it originally agreed," said Santa Ana
school board President John Palacio, one of the chief negotiators in
the May settlement. "They need to honor their commitment."</TE>
<TE>   Tustin officials did not return calls seeking comment. But City
Manager William A. Huston said last month that obtaining a letter of
credit would cost the city too much in bank fees given current
economic jitters.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin and the Santa Ana school district have been embroiled in
the land dispute for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   When the federal government announced the closure of the Tustin
Marine base and others in the early 1990s, school districts near the
closed bases were to share in the land windfall.</TE>
<TE>   But when Santa Ana Unified and Rancho Santiago Community College
District were passed over by Tustin, which is in charge of the base's
redevelopment, they sued in 1994. They also accused Tustin of keeping
their schools out because the majority of their students are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   The college district settled in April for 15 acres at the base.
Santa Ana Unified settled soon after for $38 million in cash to be
paid over 18 months, and an option to build on a 22-acre parcel.</TE>
<TE>   When the land turned out to be too toxic for a campus unless
expensive cleanup was undertaken, the district opted last month to
take an additional $22 million in cash, which brought the total
settlement to $60 million.</TE>

<HD>Brush Fire Nears 30 Homes in O.C. Hills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane and Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fast-moving, erratic brush fire, fueled by hot, dry weather and
driven by gusty winds, was threatening as many as 30 hillside homes
in Yorba Linda late Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks like it's moving at a pretty good clip," said Dennis
Shell, a spokesman for the Orange County Fire Authority, which by 10
p.m. had more than 100 firefighters on scene, along with strike teams
from Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   One firefighter -- a woman working as part of a reserve crew
cutting brush by hand on a hillside -- had to be airlifted to a
hospital for treatment of "medical complications, possibly
overexertion or dehydration," said Capt. Steve Miller of the fire
authority. Her condition was stable, he said.</LD>
<TE>   According to Shell, the fire started about 7:30 p.m. on Yorba
Linda's Blue Gum Drive near Chino Hills State Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got fire investigators on scene right now [to determine the
cause]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fanned by gusty winds of 25 to 35 mph and fueled by temperatures
of more than 80 degrees, the fire spread quickly west through about
50 acres of waist-high brush and "flashy, grassy fuels," Shell said.</TE>
<TE>   Though moving generally away from populated areas, the 25- to
30-foot flames at times came to within a few hundred yards of some
homes as the wind shifted.</TE>
<TE>   "With these gusty winds it's very erratic and unpredictable,"
Shell said. By 10 p.m., the fire was about 40% contained.</TE>
<TE>   "If the winds give us a break I think we're OK," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making some good headway -- it's starting to look like
[conditions] are becoming favorable."</TE>
<TE>   He said dozens of firefighters were deployed in residential areas
with hoses at the ready. "They're talking to residents, keeping them
calm and prepared to immediately put down any flare-ups," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts were aided, Shell said, by the residents, who seemed
well-prepared for the annual fire season, which has been prolonged
this year by drought-like conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "The community has done an excellent job of brush clearance and
has some excellent greenbelts around their homes," he said. "From
what we can see, there are many noncombustible roofs in the area,
which is a good help."</TE>
<TE>   Some power lines were reported down, Shell said, possibly causing
interruptions in service.</TE>

<HD>Evidence Seized in Fourth of July Killing</HD>
<DH>Acting on a tip, Buena Park police search a home and
confiscate ammunition similar to the bullet that killed a 9-year-old
boy in park.</DH>

<LD>Since July 4, Priscilla Borjon, 13, takes weekly walks with her
grandmother to Boisseranc Park in Buena Park to place flowers next to
a concrete sign that has become a makeshift memorial.</LD>
<LD>   She tends the flowers left for her 9-year-old cousin, Xavier
Morales, by students, teachers and strangers. And she prays to find
his killer.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been hard for us," Priscilla said. "I miss him. Grandma
cries a lot. We're heartbroken."</LD>
<TE>   Xavier, who had just finished fourth grade at Sunkist Elementary
School, was killed by a bullet fired into the air during Fourth of
July celebrations at the park, police said. The bullet pierced his
lungs and severed the aorta before it exited his hip.</TE>
<TE>   Though the case remains unsolved, police said Wednesday that they
are getting closer to giving the Morales family answers.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said a caller has led them to a possible suspect who
lives nearby, but they declined to release information about the man.
Police have searched his home, where they said they seized bullets
similar to those used in the shooting. The FBI is conducting
ballistics tests, which could take up to 30 days, to determine if
there is a match.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, officials said that several groups, including
Xavier's mother's employer, have raised the reward in the case to
$25,000.</TE>
<TE>   "This case needs to come together for Xavier," said Buena Park
Police Chief Gary Hicken. "We had a chaotic scene with everyone
shooting fireworks ... but I think someone might have remembered
something."</TE>
<TE>   The Anaheim boy had attended a fireworks show at the park with his
older brother, Arturo, and several other relatives. He said he wasn't
feeling well and walked to the park's entrance, where he collapsed.
Arturo called police after he helped his brother up and discovered
blood gushing from his side.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the shot could have been fired from as far away as a
mile. They declined to state from which direction it was fired. In
investigating Xavier's death, authorities also discovered that four
parked cars near the fireworks show were hit with bullets.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes it really hard is who did it and why," said Xavier's
mother, Vickie Morales, holding her son's school picture taken weeks
before his death. "The police have investigated and followed all
leads," she said, choking back tears. "So far, we feel in the dark.
If anyone knows anything, we beg for them to come forward. This is
the worst thing that can happen to anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Police are urging anyone who videotaped any portion of the Fourth
of July proceedings at the park to let authorities view their tapes.</TE>

<HD>Republican Party Digs for Signs of Hope as It Reflects on
Election Fiasco</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>Sacramento</DL>
<LD>Sacramento</LD>
<LD>   A story Ronald Reagan loved to tell fits perfectly what
Republicans are going through in California.</LD>
<LD>   Reagan favored the story because it was about optimism, his
lifeblood. Credit Garry South, Gov. Gray Davis' political guru, with
recalling the tale during election postmortems.</LD>
<TE>   Briefly, the Great Communicator would tell of a boy who found a
room full of horse manure and happily began digging through it. Why?
Because, the boy replied, "with this much manure around, I know
there's a pony in here someplace."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans now are anxiously looking for the pony in their
California election debacle. While the GOP triumphed across much of
America, it lost every statewide race here for the first time in 120
years.</TE>
<TE>   It blew a chance to oust an unpopular Democratic governor.
Republican Bill Simon Jr. lost to Davis by only five percentage
points.</TE>
<TE>   "Simon ran a dismal, awful campaign," notes Tony Quinn, a veteran
political analyst and former GOP advisor. "He had to really work at
losing it. The real crime of his campaign was to depress the turnout
of people who would have voted Republican."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Democrats also wound up controlling both legislative
houses by big margins. They hold both U.S. Senate seats and will
again dominate California's congressional delegation, 33 to 20.</TE>
<TE>   South has used the manure story to belittle the Republicans'
digging through election results in search of hope for the future.
The fact is, he says, the GOP has no bench of reserves capable of
someday running for high office.</TE>
<TE>   But in all those GOP losses, there indeed is a pony or two. And
South concedes it.</TE>
<TE>   The election was not a total loss for Republicans. They picked up
legislative seats: at least two in the Assembly -- a third still is
undecided -- and apparently one in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Mainly, however, the election ended -- or should have ended -- a
four-year debate about whether California was becoming another
Hawaii: a state that, because of growing Latino and labor clout, is
perpetually Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   (Actually, as it turns out, even Hawaii is no longer a Hawaii. It
just elected a Republican governor, its first in 40 years.)</TE>
<TE>   California is still a moderate, swing-vote state -- as it has been
throughout history -- that can lean left or right depending on the
issues and candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "Democrats are kidding themselves if they think California
automatically is locked in forever for them," South says. "We have a
lock right now, but that's not a permanent condition.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is that the Democratic Legislature will push people
too far where they don't want to go, and there'll be a backlash."</TE>
<TE>   Harry Pachon, president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute and a
Claremont Graduate University professor, also says Democrats don't
have a lock on California in the 2004 presidential election. Al Gore
carried the state by 12 points in 2000. But Pachon says President
Bush "has the potential for drawing away Hispanic voters.</TE>
<TE>   "First-generation immigrants are not wedded to either party that
strongly.... Candidates matter."</TE>
<TE>   Latino turnout on election day was down -- from 13% of the
electorate in 1998 to 10% in the Davis-Simon mud-wrestle -- according
to The Times Poll.</TE>
<TE>   Because only 50% of registered voters cast ballots, an all-time
low, this election revealed the core support of each party. Statewide
Republican candidates all got between 40% and 45%, averaging 42%.
That's the GOP core vote. Democrats got between 45% and 51%,
averaging 48%. That's their base.</TE>
<TE>   Most voters probably were party-ticket people. Conversely, most
stay-at-homes, who couldn't stomach either gubernatorial candidate,
ordinarily would have been ticket-splitting swing voters.</TE>
<TE>   So how can Republicans build on their base? They're alive in
California, but badly need rehab.</TE>
<TE>   The state party must professionalize. Move its headquarters to
Sacramento. Strengthen county organizations. Cease its incessant
civil warfare.</TE>
<TE>   More important, it needs moderate, socially tolerant candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1988, no top-of-the-ticket candidate has won in California
who didn't support abortion rights. "Pro-life" moralists scare many
women. So do pro-gun zealots and environmental despoilers. Until
Republicans acknowledge this, they won't win much of anything.</TE>
<TE>   Women preferred Davis by 15 points, The Times exit poll found.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP should recruit more women and minority candidates. Both
seats picked up in the Assembly were by women; one also was a Latina.</TE>
<TE>   "Republican leadership and candidates don't reflect the diversity
of California," laments Cristi Cristich, an Anaheim manufacturer and
GOP fund-raising activist.</TE>
<TE>   "Surely there are lots of articulate and qualified women out
there."</TE>
<TE>   As Reagan would say, keep digging.</TE>

<HD>Forced Return of Kids Blocked</HD>
<DH>Court rules Mexican father cannot compel ex-wife to bring
children back from San Diego.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A battered woman granted child custody in a Mexican divorce can't be
forced to return the children from San Diego, even though she
promised not to take them from Mexico without the father's consent, a
federal appellate court ruled Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The case, decided by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, is
likely to spur further debate on global child-custody disputes.
Judges in Britain ruled the other way in a comparable case.</LD>
<LD>   The decision has major ramifications "for victims of domestic
violence who are crossing international borders fleeing" such
violence with their children, said San Diego attorney Tulin D.
Acikalin, one of the mother's lawyers.</LD>
<TE>   But Victor Mordey, the Chula Vista lawyer who represents the
father, said he has a valid order from a San Diego County Superior
Court crediting the Mexican court order. Consequently, Mordey said,
the father is still entitled to take his children back to Mexico
under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act.</TE>
<TE>   The mother, Rosa Teresa Gutierrez, fled Mexico with her children
after her husband allegedly abused her physically, according to the
opinion. Under a 2000 divorce from a Jalisco, Mexico, family court,
her husband, Eduardo Arce Gonzalez, got visitation rights. Gutierrez,
who was awarded physical custody, agreed not to take the two children
from Mexico without Arce's consent.</TE>
<TE>   But when the abuse continued, the mother, without telling Arce,
took the children to San Diego, according to the opinion. Arce filed
a lawsuit there seeking the return of the children.</TE>
<TE>   He cited The Hague Convention, a 1986 treaty signed by 51
countries, including the United States and Mexico. It is designed to
secure the return of children wrongfully taken by a parent from one
country to another, often in hope of obtaining a more favorable
custody decision in the second country.</TE>
<TE>   The key legal issue was whether the husband's visitation rights
amounted to custody rights under the treaty, said 9th Circuit Judge
Stephen Reinhardt in his 24-page ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The Convention clearly gives primacy to a parent who has custody,
as opposed to a parent who has been granted visitation rights,
according to the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore the clause in the divorce limiting movement of the
children "does not transform Arce's visitation rights into custodial
rights under the Convention," Reinhardt wrote. Judges A. Wallace
Tashima and Stephen S. Trott joined in the opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "The drafters of The Hague Convention decided that only custodial
parents" had the right to gain forceful return of their children from
another country, said Gutierrez's co-counsel, Rose M. Kasusky of Casa
Cornelia, a nonprofit organization that represents immigrants and
battered women in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The trial judge, U.S. District Judge M. James Lorenz, earlier
concluded that the children had been wrongfully removed in violation
of Arce's custody under the Convention, and that Gutierrez had failed
to establish any affirmative defenses that would prevent their
return.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenz ordered that the children be returned but stayed his order
pending appeal, acknowledging that the exact nature of Arce's rights
posed "a difficult legal question that neither the 9th Circuit or the
U.S. Supreme Court has ruled upon."</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, Gutierrez applied for and was granted political
asylum in the United States. However, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service has challenged the decision, which is pending
before the Board of Immigration Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, San Diego County Superior Court Steven R. Denton
issued a ruling in May recognizing the Mexican divorce decree, which
says that the children cannot be removed from Mexico. Mordey, the
father's attorney, said he believes that the father has the right to
take the children back to Mexico.</TE>

<HD>Race for Supervisor May Hang on the Mail</HD>
<DH>County must receive Tom Coad's new voter registration form
for him to be a candidate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The future makeup of the Board of Supervisors remained in doubt
Wednesday as officials awaited the delivery of a sheet of paper that
could affect who becomes the next supervisor.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Coad, husband of board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, said he put
a voter registration form in the mail Sunday reflecting a new
northern Tustin address, which would allow him to run in a
winner-take-all election next year for an open seat in District 3.</LD>
<LD>   The seat was abruptly vacated Tuesday by Todd Spitzer, who
resigned rather than wait until Dec. 2, when he'll be sworn in as the
county's newest member to the state Assembly.</LD>
<TE>   By leaving early, Spitzer moved up the date of the election to
replace him -- and the 30-day residency requirement for candidates.
Election officials said Tom Coad's new registration would need to
have been received by Saturday to qualify him. As of late Wednesday,
they hadn't seen it.</TE>
<TE>   County Counsel Ben de Mayo, at the Coads' request, was researching
whether the law applies to the date of receipt or to the postmark.
"We need to see the postmark," he said. "It's still an open
question."</TE>
<TE>   Given the uncertainty of the situation, few of those involved
talked about it Wednesday. Neither Spitzer nor the Coads returned
phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the county's Republican establishment has backed 71st
District Assemblyman Bill Campbell -- Spitzer's predecessor -- for
the nonpartisan job. Spitzer's early exit helps Campbell by possibly
eliminating Coad as a challenger in an election that also includes
Orange Councilman Mike Alvarez, said one political observer.</TE>
<TE>   "[Spitzer] obviously wants Bill Campbell to win the election,"
said Chapman University political science professor Fred Smoller.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer hasn't officially endorsed anyone.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a question of Tom Coad's new address.</TE>
<TE>   The couple have lived for decades in western Anaheim but are
building a new house in northern Tustin. The home isn't ready to live
in, so Tom Coad rented a neighbor's guest house.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a question of when the election will be held. Under a
new county law approved in March by voters, Cynthia Coad, as the
board's chairwoman, must call the special election within three
business days of a vacancy.</TE>
<TE>   That gives her until Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But de Mayo is researching whether she can wait until Spitzer is
sworn in to his new post.</TE>
<TE>   Coad's time on the board is fleeting: She lost her seat in March
and will be replaced in January by Chris Norby of Fullerton.</TE>

<HD>Navajo 'Code Talker' Recalls War Service</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 79-year-old Navajo who stumped the Japanese during World War II
with his tribe's indecipherable language recounted Wednesday his
service as a Marine "code talker."</LD>
<LD>   Between 1943 and 1946, Joe Vandever Sr. was among nearly 400
Navajos attached to various units of the Marine Corps in the war's
Pacific theater.</LD>
<LD>   Using telephone and radio, the Navajos transmitted military
messages on tactics and troop movements in a modified form of their
native language. Enemy cryptographers never cracked the code, which
was declassified in 1968.</LD>
<TE>   The 2002 film "Windtalkers" was based on the code talkers'
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Vandever, who lives in New Mexico, spoke briefly Wednesday in Port
Hueneme to about 70 employees at Naval Base Ventura County. November
is Native American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month.</TE>
<TE>   Vandever, whose Navajo name means "going places," enlisted with
the Marines when he was 19.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went to San Diego, they picked me up and told me I was
going to be a code talker," he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Vandever went through boot camp at Camp Pendleton and then six
months of special training to memorize the Navajo code, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the code, for instance, fighter planes were known as
"da-he-tih-hi," or "hummingbirds." A submarine was a "besh-lo," or
"iron fish."</TE>
<TE>   "Turtle -- that means tank," Vandever said. He spoke Wednesday in
English and Navajo, aided by an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   Vandever traveled on 16 U.S. ships during his three years abroad.</TE>
<TE>   At rest stops, Vandever, who was a medicine man in his tribe, and
other code talkers built traditional sweat lodges using banana and
palm fronds. There, he said, they prayed for protection from the
Japanese.</TE>

<HD>Lawyers Want Separate Trials for Pair in Slaying</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys representing defendants Monica Diaz and Michael Naranjo,
accused of killing her uncle and three cousins, said in court
Wednesday that they plan to request separate trials for the two
19-year-olds.</LD>
<LD>   In the early hours of July 21, 2000, authorities say, Naranjo
sneaked into the family's four-bedroom home in a middle-class
neighborhood in Pico Rivera and, with Diaz's help, stabbed Richard
Flores, 42, his wife, Sylvia, 39, and three of their children:
Sylvia, 13; Matthew, 10; and Richard Jr., 17. Only the mother
survived. Diaz and her sister, who was not harmed that night, had
been raised by the Floreses since Diaz was 8.</LD>
<LD>   At the request of the defense attorneys, Los Angeles Superior
Court Judge Larry Knupp set the next hearing in the case for Feb. 6
at the Norwalk Courthouse.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe separate trials are almost invariably a fairer way to
give each defendant due process," Charles Cervantes, the deputy
public defender representing Naranjo, said after the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Hum, the prosecutor in the case, said he
would oppose any motion to try Naranjo and Diaz separately. The
teenagers are being held at the Twin Towers jail in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Extreme Fire Alert Declared in County</HD>
<DH>Dangerous mix of dry brush, Santa Ana winds and high
temperatures has officials on guard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl Kelley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to wind and record-breaking heat, Ventura County fire
officials declared an extreme fire danger situation Wednesday, then
dispatched a special anti-arson squad and a roving task force to
battle any emerging blazes.</LD>
<LD>   The fire danger -- described by officials as the worst of the
season -- was fueled by temperatures that broke records in three
cities.</LD>
<LD>   The 90-degree readings in Oxnard and Ojai broke 1954 records of 89
and 88, respectively. In Simi Valley, the mercury reached 84,
trumping the 1986 record of 82, according to the National Weather
Service.</LD>
<TE>   "The Santa Ana conditions mixed with the offshore winds, which
were pretty strong, made this some of the hottest weather of the
year," said meteorologist Bruce Rockwell.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Forest Service postponed a controlled burn planned for
4,800 acres in Los Padres National Forest near Frazier Park because
of dangerous conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too dry and too windy," said David Kerr of the Forest
Service in Ojai. "The physical elements just aren't lining up. We
have to wait to get out of the Santa Ana wind period."</TE>
<TE>   The burn may be rescheduled for Tuesday if it rains next week as
expected, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In the populated lowlands of Ventura County, the county Fire
Department heightened its firefighting preparations because strong
winds, low humidity and dry brush have increased the potential for
conflagration, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   All 31 county fire stations are fully staffed and extra fire
patrols have been dispatched, spokesman Joe Luna said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have three brush [engines] out with a 2,000-gallon water
tender, so if a fire breaks out, they're already on the road," he
said. "They traverse the whole county. And they have their own
immediate supply of water."</TE>
<TE>   Also on patrol Wednesday, Luna said, were special arson teams in
fire-prone canyons and hilly areas of the county.</TE>
<TE>   "They're in urban interface areas," where brushland is near homes,
he said. "They're our eyes and ears, reporting anything suspicious."</TE>
<TE>   The targeted areas include Piru, Simi Valley, Fillmore, Ojai,
Santa Paula Canyon and the Potrero Road area of Hidden Valley near
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The department's extreme fire alert is in effect indefinitely,
Luna said.</TE>
<TE>   A storm two weeks ago dropped up to 7 1/2 inches of rain on the
county's mountains and more than 4 inches on the coastal plains. It
was the first significant precipitation in 10 months, but trees and
brush did not gain enough moisture to be fire-resistant, officials
said.</TE>

<HD>Kim Gallagher, 38; Olympic Medalist Ran Through Pain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pain was a constant in Kim Gallagher's life -- but so was success as
a middle-distance runner.</LD>
<LD>   Gallagher, a two-time Olympic medalist whose third-place finish in
the women's 800-meter run at the Seoul Games in 1988 is considered
one of the sport's bravest performances, died Monday of a stroke at
Roxborough Memorial Hospital in Philadelphia. She was diagnosed with
stomach cancer in 1995 and had suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome
and other debilitating ailments during her running career. She was
38.</LD>
<LD>   Because she had trained with Coach Chuck DeBus, who was banned for
life by USA Track and Field for giving his athletes steroids and
other banned substances, Gallagher feared that observers would assume
she had taken steroids and that her cancer might be related to
steroid abuse. She steadfastly denied having taken steroids.</LD>
<TE>   "They weren't for kids," Gallagher told The Times in 1995. "I
didn't want to look like all those pumped-up, big-looking ...
talking-weird [women]. I liked my looks too much."</TE>
<TE>   Slender and willowy, Gallagher was a prodigy at Upper Dublin (Pa.)
High School, where she set national high school records in the 800
(2:00.07) and 1,500 (4:16.6) that stand 20 years later. At 15, she
set a Penn Relays record for the girls' high school mile with a time
of 4:49.2, which also stands as the event record.</TE>
<TE>   "She was so good so young," Villanova women's cross-country Coach
Gina Procaccio, a contemporary of Gallagher's, told the Philadelphia
Inquirer. "You could tell even back then how good she was."</TE>
<TE>   After a year at the University of Arizona, she moved to Southern
California to train in Santa Monica with the Los Angeles Track Club
and DeBus. She complained of stomach problems in 1983 and underwent
surgery for polycystic ovaries several months before the 1984 Los
Angeles Olympics, yet she finished second behind Doina Melinte of
Romania in the 800 with a time of 1:58.63.</TE>
<TE>   She left no doubt about her courage or skill at the 1988 Seoul
Olympics. By then having also battled anemia and an infection of the
fallopian tubes, she finished third in the 800 with a personal-best
time of 1:56.91, which puts her third on the U.S. all-time list for
the event behind Jearl Miles-Clark and Mary Decker Slaney. She also
was 11th in the 1,500.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I was being stabbed in the stomach," she said after
the 800, in which she was pinned by East German runners Sigrun Wodars
and Christine Wachtel and had to rally on the final lap to move up
from fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, her joy outweighed her pain, making the bronze worth more
than the silver medal she had won four years earlier. "I had the two
best 800 women in the world in front of me, and I was picked ninth
going into this race," said Gallagher, who wept on the medal stand.</TE>
<TE>   Gallagher tried to make the U.S. Olympic team again in 1992 but
failed. Her cancer was diagnosed three years later and she was told
she had two to three years to live. Her health deteriorated this
summer and she suffered a stroke in August.</TE>

daughter, Jessica Smith; her mother, Barbara, and her father, John.</TE>

<HD>Bert Granet, 92; Producer of 'Twilight Zone,'
'Untouchables'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bert Granet, the television writer and producer who helped bring such
classic series to the small screen as "Twilight Zone" and "The
Untouchables," has died. He was 92.</LD>
<LD>   Granet died Friday at a convalescent home in Santa Monica of
injuries suffered in a fall.</LD>
<LD>   The native New Yorker with a bachelor's degree from Yale began his
Hollywood career in 1934, and over the next four decades produced
nearly a dozen motion pictures and television shows or series, and
wrote scripts for 30 others.</LD>
<TE>   "The Untouchables," which Granet produced in 1959 with Robert
Stack as Treasury Agent Eliot Ness pursuing Al Capone and other
gangsters, may have proved the most enduring.</TE>
<TE>   The first series ran through 1963, and the concept was made into a
motion picture in 1987 starring Kevin Costner in the Ness role, and
re-created for a television series in 1993-94 with Tom Amandes as
Ness. The original series also became a model for other television
crime series in later years.</TE>
<TE>   But Granet's greatest impact on television history and science
fiction popularity was probably his role in getting Rod Serling's
"Twilight Zone" on the air in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Granet literally pulled the show off the shelf. That's where CBS
had stuck an episode titled "The Time Element," after buying it from
Serling. It was Serling's plan to use the script as a pilot for the
science fiction series he envisioned, but CBS was skittish about the
commercial value of science fiction.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Granet, an executive for Desilu Studios, was producer
of the "Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse."</TE>
<TE>   The weekly anthology series featured one show -- the most popular
-- starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz one week out of four and
other plays for the remaining three weeks. Granet, trying to build up
viewership on the other three weeks, started hiring top actors and
writers.</TE>
<TE>   When he asked Serling for a usable script, Serling suggested "The
Time Element" about a bartender returning to Pearl Harbor the day
before the Dec. 7, 1941, Japanese attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Using great persuasion ... I bought it for what was a lot of
money at that time -- $10,000," Granet said later.</TE>
<TE>   He ran into another major roadblock from Westinghouse's ad agency,
McCann-Erickson, which had script approval. The advertiser, they
said, would never accept a show with the ambiguous sort of ending
that became a hallmark of "Twilight Zone."</TE>
<TE>   But Arnaz backed Granet, and the show was produced starring
William Bendix, Darryl Hickman and Jesse White and aired Nov. 24,
1958. To appease the sponsor, Arnaz appeared at the end of the show
to provide his personal answer to what happened, explaining away time
travel by saying it was a character's dream.</TE>
<TE>   When the show garnered more audience reaction than any other
episode of "Desilu Playhouse" that year, CBS finally decided to take
a chance on Serling's series, "The Twilight Zone."</TE>
<TE>   "I was the first to like it, basically," Granet later told "The
Twilight Zone Companion" in explaining his role. "I fought very hard
because it was difficult to get it on the air. It's questionable
whether 'Twilight Zone' would have ever existed if I hadn't beat down
McCann-Erickson ... because they did not want that show nohow. At any
rate, the rest of it just became history."</TE>
<TE>   Among the motion pictures Granet produced were "Berlin Express" in
1948 and "The Marrying Kind" in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Charlotte
Lewis, and their daughter, Gaye.</TE>
<TE>   Granet requested that there be no services and no flowers. The
family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to the
donor's favorite charity or to the Motion Picture and Television
Fund, 22212 Ventura Blvd., Suite 300, Woodland Hills, CA 91364.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Signs Business Deals in China</HD>
<DH>The contracts will allow L.A. firms to bid on billions in
construction work needed for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, leading a delegation of business
executives -- some of whom helped defeat Hollywood and San Fernando
Valley secession efforts this month -- on Wednesday helped open doors
to China that may benefit those and other L.A. businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Under two agreements signed here between the Chinese capital and
the city of Los Angeles, Southern California companies will have the
opportunity to bid on construction and other projects in this
sprawling city, particularly in advance of the 2008 Summer Olympic
Games.</LD>
<LD>   The Chinese government is expected to spend about $23 billion to
prepare for the Games, including $7 billion just on infrastructure
improvements and additions.</LD>
<TE>   The agreements signed by Hahn make it possible for Los Angeles
construction, design, engineering and architectural firms to work on
such projects as the Beijing airport expansion, housing facilities,
hotels, stadiums and road and traffic improvements, among others.</TE>
<TE>   "The better the relationships here, the better the trade, the more
it benefits us in Los Angeles," said a beaming Ray Landy, president
of the DMJM architectural and engineering firm in Los Angeles.
"There's a lot of work to be done in China."</TE>
<TE>   DMJM donated $40,000 to L.A. United, the organization created by
Hahn to fight secession by the Valley and Hollywood. City voters
overwhelmingly rejected those two breakup proposals Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Baylis, vice president of CH2MHILL, said his firm already
works in China, and helped the Beijing government to prepare the
environmental portion of its application to host the Summer Games.
But he said a trip like this, where the mayor provides entree with
the government, could help Los Angeles companies that try to win
other contracts.</TE>
<TE>   CH2MHILL gave $20,000 to L.A. United. The engineering company HNTB
gave the mayor's anti-secession campaign $100,000; the firm's vice
president, Edward McSpedon, is traveling with Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the companies that are represented in Hahn's delegation
also do business in Los Angeles, and the trip provides them with the
opportunity to spend time the mayor and other city officials,
including City Council President Alex Padilla and Council members
Eric Garcetti and Janice Hahn. The general managers of the harbor and
the Department of Water and Power also are accompanying the mayor on
this trip.</TE>
<TE>   Baylis and others said it is helpful to hear the plans of the
mayor and council members, particularly as company executives
consider whether to bid on city projects.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Hahn said he chose executives from companies that
already have some business in Asia, giving them experience to draw on
as they seek to expand their operations in this part of the world.
The executives were not invited as payback, he added, but rather as a
way of helping the Los Angeles economy by expanding opportunities for
local companies to prosper abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Contreras, the head of the Los Angeles County Federation of
Labor who also is traveling with the mayor, said he did not know how
the executives were selected, but he added that it's clear that they
could have an advantage when it comes to working in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Airport Commissioner Leland Wong and others said there is nothing
wrong with giving Los Angeles companies a leg up; it ultimately helps
the city, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the potential benefits to Los Angeles companies, an
agreement signed here today with Beijing Capital Airport Group Corp.
could enable the Los Angeles airport department to be a consultant on
expansion plans here.</TE>
<TE>   Li Pei Ying, president of the Beijing Capital Airport Group, said
he has been impressed with the way Los Angeles International has
handled increases in passenger and cargo traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Under an agreement between the two cities' airports, senior
officials will meet at least once a year to share expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Depoian, deputy executive director of Los Angeles World
Airports, said the agreement with China on the Olympics also calls
for the city to play a role as the gateway city for travelers to the
Games.</TE>
<TE>   LAX is the only U.S. airport where three Chinese airlines have
hubs."This is a good opportunity for marketing," Depoian said after
the mayors of the cities signed the agreement at the historic Beijing
Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn flew on to Tokyo today to promote tourism in Los Angeles. He
will stop in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Taipei before heading home.</TE>

<HD>Jay D. Hair, 56; Made National Wildlife Federation Into a
Force for Change</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jay D. Hair, former head of the National Wildlife Federation,
credited with transforming the group into the nation's largest
grass-roots environmental organization and a powerful lobbying force,
has died. He was 56.</LD>
<LD>   Hair died Friday in his home in suburban Seattle of bone-marrow
cancer.</LD>
<LD>   During his tenure, from 1981 to 1995, Hair changed the
organization from something of a conservative sportsmen's club to a
6-million-member group of activists focused on environmental reform.
Membership has since declined to about 4.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   In his final year as head of the National Wildlife Federation,
Hair was elected president of the International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, an organization of
10,000 scientists, policymakers and volunteers from 181 countries.</TE>
<TE>   He held that position through 1996, when he presided over the
World Conservation Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Hair was a professor of zoology, forestry and wildlife biology who
grew up hunting and fishing and learning from his uncles what he
described as "the unspoken laws of sportsmanship and stewardship for
the land."</TE>
<TE>   He became intrigued with the potential of the National Wildlife
Federation when he attended a meeting of the organization in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Hair studied management and prepared himself to guide the group
into working for environmental goals.</TE>
<TE>   As a speaker and as writer of a column for the National Wildlife
Federation's magazine, he also became what the Washington Post once
described as "the most visible spokesman of mainstream
environmentalism."</TE>
<TE>   Hair was never afraid to express his strong views to leaders,
including a string of U.S. presidents.</TE>
<TE>   He cut his teeth on the effort to oust President Reagan's
controversial first secretary of the Interior, James Watt, who was
considered more interested in promoting business than the
environment.</TE>
<TE>   Initially reluctant to join the fray because most of his members
had voted for Reagan, Hair changed his mind when he learned that
members also overwhelmingly opposed Watt.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Watt resigned in 1983, Hair was recognized as a master
of public relations.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental spokesman also became a visible and tenacious
opponent of Reagan's short-tenured head of the Environmental
Protection Agency, Anne McGill Burford.</TE>
<TE>   Among Hair's key projects were making the federal Clean Air Act
tougher, reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone National Park and
reducing the flow of toxic waste into the Great Lakes.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Miami, Hair was 3 months old when his father left the
family and his mother moved her three children to her family's farm
in Indiana. She later married a DuPont chemical engineer in
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Hair earned a bachelor's degree in biology and a master's in
zoology at Clemson University in South Carolina. After a year as an
Army officer serving as a public health advisor in Vietnam, he earned
a doctorate in zoology from the University of Alberta in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   He taught at Clemson and North Carolina State University.</TE>
<TE>   As he became increasingly involved in environmental work, he
served as president of the South Carolina Wildlife Federation in
1976-77, the year it was chosen outstanding affiliate by the national
organization.</TE>
<TE>   The National Wildlife Federation recently named the education
center at its new Reston, Va., headquarters in Hair's honor.</TE>
<TE>   Hair is survived by his wife of nine years, Leah Knapp Hair; his
mother, Ruth Johnson of Newark, Del.; two daughters, Catherine Hair
of Apex, N.C., and Lindsay Hair of New York City; two stepsons, Colin
and Benjamin Patton of Seattle; a brother, Col. Dwight Hair of
Elkton, Md.; and a sister, Paulette Pyle of Avondale, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that any memorial donations be made either to
Long Live the Kings, which works to restore wild salmon; Global
Partnerships, which provides loans to needy villages in Latin
America; or the Biodiversity Fund of the World Conservation Union.</TE>

<KH>TIMES HOLIDAY FUND</KH>
<HD>Helping Young Sex Abuse Victims</HD>
<DH>Group's efforts to heal the pain after assaults extend to
adults and children as young as 2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne-Marie O'Connor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's jarring to meet them at the hospital: so young, so small, so
vulnerable. They are victims of rape or sexual molestation, many
younger than 12, some as young as 2. Their assailant might be a
neighbor, baby sitter, family friend or relative.</LD>
<LD>   Four years ago, Linda Shestock left a job as a chief financial
officer to become executive director of Project Sister Sexual
Assault, a group that helps these young people.</LD>
<LD>   "I had such respect for the work they do," Shestock said, "and I
have such a place in my heart for children."</LD>
<TE>   The group received a $15,000 grant from last year's Los Angeles
Times Holiday Campaign. During this holiday season, The Times is
featuring agencies and programs that have benefited from its annual
fund-raising effort.</TE>
<TE>   A stunning 50% of the 250 victims that Project Sister's advocates
met at the hospital last year were minors. Some were boys. Most were
women or girls, their assailants typically men known to the victims.</TE>
<TE>   "Sexual assault at any age is a violation of the most intimate
part of oneself," Shestock said. "Children often feel very betrayed,
very confused. How society supports the victim makes a difference."</TE>
<TE>   This is where Project Sister Sexual Assault comes in. From the
moment the group is contacted by a hospital, the police or through
the 24-hour Spanish-English hotline -- (909) 626-4357 or (626)
966-4155 -- an advocate is sent to accompany the victim through the
forensic exam and police questioning. Advocates speak several
languages, including Cantonese, Persian, Hindi and Mandarin.</TE>
<TE>   This sexual assault response team is only the first service
offered in the program's 700-square-mile service area, which includes
the eastern San Gabriel Valley, Pomona Valley and eastern San
Bernardino County, encompassing communities such as Azusa, Fontana,
Glendale, West Covina and Whittier.</TE>
<TE>   Victims receive counseling, therapy and referrals for long-term
needs.</TE>
<TE>   The group also works to prevent sexual violence through its
education programs. At schools, advocates tell teenagers how to avoid
being victimized -- or becoming a victimizer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for teenage boys to understand what sexual consent
is, to tell them, 'You don't have to force someone into sex just to
feel OK in your group,' " Shestock said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, teenage victims are silenced by fear, and it's up to
others to report the assault.</TE>
<TE>   "They say, 'I know a girl who was raped, but she's afraid to tell
anybody,' " Shestock said. "Rape in adolescence is something the girl
keeps hidden. Old myths and stigmas about sexual assault victims
become attached to her, such as 'She's not really telling the truth;
it was her fault; she dressed the wrong way.' "</TE>

<LD>Alfred Lewis Levitt, a Hollywood screenwriter who was blacklisted for
his involvement with the Communist Party, died Saturday in Los
Angeles of heart failure. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Levitt was subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities
Committee in 1951 but was not charged with any crime. The subpoena
was so damaging to his career, however, that he used an assumed name,
Tom August, for almost 20 years after his hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Long after the McCarthy era, Levitt led the effort to correct the
screen credits on dozens of Hollywood scripts whose writers, like
him, were forced to use a pseudonyms in the 1950s.</LD>
<TE>   Despite his frequent grumblings about television writing -- "It
grinds you down and has nothing to offer but money," he once said --
Levitt is best known for his work in popular television series. He
wrote for "The Donna Reed Show" in the 1950s, "The Brady Bunch" in
the '60s and "All in the Family" in the '70s. He often wrote scripts
with his wife, Helen Slotte Levitt, who died in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   His first movie credit was, "The Boy With Green Hair," in 1948. He
shared the credit with Betsy Beaton and Ben Barzman. He also wrote
feature film scripts with his wife, including "The Misadventures of
Merlin Jones" (1964) and "The Monkey's Uncle" (1965). He signed them
Tom August; she signed them Helen August.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, after Levitt began to put his own name on his work again,
he helped form the Hollywood Blacklist Writers Credits Committee. Its
members gradually corrected the script credits for dozens of movies
for which writers had used an assumed name, or a "front," a borrowed
name that actually belonged to one or another recognized Hollywood
screenwriter.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the Writers Guild of America West honored Levitt for this
revisionist work. By then the Blacklisted Writers Credits Committee
had restored accurate screen credits to 82 films, including those of
the Levitts.</TE>
<TE>   "Al stuck his neck out," said George Kirgo, a former president of
the Writers Guild of America West who helped form the Hollywood
Blacklist Writers Credits Committee with Levitt. "We wanted to help
set the record straight. Many in Hollywood behaved dishonorably
during the blacklist era. They were terrified. But the [credits]
committee was a great spur. It showed us writers at their best."</TE>
<TE>   Levitt was born in New York City and began his writing career as
the sports editor for the school paper at New York University's Bronx
campus. He joined several political groups as a student, including
the Young Communist League in 1932.</TE>
<TE>   "He saw communism as a way to achieve an egalitarian society,"
Levitt's son, Tom, said this week. By 1951 Levitt was disenchanted
with the party but when he was subpoenaed he believed that he could
not quit. "He didn't want to leave the party when it might appear he
left out of fear," said Levitt.</TE>
<TE>   He finally did quit in 1956 and from then on he rejected all
political ideologies and called himself a political agnostic, his son
said.</TE>
<TE>   Levitt came to Hollywood to work as a script reader in the late
1930s. He was drafted in 1942 and a year later he was sent to
England.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the war Levitt was sent to France where he met and
worked with Henri Cartier-Bresson, already a famous photographer, who
was making a film about the repatriation of prisoners of war and
concentration camp survivors. It was called "Reunion" ("Le Retour" in
French). Levitt helped write the film's narration and later said he
used the film to help get script-writing work in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   By 1950, several of the Hollywood producers Levitt had worked with
had been subpoenaed by the House committee and dropped by the
studios. He went through a similar experience when the movie "Dream
Wife" was in production in the early 1950s. Levitt's name is one of
three writers credited. (Sidney Sheldon and Herbert Baker are the
others.) But he was dropped from the project when he was subpoenaed.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than try to hide that he had been called by the House
committee, he decided to advertise it. "I might as well announce it
because ... they know anyway," he recalled in an interview for the
book, "Tender Comrades: A Backstory of the Hollywood Blacklist"
(1999).</TE>
<TE>   Levitt's ad began, "Like most of you I have been opposed to the
Un-American Activities Committee for a long time." No one would print
it.</TE>
<TE>   His hearing was in Los Angeles, where members of the House
Un-American Activities Committee came to listen to testimony. He
brought a statement to read, but he was not allowed to do so. In it
he defended the right to freedom of speech and expression of
individual conscience.</TE>
<TE>   He declared, "Every man has the right to be unpopular or even to
be wrong in these areas without suffering the consequences of
official censure, blacklisting or jail." And he concluded, "I shall
offer no cooperation to the evil purpose of these hearings, except
that which the force of law compels. I shall resist the committee in
every way that the Constitution provides."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after his own hearing, Levitt got calls from several
Hollywood colleagues who had been subpoenaed. They asked him for
help, and he wrote a speech for them to deliver at their hearings. He
never revealed their names.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Levitt taught script-writing classes at several
schools, including Cal State Northridge. He worked on a Writers Guild
project to supplement the pensions of blacklisted writers. He served
on the guild's board from 1981-84 and was secretary-treasurer from
1985-89.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son Tom, Levitt is survived by his daughter,
Ann, two grandchildren and a brother.</TE>
<TE>   Donations in his name can be made to the Alzheimer's Assn., 5900
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1700, Los Angeles, CA 90036.</TE>

<HD>Game Wardens' Surveillance of Lobster Harvest Nets Arrests</HD>
<DH>Officials say they caught two fishermen off Dana Point with
110 of the crustaceans that were too small to keep legally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The game wardens watched the two fishermen for hours as they plucked
one lobster after another from the traps and tossed them into their
boat bobbing off the coast of Dana Point.</LD>
<LD>   When confronted back at port, state Fish and Game agents said, the
fishermen told them not to bother measuring their catch because the
men knew the 100 or so lobsters they snared were too small.</LD>
<LD>   For those who patrol the waters for lobster rustlers, Monday's
bust was significant. The seizure was one of the largest in a decade
in Southern California and underscored the importance Fish and Game
officials put on protecting the native crustacean, whose numbers
dropped sharply in the 1970s when poaching was at a peak.</LD>
<TE>   The case was also unusual because the skipper of the boat has a
lobster permit, making him one of only 225 fishermen in the state
granted the lifelong right to harvest legal-sized lobsters.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, as the lobster population slowly climbed,
poachers--not the licensed lobster fishermen--have been viewed as the
leading threat to the California spiny lobster.</TE>
<TE>   "This was shocking," Fish and Game Lt. Chris Graff said. "Usually
we get poachers who have no licenses of any kind, and here the guy's
a commercial fisherman. If he wanted to plan any kind of career in
fishing, he just shot himself in the foot."</TE>
<TE>   If found guilty, Harvey Gonzalez, 22, of San Juan Capistrano and
his crew member, Roddy Giacomini, 25, of Vista, could each face a
maximum $110,000 fine, prison time, the loss of their commercial
fishing and lobster permits and the seizure of their boat. Neither
could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the men were caught with 110 baby lobsters, all
too small for legal harvesting. The estimated value of the catch was
roughly $1,000. California lobsters sell for as much as $12 a pound.</TE>
<TE>   Game wardens said the fishermen told them they did not intend to
sell the lobsters on the black market. Fish and Game agents
periodically check restaurants and fish markets, making sure the
lobsters are of a legal size.</TE>
<TE>   More often, game wardens concentrate on commercial fishing vessels
such as gill netters and hook-and-line fishermen, not those working
the lobster pots. But in this case, the wardens had received a tip
and had had the two men under surveillance for days.</TE>
<TE>   Wardens watched them from the deck of the Thresher, one of three
Fish and Game boats patrolling the ocean from the Mexican border to
Ventura to 200 miles offshore, Graff said.</TE>
<TE>   As a rule, officials said, licensed lobster fishermen toss back
about five short lobsters for every legal one they keep. But as the
warden watched the two men Monday, they threw back only five lobsters
during their lengthy fishing session, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   After hauling in the last trap, Gonzalez allegedly maneuvered his
boat quickly back to dock where the catch was shifted to a car. The
men were stopped leaving the dock by game wardens, who said that of
the 116 lobsters stowed in the car, only six were of legal size. Of
the seized lobsters, authorities said, all but four -- kept for
evidence -- were returned to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   When word spread of the alleged illegal catch, it angered other
lobster fishermen who make their livelihood pulling up hundreds of
traps during a season that lasts from the first week in October until
March 15.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they lose their permit," said John Guth, president of the
California Lobster and Trap Fishermen's Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Rainforth, one of the few women in the state licensed to
hunt for lobster, said the incident angered her.</TE>
<TE>   Lobster harvesting has been slow lately, she said. On Wednesday,
for instance, out of 80 lobster traps she tends off the San Onofre
nuclear power plant, she pulled in 30 lobsters, not enough to warrant
meeting up with a buyer.</TE>
<TE>   Lobster fishermen say they average about $60,000 during the
six-month season. In good years, when large storms stir up the
bottom, they can earn $90,000 or more. But lately the weather has
been mild and the lobster fishing has been slow, said another
fisherman, Mark Larkins, 42.</TE>
<TE>   To be legal, lobsters must measure at least 3 1/4 inches from the
eye socket to the rear edge of their shell. It takes seven to 11
years for lobsters to reach legal size.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial fishermen enter a lottery to get a lobster permit. But
once one is issued, "it's for life," Graff said, "that is until the
fisherman dies or quits the business," or has it stripped for
violations.</TE>

<HD>No DNA Match in Mannheimer Case</HD>
<DH>Evidence tying man to beating of his ex-wife is lacking, a
jury is told, but inquiry is still open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Within a day of the savage beating of his ex-wife, Westlake Village
businessman Lee Mannheimer was identified by law enforcement as the
likely suspect who entered her home and cracked open her skull with a
metal flashlight.</LD>
<LD>   But after three years, a detective testified Wednesday, the
Ventura County Sheriff's Department still has no physical evidence
linking him to the near-fatal attack.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, homicide detective Tim Lorenzen told a civil jury that
DNA tests on tissue and blood samples collected at the crime scene do
not match Mannheimer.</LD>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Lorenzen testified that investigators do not believe
accountant Linda Morrisset was the victim of a random robbery inside
her former Camarillo-area home.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation remains open, Lorenzen said, and investigators
have not ruled out Mannheimer as a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer, 59, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
after Morrisset, now 51, awoke from a coma and identified him as the
intruder who bludgeoned her with a flashlight on Sept. 11, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer was released after prosecutors determined they did not
have enough evidence to file charges. She later sued him for assault
and battery. The trial got underway last week in Ventura County
Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset testified that Mannheimer was a bully during their
nine-year marriage and treated their son, Maxx, 12, as a possession.</TE>
<TE>   After their divorce, she said, disputes over a joint child custody
agreement continued and boiled over on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset contends that her former spouse entered the house where
she was staying alone that night and beat her. She is now partly
paralyzed and uses a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer denies beating Morrisset. He testified this week that
he was home asleep when the attack occurred.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, his former au pair testified that Mannheimer went to
bed about 10:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzen was called to the stand late Wednesday by Morrisset's
lawyer to reveal details of the criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives concluded that Morrisset was attacked in the hallway of
her home, where a nanny found her the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   At least four indentations, which Lorenzen characterized as
"strike marks" from a weapon, were found on the oak-paneled floor
near Morrisset's head.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzen said investigators believe those marks corroborate her
statement that she was attacked with a heavy metal flashlight. He
said the patterns may suggest she tried to crawl away from her
attacker.</TE>
<TE>   A day after the attack, investigators interviewed Mannheimer, who
appeared nervous, the detective said, but cooperated with deputies.</TE>
<TE>   In his cross-examination, Greg Ramirez, Mannheimer's attorney,
focused on Morrisset's statements to investigators.</TE>
<TE>   After awaking from a 16-day coma, she told detectives that
Mannheimer beat her with his fists. Lorenzen said she later told them
he used a blue flashlight, then said it was black.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzen acknowledged that Morrisset also gave conflicting
statements about the time of the attack, whether she saw her son and
ex-husband that day and what her assailant was wearing.</TE>

<LD>Attorneys for Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. will meet with prosecutors
Monday in an effort to settle a criminal charge the company is facing
for bulldozing a streambed on the site of the proposed 21,600-home
Newhall Ranch subdivision.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County district attorney charged the company in
September with one misdemeanor count of altering a streambed after
officials from the California Department of Fish and Game noticed the
damage in a flyover of the site near Santa Clarita.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which has pleaded not guilty to the charge, faces up
to $1,000 in fines if convicted. If a settlement is not reached, a
jury trial will begin next week in Los Angeles County Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   Newhall Land was also the subject of a recent investigation by
state Fish and Game officials who suspected the company was
destroying habitats of the San Fernando Valley spineflower, a
state-listed endangered species, on the site of the proposed
subdivision. Fish and Game investigators searched the site in May and
found evidence of the flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Maureen O'Brien said Wednesday that the
district attorney's office declined to file charges in the case
because it was submitted after the one-year statute of limitations
had expired.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall Land spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer said Wednesday that the
company had done nothing wrong: "From the beginning we've said there
have been no violations."</TE>
<TE>   The Newhall Ranch project, which would be one of the largest in
the county, was initially approved by the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors in early 1999, but environmental groups and others
challenged the project in court, arguing that its environmental
review was insufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors will consider a revised environmental report on Jan.
28. It is to include updated information on the company's plans to
protect the spineflower and an endangered sunflower found on the site
this year.</TE>

<LD>Talk about the strong, silent type. On a bus tour through China, Jack
Takeshita of Pacoima snapped a shot of a life-size plastic figure,
"whose intent, I presume, was to caution drivers to obey the traffic
laws" (see photo). And how effective was it?</LD>
<LD>   Said Takeshita: "Since our bus and the other vehicles were
hurtling down this mountain road at breakneck speed, I doubt the
drivers even had time to take their eyes off the road to observe the
mannequin."</LD>
<LD>   Which reminds me: Faux traffic officers are not unknown to
Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   A few years ago, residents off Beverly Glen Boulevard stationed a
cut-out of a retired LAPD officer at an intersection -- Port-a-Cop,
they called it (see photo). Then there was Officer Les, a retired
department store mannequin, who used to occupy a worn-out squad car
on the Westside. Some passersby found his stillness so eerie that
they phoned police to say Les was a dead body.</TE>
<TE>   And the Long Beach Police Department had Officer Wax Works, a
handsome, mustachioed (of course) mannequin who worked multiple
shifts (see photo). Alas, Works was an innocent by-sitter in the
rivalry between the Long Beach Police and Fire departments. After
Zeep the Sheep, the front-lawn mascot of one firehouse, was painted
black and white and plastered with police stickers, someone stole the
bottom half of Works' torso.</TE>
<TE>   Wax Works worked several months longer, without uttering a
complaint, before the rest of his body fell apart.</TE>
<TE>   Famous last words: At a local cemetery, John Boyle of South
Pasadena came upon the marker of someone who obviously had a sense of
humor (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   I'd have to say the inscription ranks right up there with those of
such folks as cartoon voice Mel Blanc ("That's All Folks"), comic
Ernie Kovacs ("Nothing in Moderation"), actor Richard Conte
("1910-1975-?"), gossipy sportscaster Jim Healy ("Is It True?") and
actress Joan Hackett ("Go away, I'm asleep").</TE>
<TE>   Flights of fancy? Referring to a report that said that the main
thing in people's minds when they choose an airline flight is the
price, KFWB-AM radio anchor Dave Williams quipped that he always

<HD>Oxnard Approves 75-Acre Park, but Rehab Center Must
Relocate</HD>
<DH>Women's substance abuse recovery house is deemed a poor fit
with $20-million recreation area. It has at least a year to find a
new home.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two years of contentious debate, the Oxnard City Council has
approved the largest park in the city's history -- a 75-acre,
$20-million spread of soccer fields, baseball diamonds, dog parks and
a farm museum.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-2 vote came after hours of emotional debate from city
residents concerned with the fate of a women's drug and alcohol
recovery center, which was left out of the College Park plan and will
have to relocate.</LD>
<LD>   The eviction of the Rainbow Recovery Center was the latest in a
number of controversies over how best to use the land. For years,
sports, nature and history buffs have battled to ensure that their
interests would be included in the park.</LD>
<TE>   City officials stressed that they tried to do their best by the
community and all its varying interests.</TE>
<TE>   Highlights of the plan include:</TE>
<TE>   * Two dog parks, one for big and one for small animals.</TE>
<TE>   * A fenced skate park.</TE>
<TE>   * A 26,000-square-foot community center with a gym.</TE>
<TE>   * Fields for baseball, softball and soccer, and a lighted
basketball area.</TE>
<TE>   The plan approved Tuesday calls for the Ventura County Museum of
History and Art to occupy the two old farmhouses that the recovery
center now uses. One would be dedicated to the county's agricultural
history.</TE>
<TE>   The recovery center, which serves up to 22 women, has until
January 2004 to find a new location, and the city has said it will
not formally agree to any museum construction plans until the
recovery center finds a home.</TE>
<TE>   But the center's director says she has no idea where she will find
an adequate facility in a welcoming neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "I just really hope they keep their word and they can find
something appropriate," said Kathleen McQuillan. "The facilities
offered by Rainbow are in very short supply in Ventura County and
Oxnard, and closing it down is a disservice to the women and the best
interests of the community."</TE>
<TE>   For more than two hours, residents, Rainbow alumni and even a
local minister made similar arguments; but city officials ultimately
decided that although the "Rainbow ladies" are important, the farm
heritage museum was a better fit for College Park.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of those issues where it's become very emotional,"
said Councilman Tom Holden. "This council hasn't said at any point
that the Rainbow Recovery Center needs to be folded." The museum and
the recovery center "are both very valuable resources. What makes
sense is to find a new home for Rainbow House."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Manuel Lopez and Mayor Pro Tem John Zaragoza voted against
the master plan.</TE>
<TE>   "The way it turned out was that we had to make a choice between
the two, and I found very little fairness in displacing these women
who have worked very hard over the years," Lopez said. "I think it
was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Gary Gillig stressed that although the plan was passed,
College Park is still many years away.</TE>
<TE>   "Last night was a highly preliminary step," Gillig said. "This is
an evolutionary process. I'm sure the staff will be back to discuss
further issues."</TE>
<TE>   The next pressing issue will be how to finance the park's
$20-million cost. City staff said the most viable option would be to
create an assessment district.</TE>
<TE>   Under that plan, all Oxnard homeowners would be assessed about $25
a year, which would raise about $1.2 million annually. Another option
would be for the city to attempt to tap into a $2.6-billion state
bond measure approved earlier this year. The city could also apply
for state and federal park funds.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the skate park, the only section that the city
already has the money to start building, will not begin for at least
another two years, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Godwin, 61, has been hearing about the new and improved
College Park since she moved to Oxnard in the mid-1970s. For the most
part, she said, she likes the park concept and would like to see it
finally become a reality.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the last big park that'll ever be developed in Oxnard,"
Godwin said. "We thought this would be something our children would
play in. We're grandparents now and we're still waiting, but it
finally seems to be moving forward."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>John J. Whitacre, 50, a onetime shoe salesclerk who became the only
head of the Nordstrom clothing chain outside the founding family,
died of a heart attack Monday in Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Whitacre, who started the company's $300-million Internet catalog
business, became Nordstrom's chief executive in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   The popular yet press-shy Whitacre nearly doubled the size of the
chain, but resigned in August 2000 as earnings dropped and a
$40-million "Reinvent Yourself" campaign backfired.</LD>
<TE>   Whitacre moved to London in 2001 to manage Harrods department
store but returned to Seattle this year to be near his father, who
was in declining health. At the time of his death, Whitacre was
working as a consultant and doing community service.</TE>

<HD>Pot Raids Spur Calls to Quit Working With DEA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Bailey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Reacting to raids of California medical marijuana cooperatives by the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, several cities around the state
are pushing local police to stop cooperating with federal agents.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council of Sebastopol became the latest to approve a
resolution supporting California's medical marijuana law and asking
that the municipal police force avoid working with the DEA.</LD>
<LD>   Sebastopol's vote Tuesday night is expected to be followed in a
few weeks by similar action in neighboring Santa Rosa.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this year, city leaders in Berkeley and San Francisco
approved anti-DEA resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   In San Jose, Police Chief William Lansdowne in October pulled his
officers from a DEA task force, citing a "clear conflict between
federal and state law" and saying methamphetamine was a far greater
problem than marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Cruz council members, meanwhile, in September invited
leaders of a busted medical pot cooperative to distribute marijuana
as medicine from the front steps of City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Such efforts have been almost entirely symbolic, and each of those
cities was among the most proactive in the state to enact Proposition
215, California's landmark 1996 medical marijuana measure.</TE>
<TE>   Though it won voter approval, Proposition 215 created a legal
quandary for police and the courts because the medical pot measure
conflicts with federal law declaring marijuana illegal for any
purpose.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis have for several
years balked at attempts by medical marijuana activists to push
through bills to create statewide standards for cannabis patients.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, federal drug agents
have stepped in during the past year to raid several medical
marijuana dispensaries that enjoyed good working relationships with
local political leaders and police.</TE>
<TE>   Among the busts were the closure of the Los Angeles Cannabis
Cooperative last year and raids of several San Francisco pot clubs as
DEA Administrator Asa Hutchinson visited the Bay Area earlier this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The DEA also has started to set its sights lower, arresting a
medical marijuana activist in San Diego who was cultivating 25
plants. Traditionally, federal agents have focused exclusively on
major drug traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has called the recent raids
"punitive expeditions" that are an affront to the will of
California's electorate.</TE>
<TE>   Sebastopol's move comes a few months after the DEA raided a large
medical marijuana operation in a residential area just outside city
limits after it became a nightmare for neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Larry Robinson said that raid and the bust of the
respected Santa Cruz cooperative prodded the City Council to act.</TE>
<TE>   "This is mostly a statement of our support for California's right
to set its own laws instead of having those preempted by the federal
government," said Robinson, who joined with the majority in the 3-1
vote. "We just want to add our voice to the opposition."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson said Sebastopol Police Chief Gordon Pitter has vowed that
his officers, who rarely work with the DEA anyway, will uphold the
will of the council.</TE>
<TE>   But some medical marijuana activists warn that there are no
guarantees.</TE>
<TE>   Dale Gieringer, state coordinator for the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said activists will meet with
Lockyer aides soon to complain about five police officers from Bay
Area cities -- including San Francisco -- who have been "cooperating
notoriously" with the DEA.</TE>
<TE>   "When a city passes a resolution, it doesn't mean anything
really," Gieringer said. "Police do what they damn well please."</TE>

<LD>The arraignment for Mark Wayne Rathbun, suspected by police of being
the Belmont Shore serial rapist, was postponed Wednesday until Dec.
4.</LD>
<LD>   The 32-year-old Rathbun, wearing an orange jail uniform, looked at
the floor during the short proceeding.</LD>
<LD>   He softly answered, "Yes, your honor," when he was asked if he
agreed to give up his right to a speedy trial. Bail had been set at
$11 million for Rathbun last week, but Long Beach Superior Court
Judge Patrick Madden on Wednesday ordered him held without bail.</LD>
<TE>   During the proceeding, Madden allowed a television cameraman and
newspaper photographer into the courtroom but refused to let them
take Rathbun's picture.</TE>
<TE>   The ban was justified, Madden said, because witness identification
of Rathbun could be an issue during the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Rathbun has been charged with 64 counts of burglary and sexual
assault. The attacks -- many of which occurred in the Belmont Shore
area of Long Beach -- go as far back as 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Kenneth McDonald requested the arraignment delay.
"The people have had five years," he said outside the courtroom. "We
have had five days."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Goul said he would not agree to a delay
beyond Dec. 4. He said some of the victims are elderly and they want
to see the case go forward soon.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald noted outside the courtroom that police had mistakenly
accused another man of attacks tied to the Belmont Shore rapist.</TE>
<TE>   A federal jury awarded $1.7 million to Jeff Grant, a Long Beach
city employee, who was wrongly arrested in 1998. The city is
appealing that verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the first person who has been arrested," McDonald
said. "I think everyone has to keep an open mind."</TE>

Mexican migrants were sentenced Wednesday to county jail.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors and migrants-rights activists had recommended prison.
But Superior Court Judge James Milliken said that the three had no
previous criminal records and that sending them to prison would turn
them into hardened criminals.</LD>
<LD>   Adam Ketsdever and Bradley Davidofsky were given two years in
county jail for the July 2000 attack in which five migrants were

<LD>A receptionist for the Sacramento County Bar Assn. has been arrested,
accused of stealing credit card numbers from more than 50 people,
most of them lawyers, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Noelle Malone, 30, processed payments to the association,
including membership renewals made by check or credit cards.</LD>
<LD>   Malone was arrested last week on charges of identity theft and
conspiracy. She allegedly shared the numbers with Tishawna Holeman,
25, a convicted scam artist. Holeman was charged with possession of
stolen card numbers with intent to commit fraud.</LD>

<LD>The Davis administration Wednesday moved to protect HMO members who
unwittingly lose their medical coverage when an employer fails to pay
premiums in a timely fashion.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis directed the Department of Managed Health Care to
develop regulations to prohibit "phantom coverage." This occurs when
an employer tries to save money by delaying HMO premium payments and
the HMO suspends a patient's coverage without notice.</LD>
<LD>   The regulations would require HMOs to notify patients directly
when that happens.</LD>

<LD>The U.S. Senate passed a modest California water provision early
Wednesday, but it was unclear whether the House would take up the
measure in the waning hours of the 107th Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The measure would allow federal participation for the next three
years in the California Federal Bay-Delta Program, which is designed
to address water problems ranging from the San Francisco Bay Area to
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   CalFed is intended to restore the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as
well as ensure a reliable supply of water for farmers and municipal

<LD>A nonprofit group is proposing to take over Nystrom Elementary
School, a downtrodden campus where academic achievement and family
income rank among the lowest in Contra Costa County, and turn it into
an alternative public school.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal from the Richmond Children's Foundation, a nonprofit
created from leftover settlement money from a 1993 General Chemical
explosion, would maintain Nystrom as a neighborhood school in the
West Contra Costa school district, but free the campus from some
union rules and financial constraints that other district schools
must uphold.</LD>

<HD>Stanford, Big Energy Team Up on Emissions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanford University and a group of giant energy corporations unveiled
plans Wednesday for a research project that will spend as much as
$225 million over the next decade to develop lower-emissions energy
technologies.</LD>
<LD>   The Global Climate and Energy Project will team one of America's
premier research universities with ExxonMobil Corp., General Electric
Co. and Schlumberger Ltd. in combating greenhouse gas emissions
linked to global warming.</LD>
<LD>   The project is expected to grow to include additional universities
and companies.</LD>
<TE>   It is by far the largest corporate-sponsored research project at
Stanford and one of the largest at any U.S. university.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a unique opportunity for Stanford to work on one of the
most important problems we face as a global society and to have the
kind of resources and the long-term commitment that will be necessary
to make real progress," Stanford President John Hennessy said in a
telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly a very dramatic acknowledgment that we have a
fundamental conflict between the rising energy demands of the
developing world and the need to sustain an environment that we can
all continue to live in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists, while acknowledging that the Stanford
project represents a potentially major contribution to energy
research, reacted cautiously.</TE>
<TE>   They said the project's donors operate fossil-fuel businesses that
contribute to global warming, raising the possibility of conflicts of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm somewhat skeptical, given the history of some of the
companies involved in this, that it represents a dramatic change in
their resistance to aggressive federal and state policy action on the
issue," said Alden M. Meyer, director of government relations for the
Union of Concerned Scientists.</TE>
<TE>   ExxonMobil, Meyer said, has been one of the leading skeptics on
the issue of climate change.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be seen as another effort [by ExxonMobil] to say,
'We're doing something, but this is a complex problem that's going to
take decades to solve and, in the meantime, let's not do anything
aggressive with fuel economy standards or anything else that actually
reduces oil use today,' " he added.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the announcement reflected a bid for a market-based
approach to environmental protection by a group of companies that in
the past have thrived in the energy field and could be hurt by
tighter government rules.</TE>
<TE>   Hennessy said at a news conference at Stanford's campus in Silicon
Valley that the backers of the project "recognize that solutions must
meet the test of practicality and cost...."</TE>
<TE>   "One of our roles will be to identify and overcome any barriers to
success -- from safety issues to regulation, to the economics of
implementation."</TE>
<TE>   He cited an array of options for research, including some areas
favored by industry and others endorsed by environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   Areas of Research</TE>
<TE>   Those include electric power generation systems with low
greenhouse gas emissions; renewable energy sources, such as wind and
solar power; and use of biomass fuels, which are derived from
agricultural and other organic wastes.</TE>
<TE>   But Hennessy also mentioned advanced nuclear power technologies, a
field that raises deep concerns for some environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   Frank B. Sprow, vice president for safety, health and environment
at Irving, Texas-based ExxonMobil, said that some ways suggested
previously to address emissions-related climate problems "run the
risk of impairing economic growth substantially, particularly in
developing countries."</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that cost-effective actions to address the risk of
climate change must be pursued," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Steps must be in hand that are both environmentally sound and
economic, so the critical need for economic growth and improvement in
living standards is met worldwide."</TE>
<TE>   Hennessy said various protections will ensure that Stanford's
academic integrity is not compromised during the project.</TE>
<TE>   "We select final research projects, and the faculty make their
individual decisions to publish," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no ability by our sponsors to prevent publication."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford has named Lynn Orr as project director. He has been dean
of Stanford's School of Earth Sciences for the last eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Orr's deputy director will be Christopher F. Edwards, a member of
the Stanford faculty since 1995 and an associate professor in the
thermosciences division of the mechanical engineering department.</TE>
<TE>   Hennessy said the energy companies spoke with other universities
before asking Stanford to lead the project.</TE>
<TE>   Although Stanford has not yet talked with other universities about
collaborating on the project, he specifically named the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology as a possible partner.</TE>
<TE>   He said negotiations are near the final stages to include another
energy company, Munich, Germany-based E.ON Energie Group, in the
project.</TE>
<TE>   ExxonMobil is the world's largest oil company, General Electric is
a leading maker of power generators, and Schlumberger provides
technology services for the oil, gas and utilities industries.</TE>
<TE>   The project, Hennessy said, "is not completely unorthodox in that
we've had other research collaborations funded by industrial
consortia. But it is unorthodox in the scope and size of the
initiative....</TE>
<TE>   "It's a natural step, albeit a big one, beyond what we've had in
the past."</TE>
<TE>   One of the few corporate-sponsored research projects larger than
the Stanford initiative is at the State University of New York at
Albany.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the university announced plans for a $400-million,
five-year project to develop semiconductor research and facilities.
Some of that project, however, is to be funded with state money.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS TARZANA'S SLEEPY HOLLOW LANE</KH>
<HD>Neighbors Are Seeing Red Over Blue Movies</HD>
<DH>Nearby homeowners draw their drapes and grumble. Permit

<DL></DL>
<LD>As the leafy glen turns golden and bronze and lengthening autumn
shadows fall over leftover Halloween pumpkins, the new legend of
Sleepy Hollow is being written in Tarzana.</LD>
<LD>   Washington Irving isn't penning this tale -- even though his famed
182-year-old description of the "bevy of buxom lasses" and the
"strange sights" that hold "a spell over the minds of the good
people" living in a secluded "lap of land among high hills, which is
one of the quietest places in the whole world," isn't far off the
mark.</LD>
<LD>   For more than three months, tiny Sleepy Hollow Lane in one of Los
Angeles' most tranquil residential neighborhoods has been turned into
an impromptu stage for adult filmmaking.</LD>
<TE>   Nearby homeowners say they are forced to draw their drapes and
lock their children inside their $1-million homes when porn movie
actors and production crews show up for 12-hour film shoots at a
handsome, white-stuccoed house on the end of the lane's cul-de-sac.</TE>
<TE>   Since August, eight adult films have been shot there, according to
filming permit records. On Wednesday, another production company,
Video Bliss, showed up, to the dismay of neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Angry residents contend city leaders and officials who issue film
production permits have been slow to respond to complaints about the
turmoil that the movie-making is causing in the 45-year-old hilltop
neighborhood two miles south of the Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Their grumbling has prompted the Entertainment Industry
Development Corp., the quasi-public organization that issues the
permits, to take a close look at the filming.</TE>
<TE>   The owner of the house said he was unaware of his neighbors'
unhappiness, however. He denied that the filming is having any impact
on others.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Marc Smith said he and his wife decided to rent out their
home for adult films on a whim after their three boys went off to
college.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't like we put an ad in the paper, 'House Available for
Porno Shoot.' They came to us. I'm not in that business. Somebody
came months ago and solicited us," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Sleepy Hollow Lane dispute illustrates the continuing
balancing act that Angelenos, entertainment industry workers and city
officials must perform in order to keep filming activity in Los
Angeles -- and at the same time keep residents happy.</TE>
<TE>   After a decline in filming last year, local production has
rebounded, according to the EIDC. As many as 200 location shoots a
day take place outside studios. Officials say they do not know how
many of the 40,000 or so Los Angeles shoots a year take place in
residential areas.</TE>
<TE>   Mainstream filmmakers say they pick neighborhood backdrops because
of the architectural style or the type of trees growing there.</TE>
<TE>   Adult-film production crews apparently like the modern interior
look of the Smiths' house, which the owner said can be filmed so that
it resembles such settings as a corporate boardroom or a nightclub.
The home's secluded and opulent backyard swimming pool is also an
attraction.</TE>
<TE>   The backyard is apparently not isolated enough, however. One film
company reportedly ordered a 10-year-old girl playing in a
neighboring yard to go into her house before the cameras started
rolling for one explicit scene.</TE>
<TE>   "She could see what was going on through the fence. I had to
explain to her what a porn movie was. She said she didn't know they
made movies like that -- she's a kid," said the girl's mother, who
asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor, Val Cowley, objected to scantily clad actresses
going in and out of the house and occasionally being filmed on the
small front lawn.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a 13-year-old son. It's not the kind of thing I want him
exposed to," said the mother of four. "We chose a family neighborhood
when we moved here. This is just not the environment we want."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors recognized immediately that adult fare was being
produced on Sleepy Hollow Lane, said Martin Grant, who lives on
nearby Aleman Drive.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't have a wardrobe truck -- they didn't need one. It was
just 20 guys showing up in pickups and SUVs," he explained.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a prude, but this is too much," said homeowner Marilyn
Kelliher. "I don't mind filming once or twice. But every other week
is too much."</TE>
<TE>   Other neighbors complain that production trucks and cars driven by
cast and crew members clog nearby streets and sometimes block
driveways. Some have worked past midnight with bright lights.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion, a production crew's catering truck tapped into
her front-yard garden hose without permission, one resident said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Sherman, who has lived in the neighborhood since 1971,
said neighbors believe it is a violation of zoning laws to conduct a
filming business in a residential area. That it's adult fare makes it
all the worse.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of children in the neighborhood now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sexy Girls Next Door" was being shot last week by Playboy
Enterprises. A large "Playboy TV" sign bearing the Playboy bunny logo
was affixed to the front of the Smith house.</TE>
<TE>   In the street, two camera crews filmed three actresses exiting a
stretch limo and entering the house.</TE>
<TE>   The street filming was illegal. So was the catering truck parked
on the cul-de-sac and the line of 20 crew and cast vehicles parked
nearby, according to EIDC officials.</TE>
<TE>   The film crew's $450 permit--which is good for two weeks and 10
different locations -- authorized filming only on the Smiths'
property, not a public street, said Darryl M. Seif, vice president
and general manager of operations for the EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   The catering truck should have been on the Smiths' property too,
and the private cars should have been out of the neighborhood
altogether under terms of the permit, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And any areas used for nudity or sex scenes must be screened or
"draped" so they are not visible to the public, Seif said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of neighbors' complaints, Seif said he plans to call the
Smiths in for a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though the production company is the responsible party, the
homeowner should monitor too," Seif said.</TE>
<TE>   Playboy spokesman Scott Barton said he plans to discuss last
week's filming with the production crew, which he said was producing
soft-core nude footage -- not sex scenes.</TE>
<TE>   While the city does not generally limit the amount of filming that
can occur at any location, "we'll step in if they are turning a house
into a commercial property," said Kathleen Milnes, an EIDC
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Smith seemed surprised that filming was done using
the front of his house as a backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be devastated if there was anything like that in the
movie. I'd be devastated if anything in our house was recognizable,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said he is prepared to immediately stop the filming --
provided neighbors "come to us and say they are offended -- and it's
not about jealousy or the money" he and his wife receive. That varies
from about $800 to $2,000 a day, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd stop if somebody has a legitimate beef. I'm very sensitive,"
Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where we live," he said. "I don't want to ruin their
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   So they're waiting to see what happens next along Sleepy Hollow
Lane, with its shimmering fall colors and its growing local
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   As Washington Irving put it: "The whole neighborhood abounds with
local tales...."</TE>

<HD>Oak's Supporters Rally for a Study</HD>
<DH>Activists at downtown protest call for an environmental
analysis of road project that threatens ancient tree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Chambers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Activist John Quigley neared the three-week mark sitting high in the
boughs of an ancient oak near Santa Clarita on Wednesday as
supporters rallied in downtown Los Angeles to save the tree they call
Old Glory.</LD>
<LD>   At a noontime demonstration at the Los Angeles County Hall of
Administration, actress Rene Russo joined dozens of tree supporters
in calling for a full environmental study of a road-widening project
that requires removal of the 400-year-old oak.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the unincorporated area
of Stevenson Ranch where the tree is situated, this week proposed
that the oak be moved to another site. The plan would cost an
estimated $250,000, which would be paid by the developer of a nearby
subdivision.</LD>
<TE>   But Antonovich's plan has sparked a debate over whether moving
such a large old tree with deep roots would kill it. Quigley and his
supporters believe the plan is ill-conceived and not the solution to
the standoff.</TE>
<TE>   During Wednesday's demonstration, Russo expressed
environmentalists' frustration over their bid to save the tree, which
has come to symbolize their campaign to preserve more of the natural
landscape in an area exploding with development.</TE>
<TE>   "What I would like to know is at what point did we get the [nerve]
to be able to cut down a 400-year-old oak tree?" Russo said. "The
whole thing is insane."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than felling or moving the tree, activists said they would
prefer the tree remain where it is and that a park be constructed
around it. They said the adjacent Pico Canyon Road should remain two
lanes, instead of being expanded to four.</TE>
<TE>   "This road has incredible impacts," said Lynne Plambeck, president
of Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment, a sponsor
of Quigley's treetop sit-in. "I'm hopeful we got the point across."</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich did not meet with demonstrators Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But Tony Bell, a spokesman for the supervisor, said any plan to
keep the tree in place would result in "an unsafe road and a dead oak
tree." He said moving the tree would result in a safer road,
equestrian trails and bike lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Recent calls to the supervisor's office from local residents
support moving the tree, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Originally, the calls we were getting were from people saying,
'Save the oak.' Now, they've been calling for roads and schools,"
Bell said. "We're confident we can relocate it and have a thriving
oak tree and a road that serves the needs of the community."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the discovery of several small bones under the tree
last week led to speculation that the site may have been a Native
American burial ground. The bones were examined and "found to be
clearly non-human," said David Campbell, spokesman for the Los
Angeles County coroner's office. The bones have since been
incinerated, Campbell said.</TE>

for 11 new officers.</LD>
<LD>   The new officers, as well as an unspecified number of support

$700,000 annually, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez said the extra officers will help cut response times and
decrease the number of calls each officer handles per shift.</LD>
<TE>   "This will allow our officers to be proactive instead of
reactive," Lopez said. "It will help them become more involved in

<LD>   The city's accomplishment was announced Wednesday. Anaheim was
also cited for, among other things, its successful implementation of
"several waste reduction and recycling programs that effectively
boost its landfill diversion rate." The board singled out the city's
efforts to reduce waste from hotels and Disneyland.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the board announced that several other cities,
including Tustin, had requested and been granted extensions for
complying with the law.</LD>
<TE>   The law was designed to reduce the waste that goes to landfills,
particularly by encouraging recycling. Tustin, which has so far
reduced its waste by 35%, will have until Dec. 31, 2003, to increase
that to 50%, the board said.</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Wilderness Protections</HD>
<DH>President is expected to sign measure affecting land near
Big Sur.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate approved legislation Wednesday to protect as wilderness
nearly 55,000 acres of land around the Big Sur coast and in Pinnacles
National Monument.</LD>
<LD>   "This development is an important first step in our effort to
protect the most important and endangered wild areas in California,"
said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).</LD>
<LD>   The measure was passed by the House earlier this week and now goes
to the White House, where environmentalists expect President Bush to
sign it.</LD>
<TE>   The largest collection of new wilderness would be 34,840 acres in
the Ventana Wilderness area of Los Padres National Forest. Steep
canyons in this area provide a vital habitat for endangered condors.
Stands of old-growth redwoods stretch skyward, and several creeks and
rivers provide spawning ground for endangered steelhead.</TE>
<TE>   The second-largest wilderness addition would be 17,055 acres in
the Silver Peak Wilderness of Los Padres National Forest, close to
the tiny town of Plaskett. Golden eagles soar over the deep canyons
forested with virgin redwoods. The crest of the Santa Lucia Mountains
in this area provides sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Both additions bolster a treasured stronghold of wilderness in an
increasingly urban area.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another jewel in the crown of Big Sur," said Rep. Sam
Farr (D-Carmel), who sponsored the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   It also includes 2,715 acres in Pinnacles National Monument, a
spectacular landscape of rock monoliths, spires and sheer-walled
cliffs that rises out of the Gabilan Mountains east of central
California's Salinas Valley. The area is popular with hikers and rock
climbers.</TE>
<TE>   The bill covers a small portion of the 2.5 million acres of public
land in 81 areas of the state that Boxer has asked Congress to
protect as wilderness. But the senator's spokesman, David Sandretti,
said Farr's more limited legislation turned out to be all that could
realistically be accomplished this year.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1964, Congress has been designating areas such as these,
which are largely untouched by human activities, as wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to preserve them by permanently prohibiting drilling
for oil and gas, logging, mechanized forms of transportation and
development, including roads.</TE>
<TE>   As a rule, there is little interference with nature in such areas.</TE>
<TE>   Hiking, primitive camping, cross-country skiing, non-motorized
boating and sometimes horseback riding are the principal recreational
activities.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the relatively modest acreage, environmentalists were
delighted by the passage of the legislation, one of the few positive
environmental measures to pass Congress this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the 18th time that Congress has designated wilderness in the
state," said Jay Watson, the California representative for the
Wilderness Society, a national environmental group. "It continues a
long tradition of wilderness in California."</TE>
<TE>   All the news was not good for environmentalists from the Senate's
flurry of legislative actions Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate also approved two controversial land exchanges in
Alaska. One would give the University of Alaska 750,000 acres of
federal land for development.</TE>
<TE>   The other would hand over 12,000 acres of temperate rain forest in
the Tongass National Forest to two corporations for logging, mining
and other development.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, the federal government will receive 3,000 acres,
largely already clear-cut lands. That measure now goes to the House
for approval.</TE>

<HD>State Secretly Taped Talks in D.A. Office</HD>
<DH>Covert work by an aide to O.C.'s Rackauckas is likely to
further strain relations with Lockyer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state attorney general's office directed a top assistant of
Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas to secretly record
conversations with fellow employees as part of an investigation of
the district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas has learned of the covert taping and is trying to
question Michael Clesceri, his assistant chief of investigations,
about the work he did as an operative for the state attorney
general's office, according to a letter Clesceri's lawyer sent to the
district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   The request is setting up a clash between Rackauckas and the
attorney general's office, which has instructed Clesceri not to
answer questions about the operation, Clesceri's attorney wrote in
his Nov. 13 letter.</LD>
<TE>   The attorney general assisted the Orange County Grand Jury during
a lengthy investigation of Rackauckas' office that led to a report
this summer that accused the district attorney of misusing office
resources and interfering in cases to benefit political supporters.
The attorney general did not file any criminal charges, however.</TE>
<TE>   The letter does not identify whom Clesceri recorded during his
undercover work, when the work was done or how the evidence was used.</TE>
<TE>   But the specter of a law enforcement agency using secret recording
devices to gather evidence about another law enforcement agency is
highly unusual and likely to further strain the already tense
relationship between Rackauckas and Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, who has
criticized the district attorney's conduct in office.</TE>
<TE>   "What it sounds like is an extreme form of an internal
investigation of the D.A.'s office, but it's about as extreme a form
of an internal investigation as you can imagine," said Laurie
Levenson, a former federal prosecutor now teaching at Loyola Law
School in Los Angeles. "I think it will send chills down the backs of
prosecutors, wondering who are the good guys and who are the bad
guys?"</TE>
<TE>   USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky said he knows of no similar
investigation of a California prosecutor's office.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing is just extraordinary ... like the plot of a bad
movie or something," Chemerinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Clesceri, Rackauckas nor a spokesman for Lockyer would
discuss the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Clesceri, who also is a Fullerton city councilman, has been on
medical leave with an undisclosed ailment from the district
attorney's office since May. His attorney, Michael Stone, wrote the
office to request that Clesceri not be forced to sit through an
internal interview with his boss, Donald Blankenship, about his work
for the attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   Stone wrote that Clesceri's medical condition would make him
unavailable for the interview. He also said he believes Clesceri has
been placed in an "impossible" situation, ordered by his boss to
explain his role in the criminal investigation and instructed by the
attorney general to remain silent.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly ... this is a nightmarish situation," Stone wrote. "That
is, no matter which way my client turns, he runs afoul of the
attorney general or the district attorney."</TE>
<TE>   Clesceri, 37, a police officer for nearly 20 years, was working as
a Tustin police sergeant when Rackauckas hired him as a supervisor in
his 200-member investigations bureau in 1999. At the district
attorney's office, Clesceri helped organize a regional gang
enforcement team.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation of the district attorney's office resulted in a
grand jury report that faulted Rackauckas and his administration for
several alleged improprieties, including sending an investigator in a
county car to conduct surveillance on Rackauckas' adult son in
Riverside County and using his position to hire friends and relatives
of political supporters.</TE>
<TE>   The report also noted that Rackauckas personally intervened in
some cases on behalf of campaign contributors. In one instance,
Rackauckas ordered his investigators to stop an inquiry into a
friend, businessman Patrick Di Carlo.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas filed a lengthy response to the grand jury's report,
explaining that he handled the cases properly and did not misuse
resources. He said the grand jury had been unduly influenced by
political enemies.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Lockyer said he did not believe Rackauckas committed
any crimes, bringing an apparent end to the attorney general's
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   But Lockyer's chief spokesman, Nathan Barankin, took a step back
from those comments this week and said Lockyer does not believe
anything in the grand jury report amounted to criminal conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer sent Rackauckas a letter in October criticizing him for
not taking the grand jury report seriously. Also last month, Orange
County's auditor opened an examination into the use of a special fund
by Rackauckas' chief investigator -- another issue raised by the
grand jury and attorney general. The investigator improperly used the
fund to pay for meals and alcohol consumed during meetings with
lawmakers and lobbyists, according to the grand jury report.</TE>
<TE>   Now the secret recordings may have even more far-reaching
implications for the Orange County justice system, Levenson said.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is once this comes out, every defense attorney in Orange
County is going to want a copy of the taping," she said, so they can
determine whether any of the information can be used to help their
cases.</TE>

advocate for workers for 28 years.</LD>
<LD>   Governing board members voted by a two-thirds majority to dismiss
Hammitt during a tumultuous five-hour meeting late Tuesday, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   A motion to fire the 58-year-old Hammitt came up abruptly after a
lengthy discussion of "ongoing internal problems" that have caused
friction within the union for months, said Keith Filegar, spokesman
for Service Employees International Union, Local 998.</LD>
<TE>   The union represents 6,500 workers employed by county government,
South Coast Area Transit and the cities of Simi Valley, Thousand
Oaks, Moorpark, Oxnard, Ventura, Santa Paula and Port Hueneme.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the motion was made, there wasn't a lot of discussion,"
Filegar said, declining to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Hammitt, reached at home Wednesday, said he is considering
contesting the board's action on the grounds, he said, the board did
not follow proper procedures. His $112,000 annual contract allows for
disputes to be settled by binding arbitration, Hammitt said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Hammitt, one of the major differences centered on his
desire to increase the union's clout by expanding its dues-paying
membership. The union collects $32.50 each month from members'
paychecks, and some members had voiced discontent over recent
increases, Hammitt said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have large numbers of members to drive a program," he
said. "They wanted to charge the least amount of money you have to
pay. There is always that struggle."</TE>
<TE>   Hammitt acknowledged his sometimes-arrogant personal style may
have alienated newer board members who are not familiar with him.
"I'm not a person who puts up with a lot of nonsense," he said.
"Maybe I wore out my welcome."</TE>
<TE>   Over three decades, Hammitt has occasionally faced challenges to
his leadership but was always able to fend them off.</TE>
<TE>   In March, however, it became clear his power was slipping when the
governing board fell two votes short of removing him. At that time,
dissenting union members laid out their list of concerns and asked
Hammitt to respond, Filegar said.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't feel we were making progress," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hammitt joined the union local in 1974, when membership was less
than 2,000. At that time maternity benefits were not included in
county government's health plan, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years he has won a number of concessions for county
workers, including fully paid health insurance benefits, coverage for
domestic partners, binding arbitration rights and textbook and
tuition programs.</TE>
<TE>   He led county government employees through a six-day strike last
year in an effort to win retroactive pension increases. Although that
effort failed, the county agreed to add a 2% cost-of-living
adjustment to pension checks beginning last July. And the 4,200
librarians, social workers, accountants and clerks who make up the
union won raises averaging 13% over four years. But many workers were
bitter they were unable to secure the retroactive pension increases.</TE>
<TE>   John Flynn, chairman of the Ventura County Board of Supervisors,
said he was shocked by the firing.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry is a very professional labor leader. He has done a very
good job," Flynn said. "I didn't expect it to come to this."</TE>

<HD>Brush Fire Nears 30 Yorba Linda Homes</HD>
<DH>Blaze began near Chino Hills State Park. The cause was
under investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane and Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fast-moving, erratic brush fire, fueled by hot, dry weather and
driven by gusty winds, was threatening as many as 30 hillside homes
in Yorba Linda late Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks like it's moving at a pretty good clip," said Dennis
Shell, a spokesman for the Orange County Fire Authority, which by 10
p.m. had more than 100 firefighters on scene, along with strike teams
from Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   One firefighter -- a woman working as part of a reserve crew
cutting brush by hand on a hillside -- had to be airlifted to a
hospital for treatment of "medical complications, possibly
overexertion or dehydration," said Capt. Steve Miller of the fire
authority. Her condition was stable, he said.</LD>
<TE>   According to Shell, the fire started about 7:30 p.m. on Yorba
Linda's Blue Gum Drive near Chino Hills State Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got fire investigators on scene right now [to determine the
cause]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fanned by gusty winds of 25 to 35 mph and fueled by temperatures
of more than 80 degrees, the fire spread quickly west through about
50 acres of waist-high brush and "flashy, grassy fuels," Shell said.</TE>
<TE>   Though moving generally away from populated areas, the 25- to
30-foot flames at times came to within a few hundred yards of some
homes as the wind shifted.</TE>
<TE>   "With these gusty winds it's very erratic and unpredictable,"
Shell said. By 10 p.m., the fire was about 40% contained. "If the
winds give us a break I think we're OK," he said. "We're making some
good headway -- it's starting to look like [conditions] are becoming
favorable."</TE>
<TE>   He said dozens of firefighters were deployed in residential areas
with hoses at the ready. "They're talking to residents, keeping them
calm and prepared to immediately put down any flare-ups," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts were aided, Shell said, by the residents, who seemed
well-prepared for the annual fire season, which has been prolonged
this year by drought-like conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "The community has done an excellent job of brush clearance and
has some excellent greenbelts around their homes," he said. "From
what we can see, there are many noncombustible roofs in the area,
which is a good help."</TE>
<TE>   Some power lines were reported down, Shell said, possibly causing
interruptions in service. Edison crews were on hand late into the
night making repairs</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Merriday, 14, said she reported the fire to authorities
after being alerted to it by the barking of her golden retriever. The
fire, said her mother, Celia, was "in a perfect circle" about a block
away from their house when they called 911. Two hours later, about
three dozen residents stood in the streets watching the flames,
though none seemed overly alarmed.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on Blue Gum Drive, however, the residents of at least
three homes had been told early in the evening to pack up their
belongings and prepare to obey an evacuation order that never came.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the charm of living up here is being away from
everything," said Jessica Stout, 28, adding that she had personally
alerted half a dozen neighbors to the danger. "But it also means that
we're surrounded by brush.</TE>
<TE>   "We still won't be sleeping very well tonight," she added, "but
the wind has been in our favor the whole time, thank God."</TE>
<TE>   Bulldozers prepared emergency firebreaks along ridge tops to keep
the fire well away from the homes. Connie Martinez, 42, a resident
for 16 years, said the area had been the scene of brush fires at
least three times before, most recently in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "You never have enough time to prepare," said Martinez, vice
president of a mortgage company in Santa Ana. Nonetheless, she said,
she had stuffed a gym bag full of various belongings, including a
change of clothes, tennis shoes and personal photographs in case she
has to flee. "The first night you [always] sleep uneasy, but I've
gotten used to it," she said. "I've already called my boss and told
them I'm coming in late tomorrow, but if the wind shifts I won't be
coming in at all."</TE>

<HD>Drug Dealer Is Convicted in Ventura Clerk's Slaying</HD>
<DH>Richard Geise, found guilty of first-degree murder, faces a
life sentence. It's his second trial in the fatal shooting at the
market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson and Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After six days of deliberation, a Ventura County jury Wednesday found
a 33-year-old drug dealer guilty of murder in the fatal shooting of a
Ventura Avenue market clerk during a botched robbery last year.</LD>
<LD>   Former Ojai resident Richard John Geise faces life in prison
without the possibility of parole after being convicted of
first-degree murder and of five lesser charges.</LD>
<LD>   Although the jury returned a guilty verdict on the most serious
charge, the panel deadlocked on two counts of attempted murder and
one count of commercial burglary.</LD>
<TE>   The verdict puzzled lawyers, who struggled to explain under what
theory the jury found Geise responsible for the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what they decided was he was part of the conspiracy to
commit robbery, but was not present at the scene," said Senior Deputy
Dist. Atty. Don Glynn. "Same result."</TE>
<TE>   Attorney John McNamara, who appeared in court with Geise after
trial lawyer Robert Schwartz left town because of a family emergency,
declined to speculate on the jurors' reasoning.</TE>
<TE>   "It did seem like some of the verdicts were inconsistent with each
other," McNamara said. "There will be a motion for a new trial and an
appeal."</TE>
<TE>   After the verdicts were announced in Ventura County Superior
Court, jurors and relatives of the defendant and of slain grocery
clerk Primitivo Alvarez immediately left the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez's mother, Concepcion Alvarez, left the courtroom in tears
while walking with her other son, Omar Alvarez.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was the second for Geise on the same charges.</TE>
<TE>   On April 22, a mistrial was declared on the day of closing
arguments when Geise's then-attorney said he could not ethically
proceed because he had received evidence showing his client may have
caused a witness to lie on the stand.</TE>
<TE>   Geise's new trial began Oct. 31.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, two men wearing gas masks entered the
family-owned Central Market in Ventura on April 6, 2001, and ordered
clerks to open the store's safe.</TE>
<TE>   Before the employees could comply, the gunmen opened fire, police
said. Alvarez, 35, was killed and brothers Balbir and Mohan Singh
were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The other suspected gunman in the heist, Alfonso Acosta Delgado
Jr., 25, was killed in May 2001 by a Ventura police SWAT team
marksman after a five-hour standoff outside his grandmother's house.</TE>
<TE>   Geise, a five-time felon with a lengthy history of drug offenses,
had maintained since his arrest that he was with his family at the
time of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   He testified that a few hours after the shooting, Delgado, who was
his cousin, and another man, Sam Patterson, visited him at a motel on
Seaward Avenue in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Geise said the men wanted him to help them make false
identification cards, which he did. Geise also testified that the men
then told him they had robbed the market earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson died from a drug overdose last year.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argued at both trials that Geise is a habitual liar,
who first told police he had gone to Magic Mountain with his family
the day of the robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Police reported finding drugs and a computer used to make fake
identification cards in Geise's motel room. A .40-caliber
semiautomatic handgun was found hidden in the ceiling above a closet.
Lab tests revealed the gun was one of two weapons fired during the
shooting, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, defense attorney Schwartz cited testimony from two
witnesses who identified another man as the possible killer. During
both trials, Geise's estranged wife provided him an alibi.</TE>

<HD>Authorities' Catch of the Day</HD>
<DH>Fish and Game officials arrest two men who they say caught
110 lobsters off Dana Point that were too small to be kept legally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The game wardens watched the two fishermen for hours as they plucked
one lobster after another from the traps and tossed them into their
boat bobbing off the coast of Dana Point.</LD>
<LD>   When confronted back at port, state Fish and Game agents said, the
fishermen told them not to bother measuring their catch because the
men knew the 100 or so lobsters they snared were too small.</LD>
<LD>   For those who patrol the waters for lobster rustlers, Monday's
bust was significant.</LD>
<TE>   The seizure was one of the largest in a decade in Southern
California and underscored the importance Fish and Game officials put
on protecting the native crustacean, whose numbers dropped sharply in
the 1970s when poaching was at a peak.</TE>
<TE>   The case was also unusual because the skipper of the boat has a
lobster permit, making him one of only 225 fishermen in the state
granted the lifelong right to harvest legal-size lobsters. Over the
years, as the lobster population slowly climbed, poachers--not the
licensed lobster fishermen--have been viewed as the leading threat to
the California spiny lobster.</TE>
<TE>   "This was shocking," Fish and Game Lt. Chris Graff said. "Usually
we get poachers who have no licenses of any kind, and here the guy's
a commercial fisherman. If he wanted to plan any kind of career in
fishing, he just shot himself in the foot."</TE>
<TE>   If found guilty, Harvey Gonzalez, 22, of San Juan Capistrano and
his crew member, Roddy Giacomini, 25, of Vista, could each face a
maximum $110,000 fine, prison time, the loss of their commercial
fishing and lobster permits and the seizure of their boat.</TE>
<TE>   Neither could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the men were caught with 110 baby lobsters, all
too small for legal harvesting.</TE>
<TE>   The estimated value of the catch was roughly $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   California lobsters sell for as much as $12 a pound.</TE>
<TE>   Game wardens said the fishermen told them they did not intend to
sell the lobsters on the black market.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Game agents periodically check restaurants and fish
markets, making sure the lobsters are of a legal size.</TE>
<TE>   More often, game wardens concentrate on commercial fishing vessels
such as gill netters and hook-and-line fishermen, not those working
the lobster pots.</TE>
<TE>   But in this case, the wardens had received a tip and had had the
two men under surveillance for days.</TE>
<TE>   Wardens watched them from the deck of the Thresher, one of three
Fish and Game boats patrolling the ocean from the Mexican border to
Ventura to 200 miles offshore, Graff said.</TE>
<TE>   As a rule, officials said, licensed lobster fishermen toss back
about five short lobsters for every legal one they keep. But as the
warden watched the two men Monday, they threw back only five lobsters
during their lengthy fishing session, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   After hauling in the last trap, Gonzalez allegedly maneuvered his
boat quickly back to dock where the catch was shifted to a car. The
men were stopped leaving the dock by game wardens, who said that of
the 116 lobsters stowed in the car, only six were of legal size. Of
the seized lobsters, authorities said, all but four -- kept for
evidence -- were returned to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   When word spread of the alleged illegal catch, it angered other
lobster fishermen who make their livelihood pulling up hundreds of
traps during a season that lasts from the first week in October until
March 15.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they lose their permit," said John Guth, president of the
California Lobster and Trap Fishermen's Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Rainforth, one of the few women in the state licensed to
hunt for lobster, said the incident angered her.</TE>
<TE>   Lobster harvesting has been slow lately, she said. On Wednesday,
for instance, out of 80 lobster traps she tends off the San Onofre
nuclear power plant, she pulled in 30 lobsters, not enough to warrant
meeting up with a buyer.</TE>
<TE>   Lobster fishermen say they average about $60,000 during the
six-month season. In good years, when large storms stir up the
bottom, they can earn $90,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   But lately the weather has been mild and the lobster fishing has
been slow, said Mark Larkins, another fisherman at Dana Point.</TE>
<TE>   To be legal, lobsters must measure at least 3 1/4 inches from the
eye socket to the rear edge of their shell. It takes seven to 11
years for lobsters to reach legal size.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't the first arrest of the lobster season. A diver who
was apprehended a month ago near Crystal Cove. He was caught with
about 40 lobsters he had poached from commercial lobster traps.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, lobsters were on the decline, but the state adopted
regulations requiring fishermen to install escape ports in traps so
undersized lobsters could escape before traps were pulled. It helped
reverse the trend and now annual lobster catches have grown from a
low of 200,000 pounds to an average of 400,000 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial fishermen enter a lottery to get a lobster permit. But
once issued, "it's for life," Graff said, "that is until the
fisherman dies or quits the business," or has it stripped for
violations.</TE>

<LD>Nearly 1.5 million poor families in California do not have access to
lawyers when they confront disputes involving education, employment,
health care or other needs, according to a report issued Wednesday by
a special state bar commission.</LD>
<LD>   The state has increased its spending on legal services for the
poor in recent years. But it still spends considerably less than
several other major industrial states and has many fewer lawyers
available to serve the poor.</LD>
<LD>   California has one lawyer available for every 10,000 poor
residents, and spends $13 per eligible person for civil legal
services.</LD>
<TE>   By contrast, Minnesota and New Jersey provide $39 per person.
Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Washington, Ohio and
Pennsylvania are among the states that also outspend California.</TE>
<TE>   Total public and private expenditures for civil legal services for
California's poor come to $149 million, a significant hike from the
1996 level of $101 million. But completely meeting the need for legal
representation among poor people would require $533 million, said San
Francisco attorney Jack Londen, past chair of the California
Commission on Access to Justice, which issued the report.</TE>
<TE>   "As a practical matter, there can be no access to justice without
access to legal assistance," Londen said.</TE>
<TE>   The commission was created in 1997 after a State Bar task force
issued a study that said the quality of justice in the state was
being seriously undermined by inadequate efforts to address the legal
needs of the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "The statistics may seem cold, but it's impossible to remain
complacent about this situation after meeting a family made homeless
by an illegal eviction, a senior who lost his home to foreclosure
from a crooked loan transaction or a domestic violence victim unable
to navigate the courts to get a restraining order," said Karen A.
Lash, associate dean at USC Law School who co-chairs the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Legal Aid lawyers also provide assistance to children with
disabilities who are denied proper care, veterans seeking government
benefits and elderly individuals claiming abuse by their caregivers.</TE>
<TE>   The latest census figures show that from 1990 to 2000, the number
of Californians living at or below the poverty line grew by nearly
1.1 million -- a 30% increase in the potential caseload for Legal Aid
lawyers, the report found.</TE>
<TE>   And the problem may get worse, the report noted. Although
California has 12% of the national population, the state accounted
for 55% of the growth in poor people across the country between 1990
and 2000, census figures show.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the clients served by Legal Aid lawyers now have jobs -- a
notable change from the situation a couple of decades ago, said Bruce
Iwasaki, executive director of the Legal Aid Foundation. He noted
that 46% of poor families in California have at least one full-time
worker.</TE>
<TE>   The report found that there have been some improvements in the
past five years. In 1999, for the first time, California specifically
allotted $10 million for civil legal services for the poor. The money
was an attempt to compensate for reduced federal spending on Legal
Aid.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, legal self-help centers have been created in every
county. And the state has developed a more cost-effective way of
delivering legal services "through cutting-edge computer and Internet
technology," the report states.</TE>
<TE>   "California has come a long way, but we still have a long way to
go," said Chief Justice Ronald M. George, who has made improvement of
legal services for California's 6 million poor people a priority.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview this week, George said he took heart from the fact
that Gov. Gray Davis had initially agreed to increase the state's
Access to Justice fund from $10 million to $15 million in the next
budget. "But when the economy tanked, it went back to $10 million.
Just to maintain it at that level in this economy is an achievement,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   George said the need for lawyers for the poor is particularly
acute in the family law area -- adoptions, divorces, child custody
disputes and domestic violence cases.</TE>
<TE>   "In some areas of the state, both sides have no lawyers in
two-thirds of such cases," he said. In other parts of the state, 90%
of the cases have a lawyer on only one side, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The state's self-help Web site "is extremely valuable," but in
many situations it simply cannot replace an attorney, he said.</TE>
<TE>   George has been pressing corporate lawyers to do more free legal
work to fill the gaps. At the annual State Bar convention, he
presents awards to private lawyers who have provided particularly
effective, free assistance to poor people. One Saturday in Los
Angeles, George conducted 10 adoption hearings as part of a pro bono
program organized by Los Angeles law firms.</TE>
<TE>   Another jurist who has been outspoken on the issue is Justice Earl
Johnson, who sits on the State Court of Appeal in Los Angeles and
co-chaired the commission with Lash. "I know my fellow judges want to
do justice and not inflict injustice," Johnson said. But he added,
"They know it can be nearly impossible to do the former and avoid the
latter in a one-sided contest where only one litigant has a lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   While the state has made improvements, the unmet need remains
large, said Londen, whose firm, Morrison &amp; Foerster, has a reputation
for providing free legal services to poor people.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a glass-half-full situation."</TE>

<HD>Support Grows for Replacing Parker Center</HD>
<DH>New LAPD headquarters is needed, council members say.
Paying for it will be a challenge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City Council members Wednesday launched a review of a proposal to
replace the LAPD's aging headquarters amid agreement that conditions
at Parker Center are deplorable and uncertainty about where the city
will get the money.</LD>
<LD>   Council members took the action a day after Police Commission
President Rick Caruso said he will report to the commission next week
on the availability of downtown office space that can be leased for
police operations so Parker Center can be demolished and rebuilt.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not safe for humans. It's in shambles," said Councilman
Dennis Zine, a former police sergeant.</LD>
<TE>   Zine joined council members Cindy Miscikowski, Nick Pacheco and
Mark Ridley-Thomas in introducing a motion calling for a report to
the council to "identify appropriate space to relocate employees
[from] Parker Center in the near term" and come up with "permanent
solutions" to house LAPD headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "The facility, while state-of-the-art when built, is now obsolete
and is not adequate to house the Los Angeles Police Department
headquarters," said the motion, written by Miscikowski, head of the
council's Public Safety Committee. The council will vote on the
motion next week.</TE>
<TE>   All 10 council members interviewed Wednesday said they support the
goal of replacing Parker Center, which opened in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   The council members asked the Municipal Facilities Committee,
which includes representatives of the mayor and chief legislative
analyst, to produce the report.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn, who is in Asia this week, supports efforts to
replace the building, a spokesman said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We agree that Parker Center has outlived its useful life for the
city, and we are beginning to look at options," Deputy Mayor Matt
Middlebrook said.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas also said he plans to raise the issue next week at a
meeting of a council panel that oversees city facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Officers working at police headquarters have long complained about
leaky pipes, paper-thin walls, dangling cables and sagging floors.</TE>
<TE>   And while all council members interviewed agreed that conditions
are not good at Parker Center, many said it may be difficult to find
money for a replacement. Voters turned down a bond measure in 1999
that would have provided $67 million to build a new police
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to support our LAPD and ensure they have appropriate
offices," Councilwoman Wendy Greuel said.</TE>
<TE>   But she and other council members warned that in the face of many
pressing law enforcement needs, the city will have to make tough
choices.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said the council may have to choose between hiring more
officers and paying for a new building, while Councilman Jack Weiss
said anti-terrorism measures and community-based policing must remain
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton said one option may be to go
back to voters to seek $150 million to $200 million for a new police
headquarters. Councilman Hal Bernson said the problems with Parker
Center should have been addressed after the building was damaged in
the 1994 Northridge earthquake. At that time the city had federal
relief money to rebuild damaged city buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we made a big mistake after the earthquake in not doing
some of the things that should have been done then," Bernson said.
"We can't afford it now, but we could have then."</TE>
<TE>   Since a consultant recommended in 1996 that Parker Center be
demolished, officials have been looking at options including buying
or leasing a new building, or buying an older building. Either
scenario is costly, given that the police have special requirements
for security.</TE>
<TE>   Councilmen Tom LaBonge and Zine said the city might want to
disperse some functions in Parker Center as part of the move to
decentralize city government. That way, any new police headquarters
need not be as large and expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Zine said functions including records and jail facilities might be
better moved out of any headquarters, while specialized
crime-fighting units also could be located elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a need for a central police headquarters, but if there
is a benefit with this situation to put some units outside focused on
the community, I want to do that," LaBonge said.</TE>
<TE>   However, LaBonge and Zine are concerned that various city
departments are already spending approximately $30 million annually
to lease space in private buildings for city offices.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, the pair introduced a motion Wednesday calling
for a report on all existing leases with an eye toward saving money
by better using city buildings and possibly purchasing rather than
leasing structures in the future. That motion also will be taken up
next week.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to consolidate and save dollars," Zine said, adding that
savings could help solve the problem of Parker Center.</TE>

<HD>Risks to Pedestrians on the Rise, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Study raises concerns about pedestrian safety in the state.
Officials say it's a high priority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pedestrian deaths in California rose 6% last year, and the state
again led the nation in total pedestrian fatalities, according to a
national study to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   Last year 731 pedestrians were killed on the streets of
California, the nation's most populous state. That's up from 691 in
2000, says the study by the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a
national nonprofit group that promotes pedestrian and bicycle safety.</LD>
<LD>   Within the state, Southern California led all regions in
pedestrian fatalities with 389 deaths in 2001, up from 354 in the
previous year, according to the "Mean Streets 2002" study.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the report ranked Merced County as the most dangerous
metropolitan area in the state based on a "pedestrian danger index"
that takes into consideration the number of deaths per capita and the
percentage of people who walk to work.</TE>
<TE>   Measured by that index, the Southern California area, which
includes Los Angeles, Ventura, Riverside, Orange and San Bernardino
counties, was ranked the seventh most dangerous region in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Together, the Southern California counties annually spend 25 cents
per person in federal funds on pedestrian and bicycle projects,
compared to 52 cents per person statewide, the study found.
Nationwide, the federal government annually spends 87 cents per
person on pedestrian and bicycle projects.</TE>
<TE>   The study did not calculate state and local funds spent on
pedestrian projects.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, despite the pleas of mayors and local elected
officials, few federal transportation dollars are being spent on
pedestrian safety in most of these areas," the study says.</TE>
<TE>   The report also identified the 10 streets in America with the
greatest number of pedestrian deaths in 2000 and 2001. The top three
streets in that category are in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The street with the most deaths in California, the study says, is
Foothill Boulevard in San Bernardino, which had 10 pedestrian
fatalities in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that the streets with the most pedestrian deaths
are high-speed arterial routes that have few pedestrian
accommodations, such as crosswalks or footbridges.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the report, state and local officials insisted that
they have recently made pedestrian safety a priority.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the California Department of Transportation noted
that the governor recently approved $30 million for 110 grants to
build pedestrian and bicycle projects statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not chump change," said Caltrans spokesman John Robin
Witt.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the
transit planning agency for Los Angeles County, said the MTA has
increased pedestrian spending in the county from half a million
dollars in 1992 to $10 million in the current spending plan.</TE>
<TE>   Hasan Ikhrata, director of planning and policy for the Southern
California Assn. of Governments, said his group also has made
pedestrian safety a priority in transportation planning.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the level of funding for pedestrian projects is still
woefully low.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason," he said, "pedestrian safety is not sexy enough
for politicians to champion."</TE>

<HD>School Called 'Out of Control'</HD>
<DH>Teachers and students at Washington Prep High describe
crime, sex acts, drug use on campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joe Mathews, Erika Hayasaki and Duke Helfand</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Students and teachers on Wednesday described Washington Prep High
School as a place where youngsters are regularly beaten and robbed,
students have sex and use drugs in corridors, and pleas for
discipline go unheeded by administrators.</LD>
<LD>   The problems have escalated at the campus to the point that
teachers filed a written complaint to their union earlier this month
that the school east of Hollywood Park is "OUT OF CONTROL." In
response, district Supt. Roy Romer vowed Wednesday to restore order
within 30 days. He and his staff pledged to beef up security and
increase the number of parent volunteers to monitor hallways and
bathrooms.</LD>
<LD>   "There are serious challenges. We need to change the atmosphere
fairly quickly," Romer said. "We're simply not going to tolerate
conditions in which we are not making improvement."</LD>
<TE>   Washington Prep, like a handful of other troubled high schools in
Los Angeles, has struggled for years to maintain order and more
recently to improve its test scores, which are among the lowest in
the state. District officials appointed a new principal two years
ago, and although he is credited with improving achievement, he has
fallen short on matters of discipline, Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents said Wednesday that they fear for their children's
safety.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell my daughter ... 'Protect yourself however you can. Pack a
knife if you have to,' " said Patricia Pruitt, whose 14-year-old
daughter is a freshman. "I've visited the school and I've seen fights
and people smoking weed on the second floor."</TE>
<TE>   Several students said they avoid parts of campus -- especially
upper floor corridors -- for fear they will encounter their peers
using drugs or engaging in sex.</TE>
<TE>   One third-floor alcove has become notorious for illicit activity
because its doors can be locked from the inside on either end,
students said.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what you're going to see on the third floor," said
Brandi Welch, the student body vice president whose Advance Placement
psychology class is on that floor. "I didn't know what marijuana
smelled like until I came to Washington."</TE>
<TE>   Principal James Noble on Wednesday acknowledged some of the
misbehavior.</TE>
<TE>   "Students have been caught having sex from time to time, not just
on the third floor but in other places," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After teachers' concerns surfaced, Noble met at the school Tuesday
night with about 300 parents to discuss the problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I fear for their safety," said Jaffar Smith-El, whose 16-year-old
daughter attends Washington. "It's getting worse."</TE>
<TE>   Washington sits in one of Los Angeles Unified's poorest
communities, midway between Watts and Inglewood's Hollywood Park.
Nearly two-thirds of its 3,000 students qualify for subsidized
lunches.</TE>
<TE>   It is also one of L.A. Unified's lowest performing campuses
academically. Although its test scores improved last year, the school
still ranks in the lowest band of schools on the state's
accountability system.</TE>
<TE>   The disorder on campus is reflected in its suspension rate, one of
the highest in L.A. Unified: Thirty-five percent of its students were
suspended in the 2000-01 school year, compared with 13% for high
schools districtwide. Washington is among a small group of Los
Angeles high schools that have struggled with discipline and
academics, and where district officials have pledged in recent years
to make changes.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two years, the district has replaced the principals
at Washington and several of its neighbors, including Locke High,
Manual Arts, Fremont, Dorsey and Crenshaw high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Two of these campuses -- Fremont and Locke -- have faced extensive
scrutiny and media coverage. They also have seen dramatic
improvements after the district replaced administrators, stepped up
discipline and introduced other measures to improve atmosphere.
Officials hope to duplicate that success at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "We are really working at trying to change these schools," Romer
said. "It is not easy."</TE>
<TE>   Even as they acknowledged Washington's many problems, Romer and
others said it is unfair to hold the school responsible for crime and
other difficulties that spill from the community onto campus.</TE>
<TE>   Noble, the principal, said that seven gangs operate in the
immediate area and that rivalries have intensified lately. He said
that some of Washington's most recent troubles reflect this upsurge
in activity.</TE>
<TE>   "The outsider influence has grown," Noble said. "We have people
hopping the fence and coming in. There are a number of individuals
who don't belong on this campus."</TE>
<TE>   District officials said that parents themselves bear some
responsibility for failing to ensure that their children arrive at
school ready to learn.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot more complexity to these things than this
knee-jerk reaction to beat up on the principal, the administrators,
the teachers and the school," said Los Angeles school board member
Genethia Hudley Hayes, who represents the area that includes
Washington Prep.</TE>
<TE>   "The community has a piece of this. The students have a piece of
this."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Washington teachers have long complained about unruly
hallways and classroom disruptions, but the problems came to a head
earlier this month when their union, United Teachers-Los Angeles,
received the anonymous letter outlining their concerns. The letter
said that students are robbed and beaten daily, and that the campus
is unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the union sent a letter to the district demanding
increased security and other steps to halt "students roaming in packs
and wreaking havoc" on the campus.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders, who met with teachers at the school Friday, said
they witnessed fighting in the quad after lunch and dozens of
students milling around after the bell had rung. "I saw at least
three fights break out," said union Vice President Bev Cook. "I
didn't think the students or the teachers were safe."</TE>
<TE>   Washington staff members said in interviews Wednesday that the
school lacks the administrative staff to handle discipline problems.
The school's assistant principal in charge of discipline transferred
in September and was replaced only two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like a lawless school," said English teacher Genevieve
Johnson. "Kids feel they can get away with things. There's no real
punishment for students."</TE>
<TE>   Some teachers blame Noble, now in his second year at Washington,
for failing to maintain order. Several depicted him as a nice person
with a soft touch.</TE>
<TE>   Too soft, some students said Wednesday. They complained that Noble
and his staff have not taken their concerns seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "It started to get out of control when Mr. Noble came in last
year," said Marvelette Calbert, 17. "We need much more discipline."</TE>
<TE>   District officials expressed confidence in Noble, saying that he
has improved academics and that he will get help from district
administrators to better oversee school operations.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and students said they only hope that the district's
sudden focus on maintaining order on campus lasts.</TE>
<TE>   "If this school was like this every day," said teachers union
representative Annette Harrison, referring to the large-scale
official presence on campus Wednesday, "we never would have had to
raise the issue."</TE>

<HD>130 Arrested in Sweep of Skid Row</HD>
<DH>Many are parole violators, say police, who add that
homeless were not the target. The operation involves more than 250
officers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein and Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 250 officers moved through downtown Los Angeles' skid row
in raids that began before dawn Wednesday, arresting more than 130
people, including many ex-convicts who had violated parole, Los
Angeles police said.</LD>
<LD>   Some homeless people sleeping outdoors were rousted in the
operation. Police said the move had been planned for two months, but
it came just 48 hours after business organizations complained about
the number of homeless people in the area, saying the concentration
threatened efforts to improve the downtown economy. The number of
arrests quickly overwhelmed the jail facilities at Parker Center, the
LAPD's headquarters, and forced police to use buses as temporary
detention housing.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Chief Jim McDonnell said Wednesday's operation was a
move by Chief William J. Bratton and Mayor James K. Hahn, along with
other agencies, to deal with the soaring number of parole violators
downtown.</LD>
<TE>   The message, said McDonnell, is that violators cannot avoid prison
by living on skid row. "People either behave or go elsewhere," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Police searched the blocks bounded by 1st, Spring and 7th streets
and the Los Angeles River. Many of those detained were arrested on
the streets and in low-cost hotels around 5th Street, an area known
as "the Nickel."</TE>
<TE>   As McDonnell spoke, parolees in handcuffs could be seen being led
into a tented area behind Parker Center, where buses waited to take
them to County Jail facilities for hearings.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials said police did not approach people at random.
Instead, accompanied by parole officers and working with information
about parolees gleaned from several days of surveillance in the area,
they questioned several hundred people Wednesday to determine their
identities and whether they were in violation of their parole terms.</TE>
<TE>   Of those taken into custody, about half were found inside
buildings, while the others were on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% were arrested on suspicion of violating specific
conditions of their parole. Parole conditions often include pledges
by the parolee to live in a certain place or to avoid associating
with certain groups of people, such as gang members or former
associates who have been convicted of crimes.</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of the cases involved parolees found to be in possession
of narcotics or weapons, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Parolee violators can be returned to state prison with just a jail
hearing but no formal court proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "This operation was not aimed at the homeless population; rather
it was aimed at many of those who seek to victimize the homeless,"
said Lt. Horace Frank, an LAPD spokesman. "Those arrested were found
to be in possession of heroin, rock cocaine and other contraband,
including weapons."</TE>
<TE>   "Some homeless were arrested," said LAPD Officer Jack Richter,
"but they fit into specific [criminal] categories."</TE>
<TE>   Scores of officers from the LAPD's Central Bureau worked in
conjunction with the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, state Corrections
and Justice departments, Los Angeles County Probation Department and
California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Southern California, questioned the police tactics. "What
the police are doing here has been tried in other cities and failed,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   But others welcomed the move.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Hayes, executive director of SRO Housing Corp., which operates
22 residential hotels, said that there were no sweeps at his firm's
properties but that he believes the operation was a good idea. "The
elimination of parole violators or predators is essential to making
life better for the homeless and all other stakeholders in downtown,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Warren, vice president for public policy at the Central
Cities Assn., which represents 300 businesses, mostly downtown, also
said that the action will improve safety in the area. She said she
hopes that more foot and bike patrols will follow.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a growing population of people living on the streets,
who are being victimized or [are] part of a criminal element," Warren
said. "LAPD and county enforcement is part of the solution, which
includes getting people off the streets and into shelters."</TE>
<TE>   Officials estimate that 9,000 to 15,000 people live on the streets
of Central Los Angeles -- as many as 3,000 to 5,000 of them on skid
row. The area "has the highest concentration of parolees in the
state, almost 2,000," said Capt. Charles Beck.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has said the concentration of homeless people downtown is
the worst he has seen. He said the LAPD needs to create a
homeless-outreach unit.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the city is trying to attract people to live in
renovated loft buildings downtown.</TE>
<TE>   But McDonnell said the LAPD was simply enforcing the law, not
trying to sweep homeless people out. "The problem in this area is,
parolees haven't been living up to their conditions of parole," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Jury Is Shown 2 Portraits of Vasco</HD>
<DH>She's been painted as victim and schemer. Deliberations in
her murder trial start today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Monte Morin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When jurors begin deliberations today in the murder-for-hire case
involving a slain Huntington Beach doctor and his wife, they will be
forced to reconcile two very different portraits of the defendant,
Adriana Vasco.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout a week of testimony, prosecutors have portrayed the
35-year-old as manipulative and dangerous, a woman who had an affair
with Dr. Kenneth Stahl and then plotted with her other boyfriend to
kill Stahl and his wife, Carolyn Oppy-Stahl -- a woman Vasco referred
to as a "witch."</LD>
<LD>   The defense says Vasco is a weak and emotionally shattered woman
who was dominated and manipulated by Stahl, as well as the accused
triggerman -- who allegedly swaggered around with a shotgun under his
trench coat. Vasco, according to defense lawyer Robert M. Viefhaus,
is a woman incapable of executing such a complicated and ruthless
murder scheme.</LD>
<TE>   But what jurors won't be considering today is perhaps the case's
most intriguing piece of evidence: a confession Vasco allegedly
offered to sheriff's deputies following her arrest.</TE>
<TE>   A previous judge ruled that the confession was inadmissible
because it was coerced and violated Vasco's constitutional rights.
Detectives had manipulated a "vulnerable" woman by playing on her
fears about the safety of her children, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Loss of the confession has complicated the efforts of prosecutors.
The judge who barred the statements expressed doubts later that
prosecutors had enough evidence to convict Vasco. Without the
confession, the prosecution relied on an interview Vasco gave to the
Orange County Register, in which she spoke of her knowledge of the
plot. In the end, however, the case is likely to come down to who the
jury believes Vasco is.</TE>
<TE>   Often during the trial, Vasco has broken into tears when listening
to the details of Kenneth Stahl's and Carolyn Oppy-Stahl's deaths. On
more than one occasion, Judge Francisco Briseno has excused the jury
so that a tearful and shaking Vasco could compose herself during
testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Just such a moment occurred on the last day of testimony
Wednesday, when her lawyer questioned her about Oppy-Stahl's death.
"It's hard to talk about her," Vasco said, wiping tears from her
eyes, her round face framed by long black hair. "I don't like to
think about her because I hurt her."</TE>
<TE>   Vasco's lawyer insists that she suffers from a form of
post-traumatic stress disorder and battered-women's syndrome. Born of
a rape in her native Mexico, Vasco reportedly suffered a string of
abusive relationships and turned to alcohol and drugs for solace,
according to testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say that Vasco, a medical secretary, carried on an
affair of many years with 57-year-old Kenneth Stahl, an
anesthesiologist. They say that Vasco and Stahl shared an extreme
distaste for Oppy-Stahl, 44, and that she helped the doctor find
someone who would kill his wife for $30,000 and she also helped scout
a murder site. When asked by Stahl if she knew anyone who could "take
care of" his wife, Vasco allegedly suggested Dennis Godley, another
boyfriend and a handyman at Vasco's Anaheim apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   Godley will face a murder trial next year in connection with the
case; he has also pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of killing only Kenneth Stahl's wife as the couple sat in
an idling car on Ortega Highway in November 1999, the gunman turned
his .357-caliber magnum on the doctor as well, prosecutors say.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's bullet-riddled bodies were discovered later that
night by a security guard.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the stand in her own defense, Vasco said she was
manipulated into helping Stahl arrange for the killing but insisted
she was in a state of denial.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in a soft voice, Vasco told jurors that Godley threatened
to kill her and harm her children if she ever spoke of the plot.</TE>
<TE>   She said that even though she heard the men discussing the plan on
the telephone and even transferred an envelope of cash from Stahl to
Godley, she denied that the killing would ever occur.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't believe any of this was going to happen," Vasco said.</TE>
<TE>   In a lengthy cross examination Wednesday, Deputy Dist. Atty.
Dennis Conway disputed the notion that she was cowed by Godley and
Stahl. "You're not the type of woman where men can just march into
your life and control you," Conway said.</TE>
<TE>   Vasco denied the characterization but agreed with the prosecutor
on another point.</TE>
<TE>   "If you hadn't introduced Godley to Ken and his wife, they would
still be alive, right?" Conway asked Vasco.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Vasco responded, and broke into tears.</TE>

<HD>Dry Australian Open Greens Too Fast to Play</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>The first round of the Australian Open was suspended today because
the dry greens at Victoria Golf Club were too fast.</LD>
<LD>   Australian Golf Union officials enforced a suspension when players
complained that their balls would not stay on the greens. After
Richard Ball putted past a hole three times, and the ball rolled back
20 feet, his group refused to continue.</LD>
<LD>   Play was halted for more than 40 minutes as ground staff watered
the third, 11th and 14th greens, but the round was postponed. No
scores from the morning session will count.</LD>
<TE>   The first and second rounds were rescheduled for Friday and
Saturday, with 36 holes to be played Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Stuart Appleby, who shot a three-over 73
Thursday, described the greens as "Teflon-coated," "diabolical" and
resembling "five o'clock shadow."</TE>
<TE>   "The people involved need to take responsibility for what's
happened," Appleby said. "They knew the weather....</TE>
<TE>   "They've played with the snake that is Victoria, and they've been
bitten. The problem is, we get the venom."</TE>
<TE>   Rich Beem didn't think adding a little water would help the
greens.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd be better off spitting on them a couple of times," the PGA
champion said.</TE>

<HD>Expos to Call Puerto Rico Home</HD>
<DH>Montreal to play 22 games on island, including three with
Angels. Players' union has yet to approve plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although the players' union has not formally signed off, the Montreal
Expos will play 22 games in Puerto Rico next season, including three
with the World Series champion Angels on June 3-5.</LD>
<LD>   After attending an owners' meeting in Dallas on Wednesday where
the plan was officially approved, Angel Senior Vice President Kevin
Uhlich said he hadn't been aware of his club's involvement until
Tuesday, when notified by the commissioner's office.</LD>
<LD>   "My initial reaction was, 'Hey, great.' We were earmarked for a
very tough trip and this actually makes the travel a little easier,"
Uhlich said.</LD>
<TE>   A 12-game, four-city trip initially had the Angels traveling from
Anaheim to Baltimore to Tampa Bay to Montreal and to Florida again
for a three-game interleague series with the Marlins. The three games
in Puerto Rico keep them in the same geographic area.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Expos barely averaged 10,000 for home games last season
and remain somewhere between elimination and relocation while being
subsidized by the 29 other clubs, Commissioner Bud Selig said the
opportunity to play a quarter of the team's schedule in a "city and
region renowned for its production of players and the enthusiasm of
its fans" offered an opportunity that couldn't be ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking by phone from Dallas, where he also announced that the
Oakland A's and Seattle Mariners would open the 2003 season with two
games in Tokyo on March 25 and 26, Selig said that he hopes to
continue "taking the game to as many places as we can, playing
internationally as often as we can.... The games in Puerto Rico helps
us resolve the problem in the short-term and gives us time to
consider some long-term options."</TE>
<TE>   In the search for a permanent solution before the 2004 season,
Selig has appointed a relocation committee. How it plays out is
uncertain -- a suit filed against Selig and former Expo owner Jeffrey
Loria by 14 former minority owners of the club compounds the
situation -- but many in the industry think it will come down to an
auction between competing cities and/or groups in Northern Virginia,
Washington, Portland, Ore., and Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   As for Puerto Rico, Selig said, "Let's see how the games go this
year."</TE>
<TE>   The Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers opened the 2001 season in
San Juan and drew a capacity crowd of 19,891 to Hiram Bithorn
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos, with Vladimir Guerrero and Jose Vidro among several
Caribbean-area drawing cards, will play 10 April games there against
the New York Mets, Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds. They will play
six more in June, including the three with the Angels, and six in
September, including three with Sammy Sosa and the Chicago Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   Expo President Tony Tavares said the guaranteed income in U.S.
dollars from the Puerto Rico games would enable the club to avoid a
fire sale, and Frank Robinson, who has signed on for a second year as
Expo manager, said his players recognize they are in a unique
situation and have no control over where they play and won't be
affected by having two home fields.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be great to play in front of the people down there," he
said. "I spent nine years there managing in winter ball. They're
great fans, passionate about the game."</TE>
<TE>   Although the players' union is expected to approve the plan, a
union lawyer said the players would have preferred only two trips to
Puerto Rico to reduce dislocation and that certain allowances and
accommodations on behalf of the Montreal players were still being
negotiated. He referred to meal money in Puerto Rico, lodging there
and family travel -- recognition that the Expos will be a road team
for more than a fourth of their home schedule, taking on a financial
burden they otherwise wouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   He added, however, that given the miserable alternative of a full
season in Montreal, and the fact that the commissioner's office
permitted the situation there to deteriorate so badly, "The players
accept that this is the best idea for 2003, although certainly not a
long-term solution."</TE>
<TE>   In another development Wednesday, Selig said he will soon form a
special task force to address new and broader marketing concepts and
ideas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers promoted pitchers Andrew Brown, Alfredo Gonzalez,
Hong-Chih Kuo and Rick Roberts and catcher Koyie Hill to their 40-man
roster Wednesday, bringing to 38 the number of roster players.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>College football fans don't need an extra cup of coffee to keep alert
during rivalry week.</LD>
<LD>   They are already closely monitoring television programs for hints
of bias, counting the inches in newspapers, wondering how school X
managed to get 10 more inches of copy on Wednesday than school Z.</LD>
<LD>   It can even be difficult to get universities to agree on a team of
television announcers. Which is why the "Civil War" -- Oregon vs.
Oregon State -- almost didn't get on TV this year, according to the
Portland Oregonian.</LD>
<TE>   Veteran announcer Barry Tompkins, who wound up being acceptable to
both sides, says there is a fail-safe way of knowing whether he has
successfully straddled the line during a "Civil War" broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   "I always know I'm safe when I get hate mail from both sides,
which I'm sure will happen this game," he told the Oregonian's Rachel
Bachman.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What college football rivals play in the Egg Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   94 and counting: Someone was bound to puncture the good vibe
surrounding Dusty Baker's introduction as the new Cubs' manager at a
recent news gathering in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the Cubs' 94-year World Series drought came up.
Baker, looking startled, said: "I'm finding out all these numbers
when I got here."</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Chicago Sun-Times columnist Ron Rapoport: "Somebody had to
break the bad news to him at some point, I guess, and Baker did his
best to turn things around by saying, 'You can't bring the past with
you to the present.' "</TE>
<TE>   Thumbs down: There is no such thing as "only" an exhibition for
the Kentucky men's basketball team, as Pat Forde of the Louisville
Courier-Journal noted after Nike Elite defeated Kentucky on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The fans registered their disapproval, booing and hitting the
radio call-in shows.</TE>
<TE>   "Memo to Nike kingpin Phil Knight: Don't kill the golden goose,
dude," Forde wrote. "You're jeopardizing merchandise sales when this
team of vagabonds beats your flagship programs like UK and North
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "Not a loss that counts, of course, though you'd have a hard time
convincing UK fans of that. It's only mid-November, and toxicity
already is thick around this basketball program."</TE>
<TE>   Changing times: Florida State's Bobby Bowden has landed in trouble
before with his comments, including using "Let's roll" as a team
slogan.</TE>
<TE>   Asked for his thoughts on the controversy involving John Mackovic
and some of his players at Arizona, Bowden said, "I don't know what
happened out there. It's a sign of the times, nowadays. You'd better
be careful what you say to these boys ...</TE>
<TE>   "I heard 'verbal abuse.' Thirty years ago, we didn't know what
that was. You just did it anyway. You say what you want to say. It's
so politically correct nowadays, you'd better be politically correct
what you say, or you'll get yourself embarrassed."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Mississippi State-Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jennifer Capriati, 26, on having a parent as a
full-time coach on tour:</TE>
<TE>   "The parents have to realize also that there needs to be some
separation. If you're 30 and still traveling with your parents,
something is wrong there."</TE>

<HD>Clipper House Not in Order</HD>
<DH>They play poorly in fourth quarter and lose to the Kings,
93-89, for fifth loss in six games at Staples.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers ran up and down the court with gusto Wednesday night
against the Sacramento Kings. They overcame numerous and
all-too-familiar shortcomings by making up for them with gritty play.
They shot reasonably well, rebounded strongly at times and defended
their end of the floor as if it truly mattered.</LD>
<LD>   Then the fourth quarter began and the Clippers went kerplunk.</LD>
<LD>   Hey, it happens to the best of them. It just seems to happen to
the Clippers more often than it should on their home floor. A 93-89
loss to the Kings before a crowd of 18,087 was their fifth in six
games this season at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   To think the Clippers had so much going for them during a strong
third quarter in which they outscored the Kings, 22-19, holding them
to eight-for-28 shooting (28.6%), and seemed on the verge of their
most significant victory in 12 games this season.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they lost for the eighth time.</TE>
<TE>   Whipping the Golden State Warriors at Oakland on Monday and ending
a three-game losing streak was all well and good. A victory over the
Kings would have been a huge confidence boost for a team desperately
in need of one.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have won," center Michael Olowokandi said after scoring
eight points and taking 12 rebounds. "It's a tough one, a tough one."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers faded away down the stretch, succumbing to the Kings'
superior depth and balance. In the final analysis, the Kings won by
staying close and keeping their wits about them when the Clippers
seemed poised to break free in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento also survived a charge from a hot-shooting Corey
Maggette, who got the Clippers rolling with 13 points in the third
and two free throws and a three-pointer in the final 46.5 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   That's all the Clippers got late, however.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, they let a chance slip through their hands to tie the
Kings after Maggette's two free throws with 46.5 left and Sacramento
ahead, 89-86. Bobby Jackson missed a jumper with the 24-second shot
clock winding down, the rebound glanced off the hands of Maggette and
Olowokandi and the Kings kept possession.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers lost a seven-point lead in the third quarter after
Hedo Turkoglu drove to the hoop for two, made a jump shot, then
scored off Chris Webber's missed free throw, giving the Kings an
81-75 lead with 5:30 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette's three-pointer, the last of his season-best 30 points,
got the Clippers to within 91-89 in the closing seconds, but Peja
Stojakovic made two free throws for a 93-89 lead for the Kings with
15.2 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers failed to score again.</TE>
<TE>   Webber and Jackson scored 19 apiece for the Kings, playing without
point guard Mike Bibby, who has a stress fracture in his right foot
and isn't expected to play again until the middle of next month.</TE>
<TE>   "We had them on the ropes," Elton Brand said after scoring 21
points and taking 10 rebounds for his 11th consecutive double-double.
"They just have so many weapons that it's tough to keep them on the
ropes. They stepped up and made big plays. We need to step up and
make big plays. This was a winnable game."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers got off to their customary sluggish start, missing
five of their first seven shots and committing two turnovers en route
to a 10-4 deficit in the first five minutes. The Kings were no
bargain either, fumbling around and looking slightly bored with
having to play the Clippers rather than the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Now there's an opponent to get Sacramento's blood boiling.</TE>
<TE>   Soon enough, the Clippers exploited the Kings' lackluster play.
Webber picked up his fourth foul seconds before halftime and the
Clippers had a 46-44 lead and the momentum on their side. Early in
the third, they led by 51-44. Late in the third, they held a 68-62
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing because we expect to win every game, contrary
to what anybody else says," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said. "We
thought we played well enough to win. I still think we're going to be
a good team. I still think we're going to win a lot of games."</TE>

<HD>Eager Richardson Set to Practice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quentin Richardson smiled when someone wondered Wednesday if he was
prepared to fight through the pain of a bruised right knee the way
Philadelphia Eagle quarterback Donovan McNabb did in playing on a
broken ankle Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals.</LD>
<LD>   "Chi-town boys are tough," Richardson, a Chicago native, said with
a laugh.</LD>
<LD>   However, Richardson isn't about to push his knee before it's
sound.</LD>
<TE>   He is set to practice today with his teammates for the first time
since going on the injured list Nov. 12. He bumped his knee in the
first half of the Clippers' loss Nov. 8 to the New Jersey Nets.</TE>
<TE>   He also sprained the same knee running wind sprints Oct. 4 and
hyperextended it Nov. 3 against the Detroit Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson has had enough of sitting out.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tired of that," he said. "Hopefully, I'll play Friday. I'm
ready to get going."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers play at Denver on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see," Coach Alvin Gentry said when asked if Richardson
would be activated by Friday's game. "He wants to get in a hard
practice anyway. It won't do us any good unless he's ready to go all
out."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry plans to use Richardson in a reserve role, keeping Eric
Piatkowski as the team's starting shooting guard.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lamar Odom continues to rehabilitate his sprained right ankle. His
sprained right wrist is sound enough to allow to him play, but he's
waiting to gain strength in his ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Asked when he believed Odom would play, Gentry said, "December,"
while holding his hands far apart to signify the large window in
which the Clippers' leading scorer in 2000-01 is expected back on the
floor.</TE>

<HD>West Virginia's Defense Keys 21-18 Win Over Virginia Tech</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>West Virginia ran over No. 13 Virginia Tech for three quarters and
then made two defensive stands in the final minutes to preserve a
21-18 victory -- and its slim hopes for a Big East title.</LD>
<LD>   First, the Mountaineers (8-3, 5-1 in the conference) stopped the
Hokies on three successive rushes from inside the one-yard line, the
final one with 3:51 left. Then, Brian King intercepted Bryan
Randall's pass into the end zone with 12 seconds left -- a
questionable decision by Virginia Tech, considering the Hokies were
in range for a tying field-goal attempt.</LD>
<LD>   The loss was the third in a row for Virginia Tech (8-3, 3-3).</LD>
<TE>   Virginia Tech's Lee Suggs ran 28 yards for a touchdown in the
first half, giving him a touchdown in 24 consecutive games, an NCAA
record.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Clarett promised to be in Ohio State's lineup against No.
12 Michigan on Saturday, but how much he will play is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett has been struggling to recover from a shoulder injury that
has limited his play in the last three games for the No. 2 Buckeyes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There are no Big East championship banners hanging in the Orange
Bowl. There are no signs of Miami's seven conference titles in the
team's locker room, weight room or meeting room. And there's hardly a
mention of them in the media guide.</TE>
<TE>   "Just winning the Big East isn't good enough for us," linebacker
Howard Clark said. "Obviously it's important -- it gets us to the
next level, but just winning the Big East has never been enough. Our
real goal is the national championship. I'm not saying the Big East
is something shabby, but for this caliber team and what we expect,
it's not really important."</TE>
<TE>   Miami (9-0, 4-0) plays host to No. 17 Pittsburgh (8-2, 5-0)
tonight, and the winner will have the inside track for the conference
title and the league's automatic berth in the bowl championship
series.</TE>

<TE>   This slick, 181-page coffee table book reviews 35 of the most
memorable moments in television history, and 11 of them come from the
world of sports. The book, which comes with two CDs and a 150-minute
DVD attached inside the front cover, is the latest multimedia-genre
creation by Joe Garner of Encino.</TE>
<TE>   His other works include "And the Crowd Goes Wild," "We Interrupt
This Broadcast," and "And the Fans Roared," all of which made the New
York Times best-seller list.</TE>
<TE>   About one-third is devoted to classic television programs,
one-third to news events and one-third to sports. Narrating the CDs
and DVD are Dick Van Dyke, Walter Cronkite and Bob Costas.</TE>
<TE>   The first of the sports segments is a look back at ABC's "Wide
World of Sports." Then comes a review of home run records set by
Roger Maris, Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The third segment is on the black-power protest at the 1968 Mexico
City Olympics, the fourth is on the 1968 "Heidi Game," in which the
end of a thrilling game between the Oakland Raiders and New York Jets
was interrupted by a showing of the children's movie.</TE>
<TE>   The other sports events featured are all well-known. So are the
nonsports events, such as the "Vitameatavegamin" episode of "I Love
Lucy."</TE>
<TE>   What you have here is something that puts everything together --
in print, in a DVD, and on two audio CDs. All contain original
interviews and first-hand accounts from people directly involved.</TE>

<LD>Ohio State hosts Michigan this week in a game that means, gulp,
everything for the Buckeyes.</LD>
<LD>   Let the countdown -- or is that clampdown? -- begin.</LD>
<LD>   Every time you tell someone that believing in hexes is folly for
fools, that there's no such thing as one school having another's
number, Florida State misses a last-second field-goal attempt that
could have beaten Miami.</LD>
<TE>   It doesn't happen every year, but shoot if it didn't happen this
year when Wide Left I picked up for Wide Right III in the annals of
Florida State football.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan and Ohio State appear locked in a similar voodoo dance.</TE>
<TE>   The Buckeyes play in a stadium known as the Horseshoe and, just to
play it safe this week, they ought to nail one to the door above
their locker room.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State is 12-0 for the first time in school history, No. 2 in
the bowl championship series standings, and one teensy-weensy victory
over Michigan from playing for the national title in the Fiesta Bowl
on Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   So close, yet so Ann Arbor far.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Ohio State was 9-0-1 beginning Michigan week and needed a
win to go to the Rose Bowl. Michigan won, 28-0. This wasn't Tom
Harmon's Michigan, either. The Wolverines were 6-4 before the game,
but created enough hocus-pocus that two Ohio State quarterbacks
combined for four interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the most embarrassing games I think I've ever been
associated with," Buckeyes' Coach John Cooper said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper would be associated with others.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Ohio State was 11-0 and ranked No. 2 before the
regular-season ender against No. 18 Michigan. Ohio State receiver
Terry Glenn proclaimed, "Michigan is nobody. I guarantee we're going
to the Rose Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   Postscript: Michigan's Tim Biakabutuka rushed for 313 yards in the
Wolverines' 31-23 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State went to the Citrus Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I've ever been as disappointed in my life,"
Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   No one at the time said, "Wait 'til next year, coach."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, in 1996, Ohio State again was undefeated, at 10-0,
and No. 2 before playing Michigan. No more Terry Glenn bulletin-board
bluster this time, as Cooper ordered a media quarantine. The Buckeyes
came out so tight they squeaked, settling for three first-half field
goals instead of touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   On the second play of the second half, Michigan backup quarterback
Brian Griese hit Tai Streets on a 68-yard scoring pass and the
Wolverines went on to a 13-9 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, honestly, I'm in denial," Buckeye linebacker Greg
Bellisari groaned afterward. "I can't believe this just happened."</TE>
<TE>   The face of Ohio State football in monumental games against
Michigan is basically the face of William Shatner staring out an
airplane window in that famous "Twilight Zone" episode.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, you can say history is bunk, that all those costly
Ohio State defeats at the hands of Michigan were random and unrelated
acts.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, with another national title berth at stake Saturday,
that's not a bad way to approach it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there's some people that are still out there saying it,
they've always had our number and we've been in this situation before
and they've always beat us and ruined our perfect season," Ohio State
quarterback Craig Krenzel said.</TE>
<TE>   Krenzel isn't buying it.</TE>
<TE>   "People can sit there and talk about what happened 10 years ago,
but that's just people trying to have something to say and trying to
make conversation," he said. "It really has no relevance on this
Saturday's football game."</TE>
<TE>   Buckeye fans have reason to feel better about the Michigan menace
this year.</TE>
<TE>   For one, John Cooper is no longer Buckeye coach. For all his
abilities at talent procurement and pushing the Buckeyes to the
precipice, Cooper had this thing about the Wolverines. He couldn't
beat them when it counted, going 2-10-1 in 13 tries, adding only
triskaidekaphobia to this tale of whoa.</TE>
<TE>   The more Cooper pressed, the more it reflected on Ohio State
performances.</TE>
<TE>   Take 1996: All year, against the judgment of many, Cooper started
Stanley Jackson at quarterback over Joe Germaine.</TE>
<TE>   Germaine was the better quarterback, but the team was 10-0 when
Jackson started. So what does Cooper do against Michigan? He starts
Germaine and the Buckeyes lose.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, just cleaning out the coach's office can help in
matters of the Michigan kind. Jim Tressel replaced Cooper two years
ago and immediately announced he was going to stomp some Wolverine
tail.</TE>
<TE>   Tressel didn't need a recitation on Ohio State miseries against
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if that's the type of history we study," he said
this week. "I think we do study what makes the difference in big
games."</TE>
<TE>   Senior linebacker Matt Wilhelm, who played for Cooper, remembers
in the spring of 2001 going over game film of Ohio State's 2000
defeat to Michigan (known in Columbus as "why?2k").</TE>
<TE>   "We just broke the game down," Wilhelm said. "You talk about the
ups and downs of a season, but there's many ups and downs throughout
just one Michigan game. Whether it be how key a turnover is, or not
splitting defenders and getting the extra yard for the first down."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Tressel's first, Ohio State went to Ann Arbor and
beat Michigan, 26-20.</TE>
<TE>   It was that game, not the ghost of Thanksgiving weekend past, that
makes Ohio State players think this year is going to be different.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we gained a lot of confidence going up and winning the
way we did," Wilhelm said. "Having control of the game for almost the
entire game and really having no threat of them coming back toward
the end of the game, that really gives this team a lot more
confidence as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Ohio State was 6-4, not 12-0, before last year's
showdown.</TE>
<TE>   The Michigan win earned Ohio State a trip to the Outback Bowl, not
the Fiesta.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are gargantuan this year, and Michigan has little to
lose.</TE>
<TE>   You can't say the same about Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   USC/BCS</TE>
<TE>   News item: USC sends two athletic department staffers to lobby the
Sugar and Orange bowls for a possible BCS at-large position.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: USC is not going to win a head-to-head battle against
Notre Dame with the Orange Bowl. If Miami, Ohio State and Washington
State win out, the Orange Bowl is going to use its at-large pick on
Notre Dame even if USC defeated the Irish.</TE>
<TE>   USC's best chance for an at-large choice is to hope a Miami loss
puts Ohio State and Washington State in the Fiesta Bowl. In that
case, the Rose Bowl could fill the at-large spots with USC vs. Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Here's another way the 10-2 Trojans could not be denied: get to
No. 4 in the final BCS standings. That would guarantee USC an
at-large spot under BCS rules. It's not as farfetched as it sounds.
The Trojans are No. 8 in the BCS this week, trailing No. 7 Iowa by
only 1.88 points. USC has two games left, while Iowa's regular season
is finished. Two wins for USC would likely vault the Trojans over
Iowa and Notre Dame. From there, USC could get the No. 4 spot if two
of the five teams ahead of it slip.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans would have been in even better shape had No. 5 Georgia
not defeated Auburn last week on a fourth-down, fourth-quarter
touchdown pass.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   The major conference races in a nutshell:</TE>
<TE>   Pac-10: Washington State can clinch the title with a win either
this week against Washington or at UCLA on Dec. 7. USC needs a win
and two Washington State defeats; UCLA needs to beat USC and two
Washington State defeats.</TE>
<TE>   Big 12: Colorado has clinched the North. Texas Tech can steal the
South with a win at Oklahoma this weekend in Norman.</TE>
<TE>   SEC: Georgia won the East last week, but the West is still wild,
with the title likely going to the LSU-Arkansas winner on Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Big East: Pittsburgh and Miami play tonight for sole possession of
first. Pittsburgh takes the title if it beats Miami and West
Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   ACC: Florida State wins the title and a BCS bowl berth if it beats
North Carolina State this weekend. If Florida State loses its last
two games, though, Maryland can get the bid if it beats Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   The "A" this year at Alabama stands for "anonymous." The Crimson
Tide, at 10-2, are among the nation's hottest teams but aren't listed
in the BCS standings because the school is on NCAA probation.
Unofficially, Alabama is No. 9, and having a stealth-like impact on
the national title race.</TE>
<TE>   How? No. 4 Oklahoma and No. 5 Georgia are getting quality win
points for their victories over Alabama, although those points will
count only if the Crimson Tide finishes ranked in the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with Alabama and the BCS is that the coaches' poll
doesn't include schools on probation, yet the BCS still needed to
account for victories scored against Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   So, the Crimson Tide's BCS ranking has been computed without use
of the coaches' poll. Michigan ranks No. 9 in the BCS this week but
is really No. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Get it?</TE>
<TE>   The Big Ten is by far the nation's most top-heavy conference,
boasting four schools in this week's BCS top 15, yet is in jeopardy
of not having enough bowl-eligible teams to fill its seven slots. The
Big Ten has five bowl-eligible schools with two on the bubble.
Wisconsin (6-6) needs to beat Minnesota to become qualified and
Purdue (5-6) needs a win over Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Happy football anniversaries this week to Cal vs. Stanford and
"The Play" game (Nov. 20, 1982) and Doug Flutie beats Miami, 47-45,
with last-second pass to Gerard Phelan (Nov. 23, 1984).</TE>

10  KANSAS STATE  (9-2)     School wonders if playing Nebraska every

11  MICHIGAN  (9-2)         Lloyd Carr to play role of himself

12  TEXAS  (9-2)            It's shaping up as another crummy 10-win

15  PENN STATE  (8-3)       Big Ten officials retaliate by hanging a

17  MARYLAND  (9-2)         Still has a chance to claim the ACC's BCS

                            about two or three weeks
18  COLORADO STATE (9-2)    BCS pop quiz: The two teams to beat the

                            State
19  PITTSBURGH  (8-2)       Pitt Coach Walt Harris tells his team,

                            weeks
21  LOUISIANA STATE (7-3)   Rankman's sure-fire tip of the week:

                            miracle play the week before
22  BOISE STATE  (10-1)     Rankman wonders if seagulls, mistaking
                            blue field for lake, are still bobbing
                            for fish on 50-yard line
23  UCLA  (7-3)             Tyler Ebell may not be very big or
                            strong, but at least he's small and
                            doesn't weigh much
24  TEXAS TECH  (8-4)       School selling tapes of Texas win for
                            $19.95. What's next, a Bob Knight
                            Christmas album?
25  TEXAS CHRISTIAN  (8-1)  Found this team at bottom of Rankman's
                            top-25 sock drawer and thought it would
                            match my Texas Tech sock</TE>

<LD>Niclas Havelid and Pavel Trnka have made Fredrik Olausson expendable,
at least for the moment.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks are going to sit Olausson, a 37-year-old defenseman,
until he can get himself into shape to play. The Ducks will go with
six defensemen for the time being. It's a luxury that Havelid and
Trnka for the most part have made possible.</LD>
<LD>   Havelid has two goals and five points, with one goal and two
assists on the power play. He had taken over on the top power-play
unit even before Olausson was sidelined.</LD>
<TE>   "The biggest surprise I've had this season has been Havelid,"
Coach Mike Babcock said. "I already thought he was good. That I'm
surprised by his play shows how good he has been."</TE>
<TE>   Havelid had some dicey moments in Tuesday's 3-2 overtime loss to
the New York Rangers. Twice during the game, he turned the puck over
deep in Duck territory and had to be bailed out by goalie
Jean-Sebastien Giguere.</TE>
<TE>   A groin injury had Trnka on injured reserve when the season
started. He wasn't activated until before the Columbus game last
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Trnka assisted on Jason Krog's game-tying goal against Columbus
and on Petr Sykora's goal against Atlanta on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks will miss forward Mike Leclerc more than when they lost
center Adam Oates. At least when Oates went down with a broken hand,
Matt Cullen was around to move to center, giving the Ducks experience
in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   Leclerc, who is out three to four weeks after knee surgery, leaves
a bigger hole ... one that is 6 feet 2 and 215 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Alexei Smirnov, a 6-4, 218-pound rookie, has the size to
fill some of that void. But he has been inconsistent, as rookies tend
to be. He has one goal and one assist, but both came in the season
opener against St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't play on the penalty kill or power play, that's a long
time between shifts," Babcock said. "Sometimes he goes to sleep on
us. That's not his fault. I have to find a way to get work for him."</TE>

<HD>Couples, O'Meara to Cross Line</HD>
<DH>Former champions say they will play Masters, and both
believe Woods is being unfairly singled out in controversy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Masters champions Fred Couples and Mark O'Meara said Wednesday
that they have no intention of following the Rev. Jesse Jackson's
suggestion that professional golfers stay away from the Masters to
protest the lack of female members at Augusta National. Couples, the
1992 champion, and O'Meara, who won in 1998, also said it is unfair
to single out Tiger Woods in the lingering controversy over the
private, men-only club.</LD>
<LD>   "Am I going to adhere to a picket line?" O'Meara said. "Listen, I
am all for women's rights. I am for equal pay and for women doing as
good a job as men....</LD>
<LD>   "But I think this is getting a little out of control, in my
opinion."</LD>
<TE>   In another development in the five-month-old controversy, LPGA
Commissioner Ty Votaw said the time has come for Augusta National to
open its doors to a female member. In a state-of-the-tour speech at
West Palm Beach, Fla., the site of the LPGA's Tour Championship,
Votaw said he needed to take a stand.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the right thing to do is to admit women so we can move
on from this damaging and distracting debate," Votaw said later in a
telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   "It is Augusta's right as a private organization not to admit
women, but it is not the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   But while Votaw called for an end to the controversy, it seems to
be picking up speed and spinning in new directions, almost daily.</TE>
<TE>   In a prepared statement, Glenn Greenspan, director of
communications for Augusta National, said single-gender organizations
are legally and morally proper.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear that millions of Americans both support and belong to
these organizations," Greenspan said. "The Ladies Professional Golf
Assn. is entitled to its opinion too, but we respectfully disagree."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said Friday that "people of good will," including sponsors
and golfers, should not cross a possible picket line at Augusta
National, which hosts the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson vowed to organize a protest and said such a picket line
identifies "gender apartheid" at the club.</TE>
<TE>   However, neither Couples nor O'Meara said they could support
Jackson's position.</TE>
<TE>   O'Meara termed the standoff between Martha Burk, chairwoman of the
National Council of Women's Organizations, and Augusta National
Chairman Hootie Johnson "an unfortunate situation" between opposing
sides with differing, strong opinions.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I look at the whole situation, women are allowed to play
golf [at Augusta National]," O'Meara said. "It is not an all-men's
club in that women are not allowed to play there at all. Certainly,
the attention that there is not a woman member there does bring a
point.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that going to keep me from playing there? No. I am a golf pro.
This is what I do. The Masters and Augusta National have things about
them that you love and there are things about them that you do not
necessarily agree with.</TE>
<TE>   "I would think that sooner or later, a woman will be a member.
Does that make everything hunky-dory? I don't know. Martha Burk has
made a point. Hootie is trying to stay his ground because he feels it
is a private club."</TE>
<TE>   Couples and O'Meara made their comments in a conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who is in Japan playing an exhibition, affirmed his
intention to play the Masters, where he is a three-time winner and
two-time defending champion. Woods said he was frustrated at being
mentioned in a New York Times editorial that urged him, and no one
else by name, to skip the Masters as a gesture against the club's
membership policy.</TE>
<TE>   Woods has said that a woman should be invited to join Augusta as a
member, but that he has no vote in the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Couples said Woods is right to feel frustrated at being singled
out in the newspaper's editorial.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is highly unfair that anyone throw him to the wolves
and try to have him make a statement that says 'I am not going to
play.' He plays golf for a living.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel like it is a little bit of nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   There will be a woman member at Augusta National, Couples
predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll happen the way Augusta wants it to happen," he said. "And I
think Tiger will like the decision, but so will I and so will Mark
O'Meara. I just feel like, this poor kid, any time something happens,
he needs to have a comment, and he does it with his golf clubs."</TE>
<TE>   If the controversy is bad for Woods, Votaw said it is bad for
golf. He said the time for debate has passed, that no story or poll
overrides the fact that not admitting women to the club is an error.</TE>
<TE>   "Augusta's exclusionary practices with respect to women speak
volumes to the world and to the game of golf," Votaw said. "The
message it sends is that women cannot be part of that face of golf,
and that is wrong. Augusta has broken the race barrier but has chosen
not to break the gender barrier."</TE>
<TE>   Votaw also said the LPGA's board of directors has agreed to his
proposal to try to change the LPGA bylaws and open the teaching club
professional membership to men.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Barber has been inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Southern
California Section of the PGA. Barber, a 34-year member of the PGA of
America, is the son of former PGA Tour player Jerry Barber. The SCPGA
also named Ron Skayhan, a teaching pro at Hillcrest Country Club, as
player of the year and Tom Schauppner, the pro at Long Beach Golf
Center, as senior player of the year.</TE>

<LD>Carson junior quarterback Beau Davis has quit the team on the week of
the Colts' first-round City Section playoff game against L.A.
Jefferson.</LD>
<LD>   Coach John Aguirre confirmed that Davis decided to leave the team
on Monday after a meeting between the two.</LD>
<LD>   Davis had been sharing duties with sophomore Boneigh Napoleon.
Napoleon threw five touchdown passes and Davis one in last week's
61-22 victory over Wilmington Banning.</LD>
<TE>   Aguirre said Wednesday that he is open to Davis' returning. Davis
completed 48 of 112 passes for 1,005 yards and nine touchdowns with
five interceptions.</TE>

<TE>   Bob Messina, the principal at Canyon Country Canyon, says there is
no evidence supporting accusations of illegal recruiting by the
school's cross-country coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Messina and Vice Principal Bill Bolde began an investigation after
Messina received a letter on Nov. 5 accusing Canyon's coaches and
parents of some team members of recruiting middle-school runners from
outside the school's attendance area.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was signed by cross-country and track coaches from
Newhall Hart, Saugus and Valencia, the other three schools in the
Santa Clarita Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Dave DeLong, a Canyon co-coach, denied the allegations from the
start and Messina echoed those sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that our coaching staff is on the up and up," Messina
said. "We checked out the accusations and found that they were based
on false information."</TE>
<TE>   Ashlee Brown of Riverside North, the two-time defending state
champion in the girls' 300-meter low hurdles, has signed a letter of

<LD>CITY SECTION</LD>
<LD>   Dorsey (4-6) at Franklin (9-1), 7, tonight</LD>
<LD>   Northern League champion Franklin, the eighth-seeded team, has
plenty of motivation, hoping to send longtime Coach Armando Gonzalez
out after a long run in the playoffs. The Panthers can move the ball
with quarterback Narciso Diaz (66.7% passing, 2,864 yards, 32
touchdowns) and wide receivers Brandon Powers (67 catches, 1,336
yards) and Adam Viola (39 catches, 754 yards), but they have not been
in sync offensively the last two weeks. Ninth-seeded Dorsey isn't the
same team that won the City Section championship last year, but the
Dons are always dangerous in the playoffs. Dorsey has won three of
its last four games and was only a minute away from upsetting
Coliseum League champion Crenshaw last week. Running back Jeremiah
Johnson will prove a major test for the Franklin defense.</LD>
<TE>   -- Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Fremont (8-2) at Venice (8-2), 7, tonight</TE>
<TE>   The section's most intriguing first-round matchup figures to have
a number of college scouts in attendance. Fremont started 7-0 but
suffered consecutive losses to Crenshaw and Dorsey, falling to a No.
13 seeding. The Pathfinders have plenty of playmakers, among them
wide receiver Mark Bradford, running backs Milvon James and Eric
Jones, and tight end Thomas Herring. Herring, a 6-foot-7, 290-pound
junior, is also a force on the defensive line. Venice was seeded
fourth after winning the Western League. The Gondoliers' only losses
have come by one point to Santa Monica and by five points to La Verne
Damien. Big wide receivers B.J. Vickers (58 receptions, 1,245 yards)
and Antwuan Giddens (49 receptions, 1,011 yards) create matchup
problems on the outside for opponents. Senior quarterback Eddie
Miller leads the section with 3,086 yards passing and running back
Byron Ellis (1,051 yards) has had several big games. The decisive
factor could be whether Venice's offensive line gives Miller time to
throw.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   SOUTHERN SECTION</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita (6-4) vs. Anaheim Esperanza (9-1) at Placentia
Valencia High, 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   A tough first-round game for Esperanza in the Division I playoffs.
The Aztecs lost only once and were rewarded by drawing Santa
Margarita, which will have a healthy Ashton White. A senior running
back, White missed two games because of a knee injury, but spurred
the Eagles to a 19-0 victory over then-No. 5 Mater Dei on Nov. 8.
White has 1,000 yards rushing and 10 touchdowns in 200 carries.
Esperanza, in Coach Gary Meek's final season before taking over as
the school's athletic director, is led by quarterback Rick Taloa, who
has 20 touchdown passes and only five interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   La Puente Bishop Amat (5-5) vs. Redlands (7-3) at University of
Redlands, 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   These are two teams attempting to salvage disappointing seasons by
making their mark in the playoffs. Redlands won its last four games
after opening Citrus Belt League play with a loss to eventual
champion Rialto Eisenhower, but the Terriers hardly inspire fear the
way they did last season, when they went undefeated in the regular
season. Bishop Amat had to win its last two games just to get into
the playoffs, though the Lancers played as well as anyone during the
final weeks of the season. Running back Chris Seals gained 187 yards
last week in a 37-20 victory over Santa Margarita. Running back Zach
James (983 yards, 11 touchdowns), quarterback Brandon D'Amico (1,034
yards, eight touchdowns) and receiver Brian Walsh (497 yards, three
touchdowns) have been the mainstays for Redlands.</TE>
<TE>   -- Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   Etiwanda (8-2) at Canyon Country Canyon (9-1), 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   This is the equivalent of the NCAA men's basketball tournament
play-in game, since the winner likely will draw top-seeded Mission
Viejo in the second round. Overachieving Etiwanda, which finished in
a three-way tie for first in the Baseline League after being picked
by some to finish last, will rely on the power running of tailback
Chris Lavalle (1,587 yards) and fullback Paul Unga (798). Canyon
Country Canyon has proved it can stop the run -- the Cowboys held
touted Valencia tailback Charles Burnley to 58 yards in 19 carries.
Canyon has good offensive balance with quarterback Nate Longshore
(1,695 yards) and running back Louis Montano (1,282 yards).</TE>
<TE>   -- Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo Grande (6-3) vs. Ventura St. Bonaventure (9-1) at Santa
Barbara City College, 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo Grande was ranked No. 1 in Division IV after going 5-0,
then lost three of four Pac 5 League games to end up as a
fourth-place team and a dangerous first-round opponent for the
top-seeded Seraphs. Arroyo Grande's offense has been sputtering, but
the Eagle defense features safety Chad Simonson, a four-year starter.
St. Bonaventure relies on the passing of junior quarterback Brian
Stevens (2,094 yards, 26 touchdowns) and the all-around play of
Whitney Lewis (870 yards receiving, 561 yards rushing, 26
touchdowns).</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   Irvine (6-4) vs. Orange Lutheran (8-2) at Brea Olinda High, 7:30
p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   As Terrell Vinson goes, so goes Irvine. Vinson has rushed for
1,805 yards and scored 22 touchdowns, and accounted for 134 of
Irvine's 217 points this season. He also returns punts and kickoffs,
and special teams could play a critical role in this game's outcome.
Second-seeded Orange Lutheran, which last season was seeded second
and finished as runner-up to St. Bonaventure in Division XI, is more
balanced but is without its best player, tailback John Ausmus, who
broke his leg in Week 7. In his absence, Brent Concolino has averaged
9.8 yards per carry. The Lancers are averaging 29.6 points and
haven't lost since dropping successive games to Santa Ana Mater Dei,
21-20, and Anaheim Servite, 34-3, to open the season.</TE>

<LD>Losing rarely inspires confidence, but then again, most teams don't
have to play Long Beach Poly every season.</LD>
<LD>   Lakewood (8-2) will play host to its first Southern Section
football playoff game in 19 years Friday, opening its gates for
perennial power Los Angeles Loyola (7-3) in a Division I first-round
matchup.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Mike Christensen said his players shouldn't be nervous about
their performance in the playoffs, especially after their strong
showing three weeks ago in a 28-12 loss to Long Beach Poly, the
division's top-seeded team and its three-time defending champion.</LD>
<TE>   "We played Poly really well," Christensen said. "The score might
be a little misleading, but we had five turnovers in the game and we
haven't done that all season."</TE>
<TE>   The Jackrabbits clung to a 7-6 lead before pulling away during a
four-minute stretch of the third quarter, when they scored 14 points
off two turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe if we play them again, we might have a chance at beating
them," said Jason Leggett, a senior running back whose school records
for rushing yardage (1,737) and touchdowns (23) helped Lakewood
rebound from its 1-8 record last season.</TE>
<TE>   He carried the Lancers to a second-place finish in the Moore
League, rushing for 223 yards and three touchdowns despite suffering
a mild ankle sprain in a 28-17 victory Friday over Long Beach
Millikan, his former team.</TE>
<TE>   Leggett left Millikan after his sophomore year because he said he
didn't foresee much playing time in the Rams' wing-T offense.</TE>
<TE>   Christensen said Leggett would be "100% ready" for Friday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been getting better as the season goes along," Leggett
said. "We haven't played our best though. Our best is yet to come."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Gorgonio gave retiring Athletic Director John Powell an early
going-away party, winning the San Andreas League title for its first
football league championship in 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The school and the community are thrilled about winning it
outright," said Powell, who was a third-year assistant coach the last
time the Spartans won a league title.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said the tough competition San Gorgonio faced over the
years kept league championships out of reach. The Spartans moved from
the powerful Citrus Belt League to the San Andreas League 10 years
ago, but the competition remained solid.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask me why it has taken so long to win another league
title," Powell said. "Well, we've had some outstanding competition
over the years. There's no mystery to it. They were a little better
than we were."</TE>
<TE>   San Gorgonio (9-1) didn't get much of a break in the Division V
playoff pairings, drawing a first-round visit on Friday from Corona
Santiago (6-4), the at-large qualifier from the Mountain View League,
and its formidable quarterback Bernard Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Section will begin using Spaulding footballs in all
its playoff games during the next four weeks, said Rob Wigod, the
assistant commissioner in charge of football.</TE>
<TE>   The section entered a business partnership with Spaulding 18
months ago, which requires teams to use the company's ball for all
playoff games except tennis, water polo and baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Because the agreement was being negotiated during last season's
fall playoffs, Spaulding footballs were available only for the
division championship games and use of them was not mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   Wigod said such business partnerships are a major source of
revenue for the section.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not raised our [member schools'] dues since 1984," Wigod
said. "Business partnerships and championship revenues account for
89% of our revenue."</TE>
<TE>   Spaulding balls were used in the Division I game last season, when
Huntington Beach Edison quarterback Tommy Grady threw for 268 yards
and four touchdowns in a 42-28 loss to Long Beach Poly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wigod said he was irritated to read several comments in a San
Bernardino County newspaper from coaches whose teams did not receive
at-large berths into the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Some coaches griped when three teams from the Serra League were
awarded at-large berths in Division I, along with Edison, which
finished 4-6 but won one game by forfeit.</TE>
<TE>   Another coach was upset Corona Santiago (6-4) was given an
at-large berth in Division V rather than his 7-3 team.</TE>
<TE>   Wigod suggested coaches pay more attention to the strength of
schedule and quality of victories, rather than simply won-loss
records.</TE>
<TE>   "Santiago won three of its last four games, beat [Lake Elsinore]
Temescal Canyon and [Temecula] Chaparral, both playoff teams from
strong leagues, and comes from a league that produced the top-seeded
team [Corona Centennial]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of disappointing to get blasted like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Thompkins at Rialto Eisenhower and Doug Dubois  at Moreno
Valley Canyon Springs are two young coaches who have been extremely
successful this season.</TE>
<TE>   Thompkins, 26, led the Eagles to a 5-0 Citrus Belt League record
after an 0-5 start in his first season. Eisenhower began its
turnaround by beating title favorite Redlands, 19-14, in the league
opener.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower plays host to Anaheim Servite in a Division I game on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Dubois, who recently turned 28, led the Cougars to an 8-1-1 record
in his second season, the team's best mark since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon Springs, which finished second to Riverside North in the
Ivy League after losing to the Huskies, 28-17, on Friday, is seeded
fourth in the Division V playoffs and plays host to Norco on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove Rancho Alamitos needed to beat Garden Grove Santiago
to earn its first playoff berth since 1998, and senior Tai Asoau made
sure it happened. Asoau rushed 33 times for 306 yards and scored
twice in a 19-7 victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Vaqueros (7-3) have won three in a row behind Asoau, who began
the winning streak by rushing for 335 yards and five touchdowns
against Huntington Beach Ocean View and followed with a 201-yard,
seven-touchdown performance against Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Asoau has scored 27 touchdowns. "We had to win to go to the
playoffs," Coach Mike Enright said, "and he basically said he was
going to carry us."</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Alamitos plays Pomona (9-1), the Valle Vista League
champion, in a Division IX game at 7 p.m. Saturday at Ganesha High.</TE>

<HD>Corona del Mar Ends Up in Familiar Spot</HD>

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The championship ring was raised a lot higher this season for the
Corona del Mar boys' water polo team. After winning their third
consecutive Southern Section Division II title last season, the Sea
Kings were moved into Division I.</LD>
<LD>   But that wasn't enough to keep Corona del Mar from returning to
the title game. The second-seeded Sea Kings edged third-seeded North
Hollywood Harvard-Westlake, 3-2, in a semifinal game Wednesday at
Newport Harbor High.</LD>
<LD>   The Sea Kings (21-7) will meet top-seeded Long Beach Wilson,
winner of five titles in six years, in the championship game Saturday
at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Corona del Mar goalkeeper Beau Stockstill led a strong defensive
effort against Harvard-Westlake, stopping 16 shots and collecting
four steals.</TE>
<TE>   "All 28 minutes were intense," said Stockstill, a senior. "Against
Harvard-Westlake, you can't let down your guard."</TE>
<TE>   John Money also contributed several big plays on both ends of the
pool. He had two key steals late in the third quarter and early in
the fourth to help the Sea Kings preserve their 2-1 lead, then scored
from outside to put his team ahead by two goals with 4:28 remaining
in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson withstood Lake Forest El Toro's third-quarter comeback and
pulled away to win the other semifinal, 13-11, at Newport Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers (23-8) rallied from an 8-4 deficit early in the
second half and tied the score, 9-9, on a man-advantage goal by Chris
Allen with 12 seconds left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson (30-0) moved back ahead on Thomas Hale's team-high sixth
goal of the game, then took an 11-9 lead on Clint Wilson's goal. The
Chargers twice cut the lead to one, but the Bruins went ahead, 13-11,
on a goal by Matt Norris with 2:57 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   Jee Hee Hwang of Lake Balboa Birmingham and Granada Hills repeated
as City Section girls' golf champions at Balboa Golf Course in
Encino.</TE>
<TE>   Hwang, a senior, shot five-over-par 77 to win the individual title
by one shot over Maria Lamela of Carson. Lamela, the 2000 champion,
was runner-up for the second year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Hwang finished with a double bogey and two bogeys in her last
three holes but held on to defeat Lamela, who shot even-par 35 on the
back nine.</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills dominated the team event, shooting a four-player
score of 355 to win by 54 shots over Chatsworth. Lucy Davies led the
the Highlanders with a 79 and Alyson Golditch shot 82. The team score
was 95 strokes better than the 450 Granada Hills shot to win last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills and Chatsworth advance to the CIF-WSCGA finals Dec.
3 at the SCGA Members Club in Murrieta. The top 10 individuals also
advance.</TE>

<KH>KING REPORT</KH>
<HD>Allison Is Cautious on Return Date</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Jason Allison has started skating in El Segundo and says the
rehabilitation of his injured right knee is progressing well.</LD>
<LD>   But the Kings' top-line center labeled as premature Wednesday a
published report that, according to his agent, he could be back in
the lineup by the middle of next month, two weeks ahead of the most
optimistic timetable.</LD>
<LD>   "It's way too early," said Allison, who was injured in a
knee-on-knee collision with defenseman Andy Sutton of the Atlanta
Thrashers on Oct. 29. "I mean, I feel good, considering what
happened....</LD>
<TE>   "Maybe I'll surprise people, but I don't know. I mean, I've [only]
skated by myself. Once you're pushing and you're off-balance, it's a
huge difference."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray has said he doesn't expect to have Allison, 27,
back in the lineup until February. When Allison was injured, the
Kings projected he would be sidelined eight to 12 weeks. A return
after eight weeks would put him in the lineup for a Dec. 26 game, a
return after 12 for a Jan. 22 game.</TE>
<TE>   "If I get back in eight, we'll be happy," said Allison, who has
skated 20-45 minutes a day each of the last four days, a brace on his
injured knee, and continues to ice the knee four or five times a day.
"If something happened and I felt unbelievable and thought I could
play [before then], then we'd have a discussion with the doctors and
the coaches and management about whether it was possible."</TE>
<TE>   His agent, Bryant McBride, said a target date for Allison's return
has not been set, "but Jason's champing at the bit to come back
early."</TE>
<TE>   Allison, who with wife Christine launched a charity foundation
Wednesday and will host a celebrity bowling tournament Jan. 20 in
Torrance, said he didn't want to blindly accept a prognosis of eight
to 12 weeks on the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to look at it and say, 'If I'm back in 10, great,' "
he said. "I want to look at it like, I'm going to do as much as I can
to get back as soon as I can."</TE>

<HD>Kobe's Criticism Nothing New</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>So much of it was left to Kobe Bryant. In the time it took the Lakers
to lose seven of eight games, he'd had his moments of disgust, of
anger, and a couple of joy. But mostly, frustration.</LD>
<LD>   He rarely was easy on himself or his teammates, and sometimes it
was loud, and lately it has been public.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think it endears his teammates to him, but they know he
drives a hard bargain," said Coach Phil Jackson, known to drive a
bargain or two himself. "That's typical of what he's been saying.
We've got guys who are young and inexperienced and guys who are
experienced trying to get into the best playing condition possible.
He's got two different groups of players, so he's preaching to the
choir.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not totally pleased with it, to be honest with you. But I
can't help but think that it's going to motivate his players a little
bit, or his teammates, to step up and meet the challenge. This is a
relationship I've had with these players. Ten of us go back a couple
years. Eight of us go back three years. They have a relationship.
Five of them have a relationship for six, seven years. They know who
he is and they know what he's talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox, with Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal one of three Laker
captains, said he understands Bryant's criticism and disappointment
with so many poor games. And while the scolding is uncomfortable in
public, it's rarely the first time the Lakers have heard it.</TE>
<TE>   "If he didn't do it behind closed doors, it would be
questionable," Fox said. "He's pretty direct across the board. What
he has to be careful about is, as a teammate, taking things into a
public arena. The only thing that holds this together, especially
now, is that we keep everyone protected.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand it for what it is and don't take it as a personal
attack. It's a strong criticism of our games more than us
personally."</TE>

<HD>Lakers Hope It's Last Straw</HD>
<DH>O'Neal should be back Friday, after team drops into Pacific
Division cellar with 95-88 loss to Spurs.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Of all the grim-faced men who walked away from the Lakers' seventh
loss in eight games, the largest one did not limp, did not grimace,
did not complain, and that would have to do.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers on Wednesday night reached what many assume to be the
last of their games without Shaquille O'Neal with a 95-88 loss to the
San Antonio Spurs. Of those 12 games, they won three, one since Nov.
3, and by the time their chartered jet cleared Texas air space, they
were in last place in the Pacific Division.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been searching for something to get us turned around,"
forward Rick Fox said. "That's definitely a good start, to get him
back on the floor.</LD>
<TE>   "We'd like to think he's going to make a huge difference. [But] we
still have to play better."</TE>
<TE>   In their first look at the new SBC Center, the Lakers had their
best shooting half in two weeks (50% in the first) and followed it
with another clunker (31.6% in the second), all the help the Spurs
required.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, who played on a sprained left ankle and with a
sprained left thumb, scored 25 points, but was three for 14 from the
field in the second half and 15 for 46 on a two-game trip that
started in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Jackson came off the Spur bench and scored 28 points in 29
minutes. His eight three-point field goals, in 10 attempts, were the
most ever by a Laker opponent.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs had a 14-2 run in the fourth quarter that finished the
otherwise game Lakers, who held Tim Duncan to seven points in the
first three quarters, then allowed him nine in the fourth. The Spurs
missed 18 of their first 19 shots and still won, by the end with some
ease.</TE>
<TE>   "We played this game well enough to have won," a tight-lipped Phil
Jackson said afterward. "We just wasted an effort down the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was medically cleared to play by the doctor who performed
the surgery, and so the decision lies with him. If he returns as
expected Friday and does not sit out another game, he'll play in 70
games, or three more than he did last season, when the Lakers won 58
games.</TE>
<TE>   Though Jackson hadn't announced today's schedule by the time the
bus pulled out, Laker players expected to practice today for O'Neal's
benefit.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have arrived -- probably -- at the return of O'Neal
with some fatigue and faulty shooting, but if he plays Friday they've
arrived, and that's the important thing.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry (season-high 14 points), Samaki Walker (10 rebounds)
and Slava Medvedenko can go back to concentrating on power forwards.
The shooters get their cushions back. Everybody might get some rest.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to continue to get better, that's all," Bryant said.
"I think with Shaquille getting back, players will get back to their
usual niche, what they do for the ballclub, what they feel
comfortable in doing. They won't feel like they have to play out of
character. I think everything, you know, will fall into place, slowly
but surely."</TE>
<TE>   So slowly, perhaps, that Jackson refused to consider the fact
they'd perhaps reached the season's first significant marker.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll talk about that later," he said. "I can't anticipate that's
going to be any easier. Chicago beat us last year.... We anticipate
Milwaukee [on Sunday] is going to be tough. I mean, we just do not
have an easy road ahead of us, where everything's going to fall into
place and turn around."</TE>
<TE>   But they can hope. O'Neal left their locker room with a smile, and
with a plan to play Friday night, and so his teammates could hope
too.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we see him on the court, that's the feeling everybody will
have inside," Brian Shaw said. "Until then, we have to get to the
point where we see brighter days. Right now, it's no fun at all. No
fun at all."</TE>

<HD>Celtics Beat Nets With Little Fanfare</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Any excitement the Boston Celtics might have felt after beating New
Jersey was tempered by the knowledge that it wasn't the victory they
wanted.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't mean nothing," Celtic guard Paul Pierce said Wednesday
night after Boston beat the visiting Nets, 96-79, in a rematch of
last season's Eastern Conference finals. "This game doesn't put us
into the NBA Finals. It's a regular-season game, and we play Atlanta
on Friday."</LD>
<LD>   Tony Delk and Shammond Williams each scored 21 points -- the first
time this season that neither Pierce nor Antoine Walker led the
Celtics in scoring. Pierce had 18 points and 13 rebounds, and Walker
scored 16 points to help the Celtics end a two-game skid.</LD>
<TE>   The game lacked the drama of last season's playoff series, when
the Nets bristled at Boston's behavior after their 26-point collapse
in Game 3. Taunts directed toward Jason Kidd's wife and son by Celtic
fans brought emotions to the boiling point before the Nets won in six
games and advanced to the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Although the teams are again near the top of the conference
standings, neither put much importance on the early-season meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "The rivalry started in the playoffs," said Kidd, who scored 19
points, "and it will have to continue in the playoffs, not the
regular season."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 97, Toronto 95 -- Al Harrington scored 16 of his 22 points
in the second half at Toronto and the Pacers tied their
franchise-best start at 9-1, matching the 1969-70 team in the old
ABA.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine O'Neal scored 20 points for the Pacers, who have won
eight in a row since losing at New Jersey on Nov. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 79, Miami 68 -- Ben Wallace had 19 rebounds, a season-best
12 points and tied Edgar Jones' franchise record with 10 blocked
shots to lead the Pistons at Auburn Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Miami failed to reach 70 points for the second time in three
games.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 103, Atlanta 93 -- Troy Hudson scored 20 points at
Atlanta and the Timberwolves survived an off night by Kevin Garnett.</TE>
<TE>   Garnett scored 15 points on five-for-19 shooting, but had a
game-high 12 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who beat the Hawks for
the sixth consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 96, Denver 79 -- Karl Malone scored 21 points, including 16
in the second half, at Denver and the Jazz handed the Nuggets their
fifth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Leading, 53-41, at halftime, the Jazz took control with a 12-3 run
-- including eight consecutive points -- to open the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 98, Orlando 84 -- Rasheed Wallace had 26 points and 14
rebounds, and Derek Anderson scored 26 points at Portland, Ore., as
the Trail Blazers won consecutive games for the first time this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando's Tracy McGrady led all scorers with 33 points, the
seventh consecutive game he has scored at least 30 points -- a
franchise record and the ninth time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 100, Chicago 94 -- Antawn Jamison scored 25 points at
Oakland and the Warriors withstood a second-half scoring spree by
Jalen Rose, who scored 26 of his 34 points in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 95, Memphis 88 -- Allen Iverson scored 33 points at
Memphis, Tenn., and the 76ers kept the Grizzlies (0-12) as the
league's only team without a victory.</TE>
<TE>   Stromile Swift set a Memphis record with eight blocked shots. He
had 12 points and 16 rebounds.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Kings Return to Their Court of Screams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ah, Your Majesties, back for more?</LD>
<LD>   Into their personal dome of doom strode the Sacramento Kings
Wednesday night, returning officially to Staples Center for the first
time since last spring's West finals, which they led, 2-1, with a
20-point lead in Game 4 here ... before the Lakers rallied, capped by
Robert Horry's buzzer-beating three-pointer.</LD>
<LD>   Then there was Game 6 here, when the Lakers shot 27 free throws in
the fourth quarter of a 106-102 victory, sending the Kings back to
Sacramento for Game 7, talking to themselves.</LD>
<TE>   Unofficially, the Kings were back here for an exhibition game but
that didn't go so well, either, with Rick Fox trying to resume his
fight with Doug Christie in a hallway.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night, there was no Fox in the hallway ... or Horry
lurking at the top of the key ... or Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe Bryant
... just the Clippers, and it isn't the same.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers played hard and well and the Kings came from 10
points behind in the second half and beat them, anyway, 93-89.</TE>
<TE>   In case you hadn't noticed, it's a new season. The Kings are now
in a virtual tie with Seattle for first place in the Pacific. The
Clippers are 4 1/2 games behind. The Lakers are 5 1/2 behind.</TE>
<TE>   "With the challenge the Kings put forth last year, I've got to
think they feel they can beat any team in the league," said Clipper
Coach Alvin Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   "But the other thing, the flip side of that is, they had a chance
to close the Lakers out and they didn't so I don't know what kind of
effect that's going to have on them, if they get into a series with
the Lakers again.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a chance to go back to Sacramento up, 3-1, and Robert
Horry's shot just kind of changed the whole series. But that team
seems to be a really confident team. They've got a maturity level
about them, with Vlade [Divac] and those guys, I think they can wipe
what happened last year away. But until somebody beats them, the
Lakers are still the champs....</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's done that yet. It doesn't matter, 'Oh, we got robbed,'
and anything like that. The bottom line is that the Lakers got
another ring that they put on this year."</TE>
<TE>   It's true, King Coach Rick Adelman did mention those 27 free
throws a few times after last season's series was concluded but these
days, the Kings are OK, with their history, or planning on changing
theirs.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely remember being right here in this same locker," said
Chris Webber before the game. "Just being real disappointed, the most
I've ever been in my pro career.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's the painful memory. Hopefully, I can change that
memory into something else."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers hit them with everything they had Wednesday night,
coming from 10 points down in the first half as Keyon Dooling lit up
defensive ace Bobby Jackson, storming into a 10-point lead in the
third quarter as Michael Olowokandi started rejecting shots by Webber
and Divac, one after another.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Kings eased past them in the fourth quarter,
like the old pros they are, matched against kids, which the Clippers
are.</TE>
<TE>   "I see a great, young, awesome team," said Webber, "especially if
they had kept [Darius] Miles and still got Andre Miller, like they
could have done on draft day.</TE>
<TE>   "I also see potentially no team at all and I think that's how the
NBA looks at it. I think a lot of people look at it as a chance for
something great but we'll see how long it lasts here.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it lasts because I was on a young team when it wasn't
fashionable. I was on a young team in Washington. If we had been able
to stay together the team that we had -- Rasheed Wallace, myself,
Juwan Howard. They could have traded for a young [Latrell] Sprewell
at that time for Calbert Cheaney.</TE>
<TE>   "It just wasn't cool to be a young team in the eyes of management
when we all wanted to win. We had 12 guys that wanted to win, we
hated losing just like it was college, we supported each other. It
was a family atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm blessed to be in this situation where it's the same thing,
with veterans, but this doesn't come around often. So I just hope for
the community, especially all of the Clippers fans who come to the
games and are just here waiting for something good to happen, that
they stick together because this is a real good situation. I mean,
there are some good guys on this team."</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, there are, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings will be back Christmas Day when Fox, Horry and Shaq will
be here to greet them. The season may be new but that rivalry feels
as if it has been going for centuries.</TE>

<LD>Steve Smith, Carolina's leading receiver, was suspended Wednesday for
one game by the Panthers after a fight that sent teammate Anthony
Bright to a hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Bright's nose was broken in the altercation, which came during
Monday's film session, the Panthers said.</LD>
<LD>   Smith's suspension came on the same day the Panthers released
offensive tackle Chris Terry, who was arrested for failing to appear
in court on a misdemeanor charge of assaulting his wife.</LD>
<TE>   Receiver Isaac Byrd visited Bright, a practice squad player, in
the hospital Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The nose was covered. Half the face was swollen and his left eye
was closed," Byrd said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith issued a statement apologizing to Bright and the rest of the
team.</TE>

<HD>Fox Puts Imprint on Augusta Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For those who figured Augusta National Golf Club would admit a female
member before Martha Burk appeared on the "Best Damn Sports Show
Period," you guessed wrong.</LD>
<LD>   It was a fleeting appearance, conducted via remote Wednesday, and
a bizarre one, conducted on a show whose coverage of women's issues
normally begins and ends with Tom Arnold leering at Lisa Guerrero's
legs.</LD>
<LD>   But no doubt about it, that was Burk, president of the National
Council of Women's Organizations, arguing her case for inclusion in
America's most prestigious golf club for a few minutes before Arnold
and the gang could exhale and move on to the finger-wrestling
highlights from Germany.</LD>
<TE>   What next -- Hootie Johnson's rebuttal, tomorrow, on "The View"?</TE>
<TE>   Then again, when you ponder it a bit, Burk on the "Best Damn
Sports Show" makes sense, seeing as how these things tend to happen
in threes.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times editorial page already had weighed in on the
women-at-Augusta issue.</TE>
<TE>   So had Jesse Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, it was time to get John Kruk's perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Burk, who holds a PhD in psychology, is a shrewd campaigner. She
knows she's preaching to the choir when she appears on PBS or writes
for The Nation. This public-relations war over who belongs and who
doesn't at Augusta has turned nasty, and it's not going to be won on
the high road, but in the gutter. That's where Fox comes in.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, the chairman of Augusta National, isn't playing fair.
After this issue seemed to be simmering on a backburner, Johnson
caught wind of some mild dissent within the ranks and determined he
had better quash it and quash it loudly. So Hootie carefully devised
his game plan:</TE>
<TE>   Alert the media!</TE>
<TE>   (But not all of them. Those critters are pesky! If only they'd let
us poison their pimento cheese sandwiches, but, dadgum it, the
marshal says we can't be doin' that.)</TE>
<TE>   Hootie's plan was to hand-pick a few influential publications and
invite them to fly in a reporter for a personal one-on-one spin
session with the big guy, provided the interview stayed well within
the bounds of a very narrow fairway and the result would not be
published until a mutually agreed-upon date.</TE>
<TE>   Hootie fired his salvo, which was to repeat: The old boys are
united -- no girls allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, Burk has been on the counterattack. She finds herself
trying to win over two tough constituencies. Wednesday, Burk decided
that since she's not getting anywhere with Hootie, she might as well
take her case to the blowhards.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, most of the blowhards were on the bench when Burk's
face flashed across the split screen for her debate with Renee
Giachino, senior vice president for the Center for Individual
Freedom. Coach's decision. This was a serious issue, deserving of
thoughtful, intelligent consideration.</TE>
<TE>   If you're running this show, are you going to let Arnold or
Michael Irvin anywhere near it?</TE>
<TE>   You never know with Fox. In an upset, they sent Arnold, Irvin and
John Salley to the sideline, off camera, but figured they couldn't
shove host Chris Rose out there by himself. They decided they needed
someone with him for emotional support, someone who could ask a
serious question, or at least read one off a TelePrompTer.</TE>
<TE>   Working with a very thin roster, they opted to go with the best
athlete available, Kruk.</TE>
<TE>   First, of course, the issue had to be taken down to the show's
usual playing level.</TE>
<TE>   "Still to come," the promo teased, "we'll get the true story
behind Augusta-GATE! The leading women behind the controversy TELL
ALL!"</TE>
<TE>   With or without a wrestling tub filled with lime Jell-O? Until the
end of the commercial break, who could know for sure?</TE>
<TE>   Burk and Giachino appeared on the split screen, apparently fully
clothed, and politely laid out both sides of the argument. Burk said
she has no quarrel with Tiger Woods, who to this point has declined
to take up the New York Times on its suggestion he boycott next
year's Masters. "Our quarrel is with Augusta National Golf Club," she
said. "They're the one doing the discriminating."</TE>
<TE>   An eerie, uneasy hush fell over the panel and studio audience.</TE>
<TE>   Please! Somebody tell a Manute Bol joke!</TE>
<TE>   It was quiet. Too quiet. Until Giachino began to argue that "the
First Amendment and freedom of association is color-blind. It does
not choose among religions, it does not choose among sex, it does not
choose between short, tall, fat or thin."</TE>
<TE>   Burk: "Well, Renee, I think you need to go bone up on your law a
little bit...."</TE>
<TE>   Studio audience: "Oooooohhhh!"</TE>
<TE>   What was this? Graduate-degree trash talk? Bring it on!</TE>
<TE>   That, however, was as heated as the exchange got. With attention
spans running on empty, Rose quickly brought the debate to a close
and thanked the women for their time.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, look, Krukkie," Rose said. "Right or wrong, whatever side
you want to get on, it'll be interesting to see what sort of measures
are taken next April."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," Krukkie replied, "April is going to be a fun month to
watch when the Masters starts rolling around to see what is going to
be done at the tournament and what's going to be done after the
tournament. Are they going to allow a female member?"</TE>
<TE>   While we pondered the weighty ramifications, the "Best Damn Sports
Show" had to run. It had wandered outside its comfort zone for far
too long.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, how about those basketball-playing elephants in Thailand?</TE>

<HD>Pick-Six Figure Pleads Guilty</HD>
<DH>Computer programmer may testify against co-defendants in
the Breeders' Cup scandal. He also reveals a second plot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A computer programmer who helped create more than $3 million in bogus
winnings at this year's Breeders' Cup pleaded guilty Wednesday to
fraud and money-laundering charges, and revealed a second plot
involving counterfeit tickets at five other racetracks.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Harn, 29, implicated two of his college fraternity
brothers, who have also been charged in the Breeders' Cup scheme.
Harn was employed as a senior programmer at Autotote Systems Inc.,
which processes many of the bets placed on horse races in North
America.</LD>
<LD>   His confession in federal court raised the possibility that he was
preparing to testify against co-defendants Derrick Davis and Glen
DaSilva, who are also 29.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Magistrate Judge Lisa Margaret Smith announced in court that
prosecutors had reached an "understanding" with Harn that would
result in a sentence lighter than the maximum of 25 years and
$750,000 in fines. The terms were not disclosed, but such agreements
frequently are a prelude to a defendant becoming a prosecution
witness.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court in White Plains, N.Y., Edward Hayes, a lawyer for
DaSilva, attacked the plea agreement. "This is like making a deal
with an ax murderer to testify against the ax," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The defense lawyer said discussions also took place with
prosecutors about DaSilva entering a guilty plea and testifying, but
that DaSilva had declined.</TE>
<TE>   Harn had no comment after his 40-minute court appearance. But his
lawyer, Daniel Conti, said his client "has accepted fully the
responsibility for the crimes he has committed."</TE>
<TE>   Almost simultaneously in Manhattan, a coalition of racing
associations announced it had hired former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
to oversee a "systematic examination of certain kinds of wagers made
over the course of the last year" and to strengthen computer
security.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Smith, commissioner of the National Thoroughbred Racing Assn.,
said at a news conference with Giuliani that he was not aware of
other betting frauds in addition to those revealed.</TE>
<TE>   But he warned: "Last month's incident involving the Breeders' Cup
pick six was a loud wake-up call for our entire industry."</TE>
<TE>   Said Giuliani: "This is going to be a wide-open investigation. We
will apply very high standards to try to come up with a system that
is as foolproof as it can be and as state of the art as it can be."</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor estimated it could take up to a year to examine
betting records to determine whether any other crimes occurred and
"to devise a system that builds in the highest level of security that
is possible."</TE>
<TE>   The alleged conspiracy at the Breeders' Cup has been called one of
the biggest frauds in racing history. Prosecutors say the defendants
manipulated computers to create winning pick-six tickets after the
first four races were finished.</TE>
<TE>   Pick-six winners correctly select the horse that finishes first in
six consecutive races.</TE>
<TE>   The payoff can be enormous. In the Breeders' Cup, held Oct. 26 at
Arlington Park outside Chicago, the bogus bets paid $3,067,821 --
money that has been withheld.</TE>
<TE>   Court papers made public Wednesday charged that the three former
Drexel University fraternity brothers also participated in a scheme
to cash in bogus winning tickets at other tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors charged that Harn worked after hours to print
thousands of the winning tickets. While no specific figure was given
for this scheme, the documents charged that the counterfeit
duplicates created by Harn "varied in amounts ranging between several
hundred dollars and several thousand dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Harn admitted providing tens of thousands of dollars' worth of
bogus tickets to Davis and DaSilva, alleging that they cashed some of
them at Aqueduct and Belmont Park in New York, Monmouth Park and the
Meadowlands in New Jersey, and Philadelphia Park in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   "After redeeming the duplicate winning tickets, Davis and DaSilva
divided the cash proceeds of those tickets with Harn," court papers
alleged.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times, Hayes portrayed Harn as the
"ringleader" of the plots.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever happened, it happened because Harn made it happen,"
Hayes charged. At the same time, he revealed some details of
DaSilva's discussions with prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to Harn's lawyer. I said, 'Look, they've offered my guy a
chance to testify.' But my guy doesn't want to," the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer said that DaSilva's decision to refuse the prosecutor's
offer was motivated by the three men's 10-year friendship, and the
fact that Harn has a 2-year-old daughter. Hayes said bitterly that
his client was surprised when Harn entered his plea.</TE>
<TE>   "They gave him a hell of a deal," the lawyer added. "Maybe he has
some special knowledge or he knows of other people who were involved.
I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   James B. Comey, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New
York, labeled Harn's confession in court "a significant step forward
in restoring the confidence that honest people should have in the
integrity of the race-wagering system."</TE>

<KH>Diane Pucin/ THE RIVALRY USC vs. UCLA</KH>
<HD>Spirit of Troy</HD>
<DH>To avoid trouble in streets of Santa Ana, Polamalu showed
staying power as a youth in Oregon</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TENMILE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>When 8-year-old Troy Polamalu tugged on his Uncle Salu's leg, when he
stared into his Aunt Shelley's eyes, when he asked, pleaded, begged,
to stay here in the house on the creek with his cousins Joe, Brandon
and Darren and to leave behind Santa Ana and the gangs and the drugs
and the trouble that had tempted his older brother and sisters,
nobody expected this.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody expected the little boy to stay for good. Nobody expected
Troy and his wild hair to slip into Tenmile Elementary, as unnoticed
as possible considering he was Samoan in a place where, as Principal
Guy Hankins says, about one in every 100 students is an ethnic
minority "and most of those don't stay very long."</LD>
<LD>   Nobody really expected Troy to obey the rules of Salu, who was a
Samoan fire dancer until he met Shelley, the girl from Oregon, when
Salu was dancing at Don Ho's Hawaii hotel. Salu told Troy that all
household rules had to be observed and good grades had to be earned.
"Or else," Salu says, "I told Troy he would be on a bus to Santa Ana
pronto."</LD>
<TE>   And surely nobody expected that now, when Troy is the latest USC
All-American, a senior strong safety, a candidate for several
postseason awards, a likely high-round NFL draft pick, there would be
a sandwich named after him at the Munch Box in Winston, Ore., or a
poster of him in the window of nearly every diner, convenience store,
school and church in this beautiful valley about 200 miles southwest
of Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody could have imagined how Polamalu grabbed the hearts of
everybody he met and didn't let go.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy had a wisdom beyond his age," says Joe LaFountaine,
principal at Douglas High. "He had an old spirit in a young body."</TE>
<TE>   This was a 10-year-old LaFountaine was describing.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way it's a shame," LaFountaine says, "that our kids in high
school now know Troy by name and for his football instead of by his
spirit."</TE>
<TE>   "Troy's legacy is not football," says Ted Martch, coordinator of
the Douglas school district's special education program. Polamalu
came to the special ed trailer out behind the woodshop nearly every
day for four years. His photo -- with the mentally disabled children
who never knew Troy as the sports star, as the prom king, as the
honor roll student but only as the nice guy who came and played with
them every day -- is on every wall.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy's legacy is far greater than that. Troy's legacy is his kind
heart," Martch says.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Anderson, the woodshop teacher who was awed by Polamalu's
talent in his class and who became Troy's favorite teacher, says, "We
had a coach here whose motto was 'Do Right.' Troy lived by that
motto.</TE>
<TE>   "When Troy was graduating, he came by and told me that if he ever
signed a pro contract that he was going to build me a woodshop in his
home and that I could come and live there. And I know Troy would do
that."</TE>
<TE>   There are more of these tributes to Troy. They come from teachers
and coaches, aunts and uncles. Polamalu's former baseball coach and
athletic director, Rod Trask, drove 70 miles after school from his
new home and new school to have pizza and talk about Troy.</TE>
<TE>   But first must come the story of Polamalu's family.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Suila, tried to raise five children alone in Santa Ana
after Troy's father had left. Kaio, the oldest boy, was athletically
talented but also drawn to the street life. Troy, who used to pretend
he was Walter Payton and have Kaio and his uncle, Kennedy Pola, turn
a hose on the dirt outside the house so Troy could pretend he was
running on muddy Soldier Field, noticed as Kaio was tempted by drugs
and would come home with the tattoos of gangs on his arms. He saw his
sisters drop out of high school.</TE>
<TE>   Who would think an 8-year-old boy would see this and understand?</TE>
<TE>   "But he did," Shelley says. "This little boy came to us and he
knew what he wanted and what he didn't want."</TE>
<TE>   When Suila brought Troy to Tenmile in 1990 it was for a two-week
vacation at the creekside house where wild turkeys settle into the
trees and deer walk up to the deck and salmon swim by. But instead of
going home with Suila, Troy asked to stay. Troy meant forever. Suila,
Shelley and Salu decided it would be until Labor Day.</TE>
<TE>   But Labor Day came and Suila couldn't come up to get him. So
Shelley sent him off to school. "Troy was only going to be a guest,"
Shelley says, "but after a week they told me he had to enroll or he
couldn't stay. So we enrolled him and told Suila he could stay until
Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Suila came north at Christmas, but when it was time to leave, Troy
cried. "He grabbed my leg and begged me to let him stay," says Billie
Redenius, Shelley's mother and the woman Troy calls "Grandma."</TE>
<TE>   So Troy stayed. Again. He would finish out the school year, it was
agreed, and then he would go home. When school ended, Salu and
Shelley packed up the boys and took the camper to Santa Ana. There
were trips to Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, all the tourist things.
Troy went home to Suila every night. On the day Salu and Shelley were
going to head home, they went to say goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy was sitting on his front steps," Shelley says, "and there
were these big, fat tears rolling down his cheeks. Salu and I looked
at each other and said, 'I guess he's coming with us for good.' "</TE>
<TE>   It was, Troy says now, a blessing. "I honor my mother for letting
me go because it would be best for me," he says, "and I honor my aunt
and uncle for taking me in and giving me the home I needed."</TE>
<TE>   Officially a resident of Tenmile, Polamalu was ready to do
everything.</TE>
<TE>   He played every sport possible and was good at all of them. Soccer
was first and though he had never played, Troy took one look at the
game and the ball and began dribbling down the field, weaving in and
out among the other kids. When he was in seventh grade and his older
brothers were short a player for a pickup basketball game and all
their other friends were unavailable, Troy received a grudging
invitation. "We have to use you," they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Practically the first time he touched the ball," Joe says, "Troy
dribbled right through the middle of everybody and dunked the ball.
These were high school guys. Their mouths hung open."</TE>
<TE>   Neil Fuller, Troy's high school football coach, remembers the
130-pound rookie taking aim at a receiver who had caught the ball
over the middle. "Troy absolutely laid him out," Fuller says, "on a
totally textbook, clean hit, the hardest hit we had ever seen. And
the ref throws a flag. I run out and ask why and the ref says, 'He
hit the kid too hard. It was just too hard. You can't hit that hard.'
I'm screaming that you can't throw a flag for hitting too hard,
where's that in the rule book and telling this guy, 'The soccer field
is over there.' But that's Troy. He does everything full out."</TE>
<TE>   But Polamalu was making his life important in many other arenas.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley has scrapbooks full of newspaper stories of athletic
achievement, but more than that were the honor roll awards and good
citizen plaudits.</TE>
<TE>   His high school counselor, Shelley Hankins, recounts how Troy
happily played basketball with her daughter, Grace. "He was in the
fifth grade and told me that Grace was one of his top 10 girls,"
Hankins says. "I don't think Troy knew 10 girls."</TE>
<TE>   A good heart. A sweet spirit. A beautiful soul.</TE>
<TE>   That's what they say about Troy in Tenmile and Winston.</TE>
<TE>   In the house on Strickland Canyon Road, just a mile or so from the
post office, just past the Tenmile grade school and the Tenmile
Church, where all the boys went to bible study, what they say about
Troy is even more important.</TE>
<TE>   Salu's eyes fill with tears as he looks into the hills where
Brandon shot a five-point elk. "Am I proud of Troy? I am so proud of
Troy. He tells me, 'Uncle, I thank you for helping me.' But I have to
say, 'Troy, thank you for coming to us.' "</TE>
<TE>   Troy calls Joe, Brandon and Darren his brothers. He is proud of
Kaio, who straightened out his life, played football at Texas El Paso
and now teaches and coaches at Santa Ana High. His sisters, Patricia,
Sheila and Lupe, stay in touch and sometimes come to his games.
Suila, who remarried and moved back to Samoa after Troy came to
Oregon, has returned to see Troy play his final two college games.</TE>
<TE>   His uncle Kennedy, one of Salu and Suila's eight brothers and
sisters, is an assistant coach at USC. Another uncle, Al, played
football at Penn State. The family is spread out, but Troy loves them
all.</TE>
<TE>   But those who know Troy best are Joe, who played football at
Oregon State, who got his master's degree in counseling and who now
works at Douglas High; Darren, who is finishing his degree in history
and playing rugby at Oregon and who hopes to be a teacher, and
Brandon, who writes poetry and has a love of language and learning.</TE>
<TE>   They all, at separate moments, tell of the time, when Troy was 9
or 10 and was skating on his rollerblades. The driveway slanted
downhill and went from asphalt into gravel. Troy drew a line far down
the driveway and told his brothers he could jump that line.</TE>
<TE>   "No way, we all thought," Darren says. "But there goes Troy,
getting up this tremendous amount of speed, he jumps way up, as far
as he can, he's just flying, and he lands flat out, on his belly, on
that gravel. His little lower lip is quivering but he doesn't cry.
And, sure enough, he's just over the line. That's Troy. Whatever he
says he will do, he will do."</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu is not your typical big-time college athlete, Shelley
says. He didn't get his driver's license until after he graduated
from high school and has never had a car. Even now, she says, Troy
rides his bike everywhere. He has no cell phone, no tattoos, no
earrings.</TE>
<TE>   "At an early age, Troy never possessed any material things long
enough for them to gain sentimental value," Brandon wrote about what
he found special about Troy. "Later, when possessions did become more
abundant, instead of having a 'Get all I can before someone else
does' attitude, Troy found strength in his needlessness for material
possessions. Since I have known Troy, I have seen possessions flow
into and out of his hands. But if he does not keep things, where do
they go?</TE>
<TE>   "Just ask anyone who has ever been around Troy and I can almost
guarantee they have something that was once his."</TE>
<TE>   Troy's room in Tenmile is small. It is filled with paintings and
plaques in the language and style of Samoa. The end tables Troy made
in woodshop. And hanging from the ceiling, its neck in a noose, is a
little Bruin bear wearing a UCLA sweater. This is, after all, still
the space of a Trojan football player named Troy. A football player,
but not only a football player.</TE>

<HD>Breeders' Cup Scheme Joins Annals of Infamy</HD>
<DH>Horse racing has long inspired con artistry, the latest
scandal being merely a high-tech variation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Breeders' Cup Three didn't bribe jockeys, a la Tony Ciulla and
Richie Sklar. They didn't run a ringer like Mark Gerard. They didn't
kite checks like Eugene Zeek. They didn't ride out of the fog like
Sylvester Carmouche Jr. And they certainly didn't paint -- yes, paint
-- horses like Paddie Barrie.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Breeders' Cup Three have been charged with blazing an
infamous trail last month, hatching a $3-million payoff after
submitting a doctored ticket following the running of the first four
races in the pick six, their high-tech coup was really only a
computerized refinement of what has been pecking away at racing's
soul since the Romans, circling Circus Maximus with their chariots.</LD>
<LD>   One of the Breeders' Cup suspects, the fired tote-company
programmer Chris Harn of Newark, Del., pleaded guilty Wednesday in
U.S. District Court in New York to single charges of wire-fraud
conspiracy and money-laundering conspiracy. At a hearing, Harn
implicated Derrick Davis and Glen DaSilva, who were charged earlier
in the case.</LD>
<TE>   Racing's sporadic flimflams are inevitably greeted in two ways by
racing's pooh-bahs: indignation, followed by knee-jerk reform. At
Agua Caliente in Tijuana, in the days before tote machines, bets made
out by hand were time-stamped to ostensibly preserve their integrity.
But it was no secret that a few insiders could still time-stamp a
partially completed ticket, then fill in the numbers of the winning
horses afterward. So in Northern California, with much fanfare in
1934, Bay Meadows introduced a new totalisator system. "Totalisators
have been in use in America less than four years," the track said,
"and the one at Bay Meadows will be the first one on the West Coast.
It is a marvel of electric mechanism, with almost human intelligence,
and it will leave no room for doubt."</TE>
<TE>   The Daily Racing Form headline: "Human Equation Removed." Almost
70 years later, at the Autotote nerve center in Newark, Del., a
reported 18 employees knew the password that would let them tap into
the computer system, and on Oct. 26 it took only one -- the
29-year-old Harn -- to re-create a ticket and perpetrate what has
been called racing's most damaging scam. Because of the money they
allegedly hoped to collect, the Breeders' Cup Three are making all
the rogues that went before them look like pikers.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Mark Gerard risked his reputation as a
distinguished veterinarian for a pittance. Some scams play on
sympathetic heartstrings -- a trainer at Santa Anita who hates
computers even had a kind word for the Breeders' Cup trio -- but
there was nothing likable about Gerard, who signed off on a $137,000
insurance claim although he knew Lloyd's of London was erroneously
paying on the death of a sore-backed bleeder instead of a Uruguayan
champion.</TE>
<TE>   Gerard, who had treated stars such as Secretariat and Canonero II
in building up a $200,000-a-year practice, then ran the good horse,
the estimable Cinzano, in the name of the pitiable no-account, Lebon,
on a fall 1977 day at Belmont Park, and cashed a $78,000 bet when the
ringer rolled in at 57-1.</TE>
<TE>   Two things unraveled Gerard's hefty payday. The race was the last
of the day, and the vet figured he could go to the mutuel windows,
quickly collect his haul and walk away unnoticed. But the cashier,
short of the full $78,000, sent a part-time runner down the line for
more cash. The runner happened to gallop horses in the mornings at
Belmont, and recognized Gerard upon his return. "Hi, Doc," he said
casually. "Nice hit."</TE>
<TE>   A little later, a winner's circle picture of "Lebon," the rank
longshot, was published in South American newspapers. Cinzano and
Lebon were both bays, but Cinzano, unlike Lebon, had a white star on
his forehead, which was clearly visible in the photograph. A call
from South America to U.S. racing authorities led to an investigation
and the prosecution of Gerard. Represented by F. Lee Bailey, Gerard
was convicted and sentenced to one year in prison. One of the appeals
court judges, while rejecting Gerard's request for leniency, said
that the case "might have been authored jointly by Alfred Hitchcock
and Damon Runyon."</TE>
<TE>   Paddie Barrie was as Runyonesque as they come. A man of many
aliases, the English-born Barrie came to the U.S. illegally from
Canada, to become known as the "Racetrack Rembrandt." If you needed a
bay to masquerade as a chestnut, Barrie was your man. He did such
good work -- using the best of henna dyes -- that trainers didn't
have to worry about the color running in the rain.</TE>
<TE>   One of Barrie's favorite chattels was Aknahton, a horse that
frequently ran in any name but his own. In 1931, Barrie painted
Aknahton to look like a horse named Shem and ran him at Havre de
Grace in Maryland. Instead of going off as a longshot, the horse won
at 5-1 and Barrie and his confederates made a nice score. By the time
the authorities picked up the scent, Barrie, Aknahton and the others
were off for another try.</TE>
<TE>   Aknahton and Barrie showed up at a fair in York, Pa., in 1933. In
the official track program, Aknahton was called Chinese Puzzle. The
horse won again, but in 1934 Barrie was caught and deported. "Barrie,
one of the greatest of horse painters, has been in and out of the
country many times in recent years," the Racing Form reported, "never
bothering about a passport or the immigration authorities.
Furthermore, he has been exceedingly active pursuing his favorite
calling, according to his own admission, although the valiant
Pinkertons were busily engaged looking for him all the while. He
probably would be on the loose today, but one of his accomplices
spoke out of turn."</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Zeek, another flamboyant character, trained horses at
Eastern tracks, including Laurel Park, Penn National and Liberty Bell
Park. Zeek's money-making scheme was hardly intricate: He cashed
worthless checks at the tracks, duped a New Jersey banker into aiding
him, and by the time the tracks awoke, Zeek was thousands of miles
away, on an isle in the West Indies that had no extradition treaty
with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   As a performance artist, Zeek qualified. To give the victimized
tracks a sense of security, he purposely moved some bad paper, worth
thousands of dollars, and when they questioned the absence of funds,
Zeek would reach into his pockets, produce a wad of bills and make
good on the spot. By New Year's Eve 1973, however, Zeek was no longer
around to chase, and the tracks were holding more than $1 million in
bad checks. A private plane had taken him, two other men and a woman
to the island of Grenada.</TE>
<TE>   Zeek's money ran out along with his welcome, which ended during a
government overthrow four years later. He returned to the U.S. to
serve his time.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Zeek was at least 6 feet 3 and weighed well over 200
pounds, but he still would have been dwarfed by Tony Ciulla, who was
just as tall and weighed close to 350. Ciulla admitted fixing
hundreds of races at dozens of Eastern tracks in the 1970s, bribing
jockeys for as much as $10,000 a race. He eventually testified before
a U.S. grand jury in Detroit (leading to indictments of two jockeys
and a trainer), and was given a new identity before moving to
California.</TE>
<TE>   Ciulla in a hotel room with a reluctant but cornered jockey was
once described as a classic mismatch. He bragged that he could get to
just about all of the riders, listing Ron Turcotte -- Secretariat's
jockey -- and Michael Hole as the exceptions. Hole was found near a
Long Island beach, dead by asphyxiation. His family and friends have
long doubted that he committed suicide. Turcotte was paralyzed in a
1978 racing accident at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, Ciulla, living in Santa Barbara, would call
regularly. The serial race-fixers seem to have this need to
reminisce, just as Richie "Richie Fingers" Sklar wanted to do this
week. In March 1998, Ciulla's phone was cut off and a note to him
came back with no forwarding address. A few weeks before, he had
mentioned some waterfront property in Singapore that needed tending.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been off our [radar] screen as well," Paul Berube, president
of the Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau in Maryland, said
recently. "But you always have the feeling that guys like him never
really go out of the business. They're drawn to the element they've
always known, and the element to them."</TE>
<TE>   Sklar, convicted of bribing jockeys to hold back horses in two
Arabian races and one for thoroughbreds at Los Alamitos, served a
six-month federal sentence in 1998. He says that his activities were
much broader than that -- 80 jockeys, every track in California and a
couple out of state -- but track executives dismiss his tales as
incurable braggadocio.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, Sklar told a story of a fixed race that went awry
with jockey Ron Hansen at one of the Northern California tracks.
Hansen was a premier rider at Bay Meadows and Golden Gate Fields, but
upon his death near the San Mateo Bridge in 1993, rumors swirled that
alleged race-fixing had led to foul play. Because Hansen had been
missing for 3 1/2 months before his badly decomposed remains were
discovered in January 1994, a coroner was unable to determine the
cause of death.</TE>
<TE>   During a brief period in the early 1990s when there was a
pick-seven bet, Sklar said that between him and Hansen, they had most
of the races tied up. With a carryover, there was a pool of more than
$1.5 million, and Hansen was to share 15% of the proceeds from
Sklar's ticket, which cost $38,000.</TE>
<TE>   In the first race, Hansen's role was to get his horse beat. But
the favorite broke down on the far turn, and at the 16th pole
Hansen's mount, which was the 5-2 second choice, was four lengths in
front with no one challenging.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked around, and got sick," Sklar quotes Hansen as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, near the wire, another horse came up to Hansen's but
wasn't going to win. Deliberately whipping left-handed, Hansen was
able to force his horse into lugging out, into his rival's path. As
the stewards flashed the inquiry sign, Hansen was confident his
winning mount would be disqualified for interference. He gladly
admitted culpability to them on the phone near the winner's circle.</TE>
<TE>   But the stewards let Hansen's number stand. The four winning
tickets -- none of them Sklar's -- on the pick seven paid about
$400,000 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the toughest beat I've ever taken," Hansen said later,
according to Sklar.</TE>
<TE>   These are the stories that make racing leaders blanch, and
sometimes even the positive stories can take on a reverse spin. A
16-race winning streak by the Louisiana filly Hollowed Dreams in
1999-2000 was marred by the fact that two of her jockeys were
carrying scam baggage.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Patin, who rode Hallowed Dreams to her first stakes win, was
unable to ride the filly again because of the start of a five-year
suspension resulting from the Arkansas Derby in 1999. Patin's winning
mount in the $500,000 race at Oaklawn Park, Valhol, was stripped of
the purse when stewards ruled that Patin had used an illegal
electrical prod, usually called a battery. Patin's replacement aboard
Hallowed Dreams, Sylvester Carmouche Jr., had served 8 1/2 years of a
10-year suspension before being reinstated in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   On a foggy January night at Delta Downs at 1990, nine horses broke
from the gate, but only eight could be seen as the field went past
the finish the first time. The missing horse, Carmouche's Landing
Officer, took a left-hand turn shortly after the start, then waited
in a heavy fog pocket for the others to circle the track and reach
the top of the stretch. Carmouche then kicked Landing Officer into
gear and, running only an eighth of a mile or so compared with a mile
for everyone else, they won by 24 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   "What I did was a spur-of-the-moment thing," Carmouche said after
he had ridden Hallowed Dreams to her 15th consecutive win. "I'm glad
this filly has given me a reason to talk about the good things."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's face it, USC figures to steamroller the Bruins on Saturday in
the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   The smart money in Las Vegas went down early on the Trojans, and
now the Bruins are getting four points instead of three in the hopes
the suckers will take UCLA. The Trojans are obviously the better
team, and everyone has known that since the start of the season.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins, who were picked to finish no better than sixth in the
Pacific 10 Conference with Cory Paus at quarterback, now have a pair
of freshmen alternating at the position, while the Trojans have this
fifth-year guy who is getting Heisman Trophy consideration. (I would
think you'd want to spend no more than four years at USC and get out
of there as soon as possible, but that's just me.)</LD>
<TE>   The Trojans are ranked No. 7 in the whole country, whipped the
Bruins, 27-0, last year and have the great Pete Carroll as coach.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have Bob Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ONLY thing that USC has yet to determine, of course, is the
final score. I would imagine the Trojans have something lopsided in
mind again.</TE>
<TE>   We already know they have chalked up the next two games against
UCLA and Notre Dame as victories. Earlier this week they sent two
associate athletic directors -- one to watch the other on the
school's expense account, I guess -- to talk with officials at the
Sugar Bowl in New Orleans and the Orange Bowl in Miami about which is
the better BCS opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   There's no way USC would authorize the expenditure for such a New
Orleans/Miami junket without the guarantee the team is going to
finish 10-2.</TE>
<TE>   I recall the Pittsburgh Steelers doing a similar thing in the 1994
season, recording a Super Bowl rap video and then being upset by the
Chargers in the AFC title game after San Diego took offense to being
written off prematurely. Jacksonville ran into the same problem,
doing a Super Bowl rap and then not making it to the big game in the
1999 season after Tennessee upset the Jaguars.</TE>
<TE>   But that's professional football, the Super Bowl and rap videos,
and this is different because USC already knows it's going to defeat
UCLA, and everyone knows that Notre Dame is the most overrated team
in the nation with only one loss. So the only thing up in the air at
this time is which is it going to be: New Year's in New Orleans or
Miami?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M SURE you had to be there, but Carroll's idea of asking an
assistant equipment manager to confront someone atop a parking
structure, appear to hit him and then throw a body over the wall in
an attempt to fool Trojan football players into thinking a UCLA spy
had been caught and destroyed is not funny. I've received some e-mail
from some crazed Trojan fans, who are probably wondering right now
why a dummy had to be used instead of a real person (sportswriter).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE LAKERS have a savior in Shaquille O'Neal, who is expected to
right all that is wrong with the defending champions when he returns
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, meanwhile, as Coach Alvin Gentry said Wednesday
night, "are on our own" when it comes to overcoming a shaky start.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the start of the season has been a big disappointment for
the players and the coaches as well," Gentry said, which is not good,
because he is in the final year of his contract and if the season
remains a big disappointment, it's probably all going to fall on him.</TE>
<TE>   Now I happen to be a huge fan of Gentry, which obviously dooms the
poor guy and certainly hurts his standing with USC fans, but his work
in putting the Clippers back on the front page with local fans has
been extraordinary. (The guy has Michael Olowokandi averaging more
than 16 points in his last 34 games, which certifies him a miracle
worker.)</TE>
<TE>   In fact he's probably to blame for the raised expectations that
threaten now to make him former coach of the Clippers if misfortune
continues to plague this team's roster. The Lakers have been unable
to cope with the loss of Shaq for the last 12 games, while Gentry has
been working without Lamar Odom now for the last 65 games.</TE>
<TE>   Training camp mishaps to Elton Brand, Olowokandi and Quentin
Richardson also ruined his chances of starting strong this season,
and now the battle to impress and survive is going to be that much
tougher.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously I'm concerned ... but I'm not going to change the way I
coach the team," Gentry said of his future. "The absolute worst thing
to do would be to coach out of desperation."</TE>
<TE>   I guess that makes him different from most of the Clipper coaches
who have preceded him. I hope he stays around, which really makes him
different from all those guys who have preceded him.</TE>

be played all the way on the other side of this country next season?</TE>

<TE>   JUST HOW bad a kicker is the 49ers' Jeff Chandler, the team's
fourth-round pick from Florida? To date he has been unable to beat
out Jose Cortez, and although he will kick in Cortez's place Monday
night, the 49ers are still hanging on to Cortez just in case.</TE>

<TE>   WORD IS the women's tennis tournament that had been in Manhattan
Beach and the MLS championship game are moving to Carson, joining the
Chargers, who will be conducting training camp there.</TE>

<HD>South Korea's Effort Impresses Brazilians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Urged on by a near-capacity crowd of 63,000 at the Seoul World Cup
Stadium, South Korea twice took the lead against world champion
Brazil, but in the end two goals by Ronaldo and one in the final
minute by Ronaldinho earned the South Americans a 3-2 victory in one
of a score of friendly internationals played Wednesday</LD>
<LD>   Chilled by the cold and rainy weather and surprised by the
Koreans' attacking performance, caretaker Coach Mario "Lobo"
Zagallo's Brazilians were left praising their hosts.</LD>
<LD>   "Whoever is going to play against the Korean team in the next
World Cup should prepare a lot," said Ronaldinho, who secured the win
with a 90th-minute penalty kick after a foul on Ronaldo.</LD>
<TE>   "They are a strong team," said Ronaldo, whose goals in the 16th
and 67th minutes canceled out those by South Korea's Seol Ki-Hyeon on
a header in the seventh and Ahn Jung-Hwan in the 58th.</TE>
<TE>   The match marked the final national team appearance of Korean
striker Hwang Sun-Hong and also of defender Hong Myung-Bo, who will
fly to Los Angeles today to join the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   "I am happy that it ended honorably," Hong said.</TE>
<TE>   A Dutch Treat</TE>
<TE>   The Netherlands made up in small measure for failing to qualify
for Korea/Japan '02 when it defeated World Cup runner-up Germany,
3-1, in front of 60,601 at Gelsenkirchen, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The teams were evenly matched in the first half, with Patrick
Kluivert giving the Dutch the lead after 22 minutes and Fredi Bobic,
playing his first game for Germany in more than five years, tying it
on a diving header 12 minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   The Netherlands' counter-attack proved the difference in the
second 45 minutes as Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Ruud van Nistelrooy
scored in the 69th and 79th minutes, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second half, we played much better and things went our
way," Van Nistelrooy said. "This is a fantastic result for us."</TE>
<TE>   Argentina Recovers</TE>
<TE>   Goals three minutes apart by midfielder Juan Pablo Sorin and
forward Hernan Crespo early in the second half earned Argentina a 2-0
victory over Japan in front of 40,931 at Saitama, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The match was the first for the South Americans since they were
eliminated in the first round at the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a difficult time for us, so for the team to come and
give a good performance like this was a very positive thing," Coach
Marcelo Bielsa said.</TE>
<TE>   And Elsewhere</TE>
<TE>   France extended its unbeaten run under Coach Jacques Santini to
five games as it shut out Yugoslavia, 3-0, at Saint-Denis on two
goals by Eric Carriere and one by Olivier Kapo.... Italy Coach
Giovanni Trapattoni gave four players their international debuts as
Italy and Turkey played to a 1-1 tie at Pescara, Italy, where two
Inter Milan players, Belozoglu Emre for Turkey and Christian Vieri
for Italy, provided the goals.... Portugal, host of the 2004 European
Championship, beat Scotland, 2-0, on a rain-drenched field in Braga,
Portugal, with Pauleta scoring twice.... Spain edged Bulgaria, 1-0,
at Granada on a 10th-minute goal by striker Jose Mari.... Goals by
Gary Speed and John Hartson helped Wales solidify its Euro 2004
chances with a 2-0 qualifying victory over Azerbaijan at Baku,
Azerbaijan.</TE>
<TE>   MLS Changes</TE>
<TE>   Major League Soccer announced changes to both its regular-season
and playoff formats for the 2003 season.</TE>
<TE>   The season will be extended by one month, running from April 5 to
Nov. 23, with each team playing 30 regular-season games, an increase
of two over 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The top four teams in each five-team conference will qualify for
the playoffs, which, in the first round, will be a home-and-home,
total-goals series.</TE>
<TE>   If the series is tied, it will be settled by overtime and, if
necessary, penalty kicks.</TE>
<TE>   The conference finals will be single games, at the home of the
higher-seeded teams.</TE>
<TE>   The All-Star game will be played July 26 or Aug. 2 at the Home

<TE>   Morocco Bids</TE>
<TE>   Morocco's soccer federation said that it has formally notified
FIFA of its intention to bid for the 2010 World Cup, which the world
soccer ruling body has said will be played on the African continent.</TE>
<TE>   Morocco has tried three times to stage the quadrennial world
championship, losing out to the United States in 1994, France in 1998
and Germany in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Cagliari Banned</TE>
<TE>   The Italian soccer league banned Serie B club Cagliari from using

<HD>Manhattan Beach Loses Tennis Tournament</HD>
<DH>After 21 years, the cozy WTA event will move to a larger
stadium in Carson, a coup for the new sports complex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The JPMorgan Chase Open, the cozy women's tennis tournament with a
neighborhood feel that has been in Manhattan Beach for the last 21
years, will be moving into a much larger home in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   It will be announced today that the WTA tournament is leaving
Manhattan Beach for the Home Depot Center in Carson, a result of
negotiations between IMG, which owns and operates the event, and
Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).</LD>
<LD>   Traditionally, the outdoor hard-court event at Manhattan Beach has
attracted a strong field because of its closeness in the schedule to
the U.S. Open.</LD>
<TE>   Five of the top 10 players in the world were in the draw in 2002,
and winners the last three years were Chanda Rubin, Lindsay Davenport
and Serena Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Dates for 2003 are Aug. 4-10.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement is for five years, with automatic renewal if certain
targets are met, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're married and plan to stay married for a while," said Eric
van Dillen, senior corporate vice president at IMG. "It took a while.
We wanted to make sure our title sponsor was OK with it. It was a
pretty big departure from a small boutique, a wonderful little club,
to something completely different.</TE>
<TE>   "With their U.S. Open package, and seeing what the USTA is trying
to do in pulling together the summer [series], they [JP- Morgan
Chase] saw the facility a little farther along the way than just a
hole in the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Leiweke, president and chief executive of AEG, said that
recent tours of the Carson facility fostered something of a
breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   AEG was also willing to make some changes in design and
construction to accommodate its new partners.</TE>
<TE>   "What changed all of their minds -- whether it be IMG or JPMorgan
Chase -- is when they walked through the facility," Leiweke said.</TE>
<TE>   "They all looked at each other and said, 'We get it.' When you see
8,000 permanent seats that are tight and compact and in a bowl, it's
a pretty extraordinary opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The Home Depot Center, a $130-million sports complex under
construction on the campus of Cal State Dominguez Hills, will feature
a soccer stadium that will be home to the Galaxy. It is scheduled to
open June 1.</TE>
<TE>   The tennis stadium can seat up to 13,000 and is expected to be
ready by July. Capacity will be 8,000 for the women's event.</TE>
<TE>   Though IMG said about three months ago it was close to a deal with
the Manhattan Country Club to stay for four more years, one never was
agreed upon.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Leiweke continues to work on a combined summer series,
bringing over the men's tournament at UCLA, which is a considerably
tougher assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just the start. There are great things coming," Leiweke
said. "This announcement will be the catalyst for a lot of other
events and a lot of other activity.</TE>
<TE>   "We're extremely pleased. In particular, I know many people
believed we would never get it done. I believe it bodes very well for
the future of that tennis facility and the facility as a whole."</TE>

<HD>Views on Title IX Contrast Sharply</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A blue-ribbon commission Wednesday heard five hours of passionate and
contradictory testimony on the volatile issue of whether Title IX,
federal legislation designed to boost sports opportunities for women,
has led to discrimination against men.</LD>
<LD>   A parade of witnesses told the commission that numerous men's
college sports teams have been dropped or trimmed back to comply with
the "proportionality" rule that requires a kind of athletic parity
between men and women. Because colleges have trouble filling the
rosters of women's teams, they are forced to cut men's teams,
witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   "If my daughter decides not to play volleyball, it should not
prohibit my son from trying out for football," said Chuck Neinas,
president of Neinas Sports Services.</LD>
<TE>   But other witnesses -- including actress Geena Davis, an
accomplished archer -- argued that without the numerical approach,
there would not have been the fivefold increase in women playing
sports in colleges since Title IX was adopted in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives us the hammer that we unfortunately have to yield to get
the changes we want," said Rosa Perez, president of Canada
(Community) College in Northern California and a former Stanford
softball player.</TE>
<TE>   Formed by U.S. Education Secretary Rod Paige, the Commission on
Opportunity in Athletics is holding hearings and workshops across the
country to determine whether changes should be made in Title IX.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proportionality standard, if women make up, for example,
55% of the student body, they should have 55% of the athletic spots.</TE>
<TE>   John Welty, president of Fresno State, said the California State
University campuses have trouble filling the rosters of women's teams
and have begun recruiting women from other states to play sports,
while simultaneously trimming the number of spots for men to remain
in compliance with the proportionality rule.</TE>
<TE>   "As a member of the male species, I'm embarrassed to admit that
without Title IX, women in America would not enjoy nearly the
athletic opportunities they have now," said Rick Bay, athletic
director at San Diego State. "That said, Title IX is not perfect and
it needs a pinch of common sense."</TE>
<TE>   But Andrew Zimbalist, economics professor at Smith College, said
that the problem facing sports such as wrestling and tennis is not
Title IX but the refusal of colleges to trim back their football
programs or the $1 million-plus salaries of many football and
basketball coaches.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing continues today with discussion by commissioners.
Chaired by Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland and former Phoenix
Mercury coach Cynthia Cooper, the commission is scheduled to provide
recommendations to Paige by Jan. 31.</TE>

<HD>Smith Set for Ankle Surgery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Receiver Ryan Smith will have surgery on his right ankle, provided
team physician Gerald Finerman gives him permission.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Richard Ferkel, a Van Nuys foot and ankle specialist,
recommended Tuesday that Smith have arthroscopic surgery through the
front and back of the ankle.</LD>
<LD>   "He said he can get to the fluid and scar tissue by going through
the back," Smith said. "I want to have the surgery as soon as
possible so I can be healthy by spring practice."</LD>
<TE>   Smith, a junior, injured the ankle midway through last season and
took injections of painkillers to continue playing. Finerman
performed surgery in February, but the injury never completely
healed.</TE>
<TE>   This season, Smith played in the first eight games for UCLA but
was never 100%. He sat out the last two games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It does not appear that defensive tackle Rodney Leisle will play
Saturday against USC. The junior preseason All-American has missed
five games because of a foot injury that is still giving him pain.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't look good," he said. "It hurts."</TE>
<TE>   Jon Dubravac has a concussion and is questionable. The senior
reserve receiver is the only Bruin who played the last time UCLA
defeated USC, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo often laments his poor memory, but he has a clear
image of his favorite moment against USC. It came in 1996, his first
year as head coach.</TE>
<TE>   "We were down by 17 at halftime and down by 17 with six minutes to
go," he said. "I saw a lot of people leaving. Then we tied it up and
beat them in double overtime. That was a game I'll never forget."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC expects the unexpected from UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   Trojan coaches and players are certain that Bruin Coach Bob Toledo
will add a trick play or two for Saturday's game at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said Wednesday that a bye last week
provided the No. 25 Bruins with a perfect opportunity to prepare a
surprise for the No. 7 Trojans.</LD>
<TE>   "They have a trick play list that's long," Carroll said. "Anybody
can lay back and wait for stuff to happen, but [we] have to go real
hard and get after it and be disciplined at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said the Trojans would rely on the experience of such
players as senior safeties Troy Polamalu and DeShaun Hill and
sophomore linebacker Matt Grootegoed to thwart any trickery.</TE>
<TE>   Freshmen Drew Olson and Matt Moore are playing quarterback for
UCLA, a situation that Carroll expects will inspire even more
creativity by the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Daryl Gross and Steve Lopes, senior associate athletic directors
at USC, returned to Los Angeles after meeting with Sugar Bowl
officials in New Orleans and Orange Bowl officials in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   If the Trojans defeat UCLA and Notre Dame, they would receive
consideration for an at-large berth in a bowl championship series
game.</TE>
<TE>   "We just wanted to get out in front of it and let them know we're
here," Gross said. "I think that was accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Mike Williams, who is nursing a thigh bruise,
participated in the entire practice.... Freshman cornerback Justin
Wyatt hurt his left knee during a competitive drill but said he would
practice today.... Freshman running back Hershel Dennis worked with
the scout team and Carroll said he provided the Trojan defense with a
good approximation of UCLA running back Tyler Ebell's speed.</TE>

<HD>USC Not Tailback U., but Trojans Can Run</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC quarterback Carson Palmer has thrown 380 passes, a number that no
doubt will have UCLA defenders peering skyward Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   But like bumpkin tourists in New York gazing at skyscrapers, their
pockets will be picked unless they are aware of street traffic.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans have run the ball 387 times, making their offense a
study in balance.</LD>
<TE>   Palmer's arm is the most dangerous weapon, to be sure. But the
legs of Justin Fargas and Sultan McCullough cause damage as well.</TE>
<TE>   Often, USC runs when the formation indicates a pass is coming.</TE>
<TE>   "Their offense is unorthodox," UCLA defensive coordinator Phil
Snow said. "They run a lot of formations and do unusual things out of
them. They bunch their wide receivers to one side in a passing
formation, then they run out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Containing the USC running game, in fact, is considered by Bruin
Coach Bob Toledo to be a key to the game. "We've got to get them out
of the rhythm of their offense," he said. "And a big part of that is
stopping the run. Fargas is an excellent back, he's really running
well. And McCullough is a home run threat."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojan senior tailbacks possess markedly different styles.
Fargas is a rugged runner with great leg strength. McCullough is one
of the fastest players in the Pacific 10 Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "When McCullough is in the game, we have to be more conscious of
contain, of not letting him get outside," UCLA linebacker Brandon
Chillar said. "Fargas is a hard runner. He goes north and south, and
gets up the field."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas has never run better in his injury-plagued career. He
rushed for 125 yards against Arizona State last Saturday, 139 yards
against Oregon on Oct. 26 and has scored a touchdown in four
consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   And he might never be more motivated than against UCLA, a school
he wanted to attend coming out of Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High.
Toledo indicated at the time that he was best suited as a defensive
back, so Fargas went to Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   After three seasons, three leg operations and one loss to UCLA, he
came to USC and sat out last season under transfer rules. Toledo's
five-year-old comments won't serve to motivate him.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not in my mind," Fargas said. "I don't need anybody
else's words to motivate me. I'm just going to play my game."</TE>
<TE>   So will McCullough, and his game is speed. He is the leading
Trojan rusher with 665 yards, six touchdowns and a 4.4 average. He
best season was 2000, when he had seven 100-yard games and rushed for
1,163 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Fullback Malaefou MacKenzie is another player the Bruins can't
ignore. "McKenzie runs, blocks and catches the ball," Snow said.
"Because he can do so many things, he gives them flexibility to run a
lot of formations with him as fullback.</TE>
<TE>   "USC can run the ball. They are physical and have a great scheme
that has proven to be successful. Their balance is our biggest
challenge."</TE>

<HD>Vargas Suspended 9 Months</HD>
<DH>In a 4-1 vote, a Nevada panel bars the Oxnard fighter over
steroid use before De La Hoya bout. Fine is $100,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS -- Members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission listened
to a contrite Fernando Vargas, listened to pleas for leniency from
his attorney, Pat English, and then voted, 4-1, Wednesday to suspend
the Oxnard fighter for nine months, retroactive to Sept. 14, and fine
him $100,000 for testing positive for steroids.</LD>
<LD>   It was on Sept. 14, after his TKO loss to Oscar De La Hoya, that
Vargas took a urine test that revealed the presence of the androgenic
anabolic steroid stanozolol in his bloodstream, illegal for fighters
under Nevada law.</LD>
<LD>   Although he continues to maintain that others in his camp gave him
the steroid without his knowledge, that they were slipped in with the
vitamins and supplements he was taking, Vargas told the
commissioners, "I hired individuals I felt were competent, but I
don't place the blame on anybody but myself. At the end of the day, I
am the captain of my ship."</LD>
<TE>   The individuals Vargas was referring to are strength and
conditioning coach John Philbin, who resigned after the fight, and
nutritionist Mazzan Ali, who has since been fired. Philbin wrote a
letter to the commission this month declaring his innocence and his
disapproval of Ali's methods. The commission tried unsuccessfully to
get a response from Ali. English told the commissioners he
appreciated Philbin's letter and was not pointing a finger at him.</TE>
<TE>   Rolando Arellano, Vargas' co-manager, told the commission, "There
is no dispute our hiring process was flawed." He promised to remedy
that by setting up criteria for future hires and demanding proof of
credentials.</TE>
<TE>   Luther Mack, chairman of the commission, and fellow commissioners
Tony Alamo, John Bailey and Raymond "Skip" Avansino Jr. voted for the
suspension and fine. The lone holdout was Edwin "Flip" Homansky.</TE>
<TE>   "We like Mr. Vargas," Mack said, "but we want to tell the rest of
the world that Nevada will do the right thing. We will protect the
fighter."</TE>
<TE>   Mack, who Tuesday had labeled Vargas' claim that he didn't know he
was being given steroids "a lame excuse," Wednesday told the fighter,
"Be careful who you hire."</TE>
<TE>   In voting against the motion, Homansky pointed out that a letter
sent out by the commission on July 1, reiterating a ban on steroids,
specified that, until Jan. 1, "There will be a period of leniency."
He also expressed concern that Vargas was being singled out.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas said he was "astonished" when he learned his blood test was
positive, because he thought steroids could be administered only
through a needle.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think of steroids," he said, "I think of the guy in 'Rocky
IV' pumping needles into his arm. I would give my life before I would
go out there and inject, before I would cheat. That's what I feel it
is, cheating. I figured I had no injections, no problems."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas said the weight he was losing and the muscle he was adding
lured him into continuing to take whatever pills he was offered. "All
my fellow Mexican friends," he said, "they don't look like this. I
figured I would keep these guys [his strength coach and nutritionist]
around.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I want to serve as an example to all fighters and athletes.
At the end of the day, you have to be responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas later joked that he might use the time off "to take a
chemistry class."</TE>
<TE>   To bolster his claim that he was unaware an illegal substance was
in his system, Vargas reminded the commissioners that he had ample
opportunity to avoid giving a urine sample that night.</TE>
<TE>   Taken to a hospital for examination after the fight, Vargas said
he subsequently drove to three labs before finding one that could
administer the test.</TE>
<TE>   "If he did it intentionally," Arellano later told reporters, "he
sure as hell went out of his way to be caught."</TE>
<TE>   English appealed to the commissioners to cut the suspension to six
months retroactive to September.</TE>
<TE>   Seated beside Vargas for the hearing was two-time heavyweight
champion Mike Tyson, who will return to the ring Feb. 22 against
Clifford Etienne in Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the decision was too harsh," said Tyson, a friend and
supporter of Vargas who has had his share of hearings before the
commission. "He didn't understand what went down with the steroids.
We are so naive. People take advantage of us to make a buck."</TE>

<HD>Audience Watches an Autopsy</HD>
<DH>German doctor defies British authorities, cuts into body in
front of 350 people and TV cameras.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>A maverick German doctor defied British authorities Wednesday by
slicing open a human body before a packed audience and television
cameras in the country's first public autopsy since 1830.</LD>
<LD>   Police weighing up a possible prosecution were among at least 350
fascinated spectators who attended the event led by Gunther von
Hagens in London's East End.</LD>
<LD>   Von Hagens could face three months in prison if authorities decide
he violated the Anatomy Act by returning to the days when autopsies
were a popular public spectacle in Britain.</LD>
<TE>   The professor, who has stirred controversy with his "Body Worlds"
exhibition of preserved human corpses, some dismembered, insisted
that he had the permission of the deceased's family and a sound legal
basis for performing the autopsy before the sellout crowd, whose
members paid about $19 to attend.</TE>
<TE>   One of his assistants identified the hairy, potbellied body as
that of a 72-year-old German man. "There was nothing exceptional in
his life. He was a businessman, an employee, who lost his job at the
age of 50. At that time he started drinking," the assistant said.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Von Hagens took his scalpel to the corpse.</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, some people in the crowd said they liked what
they saw.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's absolutely fascinating. I've never seen anything
like it before," said accountant Louise Cotton, 40.</TE>
<TE>   Von Hagens said he wanted to bring medical knowledge to a wider
audience. "There is huge demand among the public to see what an
autopsy entails, especially in light of the fact that this procedure
can be ordered on them ... without their consent according to British
law."</TE>

<HD>Suicide Bomber Kills at Least 10 on Jerusalem Bus</HD>
<DH>The attack on commuter vehicle carrying many schoolchildren
at rush hour comes during political uncertainty in Israel. Dozens are
hurt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King and Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian suicide bomber blew apart a commuter bus carrying
children to school at the height of rush hour this morning, killing
at least 10 people and wounding dozens more, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Ambulances careened to the working-class Kiryat Menahem
neighborhood in southern Jerusalem where the crowded bus exploded. At
least 40 wounded people were taken to three hospitals. Seven of those
were in serious to critical condition, Dr. Shmuel Shapira of Hadassah
Hospital in suburban Ein Kerem told Israeli radio.</LD>
<LD>   "I just saw burnt flesh, blackened people, everyone screaming and
moaning," said Janet Gino, a teacher from the coastal city of Haifa.
She was walking near the site when she heard the explosion and ran
toward the bus.</LD>
<TE>   Children's notebooks and backpacks were scattered inside the
shattered bus. Hysterical parents rushed to the scene to look for
their children but were being kept back by police.</TE>
<TE>   "It's rush hour before school, so kids were on their way to
classes," officer Ofer Sivan said.</TE>
<TE>   Bus No. 20 was en route downtown and blew up on Mexico Street.
Jerusalem Police Chief Mickey Levy said a Palestinian suicide bomber
boarded the bus a short time before detonating the bomb, blowing out
windows, buckling the roof and hurling people and body parts for
yards.</TE>
<TE>   "The bus was full," Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said 10 people were killed, in addition to the bomber.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the damage was at the front of the bus, which was badly
charred. Bloodied passengers staggered in the streets, which were
littered with shards of glass, before being whisked away by dozens of
emergency crews that sprang into well-practiced action.</TE>
<TE>   Other rescue workers and forensic specialists combed through the
remains of the green-and-white bus, placing black plastic bags along
the window frames to shield the carnage from public view.</TE>
<TE>   Cars parked nearby were also damaged by the powerful blast.</TE>
<TE>   Police Supt. Gil Kleiman, briefing reporters at the scene, said
the bomber had made his way to the middle of the bus.</TE>
<TE>   "It was 7:15 in the morning. Israel's workday starts early, so
everyone is traveling to work and school," he said as a small crowd
of protesters chanted, "Death to Arabs!"</TE>
<TE>   Uzi Landau, Israel's hawkish minister for public security, also
arrived at the scene. "We are too lenient with the Palestinians,"
Landau said. "It's a war. We have to do much more than what we are
doing to stop this."</TE>
<TE>   The attack was the first suicide bombing since Nov. 4, when two
immigrants from Argentina -- a security guard and a 15-year-old boy
-- were killed at a shopping mall in the town of Kfar Saba in central
Israel. The last bus bombing was Oct. 21, when the bomber rammed a
car full of explosives into a bus in northern Israel, killing 14.</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem, however, there had not been a suicide bombing in
nearly four months.</TE>
<TE>   The last killed nine people, including five Americans, in a
cafeteria at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. Security has been
extremely tight in the city ever since, and some residents had dared
to hope that phase of the war was over.</TE>
<TE>   Today's bombing comes as Israelis focus on a national election
campaign to choose a prime minister and legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon faces a formidable challenge from
within his Likud Party from hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu, who
advocates tougher action against the Palestinians to fight terrorism.
This latest attack will certainly inflame campaign rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army has reoccupied most Palestinian towns and cities
in the West Bank to try to halt the bombings that have been the
Palestinians' weapon of choice in 26 months of fighting. Netanyahu
and others on the right are demanding that the government expel
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   The government immediately blamed Arafat for the attack, although
no specific group initially claimed responsibility. Jerusalem Mayor
Ehud Olmert, at the scene, branded the attack a "savage act."</TE>
<TE>   Egged, the national bus company, had just announced that it was
suing the Palestinian Authority for damages to its buses, which are
frequent targets of bombers and gunmen. Egged is demanding about $1.2
million for damage in the year 2001 alone.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier today, dozens of Israeli tanks entered three villages in
the southern Gaza Strip, residents said, and destroyed the house of a
suspected militant. Doctors at a clinic said four people were
moderately wounded.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, a Palestinian teenager was killed and at least four
others were wounded in Tulkarm as the Israeli military continued
operations in the West Bank.</TE>

<CX>   Israeli lawsuit -- A story in Section A on Thursday misstated the
amount of damages sought in a lawsuit filed by the Israeli national
bus company Egged, whose vehicles are frequent targets of attack. The
company is suing the Palestinian Authority for $12 million, not $1.2
million, for damages in 2001.</CX>

<LD>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met in Belgrade with the chief U.N.
war crimes prosecutor, a gesture apparently aimed at stepping up
pressure on Yugoslav officials to arrest suspects wanted by The Hague
tribunal.</LD>
<LD>   Carla Del Ponte has complained repeatedly that Yugoslavia has
failed to apprehend key suspects, including the Bosnian Serb wartime
army commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no political will to arrest him," Del Ponte said after
meeting Annan. She said that she had also met with the Yugoslav army
leader Gen. Branko Krga, but won no pledge that Mladic will be
arrested.</LD>

<LD>President Robert Mugabe has tightened control over Zimbabwe's food
supplies, starving opponents and manipulating aid to enforce his hold
on power, a Danish human rights group said.</LD>
<LD>   "If it is not possible to increase nonpartisan food supplies into
the country ... starvation and eventually death will occur along
party political lines," Christian Tramsen of Physicians for Human
Rights-Denmark told a news conference in South Africa.</LD>
<LD>   Mugabe's party rejects the allegation. Half of Zimbabwe's 11
million people are at risk of starvation, the U.N. says.</LD>

<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>Blanking on an acquaintance's name can happen at the most inopportune
moments, as President Bush discovered Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Bush was introducing a four-member U.S. congressional delegation
before giving his speech on the future of NATO when he just could not
remember the name of a California congressman -- and a fellow
Republican, no less.</LD>
<LD>   The lawmaker in question was Rep. Elton Gallegly of Simi Valley,
who plays a prominent role in U.S.-European affairs as chairman of
the House International Relations subcommittee on Europe. In fact, a
news release from Gallegly's office said he was attending the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Prague "at the invitation" of
the president.</LD>
<TE>   Gallegly and the other members of the delegation had flown all
night to arrive in time for Bush's speech. In his introductory
remarks, Bush singled out by name Sens. George Voinovich (R-Ohio) and
Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo). He then
pointed toward Gallegly but said nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly broke the fleeting but awkward silence by shouting out
his name, which Bush repeated.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, White House Communications Director Dan Bartlett cited
the bright lights in the president's eyes as the reason for the
lapse.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly had his own explanation. "He thinks of me as Elton, and I
don't think he wanted to call me by my first name."</TE>
<TE>   After the speech, the president quickly apologized to Gallegly.
"God, I'm sorry, Elton," Gallegly quoted Bush as saying.</TE>

<LD>Excerpts from President Bush's remarks in Prague:</LD>
<LD>   Tomorrow in Prague we will have reached a decisive moment, a
historic moment, for tomorrow we will invite new members into our
alliance. It's a bold decision -- to guarantee the freedom of
millions of people.</LD>
<LD>   At the summit, we'll make the most significant reforms in NATO
since 1949, reforms which will allow our alliance to effectively
confront new dangers.</LD>
<TE>   And in the years to come, all of the nations of Europe will
determine their place in world events.</TE>
<TE>   They will take up global responsibilities or choose to live in
isolation from the challenges of our time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Because America supports a more united Europe, we strongly support
the enlargement of NATO, now and in the future....</TE>
<TE>   A larger NATO is good for Russia as well. Later this week I will
visit St. Petersburg. I will tell my friend, [President] Vladimir
Putin, and the Russian people that they too will gain from the
security and stability of nations to Russia's west.</TE>
<TE>   Russia does not require a buffer zone of protection.</TE>
<TE>   It needs peaceful and prosperous neighbors who are also friends.</TE>
<TE>   And we need a strong and democratic Russia as our friend and
partner to face the century's new challenges.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Members recently added to NATO, and those invited to join, bring
greater clarity to purposes of our alliance, because they understand
the lessons of the last century.</TE>
<TE>   Those with fresh memories of tyranny know the value of freedom.
Those who have lived through a struggle of good against evil are
never neutral between them.</TE>
<TE>   Czechs and Slovaks learned through the harsh experience of 1938
that when great democracies fail to confront danger, greater dangers
follow.</TE>
<TE>   And the people of the Baltics learned that aggression left
unchecked by the great democracies can rob millions of their liberty
and their lives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Our NATO alliance faces dangers very different from those it was
formed to confront. Yet never has our need for collective defense
been more urgent. The Soviet Union is gone, but freedom still has
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   We're threatened by terrorism, bred within failed states. It's
present within our own cities.</TE>
<TE>   We're threatened by the spread of chemical and biological and
nuclear weapons, which are produced by outlaw regimes and could be
delivered either by missile or terrorist cell.</TE>
<TE>   For terrorists and terror states, every free nation -- every free
nation -- is a potential target.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Today the world is also uniting to answer the unique and urgent
threat posed by Iraq. A dictator who has used weapons of mass
destruction on his own people must not be allowed to produce or
possess those weapons....</TE>
<TE>   Saddam Hussein has been given a very short time to declare
completely and truthfully his arsenal of terror. Should he again deny
that this arsenal exists, he will have entered his final stage with a
lie.</TE>
<TE>   And deception this time will not be tolerated....</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Great evil is stirring in the world. The young here are coming up
in a different world, different era, a different time, a different
series of threats.</TE>
<TE>   We face perils we've never thought about, perils we've never seen
before. But they're dangerous. They're just as dangerous as those
perils that your fathers and mothers and grandfathers and
grandmothers faced.</TE>
<TE>   The hopes of all mankind depend on the courage and the unity of
great democracies.</TE>
<TE>   In this hour of challenge, NATO will do what it has done before:
We will stand firm against the enemies of freedom and we'll prevail.</TE>

<HD>Bush Invokes History of Europe</HD>
<DH>President raises specter of Nazism and Cold War to frame
his campaign against Iraq's Hussein.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As presented by President Bush in Prague on Wednesday, a war against
Iraq would take its place alongside the great struggles that defined
civilization through much of the 20th century.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech to students in the Czech capital, Bush used the fight
against the Nazis and the Cold War division of Europe to frame his
campaign to disarm Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The perils facing
the world are "just as dangerous as those perils that your fathers
and mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers faced," he said.</LD>
<LD>   But the analogy, in which Bush seeks the highest moral ground,
drew some questions from historians -- as well as some recognition
that it may be apt.</LD>
<TE>   Militarily, Iraq is in a different league from Nazi Germany and
the Soviet Union. It is not threatening to dominate the world, as
those regimes did. And Hussein, unlike Adolf Hitler and the Axis
powers, has not drawn the allegiance of millions of followers
clamoring for a new world order, historians say.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion that he represents on a geopolitical scale a threat in
any way comparable to Germany or the Soviet Union is ridiculous on
the face of it," said Lloyd Gardner, a professor of diplomatic
history at Rutgers University.</TE>
<TE>   In World War II and during the Cold War, he said, "you could say
the majority of the world was on one side, intellectually and
morally. Now, there's a lot of doubt out there."</TE>
<TE>   But taken another way, Gardner said, the risks are every bit as
great as those faced by the United States in World War II or by NATO
during the Cold War. The danger Hussein could pose with nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons, he said, could cause death on a vast
scale.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's sweeping analogy between the current U.S.-declared war on
terror and the conflicts of the 20th century is of a piece with the
administration's broad view of the United States in the world,
military historian John Lewis Gaddis said.</TE>
<TE>   Writing in the current issue of Foreign Policy magazine, he
contrasted Bush's ambitious foreign policy goals with the limited
ones laid out by the Clinton administration in December 1999. Bush,
Gaddis wrote, has adopted the mission begun by President Woodrow
Wilson: "Spreading democracy everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Bush had previously sought to draw the analogy between Iraq and
Nazi Germany when speaking to Europeans, most notably last Memorial
Day. Amid the graves of a cemetery for U.S. troops in Normandy, he
sought to use the memory of the D-Day landings to stir the European
alliance.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush's call to arms Wednesday was made to Europeans deeply
skeptical of the war on terror, dismayed by the president's
insistence that they should push aside all other concerns, and
reluctant to join a military assault against Iraq that, to many,
feels more like a war of choice than one thrust upon the world by
empire-building tyrants.</TE>
<TE>   Polls conducted in June and July by the German Marshall Fund and
the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations found that six out of 10
Europeans favored a U.S.-led war with Iraq, provided that it has the
support of the U.N. and American allies.</TE>
<TE>   But such support appears to have tumbled. Massive demonstrations
have been mobilized in European cities to protest U.S. war threats
against Iraq. Recent polls in nations allied with Washington --
Germany, France and Italy, among them -- found strong opposition.
Even in neutral Switzerland, 87% of those surveyed for one poll
opposed U.S. military intervention in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Bush administration official, speaking with reporters in
Prague, expressed disbelief that European leaders, not to mention
their constituents, wouldn't regard the campaign against Iraq with
the same sense of moral purpose that Bush brings to his argument.</TE>
<TE>   But, said Michael J. Glennon, a professor at the Fletcher School
of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, the conflicts of the 20th
century also brought death on such a scale that, after World War II,
the global response was the creation of the United Nations and the
recognition that the world would resolve disputes by peaceful means.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Glennon said, the legal order that was established with the
founding of the U.N. in 1945 is threatened by repeated use of force
-- often unsanctioned by the United Nations -- to resolve conflict,
and "we are moving ... to an abyss."</TE>
<TE>   Glennon said, however, that if Iraq is found to possess chemical
and biological weapons, and develops a nuclear arsenal, "it can
dramatically alter the contours of everyday life in this country."</TE>
<TE>   The fight against terrorism, he said, could be expanded to such an
extent that machines to detect biohazards could be erected in the
doorways of U.S. workplaces and vaster collections of personal data
could be collected by the government, with a "consequent loss of
privacy."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has framed the central question as this:
Does the risk of inaction outweigh the risk of acting?</TE>
<TE>   When the fight was against Nazi Germany, and against Japan after
Pearl Harbor was attacked, Glennon said, "few people were willing to
conclude not acting was a viable option."</TE>
<TE>   In his speech Wednesday, Bush argued that the U.S. and its allies
are once again facing only one viable option.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. planes bombed three air-defense communications facilities in
southern Iraq on Wednesday after Iraqi gunners fired missiles and
artillery at the aircraft, U.S. officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The strikes hit facilities between Al Kut, about 100 miles
southeast of Baghdad, and Basra, 275 miles southeast of the capital.</LD>
<LD>   An Iraqi military spokesman said U.S. and British planes bombed
"civilian and service installations" in Basra province. No casualties
were reported.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. planes have attacked six air-defense facilities this week.
Pentagon officials say Iraq has stepped up efforts to shoot down U.S.
and British pilots patrolling the "no-fly" zone over southern Iraq as
U.N. weapons inspectors prepare to begin work.</TE>
<TE>   Chief inspector Hans Blix, making a stopover in Cyprus on
Wednesday after two days of talks in Baghdad, said that
"businesslike" talks with Iraqi officials had set the stage for a new
round of inspections starting next week, including possible
unannounced drop-ins on President Saddam Hussein's palaces.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile in the Iraqi capital, the Ministry of Information
suspended publication of Babel, a newspaper owned by Hussein's elder
son.</TE>
<TE>   "The paper was ordered shut down for 30 days for violating the
regulations," an Iraqi official said on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Media are tightly controlled in Iraq, but this ban was unusual
because the paper is owned by Uday Hussein.</TE>

<HD>Bush Rallies NATO Summit</HD>
<DH>As Atlantic alliance is about to expand by seven more
nations, Bush urges its 'great democracies' to join the effort to
disarm Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>Warning against inaction, President Bush urged all European allies
Wednesday to join the U.S.-led coalition to disarm Iraq, saying that
"when great democracies fail to confront danger, greater dangers
follow."</LD>
<LD>   In an address on the eve of NATO's expansion from 19 to 26
nations, Bush spoke of what he sees as the alliance's obligation to
confront the modern-day threats posed by terrorists and regimes such
as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's, as it moves away from its roots
as an anti-Soviet defense grouping.</LD>
<LD>   The president also pledged the alliance's unqualified military
protection to the seven incoming members, all part of the formerly
communist East.</LD>
<TE>   "Anyone who would choose you for an enemy also chooses us for an
enemy," Bush said to Slovenia, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania and Bulgaria.</TE>
<TE>   "Never again in the face of aggression will you stand alone," he
added, as he invoked the memory of totalitarianism that cast a huge
shadow over Europe in the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Bush's remarks, however, were pointed reminders of current
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "The world needs the nations of this continent to be active in the
defense of freedom -- not inward-looking or isolated by
indifference," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   NATO is facing its "hour of challenge," he warned, because "great
evil is stirring in the world."</TE>
<TE>   "Ignoring dangers or excusing aggression may temporarily avert
conflict, but they don't bring true peace," Bush said, while at the
same time insisting to a wary European audience that war with Iraq
isn't a foregone conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Bush administration officials here wouldn't elaborate on
the president's remarks -- for instance, declining to specify what
countries he had in mind when he said that the nations of Europe must
"take up global responsibilities or choose to live in isolation from
the challenges of our time."</TE>
<TE>   Bush and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder have had a very
public falling-out in recent weeks over the latter's refusal to
participate in military action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The officials also wouldn't explain Bush's meaning when he said of
Hussein: "Should he again deny that this arsenal exists, he will have
entered his final stage with a lie."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of scenarios that can be played out," White House
Communications Director Dan Bartlett said.</TE>
<TE>   Walking a Tightrope</TE>
<TE>   Both in his NATO address and his remarks during a brief news
conference earlier in the day with Czech President Vaclav Havel, Bush
seemed to be walking a rhetorical tightrope.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, he didn't want to ease the pressure on Baghdad to
disarm, having already taken steps to assemble an international
coalition committed to going to war, if necessary, to force Iraq to
get rid of its suspected weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, with considerable angst on the continent, Bush also must
guard against warmongering language that might hamper his ongoing
efforts to broaden the anti-Iraq coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, during his appearance with Havel at Prague Castle, Bush more
than once held out the possibility that a war could be avoided.</TE>
<TE>   "If the collective will of the world is strong, we can achieve
disarmament peacefully," Bush said. "However, should he choose not to
disarm, the United States will lead a coalition of the willing to
disarm him."</TE>
<TE>   Asked specifically about Schroeder's strong opposition to war in
Iraq, Bush replied: "If the decision is made to use military force,
we will consult with our friends, and we hope that our friends will
join us. And as to Germany's role, it's a decision Germany will
make."</TE>
<TE>   At a later point in the news conference, Bush again raised the
possibility of a peaceful resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "War is my last choice, my last option. I hope we can do this
peacefully. It is possible that Saddam Hussein gets the message that
we're serious about disarmament and he should fully disarm. That's
possible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The possibility becomes more real if he understands that there is
a true consequence for his failure to disarm."</TE>
<TE>   In his call to action, Bush hailed the triumph of the incoming
NATO members, saying that with their entry into the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, "the soul of Europe grows stronger." He said
they will "bring greater clarity" to NATO's mission "because they
understand the lessons of the last century."</TE>
<TE>   Bush added pointedly: "And this spirit is needed in the councils
of a new Europe."</TE>
<TE>   After the president's speech, a senior administration official
offered some context to those remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "The president has been struck, in his meetings with the Central
and East European leaders, by the perspective that they bring to all
of NATO's older members, including the United States," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "These are leaders for whom the totalitarian horrors of the 20th
century are not things they read about in books, and not things that
their parents or grandparents told them, but things they themselves
lived through in ways that were personal, up front and occasionally
very nasty.... And that's something the new allies will bring and
have brought to the alliance."</TE>
<TE>   Niche Roles in NATO</TE>
<TE>   As for NATO itself, Bush said its forces need upgrading to reflect
the challenges of a post-Sept. 11 world.</TE>
<TE>   "To meet all of this century's emerging threats, from terror camps
in remote regions to hidden laboratories of outlaw regimes, NATO must
develop new military capabilities," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "NATO forces must become better able to fight side by side. Those
forces must be more mobile and more swiftly deployed. The allies need
more special operations forces, better precision strike capabilities
and more modern command structures," Bush added.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, the president said that in a transformed and
more effective NATO, members need not achieve comparable military
capability. Rather, different nations can assume "niche" roles --
such as the Czech Republic's expertise in dealing with the aftermath
of a biological weapon attack, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In his formal , Bush strongly reaffirmed the United States'
commitment to Europe, saying that the Atlantic alliance remains
"America's most important global relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Once more, however, he reached back into history to drive home his
point.</TE>
<TE>   "The commitment of my nation to Europe is found in the carefully
tended graves of young Americans who died for this continent's
freedom," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And that ongoing commitment, he said, is epitomized by the
thousands of GIs still serving here -- "from the Balkans to Bavaria,
still willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for this continent's
future."</TE>

<HD>Tails Wag Over End of British Quarantine</HD>
<DH>Legislation expected to take effect Dec. 11 will mean U.S.
pets won't be held in kennels for six months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Wallace</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>When U.S. diplomat Michael Murphy looks at Fred, the 6-year-old
basset hound he brought to London from Washington more than a year
ago, he sees a member of the family, a "stubborn but friendly" dog he
likes to take to the pub.</LD>
<LD>   Yet to British eyes, Fred -- and pets like him -- was a waddling
Trojan horse of disease, threatening their island nation with rabies.
For the past century, U.S.-born dogs have had to endure six months in
quarantine before being admitted to Britain, a regulation that has
always put a mild strain on an otherwise brotherly transatlantic
relationship.</LD>
<LD>   Fred's second-class status is about to end. On Wednesday, the
British government introduced legislation to rescind the quarantine
requirement for U.S. and Canadian cats and dogs, a measure expected
to take effect Dec. 11.</LD>
<TE>   It was victory won on the back of an eight-year-long campaign by
London-based pet owners and North American diplomats, joined by some
of the Atlantic-hopping celebrity aristocracy -- from actress
Elizabeth Hurley to pop singer Elton John -- who complained that they
couldn't take their pets with them when they traveled between
continents.</TE>
<TE>   "We could not have done it without a bit of glitz from the Liz
Hurleys, but we also had improvements in medical science on our
side," said Mary Fretwell, the driving force behind the Passport for
Pets lobby group -- an unusual alliance of cat people and dog people.</TE>
<TE>   The wife of a former British ambassador to France, Fretwell set up
the organization after her own basset hound, Bertie, died in the
1980s after a spell in quarantine.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, she celebrated with champagne at the London
residence of U.S. Ambassador William Farish, where British Animal
Health Minister Elliot Morley announced the relaxation of the pet
import rules in a room filled with people telling their own sad
stories of pets left behind.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. business executives, government officials and academics have
long complained that the quarantine was a deterrent to taking a job
in Britain. Those pet owners who did accept postings often spent
traumatic weekends visiting their cats and dogs held in solitary
confinement at government-approved kennels.</TE>
<TE>   The quarantine will now be lifted, said Morley -- a cat owner
himself -- provided the pets have a microchip inserted under their
skin and are vaccinated for rabies at a recognized veterinary clinic
before entering Britain. This Pet Travel Scheme, or PETS, will
provide the animal with its own electronic and documented "passport."</TE>
<TE>   The pets would also have to travel in and out of Britain on an
approved air carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Dropping the restrictions required a huge psychological
readjustment for the British. Great pet lovers themselves, they have
used the strict quarantine to successfully shield themselves from
rabies, the potentially fatal viral infection that attacks the
central nervous system.</TE>
<TE>   Fretwell recalls her first meeting eight years ago with the senior
British civil servant in charge of the quarantine policy, who told
her: "I have seen ministers come and go over this, and I will see you
go too."</TE>
<TE>   The quarantine could not be bent or waived -- not for CEOs or
soldiers, ambassadors or even the blind.</TE>
<TE>   Many saw the policy as draconian: It affected an estimated quarter
of a million Americans living in Britain. Former U.S. Ambassador
Raymond Seitz, who put some of his own dogs through the process, said
separating people from their pets for six months was "ludicrous,
awful and dreadful."</TE>
<TE>   The policy also gave rise to an illegal underground of pet
smuggling. For a few thousand dollars, rogue boat owners would offer
to sneak pets into the country across the Channel from France.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it was the opening of the Channel Tunnel that helped change
British attitudes. While the "Chunnel" was being built in the 1980s
and '90s, there were loudly expressed fears that rabid animals would
use the new route to get into Britain.</TE>
<TE>   The threat never materialized. So restrictions on cats and dogs
started to come off, first in February 2000, when dogs and cats were
allowed in from Western Europe under the PETS program, and then 11
months later, when an additional 28 countries from Australia to Japan
were added to the list. This change allowed Americans to launder
their pets through friends or "foster" owners in Europe -- as the
Murphys did with Fred -- rather than go the quarantine route.</TE>
<TE>   Directly bringing pets from the United States and Canada still
required quarantine because of the presence of rabies in North
American wildlife. Only after two scientific studies described the
risk of North American pets bringing rabies to Britain as extremely
low did the government feel confident enough to drop the restriction.</TE>
<TE>   American pets will still need to spend their first two or three
nights in holding kennels while their paperwork is checked. Heathrow
Airport is already installing extra kennels in anticipation of the
added demand.</TE>

<HD>Alliance Leaders Attend a Love Fest</HD>
<DH>In an ornate castle, dignitaries at a banquet toast Vaclav
Havel and their military league. Outside, protesters call for end to
war, hunger.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>On the hilltop Prague Castle that he calls home, Czech President
Vaclav Havel has installed a giant pulsating neon heart, in what the
onetime anti-communist dissident calls a symbol of "love,
understanding and decency."</LD>
<LD>   On the eve of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit, he told
President Bush and other leaders Wednesday that it was also "a sign
of our hospitality."</LD>
<LD>   In return, the NATO leaders honored their host at a black-tie
banquet at the castle -- and reveled in the Western alliance's Cold
War success.</LD>
<TE>   French President Jacques Chirac, speaking on behalf of all the
leaders, praised "the friendly, humble, soft but vivid light of the
iron man who, in the dark depths of jail, in the abyss of
totalitarianism, never weakened."</TE>
<TE>   " 'Truth will prevail,' you used to say. Indeed, it did prevail,"
Chirac declared to the former playwright. "We bear witness to this
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   As the leaders of the world's dominant military alliance prepared
to invite in seven new members -- all formerly under communist rule
-- and shift NATO's focus to the U.S.-declared war on terrorism,
antiwar and anti-globalization activists staged protests in the
center of the Czech Republic's capital -- and saw in the neon heart
symbolism of another kind.</TE>
<TE>   One of the protesters, a university student from Germany who
declined to give her name, pointed to what she called hypocrisy in
the glowing red heart. "It's, 'Hey, we are the good boys, we need to
protect the world. Our big heart,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   There was indeed a self-congratulatory tone to the pre-dinner
speeches by Chirac and NATO Secretary-General George Robertson
honoring Havel. The Czech leader is nearing the end of his second and
final term as president, having also served as the former
Czechoslovakia's president, and the dinner was in part meant to
salute him and his role in the collapse of Soviet power.</TE>
<TE>   Chirac praised "the light of the writer and the dramatist who, by
the power of the pen, armed solely with courage and his faith in
mankind and truth, has nurtured the hopes of the oppressed who were
denied democracy."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a moment in history when Europe ... is at last gathering
as one, a moment when Europe and North America affirm their common
values and the indivisible nature of their security policy," Chirac
said.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson declared that "this will be NATO's transformation
summit," preparing it for threats and challenges in the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   "Tomorrow, in the NATO summit, we will make real history,"
Robertson said. "Tonight, we honor a man, Vaclav Havel, who made that
history possible.... You, Mr. President, kept the flame of freedom
burning here. It was a flame of bright hope amid dark oppression. You
were an inspiration, at home and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, scarcely more than a decade on from the recovery of Czech
democracy, you are president of your country and the host and dean of
the NATO summit in Prague. Who says dreams don't come true?"</TE>
<TE>   Protesters assembling in Prague had a very different take on
events, carrying banners and posters with messages such as "Stop War,
No Blood for Oil." One banner, sarcastically proclaiming "Thank You
NATO," showed a starving child holding out a bowl as a plane flew
over and dropped in bullets. Two main demonstrations Wednesday drew
only about 600 participants each, but larger protests are expected
today.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day, thousands of children have to die because they don't
have enough food to eat," said Ondrej Slacalek, a Czech university
student and organizer of a protest meant to mock the banquet
activities. "At the same time these children are dying, the people
responsible for these deaths are eating very good food."</TE>
<TE>   The scene at the castle was glittering. The dining room was a
stunning hall with parquet floors, white walls, large mirrors and
gilt molding. The leaders' table was circular, with glass bowls in
the center floating flowers of white, yellow and orange.</TE>
<TE>   Havel's wife, Dagmar, wore a simple but elegant evening dress.
First Lady Laura Bush wore a plum-colored gown with matching shawl
and a large gold necklace with prominent green and red jewels.
Waiters in black tie and white gloves served wild mushroom terrine on
silver trays; followed by fish consomme with saffron, crayfish and
fresh vegetables; guinea fowl with old Bohemian mustard sauce, snow
peas and potato pancakes; and raspberries.</TE>
<TE>   Considerable interest has focused on whether Bush and German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will use the summit to patch up frosty
personal relations caused by the German leader's tactics in his
recent reelection campaign, which were based in part on opposition to
Bush's policies on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush and Schroeder didn't engage each other during the toasts,
when the two were seated at opposite ends of the table. Most of the
dinner was closed to the press, and there were no immediate accounts
of whether Bush and Schroeder spoke to each other at all.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Bush appeared in high spirits at a brief news
conference after meeting with Havel. A Czech reporter began a
question saying: "President Bush, you have said some lofty words
here. The Czech Republic ... " Bush interjected: "I said some what?"</TE>
<TE>   "Lofty words," came the reply, to general laughter.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has ever accused me of being a poet before, but thank
you," Bush said, to more laughter.</TE>

<HD>Oil Spill Creeps Up the Spanish Coast</HD>
<DH>Crews work to limit the damage caused by the tanker leak.
But officials predict the latest slick will sully more beaches and
inlets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey Fleishman and Cristina Mateo Yanguas Special to The
Times</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>Strong North Atlantic winds are pushing another huge oil slick from a
tanker that ruptured off the Spanish coast as environmentalists and
emergency crews frantically attempted to corral the spill Wednesday
and prevent further catastrophe to a multimillion-dollar fishing
industry and one of Europe's most delicate ecosystems.</LD>
<LD>   Oozing through the ocean and gooey as tar, the 6,000-ton oil spill
was creeping up the coast as a fleet of boats strung out floating
barriers. Officials predicted that at least some of the slick from
the sunken Prestige oil tanker, which was carrying 77,000 tons of
fuel, would pollute more beaches and inlets in Spain and Portugal by
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   It is possible that changing ocean currents and shifting 60-mph
gusts could sweep the oil farther out to sea. Winds and 25-foot waves
weakened the 22-mile black sheen by splitting it into several parts.
But emergency crews were bracing for the worst. If the latest slick
reaches land, it will foul a longer stretch of craggy coves and
damage a wider swath of the fishing industry than the previous
slicks.</LD>
<TE>   More than 1,000 fishermen have been forced off the seas, and
untold numbers of birds and other wildlife are believed to have
perished. Spanish authorities announced a 30% decline in seafood
sales in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists are hoping that most of the Prestige cargo --
about 65,000 tons of oil -- will solidify in the frigid water and
remain entombed in the vessel, which snapped in two Tuesday and sank
about 133 miles off the northwestern Spanish coast. So far, officials
said, no sign of a massive leak has bubbled up from the depths.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that the sunken part does not spill its fuel. But it's
still a time bomb at the bottom of the sea," said Maria Jose
Caballero, head of Greenpeace's coastal project. "There's nothing
that makes us believe it won't finally burst and leak all its oil."</TE>
<TE>   Spanish Environment Minister Jaume Matas said: "We still don't
know whether we have passed the threshold of this crisis."</TE>
<TE>   As volunteers and Spanish soldiers scraped gobs of oil from rocks
and boats and birds along nearly 200 miles of the Galician coast, the
game of second-guessing and blame reverberated across Europe. French
President Jacques Chirac called the Prestige a "garbage ship" and
said that too many poorly regulated tankers are plying the seas and
skirting European environmental codes.</TE>
<TE>   Government Criticized</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists criticized the Spanish government for not towing
the Prestige to a port and off-loading the oil shortly after it began
listing and leaking in stormy seas a week ago. The government instead
attempted to limit damage by towing the vessel farther out to sea,
where it cracked and sank in water nearly 12,000 feet, or about two
miles, deep. The Spanish media reported that the government
considered bombing the Prestige with F-18 fighter jets in hopes the
explosions would burn off the fuel. The wayward vessel was also
barred from entering ports in France, Britain and Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   The Prestige -- a 26-year-old Japanese-built tanker -- passed its
annual inspection last year in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Three
years earlier, the ship was cited for safety violations in at least
two ports. In May 1999, U.S. authorities in New York cited the ship
for "a deficiency in safety equipment." Four months later in
Rotterdam, the Netherlands, the vessel was given a similar citation
and also written up for problems with life-saving equipment. Neither
was considered serious enough to keep the tanker off the seas.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Mench, a spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard, could not confirm
Wednesday whether his agency had ever cited the Prestige for any
serious violations. Mench said that after receiving numerous media
requests, the Coast Guard performed a cursory search of its records
and found nothing serious pertaining to the Prestige.</TE>
<TE>   "The ship was probably not fit to travel," said Emilio Martin,
secretary general of the independent Spanish Federation of Shipping
Pilots, which oversees traffic safety in Spanish ports.</TE>
<TE>   The Prestige is registered in Liberia and managed by Universe
Maritime Ltd., a Greek company. Chartered by a Swiss-based Russian
oil trader, the Prestige left the Baltic Sea and was bound for
Singapore when its single hull cracked last week in rough seas. The
Spanish government has begun legal proceedings against the ship's
backers and has jailed its captain, Apostolus Maguras. He is charged
with harming the environment and disobeying authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish government, frustrated by the layers of different
companies connected to the Prestige, has demanded that one of the
ship's insurers, London Steamship, deposit $60 million as a guarantee
against possible fines and compensation claims. Preliminary cleanup
costs and lost business due to closed fishing waters is estimated at
$42 million, Matas said.</TE>
<TE>   "We need more transparency" for who's to blame for this disaster,
said Simon Cripps, director of the World Wildlife Federation marine
program.</TE>
<TE>   The European Commission is contemplating banning single-hull
tankers, which compose half of the world's 10,000-strong oil shipping
fleet, from Europe's ports. A United Nations worldwide ban on
single-hull vessels -- often considered disasters waiting to happen
-- will be phased in by 2015.</TE>
<TE>   The Prestige's saga has unfolded like a slow-motion environmental
nightmare as the Spanish shoreline watched for days while the ship
rolled in high seas and finally split apart, releasing black tides
too big to stop. Emergency crews have laid almost 20 miles of
floating barriers, but rough seas are lessening their effectiveness.
Fishermen in towns such as La Coruna and El Ferrol are contemplating
stringing their trawlers across inlets to block more oil damage.</TE>
<TE>   The Galicia region boasts some of Europe's finest fishing waters
and a range of birds, including puffins, razorbills and the
endangered guillemot. The spill has nearly destroyed the coming
holiday fishing season, when Spaniards increase their shopping for
clams, mussels and shellfish. The rocky coast has 11 species of
sharks and produces percebes, a thumb-sized barnacle served as a
delicacy in restaurants. In recent days, the cost of percebes has
jumped from 54 euros per kilogram, or about 2.2 pounds, to 72 euros.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal Threatened</TE>
<TE>   Scientists from the World Wildlife Federation estimated that parts
of the newest oil slick will reach shore by Friday south of Cape
Finisterre, where fishermen spotted small "stains" on the waves
Tuesday. If winds and currents change, the damage could also spread
to Portugal, which was racing to protect its beaches Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be worse than the damage we already have," said Luis
Suarez, a World Wildlife Federation researcher.</TE>
<TE>   The Prestige's cargo of intermediate-grade fuel oil is less toxic
than crude oil, but it is extremely thick and difficult to clean.</TE>
<TE>   If the 65,000 tons of oil that sank with the ship surfaces, it
would create a spill twice as large as the Exxon Valdez disaster in
Alaska in 1989, which caused more than $2 billion in damage.</TE>

<HD>Testimony Offers Intimate Look at a Sept. 11 Hijacker's
Life</HD>
<DH>The girlfriend of one of the pilots describes a lengthy,
tumultuous relationship. Her account comes at trial of alleged 9/11
accomplice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dirk Laabs</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>HAMBURG, Germany</DL>
<LD>The trial of Mounir Motassadeq, a Moroccan man accused of assisting
the Sept. 11 hijackers, has produced occasional glimpses into the
inner workings of the terrorist plot -- when the hijackers trained,
where they met and how -- but the mechanical details have been few.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the testimony of a 28-year-old newly certified
physician named Aysel Senguen brought the sharpest reminder yet that
the men, who have often been portrayed as steely eyed assassins, were
in many respects quite normal.</LD>
<LD>   Senguen was the longtime girlfriend of alleged suicide-pilot Ziad
Jarrah. Jarrah is thought to have piloted United Airlines Flight 93,
which crashed near Shanksville, Pa.</LD>
<TE>   On the stand, Senguen told the story of two young students in the
eastern German town of Greifswald, meeting, and falling in and out of
love so many times she couldn't count them.</TE>
<TE>   "We had problems since the beginning," she said.</TE>
<TE>   They hid the relationship from her strict Turkish parents. They
had to live apart when they chose fields of study that Greifswald
couldn't accommodate. And Jarrah, whom friends and relatives have
often described as the most free-spirited and secular of the
hijackers, grew increasingly religious, even demanding at one point
that Senguen begin covering herself as traditional Muslim women do.
She refused, and the problems always dimmed, replaced by talk of
careers and children and a life together.</TE>
<TE>   In total, Senguen and Jarrah were a couple for five years. They
met in Greifswald in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrah started to change after he moved to Hamburg to continue his
studies in 1997, Senguen said. That's when he urged her to veil
herself in public. "But he was never pushing me. He was patient," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   She said his radicalization peaked in the summer of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "He was not feeling well -- emotionally. He thought his studies
were too dry, he had no orientation in life, and we had broken up
again," Senguen said. Their different opinions about religion were
often a reason for their arguments, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1999, Jarrah disappeared. Senguen suspected he had gone to
Chechnya to fight alongside the Islamic separatists. He had mentioned
that he thought the war in Chechnya was unfair, and he sometimes
talked about the jihad, or holy war, saying that it was a struggle
for freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "He had changed. He was withdrawn. That scared me," Senguen said.</TE>
<TE>   In late January 2000, Senguen received a letter from Jarrah. "I
thought, it was the message, that he had fallen, that he would never
come back," Senguen said. But Jarrah had written to say he would be
back soon, not revealing his whereabouts. Senguen said the letter had
a postmark from Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrah, it turns out, had been training at Al Qaeda camps in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly, in late February, he was back," she said. "He brought
traditional skirts from Pakistan and jewelry from the United [Arab]
Emirates."</TE>
<TE>   Jarrah told Senguen it "would be better for me not to know where
he had been to," she said. Afterward, Jarrah lived with her in a
small town near Stuttgart, where Senguen had moved to finish her
medical studies.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, he told me that he decided to become a pilot. He had
told me since we knew each other that he would love to be a pilot.
Already as a child, he drew planes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   They looked for a flight school in Germany or Turkey,
unsuccessfully. They made plans -- Senguen working as a doctor,
Jarrah as a pilot for Turkish Airlines, having children. Finally,
Jarrah told Senguen that he had found a school in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "I was angry that he wanted to leave again. I had a hard time when
he was gone for so long before," she said. Before he left in June
2000, Jarrah promised Senguen he would be back in less than six
months. He wasn't. Jarrah visited her several times in Germany, the
last time in January 2001. He told her repeatedly he had to return
for more training.</TE>
<TE>   Senguen said that she visited Jarrah in the U.S. and he flew her
to Key West in a small plane. She was also with him when he rented a
Boeing flight simulator in Miami in early 2001. Jarrah had urged her
not to tell anyone he was in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "But I did," she said. "I often didn't do what he told me."</TE>
<TE>   Senguen saw Jarrah for the last time in July 2001 in Germany. He
told her again he would return soon and they could marry and start
their family. He e-mailed and telephoned her almost every day.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, about noon, German time, Jarrah made his last call.
They didn't talk long.</TE>
<TE>   "He said three times, 'I love you.' When I asked, 'What's up?' he
just answered, 'I love you.' Then he hung up," Senguen said.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't know it, but minutes later Jarrah boarded Flight 93,
ending whatever dreams they had together.</TE>
<TE>   Senguen reported Jarrah missing on Sept. 13, still with some faint
hope that it wasn't really him on the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, the German federal police gave her a copy of a
letter. It was from Jarrah.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote: "The very first thing I want you to believe and always
believe, [is] that I deeply love you .... It's my mistake, to make
you hope that we [would] marry one day and have children .... I did
not run away from you, I did what I had to do, you should be proud
.... I will always be your man, Ziad."</TE>

<HD>50 Protest Shooting by LAPD Officer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 50 people protested outside Parker Center on Wednesday,
alleging that race motivated an LAPD officer who shot at a car early
Saturday, causing a crash that killed two 16-year-olds.</LD>
<LD>   "Was it because they were Latinos driving a nice car?" asked
Antonio Lopez, the stepbrother of one of the dead teens, Salvador
Sibrian.</LD>
<LD>   Some protesters carried placards displaying photographs of the
dead teens or proclaiming, "The community is terrorized by gang
members and gangsters in uniform," and "Bill Bratton control your
cops."</LD>
<TE>   Police Chief William J. Bratton, told later about the signs,
responded: "Control your kids."</TE>
<TE>   "People are not going to be pursued if they aren't engaged in
criminal activity," he said. "I have every sympathy for the family of
those who died, but at the same time I have officers who I worry
about, who are pulling up on situations where gunshots have been
fired or people are trying to flee."</TE>
<TE>   The two teenagers, Sibrian and Uriel Damien, died when the Lexus
in which they were passengers crashed into a tree after Los Angeles
Police Department Officer Tommy Thompson fired on the vehicle, said
Luis Carrillo, an attorney for the teenagers' families.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, Miguel Lopez, 19, remains in guarded condition in a
county jail ward. Carrillo said Lopez was a U.S. Marine Corps
corporal on active duty.</TE>
<TE>   Police say that Thompson fired on the Lexus after the driver
suddenly accelerated toward him. Thompson had previously been
involved in two shootings during his six-year LAPD career, both of
which were declared justified.</TE>
<TE>   Family members say the five people in the car were coming home
from a party. "This is what we're going to expect from the new LAPD,"
said Aaron Damien, Uriel's brother. "Nothing changes."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Solorzano, mother of both Salvador and Miguel, said the
youngsters were "good kids" and that Salvador was "murdered" by the
police.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting incident was one of five last weekend involving LAPD
officers. It came during a four-day period when 13 people were killed
in the city.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Bratton said that the officers' initial responses in
all five shootings appeared to be justified but that investigations
will resolve whether the officers' tactics in firing shots were
appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the deadly incident began when Thompson and his partner
heard a car alarm and saw two men standing near a parked vehicle on
53rd Street near Central Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   As the patrol car approached, the men fled, climbing a fence and
running through a vacant field. Thompson went after them on foot
while his partner drove around the block.</TE>
<TE>   As the partner drove west, he saw a white Lexus parked in the
alley. The car began to accelerate. He radioed Thompson that the
vehicle was speeding toward him.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson told investigators he was standing on the sidewalk at
1031 52nd Place when he saw the Lexus. "The Lexus struck a curb, then
stopped momentarily, apparently disabled," according to the police
account.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said he drew his service pistol and approached the
vehicle. He ordered the suspects to raise their hands, he said. At
that point, Thompson said, the driver drove at him and he fired. The
Lexus crashed a short distance later. The impact, police said, killed
Sibrian and Damien and injured the three other occupants.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the boys who died were hit by the shots -- one in the
knee and the other in the hand. They did not say where the driver was
struck by gunfire or whether any of the five were among the initial
suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Carrillo contended Wednesday that those in the car were
not the thieves. "They just got off the freeway," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Carrillo said that a bullet struck Miguel Lopez in the leg,
causing the crash.   He told the gathering of protesters, many of
them students at Manuel Arts High School, where the two dead boys
were juniors, that they were "killed by trigger-happy police."
Miguel Lopez is being held in the custody division at County-USC
Medical Center on charges of assault with a deadly weapon -- the car
-- on  Thompson.</TE>

<HD>Tough Love, or Abuse?</HD>
<DH>Sheriff's sergeant and a school principal are on trial for
stern discipline of their teenage son that allegedly escalated into
psychological abuse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grady and Deborah Machnick were distressed about their teenage son's
behavior. His chores went unfinished. His grades were slipping. He
stole money from them and shoplifted at the local supermarket.</LD>
<LD>   So the parents took drastic steps.</LD>
<LD>   Grady Machnick, a Los Angeles County sheriff's sergeant, and his
wife, an elementary school principal, locked the boy out of the house
until he finished his algebra homework. Some nights, they forced him
to sleep outside on a dog mat.</LD>
<TE>   When the boy didn't pick up after the family dogs, his stepmother
scooped up droppings from the backyard and put them in his backpack
before he went to school.</TE>
<TE>   Often, he was excluded from the dinner table, forced to eat
leftovers in the kitchen while the rest of the family dined on
fresh-cooked meals.</TE>
<TE>   The Machnicks say they did this to discipline a wayward son before
he got into even worse trouble. Prosecutors say their actions were
not only misguided but also criminal.</TE>
<TE>   The parents went on trial this week in a child-endangerment case
the likes of which prosecutors say they've never seen before. Most
child abuse involves sudden, violent acts. This case focuses on what
Orange County authorities describe as premeditated psychological
cruelty.</TE>
<TE>   Essentially, the Machnicks are accused of going overboard in their
efforts to curb their son's behavior -- efforts that, by their
account, began with "positive reinforcement" and other steps right
out of a parenting self-help book. Implicitly, the case asks the
justice system to define when parental tough love veers into
criminality.</TE>
<TE>   The Machnicks are charged with misdemeanor child endangerment and
felony conspiracy. If convicted of both offenses, they could each be
sentenced to up to three years in prison. Jury selection began
Wednesday in Superior Court in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, who have pleaded not guilty, do not dispute many of
the allegations, though they deny ever physically harming the boy,
now a 16-year-old high school junior. When authorities confronted
them last year, the parents insisted that there was a constructive
purpose behind the punishments they devised.</TE>
<TE>   "One of my biggest regrets is I was unable to find a form of
behavior modification that would work," Grady Machnick said in a
written statement released by his attorney, John Barnett. The boy
"has great potential but simply would not obey school or home rules."</TE>
<TE>   The Machnicks declined to be interviewed for this story. Barnett
says they should be applauded for caring deeply about their child's
welfare and going to great lengths to deal with his problems.</TE>
<TE>   "This building is filled with people whose parents didn't care,"
Barnett said in court recently. "These parents cared, and now they're
being prosecuted.... They were trying to do something to get his
attention, without causing physical harm."</TE>
<TE>   But in the process, authorities say, they inflicted psychological
harm. That the Machnicks were professionals trained to deal with
troublesome behavior makes their conduct all the more disturbing,
investigators say.</TE>
<TE>   "Grady is a sergeant with the Los Angeles [County] Sheriff's
Department. He should know as well as Deborah that the actions they
are taking against [the boy] are unreasonable and constitute child
abuse," said a report written by Dean Fleig, the police detective who
investigated the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Both of these people are obligated to report child abuse when it
is brought to their attention," Fleig wrote, "and they are engaging
in it themselves."</TE>
<TE>   An Ideal Setting</TE>
<TE>   The Machnicks live in a tidy, two-story home on Sunwest Circle, a
Yorba Linda cul-de-sac. The street is lined with palm trees and
manicured lawns, the kind of place where front doors are decorated
with signs that say "Welcome Friends."</TE>
<TE>   When the Machnicks moved in about five years ago, they told
neighbors they were thrilled to be living in the community. Their two
oldest children, Grady's son and daughter from a previous marriage,
became active in athletics. Their younger daughter rode horses and
took piano lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors described Deborah Machnick, 46, as a friendly person who
strolled through the neighborhood at Christmastime, passing out
holiday gifts. One year it was a bottle of wine with a decorative
label. Another year it was cookie dough with baking instructions.</TE>
<TE>   She was an elementary school principal in Walnut, most recently at
the C.J. Morris school. Deborah Machnick, who had recently earned her
doctorate in education, was known for her efforts to boost the
self-esteem of students. At back-to-school nights, she gave parents
pep talks about motivating children. She spoke about children as
future leaders and invited parents to ceremonies honoring the
school's students of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Grady Machnick, also 46, was a supervisor at the Men's Central
Jail in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The couple earned nearly $200,000 between them, drove a new Toyota
4Runner and owned a vacation cabin in the San Bernardino Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   But behind closed doors, they struggled with Grady Machnick's son,
according to interviews, court records and social-services reports.
(The Times is withholding the boy's name because he is a minor.) The
son missed family curfews, failed to complete homework assignments,
got Ds in school, neglected chores and stole.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing they did seemed to change his behavior, the parents said.</TE>
<TE>   Grady Machnick said he tried at first to use positive
reinforcement, giving his son movie tickets and cash as rewards for
good behavior.</TE>
<TE>   When that failed, the couple tried gradually stiffening their
discipline, hoping something would click. They asked their son to
sign a contract promising to improve his behavior. When he strayed,
they grounded him.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Grady Machnick concluded that more serious measures
were needed to get through to his son, whom he described to a social
worker as "one kid who pushes the limit."</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, Orange County prosecutors detailed 19 acts that
they contend amount to felony conspiracy by the Machnicks.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen of those incidents involve allegations of emotional or
psychological abuse. The parents acknowledge many of these episodes,
though they dispute certain details recounted by their son.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining three incidents involve alleged physical violence.
Grady Machnick is accused of punching his son in the stomach and
pushing him against a wall. The stepmother allegedly struck the boy
in the leg, causing a bruise. Both parents deny hitting the child.</TE>
<TE>   'We Have to Push'</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when the boy failed to clean up dog droppings in the
backyard, his stepmother confronted him and demanded that he propose
a punishment. He suggested that if it happened again, his parents
should place the droppings in his bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Machnick later told investigators she thought the idea was
reasonable and asked that he put it in writing.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few weeks, he was again failing to clean up after the
dogs. So she placed dog droppings in the boy's backpack before he
went to school. She later told a police detective that her actions
"sent the message" and the boy began cleaning up after the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to push," the stepmother said, according to a police
report.</TE>
<TE>   When the Machnicks suspected their son of stealing cash from them,
they imposed a new punishment. When Grady Machnick left for work at 4
a.m., he would roust his son from bed and escort him from the house.
The boy was not allowed back inside until his father returned from
work in the afternoon. Authorities said this policy remained in
effect for nearly 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   A detective later asked Grady Machnick how he expected the boy to
go to the bathroom if he was locked out of the house. The father
replied: "There's the park down the way. That's open 24 hours."</TE>
<TE>   The teenager told authorities that his stepmother took photos of
him nude and threatened to plaster them around school if his behavior
didn't improve. Deborah Machnick told investigators she took the
photographs to make a point about his behavior but said her
recollection was that he was wearing underwear at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The parents also removed all the belongings from the boy's room,
including his clothing, and forced him to earn them back with good
behavior, according to social services documents.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Deborah Machnick decided to tutor the boy in algebra.
She gave him about five pages of additional algebra each night beyond
his school-assigned homework. She told him to finish the work in the
backyard. He was allowed to come inside only after he had done so.</TE>
<TE>   "He was failing algebra, and we were trying to build him up," she
told a social worker.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the boy spent the night in the backyard, sleeping on a
dog mat while the dogs slept in the house. The parents told
investigators their son was to blame for failing to finish his
homework. "Five pages isn't too much to ask of him in 14 to 16
hours," the father said, according to investigators' reports.</TE>
<TE>   Living With Friends</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, the boy ran away. He arrived at his best friend's
house after 1 a.m., his hair soaking wet. He told his friend that his
father had awakened him by dousing him with several gallons of water
to punish him for returning home late from school the day before.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, the friend's family told police that the Machnicks'
son was living with them. When a detective interviewed Grady Machnick
about his treatment of the boy, the father's first words were: "He
didn't commit any crimes, did he?"</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, when a social worker told him his son wanted to
come home, Machnick said he would take him back only if he could
continue with his disciplinary regimen, a county social worker
reported. Authorities placed the boy in the custody of the best
friend's family.</TE>
<TE>   Social worker Curtis Vaughn, who spent weeks investigating the
case, concluded that "father and stepmother have totally failed in
their parental duties to inform and instruct the child."</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, somebody in charge of young impressionable students
could have thought of a more efficacious way to [deal with] the
child's laxity in scooping dog feces at home," Vaughn said in a
report.</TE>
<TE>   Most cases of alleged child abuse involve neglect or a pattern of
violence by parents who lose control, experts said. "This is not at
all typical," said Duncan Lindsey, a professor of child welfare at
UCLA. "In most child abuse that's reported, parents [are] not
adequately caring for their children."</TE>
<TE>   After charges were filed, , the Sheriff's Department placed Grady
Machnick on unpaid leave. The Walnut Unified School District relieved
Deborah Machnick of her principal's duties, shifting her to an
administrative post in which she has no contact with children.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned parents at C.J. Morris had called the district to find
out what was happening with Deborah Machnick.</TE>
<TE>   "It was upsetting to a lot of the moms," said Julie Holguin,
parent of a second-grader at the school. "If she could do that with
her own child, what gives her the right to be there with anybody
else's child?"</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles County Jail, deputies said they had a hard time
believing the allegations against Grady Machnick, whom they described
as a fair and caring supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "People were very shocked. I was very shocked. Having worked for
him five years and knowing the type of person he is, I couldn't
believe these allegations," said Deputy Jennifer Haller.</TE>
<TE>   But teens in the Machnicks' neighborhood said they knew something
was wrong. The Machnicks' son used to wander to friends' homes at
10:30 p.m. on school nights, saying he had no place to go. On rainy
days, they'd watch Deborah Machnick drive off to work, leaving her
son behind to make the 15-minute walk to school. "My mom would stop
and give him a ride," said Mike Preston, the boy's friend and former
neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Pride and Frustration</TE>
<TE>   In a photocopied letter they sent out with their Christmas cards
last year, the Machnicks gushed about their two daughters, their new
mountain home, even the family dogs, which "still provide us love and
laughter."</TE>
<TE>   The tone changed when the subject turned to their teenage son. He
had moved out of the house because "our household expectations were
too much for him," the couple told their family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times," they wrote, "when parenthood seems like nothing
but feeding the mouth that bites you."</TE>

<HD>Get Angry, Bratton Tells L.A.</HD>
<DH>Sixteen homicides in six days should provoke outrage and
move city residents and police to action, the chief says of the rash
of violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan Garvey and Jessica Garrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton issued a challenge to the
city Wednesday, saying that six straight days of killings must
provoke residents and law officers to fight back.</LD>
<LD>   The new chief said the 16 homicides and five officer-involved
shootings since Friday evening -- mostly in South Los Angeles --
marked a rising crime trend that has been ignored by much of the rest
of the city.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very disturbed and angry," he said in an interview. "I need
this city angry about gangbangers shaping the perception of Los
Angeles."</LD>
<TE>   The rash of killings, the first major test for Bratton as chief,
comes near the close of one of the most violent years in recent Los
Angeles history, with the city bucking decreases in serious crime
seen in other major U.S. cities.</TE>
<TE>   There have been 594 homicides in Los Angeles so far this year,
compared with 587 for all of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1990s, homicides in Los Angeles peaked at 1,092 in 1992
and fell to a decade low of 419 in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Police say there is no simple explanation for the increase.</TE>
<TE>   The killings of the last few days -- the result of more than a
dozen shootings -- are believed to be tied to numerous gang
rivalries, some internal, officers said.</TE>
<TE>   The shootings that began Friday evening were described by Bratton
as "tit-for-tat" violence against gang members and passersby.</TE>
<TE>   "People will think nothing of shooting at someone because they
looked at them wrong or were wearing the wrong color or drove by at
the wrong time," the chief said.</TE>
<TE>   Other officers said much of the recent violence has been carried
out by a new generation of young men eager to prove their courage.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, hired by Mayor James K. Hahn this fall to reduce crime in
the city, said the community should not blame police.</TE>
<TE>   "I read today one woman saying it was the police's fault," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the police's fault. The community has a degree of fault
to share -- there are places in this city where values have broken
down, there are fourth- and fifth-generation gang members."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's comments, made in an interview at his downtown office,
came just hours before his second in command, Assistant Chief Jim
McDonnell, announced that detectives in South Los Angeles have been
instructed to respond, in addition to patrol officers, to all
shootings that result in injury or death.</TE>
<TE>   One of Bratton's first actions as chief was to augment the police
presence in South Los Angeles, where 44% of the city's homicides have
occurred this year.</TE>
<TE>   The department is hoping to forge better ties with the black
population living south of the Santa Monica Freeway. The community
has long had a troubled relationship with the LAPD and was upset by
Hahn's ouster of former Chief Bernard C. Parks earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, who is black, was criticized by Hahn for failing to stem
crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to work closely with the community," said McDonnell,
flanked by activists in a courtyard at the 77th Street Division
station, many of whom stayed for a community summit.</TE>
<TE>   The wave of violence crested over the weekend, with 14 deaths from
Friday to Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday night, a man was fatally shot on Wilshire Boulevard
near Sycamore Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Hours earlier in South Los Angeles, seven more people were shot in
three separate attacks that took place within blocks of each other.</TE>
<TE>   A youth, Ernest Williams, 17, was killed. Two were critically
wounded and four others sustained gunshot wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they do not believe Williams was a gang member and may
have been a victim of mistaken identity.</TE>
<TE>   By Wednesday, two suspected assailants were in custody on
unrelated charges.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton described many of the city's violent criminals as "mental
nitwits who don't have the same value systems as you and I."</TE>
<TE>   He said the ready availability of guns is fueling Los Angeles'
spiraling crime rate.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, homicides in New York, where Bratton served as
commissioner in the early 1990s, have fallen by 12% from last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Existing laws are not adequate to control guns in this city,"
Bratton said. "Too many people here are comfortable carrying
[illegal] guns."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he believes stiffer local laws will help get more
guns off the street. He has asked a consultant to help draft such
legislation for city and state officials to consider.</TE>
<TE>   The chief in recent days has visited shooting scenes to see the
aftermath of violence for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be there," he said at a press briefing this week. "I
want to feel angry."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said Wednesday that one of his primary responsibilities as
chief will be to get residents throughout the city -- including areas
untouched by serious crime -- to share his outrage over the killings.</TE>
<TE>   He outlined what he said must be a collaborative effort between
the community and law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Since being sworn in to the top LAPD job last month, Bratton has
asked his officers to practice "assertive policing," taking action
when they see laws being broken, whether it is a weapons violation or
drinking in public.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton describes the new mandate as a shift in recent police
behavior in Los Angeles, where the repercussions of the Rampart
scandal and a strict disciplinary system he immediately eased made
many officers reluctant to do their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "We had officers who were going about their job with blinders on,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd respond to their 911 calls and, if they saw a kid on the
street corner with a bulge in their waistband that looked like a gun,
they'd keep on going."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who says racial profiling has no place in law
enforcement, made this promise: "If you are doing what you are
supposed to be doing, you will never attract the attention of the
police."</TE>
<TE>   But he said if the community wants Los Angeles police officers to
do their jobs, it must accept tools available to police such as "stop
and frisk" laws that allow officers to search suspects on the street.</TE>
<TE>   In South Los Angeles, community members said they want an end to
the killing.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is much bigger than the police," said the Rev.
Frederick O. Murph of Brookins Community African Methodist Episcopal
Church.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to do with jobs and opportunity. Until we begin to address
the real issue, nothing is going to change. The police is a Band-Aid
on a real bad wound."</TE>
<TE>   "Sweet" Alice Harris, a community activist who has
enthusiastically embraced the new chief, said: "We are watching our
children die like dogs.... We have to stop this."</TE>

<HD>16 Shooting Victims Will 'Never Have That Chance' for

<LD>Eliseo Rodriguez Moreno, 28, an immigrant from Mexico who worked his
way up to supervisor at a jukebox factory, had just stepped out of
his car in his driveway at 4 a.m. Monday when the bullets found him.</LD>
<LD>   Ernest Williams, 17, a high school student, was going around the
corner to see a friend Tuesday evening. He wound up scurrying beneath
a parked car, where the bullets found him.</LD>
<LD>   In six days, 16 people have died in a spree of homicides
throughout South Los Angeles. Their deaths have left bitter and
grieving families who liken the streets of Los Angeles to a war-torn
country.</LD>
<TE>   "In this neighborhood, it's like Vietnam. It's like nobody cares,"
said Robert Williams, the father of victim Ernest Williams. "We go
over to other countries and fight, but our own neighborhoods are like
war zones."</TE>
<TE>   Williams was a churchgoing youth, always smiling, and had no
apparent connection to gangs, said his father, who has lived on 84th
Place for 14 years and seen many violent deaths in that time.</TE>
<TE>   "I have three sons, but he was the baby of the family," Williams
said. "He was not a gangbanger. He was a great kid. He was always
smiling, and he was going to graduate from high school in the spring.
He wanted to be a real estate agent and make a lot of money. Now,
he'll never have that chance."</TE>
<TE>   Miles south of the Williams home, on 204th Street, the Rodriguez
family was arranging to bring the body of Eliseo Rodriguez Moreno
back to his home state of Sinaloa, Mexico -- a place that has its own
bloody legacy of drug violence -- where his mother and six brothers
live.</TE>
<TE>   Family members said Rodriguez had immigrated nine years ago,
mastered English and become a factory supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   In his free time, he roughhoused with his nephews, ages 4 to 11,
and went to dance halls, his brother said. Each weekend night,
Rodriguez dressed up in vaquero attire -- cowboy hat, dark jeans,
boots and leather jacket -- and hit the South Los Angeles dance
floors. One night he met his future fiancee. They became engaged two
weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard the shots," his brother, Sergio Rodriguez, said. "I told
my wife, 'I just hope this isn't what I think it is.' But when I got
outside, there was my brother lying all in blood beside his car. You
can still see the shadow of the blood on the sidewalk."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said that in the 12 years he has lived in the
neighborhood, police from Los Angeles and nearby Torrance don't seem
interested in stopping increasing street violence. Two years ago,
Rodriguez said, he was shot by gang members who came into the area
from another neighborhood. Police came, he said, but the
investigation seemed perfunctory.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Lopez, 19, hadn't been in Los Angeles long enough to be in
a gang, said his aunt, Maria Lopez, who took him in eight months ago
in the converted garage apartment on West 60th Street where she lives
with her husband.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday evening, Lopez went two doors down to chat with
neighbors. As he sat in a chair outside their house, two men
approached and opened fire, neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard them say, 'Hey, man!' and they started shooting. I don't
know why," said neighbor Erika Lopez, who is not related to the
family. "I heard the gunshots, and my husband ran out because Daniel
was out there," Maria Lopez said. "That's when he saw that Daniel had
been hit."</TE>
<TE>   His body will be sent to Zihuatanejo, in his native state of
Jalisco, Mexico, for burial. He had a 5-month-old son, born to his
girlfriend there, whom he had never seen.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham Olazabal, 19, graduated from South Gate High School in
2001 and was attending a technical college in Torrance with hopes of
becoming a computer draftsman. He died of multiple gunshots at 2:35
p.m. Monday in the 300 block of West 13th Street in San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   Police said his death might have been gang-related, a notion that
infuriates his family.</TE>
<TE>   "Not at all," said Yolanda Palacio, a cousin who drove from
Modesto to be with Olazabal's grieving parents. "He was just a great
kid, and we're really appalled. Some newspapers said this was
gang-related, but he had no affiliation to gangs, had nothing to do
with gang activity. He had no enemies."</TE>
<TE>   "Go to school, go to his girlfriend's house, go to the gym, that's
all he did," said sister Erika, 16.</TE>
<TE>   Olazabal also left a 3-year-old sister and a 12-year-old brother.
On Tuesday, friends and family brought food and flowers to his
family's home in South Gate.</TE>
<TE>   "His mom, you can't console her," Palacio said. "She can't explain
it. No one can explain it."</TE>
<TE>   At the home of Juan Gabriel Valenzuela on Compton Avenue in Los
Angeles, family members bitterly shooed away reporters and said they
did not want to talk about the Sunday morning shooting that left
Valenzuela dead.</TE>
<TE>   Like the other murder scenes, this one was adorned with flowers
left by well-wishers.</TE>
<TE>   Candles and flowers also decked the sidewalk on North Wilton
Avenue in Hollywood, where Willie Yee Alfonso, 27, was killed Sunday.
No one nearby knew much about the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The other victims include:</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzo Romero, 29, 420 block of West 99th Street, shot in the
chest in the 2500 block of South Raymond Avenue in Los Angeles at
6:30 p.m. Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Isiah Samuel Moore Jr., 41, unknown address, died of a stab wound
to the chest in the frontyard of a residence in the 400 block of East
41st Street, Los Angeles, at midnight Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Antonio Corrales, 25, last known address in the 640 block of
South Downey Road, Los Angeles, died of multiple gunshot wounds at
Cerano Avenue and Beverly Boulevard in Hollywood at 8:24 p.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Jose S. Perez, 25, last known address in the 2550 block of Cole
Place, Huntington Park, died of multiple gunshots at the same place
and time as Olazabal.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry Smith Jr., 33, last known address in the 11900 block of
Centralia Street in Hawaiian Gardens, died of a shotgun wound to the
head at 12:30 a.m. Sunday at a warehouse in the 6000 block of South
Broadway in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Five other victims remain unidentified.</TE>

<HD>F/A-22 Program Likely to Be Scaled Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Hendren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Faced with an unexpected $690-million cost overrun in its troubled
F/A-22 fighter program, the Pentagon may slash the number of planes
it purchases from Lockheed Martin Corp., a senior official said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The development is an embarrassment for the Air Force and for
Lockheed Martin, which designed the plane at its Skunk Works facility
in Burbank. The program has seen rising costs and recent management
shake-ups.</LD>
<LD>   With about 250 aerospace contractors across Southern California
making up a large share of the F/A-22 "Raptor" work force, cuts in
the program are expected to have ramifications for the region's
economy, even though the plane's assembly plant is in Marietta, Ga.</LD>
<TE>   Lockheed has said the value of the F/A-22 contract to Southland
suppliers -- from Raytheon Corp. in El Segundo, where engineers
developed the main computer for the aircraft, to BAE Systems'
electronics group in Santa Monica -- could surpass $11 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The Air Force has repeatedly stated that it has a requirement of
at least 381 Raptors," Lockheed spokesman Greg Caires said. "Lockheed
Martin and the contractor team, however, are prepared to build
however many F/A-22s the Pentagon decides to buy."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Pentagon nor Air Force officials anticipated the cost
overrun in the Lockheed Martin program, according to Edward Aldridge,
the Pentagon's senior acquisition official. Problems in the program
have already caused the Pentagon and one contractor to replace their
project management teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not happy, nor was the Air Force," Aldridge told reporters.
"One of the ways you pay for it is reduce the number of airplanes,
and that may be what we have to do."</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear what led to the added costs of the F/A-22, but
Aldridge said some speculate that testing of the plane has been
slower and more problematic than expected. A sophisticated fighter
that can fly at supersonic speed without using fuel-guzzling
afterburners, the Raptor is meant to be the Air Force's fighter for
the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon initially planned to buy 750 of the planes at about
$35 million each when it was proposed in 1985. It slashed that number
to 648 aircraft in 1991, to 438 in 1993 and to 339 in 1999, raising
the per-plane cost to $99 million, a Lockheed official said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon and Lockheed replaced the managers in charge of the
program this week. On Monday the Air Force replaced Brig. Gen.
William Jabour, the program executive officer for fighter and bomber
programs, and Brig. Gen. Mark Shackleford, the systems program
officer, with Brig. Gen. Richard Lewis and Col. Thomas Owen. On
Tuesday, Lockheed replaced program manager Bob Rearden with Ralph
Heath.</TE>
<TE>   Critics want the Air Force to cut F/A-22 purchases and instead buy
newer models of the F-15, a tactical fighter designed to give the Air
Force superiority in aerial combat, saying it would be less
expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Despite praise as a stealthy, long-range bomber, the F/A-22 has
been rife with controversy from the day in 1991 when Lockheed beat
out Northrop Grumman Corp.'s proposed YF-23 in a competition to
replace the aging F-15, first made 30 years ago. Originally called
the F-22, it was renamed the F/A-22, adding the "A" to reflect its
capacity for ground attack.</TE>

<HD>Antiabortion Activist Admits Killing Doctor Near Buffalo</HD>
<DH>Awaiting trial in the sniper slaying of Barnett Slepian,
James Kopp says he meant to wound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>An antiabortion activist charged with killing Dr. Barnett A. Slepian
four years ago admitted the sniper slaying but said he only wanted to
wound the obstetrician to vent his anger.</LD>
<LD>   "The truth is not that I regret shooting Dr. Slepian. I regret
that he died," James C. Kopp said in a jailhouse interview published
Wednesday in the Buffalo News. "I aimed at his shoulder. The bullet
took a crazy ricochet, and that's what killed him."</LD>
<LD>   Kopp said that he had planned the attack for a year and had
repeatedly scouted the 52-year-old physician's suburban neighborhood
near Buffalo, N.Y., before firing the single rifle shot that killed
Slepian in his kitchen on Oct. 23, 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Kopp, 47, who was on the FBI's most wanted list until his capture
in France in March 2001, said he picked Slepian's name out of a
telephone book that listed doctors performing abortions.</TE>
<TE>   He told the newspaper that before selecting Slepian he scouted the
homes of about six other doctors. A key factor in his decision was
that Slepian's home had a rear window facing woods.</TE>
<TE>   Kopp is scheduled to go to trial in February on charges of
second-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   He told the two Buffalo News reporters who interviewed him with
his lawyer present that he wanted to confess because his supporters
wanted to know his reasons for the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that would be worse, to me, would be to do nothing
and allow abortions to continue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "One of my goals was to keep Dr. Slepian alive, and I failed in
that goal."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce A. Barket, who is defending Kopp, said that his client
issued the message he wanted to and that he would seek to prove
during the trial that Kopp didn't intend to kill the doctor.</TE>
<TE>   A key piece of evidence at the trial is expected to be DNA from a
toothbrush Kopp used months before the shooting and a hair found at
the crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses are expected to testify that Kopp's car was seen in
Slepian's neighborhood and that he had a map with directions to the
pawn shop in Tennessee where the rifle was purchased.</TE>
<TE>   Pro- and antiabortion rights groups condemned Kopp's confession.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood, labeled him a
"terrorist" who was attempting to sway the media.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Flip Benham, director of Operation Save America, said
that Kopp had "betrayed the pro-life movement."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Robert Caro on Wednesday won the National Book Award for "Master of
the Senate: The Years of Lyndon Johnson," his third book on the life
of the late president.</LD>
<LD>   Caro, who is working on a fourth and his intended last book on
Johnson, said in a statement read at the National Book Foundation
award ceremony here that people often ask if he gets bored spending
so much time on one person.</LD>
<LD>   "I consider each of my four books studies on political power, how
it is acquired and how it is used," he said. "If you care about
political power, every day with LBJ is an eye-opening day.... Every
day I learn something I'd never thought of."</LD>
<TE>   Winning in the fiction category was Julia Glass for her first
novel, "Three Junes," about three summers in the lives of a Scottish
family.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Stone won the poetry award for her collection "In the Next
Galaxy."</TE>
<TE>   Winning at age 87, she said, "I think they probably gave it to me
because I'm old.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been writing poetry, or whatever it is, since I was 5 or 6
years old," Stone said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why I did it. It was like a stream alongside me. It
just talks to me, and I write it down."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Farmer won the award for young people's literature for "The
House of the Scorpion."</TE>
<TE>   Philip Roth, author of "Goodbye, Columbus," "Portnoy's Complaint"
and "American Pastoral," received an award for distinguished
contribution to American letters.</TE>

<HD>More Election Ballots Ordered Counted</HD>
<DH>Votes in Colorado could change fortunes in a new district
where a Republican leads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>A judge on Wednesday ordered all provisional ballots to be counted in
the still-undecided 7th Congressional District, a small victory for
the Democratic candidate trailing in the race.</LD>
<LD>   Republican Bob Beauprez is 386 votes ahead of Democrat Mike Feeley
in the contest to become the first representative of the new district
in the metropolitan Denver area.</LD>
<LD>   Three counties have yet to certify their provisional ballots, cast
by voters whose names did not appear on official voter-registration
rolls. It was the state's first election to feature the special
ballots.</LD>
<TE>   Feeley filed a lawsuit saying election officials in Arapahoe,
Jefferson and Adams counties did not use the same standards to decide
whether the ballots were valid.</TE>
<TE>   One county counted all the provisional ballots whose voters were
found to be qualified; the two others threw out all ballots whose
voters failed to check a box and explain why they voted under the
special circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Denver District Judge William Robbins ruled that all the ballots
cast by qualified voters should be counted, explanation or no.</TE>
<TE>   "The short delay in completing the count until the validity of
these ballots is determined harms no party to this election," the
judge wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Results were expected to be announced today.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,300 provisional ballots cast in the counties were expected
to affect the 7th District race. Feeley's advisors said the decision
will affect at most 158 provisional ballots that were not being
counted in Adams and Arapahoe counties.</TE>
<TE>   Feeley said the court decision will probably result in a recount
mandated by state law.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make sure the votes were counted. It's certainly
about as close as it can get," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Party executive director Alan Philp said the party has
not decided whether to appeal to the state Supreme Court within the
three-day limit.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed in the court's opinion. We are weighing our
options and waiting to see if the secretary of state is going to
appeal," Philp said.</TE>

<HD>For All Congress Did, Much Goes Undone</HD>
<DH>Many of the gains made by the 107th session on such issues
as terrorism, corruption in businesses and campaign finance reform
fell victim to later developments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The 107th Congress, which ends this week, leaves a rich legacy of
legislation to combat terrorism, corporate corruption and the
influence of money in politics. But many of its signal achievements
have been undercut by subsequent developments, leaving both parties
with a record that critics call hollow.</LD>
<LD>   Spurred by the searing events of Sept. 11, lawmakers passed
landmark legislation to create a new Department of Homeland Security,
combat bioterrorism and shore up port security. But Congress still
has not provided the increased funding needed to pay for these new
anti-terrorism initiatives.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to a spate of business scandals, Congress passed a
far-reaching bill to crack down on accounting abuses and strengthen
the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the newly established
oversight board is off to a bad start, its chief driven from office
along with beleaguered SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt.</LD>
<TE>   While 2002 began with passage of a major campaign finance reform
bill, the law's impact has been muted by regulations issued by the
Federal Election Commission. And by the time the law took effect,
both major political parties were devising ways to get around its key
provision.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the reforms that seemed so substantial may turn out, in
practice, to be less substantial," said Catherine Rudder, a professor
of public policy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.</TE>
<TE>   This two-year session of Congress -- which has completed its major
business and is expected to officially adjourn Friday -- did rack up
major accomplishments. It passed President Bush's $1.35-trillion,
10-year tax cut, an education reform plan and several major bills in
response to last year's terrorist attacks. But when Congress, with
its slim Republican majority in the House and one-seat Democratic
majority in the Senate, turned to nagging long-term domestic
problems, lawmakers came up largely empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   Among the issues untouched or left undone: reform of Social
Security and Medicare to accommodate the approaching wave of
baby-boomer retirements; a rewrite of energy policy; new rules to
strengthen patients' rights; the future of welfare reform, and
pension protections for 401(k) investors.</TE>
<TE>   "Our failure to be able to pass any long-term structural changes
is extremely significant," said Stephen Bell, an aide to Sen. Pete V.
Domenici (R-N.M.). Bell called lawmakers "paralyzed" by the narrow
political divide in Congress "and by the growth of scar tissue ...
after years of intense partisan warfare."</TE>
<TE>   Those factors have not been significantly changed by the 2002
elections, so the prospects for long-term structural policy changes
may remain dim.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have seized control of the new Senate and expanded
their House majority, but their majority margins remain thin. That
will make it difficult for the 108th Congress to act decisively on
long-range domestic problems.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, partisan warfare may intensify in the coming session
if Democrats conclude that the best response to the midterm elections
is to turn more sharply to the left.</TE>
<TE>   Along with what it did and did not accomplish, the 107th Congress
was marked by the transformation of Bush's relationship with Capitol
Hill. The session began in early 2001 with Democrats questioning the
legitimacy of his presidency; it ended with Bush's agenda dominating
Congress in its lame-duck session.</TE>
<TE>   That changed dynamic flowed from the events of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "This Congress is going to be known as the 9/11 Congress," said
Roger H. Davidson, emeritus professor of government at the University
of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   After last year's tax cut, most of the major bills that passed
were in response to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon. Measures to finance the war in Afghanistan,
increase airport security and provide new law enforcement tools to
track down terrorists were quickly approved. The bioterrorism
legislation soon followed. The lame-duck session delivered the bill
to create the Department of Homeland Security, federal backup
insurance against damages caused by terrorist acts, and the bill to
increase security at the nation's ports.</TE>
<TE>   That agenda essentially crowded out or eclipsed domestic issues
that had been front and center. Legislation to give patients more
leverage in their dealings with HMOs was sidetracked. Efforts to
provide a prescription drug benefit through Medicare stalled. Bush's
domestic priorities -- welfare reform and aid to social services
provided by faith-based institutions -- foundered.</TE>
<TE>   "Very important legislative matters have been swept off the
agenda," Rudder said.</TE>
<TE>   There were exceptions. The spate of business scandals propelled
into law the campaign finance and accounting reform bills. But
implementation of those laws has fallen short of the hopes of their
authors.</TE>
<TE>   The corporate oversight board set up by the accounting bill has
been sputtering in the wake of the resignation of Pitt and the
board's first chief, William H. Webster, just a few weeks after he
was appointed. The resignations were the result of controversy over
Pitt's failure to tell other SEC commissioners about Webster's role
in auditing a company accused of fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Outgoing Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.C.) argued
Wednesday that the corporate reform bill will, in the end, be one of
the "most far-reaching measures" of this Congress.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that the campaign finance bill would cause "a sea
change in the way campaigns are run" as a result of its ban on
so-called soft money: unregulated contributions to national parties
by unions, corporations and individuals.</TE>
<TE>   But even as political operatives explore ways to circumvent the
ban, the law faces a court challenge that many expect will nullify
key parts of it.</TE>
<TE>   John J. Pitney Jr., a professor of government at Claremont McKenna
College, said such developments illustrate the limits of Congress'
ability to legislate reform. "As soon as you invent a better
mousetrap, the mice get smarter," Pitney said.</TE>
<TE>   One of Congress' most striking lapses this year was its failure to
pass 11 of the 13 appropriation bills needed to finance the
government. Instead, it put off until next month making spending
choices for a budget year that is already almost 2 months old.
Congress passed a "continuing resolution," which extended until Jan.
11 spending levels that were set a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The result, critics in both major political parties say, is to
delay funding increases for a wide array of programs that emerged as
priorities after the terrorist attacks. For example, billions of
dollars in increases planned for the Coast Guard, Customs Service and
other agencies involved in homeland security have been postponed.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the FBI has not acted on plans to hire additional
intelligence analysts and researchers, which had been proposed to
beef up its anti-terrorism apparatus.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, big increases authorized for the SEC in the wake of
the business scandals have not come through. The Senate
Appropriations Committee voted this year to boost the commission's
budget to $750 million; under the stopgap funding resolution, it
remains at $467 million.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Call, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget,
said federal agencies are coping with the funding freeze without
major problems but acknowledged that it was slowing the start of new
initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   All that leaves a full plate for the GOP-controlled Congress that
convenes Jan. 7. Asked Wednesday what the Senate would do next year,
incoming Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) offered a menu
of legislative leftovers -- pension reform, prescription drug
benefits for Medicare, energy legislation -- plus such GOP favorites
as tax cuts, limits on medical malpractice lawsuits and a ban on the
procedure critics call partial-birth abortion.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of what we do next year is to finish the work that's
undone," Lott said. "There's no use trying to fix blame, but the fact
of the matter is a lot of important things that needed to be done
were not done."</TE>

<HD>New York Floats a Plan to Place Homeless on Board Cruise
Ships</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- They've slept on office floors, in jails and on school
buses that take them to and from shelters at 3 a.m. But now homeless
people in New York City might get a new place to spend the night --
on cruise ships.</LD>
<LD>   City officials, faced with a rapidly expanding number of homeless
and a court order that requires New York to provide temporary shelter
for any person who needs it, have come up with the novel plan to use
old cruise ships as just one of several solutions to a chronic
housing shortage.</LD>
<LD>   Linda Gibbs, homeless services commissioner, flew to the Bahamas
on Wednesday along with other top aides on Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg's private jet to inspect several such ships. The expedition
is "just a fact-finding mission, extremely preliminary," said her
spokesman, Jim Anderson.</LD>
<TE>   "The trip is to determine if the ships would be safe and
applicable to shelter homeless clients," he said.</TE>
<TE>   New York has more than 36,000 homeless people, the highest number
in years, according to the Coalition for the Homeless. And although
Bloomberg has dismissed the notion that the problem is getting worse,
New York has been hard-pressed to find suitable housing for this
growing population.</TE>
<TE>   More than 16,000 of them are under the age of 18, and an
additional 12,000 are mothers, according to agency figures. The city
will conduct a census of the homeless this winter in an effort to
arrive at a more accurate number.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I'd heard it all when it comes to New York dealing with
the homeless, but I guess I haven't," said Patrick Markee, senior
policy analyst with the coalition. "I think most New Yorkers will
hear this latest idea and say to themselves, 'There's got to be a
better way than using cruise ships,' and of course there is."</TE>
<TE>   New York is paying "a very stiff price" for the nearly 40% cutback
in temporary housing assistance programs mandated by the previous
administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, he said. Bloomberg has
pledged to restore much of that funding, including renovation of
city-funded apartments and federal Section 8 housing assistance
programs, Markee added, "but right now we have an exploding homeless
population and we need real programs to help them."</TE>
<TE>   As of Oct. 31, the city operated 125 family shelters -- all filled
to capacity -- in the five boroughs. Although the notion of putting
homeless people on cruise ships may seem farfetched, New York has
floated a similar idea before. In the early 1990s, city officials put
several thousand homeless families on empty, little-used jail barges
in the East River. The plan was shot down by a court, which ruled the
ships an inappropriate site.</TE>
<TE>   New York did, however, put prisoners on a converted barge in the
early 1990s, to ease jail overcrowding, and the same ship was
reopened in 1998 as a place to put juvenile offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Exploring other options, the city has worked with several social
service providers to open 18 new homeless shelters in failing hotels.
The program has triggered angry opposition, however, from neighbors
and community leaders who in many cases have said they didn't know
about the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the city put homeless families in a Bronx jail as a
stopgap measure. They spent 45 days there until a court ruled that
the jail should not have been used for housing.</TE>
<TE>   While New York officials did not disclose the potential costs
involved in acquiring and renovating old cruise ships, officials have
indicated that the price could be less than that of New York real
estate, which is at record high levels. Most of the cruise ships
being inspected would house from 1,000 to 3,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't reject any idea that's being offered," Gibbs told
WNBC-TV. "I think we have to be unafraid to think creatively and to
explore options that maybe haven't been looked at in the past."</TE>

<HD>Daschle Fears a Political Shrillness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Political discussion in the United States has taken on a shrill edge
that has encouraged an increasing number of threats against public
officials, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.C.) said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Daschle told reporters that the "very shrill edge" taken on by
many radio and television talk show hosts has turned politics into
entertainment and can spark an emotional response in people.</LD>
<LD>   "What happens when [radio talk show host] Rush Limbaugh attacks
those of us in public life is that people aren't satisfied just to
listen," Daschle said. "They want to act, because they get
emotionally invested. And so, you know, the threats to those of us in
public life go up dramatically, on our families and on us, in a way
that's very disconcerting."</LD>
<TE>   Daschle, whose office was a target in last year's anthrax mail
attacks, declined to go into detail about the nature of the threats.</TE>
<TE>   But he said that when he was accused by Republicans of being an
obstructionist, the number of threats against him and his family
rose.</TE>
<TE>   "If entertainment becomes so much a part of politics and if that
entertainment drives an emotional movement in this country among some
people who don't know the difference between entertainment and
politics, and who are then so energized to go out and hurt somebody,
that troubles me about where politics in America is going," Daschle
said.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), asked about Daschle's
remarks, said he did not agree that political discussion had taken on
a shrill edge for entertainment purposes and was not aware of any
increase in the number of threats.</TE>

<HD>Gore Plans Bolder Race in 2004 -- if He Runs</HD>
<DH>Democrat to announce his decision by early next year. He
admits to mistakes in 2000 campaign and steps up his criticism of
Bush.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Vice President Al Gore, as he nears a decision on whether to
seek the presidency again, has begun formulating plans for a possible
campaign that would be much more informal in style and more ambitious
in its ideas than his unsuccessful race in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview with The Times on Wednesday, Gore said that if he
runs he would "do it in a very different way" by devoting most of his
time to small meetings and "relaxed conversations" with individuals
and families. And he said he would offer bolder ideas, like his
recent endorsement of a single-payer system that would fundamentally
restructure health care in America.</LD>
<LD>   "I think I made a lot of mistakes in 2000, and among them was at
times holding back because of respect for the need to have a
politically viable set of positions that could attract a majority,"
Gore said.</LD>
<TE>   Gore spoke during a weeklong media blitz that has included
appearances on the major television networks. The appearances have
been tied to the release of a new book on American families
coauthored with his wife, Tipper, but have also served to reintroduce
him to the public as he approaches a decision on the 2004 campaign
that he says he will announce by early next year.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, Gore was confident and relaxed, whether in
critiquing President Bush's record or his own performance in the 2000
race.</TE>
<TE>   After maintaining a low profile for more than a year following his
razor-thin defeat, Gore has escalated his criticism of Bush recently,
a trend that continued emphatically in the interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I think by every objective measure the country is worse off:
economically, in terms of the threat to our national security that we
face on a daily basis, in terms of the environment, health care,
education, pensions, Social Security -- really across the board,"
Gore said.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan dismissed the comments as
"posturing" and said that Bush was making progress against problems
at home and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Gore has faced open skepticism about a possible 2004 candidacy
from many Democratic Party insiders, who believe he squandered a
winning hand in 2000 and retreated from the fray too long in the
aftermath. A recent Times poll that found almost half the members of
the Democratic National Committee surveyed would prefer that Gore not
run again.</TE>
<TE>   But polls consistently show Gore drawing much more support than
any potential 2004 rival among rank-and-file Democrats: In a Time/CNN
survey last week, 53% of Democrats said they would back Gore in 2004,
more than five times as many as named any other possible candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Partly, Gore's lead reflects the fact that he's much better known
than potential rivals, such as Sens. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts
and John Edwards of North Carolina. But Gore also still draws
passionate support from many grass-roots Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night, for instance, several hundred admirers waited as
long as four hours outside Brentano's bookstore in Century City,
where Gore and his wife were signing copies of their new book,
"Joined at the Heart," which examines American family life.</TE>
<TE>   Gore has said he won't decide whether to run until late this year
and won't announce his decision until early January. But in the
interview, he indicated that if he runs, he's resigned to attracting
less institutional support than in 2000, when virtually all elected
officials, most of the top fund-raisers and organized labor backed
him for the Democratic nomination against former Sen. Bill Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Running again without as many tangible political assets, Gore
said, would be "both a problem and liberating."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it appears that if Gore runs, he is planning a campaign
that would look more like an insurgency than the well-funded behemoth
typical of the candidate leading in the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the party owes me anything because of the 2000
election," Gore said.</TE>
<TE>   While writing his new book, Gore and his wife visited with
families around the country for in-depth conversations, and he said
that if he runs again he would try to re-create those encounters as
much as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, he added, "I will spend whatever time is necessary to
find the words straight from my own heart about the challenges the
country is facing."</TE>
<TE>   Gore said he would cancel the further reductions in tax rates for
affluent families scheduled for 2004 and 2006 and redirect the money
toward tax cuts for the middle class as well as new spending on
education, infrastructure and scientific research.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Buchan said: "Private economists agree that the tax
cut was well-timed and was a factor in the recession being one of the
shortest and shallowest ever."</TE>
<TE>   Gore was searing in his criticism of Bush's foreign policy,
arguing that the administration's focus on confronting Iraq President
Saddam Hussein has endangered American security by distracting
attention from the pursuit of Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is any question that we lost focus on the war
against terrorism and that the risk to our country has been increased
as a direct result of the decision made ... to start a new war and
campaign all over the country on the basis of that new war," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Buchan also dismissed that charge: "On Iraq, the president is
uniting the country and the world, and we are making great progress
in the war on terrorism both at home and abroad."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the clearest indication that a Gore 2004 campaign would
look and sound very different from the 2000 incarnation came in his
discussion of health care. In 2000, Gore charged that rival Bradley's
health-care plan would disrupt the system through excessive change.
Gore argued for covering more of the uninsured by expanding programs
and tax credits.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he said, such incremental changes are inadequate. "The system
as a whole has reached a point of no return," Gore said. "It is
collapsing. It is beyond saving in its current design."</TE>
<TE>   By early next year, he said, he will offer a detailed plan for a
single-payer health-care system. Under such plans, a single entity --
presumably the federal government -- would fund all health care in
America.</TE>
<TE>   Gore did not indicate how he would pay for such a plan. But he
said three principles would guide it: The actual health care should
be privately run, it should offer Americans choices and it should
reduce spending on bureaucracy and paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   Gore's embrace of the single-payer idea points to a final telling
shift from 2000. In that race, he often accused Bradley of proposing
ideas that were unrealistic while power was so narrowly divided
between Republicans and Democrats in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Gore said, he might take a page from Bradley and challenge
the accepted parameters of the possible. Among the conclusions he
reached after 2000 is that he is less effective at crafting
compromises than trying to "present a bold vision" of where the
country should go.</TE>
<TE>   And that could make for a candidacy in which Gore presents himself
as a leader liberated by defeat to advance big ideas that look risky
to his rivals.</TE>

<HD>Extended Jobless Aid Threatened</HD>
<DH>Deadlock in Congress means 1 million people could face
cutoff three days after Christmas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In one of their first outings on a major economic issue since
sweeping this month's midterm elections, the Bush White House and
congressional Republicans managed a deadlock that -- unless broken --
will result in nearly 1 million jobless Americans losing their
unemployment benefits starting just three days after Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   A stalemate between the House and Senate and an apparent decision
by the White House to remain above the fray spells a Dec. 28 end to
the federal government's "extended benefits" program, which helps
jobless workers who have run through their six months of regular
unemployment checks with up to 13 weeks of extra payments.</LD>
<LD>   Even under a compromise being advanced -- apparently
unsuccessfully -- by Senate Democrats on Wednesday, the extended
benefits would run out Feb. 1, making them far less generous than
Washington was in the previous two recessions.</LD>
<TE>   For President Bush, who spent much of the fall touting the
administration's concern about joblessness and the weak economy, the
political repercussions of ending the benefits could be substantial.
Even some senior Republicans acknowledged the program's demise would
make it harder for the president to sell a new round of tax cuts --
especially business tax cuts -- to spur growth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unconscionable for us to leave town without fixing
unemployment compensation," said Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.). "The
political symbolism of it is just horrendous."</TE>
<TE>   The drive for a last-minute compromise apparently foundered late
Wednesday on the objections of House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield).</TE>
<TE>   Congressional staffers of both parties said Thomas refused to
accept any expansion of benefits beyond the narrow provisions of a
bill he authored, and rejected Senate appeals to separate the jobless
benefits issue from unrelated Medicare provisions included in the
House-passed measure.</TE>
<TE>   The Medicare provisions raised the ire of fellow Republican Sen.
Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who is about to become chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee and believes the panel has authority over
the huge federal health insurance program for the elderly. He was
miffed that Thomas did not consult him before pushing the changes.</TE>
<TE>   An aide to Thomas said the California Republican would not
comment.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials deplored the breakdown of compromise talks,
but asserted that there was nothing that the president, who is in
Europe for a NATO summit, could have done.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed," said administration economic spokeswoman
Claire Buchan. "We'd urged the House and Senate to resolve their
differences so they could send the president legislation he could
sign."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats took to the Senate floor to protest the breakdown in
compromise talks and the looming end of the benefits program.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to say I think it's a story right out of Charles Dickens,"
said Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the Senate's outgoing majority
leader. "Ebenezer Scrooge had a last-minute conversion. I would hope
that our Republican colleagues in the House would do so too."</TE>
<TE>   The demise of extended benefits will come with long-term
unemployment at a decade high, one in every five jobless workers now
out for six months or more and the number of people dependent on the
program rising sharply.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Labor Department figures for the end of October show
798,000 people -- including 113,000 Californians -- collecting
extended benefits. But estimates by the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a generally liberal Washington think tank, show that
number will climb to 825,000 by the end of December.</TE>
<TE>   The center estimates that an additional 90,000 people a week -- or
a total of 1.2 million -- will exhaust their regular, state-provided
jobless benefits in the first three months of the new year and will
be unable to get additional federal aid.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Gov. Gray Davis said this week, more than 300,000
state residents would run out of regular benefits in the first three
months of next year.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers of both parties warned that the Dec. 28 end of extended
benefits will prove particularly painful because the current
legislation provides for no phaseout. As a result, jobless workers
who are now collecting under the program and believe they have three
months of coverage ahead of them will suddenly find themselves
without a check.</TE>
<TE>   The cutoff of benefits that seems likely could spell trouble for a
politician at any time, but especially during the holiday season. And
it would seem to pose a particular risk for Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The president's father, former President Bush, is widely seen as
having clinched his reputation as insensitive to the concerns of
ordinary Americans by effectively vetoing benefit extensions twice
during the early 1990s recession.</TE>
<TE>   When he realized the political damage he had done at the start of
the 1992 election, the elder Bush quickly reversed himself, pushing
through three benefit extensions in quick succession and establishing
a presidential commission to overhaul the unemployment compensation
system. But the efforts were to no avail; the elder Bush lost his
reelection bid to Democrat Bill Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   The current president has gone out of his way to avoid the
political mistakes of his father, most recently by devoting part of
virtually every speech during the fall congressional campaigns to the
issues of jobs and the jobless.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said that in not entering the fray over extended
benefits, Bush may be counting on the fact that economic issues
played only a minor role in the campaign. They say he may also
believe that an emphasis on creating new jobs, rather than taking
care of those who lost old ones, will have more political appeal in
the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   But the deadlock over extended benefits revealed the kind of
fissures between members of his own party that could eventually turn
Republican control over both the White House and Congress from an
asset to a liability. And the impending cutoff of benefits risks
putting Bush's expected call for new tax cuts, especially for
business, in a most unflattering light.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he would explain the need for new tax cuts to a jobless
worker who lost extended benefits, Specter said, "I'm going to say to
him: 'We did you wrong.' "</TE>

<HD>Senate Ends Its Term With 72 Bush Judicial Nominees
Affirmed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate quit for the year Wednesday having confirmed 72 new judges
appointed by President Bush, the best one-year record since 1994 for
White House judicial nominees.</LD>
<LD>   However, the president's advisors were disappointed because nearly
half of Bush's selections to the U.S. appeals courts were blocked by
the Democratic-controlled Senate.</LD>
<LD>   "This is very troubling and unprecedented," said Viet Dinh, an
assistant attorney general who heads the office that screens
nominations. "All we wanted was an up-or-down vote on them."</LD>
<TE>   But the Democrats said the late rush of Senate confirmations shows
that the president's nominees fared reasonably well.</TE>
<TE>   "The vitriolic rhetoric [aside], ... the reality is that we have
approved far more judicial nominees for this president than past
Senates did for other presidents," said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy
(D-Vt.), the outgoing chairman of the Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The year's fierce ideological clash over judges ended in a battle
over statistics.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Bush had 100 judges confirmed in the two years of the
107th Congress. Of these, 83 will serve as trial judges on federal
district courts, while 17 will join the regional U.S. Circuit Courts
of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy contrasted that record with the six previous years, when
Democrat Bill Clinton was president and the Republicans controlled
the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton won confirmation of 73 judges in the 104th Congress of
1995-96; 98 judges in the 105th Congress of 1997-98; and 72 judges in
the 106th Congress of 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy also said there were 110 vacancies on the federal courts
when the Democrats took control of the Senate in July 2001 and only
60 today, far fewer than most of the years Clinton was in the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   But Senate Republicans and the president's aides said these
comparisons are misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Most new presidents win easy confirmation of nearly all their
first nominees to the federal bench. And no president has had as many
of his appeals court nominees blocked, they said.</TE>
<TE>   In his first two years in office, Clinton had a Democratic
majority in the Senate and won confirmation of 126 judges, including
19 of 22 nominees to the appellate courts.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties focus more attention on the appeals courts because
those judges can set the law for their regions.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, Bush announced his first 11 appellate court nominees.
Nine were conservatives with solid credentials; two were black
Democrats who were first nominated by Clinton. Soon after, Bush
nominated Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl to the U.S.
9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy and the Democrats moved quickly to confirm the two
Democrats, but then confirmed only three of the remaining nominees.
Most of Bush's other appeals court nominees, including Kuhl, have had
neither a hearing nor a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Bush made 130 judicial nominations in his first two years.
Seventy-six percent won confirmation, administration lawyers said,
well below the 90% rates for past presidents. And only 53% of Bush's
appeals court nominees were confirmed, they said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bush is expected to renominate all of the prospective
judges early next year. They will come before a Judiciary Committee
with a GOP majority.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative activists said the liberal attacks on Bush's nominees
backfired on the Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen the process get more and more acrimonious. They
injected the ideological litmus test and labeled people as
extremists," said John Nowacki, director of legal policy at the Free
Congress Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington. "But
this got conservatives riled up. In reality, most people are
comfortable with the kind of nominees [Bush] was putting forward."</TE>
<TE>   The senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee agreed that the
midterm elections were, in part, a referendum on the partisan battle
over judges.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I see it, the president took three issues to the
American people: his Iraq policy, homeland security and his judicial
nominees," Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said Tuesday on the Senate
floor. "The election showed that Americans trust this president,
including his selection of judicial nominees."</TE>
<TE>   Hatch promised speedier action next year. "The voters have
rejected obstruction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Liberal activists conceded that they will have a hard time
stopping even the most conservative of Bush's nominees.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a steamroller effect from the election," said Kate
Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League. "There will a rush to move the courts further to the
right. And so far it doesn't seem like most Americans are awake to
the loss of freedoms on the horizon."</TE>

<HD>Sniper Suspect's Mom Ordered Deported</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The mother of teenage sniper suspect Lee Boyd Malvo has been ordered
deported to Jamaica, an Immigration and Naturalization Service
spokesman said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   An immigration judge signed the order Tuesday after Una James, 38,
dropped battered-spouse claims that were part of a petition she made
to seek special protection in the United States, INS spokesman
Garrison Courtney said.</LD>
<LD>   However, Courtney said a federal judge could block the deportation
if another agency -- namely, the Justice Department -- wanted to keep
her in the country. James is considered a probable witness in the
sniper shootings.</LD>
<TE>   John Hartingh, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Seattle, said he had heard of no such plans. James' lawyers would not
comment, citing confidentiality rules.</TE>
<TE>   The INS decision was first reported by the Seattle Times.</TE>
<TE>   Malvo, 17, and John Allen Muhammad, 41, are suspected in the
shootings of 18 people in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C.,
Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana. Their arrest at a rest stop in
Maryland last month ended a three-week shooting rampage in the
Washington area that left 10 people dead.</TE>
<TE>   Both men are charged with capital murder.</TE>
<TE>   James and Malvo moved from Jamaica to Antigua in 1998.
Investigators believe it was there that Malvo met Muhammad, who had
taken three of his children to live with him on Antigua after losing
a custody battle with his second wife in Tacoma, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   James initially told Border Patrol and immigration agents she and
Malvo were smuggled into the United States aboard a cargo ship.</TE>
<TE>   Reports since the arrest of Malvo and Muhammad, however, indicate
she bought false identification papers from Muhammad and entered the
country in late 2000 while her son remained in Antigua with Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   Malvo came to the United States two months later, bearing a
passport that identified him as Muhammad's son, according to Antiguan
officials.</TE>
<TE>   He joined his mother in Fort Myers, Fla., but ran away in October
2001 to join Muhammad in Bellingham, Wash., where they lived at a
homeless shelter as father and son.</TE>
<TE>   In December, James asked Bellingham police to help her get her son
back.</TE>
<TE>   During the investigation, police said, Malvo's comments indicated
that both he and his mother were in the country illegally and
officers summoned the Border Patrol, which arrested the mother and
son and then released them on $1,500 bail.</TE>

<HD>Researchers Hope to Create New Form of Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Scientists will announce today that they will try to create a new
form of life in a laboratory dish, the Washington Post reported.</LD>
<LD>   Gene scientist J. Craig Venter and Hamilton Smith, a Nobel
laureate, will announce their hopes of creating a single-cell,
partially manufactured organism with the minimum number of genes
necessary to sustain life.</LD>
<LD>   If the plan works, the microscopic cell will begin feeding and
dividing to create a population of cells unlike any known to exist,
the Post reported on its Web site.</LD>
<TE>   The cell will be hobbled to render it incapable of infecting
people -- a safety step. It also will be confined and designed to die
if it does escape into the environment, the paper said.</TE>
<TE>   The project could lay the scientific groundwork for a new
generation of biological weapons. But Venter and Smith said the
project could also help in enhancing the nation's ability to detect
and counter existing biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The project is funded with a three-year, $3-million grant from the
Energy Department.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is to figure out and model in a computer all aspects of
the biology of one organism.</TE>
<TE>   "We are wondering if we can come up with a molecular definition of
life," Venter told the Post. "The goal is to fundamentally understand
the components of the most basic living cell."</TE>
<TE>   The plan will begin with Mycoplasma genitalium, a minuscule
organism that lives in the genital tracts of people and may cause or
contribute to an inflammation of the urethra. All genetic material
will be removed from the organism. Scientists will synthesize a
string of genetic material, resembling a naturally occurring
chromosome, that they hope will contain the minimum number of M.
genitalium genes needed to sustain life.</TE>
<TE>   The artificial chromosome will then be inserted in the cell, and
will be tested for its ability to survive and reproduce.</TE>
<TE>   Venter and Smith founded Celera Genomics Corp., the Rockville,
Md.-based company where researchers tied government scientists in the
race to decipher the human genome two years ago.</TE>

<HD>Experts: Alaska Fault Shift Rivals '06 Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 7.9 magnitude earthquake in Alaska this month was triggered by one
of the largest fault ruptures in at least 150 years, rivaling the one
that caused the great 1906 San Francisco quake, geologists said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Nov. 3 quake struck a remote and sparsely populated area near
Denali National Park and caused only minor injuries, although it
damaged three major highways and forced officials to temporarily shut
down the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.</LD>
<LD>   A team of geologists who spent a week studying the temblor
determined that it was largely caused by a rupture of a 130-mile
section of the Denali fault, with horizontal shifts of up to nearly
26 feet.</LD>
<TE>   Kerry Sieh, a geology professor at Caltech in Pasadena, said the
rupture ranks in size alongside those that caused two great
earthquakes along California's San Andreas fault -- the 1906 San
Francisco quake and another major temblor in 1857.</TE>
<TE>   Sieh said Denali and San Andreas are both "strike-slip" faults,
meaning that blocks on either side of the fracture move sideways
relative to one another. Over millions of years, he said, the shifts
have moved southern Alaska miles westward relative to the rest of the
state.</TE>
<TE>   He said the shifts have produced a set of large, aligned valleys
through the middle of the snowy Alaska range, from the Canadian
border in the east to Mt. McKinley in the west.</TE>
<TE>   Along much of its length, Sieh said, the Denali fault crosses
glaciers; during this month's quake, it broke up through the
glaciers, offsetting large crevasses and rocky ridges within the ice.</TE>
<TE>   The quake also produced thousands of avalanches and rock falls.</TE>
<TE>   Sieh said that in some places, enormous blocks of rock and ice
fell onto glaciers and valley floors, skidding about six-tenths of a
mile or more over ice, streams and tundra.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists were surprised to discover that the fault rupture
moved only east from the epicenter and left the western half of the
great fault unbroken, Sieh said, prompting them to speculate that the
quake could have been the first in a series of large events that will
eventually include breaks farther west toward Mt. McKinley and Denali
park.</TE>

<LD>NEW YORK -- Rabbi Fred J. Neulander, a charismatic religious leader
who helped establish one of New Jersey's largest Reform
congregations, was convicted Wednesday of hiring two hit men to
murder his wife.</LD>
<LD>   The four-week retrial brought closure to the long-running case,
which attracted national attention and had resulted in a hung jury
last year. Neulander, 61, is believed to be the first U.S. rabbi
convicted of a capital offense, and he could face the death penalty.
His verdict was seen as a bellwether of how severely juries might be
willing to punish religious leaders for such crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Neulander showed no emotion as the verdicts were read in a
Monmouth County courtroom. Yet his wife's relatives, who had packed
the small chamber each day, wept openly at first and then hugged each
other emotionally as a jury found the rabbi guilty of murder and
conspiracy charges in the Nov. 1, 1994, slaying of Carol Neulander.</LD>
<TE>   "We are very pleased by the verdicts returned this afternoon,"
said Camden County Prosecutor James P. Lynch, who retried the case in
northern New Jersey after Superior Court Judge Linda G. Baxter
ordered it moved to ensure a fair jury pool for the second trial.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch declined to comment further, however, noting that the "very
critical" penalty phase of Neulander's trial will begin today. He has
indicated that prosecutors will vigorously pursue the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Riley, Neulander's attorney, said, "We're very
disappointed, obviously," with the outcome, and he added that
Neulander -- who did not testify -- will "very definitely" speak on
his own behalf today as the jury ponders the appropriate sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Riley added that he would argue against the death penalty, largely
because of Neulander's age, and the fact that he has no prior record.</TE>
<TE>   The story of Carol Neulander's death was shocking enough when it
first emerged: Her bludgeoned body was found in the living room of
the affluent Cherry Hills, N.J., home that she had shared with her
husband of 28 years. In 1973, they had founded Congregation M'kor
Shalom, a thriving synagogue that quickly grew to more than 1,000
congregants.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Neulander, 52, was a popular leader of the community who had
also helped establish a successful bakery. At first, few suspected
that Rabbi Neulander had anything to do with the crime. But sordid
details of his private life began leaking out that stunned friends
and congregants.</TE>
<TE>   Neulander, it turned out, had been carrying on affairs with
several members of the synagogue, including Elaine Soncini, a
Philadelphia radio celebrity. Investigators alleged that she had
threatened to break off their relationship unless Neulander left his
wife, and that the rabbi had her killed to carry on the secret
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   He was forced to resign his post when members of M'kor Shalom
learned of his trysts, some of which took place in his synagogue
office. But linking him to his wife's death proved more difficult.
Although he was charged with her murder in 1998, police were stumped
because there was no hard evidence linking him to the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The rabbi insisted he was innocent, but the case quickly came
together in May 2000, when Len Jenoff -- who said he had been hired
as the rabbi's private investigator -- told Philadelphia Inquirer
reporter Nancy Phillips that he and another man, Paul Daniels, had
been promised $30,000 by Neulander if they would kill his wife.</TE>
<TE>   In a confession at a New Jersey roadside diner, Jenoff told
investigators that he and Daniels had gone to Carol Neulander's home
on a Thursday night when she was alone and had beaten her to death
with a lead pipe. They stole her purse to make it look as if she had
been killed during a routine robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Jenoff's dramatic confession gave prosecutors the evidence they
had been looking for, but he too, had a dark past. A recovering
alcoholic, Jenoff was battered by defense attorneys in the two trials
for being a habitual liar who regularly dreamed up stories about
himself, including accounts that he was a member of the Israeli
secret service and the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   During last year's trial, Neulander insisted that Jenoff had acted
on his own. But he conceded that "I betrayed Carol, I betrayed my
family, I betrayed the community, I betrayed the synagogue."</TE>
<TE>   Jenoff and Daniels pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter as
part of a plea-bargain with prosecutors, and they could face 15 to 30
years in prison. They could, however, be paroled earlier, based on
their cooperation with authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Although jurors refused to discuss Wednesday's verdict,
prosecutors produced several witnesses who may have had a great
effect on the proceedings, which were televised on the Court TV cable
channel. Chief among them was Matthew Neulander, the couple's
second-oldest child, who could barely conceal his contempt for his
father on the witness stand.</TE>
<TE>   He expressed disgust at his father's cold, detached behavior in
the traumatic minutes after his wife's battered body was discovered
by police.</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony, jurors listened intently as Rebecca Neulander,
the couple's only daughter, described a crucial link between Jenoff
and her father. Jenoff had testified that he planned to kill Carol
Neulander a week or so before Nov. 1, 1994, and that he visited her
house, but then lost his nerve. He returned to commit the crime on
the second visit, Jenoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, Rebecca Neulander recalled that she had been
talking with her mother on a cell phone during each of Jenoff's
visits. She testified that Carol Neulander told her both times that
the rabbi had said a man would be coming to their house to deliver a
package.</TE>
<TE>   The first time, Rebecca Neulander testified that she was
suspicious about the visit and waited for the unknown visitor to
leave. But her mother assured her that everything was all right
during the man's second visit, and she hung up the phone -- minutes
before Carol Neulander was killed.</TE>

<HD>Endeavour Cleared for Launch</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>After a week of grueling, nonstop work, NASA cleared space shuttle
Endeavour for a Friday liftoff and declared the ship's damaged robot
arm safe to fly.</LD>
<LD>   The decision came late Wednesday, less than 24 hours after the
countdown clocks began ticking.</LD>
<LD>   Mission Control quickly relayed the good news to the three
residents of the international space station. They have been on board
since June, and Endeavour is their ride home.</LD>
<TE>   Shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore said no further testing is
required for Endeavour's robot arm, which is used during space
station construction. He also expressed confidence that a leaking
oxygen line aboard Endeavour is fixed.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a tremendous effort over the last week to get to this
point," Dittemore said.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour's 50-foot robot arm was bruised Nov. 12 when workers
knocked a platform into it. They were in the payload bay to find and
repair an oxygen leak that forced NASA to call off a launch attempt
the day before.</TE>
<TE>   The platform tore through the thermal blanket covering the arm and
an outer honeycomb layer, and left a 2-inch-square bruise on the
actual carbon composite structure. NASA conducted ultrasound tests on
the area and asked the Canadian company that built the arm to
re-create the damage on an arm replica and gauge its strength.</TE>

<HD>Man, 18, Accused of Extortion in Case of Missing Utah Girl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A grand jury indicted an 18-year-old man Wednesday for allegedly
trying to extort $3 million by falsely claiming to be the kidnapper
of Elizabeth A. Smart.</LD>
<LD>   Walter Kenneth Holloway, of Charleston, S.C., allegedly sent more
than three dozen e-mails claiming he was the kidnapper and demanding
ransom.</LD>
<LD>   Smart, 14, disappeared from her bedroom June 5. The case remains
unsolved.</LD>
<TE>   Holloway reportedly confessed that he kept up a regular
correspondence with Salt Lake City police and the Smart family,
threatening to hurt the girl and demanding ransom from her father.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested this month. The charge of interstate extortion
carries a 20-year prison term and that of sending threatening
communications carries a five-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Lionel Lofton, who represented Holloway at a hearing in
South Carolina, had said Holloway lives with his family, has a job
cleaning a day-care center and has been schooled at home.</TE>
<TE>   With the indictment in place, federal prosecutors say they will
have the case moved to Utah.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI found Holloway, who was using the screen name
"Elizabethsmartkidnapper," by serving his Internet service provider
with a subpoena for account information.</TE>

<HD>Moussaoui May Have Had a Lesser Role</HD>
<DH>The defendant was only a 9/11 backup, captured Al Qaeda
operative claims. If so, that could deter U.S. argument for executing
him, some say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An imprisoned Al Qaeda operative's reported description of Zacarias
Moussaoui as a backup figure could weaken the government's argument
for executing the man accused as a Sept. 11 conspirator, experts said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials said Tuesday that an Al Qaeda operative, Ramzi
Binalshibh, told interrogators that Moussaoui met with the suspected
mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon in
late 2000 or early 2001 in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Binalshibh, a former aide to top Al Qaeda operative Khalid Shaikh
Mohammed, said Mohammed provided Moussaoui with contacts in the U.S.
-- but they were not confident that Moussaoui could keep a secret,
said officials speaking on the condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui, acting as his own lawyer, and a defense team appointed
by the judge have asked that Binalshibh be a defense witness. The
request is complicated in Moussaoui's case because the government may
not want such enemy combatants as Binalshibh to reveal sensitive
information in courtrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said Binalshibh's reported statements posed a threat
to the prosecution's stated goal of executing Moussaoui if he is
convicted. The experts were less certain about the effect on the
guilt or innocence phase without more details about possible
Moussaoui knowledge of the Sept. 11 plot. Moussaoui has admitted his
loyalty to Al Qaeda but has denied a role in the hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   David Bruck, a Columbia, S.C., lawyer who heads a death penalty
project for federal public defenders, said the federal death penalty
law requires the government to prove a defendant's intention to kill
-- and that victims died as a result of his actions.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, who was arrested at a Minneapolis-area flight school in
August 2001, was in custody on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "The statute was intended to cover a person who hires a hit man,"
Bruck said. "Being a stumblebum on the fringes, who was too
unreliable to be trusted and then abandoned by plotters, is not
committing an act that leads to anybody's death."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights
in Atlanta, said the Supreme Court has made it clear that major
participation in taking a life is necessary for imposition of the
death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1982 Florida case, the court ruled that the role of a getaway
car's driver was tangential to the deaths of a couple murdered by
accomplices during a robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, in Tison vs. Arizona, the court upheld the death
penalty for two brothers who brought weapons into an Arizona prison
to help their father escape.</TE>
<TE>   Several days later, the brothers and the father kidnapped a family
and drove the victims into the desert, where the father killed the
hostages after the sons had walked away.</TE>
<TE>   The court said the Tison brothers' degree of participation was
major, unlike the driver in the Florida case.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Precht, an assistant dean at the University of Michigan's
law school, and the lawyer for a defendant in the first World Trade
Center bombing case, said it is difficult to determine whether
Binalshibh's evidence could be exculpatory -- tending to clear
Moussaoui of guilt.</TE>
<TE>   "If he was kept in the dark and was a backup person and the plan
was to tell him to kind of cool his heels for the next six months,
and call him if they need him, that would be exculpatory because
they're keeping him in the dark about the conspiracy," Precht said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they briefed Moussaoui on the general aims, made sure he's
trained and ready to go on a moment's notice, that's not exculpatory
evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh was an associate of Mohammed, Moussaoui, chief hijacker
Mohamed Atta and others in the Hamburg, Germany-based cell that led
the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   He was captured by U.S. and Pakistani authorities during a raid in
Karachi in Septem- ber and has since been held in U.S. custody at a
secret location.</TE>
<TE>   The Moussaoui-Mohammed contacts were first reported Wednesday by
the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's trial is scheduled for June.</TE>

<HD>Marvin Davis Said to Offer $15 Billion for Vivendi
Universal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Bates and Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billionaire Marvin Davis and a group of investors have approached
Vivendi Universal SA with a proposal to buy its entertainment assets,
including Universal Studios and its theme parks, sources close to the
proposal said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   While some Vivendi insiders said the $15-billion offer was too low
to be taken seriously, others said that, depending on how it was
structured, it could provide the answer to many of Vivendi's
financial woes -- including nearly $19 billion in media debt.</LD>
<LD>   One major hurdle is expected to be resistance from Barry Diller,
co-CEO of Vivendi's entertainment unit. Diller has expressed coolness
toward Davis' overtures, sources say.</LD>
<TE>   Skeptics noted that Vivendi Universal CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou has
not been seeking buyers for the Universal assets, unlike other parts
of the French media empire that are being auctioned off to pare the
company's debt load. Fourtou already has sold Vivendi's Internet
business, Italian pay TV operation and has announced a deal to sell
U.S. book publisher Houghton Mifflin.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they're feeling any pressure to sell the studio,"
one executive said.</TE>
<TE>   Any deal is likely to include Vivendi as a partner, with Vivendi
retaining a piece, sources said. Sources close to Davis say he is
confident he can buy the assets at a relatively good price, cut
costs, stabilize management and go public in about three years.</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon Ausman, a former Davis employee, was unaware of the offer
but said it did not surprise him. "Marvin is a very capable
entrepreneur and he knows an opportunity when he sees it."</TE>
<TE>   The deal is being put together by a group called Universal
Partners, a consortium that includes Davis and other financiers.
Deutsche Bank has offered to help finance the deal and others are
showing interest, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   This month, three Davis advisors met with three Vivendi advisors.
Davis could not attend. Fourtou did not attend either, but did meet
Deutsche Bank. Davis and Fourtou have been talking regularly by
phone, and by correspondence.</TE>
<TE>   The fledgling proposal marked the latest foray into the limelight
for Davis, who has parlayed a long string of savvy oil and real
estate deals in Denver into a glamorous Hollywood lifestyle that once
included owning the 20th Century Fox studio. Davis and his partners
bought the studio for $720 million in 1981, then selling the
money-losing operation for a $350-million profit to Rupert Murdoch
four years later.</TE>
<TE>   At a 1986 dinner, Davis said of the entertainment business: "I
love this stuff, the people and the glamour. This isn't just a
business. It's a ... lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has been among the richest individuals in L.A., with a net
worth recently estimated by Forbes at $4.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has been known almost as much for the assets he came close
to buying, but never did, as he has for the deals he consummated.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has a reputation as a savvy investor, but one who passes
when at a too-high price.</TE>

<HD>Global Warming to Sap the West's Water Needs, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global warming will have a devastating effect on the availability of
water in the Western United States, according to a new study, which
was billed as the rosiest of a series of climate forecasts despite
its dismal outlook.</LD>
<LD>   Even as a best-case scenario, it forecasts supplies falling far
short of future demands for water by cities, farms and wildlife.</LD>
<LD>   "You'd like there to be some good news in there somewhere, but
unfortunately there is not," said Tim Barnett, a research marine
physicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</LD>
<TE>   Overall precipitation levels are likely to remain constant, but
warmer temperatures mean what would have fallen as snow will instead
come down as rain.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the snowpack acts as a natural reservoir, storing water
through the winter only to melt and release it during the spring and
summer when demand spikes. If that precipitation falls as winter
rain, however, it will fill rivers and streams at a time of year when
demand is low.</TE>
<TE>   The new study involved more than two dozen scientists and
engineers, from institutions including Scripps, the University of
Washington, the Energy Department and the U.S. Geological Survey, who
undertook it as a test of a national climate forecasting effort. The
results are expected to appear in an issue of the journal Climatic
Change.</TE>
<TE>   To create the forecasts, scientists began two years ago with
current observations of the state of the world's oceans -- those vast
reservoirs of heat that drive climate -- and worked to translate that
into real effects on precipitation and temperature in the Columbia,
Sacramento and Colorado river basins. Although it is not the first
study of its kind, it is the most rigorous, Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the findings of what is forecast to occur in the next 25 to
50 years:</TE>
<TE>   * Reservoir levels along the Colorado River will drop by more than
a third and releases by 17%. The lower levels and flows will cut
hydropower generation by as much as 40%.</TE>
<TE>   * The Sacramento River will see reduced reliability in the volumes
of water available for irrigation, cities and hydropower. With less
fresh water, the Sacramento Delta will increase in salinity,
disrupting the ecosystem.</TE>
<TE>   * On the Columbia River system, there will be water in the summer
and fall to generate electricity, or in the spring and summer for
salmon runs -- but not both.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is you basically can't resolve that trade-off," said
Dennis Lettenmaier, a professor of civil and environmental
engineering at the University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Other scenarios that gauge the effect of even moderate
global-scale warming on the West suggest the effects could be two to
three times worse -- or of the same magnitude but occurring sooner --
than the newer estimates, Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   The continued growth in the population of the West will exacerbate
the problem. Indeed, that alone makes for a crisis, said Bill
Patzert, a NASA research oceanographer who was not connected with the
new research.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem in the West is not climate change, it's too many ...
people using too much water," Patzert said. "If nothing happens,
we're in trouble. If something happens, it's worse."</TE>
<TE>   In California, the 2003 update to the state water plan will
include for the first time consideration of the impact of climate
change.</TE>
<TE>   "Climate change just adds to the complexity [of] the already
complex job of responding to changes in demand," said Doug Osugi, an
engineer in the water planning branch of the California Department of
Water Resources.</TE>
<TE>   One possible outcome is that the West would have to expand its
network of dams, adding storage capacity to catch runoff, Barnett and
others said.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, our infrastructure was designed with the current
climate in mind, not a different one, so that creates problems," said
Pierre Stephens, lead water supply forecaster for the California
Department of Water Resources.</TE>

<HD>Design Set for Larger No. 7 Tower</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A 750-foot glass-and-steel office tower -- with better fireproofing
and wider stairs for quick evacuation -- will be built on the site of
one of the smaller buildings to collapse last year at the World Trade
Center complex.</LD>
<LD>   The plans, unveiled Wednesday, represent the first major
rebuilding project at the site of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The 52-story building at 7 World Trade Center -- across the street
from the main trade center site -- will be sleeker and five stories
taller than its predecessor, which collapsed in a raging fire several
hours after the twin 110-story towers fell.</LD>
<TE>   "The fact that this building is going up now and going up here,
right on the site of the old No. 7, says that we will not be
intimidated by the terrorists," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Architects are still working on designs for the larger trade
center site. Although those plans will not be made final until next
year, developer Larry Silverstein and his architect, David Childs of
Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill, said their design for 7 World Trade Center
would serve as a model.</TE>
<TE>   The main site is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey; Silverstein is the leaseholder.</TE>
<TE>   The new building, scheduled to open in late 2005, has been
designed with stairs 20% wider than required by city code, sturdier
fireproofing than required, and an internal antenna system for better
communication by firefighters and police. Officials complained of
radio trouble during rescue operations last year.</TE>
<TE>   The first 10 stories will be occupied by a Con Edison power
company substation; other tenants have not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   The original building housed a Con Ed substation, the mayor's
Office of Emergency Management and other government and financial
offices. It had been evacuated before it fell, and no one was killed
there.</TE>
<TE>   Silverstein said that $800 million in insurance proceeds will
cover most of the new building.</TE>

<HD>Asteroid Danger to Earth Downgraded</HD>
<DH>Such objects hit far less frequently than scientists had
thought, satellite data show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Piller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An analysis of once-secret satellite data indicates that asteroids
capable of causing catastrophic damage strike the Earth only about
once every 1,000 years -- far less frequently than previously
thought.</LD>
<LD>   Using eight years of data collected for national security purposes
by the departments of Defense and Energy, researchers disputed
long-held assumptions that asteroids about 50 meters in diameter
(about 55 yards across) enter the atmosphere once every 200 to 300
years.</LD>
<LD>   The last 50-meter asteroid to hit Earth exploded above Tunguska
River Valley in Siberia in 1908, flattening 700 square miles of
remote forest land. Scientists blame a far larger asteroid, that
struck the Yucatan Peninsula 65 million years ago, for profound
climatic changes that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs.</LD>
<TE>   Data from the new study suggest that if a Tunguska-sized rock hits
every 1,000 years, a city is likely to be destroyed no more than
every 30,000 years given that most of the Earth is ocean and much of
the land mass is sparsely populated, said David Morrison, a space
scientist at the NASA Ames Research Center.</TE>
<TE>   The study, published in today's issue of the journal Nature,
examined 300 small asteroids that exploded in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, this gives us an accurate estimate for the
rate of impact of bodies hitting the Earth in the 1-to-10-meter-size
range," said Peter Brown, an astronomer from the University of
Western Ontario, and lead author of the paper.</TE>
<TE>   By comparing that information with observations of larger space
rocks viewed using ground-based telescopes, the researchers
discovered a consistent way to calculate the rate of Earth collisions
for asteroids of all sizes.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, most information on "near-Earth" asteroids and
comets has been gathered by telescopes that can reliably find only
objects 1 kilometer or larger in diameter.</TE>
<TE>   A direct hit by such a gigantic rock would cause drastic
environmental damage, if not global apocalypse.</TE>
<TE>   About 650 of an estimated 1,000 such large objects have been
tracked. None will hit the Earth in the foreseeable future, Morrison
said. Most of the rest should be cataloged by 2008.</TE>
<TE>   But more numerous medium-sized objects -- such as the Tunguska
asteroid -- are usually too small to be detected using telescopes.
The frequency of their collisions with Earth had previously been
extrapolated from observations of larger objects.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers improved on earlier estimates by charting
collisions of relatively common asteroids that are too small to be
seen using a telescope. This was accomplished by measuring the bright
flash caused by their explosions in the atmosphere. The asteroid
hunters extrapolated the data to fill in the gap between very large
near-Earth asteroids and very small ones, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, knowing that catastrophic hits are rare provides cold
comfort, because scientists cannot predict when or where a specific
rock will land.</TE>
<TE>   "When you cross a busy street, you don't care what the statistics
are of a pedestrian being hit. You want to know if a car is headed
for you," said Morrison.</TE>
<TE>   But the study may help to provide a different kind of reassurance,
said Clarke R. Chapman, a space expert at the Southwest Research
Institute in Boulder, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   "Unusual, bright exploding phenomena in the skies could be
misinterpreted as a nuclear attack," he said, particularly during
periods of tension between nuclear powers -- such as last summer's
conflict between Pakistan and India. "So understanding how often they
happen and what they are about could help calm nerves."</TE>

<HD>Vaccine May Be the Key in Cervical Cancer Fight</HD>
<DH>Wide use could come in five years and lead to an 85%
decline in new cases worldwide. Like polio, infection might fade
away, scientist says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas H. Maugh II</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. researchers have successfully tested a vaccine against human
papilloma virus, a feat many consider the first step toward the
eventual prevention of most cases of cervical cancer, which is caused
by the virus.</LD>
<LD>   Widespread use of the vaccine, which could occur in as little as
five years, could eventually result in an 85% reduction in the
worldwide number of 450,000 new cervical  cancer cases and 250,000
deaths each year.</LD>
<LD>   Such an effective vaccine "would have profound effects," said Dr.
Christopher P. Crum of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who
added that papilloma infections could eventually fade away, as have
polio, smallpox and diphtheria.</LD>
<TE>   Another team reports today that a vaccine against herpes simplex
virus 2, the primary cause of genital herpes, is 74% effective in
women who have never been exposed to a herpes virus. Genital herpes
afflicts one in five Americans over age 12.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first clinically relevant success we have had in the
entire field," said Charles Ebel of the American Social Health Assn.,
which has been leading anti-herpes campaigns. "Nothing has worked at
all until now."</TE>
<TE>   Some data suggest that herpes also contributes to cervical cancer,
so the development of a vaccine against it would provide a double
whammy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time that this type of therapeutic intervention
is available for a cancer that affects hundreds of thousands of women
worldwide," said Dr. Beth Carlin of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Both vaccines are now entering larger clinical trials. The herpes
vaccine also could be available for clinical use in as little as five
years.</TE>
<TE>   Since human papilloma viruses were discovered two decades ago,
researchers have identified 20, five of which are involved in
triggering cervical cancer. But one, HPV-16, is by far the most
common, infecting an estimated 20% of the U.S. population and causing
at least half of the cancer cases. The new vaccine specifically
targets HPV-16.</TE>
<TE>   The vaccine is made of virus-like particles, grown in yeast, that
have all of the surface proteins of the virus but none of its genetic
information. It is made by Merck Research Laboratories and
administered in three injections over six months. Merck paid for the
latest study.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, a team led by Laura A. Koutsky, an epidemiologist at
the University of Washington, tested 1,533 women ages 16 to 23. Half
received the vaccine and half a placebo. The women were studied for
an average of two years, and they will be followed for an additional
two.</TE>
<TE>   The team reports in today's issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine that 41 women in the placebo group developed HPV-16
infections during the course of the study, but that none of the women
receiving the vaccine did. Nine cases of HPV-16-related cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia -- a precursor of cervical cancer --
occurred among women who received the placebo, but none among those
who received the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   The group is now starting trials of a vaccine that targets not
only HPV-16, but also three other papilloma viruses. The four viruses
account for 70% of cervical cancers and 90% of genital warts.</TE>
<TE>   "The implications of having a vaccine are enormous," Koutsky said.
Screening for cervical cancers with Pap smears has reduced the yearly
number of deaths in the United States to about 4,100, but the tests
are too expensive for most developing countries. "A vaccine could
make a real impact in those countries," Koutsky said.</TE>
<TE>   It could have a different kind of effect in this country, Carlin
said. Many women with cervical cancer must undergo hysterectomies as
treatment, leaving them infertile. Preventing infections would
eliminate most of those cases, she said.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of positive Pap smears, furthermore, are associated
with an HPV infection rather than cervical cancer, and each positive
test requires expensive and time-consuming follow-up tests to rule
out disease, Crum said. A decrease in infections would eliminate as
many as 70% of the false-positives, alleviating the stress on the
women involved and potentially saving the health-care system billions
of dollars every year.</TE>
<TE>   At least two other HPV vaccines are now in clinical trials, and
researchers are looking at innovative ways to produce others.
Researchers at the University of Rochester in New York, for example,
are developing potatoes, tomatoes and bananas that contain the HPV
virus-like particles. Tests in animals have shown that these
particles produce immunity similar to that produced by conventional
vaccines. But they could have a major advantage in that they would be
cheaper to produce and less resistant to degradation in tropical
countries.</TE>
<TE>   The herpes vaccine, produced by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, is
targeted at herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2). A related virus, HSV-1,
primarily causes oral herpes, but it can produce the genital form as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Herpes viruses can cause painful itching and sores, but most
people who are infected show no symptoms, which is why it is spread
so easily. Recent evidence suggests that a co-infection of HPV and
HSV-2 doubles the risk of cervical cancer. Herpes infections are also
thought to accelerate the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus.
And babies who contract the herpes virus from their mothers are at a
high risk of death. From 2,500 to 3,000 such cases occur in the
United States each year.</TE>
<TE>   A team led by Dr. Lawrence Stanberry of the University of Texas
Medical Branch in Galveston enrolled 978 women and 1,736 men whose
partners had genital herpes. Half received the vaccine in three
injections and half a placebo.</TE>
<TE>   The team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that the
vaccine protected 74% of women who had never been exposed to either
HSV-2 or HSV-1. It was much less effective in women who had been
exposed to HSV-1, and for reasons that mystify the researchers, was
not effective at all in men.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers expect to make improvements in the efficacy of the
vaccine. But even if they do not, Ebel said, mathematical modeling
suggests that widespread use of a vaccine that is 74% effective only
in women could still produce a significant reduction of cases in both
men and women.</TE>
<TE>   The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said
Wednesday that it will begin enrolling 7,550 women this week in a
much larger trial. Enrollment will be restricted to women who have
not been exposed to either form of the virus.</TE>
<TE>   Because neither vaccine is effective on a person who has been
exposed to the virus, researchers say it may necessary to vaccinate
girls before they have any sexual experiences, probably around age 12
or 13. "It would eventually become part of our vaccine protocol,"
Carlin said.</TE>
