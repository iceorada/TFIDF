<HD>Casualties of the Class of '69</HD>
<DH>July, July, A Novel, Tim O'Brien, Houghton Mifflin: 322
pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Ciabattari</AU>
<BD>Jane Ciabattari is the author of the short-story
collection "Stealing the Fire" and is a contributing editor to Parade
magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For nearly 30 years, Tim O'Brien has been the bard of the baby
boomers, chronicling the nightmares and anxieties of the generation
that came of age during the 1960s. "I grew out of one war and into
another," he wrote in his harrowing 1973 memoir of the Vietnam War,
"If I Die in a Combat Zone." "Can a foot soldier teach anything
important about war, merely having been there?" he asked then. "I
think not. He can tell war stories."</LD>
<LD>   O'Brien's war stories are his legacy, not only the memoir but also
the National Book Award-winning novel "Going After Cacciato" (1978),
a hallucinatory novel about a soldier who walks away from the Vietnam
War and heads for Paris; and "The Things They Carried" (1990), which
contains some of the best stories ever written about war.</LD>
<LD>   O'Brien does not seem as sure-footed when his subject matter is
the complexities of life back home for men haunted by the war or the
battle of the sexes, in which the rules of engagement are as murky as
those in Vietnam, with sudden betrayals, subterranean flare-ups and
grenades lobbed from friendly corners. His sense of humanity does not
seem to extend to his female characters, who are rarely as fully
realized as his men.</LD>
<TE>   His new novel, "July, July," brings together members of the Class
of '69, who once dreamed of changing the world and are now slogging
through the minefields of middle age, for a college reunion in a
small town in Minnesota. "It was July 7, 2000, a humid Friday
evening. The war was over, passions were moot, and the band played a
slow, hollowed-out version of an old Buffalo Springfield tune. For
everyone, there was a sense of nostalgia made fluid by present
possibility."</TE>
<TE>   The Class of '69 is suffering from more than nostalgia. There are
its recent casualties (one classmate has been murdered, another has
drowned) and its walking wounded (a Vietnam vet who has lost a leg, a
breast cancer survivor, a heavy man with a failing triple bypass).
There are the divorced and lonely, the married and adulterous. The
class sexpot, whose menage is made up of two husbands and a younger
lover, is on the verge of another breakdown. The draft dodger who
fled to Canada still pines for the woman who was supposed to come
with him. The atmosphere is saturated with regret, guilt and
not-yet-satisfied urges. By the end of the weekend, with a little
help from alcohol and drugs, the secrets come out, and the
repercussions of life's choices hit with a vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   "July, July" is taut and compelling, particularly in the chapters
that tell individual stories, several of which have appeared in
Esquire and The New Yorker. The reunion scenes are not as well
fleshed out. And several of the female characters seem
one-dimensional, distinguished primarily by body parts and marital
status. (The two divorced women who function as a gossipy Greek
chorus speak in unbelievably hard-bitten tones about such matters as
the recent murder of their former roommate -- "Such a Karen sort of
thing," Amy said. "Getting killed like that." -- and how much they
lust for a man.)</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, David Todd, the Vietnam vet, with his lovelorn
pursuit of his ex-wife Marla, is the best-drawn character. Flashbacks
to July 1969, when he was wounded, crackle with tension. "The pain
came and went. Sometimes it was nothing. Other times it exceeded
physics." In 1969, David Todd makes a bargain with his
morphine-induced inner devil, who suggests he die where he lies by
the Song Tra Ky River because if he chooses to live, he'll never play
baseball again and Marla will leave him.</TE>
<TE>   This inner voice, in the persona of a radio announcer, presents
O'Brien's version of the male/female dilemma in a nutshell: "Cut your
losses. Check out. Right now, Davy, you don't know what wounded is.
Wait'll the Marla war starts -- all that heartache. You're in for a
world of hurt, my friend, and morphine won't do nothing." Despite the
promise of pain, David chooses life. In this early loss of innocence,
he gets a jump on his classmates. But by reunion time, all of them
have realized that nobody gets out alive -- or unscarred.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is strange that in this portrait of a generation in its
prime, O'Brien does not include a single character who has moved
beyond the loss of innocence to a deeper, more subtle understanding
of the complexities of choice or a character who shows leadership,
wisdom or the generosity to feed back into the younger generations
through family life or work. Although O'Brien has widened his range
to an ensemble in "July, July," his choice of a moral vision based on
high school-era stereotypes and post-traumatic defenses dilutes the
power of his work. One would hope that next time around, he will move
beyond these limits to use his enormous gifts to grapple more
thoroughly with the considerable mysteries of adulthood.</TE>

<BD>Andrew Cockburn is the co-author of "Out of the Ashes:
The Resurrection of Saddam Hussein."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with Saddam Hussein, the former teenage hit man from Tikrit,
our government appears to feel the need to talk as tough as any
Tikriti. Ari Fleischer, speaking from the White House briefing room,
calls for "one bullet" to take care of the Iraqi leader; George Bush
talks blithely of "taking him out"; and Tom Lantos, ranking Democrat
on the House International Relations Committee, recently, according
to Ha'aretz, assured a visiting Israeli lawmaker: "We'll be rid of
the bastard soon enough, and in his place we'll install a pro-Western
dictator, who will be good for us and for you."</LD>
<TE>   Such violent sentiments are not necessarily a reaction to
Hussein's well-documented cruelty. We can, after all, be
understanding about such foibles among our friends. The gassing of
the Kurds was greeted with barely more than a bleat of protest from
Washington, as was his earlier use of chemical weapons in the war
with Iran, but we were allies then. It took Hussein's apparent bid
for control of the world oil market by invading Kuwait to turn him
into "Hitler," capable, as was faithfully reported in the propaganda
buildup to the last Gulf War, of tossing Kuwaiti babies out of
hospital incubators. That myth, dreamed up by the PR firm Hill and
Knowlton, was exposed soon after it had served its purpose. Others,
such as the notion that Hussein is both ready and able to unleash
some super-weapon on the United States, have proved more enduring.</TE>
<TE>   Now more than ever, myth looms larger than reality when it comes
to Iraq, which may be why Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan
has suggested that the dispute be settled in an OK Corral shootout
between Bush and Hussein, flanked by their respective veeps and
umpired by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</TE>
<TE>   In the prologue to "Saddam: King of Terror," Con Coughlin strikes
a no less mythic note, citing as part of the indictment against the
Iraqi leader his links to Osama bin Laden and an alleged meeting in
Prague between hijacker Mohamed Atta and an Iraqi intelligence
officer, a story now effectively discredited by the Czech
intelligence service that spread it in the first place. Once past the
obligatory threat-mongering, however, Coughlin, a British journalist
well-versed in Middle Eastern affairs, deploys more credible sources,
especially the reminiscences of former Baathists who once worked
closely with Hussein, to present an engrossing account of how this
semi-educated peasant boy advanced to power through the bloodstained
shoals of Iraqi revolutionary politics.</TE>
<TE>   While accounts of his subject's brutality and ruthlessness are
familiar, though no less chilling for that, Coughlin reminds us that
Hussein did not achieve his eminence through terror alone. Not only
was he extremely skillful politically -- steadily accumulating power
through the 1970s while maintaining a low profile in the shadow of
his cousin, President Ahmad Hassan Bakr -- he also displayed
considerable constructive talents as an administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi leaders, for example, had long chafed at the control of the
country's oil resources by the cartel of foreign oil corporations
that made up the Iraq Petroleum Co. Efforts by various regimes to
alter this colonial relationship by taking over those oilfields that
the IPC refused to develop had proved fruitless: Among other
disciplinary measures, the international oil companies simply refused
to supply oil to any country that bought oil directly from the Iraqi
government rather than from the IPC.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 1971, Hussein (then deputy to Bakr but already the
key power in the country), advised by the gifted oil minister Murtada
Hadithi, took the initiative in outmaneuvering the cartel. After
first securing the Soviet Union as a great-power sponsor (despite a
career built on persecuting Communists), he induced the French to
break ranks with the consortium by promising them lucrative contracts
and discounted oil prices. The scheme worked, finally allowing Iraq
unfettered access to its own fabulous oil riches. It was, says
Coughlin, "the single most revolutionary event to take place in Iraq
since its establishment" -- one which has doubtless not been
forgotten or forgiven by the oil companies -- generating a tidal wave
of cash, which the Baath used "to turn the country into a modern
state, and to raise the living standards of ordinary Iraqis."</TE>
<TE>   Carrying out this vast undertaking required skilled assistance.
Hussein has always drawn a distinction between "those who are loyal"
and "those who are expert," the former being those very few trusted
individuals -- first and foremost his immediate family -- through
whom he maintains his grip on power. When it comes to experts,
however, Hussein always displayed an eager eye for, as one former
apparatchik recalls, "young people with good qualifications who were
intelligent and courageous." Even today, anyone who encounters his
officials -- such as oil minister Amer Rashid; Amir Sadi, chief
negotiator on the weapon inspection issue; or Foreign Minister Naji
Sabri -- can see that Hussein is served by an impressively
accomplished team. Of course, as the charming Sabri could explain,
competence does not guarantee a long life in Hussein's Baghdad. His
cousin was Hadithi, the former oil minister who later became
ambassador to Moscow. Hadithi was summoned home soon after Hussein
took supreme power in 1979 and executed (perhaps because the newly
enthroned leader did not want anyone around sharing credit for the
oil coup). Sabri's brother was killed as well, and rumor has it that
Sabri himself was on the list until an attentive Hussein struck it
off with the words "not him, he can be useful."</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth M. Pollack's purpose in "The Threatening Storm" is less to
tell a well-rounded story than to argue the case, as declared in his
subtitle, for invading Iraq, displacing Hussein and building a new
Iraq. Pollack, a former CIA analyst and National Security Council
staffer in the Clinton administration, argues that such action is
imperative because Hussein is not only a bloodthirsty tyrant but a
really stupid one to boot, prone to irrational gambles such as the
attack on the Kurds in 1974 as well as the attacks on Iran in 1980
and Kuwait in 1990. Such reckless adventurism, Pollack insists, is a
threat to us because Hussein is on the point of acquiring nuclear
weapons. Therefore, he and every aspect of his regime must be
eliminated as quickly as possible. This martial intervention will
ultimately reverse anti-Americanism in the Arab world once the U.S.
has built a "strong, prosperous, and inclusive new Iraqi state."</TE>
<TE>   Because so much of the "debate" over war with Iraq has barely
risen above the level of sloganeering, Pollack's considered,
empirical style and intellectually rigorous tone is likely to strike
a chord with many undecided observers. Each stage in his argument
comes buttressed with well-footnoted facts and sources (albeit
secondary and mostly non-Iraqi). Still, this is probably the best
presentation of their case that the war party can hope for,
especially because Pollack takes a hardheaded approach to various
postulated alternatives to a full-scale land invasion, such as a
bombing campaign a la Kosovo or a sponsored assault by the Iraqi
opposition with U.S. air support, along the lines of the recent
Afghan campaign. He is surely right in deriding these latter notions,
although I think he has been a little naive about the
opposition-based variant, which was most likely crafted by the
opposition leader Ahmed Chalabi with the express design of drawing
the United States into a full-scale land war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   As with any work of advocacy, facts and viewpoints inconvenient to
the basic thesis sometimes get short shrift. His muddled account of
Hussein's dealings with the Kurds in the mid-'70s -- actually a
masterful display of cunning by "Mr. Deputy" that crushed the threat
of Kurdish separatism for a generation -- may be due to simple
ignorance. However, though he glosses over or fails to mention them,
he must surely be aware of the various covert U.S. interventions in
Iraqi affairs, including the CIA-supported 1963 coup that first put
Hussein's Baath Party in power, or the Carter administration's
encouraging support for Hussein's attack on Iran in 1980. He does
concede that the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad, April Glaspie, might
have led Hussein to believe he had a green light to attack Kuwait,
but he discounts the significance of the encounter.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Pollack refers delicately to Israel's "purported"
nuclear arsenal. This might be dismissed as a mere quibble, save that
the argument of his book -- the case for invading Iraq and occupying
Iraq -- rests on the assumption that a dangerously reckless Hussein
is about to have the bomb, with no "purported" about it. It is this
threat alone -- biological and chemical weapons are not, he
persuasively suggests, instruments of mass destruction because they
are ineffective or at least unpredictable -- that justifies war.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1998, when the last United Nations weapon inspection
mission ended in debacle and a rain of American bombs, the inspectors
concerned with the Iraqi nuclear program were fully satisfied that
the program was dead and buried. One U.S. official supervising the
work of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the institution
charged with Iraqi nuclear disarmament, said to me at the time, "The
United States pushes the IAEA to find little discrepancies in Iraq's
nuclear accounting so that the file can be kept open, but short of
lobotomizing or killing all the Iraqi nuclear scientists, the Iraqi
nuclear program is finished. We have closed down all their nuclear
facilities and activities." And in its October 1998 report to the
U.N., the IAEA itself stated, "There are no indications that there
remains in Iraq any physical capability for the production of
weapon-usable nuclear material of any practical significance."</TE>
<TE>   Such assessments do not find favor with Pollack, who regards
Hussein's acquisition of nuclear weapons as "probably inevitable."
His major source for this conclusion appears to be an exiled Iraqi
nuclear physicist, Khidhir Hamza, who is described without
qualification as "the former head of Iraq's nuclear weapons program."
Hamza, who defected in 1994, claims that Hussein will most likely be
in possession of three nuclear weapons by 2005 (though occasionally
he amends that to "a bomb" within "months"). This individual is
furthermore a key source for the suggestion that Hussein planned to
fire a nuclear warhead, should he have had one available in time, at
Tel Aviv during the Gulf War, thus inviting retaliatory immolation
from Israel. If true, this certainly bolsters the case for Hussein's
being impermissibly reckless.</TE>
<TE>   However, not everyone takes Hamza at his own estimation as
"Saddam's bombmaker." In his forceful debunking of the Iraqi threat,
former senior weapon inspector Scott Ritter states flatly in "War on
Iraq," that Hamza "wasn't a designer and he certainly wasn't head of
the program.... [He] is not who he says he is." David Albright, a
Washington-based expert on nuclear proliferation who helped give
Hamza initial credibility, recently claimed that Hamza exaggerated
his own importance in the Iraqi program and recycled information he
had picked up from the press, including specious revelations about
biological and chemical weapons, as his own firsthand knowledge.
Despite such reservations, Hamza still finds a respectful hearing
among journalists and Congress, despite the lack of confirmation from
other sources. It is telling that, while the United States detected a
North Korean uranium enrichment program in its early stages, the
administration has been unable, despite huge effort, to uncover hard
evidence -- which it would quite certainly broadcast -- of any
similar Iraqi activity.</TE>
<TE>   Ritter, meanwhile, a hero among the hawks, is now vilified, when
he is not ignored, because of his assertions, backed up by detailed
information from his days as a star weapon inspector, that the former
U.N. inspection effort effectively destroyed all Hussein's weapons of
mass destruction as well as his means for constructing them. The very
fact of Ritter's relative obscurity nowadays, compared to people with
more palatable messages, such as Hamza, points to the lack of any
real debate on the official justifications for the proposed invasion.</TE>
<TE>   But then, who needs justifications? In December 1989, the U.S.
attacked Panama on the flimsiest of pretexts and overthrew its
government, killing more than 300 Panamanians in the process. The
invasion was officially code-named "Operation Just Cause." But,
inside the Pentagon, cynics dubbed it "Operation Just Because." As a
former defense official said to me recently, "we invaded Panama just
because it was there and we could."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the same will be said of Iraq.</TE>

<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An unshakable ennui appears to afflict California voters even as we
run up to the general election. None of the attacks and
counterattacks of the leading gubernatorial candidates, for example,
seems to rouse much emotion one way or the other. But the phenomenon
is nothing new, according to Mark Baldassare in "A California State
of Mind: The Conflicted Voter in a Changing World," a study of what
Californians think and feel about the people and institutions that
govern them.</LD>
<LD>   "Distrust in government has a rich history in the California
political context," declares Baldassare. "The state is the home of
the tax revolt in the late 1970s, the birthplace of the Reagan
Revolution in the 1980s, and the headquarters of many political
causes of the left and right in the 1990s that have challenged the
political status quo and questioned the decisions of governmental
authorities."</LD>
<LD>   Baldassare is a leading pollster and a public policy expert at the
Public Policy Institute of California, which is the co-publisher of
"A California State of Mind." Baldassare draws on a recent survey the
institute conducted of 22,000 California residents to plumb the
depths of the voter's psyche. "The last years of the twentieth
century seemed like the best of times in California," he reports.
"Yet its citizens expressed the worst of fears about the future of
the Golden State."</LD>
<TE>   The "yin and yang of California political life," as Baldassare
puts it, were the euphoria of the so-called "New Economy" -- the
spasm of enthusiasm that attended the birth and sudden death of the
dot-com fad -- and what he calls "The New Demography," a grave
concern that government has shown itself unable to cope with the
congestion, pollution and income disparity that have resulted from
California's ever-growing population.</TE>
<TE>   Baldassare, however, does not confine himself to the controversies
of the moment. He reminds us that California is still in the grip of
a tax revolt that began in 1978 with Proposition 13 and the campaign
to put limits on property taxation. He revisits the struggle between
environmentalism and development that has characterized California
politics since John Muir first struggled to save Yosemite. And he
contemplates the implications of the growth in the Latino population
in a chapter titled "The Latino Century Begins."</TE>
<TE>   "The 2000 Census confirmed what some demographers were already
claiming: California was the first large state to enter the uncharted
territory of majority-minority status," he writes. "For the first
time in the state's 150-year history, the white population fell below
50 percent.... Clearly, no topic is more important for the state's
political and economic future than what happens with the Latino
population over the next several decades."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most illuminating tools employed in the survey by
Baldassare and his colleagues was the focus group, and he allows us
to witness the acuity, the lofty aspirations and the sheer despair of
the 170 men and women who were selected to participate and invited to
state their opinions rather than just respond to an opinion poll.
"Planning," says one participant in a focus group on growth and
environment, "is after-the-fact crisis management." On the subject of
the changing demographics of California, another member says:
"Diversity is always better." And a third member says: "[T]he energy
crisis has totally shaken my belief in the government having a grip
on what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the cynicism and distrust that California voters
feel toward government, writes Baldassare, California has become "the
'un-party' state." Democrats may have fared well at the polls in the
last decade, but Baldassare insists that "growing political clout has
come to rest outside of the major parties -- in the dual form of
independent voters and an enthusiastic use of the initiative
process."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most significant insight in "A California State of
Mind" is Baldassare's insistence that Californians were already
growing anxious about the future when we were caught up in the boom
times that lingered through the 2000 elections. Thus, he credits
Californians for a degree of realism and even prescience that many of
our politicians seem to lack.</TE>
<TE>   "[I]t took little probing to recognize that there was only a
superficial sense of happiness about the state of the state," he
concludes. "Californians knew that their current prosperity, in and
of itself, could not address future issues. Only the government could
do that, but it was not addressing these issues, and there were
serious doubts that it was up to the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Baldassare's prime readership, to be sure, consists of politicians
and political consultants and policy wonks for whom his insights
amount to a kind of intelligence briefing. But he writes with clarity
and verve about even the most arcane issues, and -- perhaps mindful
of the limited capacity of the general reader for the minutiae of
public-opinion polling -- he confines his comments on "multiple
regressions" and "B values" and "positive correlations" to the
footnotes. As a result, his book is fully accessible to precisely
those "conflicted voters" whose pulse he has taken and whose concerns
and aspirations he has affirmed in these pages.</TE>
<TE>   A brighter and more surprising picture of life in California is
painted by sociologist Jennifer Lee in "Civility in the City: Blacks,
Jews, and Koreans in Urban America," a remarkable book that focuses
on the mom-and-pop businesses in the inner city as a laboratory where
we can study how blacks, Jews and Koreans actually perceive and deal
with each other. Lee's conclusions contradict what we were shown in
Spike Lee's film "Do the Right Thing" or the news footage of the 1992
Los Angeles riots: "[C]ivility prevails in everyday life because
merchants and their employees actively work to preserve it."</TE>
<TE>   "Images of urban riots, 'bloodsucking' Jewish and Korean
storeowners, picket lines, and firebombings have seared into the
public's consciousness the idea that racial warfare is a fact of life
in black communities," Lee explains. "I argue that media accounts and
past research have been biased toward conflict and controversy and do
not reflect the full range of merchant-customer relations in black
communities." Rather, Lee insists that as a result of conscious
effort by business owners and their employees, "everyday interactions
between Jewish, Korean and African American merchants and their black
customers are ... positive, civil and routine."</TE>
<TE>   Like "A California State of Mind," Lee's book is a scholarly
study. She employs "an ethnomethodological lens" to study human
behavior from the stance of a sociologist. But, again like
Baldassare, she explains herself in plain language: "[M]y focus is on
the everyday and the local," she writes, "rather than on larger
events like riots or boycotts." Thus, for example, she is alert to
such subtle factors as eye contact and facial expression in the
dealings between a merchant and a customer, and she shows us how
their "prosaic and humanizing encounters" offer the hope that we can,
in fact, all get along.</TE>

<HD>The cultural flowering of Germany's Jews</HD>
<DH>The Pity of It All: A History of the Jews in Germany,
1743-1933, Amos Elon, Metropolitan Books: 448 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Laqueur</AU>
<BD>Walter Laqueur is the editor of "The Holocaust
Encyclopedia" and the author of many books, including "A History of
Zionism" and "Generation Exodus: The Fate of Young Jewish Refugees
From Nazi Germany."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of Jews living in Germany was tiny, never more than 1% of
the nation's population and less toward the end, with the advent of
Hitler. But their share in the cultural, social and economic life was
far in excess, and their prominence might have been a reason for
their undoing. Their contribution to science, the humanities,
literature and the theater was enormous; in the plastic arts and
music, they acted as catalysts, as leading sponsors and agents of new
forms and contents. Even an anti-Semite like Wagner owed much of his
triumph to his Jewish admirers.</LD>
<LD>   This great role of a small minority is all the more remarkable as
the exodus of the German Jews from the medieval ghetto came only late
in the day. In 1743, a 14-year-old boy from the provinces walked 100
miles of hilly countryside to arrive in Berlin (as yet closed to all
but a handful of privileged Jews) to serve as tutor to the children
of one of these families. Moses Mendelssohn (the grandfather of the
composer) would later become the interlocutor of some of the leading
cultural figures of the day, and, more important, the pioneer of
Jewish emancipation -- or, as latter-day critics would say, of
assimilation.</LD>
<TE>   It took another hundred years for German Jews to get de jure
equality, longer for de facto acceptance. From the early 1800s up to
1918, it was virtually impossible for a Jew to serve as a government
official, let alone as a reserve army officer (a crucial status
symbol in Imperial Germany) even though they were required to serve
in the army. The German-Jewish symbiosis, in other words, lasted for
less than a century. But it is also true, as Amos Elon notes in his
new book, "The Pity of It All: A History of Jews in Germany,
1743-1933," that Germany was by no means the most anti-Semitic
country in Europe, as some historians have argued.</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, the overwhelming majority of Jews in Germany were
patriots and optimistic. During the century before World War I,
German Jewry lost most of its upper class; many, especially among the
wealthy and the educated, converted to Christianity either out of a
genuine conviction to do so, or else because they could not get, for
instance, a professorship or a judgeship as a Jew. The percentage of
mixed marriages was so high that some concerned demographers
predicted the virtual disappearance of German Jewry within three, or
at most, four generations.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, the very concept of a German-Jewish symbiosis came
under bitter attack by, among others, Gershom Scholem, the great
German-Jewish scholar of mysticism. As Scholem saw it, this love
affair had been strictly one-sided, a chase after a chimera: The
desire of many young Jews to be accepted by German society at almost
any price was aesthetically displeasing, devoid of dignity and
accompanied on occasion by self-hate. But it should be recalled that
Jewish heritage -- after so many generations of stifling ghetto life
-- was hard-pressed to compete with the attraction of Goethe,
Beethoven, the Romantics and European culture in general. All that
remained was a heavy emphasis on meaningless rituals; having been
born Jewish was for many nothing but a stigma, and it came as no
surprise that after three generations, not a single of Mendelssohn's
many descendants was still Jewish. In the often-quoted words of
Heinrich Heine, baptism seemed the entry ticket to European
civilization.</TE>
<TE>   Elon shows greater empathy for the converts and the non-Jewish
Jews than for those who tried hard to find some positive content in
Judaism. Martin Buber is called narcissistically obsessive, Felix
Theilhaber hysterical, and historian Heinrich Graetz appears a
narrow-minded simpleton. For the historian of ideas, the non-Jewish
Jews are far more interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Elon describes the rise of anti-Semitism both on the ideological
and popular level during the 19th century. But with all this, German
Jews were doing well; if the grandfathers had been hawking goods in
the countryside, the sons had a shop and the grandson quite often
went into a profession, usually medicine or the law. Frequently, Jews
became booksellers, and selling books was the stepping stone to
publishing. By the end of the century, they were in the forefront of
German cultural life.</TE>
<TE>   What caused such a burst of creativity? A variety of reasons have
been adduced: the stimulus of suffering, tribal pressure, the
interplay between challenge and response. For all one knows it might
have been a mixture of all these and a number of other factors. But
in the final analysis, we do not know, just as one cannot account for
the flowering of painting in the Netherlands in the 17th century or
of music in Austria at the end of the 18th century or German
classicism and romanticism in literature.</TE>
<TE>   They welcomed like all others the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71
and even more so World War I in 1914. Elon exaggerates a bit
describing as unique the support of German (and Jewish) intellectuals
for their government's bellicose policy. It was indeed not a page of
glory in the history of the German intelligentsia, and unique it was
not. French martial enthusiasm in 1914 was equal, and philosopher
Henri Bergson (whom Elon quotes as an example for a more detached
attitude) was anything but an opponent of the war.</TE>
<TE>   In this book, Elon goes over ground that is not exactly virgin
soil. Although there still are some major lacunas, an enormous
literature has been created since World War II on German Jewry. Few
groups of people in the annals of mankind have been as thoroughly
studied as Germany's Jews. But it is also true that most of this
literature has not been written for a wider public. This book has
much to recommend itself: The author did his homework, he immersed
himself in the existing literature, he writes well, he is a master of
the telling anecdote, and his judgment cannot often be faulted.</TE>
<TE>   It is less certain, however, whether it can be considered a
history of the Jews in Germany. For instance, Elon says there is
little religious content in the work of Albert Einstein, Sigmund
Freud, Gustav Mahler, Stefan Zweig, Franz Werfel, Edmund Husserl,
Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Paul Ehrlich, Richard Willstatter, Fritz
Mauthner or Franz Kafka. This is a perfectly correct statement, but
there is something curious with this list (and similar ones in this
book); of the 11 luminaries he mentions, most were not German
citizens, and six were not Jews. They had either converted or
otherwise had formally dissociated themselves from the Jewish
community.</TE>
<TE>   We live in an age in which the term "Jew" and "Jewish" is used
even more broadly than by the authors of the Nazi Nuremberg Laws in
1935. Obviously, a book titled "Hitler's Jewish Soldiers" will
attract more attention that one called "Hitler's Quarter-Jewish
Soldiers." But this custom should be resisted. A great many of those
appearing in this book belong to wholly different traditions --
namely Vienna and Prague. German was their native language, but they
were not part of German Jewry.</TE>
<TE>   There is another, even more weighty, reason. "The Pity of It All"
deals essentially with the great figures of that period, the wealthy
and the famous. But the great majority of German Jews were neither
Nobel Prize winners nor multimillionaires, but middle-class merchants
or lower-middle-class artisans or even working-class people. Not very
interesting people perhaps, but they were German Jewry, not Hugo von
Hofmannsthal. Could a history of French Jewry be written focusing
mainly on Jacques Offenbach, Pissarro, Proust and Leon Blum? Or one
on Jews in Britain that concentrated on Disraeli, Viscount Samuel and
Siegfried Sassoon?</TE>
<TE>   Elon could argue that the situation in Germany was different
because the cultural contribution of the Jews was so much greater.
True, but the overwhelming majority still did not belong to the
intellectual elite. There was a significant number of religious
orthodox among them, as well as of Ostjuden, those recently arrived
from the East. Readers of a history of Jews in Germany would like to
know about how they lived and where they lived and what they did,
about their manifold organizations, their schools, their religious
leaders, their publications and so on -- not very inspiring stuff
perhaps, but essential in a history of this kind.</TE>
<TE>   In brief, one should be grateful for what Elon has done, but the
history of an intellectual elite is not a history of a far broader
community. Perhaps he can be prevailed upon to change the subtitle in
future editions.</TE>

<HD>What the church owes Jews, and itself</HD>
<DH>A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Catholic Church in the
Holocaust and Its Unfulfilled Duty of Repair, Daniel Jonah Goldhagen,
Alfred A. Knopf: 346 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John K. Roth</AU>
<BD>John K. Roth, professor of philosophy at Claremont
McKenna College, is the co-editor of "Good News After Auschwitz?
Christian Faith Within a Post-Holocaust World" as well as "Pope Pius
XII and the Holocaust."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Daniel Goldhagen's first book, "Hitler's Willing Executioners,"
was published in 1996, it ignited controversy for arguing that
ordinary Germans, not just the SS and Nazi party members, chose to
implement the Final Solution. Goldhagen was widely criticized for
views that seemed oversimplified, empirically questionable and
arrogantly argued, but as time passed -- and especially owing to the
book's favorable reception in Germany -- his work withstood much of
the criticism.</LD>
<LD>   Such a reaction undoubtedly awaits "A Moral Reckoning," a book
that vigorously challenges the Roman Catholic Church to take
responsibility for its role in the Holocaust. According to Goldhagen,
Pope Pius XII was an anti-Semite and the church was "more a
collaborator than a victim of Nazism." He argues that the New
Testament's "libelous and hate-inducing passages about Jews" must go,
and he calls for a radical reformation to remove from Christianity
the anti-Semitism that implicated it in the Holocaust and still
leaves that tradition immorally mired in deception and hypocrisy.</LD>
<TE>   "Unpretentious," "indecisive," "moderate" and "patient" are not
words that come to mind when reading Goldhagen. Insisting that it is
high time to "call a spade a spade," he has written a post-Holocaust
moral reckoning with Christianity, and the Roman Catholic Church in
particular, that pulls few punches and guarantees a hard-hitting bout
over history, ethics and theology. Goldhagen's book is unlikely to
leave its readers indifferent. Its significance, however, depends
less on immediate reactions and more on what happens 10, 20 or even
100 years after its appearance. Goldhagen may be helping to create a
new Christianity. It will take time to tell.</TE>
<TE>   Goldhagen's reckoning begins in two places. First, he believes
that the Roman Catholic Church, the Vatican and the wartime popes,
Pius XI and especially Pius XII, should be judged no differently than
any other institutions or persons -- with one qualification: The
church, its members and particularly its leaders should be held
accountable to the highest ethical standards of justice and love that
they profess as Christians. Second, Goldhagen places anti-Semitism at
the heart of his indictment. Deeply rooted in falsehoods about Jews
-- none worse than the New Testament's allegation that the Jews are
Christ-killers or even the offspring of Satan -- anti-Semitism's many
varieties reflect and inflame hostility against Jews "simply because
they are Jews."</TE>
<TE>   Goldhagen acknowledges that the post-Holocaust church has
gradually repudiated the allegations of Jewish responsibility for the
killing of Jesus. It has also rejected collective Jewish guilt and
punishment for that crime. Before and during the Holocaust, however,
such repudiations by Christians -- Protestants as well as Catholics
-- were few and far between. To the contrary, Goldhagen documents
that the church's anti-Semitism was institutional. As the church's
anti-Jewish teachings were transmitted from one generation to
another, Western civilization became increasingly drenched in
anti-Semitism's poison.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-Semitism that Christianity embodied, inspired and
inflamed was "eliminationist." Clarifying a point central to
controversy that swirled when "Hitler's Willing Executioners"
appeared, Goldhagen underscores that eliminationist anti-Semitism
"does not necessarily mean killing" Jews and that "the Catholic
Church was doctrinally opposed to, and itself did not advocate,
killing Jews." That said, Goldhagen adds that the lack of persistent
and public church protest against the Third Reich's slaughter of
European Jewry scarcely inspires confidence that the church was
completely opposed to the mass annihilation.</TE>
<TE>   Goldhagen rejects the apologetics that excuse the lack of public
protest against the persecution and murder of Jews. He utterly
rejects any reasoning that tries to excuse Pope Pius XII in
particular on the grounds that if he had spoken out more forthrightly
in their favor, then the Jews would have suffered even more under
Hitler. Cutting in the opposite direction, his analysis of the
evidence points to a devastating conclusion: The church found that
"letting Jews die was preferable to intervening on their behalf."
Goldhagen's analysis leaves a nagging suspicion. Despite deplorably
bloody tactics in which the church would not involve itself directly,
did its leaders feel, without ever saying so, that it would be
beneficial to be rid of the Jews, one way or another?</TE>
<TE>   In a fundamental disagreement with "We Remember," the Roman
Catholic Church's official statement on the Holocaust in 1998,
Goldhagen finds the church speaking nonsense when it asserts that the
Nazis' racial anti-Semitism "had its roots outside of Christianity."
He argues persuasively that "the church's accusations against Jews
were often virtually indistinguishable from those of the racist
antisemites."</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the Holocaust, for example, Nazi and Catholic
anti-Semitism agreed that the Jews were increasingly linked to
communism, an ideology that Pope Pius XII and many other Catholic
leaders loathed. Goldhagen shows that "examples of the Church's
incitement to radical anti-Jewish action are legion." Absent the
seedbed and support provided by Christian anti-Semitism, the Nazis'
racist anti-Semitism could not have been so powerfully credible to
the Germans and their allies, who eventually attempted the total
elimination of the Jews in the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   Other critics have made similar points long before Goldhagen, but
he goes further than most in holding the church accountable.
Accountability requires truth telling and restitution. The church,
Goldhagen appropriately contends, has not told the whole truth about
its anti-Semitism and its failure during the Holocaust. A moral
reckoning requires it to do so, but that step would not be
sufficient. The church, Goldhagen adds, must make amends to Jews and
reform itself.</TE>
<TE>   Goldhagen uses the word "must" frequently and unabashedly. His
list of "musts" for the church is as challenging as it is long.
Especially after the Holocaust, three types of restitution are
crucial: material, political and moral. Wherever the church was
implicated in exploiting Jews or in expropriating their property, it
must work to set every account straight. Goldhagen notes that the
German Catholic Church has taken steps in that direction, and he
gives credit where it is due. Political restitution is more
complicated, because Goldhagen links it to the state of Israel. At
the very least, he insists, the church will fail in its moral
responsibility toward Jews if it acts to "weaken the foundation of
Israel" or takes measures that "might imperil its existence or the
lives of many of its citizens." If those arguably vague criteria
create a minefield, moral restitution does so even more.</TE>
<TE>   The most basic task of moral restitution -- eradicate
anti-Semitism from Christianity -- sounds simple, but it is not. The
changes must go deep down because anti-Semitism lies at the very
roots of Christianity. What, then, should the church do, and how must
it change? For starters, the church should halt immediately the
canonization of any person -- read Pius XII specifically -- who aided
and abetted the persecution of Jews.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the church must recognize that anti-Semitism has been
inseparable from its authoritarian and imperialistic pretensions and
must abandon papal infallibility, dissolve the Vatican as a political
state, embrace religious pluralism to make clear that salvation does
not come through the church alone and revise its official catechism
to make unmistakable that any teaching smacking of anti-Semitism is
"wrong, null and void."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest issue, however, is the church's "Bible problem."
Goldhagen's reading of the New Testament leaves him with two striking
impressions: First, Christianity is "a religion of love that teaches
its members the highest moral principles for acting well. Love your
neighbor. Seek peace. Help those in need. Sympathize with and raise
up the oppressed. Do to others as you would have them do to you."
Second, the New Testament's "relentless and withering assault on Jews
and Judaism" is not incidental because it portrays the Jews as "the
ontological enemy" of Jesus, goodness and God.</TE>
<TE>   The "Bible problem," moreover, is not just that two apparently
contradictory perspectives collide but that the collision takes place
in texts that are regarded as sacred and divinely inspired. The need,
Goldhagen contends, is for Christians to rewrite the New Testament,
to expunge anti-Semitism from it, but he recognizes how difficult,
perhaps insurmountable, that task may be. Nevertheless, Goldhagen
does not despair. He thinks that the Christian tradition can be
self-corrective, resilient and revitalized if Christians find the
will to be true to their tradition's best teachings about love and
justice.</TE>
<TE>   Goldhagen does not presume to rewrite the New Testament. Nor does
he venture to define everything that a truly post-Holocaust church
should be. His book contains touches of modesty after all. Meanwhile,
if the Roman Catholic Church, and by implication all churches, moved
in his direction, it would not be the first time that a Jewish
teacher has shown Christians the way. Goldhagen seems to be betting
that Christianity can gain new life by letting its old one die. How
many Christians will welcome such prospects remains unknown, but such
hope should be familiar to them. It would be good for post-Holocaust
followers of Jesus to embrace it.</TE>

<DH>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, A Novel, Sloan Wilson,
Four Walls Eight Windows: 280 pp., $13.95 paper</DH>

<AU>James Wolcott</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's hard stifling a hippo yawn whenever the fiction of the 1950s is
discussed. Inevitably, the same novels are laid upon the altar.
"Invisible Man." "The Adventures of Augie March." "The Catcher in the
Rye." "From Here to Eternity." But some of the defining novels of the
1950s loiter on the pop outskirts of literary permanence, addictive
middlebrow potboilers that may never be inducted into the Modern
Library and yet continue to beckon. I'm thinking of such classic
paperback-rack sensations as Grace Metalious' "Peyton Place," Meyer
Levin's "Compulsion" and the novel with the most ghostly grip of them
all, Sloan Wilson's "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit."</LD>
<TE>   A blockbuster upon publication in 1955 ("Over 2 million copies
sold" boasts the 1966 paperback edition), the novel captured and
bottled a floating anxiety, a sour malaise, that belied the peppy
froth of Patti Page records and TV jingles. Like "The Organization
Man" and "The Lonely Crowd," its title became an instant catch
phrase, an ID badge for a queasy decade. Over time, the tag peeled
off and floated around loose, mixed up in some readers' minds with
the title of Mary McCarthy's post-coital story "The Man in the Brooks
Brothers Shirt." The reissue of "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit" by
Four Walls Eight Windows pastes the label back on the original
contents. This is one 1950s revival that doesn't tickle with
nostalgia. The writing is vigorous, unvarnished, tartly observant;
its overhanging disquietude isn't dated -- if anything, it's
deepened. To ensure relevance, this edition features a new and
somewhat nasal introduction by bestselling novelist Jonathan Franzen,
author of "The Corrections."</TE>
<TE>   Like Rod Serling's "The Twilight Zone," another strange marriage
of humanistic ideals and atomic dread, "The Man in the Gray Flannel
Suit" has a plain, humdrum surface that stretches like a flimsy plank
over the abyss. One slip could result in starless freefall. Its hero
even has his own existential mantra, warding off fear before each
major step into the unknown by repeating to himself, "It doesn't
really matter. Here goes nothing ...."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Rath, the novel's protagonist, resides with his wife and kids
in a suburban home in Westport, Conn., that no one would ever mistake
for the tidy nest in "Father Knows Best." It's a hunched eyesore
beset with weeds, mildew and "a thousand petty shabbinesses," a
monument to futility. A crack in the plaster in the shape of a
question mark haunts the living room as if the house itself were
crying, "What went wrong? Why am I falling apart?"</TE>
<TE>   Puttering sideways in a job at a charitable foundation, Rath is
unable to maintain the homestead, much less renovate, an inadequacy
flaunted in his face at every neighborhood cocktail party. "Budgets
were frankly discussed, and the public celebration of increases in
salary was common. The biggest parties of all were moving-out
parties, given by those who were finally able to buy a bigger house"
-- i.e., leave the old dump behind. Those who don't aspire to attain
a larger pile of lumber elsewhere are eyed as losers: "On Greentree
Avenue, contentment was an object of contempt."</TE>
<TE>   Rath chances into a nebulous job in the PR department of a
broadcasting company that promises a bigger paycheck and possible
advancement. Hired to help package and promote a hazily conceived
public awareness campaign for mental health -- the pet project of the
company's president, Ralph Hopkins -- he learns fast that proximity
to the boss doesn't spare him from being browbeaten by his immediate
higher-ups. A paratrooper during World War II (the flashback battle
scenes have the erratic pulse, sudden reversals and ground-hugging
confusion of Stephen Crane's "The Red Badge of Courage"), Rath soon
grasps that corporate bureaucracy has become a postwar extension of
military hierarchy and regimentation and that his war record doesn't
compensate for lack of business experience. His virgin status and
vague role reduce him to a raw recruit in a civilian army in which
executives are the officer corps, the gray flannel suit is "the
uniform of the day" and the CEO is more than a general, he's a
supreme thinker perched at the aerie of the corporate pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   The stupendous vistas that greet Rath from the windows of Hopkins'
penthouse office create the illusion of the floor as a floating
stage, "a platform suspended in mid-air." Popping out from behind his
vast desk, Hopkins strikes the reader at first as a walking
anticlimax and Babbitty cliche, a windup toy of can-do energy and
vacuous chitchat. It's a charade that over the course of the novel
poignantly unravels. Like Rath (who, having survived the war, can't
fathom why he's still scared -- "I thought peace was supposed to be
peaceful"), Hopkins is racked by unspecified wants and hungers, a
hollow sense of something missing, something climactic.</TE>
<TE>   A novel with a liberal soul and a roiled disposition, "The Man in
the Gray Flannel Suit" is also a saddening social document, a glimpse
into how far America's civic bonds and business ethics have fallen
from honor and integrity over almost a half-century. It's a piercing
reminder of what the Fortune 500 world was like before free-market
fundamentalists got a rigid dose of Ayn Rand and took to the airwaves
and think tanks to sneer at social responsibility as a sentimental
weakness, a sissy concern.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the pursuit of wealth is still a test of character. "Now
there are two kinds of rich -- foolish rich and responsible rich,"
Hopkins lectures his spoiled party-girl daughter, about to elope with
a wilted playboy. He explains that a million dollars isn't an
abstract sum but the life earnings of six average workers: "I'm
saying that when you hold a million dollars in your hand, you are in
a very real sense holding the entire working lives of six men, and
you better be damn careful what you do with it!" A lesson the
foolish, irresponsible CEOs of Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, Global Crossing
and countless others either forgot or never learned, clapping on a
feedbag filled with loans and stock options to finance baronial
mansions and art collections, leaving the workers whose well-being
they squandered to pick through the scraps of their 401(k)s.</TE>
<TE>   Those who inherit wealth also have a duty not to hog it, the novel
says. Summoned to the bedside of his widowed grandmother, a selfish
old crow who could give Hopkins' debutante daughter lessons on how to
fritter away a fortune, Rath releases a poison cloud inside his head:
"She's dying, he thought. She's lived ninety-three years, and it's
all been a free ride. She's never cooked a meal, or made a bed, or
washed a diaper, or done a damn  thing for herself or anybody else.
She's spent at least three million dollars, and her only comment has
been that money is boring. She's had a free ride for ninety-three
years, and I'm damned if I'll cry about the end of it."</TE>
<TE>   Money is the monkey on everybody's back in "The Man in the Gray
Flannel Suit." Few novels go as deep under the skin to take a nerve
reading of the escalating costs of the American Dream, the price of
personal sacrifice required to thrive in a system that rewards the
fanatically single-minded -- the whippet-thin workaholics who brag
about needing only four hours of sleep a night. When Rath finally
opts out of the rat race, not wanting to end up like Hopkins, whose
business empire houses the dud shell of his desolate personal life,
it isn't an unimpeachable decision. The novel doesn't take easy
sides, recognizing that irreconcilable outlooks may both be right.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Rath is right to choose family and community over
high-salaried servitude, but Hopkins has opposing truth on his side
when he wheels on Rath and uncharacteristically blusters, "Somebody
has to do the big jobs! This world was built by men like me! To
really do a job, you have to live it, body and soul! You people who
just give half your mind to your work are riding on our backs!" ("I
know it," Rath replies.) Although the novel ends on a church-bell
note of affirmation, its darker chords linger, subverting the
official optimism of the Eisenhower era, much as did those films
noirs in which happy endings were tacked on as fig leaves.</TE>
<TE>   In an age of casual Fridays, the gray flannel suit is no longer
the commuter's prison uniform, and three-martini lunches are nearly
extinct. Yet our enthrallment with money, real estate, expensive toys
and social prestige is more slavish than it was in those station
wagon days. If the post-bubble economy continues to slide, the
question mark on Tom Rath's crumbling wall may make a comeback --
this time as an omen.</TE>

<HD>Romancing the soul</HD>
<DH>The Green Hour, A Novel, Frederic Tuten, W.W. Norton: 256
pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Howard</AU>
<BD>Richard Howard, a poet and translator, teaches
literature in Columbia University's School of the Arts (writing
division).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The title of Frederic Tuten's fifth work of fiction identifies that
wonder working interval when Parisians, according to their
notoriously symbolic program, resort to cafes to seek a heightened or
at least an altered state of being wrought by the verdant
transformations of "Lethe's livid absinthe." Thus the reader is
alerted to the probable nature of the present elegant fable, its
desperate readiness to discard the conventions of realism, although
this author's previous books, in their different ways (Tuten is
eager, and equipped, to try anything), had served similar notice from
the start, which was "The Adventures of Mao on the Long March" 20
years back, praised by Updike as "an intelligent, taut and
entertaining change from conventional novels." Then came "Tallien: A
Brief Romance," which disposed of the French Revolution in 150 pages
of mordant frivolity; then Tuten's masterpiece to date, "Tintin in
the New World," which persists in the analysis and futility of
revolution in terms of figures from the old French comic strip; and
six years ago, "Van Gogh's Bad Cafe," whose romantic personnel steps
out of those sun-baked oils, foreshadowing some of the cultural and
academic altercations of this new book.</LD>
<TE>   "The Green Hour" is also a romance, although our heroine,
red-haired Dominique, is not so much a person as a soul, the Soul of
Modern Woman, who emblematically enough has survived cancer (although
the disease remains a constant menace) and has obtained a similarly
oppressive doctorate in art history, her loyalties divided between
elusive red-haired (get it?) Rex, a manipulative yet irresistible
womanizer, and patiently loving (and Fabulously Wealthy Older Man)
Eric, an echo of Dominique's thesis advisor -- sage and kindly
Professor Morin, who opens the book with a blast of rueful sagesse.</TE>
<TE>   It is Eric who wins the last round after decades of time out for
Rex, who constitutes an ongoing sexual threat whenever he allows
Dominique to get at him -- the lure of the evasive. Even in such
summary (and unfair) delineations, it should be apparent that the
reader is not presented with "characters" in the Cliffs Notes sense
of the affair, but once again with "figures," iconic energies with
which to take sides as they divvy up the narrative. For example, here
on the last page:</TE>
<TE>   "Dominique went to her computer, opening her journal of fragments.
Freud had said that the individual as well as the world was in
conflict between its wish for love and its wish for death. She wrote
that death, Thanatos, not love, Eros, had won the century's last
round. She had come to grandiose conclusions, but there were others
closer to home which she could more easily justify. For her, Eros and
Thanatos were not distinct forces but were one.... Like Cupid in
Poussin's painting, who had caused Narcissus to drown and Echo to
transmute into stone, Love had been her Death. But she was not dead
yet."</TE>
<TE>   I suspect that the readers this exceptional writer deserves (he is
frequently elegant and always intelligent in his spiritual
accounting; his arguments for and against the course of passion and
the life of the mind, no less) will be startled and perhaps daunted
by the strange elisions of naturalism for the sake of philosophical
position, and then by the even stranger forsaking of Goya versus
Poussin (the running academic argument throughout the timeless "Green
Hour") for the sake of what directors call stage business. As
Browning says, "What of soul was left, I wonder, when the kissing had
to stop?"</TE>
<TE>   Yet Hawthorne would have abounded in the sense of this grim little
romance, with all its exotic filler (scenes of Parisian extravagance
and Manhattan prodigality), for the sake of its spooky radiance, for
its intensities of conduct in the war between life and art, and love
and death, and between knowing and believing. Once again, Tuten
reaches for another kind of fiction -- a lyric condition of the
downward spirit, in its mysterious connivance with its own wreck.</TE>

<HD>A miniaturist and uncanny genius</HD>
<DH>Regions of the Great Heresy: Bruno Schulz, a Biographical
Portrait, Jerzy Ficowski, Translated from the Polish by Theodosia
Robertson, W.W. Norton: 256 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Clive James</AU>
<BD>Clive James is the author of, among other works,
"Falling Toward England" and "The Silver Castle" and the forthcoming
"As Of This Writing: The Essential Essays."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a writer, a painter and a man, Bruno Schulz believed that the aim
of life was to mature into childhood. With its overtones of me-speak,
of getting in touch with one's inner child, Schulz's belief might
look like yet another reason for not getting in touch with him. He
didn't write a lot, and a lot of what he did write was in a Polish
difficult even for Poles; he is hard to translate. Nearly all of what
he painted went missing. He is one of those creative spirits from
what Philip Roth called "the other Europe," the Europe beyond the
Elbe, whose reputations tend to stay there because it is hard to
airlift them out. If we add to all that the notion that he was a
toy-cuddling advocate of infantilism, he could be lost to us indeed.
But the truth of his mentality was anything but infantile: It was a
penetrating realization that the perceptual store of our early
childhood forms what he called "the iron capital" of the adult
imagination.</LD>
<TE>   The realization was itself realized in his two little books of
short stories, "Cinnamon Shops" (otherwise known as "The Street of
Crocodiles") and "Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass": the
two little books that constitute the bulk of his writing as it has
come down to us, and which are enough by themselves to make him a
weighty figure. Nobody quite matches him for seeing everyday objects
in three dimensions and evoking them as if the fourth dimension,
time, had been erased. Making a mythology from the actual, he
convinces us that the actual is made from myths. Reading him, we feel
as our own children must feel when we are reading them the words of
Maurice Sendak while they are looking at the pictures. Colors
breathe. Textures pulse. The butcher, the baker and the candlestick
maker loom like totem poles. And it is all done in such a short span,
in paragraphs worth chapters and chapters worth a book. There might
have been another, longer work -- the novel usually called "The
Messiah" -- but if the manuscript ever existed, it vanished, as the
paintings and all other possibilities of future work vanished, along
with his future. On a scale measured by his potential achievement, he
died young.</TE>
<TE>   In fact he had already turned 50 when he was murdered, but we are
right to think of him as still beginning because it was always the
way he thought of himself. So it was an untimely end, as well as a
terrible one. If only it had been uniquely terrible. Alas, it was a
commonplace. He was one more Jew rubbed out by the Nazis. The
circumstances, in his case, were merely unusual. In the Drohobycz
ghetto, a Gestapo officer with good taste, one Felix Landau, had made
a pet of him so that he could paint murals. In November 1942, on a
day of "wild action" -- that is, a day when the Nazis ran around
shooting people at random instead of rounding them up to be shipped
off in batches, as on an ordinary day -- Schulz's protector took his
eye off his human property. Landau had a jealous rival, another
Gestapo officer, Karl Gunther. Landau had once shot Gunther's pet
dentist, so Gunther took the opportunity to get square. He put two
bullets through Schulz's head. If we find ourselves hoping that the
first bullet did the job, it is because it is so hard to bear the
idea that Schulz might have had even a split second to reach the
false conclusion that his life had come to nothing.</TE>
<TE>   It was a conclusion he had always been apt to reach even in normal
circumstances. One of the many ironies of his life was that the Nazis
made actual the torment of uncertainty in which he had lived and
worked since his adolescence. Insecurity, indecisiveness and
diffidence were marks of his personality. He was one of those
geniuses blessed with an uncanny creative ability and cursed with an
almost equally uncanny inability to do anything practical about it.
From Jerzy Ficowski's biography, this pitiably tentative personality
emerges so sharply that it is likely to make us impatient, but
decency and a sense of proportion demand that we should rein our
impatience in: It was, after all, the condition for his
inventiveness, which was the opposite of tentative and indeed looks
bolder as time goes by. By extension, it would be wise not to become
impatient with this biography. It has been a long time getting to us.
The first version was published in 1967. This translation is of an
expanded version, but it still has some of the marks of a thesis.
"The attainment of the Schulzian artistic postulate led me to a state
of feverish ecstasy" is not a heartening sentence to meet early on.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily there are better sentences to be met later, when we are
told that Schulz's jeweler's glass was a kaleidoscope and that he had
a way of being mathematically precise about myth. If such statements
are not perfectly transparent, they are at least usefully suggestive
and thus fall into the realm of true criticism. A more worrying
feature is not the presence of jargon but the absence of a complete
historical context. The Nazis are on parade, but the Communists are
not. Introducing the book, which she translated, Theodosia Robertson
tells us that Ficowski kept Schulz studies alive in Poland during the
1950s and 1960s despite "enormous obstacles," but she doesn't tell us
what those obstacles were. More remarkably, Ficowski doesn't tell us
either. We assume that the obstacles were political. Communist Poland
found it hard to be proud of the great modern Polish writers, because
they would not cooperate. There were attempts to lure Witold
Gombrowicz home, but they failed. Czeslaw Milosz remained resolutely
unavailable, and indeed his masterly long essay "The Captive Mind"
can now be seen as one of the first wedges driven between the planks
of the Warsaw Pact.</TE>
<TE>   Schulz, being safely dead, might have been more pliant, but there
was something subversive about him. Any graduate of the Polish film
and acting schools in the 1970s can tell you what it was. "What we
got from him," says a Polish actress of my acquaintance, "was
luxury." She didn't mean the high life. She meant the way he brought
out the riches of the ordinary life he led in the few hundred square
yards of Drohobycz that he knew intimately and almost never left. He
brought out the quality of things: things to eat, chairs to sit on,
curtains of different weaves, the cart rattling out of the dark. And
he brought out the diversity of people, all observed minutely as
individuals, sometimes elevated to the status of mythical beings but
never classified as types or members of a class. He was about as far
from socialist realism as you could get. In preserving and furthering
Schulz's reputation, Ficowski was plowing a lonely furrow. Active in
the intellectual movement that helped prepare the advent of
Solidarity, he himself was an underground writer from 1977 onward. He
is amply qualified to tell the story of the Communist state's
attitude to his touchy subject, but he doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps he is worn out from trying to ride two horses at once.
After it turned out that a few of Schulz's murals had survived after
all, Ficowski was on the spot, and understandably put out, when
agents of Yad Vashem intervened to pack up some of the most precious
fragments and ship them to Israel. A cultural version of the Raid on
Entebbe, the caper raised not only a scandal but also a false
question: Had Schulz been a Pole or a Jew? Ficowski, surely rightly,
wants Schulz to be both but runs a danger of tipping the balance if
he puts too much emphasis on the possibility that his country might
have been, in the recent past, a bad host to the writer's memory. It
isn't now, of course, but the recent past refuses to lie down and
die, and for the less recent past, that goes double. Doomed to the
margins in an anti-Semitic culture, weren't the Jews oppressed even
before the Nazis got there? Wasn't Schulz a born victim?</TE>
<TE>   He probably was, but not in the historical sense. Frustratingly
missing in the area already noted, Ficowski's sense of history is
present and correct where it matters most: He sees the Drohobycz
shtetl of Schulz's childhood as a creative incubator and not just as
a trap. Drohobycz was in the old Galicia, so Schulz was born and
raised under the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Until the Russians moved in
and made it part of Ukraine, his hometown was part of a civilization.
For Jews, that civilization certainly had its difficulties, but the
coming nightmare kept nobody awake because it seemed unthinkable.
Jews had a future. Schulz's helpless fatalism has to be sought in his
personality, and it is too much to assume that his personality was
determined by his circumstances or else we would have to say that his
talent was too. The fatalism and the talent went together.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the fatalism was a counterproductive propensity to be a
good man at every moment, with never a thought for his own long-term
interests. The boy who was caught by his mother feeding flies so that
they would be safe for the winter grew to be the man who would give
all he had to a beggar. He gave everything of himself, as if there
were no tomorrow. (There wasn't, of course, but not even Adolf Hitler
was sure of that yet.) As an art teacher, he would enthrall his
pupils with his chalk-talk stories, caring for them far beyond the
demands of the job and consuming the time he might have spent on his
own art. He was consumed by the moment in the same way that his
attention was consumed by an object. It was a miracle that he got
anything at all drawn or written. He always needed someone else to
discover him because he had no energy left over with which to
discover himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Cinnamon Shops" began in his letters to a friend, Debora Vogel.
Without her, the book might never have happened. Women looked after
him because he so obviously needed to be mothered. In his artwork,
the dominatrix was omnipresent, and the figure most like him was
usually on its knees. (All the women were real: When he drew them
nude, their husbands recognized them and raised a ruckus.) His life
was like that. The trap was in his mind. To call him a Jewish
historic victim is to diminish him, the Jews and history itself,
which shrivels to a cartoon if read through hindsight, thereby
encouraging the hopeless notion that the Jews of Europe were born
only in order to die. But they were born in order to live: hence the
tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Even with his tremendous powers of hesitation, Schulz managed to
become a member of the Polish Academy of Letters. By the time of his
real entrapment, he was famous enough for other literary notables to
attempt a rescue. He might have gotten away, but typically he was
unable to face the choice. The choice might have come down to the
impossible decisions involved in packing a bag: socks first or a
spare sweater? He was like that. By giving us the man in all his
frailty, Ficowski has helped to explain the artist in all his
strength, but for the full measure of that strength we need to see
those brilliant little books.</TE>
<TE>   Theodosia Robertson promises us a new translation of them, done by
herself: Apparently the full etymological depth of the prose will be
brought out. Some excerpts from her work in progress can be read in
this volume. Since too much incorporated scholarship could only put
the text further out of reach, one is glad to note that the extracts
do not look very different from the same passages in Celina
Wieniewska's established renditions, most attractively available in
"The Collected Works of Bruno Schulz" that was published in London by
Picador in 1998. Recklessly lavish in its production standards, the
book cost a whopping 50 pounds sterling at the time, and it was a
commercial flop. I got my copy in a remainder shop for a pittance,
and no doubt it can be picked up reasonably cheaply on the Web.
Edited by Ficowski and prefaced by novelist David Grossman at his
most eloquent, it is a truly beautiful book, appropriate to its
subject in everything but its physical dimensions.</TE>
<TE>   Essentially a miniaturist writer, Schulz looks a bit lost in so
monumental a volume, but there is an upside: There is room to
reproduce his marvelous graphic work at its full value, and the book
would be worth having if only for its color reproduction of the
single easel painting we know exists. Painted in 1920, it is called
"Encounter: a young Jew and two women in an alley." From that one
page alone, you can see that Schulz had absorbed the whole tradition
of European painting and would undoubtedly have added to it if his
pictures had survived. Luckily the wave of history that rolled over
images found it harder to wipe out words, and Bruno Schulz the writer
is always with us. He is just a bit hard to get at. This biography
helps.</TE>

<HD>The unsung woman behind a Nobel Prize</HD>
<DH>Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA, Brenda Maddox,
HarperCollins: 400 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Margaret Wertheim</AU>
<BD>Margaret Wertheim is the author of "The Pearly Gates of
Cyberspace: A History of Space From Dante to the Internet."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The philosopher of science Evelyn Fox Keller once remarked that if a
woman scientist hopes to win a Nobel Prize, she had better plan on
living a very long time. Rosalind Franklin, unwisely, died at 37,
putting her out of the running when, four years later, her colleague
Maurice Wilkins, along with James Watson and Francis Crick, was
awarded a Nobel for discovering the structure of DNA. Franklin's
impeccable X-ray photographs provided the data on which Watson and
Crick built their ideas, and Franklin herself was already on track to
deciphering DNA. Few experts today doubt that her name also should be
on the Nobel roster.</LD>
<LD>   Her death, however, saved the Swedish Academy of Sciences from a
sticky situation, for Nobel rules stipulate that each award can be
shared by only three people. Franklin had a prickly relationship with
all three men, who coveted her data but viewed her as a
bluestockinged harridan. Moreover, as the only woman among the four,
her chances for a nomination were probably poor, even had she lived.
In the history of the Nobels, only 10 women have been honored with
one of the science prizes, of which there are three categories:
medicine or physiology, physics, and chemistry. Rosalind Franklin
would not have been the first to suffer from Nobel chauvinism.
Fortunately for the academy, she was dead, and so the problem never
arose.</LD>
<TE>   April 2003 marks the 50th anniversary of Watson and Crick's
momentous announcement that DNA is a tightly coiled helical ladder
whose rungs encode the language of life. Big celebrations are being
planned, and the three laureates will no doubt be lauded in style.
Though absent from the proceedings, I suspect that Franklin's spirit
will be much invoked by all parties, as eager to assuage their own
sense of guilt as to pay homage to this singular woman. Which is to
say that half a century and a feminist revolution later, Rosalind
Franklin is finally getting the recognition she deserves. Not the
least of her tributes, and surely not the last, is Brenda Maddox's
cannily timed biography.</TE>
<TE>   Happily for readers, Maddox eschews the hagiographic path. In her
opening pages, she notes that Franklin has often been presented as
"the Sylvia Plath of biology, the woman whose gifts were sacrificed
to the greater glory of the male." This mythologizing, though
"intended to be reparative," has, in Maddox's view, "done her no
favors." Here Maddox aims to set the record straight with an account
of a complex, determined and, yes, at times difficult woman.</TE>
<TE>   Like many women scientists of the early 20th century, Franklin
came from a Jewish family in which a love of learning was deeply
ingrained. Her father was a London banker, but several nights a week
he poured his own thwarted scientific interests into the Working
Man's College, where he taught classes in magnetism, electricity and
the history of the Great War. At the age of 12, Rosalind announced
her intention of becoming a scientist. Nonetheless, and it is
critical to understanding her, she always suffered from a sense that
in her parents' eyes, her brothers came first. Beneath her apparent
confidence, Rosalind Franklin was plagued by nagging self-doubt.</TE>
<TE>   In 1938, Franklin was accepted to Cambridge University after
topping the entrance examination in chemistry (she of course worried
that she'd failed). Cambridge had admitted women to its classes since
1869, and Jews since 1871, but in the 1930s, the university still did
not grant degrees to women. Like other female students of her day,
Franklin received hers years after she graduated. Trained in physics
and chemistry, she first made a name for herself as an expert on the
microstructure of coal. That led to an interest in the emerging field
of X-ray crystallography, at which she proved a dab hand, and in 1950
she was offered a job at Kings College in London to apply this
technique to DNA.</TE>
<TE>   So used are we to hearing about DNA's central role in the
chemistry of life that it is hard to imagine this understanding was
ever in doubt. But in the early '50s, many scientists thought
proteins were the crucial molecules. Deoxyribonucleic acid was
clearly important -- there were masses of the stuff in every cell
nucleus -- but what did it do? One of the more radical concepts
evolving at the time was the idea that the structure of an organic
molecule might in some way determine its function. If scientists
could work out the structure of DNA, perhaps they would gain an
insight into what purpose it served. In the biophysics department at
Kings College, J.T. Randall, an eminent physicist and British war
hero, decided that DNA's structure was a problem worth solving, and
he hired Franklin to do the job.</TE>
<TE>   During the 27 months Franklin spent at Kings, she focused her
attention on DNA, honing her crystallography skills to produce the
clearest and most precise X-ray diffraction images of the enigmatic
molecule. Unlike regular photography, which shows us the shape of the
object itself, X-ray diffraction reveals the pattern of rays
scattered by the object. From this pattern, the shape of the actual
object must then be deduced. In Franklin's now-famous Photo 51 was
clear evidence for DNA's helical structure.</TE>
<TE>   "The instant I saw the picture, my mouth fell open and my pulse
began to race," James Watson later wrote in "The Double Helix," his
own saucy account of his and Crick's discovery, published in 1968.
Many people already suspected that DNA had a helical form, but
Franklin's images provided the solid data from which the precise
structure could be determined. The most important question was how
many helical strands might be involved. Watson and Crick had
initially proposed a three-stranded model, as did Linus Pauling,
another Nobel laureate. Using Franklin's data, which had been
surreptitiously given to them by her colleague Maurice Wilkins,
Watson and Crick were at last able to piece together the correct
two-stranded model.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Watson and Crick realized that this elegant double
spiral suggested in its structure a copying mechanism for genetic
material. As the two helixes unzip, each becomes a template for
another copy. Function was indeed encoded in form. For this step
alone, Watson and Crick justly deserve the accolades they received.
But without Franklin's data, as Watson himself has admitted, they
would not have been able to get there.</TE>
<TE>   But a question lingers: Why didn't Franklin take the theoretical
initiative? Why didn't she discern the double helix model herself?
Maddox's poignant and pithy biography might be seen as an attempt to
get to the heart of this conundrum, and here I think she does justice
to her subject as only the best biographers can.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin was trained to be cautious. Everything in her personality
and upbringing rebelled against what Maddox incisively terms "an
outrageous leap of the imagination." It is clear that Franklin did
recognize in her data the potential for a helical structure, yet she
believed that a scientist should not act on intuition and insisted on
amassing all the facts before making any public avowal. James Watson,
on the other hand, was all outrageous imagination. Certain of his own
genius, Watson was convinced that whoever discovered the structure of
DNA would write his (or her) name in history, and he wasn't about to
sit around and wait to be scooped. He trusted his intuition
implicitly.</TE>
<TE>   The differences between Franklin and Watson -- the former
meticulous and cautious, painstakingly gathering data to build up an
unimpeachable case; the latter rushing headlong into wild speculation
-- define two poles of the scientific character. For much of history,
the former qualities were revered as the ideal, but during the 20th
century, the latter came to the fore. In that sense, Rosalind
Franklin was definitively the old-fashioned type. Maddox's book,
though ostensibly a biography of an individual, is an exploration of
the changing nature of science itself and, above all, of what is
required for success in the field. In Watson's bull-at-a-gate style,
we can see the template for a more recent scientific achievement, the
sequencing of the human genome. Here the go-getter was maverick
geneticist J. Craig Venter, who by sheer force of ego pushed the
project to resolution years ahead of schedule. Expect his name on a
Nobel medal some time soon.</TE>
<TE>   Next April, Watson and Crick and Wilkins will stand on podiums
around the globe and the world will rightly cheer their achievement.
Franklin, whom Watson so dismissively caricatured in "The Double
Helix," will not be there to share the limelight. At the peak of her
career, having already made significant contributions to three
separate fields of science, she died of ovarian cancer, very likely
induced by overexposure to x-rays in the course of her research. The
true tragedy here, as Maddox notes in her final pages, is not the
absence of a Nobel but the premature termination of a brilliant
career: "The lost prize was life."</TE>

Dreamers, Carolyn See,  Random House: 288 pp., $23.95</DH>

<AU>Sven Birkerts</AU>
<BD>Sven Birkerts is the author of five books of essays
and the recent memoir, "My Sky Blue Trades."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Posthumous gatherings of previously uncollected pieces all too often
comprise outtakes, lectures and ephemeral prose that an author might
not have intended for posterity. Thus, one feels a certain skepticism
about the Modern Library's decision to collect seven essays of Eudora
Welty. At first encounter, "On Writing" appeared to be pitched at
topics of somewhat narrow writerly interest, suggesting that they
were meant as reflections on craft for the interested student and
practitioner, as opposed to a broader readership. This was clearly
not a book in the deeper sense, not a coherent intended whole, its
parts resonating purposefully. A quarter century separated the
writing of the first piece and the last; tone and approach were not
uniform; there was no core concept or bias on which to hang the main
points that Welty was making. Taken together, the essays disclosed a
sensibility bound to specifics far more than to a sustained overview.</LD>
<TE>   A second reading, however, overrides one's reservations. Sentence
by sentence, insight by insight, Welty's inspired literary
intelligence shines. These are not, it's true, essays likely to
interest the lay reader. But they are not just shoptalk either. They
are written to be read by the person who has given serious thought to
the philosophical as well as practical questions that attend the
writing of fiction. To that receptive intelligence, they offer
insights about the inner process of writing that feel almost
confidential. Reading, taking in these views and vistas at a walking
pace -- for there is no rushing, ever, with Welty's prose -- we
encounter once again the intuitive sensibility, the instructed heart
and the truth-risking edge that have made Welty arguably the finest
20th century American short-story writer.</TE>
<TE>   Welty, who died last year at 92, was, at her core, in her fiction
as well as her burnished memoir, "One Writer's Beginnings," a
Pascalian, promoting the heart's reasons over those of reason itself.
She looked at fiction -- her own and the work of her fellow
practitioners (everyone from Flaubert to D.H. Lawrence to Elizabeth
Bowen to William Faulkner) -- always as a living expression of spirit
that is not amenable to dissection.</TE>
<TE>   In the essay "Writing and Analyzing a Story," she comes as close
to stating a credo as is possible for a writer of her temperament. "I
would rather submit a story to the test of its outside world," she
writes, "to show what it was doing and how it went about it, than to
the method of critical analysis which would pick the story up by its
heels (as if it had swallowed a button) to examine the writing
process as analysis in reverse, as though any story -- or any system
of feeling -- could be more accessible to understanding for being
hung upside down."</TE>
<TE>   The button is a beautiful touch, as is the image of hanging the
work by its heels. Indeed, the trace of Welty's shape-making
imagination, her delight in bringing ideas to larger life, is
everywhere to be seen. Taking up the central (for Welty especially)
issue of place in fiction, she telegraphs her engagement from the
very start: "Place is one of the lesser angels that watch over the
racing hand of fiction, perhaps the one that gazes benignly enough
from off to one side, while others, like character, plot, symbolic
meaning, and so on, are doing a good deal of wing-beating about her
chair, and feeling, who in my eyes carries the crown, soars highest
of them all and rightly relegates place into the shade."</TE>
<TE>   I will be pardoned for using this small billboard space mainly to
promote the excellence -- the incandescent precision -- of Welty's
prose. The reviewer, inspired, is but a shill for the attractions of
a given book. And in this book they are so obviously those of charged
figurative language in the service of elusive yet essential insights.
In the essay, "Place in Fiction," to take another instance, Welty
links setting to point of view and condenses her conclusion to
bouillon-cube density: "Conscientiously used, point of view will
discover, explore, see through -- it may sometimes divine and
prophesy. Misused, it turns opaque almost at once and gets in the way
of the book. And when the good novel is finished, its cooled outside
shape ... has all the burden of communicating that initial,
spontaneous, overwhelming, driving charge of personal inner feeling
that was the novel's reason for being. The measure of this
representation of life corresponds most tellingly with the novel's
life expectancy: whenever its world of outside appearance grows dim
or false to the eye, the novel has expired."</TE>
<TE>   We are brought back, again and again in these pieces, to a
grateful recognition of Welty's bedrock certainty: that the universal
nestles, always, in the radiant particular. As she writes, "The open
mind and the receptive heart -- which are at last and with fortune's
smile the informed mind and the experienced heart -- are to be gained
anywhere, any time, without necessarily moving an inch from any
present address."</TE>
<TE>   If Welty represents creative inspiration in its purest integrity,
then Carolyn See, in "Making a Literary Life: Advice for Writers and
Other Dreamers," brings the writer out of contemplative solitude and
into the marketplace. Here is a pep talk, a revved-up compendium of
suggestions and tricks (as if there could be any tricks that are not
at the very same time truthful insights) meant to help the
practitioner find success in what is all too often a discouraging
literary world.</TE>
<TE>   "In the privacy of your own home," urges See, "or with people you
absolutely love and trust -- why not make some treasure maps? Draw
pictures of what you want and need in this literary life of yours. If
you're working on a book, what's the title? Write it out nicely, on a
good sheet of paper. Be sure to put your name on as author."</TE>
<TE>   The passage is representative, but I'll resist the temptation to
make light of it. If See helps any would-be writer through the dark
wood of composition, she will have performed a service. But no, I
just wrote a lie. There is no help through the dark wood of
composition, not for anyone. At best these games and strategies will
divert the writer briefly from the taxing matter at hand. But so will
cooking, hiking, bowling or pulling the frayed threads from the end
of an old blanket.</TE>
<TE>   After the faith and dignity implicit in every sentence of Welty's
book, it is hard to see the point of all this fussing and fidgeting.
"Quick, now, a short list of the other kind of 'important' people you
knew, and why. The ones who give you the willies. Who creep you out
and you don't know why."</TE>
<TE>   What's to say? Read in tandem these two short books remind us of
the gulf -- the chasm -- that has always existed between the serious
making of art and what might be called the sphere of commerce.</TE>

<DH>Early Occult Memory Systems of the Lower Midwest, B.H.
Fairchild, W.W. Norton: 126 pp., $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Muske-Dukes</AU>
<BD>Carol Muske Dukes is a contributing writer to Book
Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Art of the Lathe" by B.H. Fairchild has become a contemporary
classic -- a passionate example of the plain style, so finely crafted
and perfectly pitched that it both called to mind the voices of its
predecessors in style: James Wright, Richard Hugo and Philip Levine
(not to mention Whitman) and further refreshed the image of the poet
as working-class hero. Those poems -- workhorse narratives suffused
with tenderness and elegiac music -- sang of the dying vocations of
hands-on ironworkers, masons, lathe operators and the unabashed raw
grace of their labor.</LD>
<TE>   That book paved the way for the broader, more plangent poems of
Fairchild's new (fourth) collection, "Early Occult Memory Systems of
the Lower Midwest," which continues to excavate the familiar,
profound and desolate territory of the earlier book. The book's
epigraph is from James Agee's "A Death in the Family," and it should
be noted that one poem, "The Welder, Visited by the Angel of Mercy,"
is reprinted from "The Art of the Lathe," because, as the author
says, the present book in a sense "grew out of" that poem. These are
the poems drawn straight from the memory of the worker's son, the
dreaming boy steeped in a sense of place but haunted by the
"displacement" of remembering and imagining what is disappearing
before him. He is haunted too by the memories and unforgettable
anecdotes of his parents, neighbors -- of failed baseball players,
priests, storytellers, roustabouts.</TE>
<TE>   The Lost Cause, the Lost Moment, the Perfect Escape are celebrated
in poem after poem (including the failed life of the American Indian
pitcher who strikes out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in "nine straight
heaters," then blows his career). The poems' titles, such as "The
Decline of Utopian Ideas in the West," "The Blue Buick: a Narrative,"
"The Second Annual 'Wizard of Oz' Reunion in Liberal, Kansas," all
testify to the demise of Fairchild's despairing dreams and dreamers
-- extending further into the author's mature wanderings. "The Memory
Palace" weaves lines of the Agee epigraph through its own
meditations:</TE>
<TE>   Out back in the welding shop where men were gods, Vulcans in black
helmets, and the blaze of cutting torches hurled onto the ceiling the
gigantic shadows you watched as a child, place here the things of
gods and children: baseball; a twilight double-header and the blue
bowl of the sky as the lights come on....</TE>
<TE>   Fairchild beautifully translates an epigraph taken from Blaise
Cendrars' "The Subdividing of the Sky" and connects Cendrars to other
themes, including the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. His
inspirations in mapping memory range from St. Augustine to
Heraclitus:</TE>
<TE>   How in Heraclitus</TE>
<TE>   ideas of things, quality, and event</TE>
<TE>   coalesce -- sun/warmth/</TE>
<TE>   dawn --</TE>
<TE>   the perceiver/perceived, too,</TE>
<TE>   not yet parsed, not yet,</TE>
<TE>   and then the great Forgetting...</TE>

<TE>   The Blind Stitch</TE>
<TE>   Greg Delanty</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana State University Press:</TE>
<TE>   64 pp., $22.95</TE>
<TE>   A quick nod to "The Blind Stitch," an engaging new volume from
Irish poet Greg Delanty. His voice is characterized by the heavily
inflected, heady music of his mother tongue and a "Hopkins at home"
feel. Its many beauties include the delightful, child's rhyme-ish,
domestic lyric of the title poem:</TE>
<TE>   ... I have the eye</TE>
<TE>   haven't I, the knack?</TE>
<TE>   I'm Prince Threader. I missed it that try.</TE>
<TE>   Concentrate. Concentrate. Enough yackety yak.</TE>

<HD>Rice sharpens her gothic bite</HD>
<DH>Blackwood Farm: The Vampire Chronicles, Anne Rice Alfred A.
Knopf: 534 pp., $26.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Harris</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first chapter of Anne Rice's latest novel, 22-year-old Tarquin
"Quinn" Blackwood, a newly made vampire, writes a revealing letter to
the Vampire Lestat, who has banned other blood drinkers from New
Orleans. Quinn needs help and seeks Lestat's advice. The letter is
revealing because Quinn knows where to leave it: at Lestat's flat on
the Rue Royale. Indeed, he knows a great deal about vampires. How?
Because, like millions of us, he has read "The Vampire Chronicles,"
which we assume are fictions by Rice but which he knows are true
stories, many written by Lestat himself.</LD>
<LD>   It's a sign of how the vampire story has changed since Bram Stoker
started the genre a century ago with "Dracula." His vampire was a
singular, foreign menace. Rice's vampires, witches and ghosts are
just another large, eccentric Southern family, at home with one
another and separated from the rest of us by the thinnest of
barriers.</LD>
<LD>   Quinn's own family is peculiar, to say the least. In the 1880s,
Manfred Blackwood cleared a farm and built a mansion on the edge of
Sugar Devil Swamp in northern Louisiana. Then he disappeared,
allegedly with the blood of several women on his hands. Quinn
explores the swamp and finds Manfred's hideaway, with rusty chains,
human bones and a mysterious gold-paneled tomb.</LD>
<TE>   Even as a child, Quinn can see ghosts, and Blackwood Farm swarms
with them. In particular, Quinn has a double, an ectoplasmic twin
named Goblin, who follows him everywhere. Sometimes loving, sometimes
mischievous, Goblin is as real to Quinn as his beloved Aunt Queen or
any of the tutors or laborers on the property.</TE>
<TE>   Having Goblin around makes it hard for Quinn to fit in with
society outside the farm. A second supernatural relationship -- with
Rebecca, the ghost of one of Manfred's murdered mistresses -- lures
him into the swamp and puts him within a vampire's striking range.</TE>
<TE>   Once the "Dark Trick" is worked on Quinn, his hopes of marriage to
Mona Mayfair -- one of Rice's Mayfair witches -- are destroyed. Worst
of all, Goblin grows stronger, stealing some of the blood Quinn sucks
from his victims, threatening to kill on his own..</TE>
<TE>   Goblin has to be stopped, maybe even destroyed. And only Lestat,
with his centuries of experience in the realm of the undead, might
know how to do that. So Quinn -- who has never taken the easy way out
-- bravely tracks Lestat down.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn is the main reason "Blackwood Farm" is a livelier read than
Rice's last novel, "Blood and Gold." As narrator, he brings a boyish
charm, even humor.</TE>
<TE>   A Rice plot sprawls like kudzu, and there's room in this one for
19th century Naples and a hermaphrodite gladiator from ancient Rome.
Still, "Blackwood Farm" hews to the oral storytelling tradition of
the South: people sitting on a porch, swapping yarns about their
family -- the odder the family, the better.</TE>

<HD>Can only a Cuban write about Cuba?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How does one begin to respond to Carlos Eire's review of my book
"Cuba Confidential: Love and Vengeance in Miami and Havana," a
misinformed polemic that seamlessly demonstrates the central argument
of my book? Eire's contention that Cuban loss and suffering is so
unique, so special, that only Cubans should write about the subject
is, well, preposterous -- and unacceptable.</LD>
<LD>   Eire's blindness leads him to a willful misreading of my book. He
posits several arguments based on statements that he claims to have
read in my book, but these statements or sentiments are not to be
found in my book. For example, Eire states that the premise of my
book is that "the Cuban Revolution should be seen as a family feud,"
when what I wrote was that the subsequent 43-year-old standoff "has
proven so intractable, so immune to resolution" because "in part,
with no diminishment intended, it is a huge family feud filled with
the corresponding heartbreak, rancor and bitterness."</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, it was my hope that the metaphor of the shattered family
would humanize the exile struggle during the post-Elian period when
exiles have been, at times, demonized. Nevertheless, only the first
two chapters specifically reference the broken Cuban family; the next
10 chapters deal with the political and ideological factions of the
Cuban Revolution and those that exist today within the diaspora, in
Cuba and in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   Eire also mistakenly claims that I wrote that "being subjected to
the Pedro Pan exodus counts as a privilege." This is a fabrication.
The book variously described the Pedro Pan airlift as a "painful
experience" and "a wrenching estrangement" for the children it sought
"to save from being raised in a communist country." My book quotes
Nelson Valdes, an exile historian, who like Eire endured the Pedro
Pan airlift, as enumerating some of the benefits particular to Cuban
exiles. However, Valdes does not suggest that being uprooted from
one's family was one of them. Curiously, Eire entirely ignores the
comments of Valdes and other Pedro Pans quoted in my book -- perhaps
because their belief that Elian Gonzalez should have been reunited
with his father is inconveniently at odds with his strongly felt
views.</TE>
<TE>   While my book goes to pains to document the repressive and
suffocating nature of Cuban life under Fidel Castro, along with the
stunning achievements of Cuban Americans ("and the breadth of their
successes"), it also points out that Cuban exiles are the most
privileged immigrants ever to come to the U.S. Indeed, exiles have
even successfully crafted an immigration policy that favors them over
all other immigrants. Eire views these facts as prejudicial but
offers nothing to dispute them.</TE>
<TE>   A more grievous error is Eire's claim that my book contends that
repression and fear in Miami were "perhaps more profound" than that
in Cuba when in fact, I have gone to considerable lengths to
distinguish between state-sponsored repression and that generated by
a community. My point, which Eire contorts himself to duck at all
times, is that the erosion of free expression and democratic ideals
in exile Miami has been considerable and worthy of our attention.</TE>
<TE>   While Eire asks that attention be paid to his own traumatic story,
he is keen to dismiss the sufferings of Cubans who disagree with his
convictions. Focusing his criticism on me as an uncomprehending
"outsider," he simply ignores the fact that my book is entirely
sourced by Cubans -- an estimated 300 interviews from both sides of
the Florida Straits. And while his narrative oozes with postured
condescension and sarcasm, he produces no documentation to dispute
anything in my book.</TE>
<TE>   What informs every line of Eire's writing is his disappointment in
reading a book that does not address his personal saga as a Pedro Pan
refugee. Certainly, this is worthy material, but it is not the basis
of this book. Woefully, Eire's review informs the reader about his
own story but very little about my book.</TE>
<TE>   Eire struggles to make the case that I am an insensitive clinician
probing at the wound of the Cuban soul. But never could I have
endured these 10 years in the war zone of the Cuban debate without a
nagging, ceaseless empathy for the tragedy of the Cuban people.</TE>

<TE>   I am appalled that the reviewer chosen to comment on "Cuba
Confidential" by Ann Louise Bardach is himself a Cuban emigre and one
whose life was shattered, by his own admission, when his parents sent
him off to the United States alone and unprotected in the early '60s.
How anyone could expect an unbiased view from a person with such a
history is beyond me.</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Spiva</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Eire's review of Ann Louise Bardach's "Cuba Confidential"
is really a polemic dressed up as a book review. As a Cuban American
whose parents left with me in 1961, and who was raised in Miami, I
read Bardach's book as a needed exploration of the conflict that
plagues Cuba. Eire casts himself as speaking for Cuban exiles, but
his observations on Cuba and the diaspora do not speak to me. His
criticism of Bardach as an "outsider" ineligible to write about us
because she is not Cuban herself is patently preposterous. In fact,
what makes the Cuban situation so intractable is that both camps of
Cubans have cast each other as the "outsider."</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If, as Carlos Eire argues in his review of Ann Louise Bardach's
"Cuba Confidential," only a Cuban can understand another Cuban, why
then have they been so incapable of reaching an understanding? Or
could it be that an outsider's perspective, such as the one Bardach
brings to the subject, is what exiles and Fidelistas so sorely need?</TE>
<TE>   Rex Weiner</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a Cuban-American, born in Cuba and raised in Miami, I feel
compelled to say that Eire does not speak for all Cubans. There are
those of us that are trying to dig through the emotional soap opera
of half-truths and hyperbole that reverberate from both of the
Havanas, in an attempt to understand the realities of the situation.
Bardach's book is a resource (written as only an "outsider" can) that
has helped me to do just that.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I commend The Times for publishing Carlos Eire's review. Finally
someone speaks for me when it comes to an apologist of a dictator
that has been in power for 43 years. Being a Pedro Pan myself, I left
Cuba at 13 and did not see my mother for a year and a half and my
father for four and a half years. My parents had a bigger love to
have their children grow and live in freedom than any love they had
for themselves.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For a reader who has grown accustomed for more than 40 years to
hearing only one side of the story of the ongoing Cuban crisis,
Carlos Eire's response to Ann Louise Bardach's "Cuba Confidential"
was a puff of fresh air. Eire writes as a Cuban-American who has
endured the suffering not only of the Pedro Pan saga but the very
strange spins that outside parties have put on the matter since then.
Reasonable people can and should have different opinions on the
so-called Cuban feud. So what's wrong with hearing, if only once in a
while, the other side of the story, that is, the way that Cubans
themselves perceive their own suffering, or a critique of the
paternalistic takes that Anglos place upon our history?</TE>
<TE>   The problem with Bardach's superimposition of a soap opera script
upon the entire Cuban debate is that it obscures attention on
legitimate civic issues concerning historical accuracy and human
rights and displaces it toward the petty incidents of human foibles,
which are not, let's remind ourselves, the exclusive province of
Cubans or Cuban-Americans.</TE>

<TE>   Lexington, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ann Louise Bardach has a farfetched theme: that Fidel Castro's
Cuba is a soap opera. I don't know Carlos Eire, but his review is a
serious rebuttal of the kind of political tourists who have made a
profession out of Cuba and her suffering under a totalitarian regime.
Their plight is not a soap but a tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo Cabrera Infante</TE>
<TE>   London</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Eire replies:</TE>
<TE>   Odd that I am accused of intolerance or ill-will simply because I
raised questions about spin and reductionism and criticized the
author's approach. I did not dispute the facts of Bardach's book. Nor
did I disparage her research. I praised her for being thorough and
meticulous. I lauded her professionalism and her ability to make
contacts on opposite sides of the fray. Nowhere did I suggest that
only Cubans should write about Cuba or, even less, that I spoke for
all Cubans. I raised the question of the insider-outsider dialectic
because I am sensitive to it as a historian of late medieval and
early modern Europe. In my own work, I am always an outsider.</TE>
<TE>   What I wrote was a spirited appraisal of an engaging book that is,
sadly, blinkered by its methodology and the coarse reductive approach
of its author. That approach favors the personal and psychological
over the political and ideological. At times, it also blurs the line
between fact and opinion. It's helpful, but only up to a point. That
Bardach feels the pain of the Cuban predicament is inarguable,
perhaps even admirable. I only wonder if she doesn't feel it too
intensely.</TE>

<LD>"Foreigners aren't always right about America, far from it. But
neither are they merely embittered fanatics, or jealous of our money,
or resentful of our power, or animated by any of the other stock
explanations mainstream American pundits and politicians have
advanced as substitutes for honest self-examination." Honest
self-examination is what Mark Hertsgaard, a freelance journalist and
author, sets out to accomplish in "The Eagle's Shadow," a thoughtful
book based on his travels, conversations, interviews and
eavesdropping around the world.</LD>
<LD>   Hertsgaard explores 10 impressions of America. Four are positive:
America is the future, for example; America is the land of freedom.
Six are negative: America is parochial and self-centered; Americans
are philistines, to name two.</LD>
<LD>   Hertsgaard is young enough to believe that we can change -- that
we must change -- by understanding how we are perceived and by not
being so threatened by criticism. "We need a revolution in America,"
he writes toward the end. "Not one of violence and disorder, but one
of values and ways of thinking, one that remembers where we came
from."</LD>
<TE>   In spite of this statement, blurted like a confession, Hertsgaard
has a light hand with political analysis that is extremely
refreshing. He doesn't pretend to be authoritative, like so many news
analysts, about cultures he knows little about, and he doesn't need
to tell us that he "loves America." He wouldn't have written the book
if he didn't.</TE>

<TE>   War Plan Iraq: Ten Reasons Against War on Iraq</TE>
<TE>   Milan Rai, Verso: 240 pp., $15 paper</TE>
<TE>   "War Plan Iraq" is one of those books you read to explore in
greater depth events that dominate the front pages of newspapers
around the world. You go into it knowing that a balanced perspective
is not what you paid for. Instead, it is a thorough explanation of
one side of the argument, in this case based a bit too much on
newspaper articles but useful nonetheless for its framework. Milan
Rai is a founding member of a British antiwar organization called
ARROW (Active Resistance to the Roots of War) and Voices in the
Wilderness, an organization campaigning to end the United
Nations-imposed economic sanctions on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Illustrated with photos of Iraqi children and woodcuts of Iraqi
life, "War Plan Iraq" is organized around 10 reasons not to go to
war. They are: lack of evidence; lack of links between Iraq and Sept.
11; "this is not a war for democracy"; the possibility of
humanitarian disaster; possible demolition of Iraqi Kurdistan;
illegality; opposition from Iraq's neighbors; "generals on both sides
of the Atlantic oppose the war"; "a majority of people in Britain
oppose the war"; and "a war on Iraq could trigger a world recession."</TE>

<TE>   Homefront: A Military City and the American 20th Century,
Catherine Lutz, Beacon Press: 328 pp., $20 paper</TE>
<TE>   "How did it come to be that we live in a society made by war and
preparations for war?" asks urban anthropologist Catherine Lutz in
her fascinating study of Fayetteville, N.C., population 100,000
(one-quarter of them veterans), home of Ft. Bragg. We often hear
about the positive economic effects of war preparations (a fact Lutz
disputes) but very little about the cultural and social effects.</TE>
<TE>   Fayetteville has the smallest tax base, the lowest voter
registration and the highest poverty, child abuse, auto accidents and
female unemployment per capita in North Carolina. Chain link fences,
drugs, prostitution, segregation and the Klan make it an increasingly
unpopular town for businesses and homeowners alike.</TE>
<TE>   The line between military and civilian in this country is not as
sharp as we'd like to believe, Lutz argues. "What would America look
like today if the elites who opt for war had made other choices?"</TE>

<HD>Spielberg decides it's time to have some serious fun</HD>
<DH>For years, the Oscar-winning director has poured his
passion into such socially incisive projects as 'Schindler's List,'
'Amistad' and 'Minority Report.' Then along comes 'Catch Me if You
Can,' a lighthearted tale that romps through innocence, larceny and
human fallibility. Why? 'I needed this,' he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>Standing in front of a Pasadena house festooned with lights right out
of Christmas 1963, Steven Spielberg is amused to find himself in a
universe far, far away from his usual extravaganzas of the
dinosaur/World War II/futuristic robot variety. In this safe, homey
world, there are no blue screens, flying henchman, scientific
wizardry or multiple whirling cameras.</LD>
<LD>   For Spielberg, "Catch Me if You Can," the tragicomic tale of a
teenage con man, is a lark, a welcome respite from his weighty films
of the last decade. As the director puts it: "I needed this. It sort
of came along and rescued me."</LD>
<LD>   The film explores lighthearted larceny on a human scale; in one of
the rare instances since "Sugarland Express," Spielberg's first film,
human foibles drive the story.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, the life it's based on -- that of Frank Abagnale Jr.
(Leonardo DiCaprio) -- is not pedestrian, but big-screen-sized. As a
teenager on the lam from his parent's divorce, Abagnale successfully
impersonated a pediatrician at a Georgia hospital, a state attorney
and a raft of airline pilots, impressively running scams and bouncing
checks all over the world for millions of dollars. He is pursued
around the world by a relentless modern-day Javert, an FBI agent
played by Oscar winner Tom Hanks. Abagnale also romanced a veritable
platoon of beauties, most with no idea that their suave Romeo was but
a kid, several years their junior. "Leo kisses a lot of girls," says
the director, noting what undoubtedly will be one of the film's
selling points when it opens Christmas Day.</TE>
<TE>   The film is an ode to the innocence of the '60s, an evocation of
an earlier America, when pillbox-hatted stewardesses were chic and
men wore dark-rimmed glasses and buzz cuts. A misdirected teenager
running scams with the insouciant charm of young Cary Grant seems
positively benign in a world of Columbine and snipers. Spielberg
particularly likes the tale's improbable but true (and morally
satisfying) finale: Abagnale is now one of the country's leading
experts on fraud, working extensively with Fortune 500 companies and
the FBI, the same agency that spent years hunting him down.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, it's a case of one shape-shifting boy wonder turning
the limelight on another. For Spielberg, 55, it's also a vehicle for
some of his fastest and dirtiest movie-making ever. It's hardly
guerrilla-style -- everything whirs with the smooth efficiency of a
top-of-the-line BMW -- but it does proceed at a blistering pace, 38
locations in the U.S. and Canada in 55 days.</TE>
<TE>   With its frisky tone and waggish lead, the $55-million "Catch Me
if You Can" certainly is lighter than his recent material, though not
"Indiana Jones 4," which he's also preparing. "I'm just at a point in
my life right now where I just want to react to things I'm interested
in, as opposed to trying to be somebody who I used to be to people
who would like me to go back," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the Spielberg-ologists make of the movie, the director
seems to be having fun. "This is like 'Playhouse 90.' It's like live
TV," he says, enthusiastic about his dive into raw, human-sized
filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   In Pasadena this past spring, Spielberg is mostly entranced with
watching an ethereal, dark-eyed, 5-year-old moppet in pink footie
pajamas. "Such a great face, a great face," he says with admiration.</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg has not only borrowed Steven Soderbergh's casting
director (Debra Zane) but also the Coen brothers' costume designer,
Mary Zophres, who gives the movie a look of bright-eyed buoyancy, a
self-conscious wittiness about the wholesomeness of the '60s. It's
hard not to giggle seeing DiCaprio, decked out in a baby-blue shorts
jumpsuit or a Creamsicle-hued sports get-up, though he maintains
enough clean-cut sexual panache to carry it off.</TE>
<TE>   In this scene, DiCaprio's genial swagger has caved in. He looks
haggard and scared, his skin the color of dishwater, his hair lank,
his clothes shabby. The FBI is on his tail, and he's returned to his
mother's house to confront her about her failed marriage to his
father.</TE>
<TE>   DiCaprio is knocking on the window trying to get his half-sister
-- who doesn't know him -- to open the door. The camera pans over his
shoulder, lingering on the warmth within the house as a stark
contrast to the cold outside, his sister enjoying the glow of a
security and love that's been ripped away from him.</TE>
<TE>   "Not your face, just your cheek and nose," Spielberg reminds
DiCaprio, before telling the camera crew, "Don't cut. Just keep
rolling." It's a strategy often employed by directors to keep energy
flowing.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can just make faces at her," suggests DiCaprio, and tries
unsuccessfully to get a rise out of the little girl, who watches him
with wide-eyed wonder, all the while holding a harmonica. "Tell her
to laugh a little here."</TE>
<TE>   "Let her do what she wants," Spielberg says. "It might be
surprising."</TE>
<TE>   In successive takes, the little girl grows more and more
responsive. When DiCaprio taps at the window, she shyly taps back,
and then begins to mouth her harmonica.</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg is pleased and effusive, and walks over to lead the girl
through the next part of the scene by the hand. "That was fantastic,
great."</TE>
<TE>   He knows the score</TE>
<TE>   Five months later, after a long summer sojourn in East Hampton,
Spielberg is scoring the film, watching as composer-conductor John
Williams, with whom he's worked longer than any other collaborator,
leads a 100-piece orchestra in a soundstage on the Sony lot.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, Williams sits down and plays the movie's main motifs on
the piano for Spielberg before orchestration, but the two were on
different coasts this past summer, and these recording sessions are
the first time Spielberg has heard the music. "I have implicit
trust."</TE>
<TE>   Wallowing in the majestic swell of violins and trumpets, he adds
giddily, "This is why I make movies."</TE>
<TE>   He watches the session with a tiny Sony digital camera affixed to
his eye. For the last 30 years, he's personally recorded Williams
conducting the score to every one of his movies. He practically
imbibes the music through the lens, panning from oboist to cellist to
trumpeter. The musicians are playing a jazzy score, with echoes of
Leonard Bernstein.</TE>
<TE>   In a break, Spielberg dives into a small antechamber to show a
visitor the first trailer, a jaunty Pink Panther-ish look at Tom
Hanks chasing a dapper DiCaprio across America.</TE>
<TE>   In the film, written by Jeff Nathanson (who also wrote "Rush Hour
2"), Abagnale's story has been tweaked and massaged into a three-part
structure, a taut tale of cat and mouse, with significant thrust
given to Hanks' character, who's not simply his tormentor but his
possible savior.</TE>
<TE>   According to one associate, Spielberg, when approaching a film,
often becomes enamored with a subject -- the Holocaust, for example
-- and then searches for an appropriate script. But this project,
developed by DreamWorks, dropped in his lap, with DiCaprio attached,
after having passed through several other directors, including Gore
Verbinski and Lasse Hallstrom.</TE>
<TE>   When pushed to actually commit, Spielberg hesitated.</TE>
<TE>   He was on vacation, so he called together his wife and daughter
and their various friends for an impromptu reading. "Seven girls and
myself sitting around the table and they all read the script out loud
to me," Spielberg recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "I related to it on the basis of the kind of larceny I had as a
kid, sneaking onto the Universal lot when I was 16 years old and
getting away with it."</TE>
<TE>   Abagnale "is a kid who continually reinvents himself," says
producer Walter Parkes, who also runs DreamWorks' production
division. "Steven is someone who reinvents himself from genre to
genre and is constantly playing different roles. We all kind of feel
like an impostor and we're waiting for someone to blow the whistle."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, while most of his directing counterparts from the '70s
have settled into familiar styles and obsessions, recycled through
most of their films, Spielberg -- like Abagnale -- has ardently
resisted getting trapped.</TE>
<TE>   One hallmark of Spielberg's films, though, is the fractured
family; his parents split when he was a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a subject that Spielberg discusses much, unless
specifically asked. "I certainly think I've been mopping up after my
parents' divorce for probably about 39 years," he says musingly. "I'm
fine with it. I've never thought much about it, although I have been
attracted to projects with themes of family dissolution. I just don't
know ... to be honest and humble. It might be the loudest
vocalization of my parents' divorce, but that's not really the reason
I made the movie."</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg says he simply wanted to make the kind of lighthearted
movies he used to watch at the drive-ins growing up in Phoenix in the
'60s. His parents would drive, while he and his date would be safely
ensconced in the back seat, often with a huge speaker strategically
placed between them. "There's nothing worse than having a date with
my mom and my dad behind the wheel," the director says and sighs 40
years later.</TE>
<TE>   Innocence was in the car, and unspooling across the screen was a
vision of America populated by beach blanket bingo and bang-bang
westerns.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess there's a component in my brain that is a little bit
retro," he admits. "So 'Catch Me if You Can' was an easy film for me
to make compared to 'Minority Report.' I had to rewire my brain to
make 'Minority Report,' whereas I didn't have to rewire anything to
make this.</TE>
<TE>   "When you meet [Frank], you suddenly see how it's so easy to trust
him," he adds. "He was a 21st century kid operating on 1960s
Americans. What he got away with was due to the fact he was operating
in a time of innocence. The music was all top-line melody and jazz
and bubblegum mixed, and the times were about to change with the
invention of the Beatles. He admits to me that he couldn't get away
with it today."</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg sounds relieved to be emerging from almost a decade of
darkness, of thinking about Jews being sent off to crematoriums, the
dehumanizing African slave trade, the brutalities of WWII and robots
in existential crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "I need the light in my life. After all those dark movies one
after the other, this was kind of a ray of sunshine and I wanted to
bask in it for a while before deciding what I do next," he says. "I
love this mood. It really pulled me out of my little dark place after
'Minority Report' and 'A.I.' and with 'Schindler's List' and
'Amistad.' "</TE>
<TE>   Relaxed, but always thinking</TE>
<TE>   Back in the house in Pasadena, Spielberg watches most of the
filming from behind a pair of video monitors set up in an adjoining
dining room cramped with extraneous furniture and a whole peanut
gallery of visitors. They include the house's owners, the little
girl's mother and DiCaprio's grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   Many directors guard the perimeter around the video playback with
the ferocity of a bear, but Spielberg seems unfazed, enveloped in an
invisible force field. The one sign of tension is an occasional
chewing of his thumb.</TE>
<TE>   He moves back and forth from his director's chair perch to the
actors in the other room. Spielberg starts off by telling DiCaprio
and Nathalie Baye, who's playing his mother, just to perform the
scene any way they want.</TE>
<TE>   DiCaprio's first take is furious, a primal explosion tearing
through his long limbs. "Why did you divorce him?" he screams. He
storms into the house, but it's difficult for the actor to find the
exact marks, amid a torrent of dialogue. A camera snakes behind him,
and the choreography is elaborate as the little girl and her father
exit the scene, and DiCaprio hunts his mother through her
middle-class lair.</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg readjusts the choreography to suit DiCaprio's emotional
arpeggios, and in successive takes, the actor is alternately more
defeated and scared, a man-boy trying to break through a parent's
hard carapace of aloofness. The scene ends with Baye at her knees,
asking forgiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg doesn't talk about character or motivation, but begins
meticulously cutting lines. "As we go to full tempo, we're going to
cut even more lines," he says. "It has to be natural."</TE>
<TE>   "Steven's incredibly fast, very facile," Hanks says. "He's always
asking us to do it faster. 'OK, that was good. Can you do it faster?'
and we think we're blowing it out as quick as we can and, lo and
behold, we can still take another 17 seconds out of something."</TE>
<TE>   "I think he gives each individual actor whatever it is that they
need," DiCaprio says, who admits that he expected the man who is
arguably the most successful director in history to have more of a
God complex. "I thought someone in that supreme power position must
be arrogant and controlling, but he was the opposite. He was
extremely open to new ideas."</TE>
<TE>   On this afternoon, Spielberg seems to be a grounding, watchful
force, letting DiCaprio soar, but carefully monitoring for
scenery-chewing.</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg is well aware that no actor has ever won an Oscar in his
movies, that critics tend not to champion his performances. That's at
least partly a function of the design of his films -- they tend not
to be tales of flashy neurosis, but parables of simple men in
complicated universes. In Spielberg's films, the story usually is
king.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, the director moves intuitively. He rarely storyboards,
and on this film he simply showed up in the morning and then decided
what he was going to do. He prides himself on shooting the scene in
his head before he begins.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the emotional stickiness of the scene is giving him problems.
He's worried about it becoming maudlin and decides, in an unusual
move, to cover the scene from myriad angles, to keep all his options
open in the editing room.</TE>
<TE>   He tells both actors to refrain from calling each other by their
names and begins to tinker with Baye's performance.</TE>
<TE>   The body language, which initially just seems to illustrate the
words, begins to run at a counterpoint. Baye's character is still
apologizing, not as a supplicant now but as a mother pulling her son
to the succor he craves.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the editing room, Spielberg is still unhappy. He winds up
cutting out almost all of the day's work. "I had real insecurity
about the scene," he admits. "I couldn't articulate what was wrong
with the scene, but I'd be safer if I cut out a few lines."</TE>
<TE>   What remains is suggestive and elliptical, a momentary glance
through an outside window of the pair reconciling.</TE>
<TE>   A single image was all it took.</TE>

<HD>Robert Towne: Gauguin, Van Gogh, James Agee and me</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Towne</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What sets a great screenwriter on his path? Picking up a lifetime
achievement award from the writer's organization PEN West last month,
Robert Towne ("Chinatown," "Shampoo," "Mission: Impossible") thought
back to his beginnings. Here is an excerpt from his remarks.</LD>
<LD>   I grew up in a time when Los Angeles and screenwriting were viewed
along similar lines -- the best thing about L.A. was that you could
turn right on a red light, and the best thing about screenwriting was
that you could take the money and run. More and more, of course, the
profession has taken on the veneer of respectability -- to my
knowledge, there wasn't a single course in screenwriting anywhere in
the country when I wrote my first film.</LD>
<LD>   I remember, when Roman [Polanski] and I began the rewrite on
"Chinatown," he actually found a lone book on the subject and
inscribed: "To my dear colleague, with fond hope." His inscription
was the only thing in the book either one of us read. I mention this
prevailing wisdom about screenwriting, then, not out of any
particular defensiveness, but more out of nostalgia, really, and fond
memories of days when it was still nicely disreputable.</LD>
<TE>   I don't remember the exact moment when I decided that I would take
up screenwriting, but I do remember a defining moment for me when I
realized that it was something that I, at least, could take
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   It came in 1959 in the form of a James Agee screenplay, "Noa Noa,"
which is about the life of Gauguin. One scene in particular affected
me -- Gauguin and Van Gogh painting side by side in a studio. Vincent
at one easel, Gauguin at another:</TE>
<TE>   A short silence of hard peaceful work; the closed stillness of a
rainy day; their unspoken tensions. Then a daddy longlegs gets stuck
in the paint on Gauguin's easel. Gauguin brushes him off the canvas,
drops him and there's an insert of Gauguin's shoe about to crush the
disabled insect.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent cries out in anguish, "No, Paul, don't. Let me have him."</TE>
<TE>   Van Gogh picks up the insect very carefully and sits down, talking
to it, "Were you hurt? Let's just see now...." While he coos and
tries to reassure the daddy longlegs, he takes a match, dips it in
turpentine and delicately begins to clean each one of the bug's
hair-thin legs. "We don't want to lose any more legs, do we? We've
just got to get this miserable paint off ... or you'll be crippled."</TE>
<TE>   Gauguin to Vincent: "He's crippled already. Who wants to live
crippled?"</TE>
<TE>   And Vincent to the bug: "Life is a sacred gift, isn't it? Isn't
it, my dear? You don't want to die until God tells you it's time...."</TE>
<TE>   Agee lets this scene run while Vincent painstakingly finishes
polishing off one leg after another and carefully lets the bug limp
off the palette onto his hand, his knee and the floor, allowing the
bug to walk again.</TE>
<TE>   Gauguin's response is to remove the canvas he's working on and to
put up a fresh one. "Vincent," he says, "I want to paint your
portrait."</TE>
<TE>   Van Gogh is flattered, but reluctant and even worried. "Why do you
want?"</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen something that interests me, just let me do it."</TE>
<TE>   Then Agee has Gauguin at work on Van Gogh while Van Gogh is at
work on his sunflowers, increasingly aware and uncomfortable with
Gauguin's surgically close scrutiny. The tension mounts as Agee
suggests Gauguin's gaze boring into Vincent -- his head, his nose,
his eyes -- with Van Gogh all but writhing under Gauguin's X-ray
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I see it, Paul?"</TE>
<TE>   "Don't move."</TE>
<TE>   "But ... "</TE>
<TE>   "Shut up. I've got it."</TE>
<TE>   Van Gogh is perspiring, feverish, terrified; Gauguin is cold,
intense and busy.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Gauguin, a little trepidatious and sweating himself now,
shows Van Gogh his portrait and Vincent looks and says, "It's me,
Paul. It's me, all right ... but it's me already gone insane."</TE>
<TE>   The scene had my heart in my throat, and I suddenly felt that I
wasn't reading a scene, I was seeing it, and I realized then that a
good screenplay could actually read like it's describing a movie
already made.</TE>
<TE>   It made me realize that so much of what I wanted to say I wanted
to show, or to put it another way, what I wanted to show is so much
of what I had to say. I was pretty much stuck with movies as a way of
saying it.</TE>
<TE>   And so I've given it a whirl.</TE>

<HD>It's just like in the movies: A novice hits the big time</HD>
<DH>Derek Luke goes from a job in the Sony store on the studio
lot to the starring role in 'Antwone Fisher,' directed by Denzel
Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ellen Baskin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it was fate or divine inspiration or maybe just an
old-fashioned Hollywood dreams-can-come-true story. Maybe it was all
those things that worked for Derek Luke, a young, untried actor who,
in his first feature film, got the title role in "Antwone Fisher,"
Denzel Washington's directing debut.</LD>
<LD>   "It just belonged to him," Washington says now of the decision to
cast Luke as the lead. "He was just the right person, the right
spirit for that part."</LD>
<LD>   For Luke, 28, the road started when he was young. "My mother says
I was 4 years old when I asked her to let me pursue acting," he says,
but he can't point to any single motivating factor. "I just believe
it was in me."</LD>
<TE>   The Fox Searchlight film, which opens Dec. 20, is based on the
true story of how Fisher's volatile temper affected his service in
the Navy. After a spate of violent outbursts, Fisher was ordered to
see a naval psychiatrist (Denzel Washington). The film intercuts
between the present and flashbacks to Fisher's childhood in an
abusive foster home, as the doctor helps him examine the cause of his
deeply rooted anger. The screenplay was written by Fisher himself,
his story first told in the memoir "Finding Fish."</TE>
<TE>   Luke grew up in Jersey City, N.J., his stable upbringing a
contrast to Fisher's chaotic life. With his open face and youthful
demeanor, Luke is believable as the teenage Fisher in scenes from the
past and the troubled sailor in the present. During a recent
interview near his home in Pasadena, where he lives with his wife,
Sophia, Luke spoke with quiet confidence, his conversation peppered
with references to fulfilling destiny and a lifelong determination to
follow his heart -- simple, straightforward beliefs grounded more in
spiritual faith than New Age platitudes.</TE>
<TE>   Luke's journey brought him to California in 1995. He had a $1,000
nest egg from a job back home (the money didn't last long) and no
show-business connections. But he was savvy enough to find work on
the periphery of the industry: For about a year, he was an usher for
Audiences Unlimited, shepherding viewers to sitcom tapings on the
Universal Studios lot. That job, he notes fondly, "kept me in the
zone."</TE>
<TE>   Luke remained in the zone once he began working at the retail
store on the Sony Pictures Studios lot in 1996. What's more, at Sony
he met the real-life Antwone Fisher, who had segued from on-lot
security guard to screenwriter with a development deal. When Luke
learned that a film based on Fisher was being developed, he knew it
was "a supposed-to-be place for me" and kept up to date on the
project's status. "I sold the trades" at the Sony store, he says. "I
read them. They were my friends."</TE>
<TE>   Hearing of auditions for "Antwone Fisher," Luke showed up,
unannounced and uninvited. But no one was there. He'd gotten the time
wrong. Later, when auditions did take place, Luke finagled an
appointment with the help of a friend who worked in another casting
office. Although he "bombed the audition," Luke made enough of an
impression to get a callback. That audition went much better, but
then the project was shut down because of Washington's schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Luke continued working at the Sony store. During the next few
years, he took a handful of acting lessons and had brief appearances
on the sitcoms "Moesha" and "The King of Queens." In mid-2001 he
heard that "Antwone Fisher" was back on. An audition with casting
director Robi Reed-Humes went well enough that Luke was called in to
meet Washington, one of Luke's childhood idols.</TE>
<TE>   "It was magical," Luke says of that encounter. "I just told myself
I'm going to let my heart take over and left it at that."</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks later, Fisher came by the Sony store while Luke was
working. After chatting, Luke walked Fisher outside and spotted
Washington walking with Todd Black, the film's producer, toward the
store. Unknown to Luke, the two were on their way to tell him he'd
gotten the part. They didn't know Fisher would be there too.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw Denzel, and I saw Todd, and I like to froze," Luke recalls.
"I thought, I'm not going to speak to [Denzel]. I figured, if he
comes to speak to Antwone, maybe he'll remember my face. And then" --
even now, he is briefly overcome at the memory -- "he called me
Antwone," he says softly, repeating himself as if it's still a little
hard to believe. "He called me Antwone."</TE>
<TE>   When it came time to get to work, Luke put his personal philosophy
to professional use. "Read the script, be honest and listen to the
heart of the character," is all he can say about how he prepared for
his big-screen debut. Luke believes that the message behind "Antwone
Fisher" is "heal the past and be clean in the now."</TE>
<TE>   As to how Washington helped most with his performance, Luke
responds with one word: "freedom." The actor-director offered
guidance and made suggestions, but always "it was carved around
freedom."</TE>
<TE>   When Washington first heard about "Antwone Fisher," he was
attracted to both the story and the man behind the intense personal
tale. He also liked the fact that "this is a performance kind of
story, and I think that's my strength." Washington enjoyed sharing
that strength with the young actor in the lead -- but was not nearly
as keen on directing himself. So how receptive was a two-time
Oscar-winning actor to taking orders from a novice director?
Washington laughs at the question.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very difficult to work with, very difficult on the set. I
almost had to fire him." More seriously, he adds, "I prefer just
directing to acting and directing at the same time. I didn't like
that. I really wanted to take the time to work with Derek, and it was
hard to split the time."</TE>
<TE>   After finishing "Antwone Fisher," Luke found himself in demand;
he's just finishing up work on the film "Biker Boyz," in which he
co-stars with Laurence Fishburne and Eriq LaSalle. He's also in the
upcoming "Pieces of April" opposite Katie Holmes. And in December,
he'll be on public view in more than just "Antwone Fisher," having
recently posed for a series of Gap ads.</TE>
<TE>   The approaching "Antwone Fisher" opening and media spotlight are
"pretty much breathtaking," Luke admits. As to what he'll do next,
"I'm just looking for more predestined roles," he says. "I believe a
message is written on every man's heart, and based on that message,
he can't help but attract what belongs to him, like a magnet."</TE>

<HD>Lessons from the dormitory</HD>
<DH>The cloistered realm of the boarding school is fertile film
territory for exploring social ills and intense relationships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marshall Fine</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's nothing like a boarding school to bring out the fevered
obsessions of a group of people and turn their domain into a
microcosm of the big, bad world -- at least in the movies.</LD>
<LD>   In boarding-school movies, the most pressing problems of the world
at that moment are distilled (or reduced) to the simplest human terms
in a tightly controlled setting. Maybe it's that petri-dish quality
that brings out the behavior: the enclosed, closely monitored
environment, usually fraught with repressive rules and conformist
behavior. Who wouldn't want to act out?</LD>
<LD>   Not all boarding-school movies (not to be confused with the
military-school subgenre) take a whack at social issues. Sometimes,
they are character studies of the kind of outsize personality
necessary to be a compelling teacher. Or they use the rigors of this
disciplined academic setting as a backdrop for a coming-of-age story
about a student who discovers some previously unknown truth about
himself.</LD>
<TE>   Just as often, these movies are the backdrop for the story of that
fortuitous symbiosis between teacher and student: "The Emperor's
Club," for example, looks at the relationship between a teacher and
one student who makes a distinctive impression on him.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for all the things that make these movies unique, there are
a few conventions that pull them together in a world of their own.</TE>

<HD>Adrien Brody takes on Chopin, Polanski and the burden of
history</HD>
<DH>He endures harsh conditions in making 'The Pianist' for the
chance to explore the lead role in depth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lanie Goodman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Cannes, France</DL>
<LD>Adrien Brody doesn't have a movie-star swagger or an ingratiating
smile for strangers, and that served him well at the Cannes Film
Festival last summer. He could stride past the gawking pen- and
pad-toting fans gathered outside the Hotel Carlton and breeze through
the lobby without a barrage of popping flashbulbs.</LD>
<LD>   After the world premiere of director Roman Polanski's "The
Pianist," in which Brody plays the lead role, an audience of more
than 3,500 rose to its feet for an emotional 20-minute ovation. The
film later won the festival's Palme d'Or. The film opens Dec. 27.</LD>
<LD>   Tall and lanky, dressed in a cream-colored suit with his dark hair
slicked back, Brody plays up his convincing resemblance to the
somber, real-life character he portrays, Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish
Jew and virtuoso pianist who escaped deportation and survived in the
ruins of the Warsaw ghetto during the German occupation.</LD>
<TE>   Based on Szpilman's bestselling memoirs, the film recounts the
musician's tormented years of isolation from 1939 -- when a bomb is
dropped on Warsaw in the middle of his radio broadcast of Chopin's
Nocturne in D minor -- to 1945, just prior to Poland's liberation,
when a compassionate German officer comes to his rescue.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that I had a great deal of responsibility in portraying an
actual historic figure, especially someone who survived the Holocaust
in hiding," Brody explains. "Wladyslaw Szpilman was 88 when he died
in July 2000. I never met him but Polanski met him several times. We
watched documentaries and I was supplied with a lot of literature.
And Roman told me stories from his own childhood about the bombing of
Warsaw and surviving the Krakow ghetto."</TE>
<TE>   The actor talks slowly and deliberately, his long, articulate
sentences punctuated by reflective pauses. At 29, Brody has already
worked with an impressive list of directors -- Steven Soderbergh
("King of the Hill"), Terrence Malick ("The Thin Red Line"), Spike
Lee ("Summer of Sam"), Barry Levinson ("Liberty Heights") and Ken
Loach ("Bread and Roses"). But the part in Polanski's film wasn't
intended for an American actor. More than 1,400 European auditioners
turned up for the casting call for a man between 25 and 35 of "slight
build, dark coloring" who was "sensitive, vulnerable and
charismatic," but apparently none was right for it.</TE>
<TE>   "My ancestors on my father's side are Polish Jewish, so I could
relate," Brody says. "I also think I possess a kind of European
quality, even though I'm definitely a product of a very urban
environment in Brooklyn where I was born." Mastering a Polish accent
was one of the least daunting challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the kind of actor who likes to connect as much as I can to
the state of mind of the character. In an effort to play Szpilman, a
man who loses everything, I eliminated a lot of things in my own life
before I left for Berlin and Warsaw for eight months. I sold my car,
dropped my apartment, put everything in storage, got rid of my cell
phone, and fired some people ..." his voice trails off.</TE>
<TE>   Brody also lost a tremendous amount of weight, and had to follow a
specific diet before and during the shoot. "When I was my thinnest
and most destroyed I just sat around and existed," he sighs. "I
didn't talk to anyone for days. It was a pretty sad place to be and I
was probably as unhappy as I've ever been in my life."</TE>
<TE>   The actor is quick to add that despite the harsh conditions --
bitter cold, long hours on the set, no stand-ins, no stuntmen and
little rest between scenes -- he feels privileged to be part of such
a serious film and able to explore a character in such depth.
"Besides, when you work with Polanski, there's no point in
complaining because it doesn't get you anywhere," he declares with a
wry smile.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a scene where I'm climbing a fence and can barely make it
over -- I wasn't acting! We'd done it so many times with a crane shot
and I didn't have any strength left. I weighed about 130 pounds and
all my muscles were gone. I told Roman I had no energy and he
answered" -- Brody pauses and mimics a Polish accent -- " 'Ach, you
actors! What do you need energy for? Just do it !' "</TE>
<TE>   "Roman is such a tough guy -- tough in the best sense of the word,
because he's so good at doing so many things. In one scene, people
are shooting at me and I was supposed to slide headfirst off a
clay-tile roof, then fall and jump through the veranda. I asked if
someone had done it already, if I could see how it worked." Polanski
himself scrambled up to the roof and gracefully slid down. "He hung
onto the edge and jumped better than Harrison Ford could have done.
It blew me away," Brody recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Though he was never trained as a classical pianist, Brody felt
compelled to learn how to play Chopin, and is now glad he did. "Had I
just acted like I was playing the piano, I wouldn't have understood
the story within Chopin's music, which is an extremely powerful force
for my character." Brody composes his own hip-hop sequences on the
synthesizer, and his keyboard was one of the few things he brought
with him. "It's kind of dark, slow New York-style bass accompaniment,
but it's become more melodic since Chopin. Now I can throw in some
fancy key work."</TE>
<TE>   "My father actually played Chopin in a different way than in the
film," states Andrzej Szpilman, the pianist's 46-year-old son, in a
phone interview. "But that's not important. Obviously, I am very
close to the story, and I was very moved by Adrien's performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Polanski definitely made the right choice for the role, as my
father knew he would," Andrzej Szpilman says. "He said to me, 'We can
trust Polanski, first because he's a survivor and he's lived long
enough in Poland to understand, and also because he's a great
artist.' "</TE>
<TE>   After his work on "The Pianist," Brody said, "I remember saying to
my father, who is a history teacher, that young Americans are
extremely fortunate not to have experienced war on their soil,
because the repercussions of World War II are still very visible in
Warsaw. Then the World Trade Center was attacked. I went down there
with my mom, who is a photojournalist, and took pictures. The
emotions I felt -- the sadness, anger and the fear from this
destructive inhumanity -- were very similar to what I'd been
experiencing playing Szpilman.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't work after 'The Pianist' for almost a year," he nearly
whispers, looking down. "Not that there weren't opportunities.
Nothing really inspired me, or the roles seemed too superficial. I
had done three or four movies in a row and I was exhausted. I became
a vegetarian for six months, went to Hawaii, took care of myself."</TE>
<TE>   Brody takes a deep breath. "I'm much more disciplined. I've grown
up, I'm more ready for life and its obstacles. And," he smiles, "I
complain a little less."</TE>

<HD>Transformed by the soul of Woolf</HD>
<DH>'The Hours,' which stars an almost unrecognizable Nicole
Kidman as the noted author, took more than a few months to complete.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Gritten</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Richmond, England</DL>
<LD>Producer Scott Rudin sprawls casually in a director's chair, eyes
darting between a monitor and the scene being played before him. We
are in a London suburb on the banks of the Thames; a leafy walkway
with glorious river views has been dressed to make it look as it did
in 1923. A tall, forbidding, intense-looking woman with a big
aquiline nose and faded auburn hair swept back into a severe bun
walks alone, distractedly talking to herself, oblivious to the
curious glances of passers-by.</LD>
<LD>   "She'll die!" the woman mumbles. "She's going to die. That's
what's going to happen. She'll kill herself. She'll kill herself over
something that doesn't matter."</LD>
<LD>   The woman is pale, her face bare of makeup. She wears stylish
clothes carelessly: a straw hat perched on her head, a gray
thigh-length cardigan over a floral print dress. Her brown shoes are
scuffed, her silk stockings in terrible condition. As she speaks, she
has the air of someone whose life is falling apart.</LD>
<TE>   Director Stephen Daldry murmurs "Cut," and this unrecognizable
woman relaxes, drifts over to meet a visitor to the set and brightly
says, "Hi!" It's extraordinary. Even from a distance of 3 feet, even
allowing that we have met before and even when she lapses cheerfully
into her native Australian accent, it seems incredible that this
could be Nicole Kidman. If you didn't know, you couldn't possibly
guess.</TE>
<TE>   But it is, of course. Kidman plays the distinguished English
novelist Virginia Woolf in "The Hours," a film adaptation of Michael
Cunningham's 1998 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. "The Hours,"
distributed by Paramount in North America and by Miramax elsewhere,
attempts to trace Woolf's creative process in writing her
groundbreaking 1925 novel "Mrs. Dalloway," her suicide 16 years
later, and the stories of two fictional women in more recent eras who
were influenced by Woolf's life and work.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I know," Kidman says of her astonishing transformation. She
starts to move a hand up toward her large prosthetic nose but thinks
better of it. "Well, you really have to get inside this character.
You need to feel different."</TE>
<TE>   She resumes her position for her walkway monologue and this time
completes it to Daldry's satisfaction. From his perch behind the
monitor, Rudin is beaming. "I'd have to say things are going well,"
he reflects. "After all, it's like we're making three little movies
here."</TE>
<TE>   One sees what he means. Three separate visits to the set of "The
Hours" between March and June last year would have left any visitor
unfamiliar with Cunningham's novel deeply puzzled about the story.
The Virginia Woolf scenes were shot last, though one of them opens
the film; it shows the novelist placing heavy stones into the pockets
of her coat and walking into a river near her home.</TE>
<TE>   One of the three stories in "The Hours" is contemporary and set in
New York City. Its central character, played by Meryl Streep, is a
middle-age woman, Clarissa (who shares a first name with Woolf's
heroine Mrs. Dalloway). It tracks a landmark day in her life, during
which she buys flowers and plans a party for her old friend Richard
(Ed Harris), a poet suffering from the ravages of AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   The film's third story takes place in 1951 Los Angeles, where
Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), a suburban housewife with a 6-year-old
son, Richie, feels trapped by motherhood and by her marriage to Dan,
(John C. Reilly), her dutiful, dull husband. Laura is reading "Mrs.
Dalloway" and empathizes with its heroine, another woman whose life
seems to be unraveling.</TE>
<TE>   The emotional scene being shot during one of those earlier visits
is set in Clarissa's book-cluttered apartment, fashioned by
production designer Maria Djurkovic on a sound stage at Pinewood
Studios, about 20 miles west of London. This is the climax of the
Clarissa story; it is the end of the day of the planned party (which
never materialized) and she is left with rooms full of flowers and
uneaten food.</TE>
<TE>   Streep, Allison Janney, who plays her girlfriend Sally, and Claire
Danes (her daughter Julia) are dressed in robes, ready for bed.
"Yeah, it's not a bad day when you go to work in your pajamas," Danes
wisecracks as she drifts off set between scenes. Streep takes her cue
from the clothes she is wearing; between setups she curls up on a
sofa and falls asleep.</TE>
<TE>   The food, an important component of this scene, has been imported
from London's chic River Cafe: fresh salmon, fresh tuna, duck breasts
and live crabs await consumption. The smell of the feast wafts under
the noses of a frustrated crew, which is virtually salivating.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days later and everything has changed. Shooting has shifted to
an adjacent Pinewood sound stage, where Djurkovic has created Laura
Brown's suburban L.A. home, all blond wood, with a 14-inch Zenith
television in the living room, and a bathroom in which turquoise is
the predominant color. Little Richie's bathroom boasts wallpaper with
pictures of cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   In Laura's kitchen, Daldry and Julianne Moore are rehearsing a
scene with Jack Rovello, the child actor playing Richie. It is Dan's
birthday, and Laura is trying ineptly to bake him a cake; together
she and Richie must sift flour. Daldry kneels down beside the boy and
explains in calm, patient tones how he wants the sifting done. He is
accustomed to this tutoring approach; "Billy Elliot," Daldry's
previous film and also his feature debut, also involved big roles for
young, inexperienced actors.</TE>
<TE>   "Stephen's doing a great job," says Moore, seating herself on
Richie's bed between takes. "This is a pretty massive undertaking,
after all. But he has a great sense of the material. And I like the
actors he's chosen. You can tell a lot about a director by the people
he chooses."</TE>
<TE>   Moore received Cunningham's novel as a birthday gift three years
ago. "I really loved it but never thought it was a movie. Then I met
with Scott Rudin, who told me he loved it too. In meeting Scott, I
realized he'd offered me a lot of work over the years, none of which
I'd done. He showed me the script [by English playwright David Hare]
and I was really impressed by it. David has stayed close to the tone
of the book -- it's a really faithful adaptation. And the next thing
I knew, Scott got back to me to say Stephen wanted to meet me."</TE>
<TE>   After being cast as Laura, Moore decided to read Woolf's "Mrs.
Dalloway." "It's so surprising. It's about moments of your life.
Nothing is ever monumental. Baking a cake, buying flowers for a party
-- that's what our lives are made up with."</TE>
<TE>   Daldry agrees. "We think of Mrs. Dalloway as trivial and
bourgeois. But you do sympathize with her."</TE>
<TE>   A reshoot required</TE>
<TE>   Fast forward 18 months. It's the prelude, at last, to the release
of "The Hours," and Daldry is musing about the long gestation of his
film, which opens Dec. 27. He sits on a sofa in his office, which
fittingly for a man so closely associated with the stage (he was
artistic director at the prestigious Royal Court for five glittering
years) is situated in the heart of London's theater district, four
floors above Shaftesbury Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Why the long delay? "There was a problem that required a reshoot,"
he says flatly. "Originally, we hired an actress to play Laura as an
older woman for some scenes late on in the film. There was nothing
wrong with the actress, she was fine, but when we saw the footage, it
was as if a new character was being introduced, so we decided to age
Julianne and use her."</TE>
<TE>   Because Moore had other film commitments, she was unable to do the
reshoot immediately, so it was scheduled for Sept. 13 last year, just
two days after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. "No
one could fly," Daldry shrugged. "We finally did it at Pinewood at
the start of this year. And this was always a year-end film, anyway."</TE>
<TE>   He feels the wait was worth it. "Because we spent so much time
with David on the script, we knew how [the three stories] would fit
together, and that didn't change in the cutting room. David writes
women so sensitively." Daldry smiles impishly. "He's like an honorary
woman."</TE>
<TE>   And women are absolutely crucial to the film, with three towering
female roles at its center. Daldry is grateful his three lead
actresses had stage experience. "We'd rehearse as if we were doing a
play. I didn't have to learn a new language. There was a level of
mutuality in our approach to the work."</TE>
<TE>   Of Kidman, he says, "She's a transforming actress. She isn't just
a movie star. She can really act. A transforming movie star is rare."
Daldry grins slyly at this point. "My relationship with her was
entirely with her nose on. It became much easier to work like that.
She was a new person, someone I can totally relate to. I was never
dealing with Nicole the movie star, but Nicole the actress with a
nose on. So when she took it off, I was like, 'Hello, I'm Stephen.'
It's as if one had to relate to two different people."</TE>
<TE>   He recalls the film's opening scene, with Kidman submerging
herself in the river. "You try telling her we'd use a stunt double,"
Daldry says with a sigh. "She's fearless. My big fear was drowning
Nicole Kidman. I put frogmen in the water, but I had a stopwatch, and
she was still under after two minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Through the process of working and reworking "The Hours," his
dealings with Paramount executives were harmonious. Of Rudin, a
guiding force of the movie who was regularly on the set, he says: "He
allowed me freedom and kept pushing the boundaries of what was
possible. So now I can show the film, and say, 'Like it or not,
that's what we meant. There's no other version I can say is a
director's cut. What you see, that's what we meant."</TE>
<TE>   While the film, made for a budget reported at a slim $21 million,
looks certain to figure prominently in the coming awards season, can
it find a mass audience? Daldry says it was screened for audiences in
London and New York and its appeal was wider than expected. "Younger
women and older men liked it as well as older women."</TE>
<TE>   He concedes it is a film for grown-ups. "I did find it remarkably
upsetting. I was upset in the right way and in the right places --
that sense of the women feeling trapped, that feeling you're going
mad.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel getting older is almost a process of trying to cope with
grief. Not just people dying, but lost possibilities and lost
moments. Those three women trying to break out of that cycle of
grief, and risking everything to do it, I found incredibly
distressing yet hopeful. I came out feeling great."</TE>

<HD>The backups, up front</HD>
<DH>It took 11 years to get made, but a documentary finally
puts the spotlight on the Funk Brothers, unheralded players who
helped define the Motown sound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emory Holmes II</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Motown story has been told in many ways, usually from the point
of view of one of the label's stars, such as Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross,
Stevie Wonder or Smokey Robinson. But the upcoming documentary
"Standing in the Shadows of Motown" extends the spotlight to the
background players -- namely, the skilled collective of Detroit
musicians known as the Funk Brothers.</LD>
<LD>   These background musicians were like mentoring, elder brothers to
Motown's inexperienced roster of stars during the 1960s, and their
simplified, jazz- and blues-informed licks provided the sonic pulse
for the distinctive Motor City sound that Berry Gordy Jr. and his
young label mates were then concocting, as Gordy later famously
quipped, from "a combination of rats, roaches, soul, guts and love."</LD>
<LD>   Loosely based on Allan Slutsky's heralded 1989 book "Standing in
the Shadows of Motown: The Life and Music of Legendary Bassist James
Jamerson," the film is directed by Paul Justman ("Let the Good Times
Roll") and is produced by Justman, Slutsky and L.A. trial and
entertainment lawyer Sandy Passman. After his book won the Rolling
Stone/Ralph J. Gleason Award for music book of the year, Slutsky -- a
studio musician known as "Dr. Licks" -- thought of adapting his
story, then confined to Jamerson, Motown's brilliant bassist.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew I had found the last unmined, unexplored totally virgin
story of rock 'n' roll from the '60s," Slutsky recalled by phone
recently from his Philadelphia home. "When you ask most people,
'What's the Motown story?,' they say The Temptations or Diana Ross,
but being a musician I'm a little twisted. To me it's the story of an
incredible studio band with a bunch of revolving vocalists."</TE>
<TE>   Trained in jazz, the Funk Brothers established a link between the
swinging complexities of jazz and the streamlined urban rhythms of
Motor City pop. Each of the Funk Brothers had a special skill.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Ashford, for example, played jazz tambourine. In 1962,
Ashford recalled recently, "we were dying in this club up in Boston,
playing 'Take 5' by Dave Brubeck, and I was on vibes. And Charles
Harris, the bandleader, hands me a tambourine. I said, 'What am I
gonna do with this thing?' He said, 'Play it.' I picked it up and it
took on a life of its own. People started piling in the club to hear
[me] playing jazz tambourine."</TE>
<TE>   One of those who heard him was Marvin Gaye, who in 1963 brought
Ashford to Motown, where he was asked to concentrate exclusively on
the tambourine, "because it added another dimension to music and
rhythmically it locked it together."</TE>
<TE>   "Berry had simple chord changes, you know," Funk Brothers
keyboardist Joe White said, describing a typical Motown recording
session. "He would hum his melodies and we would put what we thought
went with it."</TE>
<TE>   Justman wanted the film to "break the idea that this music was
done like an assembly line." He wanted audiences to see the Funk
Brothers as "the hippest guys in the world. I wanted the viewer to
think of them as young, even though most of the time you are seeing
an older guy speak. I created reenactments to give you some vision of
what they were like: young, hip, funny and together."</TE>
<TE>   Others did not share that vision -- and so began Slutsky and
Justman's 11-year struggle to get "Standing in the Shadows" made. The
Artisan film opens in Los Angeles on Nov. 15.</TE>
<TE>   "I pounded the pavement for a year and a half and just got blank
faces. They just didn't get it." Slutsky recalled. "Instead of
letting the anger eat me up," Slutsky added, he used his bitter diet
of rejection as a motivational tool. In those lean years, Slutsky
relied on the support of two college roommates who believed in the
project. "My two college friends Steve Brown and Richard Adler said,
'Don't give up. It's going to happen.' They told me that for 11
years."</TE>
<TE>   At the urging of producer Janis Ginsberg, a mutual acquaintance of
Slutsky and Justman, Slutsky saw "Let the Good Times Roll," Justman's
1991 documentary on the music of New Orleans, and gave the director a
call. As Justman recalls, "Allan asked me if I would like to do the
film and said, 'It's about this group in Motown,' and I said, 'Allan
I've read your book. I love the book. I would love to do this movie.
All of my whole career leads up to this movie.' "</TE>
<TE>   Justman uses rare images of Motown sessions and tours, as well as
period photographs of the Detroit cityscape, and the joints and clubs
where the guys hung out.</TE>
<TE>   The Funk Brothers' lives and artistry are explored in first-person
accounts from family members and musicians who lived the story
alongside them. Each vignette is punctuated by a familiar Motown hit.
Recorded in December 2000 at a Detroit concert, the songs feature the
Funk Brother who helped create them backing up such contemporary
vocalists as Ben Harper, Meshell Ndegeocello, Chaka Khan and others.
That concert provides the film's emotional anchor.</TE>
<TE>   Explained Justman: "I felt it was important to establish right
from the start that I'm not making a movie about the politics of
music, I'm not making a movie about the economics of music, I'm
making a movie about the joy of music because that's how these guys
began."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, time is of the essence</TE>
<TE>   Before their focus widened to include all the Funk Brothers, they
had pitched a $20-million feature film, Slutsky says, "with Cuba
Gooding Jr. in the role of James Jamerson, but we never got any
takers." "We talked on the phone every night for 10 years," says
Justman, an L.A. resident. "We pitched this film hundreds of times.
We went everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   When one of the Funk Brothers, Robert White, died in 1994, Justman
became nervous that the window for making a documentary about the
backup group was closing. So Justman told Slutsky, " 'Look, I'm going
to take my little video camera and I'm going to go up to Detroit and
I'm going to start making this movie in the way that I can do it.' It
was just going to be me and Allan and the Funk Brothers." Slutsky
urged Justman to wait -- something was bound to happen.</TE>
<TE>   And it did. By happenstance, another Justman projects was being
represented by a management firm headed by attorney Passman, and
following a luncheon chat, Passman asked him if he had any additional
projects of note. "I started telling him the story of the Funk
Brothers," Justman recalls, "and tears started coming down his face.
I knew right then he was the right guy to co-produce. He was able to
maneuver in the business world and help us secure the [licensing] of
the Motown songs as well as the artists" in the live concert.</TE>
<TE>   As Passman tells it, his luck was only slightly better than his
co-producers. "Allan and Paul had been rejected for nine years before
I got involved. I expected to get into more rooms than they did,
which I did. But people in this town who didn't know how to wrap
themselves around the truth didn't have the courage to lie to us, so
what they did was worse -- they stalled us. But as I proceeded to
forge my way through that, I never believed for a second that we
would not prevail."</TE>
<TE>   Around that time, Slutsky experienced what he characterizes as his
"horrible miracle." His college friend Steve died in Philadelphia.
Richard, the other roommate, was in L.A. on business at the time and
flew back to the East Coast for the funeral in March 2000. Slutsky
picks up the story: "On the flight back, he sits next to this guy and
they strike up a conversation. They find out they are both musicians
and the guy says he's a bass player. And [Richard] says, "Oh, my
friend wrote a famous book on bass players called 'Standing in the
Shadows of Motown' and the guy says, 'You mean Slutsky?' "</TE>
<TE>   That guy turned out to be Paul Elliot, who had just sold his fiber
optic company. "Doing a film was the furthest thing from my mind,"
Elliot said. "But I had heard, kind of through the Internet
grapevine, that Allan had been trying to turn [his book] into a film,
but that was years before and I had kind of forgotten about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally gave Richard my business card and told him to have
Allan give me a call." Elliot called his business partner, David
Scott, and he said, " 'Yeah I'd like to get in on that.' It's just a
pretty spectacular set of coincidences that brought David and me into
this."</TE>
<TE>   The movie -- Entertainment Weekly deemed it "jubilant" when it
screened at the Toronto Film Festival -- was filmed on location in
Detroit in December 2001 for $3 million. "That figure is deceiving
though," Passman says. "Keep in mind that we not only made a movie,
we also put on a concert and produced a record."</TE>
<TE>   Slutsky took the project very personally: "I really couldn't live
with myself if I had not been able to deliver because I had schlepped
the guys around and raised [their expectations]....They'd said,
'Well, we're backup musicians; our role is to look at the singer's
butt and to watch him get applause. And for 16 years I schlepped them
around saying, 'You're a star. You deserve to be celebrated -- you
deserve to have people giving you standing ovations.' "</TE>
<TE>   About the recognition that the film may bring them, Funk Brother
Jack Ashford said, "We haven't gotten used to it yet. This is just
like a dream. I'm expecting to wake up one day and it all [didn't]
happen."</TE>

<LD>I was amazed and gratified to see Steven Schiff, co-chairman of the
Writers Guild's credit review committee, actually admit, "The stature
of writers would be enhanced if we had one writer per film" ("To the
Rescue?" by Rachel Abramowitz, Oct. 27). But, sadly, while
recognizing this simple fact, he vociferously leads the charge to
undermine such a laudable goal and touts credit changes that, if
adopted, will lead to further credit expansion and, regrettably, more
vicious infighting, pitting writer against writer.</LD>
<LD>   Mr. Schiff dismisses the idea of one writer, one film as a "pipe
dream." I pity his cynicism. I always thought writers were supposed
to be the pipe-dreamers, the windmill-tilters, the fighters for the
ideal. I would much rather struggle toward making this ideal a
reality than to fatalistically accept credit proposals that
facilitate the weak and greedy among us to cannibalize their fellow
writers. It is better for credits to reach for an honorable dream
than to reinforce the sad, sordid, shameful truth that writers will
viciously savage each other to get their name on a movie.</LD>

<LD>In David Thomson's article on the homage paid to so-called women's
pictures by "Far From Heaven" ("Back to the Days of Subversive
Innocence," Oct. 27), he cites the two early versions of "Back
Street" with Irene Dunne and Margaret Sullavan. But given the case he
makes for the high-gloss, Technicolor films of Douglas Sirk, wouldn't
it have made more sense to have also included the 1961 version of
this Fannie Hurst story that starred Susan Hayward at her most
long-suffering best, with a wardrobe by Jean Louis? This David
Miller-directed remake was produced by the same Ross Hunter who
produced the Sirk movies.</LD>

<LD>I certainly sympathize with David Rambo's annoyance with impolite
audience members who prevent each other from listening to a play due
to ringing cell phones, crinkling cellophane wrappers and talking
among themselves ("The Drama of Listening," Oct. 20). What I find odd
is his romantic harking back to the time of Elizabethan drama when
theatergoers actually went to "hear a play." Rambo seems to have
overlooked that Elizabethan audiences had the far more distracting
problems of constant chattering (especially from the rabble in the
pit); the never-ending coming and going of people during the
performance; vendors selling food and drink in the aisles; and, since
it was often an outside venue, whatever noise forced its way in from
the local environment.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not sure what I find more dangerous to the future of theater:
the very rare instances of rudeness that Rambo alludes to, or the
almost hallowed atmosphere that he seems to desire for his personal
house of worship.</LD>

<TE>   I was startled to read Rambo's assertion that until the late 19th
century the theater was a place to hear but not to see or feel, and
that it lacked "momentum." Was Aristotle hallucinating when he
described the drama of his time (and, prophetically, ours as well) as
structured on those very elements? Indeed Aristotle insists that a
play has a setting, is acted, not narrated, and that tragedy evokes
pity and fear. Created in the theater is a world of imagination and
pretense in which the audience itself collaborates. As such, the
power of Sophocles or Shakespeare, of Wilder or Beckett, would not be
increased by realistic stage settings.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly the convention of realism expanded the resources of the
stage, but credit for that innovation can hardly go to Augustin Daly,
as Rambo suggests. In fact the sensationalism of directors like Daly
was exactly what Shaw thought it his mission to expunge from the
stage as he sought to resurrect the theater as temple.</TE>

<TE>   Thank you, David Rambo and Calendar, for printing one of the
sanest, sweetest, clearest, most moving "think" pieces about the
theater I've read in any paper for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   Working in the theater here for the last 24 years, acting,
writing, directing and now teaching, I have longed to see this level
of profound reflection on the whys and wherefores of our ancient
craft acknowledged so thoughtfully. Beyond reviews and profiles of
theaters and personalities, it is not only a great pleasure to read
an intelligent playwright's overview of the meaning of it all, but a
great service to the Los Angeles community as well. In writing about
the nature of listening, Mr. Rambo cuts to the core of the most
important relationship that exists for the theater in a healthy
community -- the receptivity of its audience. We are all healthier
for his thoughts.</TE>

<LD>While I was glad to see an article about Dave Eggers' recent
publishing endeavors ("Eggers' Trail of Broken Hearts," by Shawn
Hubler, Oct. 20), I was strongly disappointed by the section about
his sister. The discussion of her death was handled inappropriately
and callously, including unnecessary details about the circumstances,
apparently for sensational effect. The article addressed Mr. Eggers'
professional efforts as a novelist, publisher and publicity-dodger;
there was no need to dish out those painful, personal details. Such
an approach reflects the increasingly objectionable condition of The
Times' journalistic standards.</LD>

<DH>The makers of the second installments of 'Harry Potter' and
'Lord of the Rings' face even greater expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fidelity has long been a touchy subject here in modern Babylon, but
last year Hollywood had a very particular faithfulness issue. Could
two worldly men, film directors at that, really understand the nature
of devotion, constancy and commitment?</LD>
<LD>   In a matter of a few weeks, those fears were assuaged. The many
devoted readers of J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone" and J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Fellowship of the Ring" showered
directors Chris Columbus and Peter Jackson with fistfuls of ticket
stubs in gratitude for the respect they showed in their film
adaptations of these works. Indeed, the criticism most often leveled
at "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" was that it was too
faithful to the book.</LD>
<LD>   So this year, as audiences prepare for Round 2 -- the Nov. 15
release of Warner Bros.' "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"
and the Dec. 19 opening of New Line's "The Two Towers" -- the fans
are very calm. Impatient, but calm.</LD>
<TE>   Which actually makes the filmmakers a little nervous. Because the
only thing more daunting than a suspicious audience is a really,
really expectant one.</TE>
<TE>   For both directors, success came with a few strings attached.
Although the budget for the second Harry Potter film is reportedly
about the same as the first -- about $125 million -- the hope is that
even more dazzling special effects will break through the disdain
many critics and adult viewers felt for the by-the-book script of
"Sorcerer's Stone." But the film is still only the second of what was
originally conceived as a series of seven books and films, and so
must prove that the Harry Potter franchise is still on the upswing.</TE>
<TE>   Across a few time zones in New Zealand, Jackson has worked
steadily through the $300 million pledged by New Line at the onset of
the project. "The Two Towers" also will introduce characters and
scenes representing the latest in film technology, but that will not
address the biggest obstacle the film faces. The extraordinary
critical success of "The Fellowship of the Ring" set a high bar: To
make this middle film of a trilogy best picture or best director
material will require all kinds of magic, computer or otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "There was much more pressure this year," said Jackson from New
Zealand. "For 'Fellowship,' " he said, "we had the advantage of being
the mystery film. This time, we don't have the future of the studio
riding on our shoulders, but we have to worry about the millions of
people who loved the first film, who are counting on us."</TE>
<TE>   The makers of "Chamber of Secrets" felt much the same way, with
the additional nagging memory of critics' charges that they had gone
too strictly by the book last time around. "The goal was to make a
film that was even better than the first," said Columbus. And having
the trust of the fans made that task much easier. "We had proved to
the audience that we were faithful, so with the second film we could
be a little more relaxed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Which is not to say that Columbus threw caution, or Rowling's
book, to the wind. When Columbus says "more relaxed," he's referring
to a few ad-libbed exchanges and a couple of drawn-out action
sequences. But overall, "Chamber of Secrets" is a more
straightforward adventure tale. The paintings and staircases still
move, Quidditch players whiz through the air, but neither the
characters nor the camera spend much time in wide-eyed wonder at
this. Even the appearance of Dobby, the computer-generated house elf,
is pretty much taken in stride by Harry, and the story line.</TE>
<TE>   "Magic is more magic when it's just there. The first movie was
about Harry discovering what is essentially his home," producer David
Heyman said. "The second film is about what he does when that home is
threatened."</TE>
<TE>   "Second film" is the term both sets of filmmakers are using to
avoid the word "sequel." This is not, they would have you know, "Home
Alone 2" or "Batman Returns" territory. And according to Columbus and
Jackson, the new films are very different in mood and focus.</TE>
<TE>   " 'The Fellowship' was much more whimsical," Jackson said. "And it
had to cover a lot of ground, backstory-wise--it was a half-hour
before we even got out of the Shire. 'The Two Towers' is much more of
an adventure film, with horses and swords and battles."</TE>
<TE>   "The Two Towers" begins right after the final action in
"Fellowship," and if people are expecting a when-we-last-saw-them
prologue to get them up to speed, they're out of luck. "That is just
too TV miniseries," he said. "And I'm not really concerned with the
people who didn't see 'The Fellowship'why would they be going to see
this movie if they didn't see that one?"</TE>
<TE>   "Chamber of Secrets" also forgoes any kind of recap, but over at
Warner Bros., folks have a slightly different definition of a
non-sequel sequel. They stress that, like the books, each film can
stand on its own. "You don't have to have seen the first film to
enjoy the second," Heyman said, "although it makes it a richer
experience if you have."</TE>
<TE>   "Chamber of Secrets" too is different in tone and focus from its
predecessor. It is a bit more sinister and more psychologically
complex, which reflects the filmmaker's intentions as much as it
follows similar shifts in Rowling's book.</TE>
<TE>   "The film is darker," Heyman said, "but fairy tales traditionally
are a way of preparing children for what lies ahead. The world is not
a safe place."</TE>
<TE>   The script focuses on the three (or four, if you count Draco
Malfoy) main characters, although the faculty of Hogwarts remains a
Who's Who in British theater. Alan Rickman's delicious Professor
Snape gets less screen time, but the addition of Kenneth Branagh as
the new defense against the dark arts instructor, Gilderoy Lockhart,
and Jason Isaacs as Draco's reptilian father, Lucius, may placate
adult audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "The first movie, I wanted more Alan Rickman," Columbus said. "The
second movie, I wanted more Alan Rickman. But we focused on the
story, which follows the kids."</TE>
<TE>   A sense of continuity</TE>
<TE>   Having a core cast of young actors creates logistical problems for
any movie -- minors can only film four hours a day. Using the same
core cast of young actors for a series of films adds another twist --
biology. When plans for the first movie were announced, the idea was
that there would be a film a year and the cast would age along with
the characters. So it isn't all that surprising to find that Ron and
Harry have deeper voices than in "The Sorcerer's Stone" or that
Hermione's face is not quite as round.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect growth spurts," Heyman said. "The trouble is when they
occur in the middle of shooting, because we don't shoot in sequence.
I don't think the audience will notice," he said of several early
scenes in which the actors seem a bit older than in later scenes,
"but of course I do."</TE>
<TE>   Heyman and Columbus quickly scotched rumors that the third movie,
"The Prisoner of Azakban," was to be re-cast. But many plans have
changed in recent months -- the nifty idea of a film a year is out
(the third movie won't begin shooting until early next year and will
be released in 2004), the recent death of Richard Harris will
necessitate recasting of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, and Columbus is
turning over his director's chair to Alfonso Cuaron ("Little
Princess," "Y Tu Mama Tambien") for the third film. To ensure a
gentle transition for the young actors, he will remain on the set as
a producer until at least June. Columbus bowed out, he said, because
he felt he had given his all to "Chamber of Secrets." Cuaron will
bring a new eye and sensibility to the series. "You'll see new magic
at Hogwarts," Heyman said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, on the other hand, has no plans to step down, and he
really couldn't even if he wanted to -- the main action of all three
movies was shot all at once, over 14 months (from October 1999 to
December 2000), and mostly in sequence.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he and his team have holed up in Wellington, New
Zealand (dubbed "Wellywood" by the locals), editing and adding sound,
doing a tiny bit of re-shooting and, of course, filling in all the
special effects. For "The Two Towers," this includes the
computer-enhanced characters of Gollum and Treebeard, the destruction
of Isengard and several jaw-dropping battle scenes. The success of
the first movie assured him he was doing something right. As "The
Fellowship" was edited, there had been much anguish expressed by
Tolkien fans who learned, through Internet rumor, of this cut or
that. But when the film came out, there was very little criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "I think even the hard-core fans understood that the two things
[the film and the book] are very different," Jackson said. "I think
they realized we weren't stomping all over the essence of it, that we
were being respectful."</TE>
<TE>   The trust issue is crucial because Jackson and co-writers Frances
Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair took even more liberties
in "The Two Towers." They excavated the love story between Aragorn
and Arwen from the book's appendices and made it a centerpiece, and
the movie will end in a different place than did the book. (For those
familiar with the work, Shelob will not make her big entrance until
the third and final film, "The Return of the King.")</TE>
<TE>   The trilogy, Jackson has pointed out many times, was actually
written as a single book -- a paper shortage led to the decision to
publish it as three volumes. The new ending, he said, is actually
truer, chronologically, to the tale than the book. But if the fans
seem content, some folks not familiar with Tolkien's work had a few
issues this time around. Last year, a petition was posted on the
Internet, asking Jackson to change the name of the film, "The Two
Towers" being, according to the petition's author, "clearly meant to
refer to the attacks on the World Trade Center." The page with the
petition, which has been suspended due to lack of maintenance, also
includes a note from the Web site, PetitonOnline .com, explaining
that the literary classic was published 47 years prior to the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't just Web surfers who had issues. Earlier this year,
New Line proposed making its New York premiere of "The Two Towers" a
benefit similar to the one held for "The Fellowship of the Ring,"
which raised $300,000 for the Twin Towers Fund. But the organizations
they approached got cold feet.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, they thought the name of the film was too close,"
said New Line head Robert Shaye. There was, he said, a conversation
about changing the film's name. "Not going to happen," he said
flatly.</TE>
<TE>   The Harry Potter domain was also assailed, albeit unsuccessfully,
this year -- a U.S. federal judge rejected a claim that Rowling stole
the word "muggle" from another writer, and the campaign claiming that
the author and the films promote witchcraft and, by extension, Satan
worship, seems to have died down.</TE>
<TE>   But the thing that concerns the studios the most is whether the
films can meet the expectations set by their predecessors. Industry
insiders are betting not on whether the two movies will be hits, but
which will be the bigger hit. The money seems to be on "The Two
Towers" this time.</TE>
<TE>   "We are cautiously optimistic," Shaye said.</TE>
<TE>   Which seems a sensible approach. As Harry and Frodo know only too
well, it's when things are nice and quiet that the monsters jump out
of the shadows.</TE>

<HD>An impetuous Brit's lessons in privacy, gunslinging and
love</HD>
<DH>Charlie Hunnam, 22, seen in 'Undeclared' and 'Queer as
Folk,' now gets bigger roles, eschews fame and has mixed spontaneity
and romance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter McQuaid</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charlie Hunnam, 22, is trying to adjust to celebrity. "We were on
location making 'Nicholas Nickleby' in Yorkshire for two weeks, and I
have this issue with my privacy and people going through my stuff. So
we check into this hotel, and the next day, I'm going off to work,
and I put all my stuff in my bag and I shove the bag under the desk.</LD>
<LD>   "I get home that night and I have a shower and go to my bag to get
some clothes, and someone has been through my clothes," he says, and,
worse, his bottled water "is standing up in my bag with no cap on,
and I'm freaked, and furious."</LD>
<LD>   As for possible motivations of the perpetrator, he inventories a
few creepy-to-contemplate scenarios that are probably numbingly
familiar to any actor who looks like him, not to mention one whose
first big career boost happened to be playing a sexually precocious
teenager with lots of sex scenes on a landmark British TV series
charting the life of several gay men.</LD>
<TE>   "So I tear the room apart" to see if anything important is missing
and "looking for the cap for the bottle and it's nowhere to be found
and now I'm completely furious, and I go downstairs and complain to
the management," whose only response was to offer to clean his
clothes. Hunnam demurred, instead referring them to his lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Well.</TE>
<TE>   "You really opened a Pandora's box with that one!" he says,
laughing. The precipitating question: Are you adjusting to celebrity?</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the garden of a West Hollywood tea emporium, Hunnam,
despite his tale of temper, comes across as exceedingly affable,
although if you were expecting Hugh Grant, be advised.... He drives
an enormous, jacked-up Chevy SUV. He pulls U-turns in the middle of
Melrose Avenue. Today, his hair is a blond bird's nest under a navy
watch cap, his exquisitely boned face partially obscured by blond
scrub, his tatty jeans riding somewhere just north of his knees,
waistline holding on for dear life thanks to a belt and an enormous
T-shirt. It is clear this is one Brit who has gone completely native.
This is also one of those young men who has absolutely no need to
spend even a minute on his appearance. He's that good looking.</TE>
<TE>   The only hint that this d-u-u-de gives of his European breeding is
an exquisitely tailored navy blazer over this very SoCal act -- or
ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Considering his career trajectory, Hunnam has every reason to be
affable. His first "real job," at 17, was in the original British
production of "Queer as Folk," in which he played the aforementioned
teen in an affair with a 29-year-old. After that came British indies
and then, at 18, Hunnam decided to try his luck in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   It was tough, he says. "I had a BMX push-bike to get around. That,
and the bus, and a lot of walking."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it wasn't long before he was cast as a British lady killer in
last year's critically acclaimed Fox network series "Undeclared," set
on a college campus.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the series lasted only one season, which may have
had something to do with why he married Katharine Towne after knowing
her for only three weeks. "We were all friends on 'Undeclared' and I
was going back to England and my wife and I were afraid we'd lose
touch, and we got married as something of a lark -- well, no, I don't
think marriage is a lark, but we figured that way we wouldn't lose
touch and we'd definitely have to see each other if for no other
reason than to get divorced at some point."</TE>
<TE>   He tries to weigh his words carefully, describing an incredibly
impetuous act that maybe didn't feel that impetuous at the time, and,
well, it just seems like hindsight is the only vision that's
guaranteed 20/20. Especially when you're only 22.</TE>
<TE>   While his divorce is pending, he and his wife are really good
friends, he says, and get together about once a week. "It's very
amicable."</TE>
<TE>   Once his stint with "Undeclared" came to an end, Hunnam landed a
role as a blue-blooded American fink in the psychological thriller
"Abandon," with Katie Holmes and Benjamin Bratt. It's quite a
contrast to the kindhearted Nicholas Nickleby, and Hunnam admits he
found it somewhat difficult to play the unbelievably magnanimous
Dickensian hero. "I was hired to give the character something of a
modern flair," he explains. And he does.</TE>
<TE>   The production, a lush, though somewhat truncated, version of
Dickens' epic tale of pluck and decency triumphing over power and
money, is a warmhearted "Perils of Pauline," with a cast including
Christopher Plummer, Jim Broadbent, Nathan Lane, Alan Cumming and
Barry Humphries, a.k.a. Dame Edna. Scripted and directed by Douglas
McGrath, the film features the most villainous villains, the most
theatrical theatricals, the most heroic heroes; in other words, it's
utter holiday fare.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Hunnam is off to Transylvania for six months, where
director Anthony Minghella has re-created a Civil War-era Carolina
village for "Cold Mountain." Again, Hunnam finds himself in the
company of serious heavyweights, among them Nicole Kidman, Giovanni
Ribisi and Renee Zellweger.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about the people who were left behind in the villages during
the Civil War and how they coped," he explains. "I play an albino
gunfighter who everyone is afraid of a bit but who they won't let
fight in the war. So it became our job to safeguard the women and
property and also to kill any deserters who came along."</TE>
<TE>   For this, he has not only been studying gunslinging (and growing
an extremely long pinky nail "for snuff"), he also has been studying
gymnastics. "I had to learn how to do back flips and all that," he
explains -- no small feat for someone nearly 6 feet tall. Hunnam, who
has never formally studied acting, credits his instructor, Michael
Cates of Broadway Gymnastics in Venice, for showing him -- "Just do
this, and then this, and it will be fine."</TE>
<TE>   "And it was!" exclaims the actor, somewhat incredulously, of the
flip he executed on his first try.</TE>
<TE>   Why are we not surprised?</TE>

<HD>Reflections of Almodovar's life</HD>
<DH>Calling it the 'most intimate film I've done,' the Spanish
director offers a revealing glimpse of himself in his latest effort,
'Talk to Her.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If he had been director John Ford, Pedro Almodovar says, he would
have had John Wayne cry in "The Searchers." Grown men -- even cowboys
who strut -- should cry, the Spanish director contends. It may be
embarrassing, but releasing tears provides a certain catharsis, he
says.</LD>
<LD>   There are tears aplenty in "Talk to Her," his latest movie, which
offers a revealing glimpse into a somewhat more restrained, pensive,
mature Almodovar -- a side he says was once repressed by his wilder,
more baroque alter ego.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the most intimate film I've done," he said in an interview
in Los Angeles. "I show really sentimental men, and it's something
that has to do with me directly. It embarrasses me to talk about it,
actually. I show things about myself in this movie that I have never
shown before."</LD>
<TE>   Mainly, the film is about the comfort of words in combating
loneliness, sickness and madness. It is also unabashedly about men
who cry. This may seem a departure for a man more frequently
associated with films distinguished by surreal flourishes, eccentric
characters in colorful settings and outrageous behavior -- and it is.</TE>
<TE>   What Almodovar has also been known for, however, is his
perspective on women in and out of relationships and his direction of
female actors. That talent is on full display in "Talk to Her," as
are his characteristic visual flair and subversively witty jabs at
the media. But the focus has shifted, ever so subtly, to men.</TE>
<TE>   Starring Javier Camara, Dario Grandinetti, Leonor Watling, Rosario
Flores and Geraldine Chaplin, the film is a complex web of stories
involving two couples. All the characters seem confined to a terrible
loneliness (the film originally was going to be titled "Solitude, I
Suppose") until they manage to find each other. The men are
emotionally crippled, but they eventually find contentment by talking
to the women in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   And here lies one typically Almodovarian quirk -- the men's
so-called partners are in a comatose state, with their sides of the
story revealed in flashbacks. And the manner in which one character
shows his love is -- without giving anything away -- deranged. The
women offer the men comfort and give their lives meaning without
speaking one word, at least in the present.</TE>
<TE>   Almodovar said the seed for this story was planted when he saw a
photo of the great Spanish novelist and dadaist Ramon Gomez de la
Serna sitting on a comfortable couch with his "partner" -- a
mannequin that was bejeweled, dressed to the nines and that would
"receive" guests at home at the writer's side. That image, and the
famous Chilean Pablo Neruda's "Poem 15," which loosely translated
reads: "I like you when you are silent because you seem to be
absent," served as inspirations. Their essence is of a woman with
such a powerful presence that she does not need to talk to make an
impression.</TE>
<TE>   Although some might see this as a commentary on sexual politics,
that was not Almodovar's intent. His interpretation is much more
poetic. The film goes out of its way to be nonjudgmental -- even
though his characters are deeply flawed, even psychologically
damaged.</TE>
<TE>   He went so far as to only allude to a disturbing scene between one
man and his comatose partner in a silent movie within the film.</TE>
<TE>   He could not bring himself to portray the act in question, he
says. "I couldn't watch it happen," Almodovar said while drinking
herbal tea in his bungalow at a Los Angeles hotel. "It's like when
you have a terrific friendship with someone and you don't want to
talk about their bad side. I have a very good relationship with the
character."</TE>
<TE>   Although his work is as sensitively and acutely observant as ever,
it seems that the 51-year-old director has come to a personal and
career crossroads. Winning an Oscar two years ago for "All About My
Mother" had a strange effect.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than going for the big-budget Hollywood movies dangled
before him, he retreated into what felt familiar.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of becoming more ambitious, I have become more restrained
and reflective," he said. "I decided I was going to do the opposite
of 'All About My Mother.' I was afraid that with that movie's
success, 'Talk to Her' would suffer from comparisons. Fortunately,
this movie ... is so different it is not seen in competition."</TE>
<TE>   The death of his own mother a few months after the release of "All
About My Mother" also brought some gravity into his life that
influenced "Talk to Her." The film is also a reflection of the
director's continuing need to redefine and challenge himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to explore new things," he said. "I'm saturated with the
Almodovar of 10 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Today's Almodovar is older, and physically a little heavier,
although he admittedly is still gregarious and a lover of life.</TE>
<TE>   But on this cloudy October day, clad in black, Almodovar shows
signs of weariness. He has been plugging his film for the last week
in the United States and has been worn down by the flu. He also is
recording a narration for the film's DVD release. When he emerges
after two hours of talking to a microphone in an editing suite, he is
perspiring and has bags under his eyes. He confides that he is
claustrophobic and hates the enclosure of the sound room. He also is
wary of the press and would rather never be photographed.</TE>
<TE>   While recording the DVD narration, he pokes fun at the
"tele-basura" (tele-trash) dominating the airwaves in Spain, which he
has skewered in a few scenes in the movie. He also takes a swipe at
the paparazzi. In one scene, a photographer intrudes to grab a shot
of one of the characters in an extremely intimate moment -- she is
near death after being gored by a bull.</TE>
<TE>   "Something more brutal than the bull -- the camera -- grabs her in
her most mortal moment," he said as he was recording material for the
DVD. But this comment is also a reflection of his own continuing
struggle with faith, with God and the trauma of growing up with a
strict Catholic education.</TE>
<TE>   "I have problems with faith," he said. "Suddenly, God can send you
a bull that rips you in half and throws you in the hospital." This
sense of mortality and fate were common threads in both "All About My
Mother" and "Talk to Her."</TE>
<TE>   His films are also distinguished for their repertoire of Spanish
actresses, including Carmen Maura, Veronica Forque, Marisa Paredes,
Victoria Abril, Cecilia Roth and Penelope Cruz, but the principal
cast of "Talk to Her" had never appeared in an Almodovar film. And
the main love story involves two men whose bond is emotional and
spiritual, but not physical.</TE>
<TE>   While moments of levity liberally punctuate "Talk to Her," it is
by far his most serious work.</TE>
<TE>   At premieres in Europe, many in the audience -- including
journalists -- were left speechless by the film's multilayered
emotionality. French actress Jeanne Moreau said to Chaplin at the
Paris premiere that she could not make it to the after-party because
the film had left her in a reflective, solitary mood.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me she had to go home and think about the film," Chaplin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Almodovar said he loves to hear this reaction. "I don't gain
pleasure in having the person be catatonic and unable to speak
afterwards," he said, but to him their silence indicates something
deep occurred. "It means that the movie has a big impact on the
person's spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Even though he is more introspective nowadays, he is no less
mischievous. He delights in dropping zingers -- full of wry
commentary -- into his films. He also sports two perfectly colored
shocks of white hair that, from a distance, look like horns,
protruding from his thick, black hair.</TE>
<TE>   He promises his next film, "La Mala Educacion" (A Bad Education),
will be tough on the church and very anticlerical, a reaction to his
upbringing. "I remember that time in my life as a nightmare. It was
one of the darkest periods."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is such an abiding spirituality in "Talk to Her," it
is hard to believe the Catholic influence doesn't remain in him.
Although "Talk to Her" addresses serious issues such as death,
illness and psychosis, it is not a downbeat story. The movie
concludes on a note of hope and forgiveness -- one that reflects
Almodovar's beliefs about life.</TE>
<TE>   Always looking forward, he is a restless spirit who takes no
comfort in the past. Maybe, he says, in the twilight of his years, he
will be able to reflect on what has been.</TE>
<TE>   "I am afraid that this unease with enjoying what I have done in
the past -- which is part of my character -- will keep me from
enjoying what I have accomplished," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The real moment of my maturation will come when I can look behind
me and feel like what I have done can keep me company, build my
memories and give me pleasure."</TE>

<LD>One of the most popular and internationally significant Spanish
directors since Luis Bunuel, Almodovar has made bawdy, colorful
movies about people on the fringes of society. A few highlights:</LD>
<LD>   Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls on the Heap (1980) Packed with
sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, the comedy was the director's first
commercial feature-length film. Blown up from 8 millimeter to 35 mm,
it was shot while Almodovar worked at the phone company. Budget:
$5,000.</LD>
<LD>   What Have I Done to Deserve This? (1984) Almodovar's first major
hit tells the story of a speed-addicted cleaning woman who sells her
12-year-old son to a lecherous dentist and kills her husband with a
frozen ham.</LD>
<TE>   Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988) A zany portrayal
of a pregnant TV soap opera actress whose married lover dumps her.
Taking in a relatively hefty $7 million in the U.S. and Canada, it
was voted best foreign language film by the New York Film Critics
Circle and drew an Oscar nomination in that category.</TE>
<TE>   Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) A controversial film about a former
mental patient who abducts a former porn film actress, ties her to a
bed and waits for her to fall in love with him.</TE>
<TE>   Todo Sobre Mi Madre/All About My Mother (1999) A woman seeking the
long-lost father of her dead son becomes the center of a circle of
women that includes a wayward nun, an old transvestite friend and a
famous actress. Winner of the director's prize at the Cannes Film
Festival and an Oscar for best foreign language film.</TE>

<HD>Riffs on life, in the key of Jack</HD>
<DH>The star of 'About Schmidt' expounds on the twists and
turns of growing older. And, oh, the director has a thing or two to
say too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rachel Abramowitz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Nicholson inhales a steady stream of cigarettes as if fumigating
his brain, and runs his hands through what remains of his hair,
giving the longish salt-and-pepper locks a vaguely "Shining" air.
Dressed in khakis and a blue sweatshirt, the 65-year-old star is
settled into a velvety leopard-skin-print chair (Jack's apparent
equivalent of the Barcalounger) in his longtime lair high atop
Mulholland Drive. He's been in this unpretentious womb-like ranch
house for 30 years, and Picassos and Bacons compete for attention
with jumbles of pictures of his kids and friends.</LD>
<LD>   Across from him is Alexander Payne, the Omaha native who so
memorably co-wrote and directed the satires "Citizen Ruth,"
"Election" and the upcoming film "About Schmidt," in which Nicholson
plays the title character. At 41, Payne resembles a schoolboy in gray
pants, a navy pullover and a pristine white shirt.</LD>
<TE>   This interview is supposed to be a two-hander, but Nicholson has
the gravitational pull of Jupiter, and Payne, who describes himself
as "laconic," sits back and lets his star indulge his merry instinct
to entertain. Nicholson approaches conversation like a gourmand --
each juicy tidbit, anecdote and Jack-ism presented as a delicious
idiosyncratic morsel, in what turns out to be a banquet touching on
everything from Winston Churchill to his all-time favorite bad movies
-- one of which, "Serpent of the Nile" (1953)he incongruously leaps
up to act out.</TE>
<TE>   His patter, delivered in his idiosyncratic inflections of irony
and delight, brings back all the messy inquisitiveness of the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the 90-minute discussion is not unlike the film
they're here to talk about, in which a gray-faced, tubby Nicholson
dominates the screen in what seems destined to be another
Oscar-nominated performance. Yet his paunchy pyrotechnics wouldn't be
possible without the dryly witty, self-effacing world so tightly
constructed by Payne. Nicholson might be the match, but he's been
ignited in pure oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   The film is a satire about a 67-year-old former insurance actuary
who discovers that his life has no meaning. The newly retired and
widowed Schmidt tools aimlessly around the cows and the Dairy Queens
of the Midwest in a super-sized Winnebago. He visits childhood haunts
and local sites of dubious interest, and ultimately ends up at the
wedding of his churlish daughter, who's marrying a pea-brain waterbed
salesman he disdains. His only hope for intimacy lies in the long,
heartfelt letters he writes to Ngudu, an illiterate African orphan
whom he's "adopted" for $22 a month through a TV charity.</TE>
<TE>   The movie is ostensibly based on the novel by Louis Begley, though
it derives most of its thrust from an original script co-written by
Payne (and Jim Taylor) about a decade ago, as he was emerging from
UCLA film school. "This was supposed to be my first feature," says
Payne. "Somehow a guy retiring in a crisis, kind of like Benjamin
Braddock in 'The Graduate,' but different and in Omaha."</TE>
<TE>   It's a comedy about obliviousness. "If I wanted to key in what
this piece is about," says Nicholson, laughing, "a guy goes to his
best friend having discovered that his friend had an affair with his
wife some long while ago, and at first his best friend doesn't
remember. That's key to know."</TE>
<TE>   You announced at the Cannes Film Festival that this was your least
vain performance.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: I didn't hide any of the real things about me. After
all, I'm actually this age. The comb-over was my original piece of
inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   Do you usually hide things about how you look?</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: Yes, of course you do. It's not necessarily hiding.
It's more shaping. All of these things you learn intuitively about
the graphic image of the big silver. Early on, I used to say you have
to understand when you smile, it's eight Buicks in a drive-in
theater. All the adjectives that deal with shaping -- look sharp,
thin, wise, chiseled -- I just didn't do that. It's challenging to
your vanity.</TE>
<TE>   What was the hardest to give up?</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: [He sinks low in his chair in a slouch that gives him
the appearance of a double chin.] Not to worry when you're sitting in
a chair or low angle.. I can't tell you how many offstage discussions
I've watched about how do we shoot the couple flat in the bed without
either propping them up or shooting up their noses.</TE>
<TE>   Payne: You talked about the process you were taught. I don't know
if it was Jeff Corey [Nicholson's acting teacher] who said it, "When
an actor takes on a part, he or she should feel free to assume they
have 85% in common with them."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: Not "in common" -- synonymous. Man, woman or child, 85%
of you is exactly like the character you're playing, and isolating
the other 15% and deciding how to act it is beginning the analysis.
And the 85% that is you is the main element of all acting -- which is
relaxation so you're not overwhelmed by the tension and pressure of
acting.</TE>
<TE>   Payne: It's very liberating.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: Another thing Jeff always said, if you can't drop the
character within 10 minutes after you've done the performance, then
you're in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Payne: Why?</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: You're invested psychically in it in a way that' s not
good for you as a person.</TE>
<TE>   Is Nicholson different when he's working?</TE>
<TE>   Payne: On "Schmidt," he was by his own admission depressed a lot,
like the character. He was quieter than usual, a little more dour.
When he finished shooting, he did feel a weight begin to lift from
his shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: If you're depressed and the scene you're going to be
playing is about that, there's no point in unacting yourself and then
having to act your way back in.</TE>
<TE>   (to Nicholson) You've done a lot of movies recently -- "As Good as
It Gets," "The Crossing Guard," this one -- that deal with a man's
inability to connect.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: It's more about the literature of my age group than it
is about me. I always had an idea that as an actor I wanted to in
some way reinvest, let's not call it old age, let's call it latter
middle age, with an honest sexual component. Underline "honest"
rather than "sexual." I thought that was an element in movies that's
really never comfortably dealt with. Superstructurally.</TE>
<TE>   What do you mean, "superstructurally"?</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: I know how I feel inside. I'm not Judge Hardy. There's
[an assumption in Hollywood] that it would be unattractive for anyone
over 60 years old to be an outwardly sexual person. One of the most
memorable moments of Laurence Olivier's career, to me, came in a bad
movie called "The Betsy." In England, if they're not Welsh, they're
actors very light in the sexual area, and in this it's a long shot
through a door to a bed and Olivier like an old satyr in a tuxedo
over his son's bride -- [he describes the sex act in graphic detail]
-- on the bed, just before the wedding. It's just that one shot and
baby, I believed it! It's one of the most memorable moments in his
career for me. I'm a McLuhan baby. When you break a cliche, you
release all the energy that's been held within that.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, there is an underlying sadness in many of these films.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: It's always about what's written. I could be in a
thriller, and be the horrible judge or general this, but it's all
specific vocations related to melodrama. Once you're reading in other
areas, you're dealing with this stuff. I read a lot, and I'm really
alerted to the very limited nature of the stories about people who
are towards, let's call them autumnal, years of life. This is a long
way of saying the old saying there are no third acts in American
life. There's a futility, generationally. Payne: [He's gone back to
his car to get a piece of paper. Earlier in the week, Payne
introduced Nicholson and his 1971 film, "Drive, He Said," at a
special screening.] In preparation, I read a bunch of reviews of
"Drive, She Said." I just had them ready.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: In case I failed you.</TE>
<TE>   Payne: [quoting] "There's an aura of profound despair about
Nicholson's work. His universe, though it fills with positive
possibilities, remains bleak because his characters have no chance of
latching on to something secure."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: [laughs] That was the kind of answer I didn't want to
give! Every time in the old Roger Corman movies, the view I got, I'd
be the young James Stewart, or the young this or that. ... Then in my
early 30s, it was the premature balding wrinkled guy ... then the
symbol of alienation. There is always this kind of schematic. What is
the view? It's one scene at a time, really! I've always worked with
really fine directors who as a group, they're about the truth!</TE>
<TE>   This is about a man who regrets the decision of his life. Do you
have any regrets?</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: [Slowly and emphatically, he blows out smoke before
answering.] Not really. There are areas that I wished I functioned
better in or things I might have known sooner that might have changed
my behavior. Or maybe I shot off my mouth too many times. But not
major regrets. I'm very proud of the fact that I've worked in the
movies for a long time and no one can ever come to me that I worked
with and say that I lied or cheated them. I love the people in show
business. I can't think of any other life I might have functioned in
other than show business.</TE>
<TE>   (to Payne) Do you like show business?</TE>
<TE>   Payne: I don't know enough about show business to know if I like
it or not. I like my corner of it. I like movies. I 'm so happy to be
born in the century where movies were invented. I can't tell you how
many times I think of all those people who lived and died and never
had movies.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: This is basically what movies are -- the learning
process. Education. We learn how to kiss, or to drink, talk to our
buddies. All the things that you can't really teach in social studies
or history, we all learn them at the movies.</TE>
<TE>   For you, what movies were instructive?</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: I don't know if I could put [it] in movies but I could
put [it] in scenes from old movies. When Lawrence is talking to Alec
Guinness in "Lawrence of Arabia" and they're having this big argument
about what should be done and who should do it, and Guinness turns
and says, "Look, Lawrence, you do things according to your real and
honest passions of the moment, I do things according to the way in
which they should be done traditionally. I ask you to judge which is
more trustworthy over the long run." I love that scene.</TE>
<TE>   Is it different working with a director from a younger generation?</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: I don't want to think about Alexander as a younger
director because then I have to start thinking about myself as an
older person. Philosophically, I try to live in the now. That's the
closest I have to a philosophy or a religion. Alex's attitude on set
is that it's a privilege to get to direct a movie. It's very
hard-minded. He always takes the actor aside and tells them a little
thing and there's a lot of it. He's really watches. He doesn't watch
the TelePrompTer. It's fun to have a director there when you're doing
it. But there's not a lot of conceptual arguments but a lot of
tuning.</TE>
<TE>   Payne: I just want to see a human cinema. I want to see real
Americans represented and I don't see that too much in the movies
today.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: To a lot of people, Alex is one of them, human
frailties are seen everywhere you look. This doesn't lead you to
despise the people. You see it, but there's not a meanness about it.</TE>
<TE>   There seem to be a number of movies made this season about
masculinity under siege? Why do you think that is?</TE>
<TE>   Payne: I have no idea.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: The white male is the target for everybody culturally.
It's obvious. You can't almost use the phrase without being suspect
in some way. ["About Schmidt"] is more [than that]. This could be
about anybody. Mendacity -- this is our problem. "About Schmidt" is
about America. I just came downstairs [and turned on the TV] and the
world is now obsessed with this sniper situation in Washington, D.C.
My inner response was "Holy God, I'm very aware of it, but somehow
it's on the East Coast. We're not as worried about the sniper as much
as they are in Washington." It's that isolationist nature of our
country that makes us mendacious. We hold facts so tightly but for so
short a period of time. People are really changing their minds
publicly a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Why is that mendacious and not simply indecisive?</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson: Everyone dissembles. You know that. We tend to think
what's best for us is best for everyone else, and it's like a child,
you can't help but state the case to your own advantage. We're
mendacious because we want things our way. We don't want anybody to
want nuclear weapons. That's good for the world, but we have them.</TE>
<TE>   I'm an old peacenik. That's why I'm doing a lot of comedy. Bring
on the clowns. I know I don't know anything. That's my one advantage.</TE>

<LD>One of the startling sights in "About Schmidt" comes when Jack
Nicholson appears beside June Squibb, who plays his wife. Squibb is
67 to Nicholson's 65, a significant departure for an actor who, on
screen and off, prefers the company of younger women.</LD>
<LD>   After an early age-appropriate marriage to Sandra Knight and some
peer-to-peer long-term relationships, the actor hooked up with
Anjelica Huston (14 years younger), Rebecca Broussard (26 years
younger) and Lara Flynn Boyle (33 years younger). Here's how
Nicholson compares with some recent co-stars.</LD>

<HD>Adults only (almost)</HD>
<DH>Sure there'll be fare for the family, but this is primarily
the season for grown-ups.</DH>

<AU>Lauren Sandler</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If summer movies come on like a Dramamine-popping day at Six Flags,
holiday films are often more of a year-end cocktail party, where
familiar figures in little black dresses and sharp suits chitchat
about the book review over glasses of mulled wine. At the end of the
year, brows lift themselves higher, metaphor replaces pyrotechnics,
and the film world's annual progression from adolescence to adulthood
finds us more sophisticated.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it's the introspection that comes with longer nights and
darker days. Or, more likely, it could be the proximity to Oscar
time. But all this is to your advantage if the testosterone-fueled
explosions of "XXX" and its brethren left you feeling like the
derivative Holden Caulfield characters of this fall's small films
(those movies don't understand who you really are). You might easily
see your reflection in the golden eye of this season's offerings,
snuggling up under your boarding-school-issue tartan blanket to read
Woolf or Dickens, and losing yourself in 19th century history, or
fantasies of a Bond girl (but not just any Bond girl -- it would have
to be Halle Berry, the only one who can tuck her Oscar next to the
gun in her garter holster).</LD>
<TE>   This season, you've got a library-meets-the-Cineplex roundup in
the forms of "Harry Potter," "The Emperor's Club," "The Hours,"
"Nicholas Nickleby," "Gangs of New York" and, of course, Ian
Fleming's dashing immortal spy to look forward to, just to name a
few. In winter, the higher the brow, the higher the potential gross
among people who in summer won't indulge exploding planes and
bullet-dodging kung fu.</TE>
<TE>   Many studios also consider the holidays the zenith of the
family-uplift market. Just consider the number of child-friendly
franchises hitting theaters by New Year's, from the return of Tim
Allen in his second "Santa Clause" flick to the rich, mystical moods
of "The Lord of the Rings."</TE>
<TE>   But just ask a market sample of adult children how they feel about
spending the holidays stuck inside the homes they fled at age 18.For
many, the holiday season represents each year's heyday of familial
dysfunction -- that unavoidable dash of cyanide swirled into the
eggnog. It's easy to see that our winter moviegoer might be
entertained by a reminder that someone is even nuttier than they are.</TE>
<TE>   Want relief from the family madness? Get into the heads of not one
but two schizophrenics (played by Ralph Fiennes in David Cronenberg's
"Spider" and Spalding Gray in "Revolution No. 9"). Think now might be
a good time to taper off the Zoloft? You'll think again when you see
the brutal reality Christian Bale discovers in the futuristic
thriller "Equilibrium."</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the extremities</TE>
<TE>   There's a simple financial explanation to why the long, dark films
tend to accompany long, dark days. Huge-budget films have three
months to make their money back in the summer -- months when, as
Lions Gate President Tom Ortenberg explains, "for every college and
high school student, every night is a Saturday night, and this is a
group that spends their Saturday nights at the movies."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the holidays deliver only a couple of seven-day
weekends to rake in ticket sales, so smaller, less teen-dependent
films are produced for those times. "Summer movies have come to be
the bullies that have pushed everyone else to the extremities," says
Village Voice film critic Michael Atkinson.</TE>
<TE>   So here we are at the extremities. And those of you who have been
waiting for the offbeat or Oscar-contending movies you'd like to be
seeing all year, those whose fantasies diverge from the typical
summer fare of rippling abs and pyrotechnics, will find the holidays
offering new gifts each week.</TE>
<TE>   This season allows grown-ups to daydream of using their wits to
outsmart the FBI, like Leonardo DiCaprio in Steven Spielberg's "Catch
Me if You Can," or to survive the Holocaust, like Adrien Brody in
Roman Polanski's Cannes-winning "The Pianist."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the fantasy is of writing your own screenplay -- an easy bet
in this city -- perhaps one based on a book, as in "Adaptation," the
dizzyingly postmodern film about Charlie Kaufman's ("Being John
Malkovich") attempt to bring a New Yorker author's book to the
screen, with Nicolas Cage playing the script scribe paralyzed with
writer's-blocking neurosis.</TE>
<TE>   If you think it's hard to find a good movie to see, just try
writing one.</TE>

<LD>Two major holiday releases -- "Gangs of New York" and "The Hours" --
have gone through multiple composers on their way to theaters.</LD>
<LD>   The most widely talked-about change has been on Martin Scorsese's
long-delayed "Gangs" for which Elmer Bernstein (the Oscar-winning
composer of "The Magnificent Seven" and "To Kill a Mockingbird")
wrote and recorded an entire score. The Bernstein-Scorsese
relationship dates to 1990, when the composer scored the
Scorsese-produced "The Grifters." He went on to adapt Bernard
Herrmann's original "Cape Fear" score for Scorsese's 1991 remake and
write original music for the director's 1993 "The Age of Innocence"
(which earned him an Oscar nomination) and 1999's "Bringing Out the
Dead."</LD>
<LD>   Bernstein said that he worked with Scorsese over a period of
several months late last year and earlier this year prior to
recording the music in London. Afterward, Scorsese became
"uncommunicative" until Bernstein received a letter "in which he
basically said that he had decided he would do this as a typical
Scorsese score, meaning bits and pieces that he puts together, as he
did in 'GoodFellas' and 'Casino.' "</LD>
<TE>   Miramax officials confirmed that there is no longer any Bernstein
music in the film. Howard Shore (who worked on Scorsese's "After
Hours" and recently won an Oscar for "The Lord of the Rings") has
contributed music based on a previously unheard concert work,
"Brooklyn Heights."</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese has also borrowed music from a recent album by Peter
Gabriel (who scored the director's "Last Temptation of Christ") and
rock group U2 has written "The Hands That Built America."</TE>
<TE>   Three composers wrote music for director Stephen Daldry's "The
Hours," including Oscar winner Stephen Warbeck ("Shakespeare in
Love"), who had scored Daldry's "Billy Elliot," and British composer
Michael Nyman ("The Piano"). They were succeeded by Philip Glass, who
has become more active in films lately with an Oscar nomination for
"Kundun" and a Golden Globe for "The Truman Show." Said producer
Scott Rudin: "We demo'ed the movie with Philip Glass' music and
nothing else came close."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every composer in films has had at least one score
replaced. Some of the most celebrated have had scores tossed,
including Herrmann ("Torn Curtain"), Alex North ("2001: A Space
Odyssey") and Sir William Walton ("The Battle of Britain").</TE>
<TE>   Veteran film-music agent Richard Kraft, a partner in the Blue
Focus Agency, commented: "Filmmakers change composers for reasons as
varied as why people change wives: Sometimes it's a bad relationship,
sometimes it's because you're heading in a different direction, and
sometimes you're just fickle and can't be satisfied with anybody.
Having a score thrown out is not the end of the world, or the end of
a career. It happens to the best of them."</TE>

<LD>Equipped with British accents, rotten childhoods, spy-mobiles,
super-sized shoulder pads and whipping sticks, a new swarm of
villains will try to make life miserable for heroes of the season's
big sequels.</LD>
<LD>   Audiences hated Jason Isaacs as cruel Col. William Tavington in
"The Patriot"; the English actor hopes they'll feel the same way
about Lucius Malfoy in "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"
(Nov. 15).</LD>
<LD>   Lucius, abusive father to nasty Hogwarts student Draco Malfoy (Tom
Felton), wants to keep Wizard bloodlines "pure" and despises
half-mortal interloper Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Originally,
Lucius had short gray hair and a suit. Isaacs wanted to have more fun
than that, so he convinced director Chris Columbus to let Lucius have
long blond hair, "floor-length ermine and fur and velvet and a
walking cane."</LD>
<TE>   "Die Another Day" (Nov. 22) casts Rick Yune as Zao, a political
operative trying to unify North and South Korea. Mottled with battle
scars, Zao changes his identity, drives a gadget-loaded Jaguar and
battles James Bond in Iceland. "This film is about how the world is
no longer black and white," says Yune, who also played the heavy in
"The Fast and the Furious." "If you look at Taiwan, North and South
Korea, Hong Kong, the Middle East, it depends on what side of the
fence you're on to say what's right or wrong."</TE>
<TE>   In "Star Trek: Nemesis" (Dec. 13), British Method actor Tom Hardy
("Band of Brothers") plays Shinzon, the Romulan slave-turned-emperor
who's been cloned from Picard (Patrick Stewart) and needs a fresh
infusion of the Enterprise commander's DNA. "I don't know any clones
myself," Hardy explains wryly, "so you hit a dead end with that sort
of research."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Hardy: "He's a monster, but he's also a product of
circumstances who's deeply in pain."</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Lee returns in "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"
(Dec. 18) as evil Saruman with a creepy new minion: Wormtongue.
Played by Brad Dourif -- he gave voice to the homicidal doll Chucky
in "Child's Play" -- Grima Wormtongue weakens King Theoden (Bernard
Hill) with his poisonous counsel.</TE>
<TE>   "Wormtongue scratches too much, he's got sores on his face, he's
got no eyebrows," says Dourif. "I think Wormtongue's a little bitter
because he's secretly despised by everyone."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Burlingame</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Chanukah Song" returns in "Eight Crazy Nights," Adam Sandler's
animated holiday musical.</LD>
<LD>   Sandler, who parlayed a few seasons on NBC's "Saturday Night Live"
into a major film career, incorporates a third version of his radio
hit into the film. "The Chanukah Song" originated on "SNL" in 1994
but achieved wide popularity when Sandler included it on his 1996
album "What the Hell Happened to Me?," which spent 100 weeks on the
Billboard charts .</LD>
<LD>   Nobody was going to mistake Sandler or his co-writers for Cole
Porter. Repetitive guitar licks, bad rhyming schemes ("put on your
yarmulke, here comes Chanukah") and Sandler's annoying delivery,
however, didn't keep listeners from laughing at Sandler's laundry
list of Jewish celebrities who -- theoretically, at least --
celebrate the Festival of Lights.</LD>
<TE>   Sandler updated the tune with a new version on his 1999 album
"Stan and Judy's Kid," and did so again in "Eight Crazy Nights."
Brooks Arthur, the veteran music producer who co-wrote and
co-produced the film, declined to talk about it, citing his
relationship with Sandler (who doesn't do print interviews).</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of "The Chanukah Song" made Sandler one of a few
comedians with novelty song hits about being Jewish, notably Allan
Sherman (whose "Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh" went to No. 2 in 1963).
And Sandler's immense following among those who like their comedy
crude and raw may ensure a new life for the tune when "Eight Crazy
Nights" opens Nov. 27.</TE>

<HD>Being Robert McKee, both on screen and off</HD>
<DH>The screenwriting sage is happy to be the target of
'Adaptation.' He even got actor approval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynn Smith</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Adaptation," the hall of mirrors movie that plays with the angst
of its screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, screenwriting guru Robert McKee
appears as a pivotal character. Brash and bushy-browed, McKee (played
by Brian Cox) embodies Hollywood's crass commercialism, stomping on
creative efforts in favor of tried-and-true paths to commercial
success.</LD>
<LD>   Kaufman is unconventional enough to have written himself into the
story, and his character Charlie (played by Nicolas Cage) sneers at
McKee's "10 commandments of screenwriting," calling his method
"dangerous to writers who want to try something new." He compares
students in McKee's seminars to members of a cult. And he is
determined not to ruin his script with the formulaic car chases,
guns, gratuitous sex or neat Hollywood epiphanies that he believes a
McKee-style film would have.</LD>
<LD>   That caricature of his work doesn't bother him in the slightest,
McKee said. "When they came to me with this draft, I realized of
course what Charlie was doing," McKee said. "The story needed an
antagonist. And I said, 'I'm happy to play your antagonist.' " What's
more, he said, he didn't feel singled out. Kaufman lacerated his own
character, calling himself "fat, bald and repulsive."</LD>
<TE>   The $19-million Sony production will debut Dec. 6 and marks the
second collaboration of Kaufman and Spike Jonze, who created "Being
John Malkovich" (1999), the story of unhappy people who escape into
the mind of the actor. "Adaptation" carries on where "Malkovich" left
off, McKee said, delving this time into the psyche of the
self-obsessed screenwriter as he writes the movie we're watching.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie is struggling to adapt a book by Susan Orlean (Meryl
Streep), who tells the story of Florida orchid thief John Laroche
(Chris Cooper), a man of many short-lived passions. As she spends
time with him, she aches to know why she can't feel the same sort of
passion. Charlie uses her self-inquisition as a jumping-off point for
asking why he can't find a girl, deal with his addictions, do
something meaningful with his life, or just write the adaptation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, his twin, Donald (also Cage), learns scriptwriting from
McKee, impresses Charlie's agent and skips merrily to the bank with a
girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole film takes place in the mind of Charlie Kaufman," McKee
said. "The first clue is that he splits himself into Charlie and
Donald." "Donald" does not exist but is credited as a co-writer.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Charlie's imagination and confidence falter on one track
of the movie, fantasies multiply as the film invents story lines
about people who do exist, making the difficult real-life task of
adapting nonfiction to the screen even trickier. Orlean's and
Laroche's characters, for instance, spin out into wild scenes of sex,
violence and drugs. Everyone depicted gave his or her permission to
be freely imagined, McKee said, and so far no one has complained.</TE>
<TE>   "To my knowledge, everybody took the same attitude I did, the
common sense attitude. They're having fun in order to get at
something else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the themes in Charlie's work, of course, is the struggle
to express himself in an art form that is full of convention," McKee
said. "Hence, my character is there saying, 'Look, you've got to tell
a story.' "</TE>
<TE>   At home in Beverly Hills, McKee had a two-day break between tours
teaching the seminars based on his book "Story: Substance, Structure,
Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting," which has sold 100,000
copies and is taught in dozens of universities. In sweater, jeans and
slippers, he sat on the veranda pouring tea and laughing about the
film version of himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what I teach is a very open, flexible form of thinking
about story," he said. "It's certainly not the rigid three-act
structure he wants to impute to me. That's OK."</TE>
<TE>   No seminar for Kaufman</TE>
<TE>   Whether Kaufman ever attended one of McKee's seminars in real life
is an open question, McKee said. "Charlie says no, and I take him at
his word," he said. (Kaufman was unavailable for comment.)</TE>
<TE>   The two had conversations about the film, but Kaufman never asked
him for advice, McKee said. Still, Kaufman was able to capture his
voice and appearance realistically, particularly in a scene in which
McKee tells Charlie, who in desperation has signed up for his
seminar, that he's wasting his time.</TE>
<TE>   "Charlie's capable of putting himself in my point of view and
looking at the whiny, wimpy writer and realizing what the whiny,
wimpy writer needs to hear. He can see it from all sides," McKee
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, he said, Kaufman was "more than fair" to him. "He gave
me this big redeeming scene where Charlie's character throws his arms
around me and says, 'Thank you, Mr. McKee.' "</TE>
<TE>   And there was another perk. In exchange for letting filmmakers use
copyrighted material, McKee said he was allowed to help cast the
actor to play him. He wanted Cox, he said, because unlike the others
under consideration -- Albert Finney, Christopher Plummer, Terence
Stamp and Michael Caine -- McKee felt the Scottish-born actor
("Manhunter") never has a "love me" subtext to his work.</TE>
<TE>   "Adaptation," like "Malkovich," may have limited commercial
appeal. But "Malkovich" reached beyond the art-house audience to
gross a respectable $22.9 million domestically. And "Adaptation" has
a built-in audience in young cineastes and "Malkovich" fans who have
been following the progress of the movie over the Internet for the
past two years, McKee said.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of them, McKee has found layers of meaning underneath
the humor and the parlor game aspect of sorting fact from fiction in
the film. Screenwriting is used only as a metaphor for the suffering
Americans feel when they come face to face with their fruitless
pursuit of happiness, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Charlie is an antenna for all this suffering and angst
and frustration that floats around in the air here while we all go
about getting to and from work on the freeway. I think Charlie really
feels it ... but it's a truth for all of us. What is the point of all
this? How can I get out of the rut and do something meaningful with
myself?"</TE>
<TE>   Certainly some will interpret the film as overly self-involved,
McKee said, but they've been beaten to that conclusion by Charlie,
who, in the midst of his self-loathing, calls himself not just
self-indulgent but also narcissistic, insane, solipsistic and
pathetic. "That's how he gets away with it," McKee said. "He admits
it. How else are you going to get away with it?"</TE>

<HD>You, the action figure</HD>
<DH>What price immortality? In 6 inches of plastic, it's
$7,500. And the mini-you can get whatever cosmetic surgery the real
you desires.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Renee Tawa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before you ponder the Very Deep Questions posed at Gentle Giant
Studios in Burbank -- Who are you? How do you want to be remembered?
That sort of thing -- you first teeter into an off-to-see-the-wizard
fantasy land, a place where warehouse walls pop in shades of
blueberry, burnt orange and lemon yellow, where a 23-year-old
mohawked sculptor is making a mohawked doll of himself that is also
sculpting a mohawked doll.</LD>
<LD>   Then it's time for the soul-exposing talk with studio founder and
President Karl Z. Meyer. Because Meyer wants to cut to the very core
of who you are, the first step toward creating an action figure that
is you -- or, maybe, a tightened-up or mythically heroic version of
you.</LD>
<LD>   This year, for the first time, through the Neiman Marcus Christmas
Book, Gentle Giant is offering to make two copies of "an exact mini
you." Gentle Giant is the world's leading maker of action-figure
models for such high-profile film productions as "Spider-Man," the
"Lord of the Rings" series and the "Harry Potter" films. The
"adventure package" costs $7,500, not including any travel to, or
accommodations in, Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   Which is cool, suggests Meyer, 35, a former longhaired guitarist
for a rock band named Manroot. But on another level, he acknowledges,
the experience touches on issues of self-identity and immortality,
giving consumers the chance to cast themselves as a 6-inch action
figure -- an iconic status that usually is reserved for movie and
comic-book heroes -- and weigh the temptation of requesting a
Hollywood-ized version of themselves versus the warts-and-all
reality.</TE>
<TE>   "First off," Meyer says, "what do you want to be? Do you want to
be some kind of a superhero? Do you want to be a monster? Do you want
to be yourself? Do you want to be a golfer? We're open to anything
and we'll make it happen."</TE>
<TE>   A team of molders, sculptors and painters also will customize the
action figure, right down to the themed accessories and abs of choice
(say you want Gwen Stefani's stomach muscles, for instance). The
studio's artists, Meyer points out, provide the same kind of touch-up
work for movie stars, which plays right into the fantasy theme of
Neiman Marcus' holiday catalog.</TE>
<TE>   "We just thought it was a cool, very today kind of gift," says
Karen Katz, president and chief executive of Neiman Marcus Direct.
"We really try to find things that are difficult [for the public] to
have access to."</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one has ordered an action figure, but the item has
drawn as many inquiries as any other fantasy gift in the 160-page
catalog, Katz says. She and her 13-year-old son, Alex, recently flew
to Burbank from Dallas to have action figures made of themselves.
Neither opted to sub out any body parts.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the opportunity to order your own action figure can be
fun, but it also points to the insidious influence of a mass media
that flaunts impossibly perfect and beautiful people, says Harvard
Medical School psychologist Roberto Olivardia, coauthor of "The
Adonis Complex" (Free Press, 2000). Olivardia has studied the way
some boys and young men idealize the physique of action figures such
as G.I. Joe, even though, if the toy were the same size as a human,
its physical dimensions would be unreal, he notes. In extreme cases,
such preteen boys and adolescents can suffer from eating disorders or
start using steroids.</TE>
<TE>   Olivardia is not surprised at the Neiman Marcus offering, but says
he suspects some people might take their made-to-order action figure
too seriously. "If you make the request -- make it thinner, give it
more muscle -- that's something you idealize. The more you're
confronted with the visual display of your fantasy, and look ... in
the mirror, and see a little body fat, or your biceps aren't as big,
what does that do?"</TE>
<TE>   But even with creative sculpting, the action figure still would
capture the essence of the person based on unerring digital imagery,
Meyer says.</TE>
<TE>   From clay to digital</TE>
<TE>   Gentle Giant, which was founded eight years ago, is the world's
most prominent studio of its kind, using 3-D digital images to help
create toys, games and visual effects for films and TV. The process
is far more accurate in capturing a person or character's likeness
than the traditional method, in which artists hand-sculpted clay
prototypes of action figures by eyeing photographs, he says.</TE>
<TE>   These days, young people expect the same kind of realism in action
figures that they see in video games and movie special effects, says
Meyer, who oversees a staff of 60. "With the exception of nostalgia,
where you want something to look like that thing you had when you
were a kid, or your dad had, there's no going back. No one is going
to start making action figures of people that don't look like them
because no one will buy them anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Digital scanners capture details such as the pockmarks on a famous
actor's face that would have been removed in the sculpting process or
the blondish-red highlights in the auburn hair of Katz from Neiman
Marcus. Meyer, of course, has his own action figure, in jaunty GQ
repose, jacket tossed over shoulder, shirt wrinkled at the bottom
where he had untucked the tails.</TE>
<TE>   3-D nip and tuck</TE>
<TE>   Everyone, including famous models and actors, is self-conscious
about the imaging process, says Meyer. On a recent afternoon, after
posing for the scanner, he worries aloud about his slight gut. "Even
now, I've done this a thousand times, and I'm thinking, I should have
sucked it in a little more."</TE>
<TE>   Self-consciousness aside, the process is painless for the subject,
who climbs onto a round platform for a 3-D portrait taken by lasers
and digital cameras in 20 seconds. Based on the digital image, a
computer-generated model is created and cast into plastic, after
refinements by sculptors and painters. The toy is complete in about
two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if we're going to sell five of these or 500," says
Meyer, who guesses that the fantasy figures would appeal more to men.
"Women, I think, really don't want an action figure of themselves....
Men have a complex about immortality and being remembered and leaving
their mark on the world." One ailing 61-year-old grandfather recently
called him, for instance, to ask if he could get an action figure
made of himself for his grandson.</TE>
<TE>   Gentle Giant sculptor Matt Aylward has made one action figure of
himself, complete with multiple hoop and stud earrings, jet-black
sideburns and a mohawked tuft of his own hair. "My grandma really
liked it," he says. He keeps his personal Mini-Me on his desk, and
sometimes, "it's pretty creepy," he says with a grin. "There's Matt,
and here's Matt."</TE>
<TE>   Now he's making another mohawked doll of himself, this one as a
sculptor at work with miniature tools. Aylward got the idea partly
from the famous Norman Rockwell painting of the artist working on his
self-portrait and was also inspired by historical figures such as
Beethoven who had their images preserved in face masks.</TE>
<TE>   "There are life casts of people who have been dead for 50 years,"
Aylward says. "This is one step further than that. This is an actual
three-dimensional digital photograph. This is going to be around
forever."</TE>

<LD>Gentle Giant Studios in Burbank is a pioneer in using 3-D digital
scans to help create action figures, videos and special effects for
Hollywood productions such as "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the
Clones."</LD>
<LD>   The huge scanners can capture props on a movie set, or humans who
strike a pose on a platform that is surrounded by four mounted boxes
the size of a TV monitor. The boxes hold digital cameras that capture
the person's image in 20 seconds.</LD>
<LD>   Technicians then work on that image via computer, making sure that
the data from the scan are in the right format and desired size. They
then feed the information to a 3-D Systems ThermoJet printer, which
spits out a three-dimensional wax prototype.</LD>
<TE>   A mold of the action figure is made from the prototype, which is
refined and detailed by sculptors. The figure then is cast into
plastic and hand-painted.</TE>

<DH>Can the Oscar wannabes compete with the high-profile
franchise films? Read on.</DH>

<LD>The holiday season is upon us, and in Hollywood that means the rush
is on to roll out the year's final slate of potential blockbusters,
Oscar hopefuls, family comedies, sci-fi thrillers and a flurry of
independent dramas. With that in mind, here are the big questions
looming over the season:</LD>
<LD>   Will the holiday season supply an Oscar front-runner for best
picture?</LD>
<LD>   This year, the buzz is more about performances than films. That
said, the holiday season in recent years has been the launching pad
for Academy Award winners such as "A Beautiful Mind," "Titanic" and
"The English Patient."</LD>
<TE>   With no one film dominating the debate so far, holiday season
arrivals will receive special attention. New films that bear watching
for best picture: the lethal-ladies musical "Chicago"; Martin
Scorsese's 19th century epic "Gangs of New York"; Steven Spielberg's
retro chase saga "Catch Me if You Can"; the effects-driven fantasy
sequel "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"; the stylized '50s
drama "Far From Heaven"; Denzel Washington's directorial debut,
"Antwone Fisher"; Roman Polanski's Holocaust drama "The Pianist"; and
Stephen Daldry's cross-generational female drama "The Hours."</TE>
<TE>   Comment: If Polanski won, would he show up for the Oscars?</TE>
<TE>   Will moviegoers play therapist to the dysfunctional male
characters whose boring lives or fragile grips on reality are a theme
of many of the season's films?</TE>
<TE>   In "About Schmidt," Jack Nicholson plays a buttoned-down widower
whose calm demeanor masks a seething anger at his humdrum existence
as he drives a Winnebago through America's heartland. In
"Adaptation," Nicolas Cage plays a screenwriter who worries about
getting fat, losing his hair and not getting a girl, while his dumb
twin brother breezes through life and even sells his first screenplay
without effort. In "Spider," Ralph Fiennes' character is an acute
schizophrenic who is released from a mental hospital after many
years. In "Analyze That," the sequel to the hit comedy "Analyze
This," Robert De Niro returns as a Mafioso in need of therapy again
from his stressed-out psychiatrist (Billy Crystal).</TE>
<TE>   Comment: Can "Analyze Everybody" starring Dr. Phil be far behind?</TE>
<TE>   Can "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," "The Lord of the
Rings: The Two Towers" or the latest James Bond thriller "Die Another
Day" out-gross "Spider-Man," which took in $114.9 million on its
opening weekend?</TE>
<TE>   "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" has all the earmarks of
being a blockbuster to rival its predecessor, "Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone," which debuted last year with $90.3 million, but
box-office experts say most sequels have trouble outperforming their
predecessors. Still, there are plenty of little witches and goblins
who can be counted on to flood their local megaplexes on opening
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   As for "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" and "Die Another
Day," look for huge openings, which one would expect from two popular
franchises that last time out grossed $850 million and $352 million,
respectively, worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: These three films will eclipse "Spider-Man" provided
Harry confronts Bond in a game of midair Quidditch somewhere over
Middle Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Will James Bond come to the rescue of MGM?</TE>
<TE>   MGM fell on its face with a string of big-budget flops like
"Bandits," "Rollerball," "Hart's War" and "Windtalkers" before the
hit urban comedy "Barbershop" revived the studio's fortunes. Look for
"Die Another Day," the 20th installment in the Bond saga, to be a
blockbuster, if for no other reason than Oscar winner Halle Berry
plays the newest Bond girl..</TE>
<TE>   Comment: If Bond isn't a hit, look for a sequel to "Hannibal" in
the executive suites of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Kirk Kerkorian will
serve up brains for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Will "Gangs of New York" finally be ready for release Dec. 20?</TE>
<TE>   If the film is half as gripping as what went on behind the scenes
of Martin Scorsese's epic about gang warfare in mid-19th century
Manhattan, then moviegoers could be in for a ride.</TE>
<TE>   Many wonder what the matchup of the colorful, scrappy Scorsese and
tempestuous Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein will create. Production
costs soared above $100 million and the film arrived a year late.
Even with bankable stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz and
Daniel Day-Lewis, the film -- about 2 hours, 40 minutes -- needs to
gross about twice its budget to break even.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: Weinstein wants to see the Academy Awards stage part of
next year's show in the Big Apple. Should that fail, perhaps he can
stage a "Gangs of New York Awards" at Radio City Music Hall, handing
gold-plated "Harveys."</TE>
<TE>   Will Denzel Washington, who won the Oscar for best actor in
"Training Day" earlier this year, make Academy Award history by
winning best director for "Antwone Fisher"?</TE>
<TE>   The true test for Washington will come if the Directors Guild of
America nominates the actor for its DGA Award. The winner of that
award almost always goes on to win the Oscar for best director.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: Any actor who appeared on the old TV hospital series "St.
Elsewhere" has just as good a chance of becoming a great director as
Richie Cunningham ... er ... Ron Howard of "Happy Days" fame.</TE>
<TE>   Can edgy, darker movies fare well during the holidays?</TE>
<TE>   There is no shortage of serious films. "Narc" follows two brutal
cops in search of a cop killer. "The Hours" tells the intertwined
stories of three women linked by their yearnings and fears. "El
Crimen del Padre Amaro" has already ignited anger in segments of the
Catholic community for its stark depiction of a priest involved in an
affair. "The Pianist" follows a brilliant pianist, a Polish Jew,
eluding capture by the Nazis in Warsaw.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: After maxing out their credit cards at the mall, Mom and
Dad are always eager to take in some films that offer a bleak take on
the world. OK, so they didn't flock to "Angela's Ashes."</TE>
<TE>   With all this on-screen dreariness, will romantic comedies provide
an appealing alternative?</TE>
<TE>   The pairings of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock in the office
romance "Two Weeks Notice" and Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fiennes as
lovers from different socioeconomic worlds in "Maid in Manhattan"
look like can't-miss hits.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: They said the same thing about Michelle Pfeiffer and
George Clooney in "One Fine Day" and Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond
in "Sabrina."</TE>
<TE>   Is America ready for a feature-length film about Chuck Barris?</TE>
<TE>   There has to be a compelling story in anyone who writes a book
claiming that while he was producing such TV programs as "The Gong
Show" and "The Dating Game," he was moonlighting as a CIA assassin.
But is George Clooney the right filmmaker to tell it? Hollywood is
eager to see what box-office star Clooney has wrought as he directs
Drew Barrymore, Julia Roberts, Sam Rockwell and himself in
"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."</TE>
<TE>   Comment: On "The Gong Show," contestants would perform until one
of the three judges grabbed a mallet and banged a giant gong. Will
film critics be as cruel?</TE>
<TE>   Why isn't there a lavish Disney animated musical this year?</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, as Hollywood rediscovers live-action musicals with
such films as "Moulin Rouge" and the upcoming "Chicago," the days of
animated musicals are waning. Hollywood is rolling out "The Wild
Thornberrys," "Adam Sandler's 8 Crazy Nights" and Disney's "Treasure
Planet." Yearning for a big animated musical? Disney is releasing an
Imax "The Lion King" on Christmas Day.</TE>

<HD>A razzle-dazzle pitchman</HD>
<DH>The 'Chicago' project was languishing in movie jail, but
Rob Marshall knew how to spring it -- even though he'd never made a
feature film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michele Willens</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>New York</DL>
<LD>Broadway director-choreographer Rob Marshall was invited to the
Miramax Films offices here a year and a half ago to discuss directing
the film version of "Rent." But he had a secret agenda. He knew the
company had been trying for years to get a film version of one of his
favorite stage musicals, "Chicago," off the ground.</LD>
<LD>   "Right before we started, I said, 'I know you're trying to do
"Chicago." ' And I said, 'Can I just tell you what I would do with
the movie?' The next thing I know, they're taking me into Harvey
Weinstein's office and I'm doing my pitch for him. I even got up and
performed a few numbers."</LD>
<LD>   He got the gig on the spot.</LD>
<TE>   That's no small deal because the project -- dealing with two
infamous murderesses (Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger) in
1920s Chicago and their corrupt attorney, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere)
-- had been kicking around since the well-received 1996 revival
became a Tony-winning hit. Writers such as Larry Gelbart and Wendy
Wasserstein and actresses such as Liza Minnelli, Goldie Hawn and
Madonna had come and gone. But no package was deemed good enough by
Miramax to get a green light.</TE>
<TE>   What Marshall proposed was twofold: First, forget the conventional
"he sings to her and she sings to him" musical format. "I knew these
numbers had to take place on some kind of stage," he says.
"Everything in 'Chicago' is based on vaudevillian routines. There's
the Sophie Tucker number, the Helen Morgan number, the ventriloquist
number. You can't eliminate that element, so you have to incorporate
it."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall then dealt with the question, "OK, why would they be on a
stage?" His answer was using one of the characters, theatrical
wannabe Roxie Hart (played by Zellweger), as a catalyst. "So we have
two worlds: the real world of Chicago and the theatrical world seen
through her eyes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now "Chicago" is a movie and strong buzz is already sweeping
through an initially skeptical industry. With the exception of
"Moulin Rouge" -- "which has paved the way for us," says Marshall --
there hasn't been a stylized, successful musical since "Cabaret"
(1972) and "All That Jazz" (1979). ("Evita," from 1996, is considered
a qualified success, critically and commercially.)</TE>
<TE>   Marshall is an ebullient, trim bundle of energy who choreographed
and directed "Little Me" on Broadway, co-directed the revival of
"Cabaret" with Sam Mendes, and directed the well-received TV version
of "Annie."</TE>
<TE>   "We're probably closest to 'Cabaret' because Bob Fosse [its
Oscar-winning director] also put all his numbers on a stage,"
Marshall says.</TE>
<TE>   Fosse was, in fact, the first director attached to a filmed
"Chicago" since he had directed its original stage version, which
starred Chita Rivera and his wife, Gwen Verdon, in 1975. He was in
discussions with Marty Richards, the producer who owned the rights to
the project, about a film version when he dropped dead on a New York
street in 1987. "Bob said he'd do it as soon as he got done with
'Sweet Charity' on Broadway, but he died during the run," says
Richards, who likes to say he's been working on this since his
"confirmation." He turned 70 on the day the film wrapped. "I remember
Bob telling me he was interested in the emerging performer Madonna,
saying, ' I'll get her an Oscar nomination.' "</TE>
<TE>   Things stalled and the project was just going into turnaround when
a sexy and spare revival of the musical (directed by Marshall first
in Los Angeles) took Broadway by storm. The first director Richards
went to was Baz Luhrmann, who would go on to direct a jazzed-up
"Romeo and Juliet" and "Moulin Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he didn't do things unless he developed them on his
own," Richards says, laughing. "Later I thought, well, William
Shakespeare isn't exactly new!"</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Hytner, who directed the acclaimed revival of "Carousel"
in London and New York (and, later, the film "The Madness of King
George"), also became attached as director and brought in his friend
Wasserstein to have a stab at the script, without the knowledge of
producer Richards. Gelbart has sour memories of the process: "I began
work on 'Chicago' in 1995 and went on to enough drafts to contract
double pneumonia -- at least seven. It was one of the most
distasteful periods of my professional life. If I had it to do over
again, I would have written the experience with a happier ending for
me -- but then Miramax would probably call someone in to rewrite that
too."</TE>
<TE>   And there things stood until Marshall -- who'd never made a
feature film -- walked into the Miramax offices.</TE>
<TE>   His first order of business was finding a screenwriter, and he
finally landed on Bill Condon, a writer-director who had recently won
an Oscar for his screenplay of "Gods and Monsters." Condon, like so
many on this project, didn't have a musical on his resume but was a
longtime lover of the genre and "Chicago" in particular. (He'd seen
it three times on stage.) Like Marshall, he knew that moving a
musical from stage to screen was littered with land mines.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd all seen those leaden musicals," he says. "I mean, 'Chorus
Line' became sludge on screen. Rob and I agreed that the key was
figuring out how to keep the vaudevillian world of the play in a
separate universe from the reality in the piece. I did an outline and
then we read it to Harvey Weinstein. Halfway through he slammed the
table and said, 'I get it!' It was one of those eureka moments."</TE>
<TE>   Condon did borrow a beat here or there from some of the numerous
previous efforts. "There's a plot twist at the end that came from
Larry Gelbart's script, having to do with Velma stealing Roxie's
diary and taking the stand in court," he says. Experiencing the
film's fast-paced "razzle-dazzle," one might assume that it's all in
the editing. In fact, every one of those edits is written into the
script, explains Condon. "For example, what would we show in [the
hypocritical, self-aggrandizing] Billy Flynn's real world, when in
the fantasy world he's singing 'All I Care About Is Love?' So I put
in that he's getting fitted for an expensive suit and kicking the
tailor."</TE>
<TE>   On to the dance numbers</TE>
<TE>   When the script was finished, Marshall started on the dance
numbers. The first thing he did was throw out the original Fosse
choreography so associated with the piece and create his own.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob Fosse to me is the genius of all time," says Marshall, "but I
have too much respect for him than to bastardize his work. When he
did 'Cabaret' on film, he created his own choreography. So I knew he
would understand. I think it is full of his spirit."</TE>
<TE>   By this time, as producer Richards says, "the actors originally
associated with it grew too old," and Miramax told Marshall and Co.
to begin again. While Marshall's theater background might lead him to
friends like Bebe Neuwirth, who'd won the Tony for the newer stage
version, he grasped the politics. "Miramax was taking enough of a
chance on a musical so it was understood they expected movie stars."</TE>
<TE>   First cast was Catherine Zeta-Jones, whom Marshall heard had done
musicals like "42nd Street" on stage in Europe. He felt she had the
perfect look for Velma, who starts off as a star, snubs the
impressionable Roxie and later pays dearly for it. "Catherine had
played these big characters, but what's nice is here she begins as a
star and is immediately dethroned. She said, 'I'm going to be the
underdog for most of this movie ... and I love it!' "</TE>
<TE>   For the role of sleazy lawyer Flynn, Marshall thought of Richard
Gere. (Richards acknowledges he'd approached Kevin Kline, who had
another commitment.) "He's perfect as a charming cad," says Marshall,
"but you still like him. Everyone in this movie is corrupt, but my
hope is you like them despite that." Gere, who'd performed in stage
musicals years ago, among them "Grease" in London, sings his two
numbers well and performs an impressive tap dance.</TE>
<TE>   "Rob and I come from Broadway, so it would never do for us to use
stand-ins for performers," explains John DeLuca, dance supervisor and
Marshall's general "right hand." He and Marshall worked with Gere
during the rehearsal period. "This was new for Richard, like a
foreign language, but he worked hard and he has real style."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest challenge was casting Roxie Hart.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd always thought if we could get a Renee Zellweger type who
sings and dances, we'd have it made. She's vulnerable, likable and
has so much depth that you can follow her through a whole movie,"
says Marshall. She was initially unavailable, so he began a process
wherein a dozen actresses -- "Meg Ryan level," he says -- flew to New
York for a song-and-dance session with him. Eventually Zellweger
agreed to come and talk. And then dance. And finally sing.</TE>
<TE>   "She just watched for a while, then closed the door so it was just
me and her, and she picked up the dance steps like that," says
Marshall. "She didn't want to sing yet, but we were having dinner
later and she asked about the songs and I started singing and then
she started singing and it turns out her voice has this Billie
Holiday quality."</TE>
<TE>   "The conceit of the film is seeing everything through Roxie's
eyes," adds screenwriter Condon. "And half the battle was getting
Renee."</TE>
<TE>   Filming took place over three months in Toronto, where much of the
look was accomplished by production designer John Myrhe. The songs
were recorded first, and while the actors spent a few weeks
rehearsing, Myrhe was turning an old warehouse into a 3-story,
turn-of-the-century vaudeville house. "We ended up with one of the
best theatrical stages in Toronto," he says. "I learned so much since
this was half Hollywood, half Broadway. I had to build all kinds of
different surfaces for the dancers, some that were slick to slide on,
or sticky or scuffed up, depending what a number needed."</TE>
<TE>   "One of the most difficult challenges was organizing the rehearsal
periods and getting all the numbers prerecorded before starting
shooting," says Neil Meron, who with Craig Zadan executive-produced
the film. "Which means the actors really have to gauge their
performances and where characters will be at a point in the future."</TE>
<TE>   "Also," adds Zadan, "whenever you deal with a movie company that
has never done a musical -- which is every movie company -- it's hard
to get across what you need."</TE>
<TE>   Keepers of the flame</TE>
<TE>   Zadan and Meron have probably done more than anyone to revive the
filmed musical: They brought Bette Midler to TV in "Gypsy." They
followed with Whitney Houston and Brandy in "Cinderella," which
reached 60 million viewers. And "Annie" was the most highly viewed TV
movie of 1999. (Next: "The Music Man," with Matthew Broderick, in
February.)</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is," says Zadan, "there are lots of great filmmakers,
but none know how to make musicals. I talked to Ron Howard in 1984
about doing 'Footloose,' which he loved, but said he had no idea how
to do a musical. Spielberg recently said he wants to do one."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it was director Marshall who set the tone. Though a
newcomer to film, his theatrical background worked. "I know how to
tell a story in two hours," he says, "and even though others know a
million more technical tricks than I do, I know how to work with
actors."</TE>
<TE>   So what about "Rent," where it all started? Marshall laughs. "They
still haven't talked to me about it yet!"</TE>

<LD>"Proof," David Auburn's Tony- and Pulitzer-winning drama about a
mentally ill math genius and his daughter, ranks as by far the
nation's most-produced play of the 2002-03 season, according to
American Theatre magazine's annual survey of more than 400 nonprofit
stages. With 29 productions scheduled -- including one at South Coast
Repertory Jan. 3-Feb. 9, 2003 -- "Proof" just about doubles the
nearest contenders. ("Proof" was also seen in June at the Wilshire
Theater.)</LD>
<LD>   "Dirty Blonde," Claudia Shear's look at Mae West, has 15 and
"Copenhagen," Michael Frayn's speculative historical work about a
mysterious episode in Nazi Germany's quest for the atom bomb that was
seen at the Wilshire and the Laguna Playhouse, has 14.  "Fully
Committed," Becky Mode's one-actor show about a harried restaurant
reservationist, has 12 productions (and was seen at the Coronet and
the Laguna Playhouse); David Sedaris' "The Santaland Diaries" has 10
and "The Laramie Project," nine. All six titles also made last year's
list of the 10 most-produced plays.</LD>
<LD>   Sixteen other shows, which have also been seen at various venues
in the area, occupy the last four spots on the list led by "Bat Boy:
the Musical," "The Drawer Boy" and "Lobby Hero" with eight
productions each and "My Way: A Musical Tribute to Frank Sinatra" and
August Wilson's "The Piano Lesson" with seven.</LD>
<TE>   The list does not include works by Shakespeare or productions of
"A Christmas Carol."</TE>

<HD>A seismic shift for Riverside's fragile stereographs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The world capital of old-fashioned stereographic photos -- that is,
the UC Riverside Museum of Photography -- just got richer.</LD>
<LD>   Museum officials have landed a $500,000 federal grant to help
build a more secure storage and display area for the Keystone-Mast
Stereographic Collection, which includes nearly every known stereo
card image printed between 1890 and 1940, some 350,000 prints and
250,000 of the negatives from which they were made, together making
up the world's largest collection of stereographs and stereographic
materials.</LD>
<LD>   Subjects, typically captured on detailed negatives, range from
Mark Twain to American Indians to Afghanistan in the 1930s. The
grant, from the National Endowment for the Arts, will be used to
construct a seismically isolated storage system to help cushion the
fragile collection -- the negatives are pieces of glass, each
measuring 4 by 8 inches -- from the region's frequent small (and
occasionally large) earthquakes.</LD>
<TE>   The museum stands at 3824 Main St. along Riverside's downtown
pedestrian mall. The Keystone View Co., founded in 1892, was based in
Meadeville, Pa. But Gifford Mast of Davenport, Iowa, bought the
company and its archives in 1963, and in the late 1970s the Mast
family donated the archive to the fledgling Riverside museum.</TE>
<TE>   With the grant money, officials say, they will move the
stereographic collection from its current site -- atop one of the
state's three most active earthquake faults -- to a seismically
isolated storage area. That storage area will be in the basement of
the Rouse Building, a former department store next to the museum that
was purchased by the university last year.</TE>
<TE>   University plans also call for a creation of a multidisciplinary
center for the arts there bearing the name of the Culver family,
which put up $5 million toward the purchase. Museum officials say
they expect the building's conversion to take three years.</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside museum also houses the Bingham Technology collection
of 10,000 cameras and viewing devices, along with an interactive
photo technology gallery and a collection of prints that includes
works from Ansel Adams and Walker Evans.</TE>

<LD>Who charms the husk right off the corn? Mame, of course, but is Carol
Lawrence or Amanda McBroom the better husk-charmer?</LD>
<LD>   Dueling productions of "Mame" opened this weekend. Lawrence is in
the Musical Theatre West staging at the Carpenter Center in Long
Beach. McBroom leads the cast in the Cabrillo Music Theatre
production at Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza.</LD>
<LD>   Producers of both "Mames" say that "Mame" composer Jerry Herman
has advised their respective teams. Each says that the two venues are
sufficiently far apart that there probably won't be much of an
overlap in their audiences.</LD>
<TE>   And if you live in between the two venues? "You have two
opportunities, much like a movie is in 10 theaters at once," said
Musical Theatre West producer Paul Garman. Still, Garman acknowledged
that he contacted Cabrillo to see if it might alter its dates. "Then
we could have shared the costs of the set." Cabrillo didn't want to
budge.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, on a smaller level, two renditions of "The Woman in
Black," at Pasadena Shakespeare Company in South Pasadena and the
Road Theatre in North Hollywood, are also up and running right now.</TE>

<HD>Opera Pacific sings about subscribers</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Opera Pacific will open its 17th season Tuesday at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center with Puccini's "La Boheme," a change in the
executive team, a deficit of roughly $1 million (of an $8-million
budget) and a drop in individual ticket buyers. But it also has a
rise in subscribers.</LD>
<LD>   Patricia Houk, director of production for 22 years at Houston
Grand Opera, has taken the same post with Opera Pacific, replacing
Mitchell Krieger, who held the position since 1998 and left in late
August. Assistant conductor Kelly Kou will become artistic
administrator in addition to his conducting duties. John DeMain and
Martin Hubbard remain artistic director and executive director,
respectively. Hubbard said the management structure change was made
to spread the duties more efficiently.</LD>
<LD>   Hubbard attributed the deficit to a falloff in single ticket sales
following the events of Sept. 11. Single-ticket sales for the new
season remain sluggish, he said, although there has been enough
demand to add a sixth performance of "La Boheme" (on Wednesday) to
the usual run of five. Subscription sales have risen 14% so far, from
7,074 to about 8,096.</LD>

<KH>THEATER</KH>
<HD>In for the long haul</HD>
<DH>The first show was carted around in a station wagon. Now,
South Coast Repertory is expanding to three stages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Boehm</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the beginning they needed everything -- and made do with almost
nothing.</LD>
<LD>   Today, South Coast Repertory is a nationally respected,
well-funded regional theater known for giving birth to important new
plays. In a bid to enhance that stature, it has spent $19 million to
expand and renovate. On Tuesday, the first performance of Richard
Greenberg's new work, "The Violet Hour," will usher in South Coast's
third and newest space, the 336-seat Julianne Argyros Stage.</LD>
<LD>   The theater complex in Costa Mesa stands atop a mountain of lore
that has been growing since August 1963. That's when recent San
Francisco State theater graduates David Emmes and Martin Benson drank
coffee late into the night in a Long Beach restaurant and hatched a
plan.</LD>
<TE>   "Martin Benson and I are going to start a theater within a year
from now," Emmes wrote to one of their professors soon after their
talk. "We do not believe that good theater as we understand it is in
existence in our part of the state ....We propose to do something
about it."</TE>
<TE>   The story unfolded in scenes that are now almost mythic: The house
in Long Beach where virtually the entire company -- 14 people --
lodged during the summer of 1964, each member kicking in $5 a week so
that actress-cook Martha McFarland could feed them communal meals --
usually noodle casseroles.</TE>
<TE>   The inaugural production the following fall -- a minimalist
"Tartuffe" that the homeless company could pack into Emmes'
avocado-colored 1960 Studebaker Lark station wagon to tour Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   The first home -- a former used boating equipment store near the
Newport Beach waterfront that the fledgling theater acquired from
Emmes' stepfather, who let them have it in exchange for their sweat.
Before they could convert it into a 75-seat theater, the gang of
scrawny artists had to haul tons of Samuel Emmes' secondhand marine
gear to a nearby warehouse.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what happened next, in the words of some of those who lived
it.</TE>
<TE>   Emmes: "We were full of fervor and zeal, as only recent graduates
can be."</TE>
<TE>   Benson: "And Red Mountain wine. Dollar fifty-one a gallon. We'd
get the vin rose."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Boussom, actor: "It was virgin territory, and we had an
awareness about ourselves, a sense of purpose: We were going to bring
theater to Orange County. We were a very tight-knit family, and we
had a cause we believed in with an absolute passion."</TE>
<TE>   By the fifth season, 1968-69, the zeal had worn off. Money was so
scarce that Benson and Emmes programmed a couple of musicals -- "The
Threepenny Opera" and "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Forum" -- just to generate cash. Both shows were flops.</TE>
<TE>   Benson: "We sold out, and we didn't get that much for it. We sold
out cheap."</TE>
<TE>   Emmes: "After having it blow up in our face twice, I think we kind
of realized, 'Better stick to your guns.' "</TE>
<TE>   A desire to push boundaries</TE>
<TE>   South Coast was learning how far it could go in challenging
audiences. Its leaders at first envisioned avant-garde theater as an
important part of their mission, along with classics and new American
plays. But by 1970, productions of offbeat works such as Brecht's
"Baal," Sam Shepard's "La Turista" and Edward Bond's "Saved" (with
its infamous scene of thugs urinating on a baby in its carriage, then
stoning it to death) had alienated many playgoers and contributors.</TE>
<TE>   Buddy Ebsen of "The Beverly Hillbillies" had been an early
benefactor of SCR but parted ways over "Saved." Benson and Emmes had
to learn an artistic balancing act -- how to be adventurous and
creative, yet not leave the audience behind.</TE>
<TE>   It's an ongoing struggle -- witness the droves of walkouts that
greeted SCR's 2000 world premiere of Howard Korder's "The Hollow
Lands," a sprawling epic that cast America's westward expansion as a
rapacious, racist enterprise undertaken by murderers, drunks and
megalomaniacs.</TE>
<TE>   Ebsen, recalling "Saved": "They opened their pants and at that
point I took my son, Dusty, and said, 'We're leaving.' Other people
left, too. I thought it was an unfortunate choice of material."</TE>
<TE>   Emmes: "During our early years we alienated a good cross section
of the community. We do plays today that still offend people, but we
can't get so far ahead of an audience that they can't follow. Then
we're not serving them and we're not serving ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Henry T. Segerstrom, an arts patron, after whom SCR has named its
largest stage: "Once in a while I feel challenged, but that's
healthy. We don't want a limp dishrag."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Cohen, UC Irvine drama professor since 1965: "They're not
the grittiest theater in town. I don't expect to see European
avant-garde there, but this is not in any way a complaint. New-play
repertoire is probably the most important and dangerous area for an
American theater, and theirs is terrific."</TE>
<TE>   Emmes and Benson learned to cultivate patrons and raise money, and
by 1979, South Coast was a major regional company running plays on
two stages. It soon began to nurture playwrights.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Patch, SCR dramaturge: "David and Martin made a decision
that we would try to make our name with new work; that if we were
going to be a force in American theater, we would do it with
relationships with writers that endure over time."</TE>
<TE>   John Glore, former SCR literary manager: "Commissioning was not
done much back then. People tended to think of commissions as
projects -- an idea they would think of themselves and go out and
find a writer to do that work. South Coast said, 'No, commissions are
not about a specific project, they're an investment in the writer, a
faith in the writer's ability to create something worthwhile.' "</TE>
<TE>   Donald Margulies, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright: "I wrote a
play to fulfill that first commission that just wasn't working. They
could have said, 'OK, nice working with you.' But they were delighted
to let me try again. They created a non-pressured environment where I
felt confident enough to just go for it."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Greenberg, playwright and Pulitzer finalist: "There's the
right proportion of interfering and letting alone. There really isn't
any butting in for the sake of ego. They trust you and let you do
your work."</TE>
<TE>   Emmes: "We try to do things in a Socratic way, asking questions --
'Why this? We don't understand that' -- without trying to prescribe
what the fix should be. Because we know that the fixes we have in the
backs of our minds are pretty pedestrian compared to what the
playwright comes up with. If you pose the question properly and the
playwright is able to find the answer, it's going to be exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Amy Freed, playwright and Pulitzer finalist: "Once, David called
me and said he'd gone scuba diving and had new inspiration about a
scene in 'The Beard of Avon' that we'd been arguing comfortably about
for months and months. I said, 'Oh no, not underwater inspiration.'
But you want to know that somebody is caring deeply enough to take it
on vacation."</TE>
<TE>   David Chambers, frequent director at SCR: "The managing director
of Yale Repertory said, 'Your friends out in California strike me as
a little naive. They want a very low percentage from future
productions [of Korder's SCR-spawned "Search and Destroy"].' I said,
'They're not naive. They're truly supporting the writer and not
taking their pound of flesh.' "</TE>
<TE>   Tim Sanford, artistic director of Playwrights Horizons in New
York: "When it comes to new work, they're probably one of the five
most important theaters in the country. Writers want to work there.
It's a prestigious gig."</TE>
<TE>   Benson: "The ultimate god in our theater is the playwright."</TE>
<TE>   Nurturing in-house talent</TE>
<TE>   While casting a wide net for acting talent, South Coast, in an
unusual arrangement, stayed tied to its roots by guaranteeing six
months' annual salary to six "founding artist" actors who were
linchpins of the troupe from its earliest days -- even though the
theater's growth and the actors' advancing age mean they often play
supporting roles instead of leads (two of the six are no longer with
the company).</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, SCR audiences have seen Dennis Franz ("NYPD
Blues"), Ed Harris, Tom Hulce ("Amadeus"), Toni Tennille and Bradley
Whitford ("The West Wing") and his wife Jane Kaczmarek ("Malcolm in
the Middle") before most of the film- and TV-watching public knew who
they were. Marquee names who have played at South Coast after they
were anointed on screen include Jean Stapleton, Elizabeth McGovern
and Joe Spano.</TE>
<TE>   Hal Landon Jr., founding artist: "I had to admit, painful as it
was, that I wasn't really as good as some of those people they were
bringing in. For about four years, I worked intensively to learn some
real formal skills, which made a huge difference. I started getting
good parts again."</TE>
<TE>   Martha McFarland, founding artist: "It's a matter of David and
Martin being incredibly loyal. They have reaped rewards from this
theater emotionally and artistically and financially, and they didn't
want to forget the people that helped them."</TE>
<TE>   Chambers: "Joel Grey called me and said, 'I'd love to play Astrov
in "Uncle Vanya." ' I brought it up to David Emmes, and David's
reaction was not, 'Great, let's go for it,' but, 'Do you really think
he'd be a good Astrov?' "</TE>
<TE>   Lee Shallat-Chemel, former SCR staff director: "Anthony Hopkins
wanted to do 'Hamlet' down here [in the late 1970s]. But he wanted to
bring in his own director and some people to be in the cast. I was
jumping up and down, saying, 'Do it! Do it!' But they were very wary
of big-name people coming in and sort of taking artistic control."</TE>
<TE>   Emmes: "We're not interested in running a star system. The minute
you start down the road of celebrity, that's a very dangerous path
for a theater like ours."</TE>
<TE>   Benson and Emmes say their partnership has thrived because of
tastes that match, and talents that differ.</TE>
<TE>   Benson: "We've never had any major disagreements about where we
wanted the theater to go. And each of us gravitates toward and has
talents in areas that did not compete with the other. David early on
showed a gift for planning and looking further down the road than I
did. It has stood us in wonderful stead over the years."</TE>
<TE>   Glore: "David and Martin never made me feel as if they were my
boss and I was answering to them. It was a very collaborative, very
collegial environment. And they walk in tandem so easily you never
felt you were caught between the two guys who run the theater."</TE>
<TE>   Don Took, founding artist: "David is an intellectual. He covers
all the cerebral areas. He can lay out a scene, tell you how he wants
to see it go. Martin is instinctive. He doesn't quite have it all
worked out in advance and lets an actor find his own way. That's one
reason they balance each other so well. It's like the heart and the
brain."</TE>
<TE>   Happy to stick close to home</TE>
<TE>   While the leaders of neighboring regional theaters, such as La
Jolla Playhouse and San Diego's Globe Theatres, have taken shows from
their home stages to Broadway, Benson and Emmes stay home -- the only
exceptions were Benson's trips to Seattle and Houston in 1999 to
direct the SCR-originated Pulitzer Prize winner "Wit."</TE>
<TE>   Glore: "They could have made more money on some of the plays that
started there and went on to great success, if they had been a little
more proactive. I guess they are kind of homebodies. It means they
really are paying attention to their own audience and trying to do
world-class work, not because they want the world to notice, but so
Costa Mesa can have it."</TE>
<TE>   Emmes: "We live in a beautiful part of the world, and we have the
resources to do virtually any play that either of us wants to direct.
Why go live out of a suitcase?"</TE>
<TE>   Patch: "Directing in New York would have helped them if they were
going after self-aggrandizement. Has not doing it hurt the theater?
No. Has it cost them personally? Yes, I think."</TE>
<TE>   Benson: "I suppose you're supposed to be ambitious that way, but
our ambitions have been tied here to our own community. I have
enormous ego satisfaction at the success of South Coast Rep."</TE>
<TE>   Will South Coast score a critical and box-office hit with its new
play on its new stage? SCR insiders believe they already know the
answer -- based on the past week's precipitation readings for the
Town Center district of Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Nike Doukas, regular SCR actress: "They always say that if it
rains during tech week, that's a good sign. I don't know why. It's
like an urban legend."</TE>
<TE>   Boussom: "Any time a production has been a success, it rained
during tech week. That's proven itself with very few exceptions."</TE>
<TE>   McFarland: "We will accept anything. One drop will be fine. Mist,
a heavy fog, and we'll be happy. I think Martin started it, but we
all jumped on the bandwagon fairly quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Glore: "I think if a duck spit on you from the roof, that would
count."</TE>
<TE>   The retooled and enlarged South Coast Repertory has the 507-seat
Segerstrom Stage and the new Argyros Stage for regular productions.
The former Second Stage, since 1979 a cozy, 161-seat home to many of
the company's most adventurous plays, is now the Nicholas Studio, a
95-seater reserved for educational programs and that South Coast
hallmark, new play development. A chunk of the money from South
Coast's ongoing $50-million fund-raising campaign -- which has netted
$42.2 million to date -- will bolster the theater's endowment and
launch an initiative to commission and produce new works aimed at
kids and parents. Before they exit, Benson, 65, and Emmes, 63, hope
to mint a new generation of Orange County theater lovers.</TE>
<TE>   Benson: "We have the tools now. It's a complex that meets all our
needs."</TE>
<TE>   Emmes: "In the next five years, SCR is going to write the most
exciting chapter in its history, and we fully intend to be here for
that."</TE>
<TE>   Build a theater and you build a place for stories. They can unfold
on either side of the footlights. This one is told by a fifth-grade
teacher from La Habra who has been a volunteer usher at South Coast
Repertory since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Jenifer MacLowry: "One dear man would bring his elderly mother. He
was always so gentle and solicitous of her, helping her, taking his
time with her and always being patient and staying with her. Each
year she got more and more frail, and one time he came and the seat
was empty. And then I heard this other couple come and say how sorry

<LD>Unlike many theaters in Southern California, South Coast Repertory
doesn't go out of its way to attract big-name celebrities to its

before they were well known from TV or film roles. A sampling:</LD>

<HD>Contours of an era</HD>
<DH>The 'Vital Forms' exhibition evokes mid-20th century art
and design through curving lines and spinning electrons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scarlet Cheng</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The task was daunting -- to capture an American era in a couple of
hundred objects, to trace the mid-20th century in art and design.</LD>
<LD>   Brooklyn Museum of Art curators Brooke Kamin Rapaport and Kevin L.
Stayton eventually settled on 240 artworks and objects in their
exhibition "Vital Forms: American Art and Design in the Atomic Age,
1940-1960," which opened a year ago at the museum and landed in San
Diego last week.</LD>
<LD>   They chose paintings and sculpture by Willem de Kooning, Ellsworth
Kelly and Alexander Calder along with Eva Zeisel china, Claire
McCardell dresses and boomerang-patterned Formica. They found links
between Jackson Pollock's abstractions and a 1953 Corvette; the
Slinky and Eero Saarinen's TWA airport terminal in New York.</LD>
<TE>   "The basic idea is that every time period has a visual expression,
a vanguard aesthetic that was an indicator of the times," says
Rapaport, project director for the exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   And the "vanguard aesthetic" for the Atomic Age? "The softly
curving line, the contour that evokes the human body," writes Stayton
in the book that accompanies the exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as the machine seemed to be the source that informed art and
design between the wars," Stayton adds now, "the rejection of that
coldness in favor of a more naturalistic, biomorphic form seemed to
be what the postwar era had to offer as its most original
contribution."</TE>
<TE>   "People realized that the machine's promise didn't pay off, that
it was destructive as well as creative," Rapaport says. So artists
and designers turned "to shapes based on nature, the human body, back
to the handmade and the man-made."</TE>
<TE>   Not that such a strategy could erase the anxieties of the era, as
many of the works attest.</TE>
<TE>   "No art is produced in a vacuum," Rapaport says, "and the works
we've chosen for this exhibition really relate to the historical
context."As the show was being installed in San Diego, we asked the
two curators to make one more pass at summarizing the era. If they
could choose only two or three objects to make their points, what
would they be? Rapaport, now an independent contemporary art curator,
whittled the artworks to two exemplary pieces. Stayton, a decorative
arts scholar who is currently the Brooklyn museum's chief curator,
selected three objects.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leg Splint (1941-42)</TE>
<TE>   Charles Eames and Ray Eames</TE>
<TE>   Designed for the U.S. military during World War II, it is, to
Stayton, a beautiful embodiment of biomorphic form following function
-- with new technology tossed in. "It encapsulates what so much of
the show is about," he says -- a point where design meets history.</TE>
<TE>   The Eameses pioneered an assembly-line method to mold compound
curves into laminated plywood, and then made it conform to the human
leg. "This wasn't just a search for curvy lines and flashy, strange
shapes," Stayton says. "It really comes out of a search for making
objects that make sense. It's about a search for a practical solution
to a real problem -- how to move a soldier that has a damaged leg. It
looks biomorphic because it is biomorphic."</TE>
<TE>   Ray Eames was so enamored with the medical devices that she
transformed a few into artworks -- the so-called Splint sculptures --
one of which is in the show, as is the device itself.</TE>
<TE>   The Eameses subsequently expanded on the theme in their contoured
mass-produced postwar furniture designs, most famously in their
molded-plywood "potato chip" chairs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   `Predicta' Television Set (1959)</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Walker, Severin Jonassen, and Richard Whipple, Philco
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about biomorphic. Stayton calls Philco's Model 4654 a "big
eye that was looking at you."</TE>
<TE>   The Predicta was simply a television tube encased in a plastic and
brass housing and set atop a pedestal that contained the controls and
a speaker. "It looks like a science-fiction creature, a one-eyed
monster," Stayton says. "Most televisions from this period look like
the rest of your furniture; here is television that is
self-consciously modern. It's not trying to hide what it is, bringing
you this new medium, but at the same time it's a little ominous."In
1950 there were a million television sets in American households; 10
years later, there would be 50 million. "It presents this image in
the American home that begins to homogenize culture," Stayton says.
"It symbolizes the dichotomy between the promise of modern technology
and the parallel threat that it brings."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   `Entombment #1 / The Entombment' (1944)</TE>
<TE>   Mark Rothko</TE>
<TE>   "When we think of Mark Rothko, we usually think of his later large
canvasses, velvety masses of color," Rapaport says. "Here, in the
1940s, he created a number of paintings with Christian content,
focusing on the emotional and psychological complexity of the times."</TE>
<TE>   She considers it a particularly eloquent example of the way
artists rejected the traditional figure -- no longer relevant to the
era's urgent issues -- but still made reference to it.</TE>
<TE>   Painted in the year before V-E Day and Hiroshima, the work "places
survivors grieving over a horizontal figure," says Rapaport of the
composition that echoes Renaissance and Baroque depictions of Christ
taken down from the cross. "Rothko is symbolizing the wartime deaths
of many innocent people with the death of one innocent person,"
Rapaport says. "The colors are very muted earth tones, somber, sad
and grievous."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coffee Urn (1961)</TE>
<TE>   Richard L. Huggins, Gorham Manufacturing Co.</TE>
<TE>   One piece of a matching silver service made for the officers' mess
of the U.S. guided-missile cruiser Long Beach, this urn's "vital
form" is biomorphic-atomic. Stayton points out its humorously bulbous
shape and its more ominous finial, a direct reference to the weaponry
and fuel source on board the cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, that stylized spinning-electron model of the atom
was everywhere. "The period was looking at nuclear energy as this
wonderful thing that was going to save the world, cheap energy and
unbounded benefits for everyone," Stayton says. Meanwhile, it also
held "the menace of total annihilation."</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that I find almost poignant about the object is that it
was so optimistic," he adds, "so light and bubbly and playful, yet it
was made for use on this battleship of war at the height of the Cold
War" -- the Cuban missile crisis came a year after this piece was
designed -- "when the world was on the verge of nuclear destruction."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   `This Tortured Earth' (1943)</TE>
<TE>   Isamu Noguchi</TE>
<TE>   Rapaport calls this 26-by-26-inch bronze model a
"proto-earthwork."</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of sculpting the earth followed me through the years,
with mostly playground models as metaphor, but then there were
others," Noguchi would write in the 1980s, 40 years after creating
this work. " 'This Tortured Earth' was my concept for a large area to
memorialize the tragedy of war. There is injury to the earth itself.
The war machine, I thought, would be excellent equipment for
sculpture, to bomb it into existence."</TE>
<TE>   The scarred and gouged design was never realized in a physical
landscape, but in 1952 Noguchi finished two bridges commemorating war
dead in Peace Park in Hiroshima.</TE>
<TE>   Noguchi makes more than one appearance in "Vital Forms," a fact
Rapaport ties to the versatility of artists in the 1940s and '50s.
His famous amoeboid glass-topped coffee table, designed in 1944 and
back in production as of the mid-1980s, is in a furnishings "suite"
in the San Diego show.</TE>

<HD>An average guy and his angel</HD>
<DH>Santana, with new success, stays grounded when mom preaches
humility. There is also a spiritual entity, he says, who told him to
give back by speaking out about his past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Agustin Gurza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Concord, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Carlos Santana doesn't always act like a spiritualist rock star who
communicates with angels to help him inspire humanity through his
music. Sometimes he lets the mundane irritations of life get to him
too.</LD>
<LD>   A moment ago, he was bristling about the pressures of having his
large family show up for his concert at the Chronicle Pavilion east
of San Francisco, his first hometown appearance in two years.
Siblings and nieces and cousins and their spouses, all clamoring to
get in. That's "emotional chaos" before a performance. So he vows
next time he'll greet relatives after the show, to avoid the
distraction from his job.</LD>
<LD>   Once the clan is settled, though, a serene Santana takes a seat at
a plain patio table with half a dozen members of his inner circle.
He's respectful, leaning close to speak in Spanish with his
gray-haired mother, who's in a wheelchair. He's polite, standing up
to greet his sisters with a kiss on both cheeks.</LD>
<TE>   If the Santanas weren't gathered in this VIP courtyard behind the
stage, they could be any Mexican immigrant family out for a picnic.
Nobody fawns over the brother just coming off a comeback album that
became one of the top-selling records of all time.</TE>
<TE>   "Supernatural," Santana's 1999 release, sold 25 million copies
worldwide, a success so intense it can distort an artist's life, even
change the way he looks. Surely, the "Supernatural" phenomenon must
have altered Santana somehow, at least the way he looks at himself.</TE>
<TE>   "No, man, I'm still the same guy who crossed the border, who was
washing dishes," explains the guitarist, 55, during an interview in
his dressing room. "I'm still my mother's son. I have four sisters
and two brothers. When I go home, I feel like a shrimp that's chopped
and diced like a Benihana by my two daughters and my wife. I still
take the garbage out."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing supernatural about that. Like many an average guy, Santana
has struggled with marital problems. He claims he perceives five
dimensions to human existence, but for a time he was able to show his
family only one: anger.</TE>
<TE>   He had met his wife Deborah at a 1972 Tower of Power concert in
the San Francisco suburb of San Rafael, the city the couple calls
home. She had remained his loyal companion and advisor ever since.
But then came the crisis that threatened to end his marriage of 30
years. In those drifting years before "Supernatural," when his career
was going nowhere and he seemed destined to remain a relic of the
psychedelic '60s, Santana's temper became unbearable. Deborah issued
her husband an ultimatum: Either get help or get out.</TE>
<TE>   Santana consulted a therapist and was forced to confront the
trauma of childhood molestation, which he revealed in February in a
Rolling Stone magazine interview and again last month on "60 Minutes
II." "I adore my wife," says Santana, as lean and longhaired as in
his prime. "I adore my kids. So I felt I had to become brave and have
the courage to go inside the ring and face my bull. You know, face
the moment of truth. And the moment of truth for men who have been
molested is to go see a psychiatrist or an analyst and shed your
skin."</TE>
<TE>   The average man, though, doesn't shed his skin on national
television. That public disclosure is something Santana would have
rather avoided.</TE>
<TE>   But the angel said he must do it.</TE>
<TE>   He has spoken frequently in interviews about the celestial visitor
who shepherded his career revival. At night, when his family is
asleep, Santana lights a candle and waits to hear from the jolly,
white-bearded angel named Metatron.</TE>
<TE>   Metatron inspired his comeback. "Supernatural" wasn't magical,
though. Santana's worldly moves made it happen. He wiggled out of
record contracts he considered stagnating, and he searched out his
old mentor Clive Davis, who had originally signed him to Columbia
Records in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Davis came up with the idea of finding fresh songs and young
collaborators for Santana, an approach they're reprising on "Shaman,"
the recently released follow-up album, which soared toward No. 1 in
its first week of release.</TE>
<TE>   To Santana, both albums have a spiritual mission: one
accomplished, one to go.</TE>
<TE>   Spiritual warrior</TE>
<TE>   In the dressing room, he pops open a bottle of beer, sinks into a
comfortable couch and explains.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, the first message was to stop the shootings in schools,
which obviously have stopped," he says. "That was the first message
for 'Supernatural,' and the last [time] people were shot was at
Santana High School in San Diego."</TE>
<TE>   He states the stunning claim with nonchalance. It's up to the
listener to connect cause with effect -- his comeback album was
released the year of the Columbine High School massacre, then came a
lull in shootings after the Santee incident at a school with his name
on it.</TE>
<TE>   Santana simply calls the coincidence "fascinating." Later, talking
about something else, he says that coincidence is one way that
spirits reveal themselves.</TE>
<TE>   They also deliver messages directly. At the peak of the
"Supernatural" phenomenon, Santana heard Metatron, the angel, say:
"We've given you an enormous experience, and we want something back.
We want you to speak about your child molestation."</TE>
<TE>   That was a message he didn't want to hear. "At first, I was
horrified I would have to open that part of me so personal. And I
couldn't sleep for days." Santana tried to negotiate with the
spirits.</TE>
<TE>   "And they said, 'No, it's not for bargaining, because a lot of men
are going to benefit from it. And sure enough, I started getting
e-mails and men crying, different men from all over the world,
saying, 'It happened to me, too, and we commend you for being so
brave.' As soon as I said that, like a domino effect, all of a sudden
all these men started coming out about all the molestations with
priests."</TE>
<TE>   As outlandish as some of this might sound to the average fan,
Santana has always said that artists have the power to change the
world. "If you're not doing that, then you should be a plumber. Do
something else."</TE>
<TE>   But has he started to take himself too seriously? Even the title
of the new album sounds self-aggrandizing, as if he were anointing
himself as the grand shaman, healer of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife warned me people would take it like that," he says. "But
I don't have illusions of grandeur, man. I'm not saying I'm Superman
or Batman or Jesus or Buddha. But I am saying we all have powers that
we're not using."</TE>
<TE>   Outside on the patio, Santana leans over to give his mother a soft
kiss. It's time for him to start the show. In his pocket he carries a
handwritten statement that he and his wife drafted the night before.
He intends to read it during the concert, announcing "Shaman's"
spiritual mission.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, with 'Shaman' we can invite people to ... " Santana
pauses. "To see the big picture. When you see the big picture you
say, 'God bless humanity.' You don't say, 'God bless America.'</TE>
<TE>   "I adore this country and everything. It's been really good to me.
But I will not say 'Sieg Heil' in the name of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Santana knows that his adoring Bay Area audience will be receptive
to his antiwar message. From the stage, he calls on President Bush to
soften his heart and "see that the highest goal of life is compassion
and goodness."</TE>
<TE>   He pulls out the paper and reads his rock sermon.</TE>
<TE>   "Spiritual warriors are the architects of today," he declares. "By
faith they make the invisible visible."</TE>
<TE>   'M'hijo, remember ... '</TE>
<TE>   Even as a boy, Carlos seemed special to his mother, Josefina
Barragan de Santana. He was her middle child, born in the Mexican
state of Jalisco. He stood out because his lips were full and red and
his complexion was lighter than the others, considered a blessing in
Mexico's color-based society.</TE>
<TE>   But his spirit seemed special, too. "Carlos has a big angel," his
aunt would say, meaning his life was charmed. "The boy is going to
grow up to be a bishop," she told his mother. "He's going to preach
to the multitudes."</TE>
<TE>   To this day, Mrs. Santana makes sure her son doesn't stray from
what she taught him. First and foremost: Be humble and be afraid of
money.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, Carlos calls her from the road and tells her how well
things are going. People are flocking to see him, and he tells her
how much money he's made.</TE>
<TE>   "M'hijo, remember that every time the good Lord gives you much,
you have to feel even smaller."</TE>
<TE>   "Mami, you've told me that many times," says the musician, who
once realized that certain of his solos are tuned to the sound of his
mother's scoldings.</TE>
<TE>   "Just in case you forget," she tells him. "I don't like people who
are vain and egotistical. I don't want you to take your feet off the
ground and blow up like a balloon."</TE>
<TE>   That's precisely why Santana doesn't hire somebody to throw out
the garbage for him.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I don't want people around in my house all the time," he says
with a trace of annoyance. "I'm not surrounded by a bunch of people
to protect me like that, man, and to do everything for me. That's how
you lose perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Backstage, Santana calls to his daughter Angelica. "H-i-i-i-i-i,
precious," he says. "Come on in. Say hi to me."</TE>
<TE>   The sassy 12-year-old at first ignores the call, then bolts
through the door. "You're my biggest fan," she says, cocking her head
as if she were the celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   Santana looks stunned, leans back and laughs. He seems to enjoy
being put in his place. And Metatron is probably smiling too.</TE>

<LD>Clive Davis knew the gods and the odds were against another
"Supernatural," Santana's phenomenal 1999 bestseller. "People would
say, 'Oh, this could never happen again; lightning could not strike
twice,' " said the fabled label executive, who first signed Carlos
Santana's band to Columbia Records in 1968 and masterminded his
comeback 30 years later for Arista. "We just said, 'Look, we will not
be intimidated by the all-time success of "Supernatural." ' "</LD>
<LD>   For "Shaman," released Oct. 22, Davis stuck to the "blueprint"
that worked "Supernatural" magic. Santana picked half the songs to
suit his style and Davis picked half to suit radio formats, all
pairing the veteran guitarist with young collaborators. They wound up
with so much material this time -- 50 songs -- that Santana for a
while wanted a double album. There's still talk of an all-Spanish
release.</LD>
<LD>   One that didn't make the new album, though everybody loved it, was
called "Your Satellite," written by Rob Thomas and sung by salsa-pop
star Marc Anthony. "Marc was on fire, and the chemistry was amazing,"
producer Lester Mendez said. "Clive was not letting that one go." But
Santana said contractual problems between record labels (Anthony is
with Columbia) eventually scuttled "Satellite."</LD>
<TE>   As for expectations of matching the 25 million worldwide sales of
"Supernatural," Davis says: "People will be surprised that we can get
anywhere near it. And I sort of like that surprise."</TE>

<LD>Calendar's guide to a healthy pop music diet on a monthly budget of
$50 is distinguished this time by a Beck album that may end up as the
best of the year and an Elvis Presley compilation that is among the
half-dozen most notable albums ever.</LD>
<LD>   September</LD>
<LD>   Beck's "Sea Change" (Geffen). Every decade produces a handful of
albums so personal and poignant that they stick with you forever.
Here's one -- a story of loss and recovery that reflects the ache of
Hank Williams' "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry."</LD>
<TE>   Elvis Presley's "Sunrise" (RCA). "Elvis: 30 No. 1 Hits" may have
topped the charts, but this survey of Elvis' earlier days on Sun
Records (complete with live and alternate versions) is as close as
you can come on disc to the birth of rock 'n' roll as we know it.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Adams' "Demolition" (Lost Highway). This informal batch of
demo tracks from four unreleased albums melds together beautifully,
giving us the most intimate and fully satisfying solo package from
the young hotshot alt-country singer-songwriter.</TE>
<TE>   October</TE>
<TE>   The Streets' "Original Pirate Material" (Vice). Who would have
figured the freshest rap voice of the year would come from London?
Mike Skinner, the 23-year-old known as the Streets, deals in
street-level storytelling that is as distinctive as it is urgent.</TE>
<TE>   Mali Music's "Mali Music" (Astralwerks/Honest Jon's). Blur's Damon
Albarn gives us a scrapbook of the music he recorded with local
musicians in Mali and then augmented with various contemporary
touches back in England. The Mali Visit Social Club?</TE>
<TE>   Hot Hot Heat's "Make Up the Breakdown" (Sub Pop). Here's the ideal
opening act for the Hives, and they're not even Swedish. The Canadian
foursome's excitable and accessible punk style is extra-furious and
extra-fun. Steve Bays sounds like David Bowie on fast-forward.</TE>

<HD>Secession or no, Valley is hesitant to embrace its art</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the opening frames of "Punch-Drunk Love," Paul Thomas Anderson's
cockeyed new romantic fable, a nebbishy, passive-aggressive
toilet-supplies salesman named Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) stands by
the curb of a generic San Fernando Valley thoroughfare, sipping his
morning coffee. We seem to be watching an ordinary man in a prosaic
landscape where nothing of consequence ever happens.</LD>
<LD>   Then -- violently, unexpectedly, unfathomably -- something does.
As Barry's staid existence collides head-on with chaos, this gawky,
insular being is forced to look deeper into himself until finally he
discovers a new identity buried in the wreckage of his own past.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, something big and potentially life-changing could
happen in the Valley, which for nearly a century has chafed in
bit-player roles, metaphorically serving as grudging makeup girl and
best boy to the self-absorbed glamour-pusses Over the Hill. But, as
with the events that befall Barry Egan, it's still a tossup whether
this change will be a heaven-sent boon or a curse in disguise.</LD>
<TE>   Barry, an awkward boy-man whose skittish mix of naivete and
resourcefulness, sweetness and explosive anger suggests he's either a
grandson of Buster Keaton or a distant cousin of Pee-wee Herman,
desperately yearns to be treated like a grown-up. But he's nervous
about the duties of adulthood. All his life he has defined himself by
his seven sisters' mostly dismissive and patronizing impressions of
him. When finally forced to stand on his own feet, he rises,
painfully but triumphantly, to the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   So, too, may the new city of San Fernando Valley or Camelot or
whatever it's called, if secession passes. Do the separatists have a
case? You bet they do. Subpar services and a distant City Hall
bureaucracy are only part of the story. What really galls
Secessionistas is the sense that the rest of L.A. looks down its nose
at the Valley while happily pocketing its property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of rushing to sever its umbilical attachment to its
overbearing metropolitan Mommie Dearest, the Valley maybe should
concentrate on nurturing its unique cultural identity, regardless of
outsiders' perceptions and prejudices. Louise Lewis, director of Cal
State Northridge's art galleries since 1980, says she hasn't yet made
up her mind about secession. But she thinks that the Valley should
focus more on its assets than on what it lacks or what nonresidents
think -- just as postwar Los Angeles needed to shake free of East
Coast expectations so as to become the self-possessed city it is
today.</TE>
<TE>   How can the Valley develop a positive self-image if it's
constantly in "reactionary" mode, promoting itself "in terms of what
we're not getting?" Lewis asks rhetorically. "I don't think enough
attention to that has been given by the [secession] movement."</TE>
<TE>   Culturally the Valley already has plenty of assets, some in plain
view, others requiring time to discover. That's why the Los Angeles
Conservancy has begun sponsoring tours of the area's Googie-style
architecture. That's why the North Hollywood NoHo Arts District is
recognized for producing some of the region's best small theater.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley is home to three filmmaking giants: Walt Disney, Jack
Warner and Carl Laemmle at Universal, who parlayed chutzpah, genius
and an understanding of the American public that any politician would
envy into sprawling entertainment empires. Another great filmmaker,
Sergei Eisenstein, might well have designed the Warner Center, the
Valley's Potemkin urban nexus.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is there any sign that the Valley's home-grown talent pool,
unlike William Mulholland's water supply, is in any danger of running
out. Take the aforementioned P.T. Anderson, a mild-mannered Valley
native who's rapidly morphing into the Louis Malle of Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The late Phil Hartman once joked to a Daily News reporter that
when he identified himself as a Valley resident to industry
colleagues from Over the Hill, he could see them back away so as not
to get "loser dust" over their designer duds. But in actuality,
thousands of industry professionals make their homes in the Valley,
having found they don't have to be bound by simplistic divisions of
urban versus suburban, hipster versus homebody.</TE>
<TE>   That's the brilliant duality of the Valley, its split personality,
its internal yin and yang. It's the world's porn capital, yet many
triple-X moguls choose to live in bland tract homes and conduct
themselves as model suburbanites. It's the place where the old, Ayn
Rand-style libertarian mind-set jostles with a new set of progressive
political imperatives brought by waves of immigrants from Asia,
Mexico, Central America.</TE>
<TE>   It's a giant sound stage where sociological dramas play out daily,
where the Brady Bunch home symbolized '60s family values and
Hollywood's paranoid fantasies blurred into the terrifying spectacle
of the 1997 North Hollywood bank shootout.</TE>
<TE>   Some of us even find the Valley's lack of pretensions refreshing,
preferable to the relentless boosterism of L.A.'s civic fathers and
their relentless chatter about our weird, effusive metropolis as the
"City of the 21st Century."</TE>
<TE>   But as author D.J. Waldie ("Holy Land: A Suburban Memoir") has
written, the secession backers may be peddling their own form of
boosterism. What they're selling, he observes, is a new version of
paradise to replace the supposedly lost paradise of acre-sized lots
studded with orange trees and uncrowded freeways, which lured
Midwestern interlopers here in decades past.</TE>
<TE>   Human beings, however, weren't built for paradise. Sooner or later
we all have to exit Eden and go rough it on our own. Practically from
the year of its invention, the Valley has languished in a state of
arrested development, trapped between its preternatural growth spurts
and L.A.'s benign neglect. But culturally the Valley has already come
of age. Whatever happens on Tuesday, the secession debate
demonstrates that the Valley is of age politically too.</TE>
<TE>   Let provincials Over the Hill stick to Brentwood and Silver Lake
for now. Word will spread. They'll eventually find out what they're
missing.</TE>
<TE>   In "Punch-Drunk Love," Barry's salvation lies in discovering that
he's not as isolated from love or the rest of humanity as he'd always
believed. But before gaining his independence he first must accept
his interdependence.</TE>
<TE>   Smart concept. Good movie. Don't forget to vote.</TE>

<HD>Helping dance presenters make a global leap</HD>
<DH>A consortium allows small venues to land cutting-edge Latin
American artists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Victoria Looseleaf</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Money in the arts is tight right now, no doubt about it. Orchestras
are grappling with deficits, the highflying Guggenheim has traded
global ambitions for layoffs and exhibition cancellations, and
everywhere there is the specter of belts tightening, horizons
narrowing.</LD>
<LD>   Except when they're not. Creative financing -- and making common
cause -- combined with reasonable ambitions can still open previously
closed doors. Los Angeles has been designated a site for one such
program, whose stated aim is to erase borders up and down the Western
Hemisphere.</LD>
<LD>   Performing Americas links three nonprofit presenting organizations
-- New Orleans-based National Performance Network, LA Red in
Venezuela and New York's Arts International -- in introducing
cutting-edge Latin American performing arts to the U.S. and vice
versa.</LD>
<TE>   The consortium has included Highways Performance Space, in Santa
Monica, as its West Coast venue. Known for presenting
off-the-beaten-path performances, Highways will help introduce the
Argentine dance- theater company Grupo Krapp to the U.S. in a
residency that includes performances Thursday through Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Brazell, Highways artistic director, says that without
Performing Americas, she wouldn't have had the means to present a
Latin American company as part of its North American debut tour.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a small organization, and because we work with
contemporary, alternative, socially relevant work, there isn't much
funding available for what we do. The benefit for Highways is that it
enables us to participate on an international level that can directly
contribute to our local artistic community. When you do this kind of
exchange, these artists inspire dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   According to MK Wegmann, chief executive of the National
Performance Network, the program grew out of the consortium's
dedication to presenting new and emerging performing artists. Her
organization helps fund such performances at 55 member-venues in 26
states; LA Red does much the same thing in Latin America; and Arts
International does it worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "LA Red is modeled on National Performance Network," she explains,
"and we'd wanted to work together. Arts International approached both
of us and said they were interested in helping facilitate a formal
exchange of artists. We began to design one based on a mutual
partnership -- artists from the U.S. and artists from Latin America
would be included in the exchange." This is the program's inaugural
season.</TE>
<TE>   Criteria for choosing the performers, Wegmann says, are based on
the content of the artistic work and the artists' willingness to tour
in a residency context. In addition, company size was taken into
consideration, with eight or nine members the maximum.</TE>
<TE>   To select the two Latin American companies for this season's tour,
Wegmann was part of a curatorial panel that looked at about 25
different ensembles at festivals in South America. Besides Grupo
Krapp, a Chilean musical ensemble was chosen to tour the U.S., and
the dance troupe Jane Comfort and Company, from New York, and the
movement theater ensemble Shawn McConneloug and her Orquestra, from
Minneapolis, will be spending three weeks in Brazil and Central
America, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The venues in the U.S. are all members of National Performance
Network. Of the dozen that applied to be part of Performing Americas,
six were chosen -- three to present music and three dance. Besides
Highways, the other dance presenters are in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "We chose Highways because of the range and quality of the work
they present, as well as their connection to community," says
Wegmann. "They are a new presenter of international work and part of
the motivation for this project is to encourage people to take on
presenting international work."</TE>
<TE>   Brazell says her involvement began in 2001 when she went to an NPN
conference. "Highways is honored to be chosen," she says. There isn't
an easy way to make international contacts, she points out, and the
network sponsorship not only helps defray costs of production, it
helps with the increasingly difficult and costly process of securing
visas. Bottom line? "NPN gives artists we might not otherwise be able
to present the opportunity to tour."</TE>
<TE>   Wegmann says that the overall budget for the program is $120,000,
with National Performance Network subsidizing the contracts at the
national level and individual presenters coming up with matching
funds in order to cover their costs for the residencies and
performances. Highways received about $10,000 from the consortium,
with money designated for travel, per diem and a set fee per dancer
for a week. Brazell raised her matching funds from the City of Santa
Monica Community Arts Program, California Presenters Initiative and
TourWest.</TE>
<TE>   Explains Brazell: "It's been a challenge, but funders get excited
when you're doing this kind of exchange, as this affects our local
community. Grupo Krapp is young, out of Buenos Aires, and their work
is very strong, very exciting.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the workshops they're doing," Brazell adds, "is in a
predominantly Latino working-class neighborhood." They'll be
interacting with young adults in a program through the Pico Family
Youth Service Center. The other workshop is for dancers and members
of the performance art community.</TE>
<TE>   Wegmann says Performing Americas is intended to continue for five
years. Brazell has been selected to participate in next year's
curatorial panel, and one of her missions is to get a Los
Angeles-based company on the next tour. "The challenges [of bringing
in new acts] are sometimes insurmountable," Brazell points out, "but
the benefits -- when the project actually happens, when you see
artists working in the community -- make it worthwhile. It's
inspiring."</TE>

<LD>Grupo Krapp, founded in 1995 and headed by choreographers Luciana
Acuna and Luis Biasotto, takes its name from Samuel Beckett's
character in the tragicomic one-act play "Krapp's Last Tape," in
which a man reviews a record of his life. The eight-member company of
dancers, actors and musicians has created its own brand of subversive
movement language meant to match Beckett's absurd vision.</LD>
<LD>   "The Krapp character deals primarily with difficult themes such as
violence, seduction, desire, hypocrisy and taboos," say Acuna and
Biasotto, via e-mail from Buenos Aires. "We develop physical
movements and theatrical situations identifying our work with this."</LD>
<LD>   On the Highways bill, expect to see "psychotic but endearing"
characters in the 2001 work "No Me Besabas?" (Weren't You Kissing
Me?), in which the everyday turns Kafkaesque. The music combines
Argentine dance boleros, Cuban son and techno-house rhythms; the
choreography and staging include body slamming, boxing, acrobatics,
acting and dialogue. "Rio Seco" (Dry River), the other concert work,
draws inspiration from family vacations. However, the directors say
the piece is "anything but bucolic."</LD>

<DH>The crew of 'Eye on L.A.,' a precursor to today's 'reality'
genre, bares its inner secrets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before the networks showcased Victoria's Secret lingerie models in
prime time, there was the "3-D Hawaiian Swimsuit Spectacular." Before
"Temptation Island," there were explorations of bare flesh and nude
beaches and bigamy. Before Anna Nicole Smith preened for TV cameras,
there were segments featuring poster girl Angelyne -- all available
six nights a week, on "Eye on L.A."</LD>
<LD>   Reeling in viewers with an intoxicating mix of sex, titillation,
adventure and gaudy promotion (and did we mention sex?), the local
magazine-style show filled the half-hour leading into prime time on
KABC-TV through the 1980s -- thriving in the days when TV stations
still cranked out local shows, before those time periods became home
to nationally syndicated programs like "Wheel of Fortune" and
"Oprah."</LD>
<LD>   Yet while "Eye" was shut more than a decade ago (KABC still uses
the title on a more subdued half-hour program airing Saturdays), the
show was the incubator for a generation of producers who have taken
tricks they learned there and now ply them on a national stage.</LD>
<TE>   "Almost every 'reality' show on the air, we did some version of on
'Eye on L.A.,' " said alumnus Jeff Androsky, whose producing credits
include Fox's recent "Celebrity Daredevils" special and that
network's live stunt shows featuring motorcyclist Robbie Knievel.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the ratings-driven hucksterism the show shamelessly
trafficked in years ago has permeated today's airwaves -- with
desperate times, or at least an increasingly crowded TV environment,
demanding desperate measures.</TE>
<TE>   "At KABC, you could get away with virtually anything, because it
was the most rating-conscious place you would ever be in your life,"
said fellow "Eye" graduate Mack Anderson, producer of the
long-running Comedy Central series "BattleBots." "If you want to get
to the broader issues of what's happening in reality television, the
same thing is happening now -- the fact that there is intense ratings
pressure, and suddenly networks are saying, 'Just do something, as
long as it works.' "</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, "Eye" is gone but hardly forgotten. The show's
progeny now produce a wide array of today's unscripted series,
including E!'s "The Anna Nicole Show" and "The E! True Hollywood
Story," NBC's "Meet My Folks" and a lengthy roster of Fox fare such
as "American Idol," "America's Most Wanted," "Boot Camp" and "Looking
for Love: Bachelorettes in Alaska."</TE>
<TE>   What better way, then, to chart the rise (or, depending on one's
viewpoint, spread) of unscripted programming than to dig into its
roots, with half a dozen of "Eye's" senior producers -- Anderson,
Androsky, Don Cambou, Michael J. Miller, Erik Nelson and Eric Schotz
-- acting as tour guides and archeologists?</TE>
<TE>   These producers, along with their fellow alumni, have become some
of the most prolific dabblers in the so-called reality genre. Most
are competitors now, vying for precious time periods on the networks
that buy such programs, and like the bosses in "The Godfather," they
pressed for the meeting to take place on neutral turf.</TE>
<TE>   After a bit of haggling, they agreed to gather at the old KABC lot
on Prospect Avenue in Los Angeles where they assembled the show in
the '80s. KABC has relocated, and the bungalow "Eye on L.A." called
home has been reduced to a dirt pile.</TE>
<TE>   As metaphors go, the bungalow's fate is a pretty good one for what
happened to local television shows after the 1980s, as stations
slashed in-house production. According to the producers, however,
"Eye" lives on.</TE>
<TE>   "You can find pieces of it everywhere," said Schotz, whose company
has been responsible for "Boot Camp," "Bachelorettes in Alaska,"
"Guinness World Records: Prime Time," as well as "Behind Closed Doors
With Joan Lunden." "When we were on, MTV was just starting. We were
doing music videos before MTV went on the air."</TE>
<TE>   Relegated to a sterile conference room a short distance from where
the "Eye" offices stood, the session turns out to be part class
reunion, part one-upmanship by seasoned salesmen -- a free-flowing
discussion of the current state of their art, peppered liberally with
obscure references to incidents only they remember and former
colleagues whose mere mention elicits laughs or knowing grins.</TE>
<TE>   The tone is nostalgic but far from maudlin. These are men, after
all, who frequently earn their living by capturing life's oddities,
whether through hidden cameras or by persuading people to put
themselves in bizarre situations for the entertainment of a vast
audience at home. For apprehensive networks, they offer the promise
of eye-catching fare that won't cost an arm and a leg -- good food at
reasonable prices.</TE>
<TE>   The old days were easier, they agree -- the TV environment less
stressful and uncertain, and more fun. People made money even in
failure, and stations invested in local production -- providing a
training ground for these producers as well as a bond with the
community that dissipated as nationally produced and syndicated fare
supplanted it.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the idea that a locally produced show dominated the
early-evening ratings might be hard to fathom for those who don't
remember the days before Alex Trebek met "Jeopardy!," but such local
programming was common. In fact, "Eye on L.A." competed head to head
with "2 on the Town," a more stately magazine on KCBS-TV, and the
competition was fierce.</TE>
<TE>   During rating sweeps, the gloves -- and often other clothing --
came off, with segments like "Nude Beaches of the World" (creatively
shot to obscure vital areas) and the "3-D Swimsuit Spectacular," with
viewers picking up the necessary glasses at 7-Eleven stores.</TE>
<TE>   If the actual effect was iffy, viewership soared. KCBS countered
with an in-depth report about the Philippines; few people watched. "2
on the Town" executive producer Michael Meadows said at the time, "We
tried to do a meaningful show, and we got crushed by bodies."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping it real</TE>
<TE>   THE subsequent success of the show's alumni -- and the
anything-goes nature of TV's "reality" -- suggests that the lessons
were taken to heart. In addition to the six participants, a partial
list includes Teya Ryan, general manager of CNN, as well as producers
Brian Gadinsky ("American Idol"), Jeff Shore ("Anna Nicole"), Michael
Linder ("America's Most Wanted"), and Rob Kirk and Rob Lihani,
partners in the multimedia production company Digital Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Other "Eye" graduates are writer-producer Bryce Zabel, chairman of
the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences; Paul Hall, producer of the
recent feature "Shaft"; and commercial director David Kellogg, who
also directed the movie "Inspector Gadget." As for on-air talent, the
show drew liberally from KABC's newsroom, including Paul Moyer, Chuck
Henry and Jann Carl.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, almost all of the "Eye" staff was young and willing
to work insane hours. "It was not unusual to work 24 or 36 hours
straight, and then we would brag about it in some misguided, macho
way," said Anderson, a soft-spoken fellow who dryly notes that he
always knew their would be an audience for fighting robots -- the
conceit behind "BattleBots" -- in the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   The producers describe "Eye" as a graduate school, but it also
operated as a sort-of fraternity. Schotz, for example, recalls having
staff call "2 on the Town" anonymously trying to ferret out its
sweeps scheduling and sending flowers to the executive who oversaw
the show with a birthday wish from her boss, even though it wasn't
her birthday.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Eye on L.A.' was like a laboratory, and for a while, the
inmates were allowed to run the asylum," said Cambou, who the past
five years has headed Hearst Corp.'s Actuality production unit,
supervising installments of "Biography," "Intimate Portraits" and
"Modern Marvels," among others.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the battle with "2 on the Town," producers competed among
themselves for "plums" -- from the most exotic trips to the best
office and parking spot. Marathon production schedules made working
on the show resemble a medical internship, as pieces were frequently
completed hours before they went on the air.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all 25 and worked to the edge of what we could do," said
Miller, who speaks in clipped bursts and still seems to possess a
vast reservoir of energy, having worked with producer Bruce Nash on
NBC's "Meet My Folks" and "World's Most Amazing Videos," along with a
host of specials.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like being in a MASH unit in Korea," he mused. "It really
was. I didn't go to graduate school, but this was it."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the producers were new to Los Angeles. For some, it was
their first job in television. Androsky was working in Louisville,
Ky., when he came out hoping to join the staff. "They sent me to do a
story on the Raiderettes. I spent four days planning it. That day, I
was told, 'Forget the Raiderettes. There's a stripper convention in
Las Vegas. You're leaving in an hour.' I shot it that night, was back
the next day, edited it, and as I was leaving they said, 'Hey, you
want the job?' "</TE>
<TE>   As with many of the "reality" or alternative programs that
followed, critics routinely pummeled the show -- dismissing its
emphasis on beaches and bikinis as "Eye on T&amp;A." KABC officials
brushed them off, saying those initials must stand for "travel and
adventure."</TE>
<TE>   The show's promotion matched the cheekiness of its content. Ghosts
conveniently turned up at L.A.'s purported haunted spots -- but only
during sweeps and only if you watched the segments. An episode in
which Liberace gave viewers a tour of his clothing collection was
billed as "Inside Liberace's Closet -- Tonight at 7:30!" "Everybody
watched it, and it was about dry cleaning!" said Miller.</TE>
<TE>   "It sort of functioned like a 1950s exploitive studio, where they
would come up with the poster first, and then Roger Corman would
crank out the movie second," said Nelson, the producer of such
hidden-camera shows as UPN's "Redhanded" and MTV's "Celebrity
Undercover," along with the specials "World's Most Dangerous Animals"
and "When Chefs Attack." "The show taught you to think in log lines
and full-page ads, which isn't a bad skill to take into the
hurly-burly of television."</TE>
<TE>   Added Anderson: "It was one of the loudest TV shows that has ever
been produced -- by loud, I mean from a promotional point of view,
from a catch-your-attention point of view.... Frankly, now, whenever
you go in to pitch a show, you really do have to convince whoever the
buyer is that what you're going to do is going to have an impact, and
the way to make an impact in a really crowded television market is by
being loud."</TE>
<TE>   How loud? A production log from 1984 reveals such topics as "Nude
Art Models," "Stripper Convention," "Voodoo" and "Bigamy" -- and
that's just during a two-week stretch in the February rating sweeps.</TE>
<TE>   "This show was about creating events," Schotz said. "That is the
one thing that I took away when you walk in and try to sell something
to a network. Whether it was doing 'Nude Beaches of the World' or
'3-D Swimsuits' or 'Around the World in Eight Days,' we were able to
sit there and say, 'How do you sell this as an event?' '... You'd
walk away and figure out how to take something simple and blow it up
and make it huge."</TE>
<TE>   Given that contestants on some of today's unscripted programs sign
50-page waivers, "Eye on L.A." also operated with remarkable freedom,
seldom worrying about the legal clearances corporate attorneys
presently demand.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearances? Yeah, right. Like we were going to [legally] clear
somebody," Schotz said. "It didn't have all the weight that you have
today."</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we learned at 'Eye on L.A.,' which is an
important component in creating modern reality television, is that
ordinary people will do anything to be on television," Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Local shows fade from view</TE>
<TE>   ANOTHER modern shift is that few TV stations devote significant
resources to local production anymore; instead, media conglomerates
own ever larger station groups, buying programs that play across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no local television anymore," Miller said. "There was a
25-year era of local TV, where stations believed they needed to have
local programming to serve the public, and it ended pretty much when
this show ended. Now they just put on 'Wheel of Fortune' reruns, and
one fat guy downstairs pushes a 'start' button on a tape machine."</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, "Eye on L.A." produced 130 to 140 episodes a year,
running six nights a week. Miller contrasted that with today, when
networks order six episodes of a new series and producers always feel
as if they're on the verge of being canceled. "Because of that, we
could afford to take enormous risks," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the show was extremely popular, its death warrant was
essentially signed in 1986, when buttoned-up Capital Cities acquired
ABC. At the time, KABC produced an original magazine show in the
afternoon ("330"), three hours of local news, "Eye on L.A.,"
"Hollywood Close-Up" and "Eye on Hollywood" -- essentially a
repackaged version of "Eye on L.A." segments that ran late at night
on the network.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, those programs began to disappear. "Eye" was outsourced
and eventually replaced by syndicated programming. "When Capital
Cities took over, there were 135 employees here in the local
programming department," Anderson recalled. "Within a year, there
were six. Literally, they didn't want people on the payroll."</TE>
<TE>   "Now the whole country has turned into one major television
market," Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like AM radio," Miller added. "It used to be every city had
their own station and personality. Now you can drive coast to coast
and it's the same show."</TE>
<TE>   Today, economic forces combined with the appetite for something
new to stand apart from the crowd has led to alternative programs
occupying large swaths of prime-time real estate. Still, the
producers agree that the TV business was easier back in their
formative years -- or at least, it seems that way in hindsight.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was at 'Eye on L.A.,' I naively thought talent was easy,
and I think it was because everyone around me was talented," Cambou
said. "Now that I have to find talent, it's hard. There's not that
much of it out there."</TE>
<TE>   "Especially not for this kind of stuff, where you have to really
get it at some level and have no shame," Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   There is a consensus among them, too, that there was something
refreshingly unpretentious about KABC in those years -- a station
that didn't aspire to high art or spend much time defending its
excesses.</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, "Eye on L.A." was a harbinger of things to come
-- a show that unabashedly exemplified the "Just win" attitude
programmers have come to adopt. Parlaying skin and celebrity into
ratings, the show was not only a microcosm of L.A. in the 1980s but
also a petri dish for the various strains of "reality" that have
followed.</TE>
<TE>   The producers who cut their teeth in that since-leveled bungalow,
meanwhile, seemingly learned to laugh at the business' absurdities
and not take themselves too seriously. Sure, they provide programs
that critics often deride and networks sometimes seem to treat like
unwanted stepchildren, but faced with the din of competition and
criticism, they know how to make noise.</TE>
<TE>   "KABC gave people what they really wanted to watch, not what
people thought they wanted to watch," Nelson said. "The audience knew
there was a P. T. Barnum aspect to it. It was done with a
nudge-nudge, wink-wink. Everyone was in on the joke.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Eye on L.A.' was many things, but it was not overthought," he
said. "Los Angeles got the show it deserved."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Eye on L.A." was a breeding ground for today's popular reality-based
programming.</LD>
<LD>   A look at what some of its senior producers ended up doing:</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Androsky produced motorcyclist Robbie Knievel's live "death
jump" specials for Fox as well as that network's recent "Celebrity
Daredevils," featuring stunts by the likes of Lorenzo Lamas and Angie
Everhart. At "Eye on L.A.," "A lot of the time ... we would go in and
ask to see the TV Guide ad," he said, then tailor the show to match
it.</LD>
<TE>   Mack Anderson has produced the syndicated video show "Maximum
Exposure" and Comedy Central's long-running "BattleBots," which
features dueling robots. "At KABC, you could get away with virtually
anything, because it was the most ratings-conscious place you would
ever be in your life. You got a report card every day with the
ratings."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Miller has worked on a wide variety of unscripted programs,
from a Michael Jackson CBS special to teaming with producer Bruce
Nash on NBC's "Meet My Folks," and the clip-oriented "Totally Hidden
Video" and "World's Most Amazing Videos" for Fox and NBC,
respectively: "I didn't go to graduate school, but this was it."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Schotz produced CBS' "How'd They Do That?," "Behind Closed
Doors With Joan Lunden" and the Fox series "Boot Camp," "Guinness
World Records" and "Looking for Love: Bachelorettes in Alaska." "This
show was about creating events. That is the one thing that I took
away when you walk in and try to sell something."</TE>
<TE>   Erik Nelson has produced a number of hidden-camera or
"clip-umentary" shows, including "Redhanded" and "When Chefs Attack"

<HD>This messiah rocks</HD>
<DH>Sebastian Bach, ex-Skid Row singer, picks up a new cross as
lead in 'Jesus Christ Superstar.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Boehm</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about crossing over. For the next nine months or more, Sebastian
Bach metal dude is going to be transformed eight times a week into
Jesus Christ Superstar.</LD>
<LD>   The former singer of Skid Row cut a swath in the late '80s and
early '90s as one of hard rock's most profane and unbridled wild
boys. Now, at 34, he is continuing his out-of-the-blue parallel life
as a star in Broadway musicals. He plays the perplexed, just-a-man,
dog-whistle-tenor-singing Jesus in a touring production of the Andrew
Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice rock opera that opened Friday at La Mirada
Theatre for the Performing Arts and is scheduled to travel the
country at least through July.</LD>
<LD>   Bach, still a touring rocker when not otherwise engaged, emerged
as Broadway 'Bastian in 2000, when he spent four months playing the
twin leads in "Jekyll &amp; Hyde." The rocker, who claims more than 20
million worldwide album sales, hadn't dreamed of doing musical
theater. But when the "Jekyll" producers needed a new star, Jason
Flom, the Atlantic Records executive who signed Skid Row, tossed
Bach's name into the hat. Bach, who grew up in Peterborough, Canada,
collecting horror and fantasy comics, seized the chance.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, he spent two months on Broadway as Riff-Raff in "The
Rocky Horror Show." Now he gets to hang on a cross, clad in nothing
but a loincloth -- and plenty of body paint to cover the raving demon
tattooed on his left forearm and the "Youth Gone Wild" and "Carpe
Diem" mottoes drilled into the right.</TE>
<TE>   In person, Bach comes off as Jesus Christ Puppy-Dog -- 6 feet, 3
inches of long-limbed energy and enthusiasm devoted to making the
moment enjoyable for himself and those around him.</TE>
<TE>   But he was infamous in 1989, when he cracked a girl's skull with a
bottle he'd flung angrily into a concert crowd in Springfield, Mass.
And, despite many subsequent apologies, he still hasn't completely
lived down the episode that same year when he was photographed
wearing a T-shirt with a homophobic slogan.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in an interview, Bach shows that he can be as engaging as he
once seemed outrageous: a clasper of shoulders, a tapper of knees and
a bestower of big parting bear hugs. He claps his hands, lets out a
wheezy laugh and throws his head back merrily when he comes up with a
bon mot, such as: "When I was a kid, Black Sabbath was as heavy and
evil as you could get, and now they're playing for the queen -- and
Sebastian Bach is Jesus Christ. The Lord works in mysterious ways."</TE>
<TE>   Among those Bach has charmed is Robin Phillips, an old-school
British stage director known for guiding the likes of Laurence
Olivier, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith through turns in the
classics. It was his job, as shepherd of "Jekyll &amp; Hyde," to deliver
a novice actor from Skid Row to Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips lauds Bach's eagerness to learn, his work ethic and his
constant gratitude and good humor -- then pauses. "I sound as if I'm
going overboard. Let me assure you, this is not a usual habit. In a
very long career, working with him has certainly been a highlight."</TE>
<TE>   Bach still has some of the bad-boy rocker in him -- after his
tussle with a barkeep in March at a tavern near his home in
Middletown, N.J., he faced misdemeanor charges of assault, disorderly
conduct and making threats. They were dropped in July when the
accuser didn't turn up to testify. But this Jesus -- who says he
neither started the fight nor turned the other cheek once it was on
-- is nevertheless on probation, thanks to the small amount of
cannabis police found on him after the altercation.</TE>
<TE>   Overdoing the substances, Bach says, had a lot to do with the more
sordid episodes from his youth-gone-wild days. Now he has an adult
sorrow to drown: His father, painter David Bierk, died of cancer two
months ago at 58.</TE>
<TE>   "I can either throw myself into a bottle or sing the part of
Jesus," says Bach, who has been with his wife, Maria, for 17 years
and has sons named Paris and London. "I want to get my emotions out
through my art."</TE>
<TE>   Critics from the New York dailies didn't review him in "Jekyll"
and "Rocky Horror" because he joined both shows long after they had
opened. This time, pens and pads will be poised in every city.</TE>
<TE>   Tom McCoy, the "Superstar" tour's executive producer, thinks good
grades for performance and comportment will secure Bach's stage
career.</TE>
<TE>   Bach says he will always be a rocker. But the preparation and
focus needed to excel in a touring musical are what he craves right
now.</TE>
<TE>   "After being the lead singer of a heavy-metal band for 15 years, I
could use some discipline," he says. "How many years can you spend
doing whatever you want? I have a personality where I get addicted to
things, and now I'm addicted to this play."</TE>

<KH>CLASSICAL MUSIC</KH>
<HD>Ensemble of the past looks to future</HD>
<DH>The early-music group Musica Angelica invites imported
talent to help with its ambitious plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to early-music orchestras, Los Angeles is on the map,
but barely.</LD>
<LD>   Consider Boston's Handel &amp; Haydn Society. It's the oldest
continuously active performing-arts organization in the nation. It's
responsible for premiering Handel's "Messiah" in the United States
(in 1818, nearly 80 years after it was written). It plays at Boston's
Symphony Hall, among other venues, puts on more than 20 performances
in a seven-month season and claims an attendance larger than 30,000 a
year.</LD>
<LD>   On the West Coast, there's a thriving scene in Portland and
Seattle, but it's San Francisco that has the lock on early-music
superlatives. Its Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, though only 20
years old, stands at the top of the U.S.' "historically informed
performance" ensembles in budget ($2.8 million), number of concerts
(32 in the Bay Area, plus national and international tours) and
recordings (30).</LD>
<TE>   And in L.A.? The city has its share of programming, mini-festivals
and practitioners in the HIP realm, but the numbers of concerts, the
budgets of the ensembles and their audiences can't compare. The
biggest names tend to be those imported for music series around town.</TE>
<TE>   One local ensemble sees this situation as an emphatic invitation
to grow. Musica Angelica has successfully presented 10 subscription
seasons of Baroque and Renaissance music, with as many as 11
performances in five months, and it has had some high-profile guest
gigs -- playing for the Los Angeles Opera production of Handel's
"Julius Caesar" last season, for example, and for Long Beach Opera as
well. But next weekend it launches its biggest season, adding a
four-program, seven-performance orchestra series to its usual
smaller-force chamber series and collaborations with other
organizations. That means sustaining a bigger band, at bigger venues
-- and it will be fueled by some big names.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope with this new initiative to increase our audience and
subscribership," said Musica Angelica's director Michael Eagan, a
lute player who co-founded the group in 1993. (Cellist Mark
Chatfield, its other founder, died in 1998.)</TE>
<TE>   The spotlight in the new series will be on two imported stars, one
conductor and one conductor-player. Giovanni Antonini, who garnered a
Grammy Award two years ago for collaborating on Cecilia Bartoli's
"The Vivaldi Album," will conduct and play (flute and recorder) this
weekend and next in programs featuring Vivaldi and Bach.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring, Harry Bicket, the British conductor who triumphed
with the group in L.A. Opera's "Julius Caesar," will lead a
much-expanded ensemble in Bach's Mass in B minor and in a Handel and
Rameau program.</TE>
<TE>   "Antonini really represents the cutting edge of the period
instrument movement," Eagan said. "He and his group, Il Giardino
Armonico, are spectacular musicians. There's nothing stale or bookish
about their music making; it is virtuosic, sauve and fresh, all at
the same time."</TE>
<TE>   The Milanese musician said he hasn't heard Musica Angelica live,
although he knows the work of the two other soloists on the first of
his two programs: violinist Elizabeth Blumenstock, who frequently
plays with the ensemble, and oboist Gonzalo Ruiz, both from the Bay
Area.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a CD of the group and found it was a very good record,"
Antonini said from Milan. "It's quite rare that I conduct and play as
a soloist for a Baroque group other than Il Giardino. For me, it's
something of an experiment. We have to see how it's for them, too."</TE>
<TE>   Antonini will play Vivaldi's Recorder Concerto in C on the opening
concerts. Blumenstock will play the Bach Concerto in A minor, and
Ruiz will tackle Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 2, but using an oboe
instead of the usual flute as the solo instrument. ("What has come
down to us is not necessarily the original version," Eagan said.
"This will be Ruiz's reconstruction of what he feels was the
original.")</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 16 and 17, Antonini will play recorder and flute in works
by Vivaldi, Telemann and little-known Veronese composer Evaristo
dall'Abaco.</TE>
<TE>   "In a small group, it's important to have a common idea of
articulation, to speak the same language," Antonini said. "This is
the function of a conductor.... After this, there is space for
individual expression."</TE>
<TE>   As for future visits, Antonini said, "Nothing is excluded."</TE>
<TE>   Eagan is also high on Bicket's return to conduct what Eagan calls
"the high point of the season," Bach's B-minor Mass: "He has the most
experience conducting large orchestral Baroque works, and he was able
to elicit extraordinary music-making from the players."</TE>
<TE>   Eagan's expansion plans have some parallel in the history of the
Bay Area's Philharmonia Baroque, which is led by Briton Nicholas
McGegan, who also heads period ensembles or programs in Ireland; St.
Paul, Minn.; and Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "The growth [pattern] of Musica Angelica is not dissimilar to what
we've experienced," Philharmonia executive director Robert Berman
said. "We've been in business for 22 years. It took us several years
before we had a conductor. We started in 1981. Nicholas McGegan came
in around 1984. Our growth has been very steady.</TE>
<TE>   "The key has been the board's decision to really invest in the
artistic quality of the organization. The board committed to paying
the best rates [to musicians] in the country. That has caused this
group to have the growth that it's had. It's grown from $60,000 to a
$2.8-million budget in 20 years. What we have found is that it's the
quality of the music that ultimately matters, how good is your
performance standard."</TE>
<TE>   Eagan said his budget for the year, enhanced by a "substantial
grant" from the Colburn Foundation, will almost double, going
slightly over $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   "That will pay for the guest conductors," Eagan said, "the more
expensive venues, more marketing efforts and of course we will pay
the musicians more."</TE>
<TE>   Like Philharmonia -- and, in fact, all the period instrument
ensembles in the U.S. and Canada -- Musica Angelica imports some of
its musicians, anywhere from 10% to 30%, depending on repertory. The
field is a small one and the best players circulate among the various
groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the best players spend a lot of time on the road," Eagan
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to make Musica Angelica a resident orchestra. We
would like young players to be trained here and to move here. That's
easier said than done.</TE>
<TE>   "But it has not been easy. We do in fact have enormously gifted
musicians here, and more and more we're succeeding in interesting
them in period instrument performing," Eagan said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fortunate to be able to expand at a time of general
contraction in the arts. We are actively seeking more support so we
will be assured that this will continue for many years."</TE>

<HD>A new bloom from GNR veterans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Thorns? No Roses?</LD>
<LD>   What would you call a new band featuring Guns N' Roses founders
Slash, Duff McKagan and Izzy Stradlin along with longtime drummer
Matt Sorum?</LD>
<LD>   That's a question the four are pondering as they rehearse
together, writing new material and auditioning potential singers.</LD>
<TE>   GNR singer Axl Rose kept the Guns N' Roses name for the new lineup
he's assembled. Though starting a North American concert tour on
Thursday, his new GNR remains in limbo, with its "Chinese Democracy"
album chronically unfinished.</TE>
<TE>   The four ex-Gunners, though, are raring to go. They rehearsed a
few months ago with former Buckcherry singer Joshua Todd but now seem
set to tab Neurotica's Kelly Shaefer as their frontman. John Kalod-
ner, a veteran music executive who was key in Aerosmith's '80s and
'90s resurrection and has worked with many other classic hard-rock
acts, has been advising the ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Plans are for an album of new material and a tour, presumably
featuring some of the same GNR songs that Rose and crew are doing in
their shows.</TE>
<TE>   The rift recalls David Lee Roth's exit from Van Halen in the late
'80s. At the time, most pundits predicted that Roth would fare
better, given his charisma, a prediction that proved dramatically
incorrect.</TE>
<TE>   But the circumstances are so different here that predictions are
hard to make.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference with Van Halen was that there was more continuity
between the time Roth left the band and they brought in Sammy Hagar,"
says Geoff Mayfield, director of charts for Billboard magazine. "This
is almost a decade we're talking about since the last Guns N' Roses
album."</TE>
<TE>   Mayfield notes that for all its legendary stature, GNR has not
been among the top acts in continued sales impact. Only the 1987
debut, "Appetite for Destruction," has been even close to a regular
presence on Billboard's catalog chart, and neither of the twin 1991
"Use Your Illusion" albums, huge sellers at the time, has even
appeared on the catalog chart.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Slash, McKagan and Stradlin all have pursued solo
projects with little commercial success.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll have a leg up on other new bands in terms of getting
publicity right off the bat," Mayfield says. "But after that, as
always, it depends on the music they release."</TE>
<TE>   A little something for the faithful</TE>
<TE>   Advance copies of a live Bob Dylan album drawn from shows on his
freewheeling 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue tour have what appears to be
a Freudian slip in the packaging. The song "Simple Twist of Fate" is
listed as "Simple Twist of Faith" -- an amusing mistake, given that
shortly after that tour the Jewish artist made his own personal twist
of faith with his conversion to Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   But a source close to the project revealed that the spelling was
done deliberately, a little bit of fun for hard-core fans. The source
said that when the album is released Nov. 26, the title will be
correct.</TE>
<TE>   Small faces</TE>
<TE>   The Red Hot Chili Peppers' first four albums, from before the L.A.
band's big breakthrough hits, will be reissued in January in special
editions with previously unreleased bonus tracks. All four -- 1984's
"Red Hot Chili Peppers," 1985's "Freaky Styley," 1987's "The Uplift
Mofo Party Plan" and 1989's "Mother's Milk" -- will feature new
artwork, plus liner notes by bassist Flea. Among the more intriguing
bonus titles: a demo recording of "Salute to Kareem," a previously
unreleased song honoring Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar by a group
of devoted Lakers fans.</TE>
<TE>   After a first volume featuring music by Aimee Mann, Bruce
Springsteen and Suzanne Vega, among others, "Songs Inspired by
Literature: Chapter 2" will include David Bowie's "1984" (inspired by
George Orwell's classic) and Tom Waits' "A Good Man Is Hard to Find"
(after the Flannery O'Connor story), plus contributions by Roseanne
Cash and "The Tonight Show" band member Vicki Randall. The album, due
in the spring, will, like its predecessor, benefit adult literacy
programs and be released by Mann's United Musicians.</TE>
<TE>   After having engineered the Beatles' "Revolver," "Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band" and "Abbey Road" and having engineered and
produced dozens of albums by Paul McCartney, Elvis Costello, the
Zombies and many others, Geoff Emerick is doing his first-ever
production of an independent act. He's in L.A. working at Capitol
Records studios with Pasadena-based band the Syrups on a debut album
to be released by tiny Hollywood label Beck Records. Emerick was
introduced to the band by its manager, David Carr, a British-born
musician who has known the producer since they worked on an album
together in 1973.</TE>

<LD>Justin Timberlake</LD>
<LD>   "Justified" (Jive)</LD>
<LD>   **</LD>
<TE>   Teenage girls aren't the only ones enamored with 'N Sync's most
popular member. In a 2000 Calendar survey asking record executives to
name the most valuable pop properties, several cited Timberlake. One
even said that he could be the next Michael Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Timberlake hopes they are right. In much of his debut solo album,
you get the feeling that he's been dreaming for years about being the
new Michael. But he's still dreaming if he thinks he has pulled it
off -- even though he has talked Janet Jackson into singing with him
on one song.</TE>
<TE>   "Like I Love You," the first single from the album, comes closest
to "Off the Wall"/"Thriller"-era Michael. Timberlake's voice has that
familiar breathless, almost whispered quality and sensual tension,
and the well-crafted track is nicely updated with some edgy rap
touches by Clipse.</TE>
<TE>   Working with such savvy producers as Timbaland and the Neptunes,
Timberlake certainly moves dramatically past his 'N Sync goo,
although there is still something faceless about his tales of longing
for or celebrating intimate encounters.</TE>
<TE>   Timberlake can talk about being able to finally make the music in
his heart, but it sounds like nothing more than the music he and his
producers thought could get him onto the charts. And before anyone
says we need to cut the youngster some slack because he's just 21,
remember that Michael was 21 when he made "Off the Wall."</TE>
<TE>   -- Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   Cash's currency: adventurism that packs a punch</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Cash</TE>
<TE>   "American IV: The Man Comes Around" (American/Lost Highway)</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Cash's first three albums with producer Rick Rubin won Grammys,
and this one should keep the streak alive. Supplementing his own
material with songs from such varied sources as Nine Inch Nails and
Hank Williams, it's an eclectic collection whose highlights convey
the adventurism and heart that have characterized this country music
great's best recordings for half a century.</TE>
<TE>   At 70, Cash's voice is shaky in places, and some of the material
seems overly familiar, especially "Bridge Over Troubled Water" and
"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face." But the key moments are
exquisite expressions of human struggle and need that Cash sings with
a haunting conviction and depth of feeling. His version of "Give My
Love to Rose" captures the song's heartbreak sentiments with far more
urgency and darkness than his original '50s recording of the song.</TE>
<TE>   The key tracks carry the authority and punch of the classic live
prison albums that Cash recorded in the late '60s. "The Man Comes
Around" is a judgment-day tale as stark as anything else Cash has
written, while "Sam Hall" is every bit as wildly humorous a slice of
human orneriness as "A Boy Named Sue."</TE>
<TE>   A master still at work.</TE>
<TE>   -- R.H.</TE>
<TE>   Words never fail deft lyricist Gray</TE>
<TE>   David Gray</TE>
<TE>   "A New Day at Midnight" (ATO)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Proof that Ireland is still the spiritual home of Anglo-Saxon
poetry, Gray's 1998 album, "White Ladder," which went double-platinum
in the U.S., is now the bestselling noncompilation album of all time
there, over U2 and Van Morrison, even Enya.</TE>
<TE>   It's words, not the often same-sounding music, that hang in the
air during a Gray song, and on his follow-up album he turns his
astounding lyrical talent to darker corners with fresh and
devastating effect. On the opening track, "Dead in the Water," Gray
cracks the anxieties of being in and out of love in a manner both
world-weary and surprising.</TE>
<TE>   Delivered in his Mick Hucknall quaver and with a strange touch of
Dylan or John Prine timing, lines such as those to "Kangaroo" seem to
leap fully formed from the edges of the collective unconscious: "Will
you won't you be my leech / Take it all and when I screech / Leave it
there just out of reach / Take me to that burning bush / Give me
something I can't crush / Lead me out into the hush."</TE>
<TE>   The death of his father has Gray ruminating on mortality on the
soft piano tune "The Other Side," but even this is borne up by the
lightness of originality. Gray's "Midnight" is an honest and
illuminated place, fearful where it should be but still fully
believing in morning.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dean Kuipers</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, he isn't a Boy wonder</TE>
<TE>   Badly Drawn Boy</TE>
<TE>   "Have You Fed the Fish?" (artistDirect/XL)</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   What if you're a singer-songwriter with a gift for sweet, wistful
pop songs but want to spread your creative wings? Or maybe you're
just tired of having your music mistaken on the radio for the
delicate sounds of Elliott Smith or the early Paul Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever, Damon Gough (a.k.a. Badly Drawn Boy) moves here from the
gentle observation and wisdom of his first two memorable albums --
2000's "The Hour of Bewilderbeast" and last spring's "About a Boy"
soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   In "Fish," he and co-producer Tom Rothrock add some instrumental
muscle, including horns and aggressive percussion, much of which
battles for your attention in ways that don't always serve the
music's often wistful themes. The bigger problem is that Gough the
songwriter has also expanded his world in ways that aren't always
helpful.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than focus on the universal feelings of someone searching
for his soul mate, Gough is now puzzling at times over the challenge
of maintaining his emotional balance (and relationship) amid the
increased demands of his escalating success. When he asks a familiar
songwriter's question, "How can I give you the answers you need, when
all I possess is a melody," you may be tempted to reply, "Not my
problem, pal."</TE>
<TE>   -- R.H.</TE>
<TE>   In brief</TE>
<TE>   The Wallflowers</TE>
<TE>   "Red Letter Days" (Interscope)</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   Can't blame Wallflowers main man Jakob Dylan for making changes --
the band's last album, 2000's "Breach," had his most personal and
direct songs, but failed to connect with fans. And the subsequent
exit of lead guitarist Michael Ward left holes to fill. But the new
electronic touches and amped-up production make even lyrics about
fresh starts and new frontiers sound more like a retreat.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   Roni Size</TE>
<TE>   "Touching Down" (Full Cycle)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   In "Touching Down," the Bristol-based Size sheds the annoying
upright bass of his jazzy past in favor of an angry, relentless,
tech-flavored mix CD of his solo work, reaffirming the buoyancy of
drum-and-bass. The style has cycled from the British underground to
TV commercials and back, and Size makes a major statement about where
it's at today: down in the ghetto.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dennis Romero</TE>
<TE>   Volovan</TE>
<TE>   "Volovan" (Lakeshore)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Other Mexican bands have already transposed British dream pop into
the Latin rock vernacular. This tuneful Monterrey quartet makes a
difference by borrowing the poetic, ethereal vibe of groups like Blur
and Pulp and incorporating it into a lo-fi, shimmering guitar
pastiche on this disc (already released) that's delightfully
idiosyncratic.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Vance Packard's "The Hidden Persuaders" shot to the top of the
bestseller lists in 1957 with its documentation of how Madison Avenue
influenced our purchasing decisions by subliminal means -- "beneath
our level of awareness," as Packard put it.</LD>
<LD>   Commercial persuaders are far more pervasive today than they were
in Packard's day, but they're not all hidden now. Many are obtrusive
and intrusive -- in your face, every day.</LD>
<LD>   Various key moments in sports events, for example, are no longer
simply reported, they're "brought to you by" some commercial outfit
("The AT&amp;T Wireless Starting Lineup," "Our Nissan game summary").</LD>
<TE>   Granted, sports is a form of entertainment. We have not yet gotten
to the point where Dan Rather says, "This report on the latest
terrorist bombing in Israel is brought to you by Kleenex." But given
what Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media studies at New York
University, calls "the increasing acceleration, the omnipresence, the
increasingly brazen nature of commercial messages," we seem to have
reached the point where something very much like that is no longer
unthinkable.</TE>
<TE>   What worries me the most about this is that it further erodes
public trust in the media.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Miller attributes the "corrosive, mass cynicism that is
now a feature of American society" to the increased commercialization
of our culture.</TE>
<TE>   "This ad-saturated environment tends to foster a culture of
smirking disbelief, a ... knee-jerk skepticism that makes people
untrusting of anything they hear from anybody," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone knows that advertising is the art of exaggeration,
manipulation and -- often -- outright deception. Or, as Miller puts
it, "advertising is a form of propaganda." If people come to feel
that virtually everything they see is an attempt to manipulate them,
that society has become just one big infomercial, they'll come to be
even more skeptical than they already are about what they see in the
legitimate media.</TE>
<TE>   My other concern is the effect all this has on children. They,
too, become more cynical, more materialistic -- and less
discriminating -- under this incessant commercial barrage. When
13-year-olds like my son buy tennis shoes or a stocking cap, it's the
name brand that matters; price, convenience, even quality seem
irrelevant to them.</TE>
<TE>   Madison Avenue , never slow to pick up on cultural trends, knows
how to exploit that. So more and more ads are directed at kids. This
gotta-buy, gotta-have barrage is directly connected to the lack of
idealism we see in so many young people today -- their sense that
education is only important as a means to a better-paying job.</TE>
<TE>   Not-so-quiet desperation</TE>
<TE>   I'm not naive. I realize that, in the immortal words of our 30th
president, Calvin Coolidge, "The business of America is business." I
also realize that we are the only nation on the planet to have
elected as its national leader a former advertising huckster, our
40th president, Ronald ("At General Electric, progress is our most
important product") Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   But we've now gone far beyond anything even Silent Cal and the
Great Communicator might have envisioned. As audiences for prime-time
network television shows continue to shrink, advertisers are growing
increasingly desperate. That's why we are now besieged by more
advertising, in more venues, than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   At my neighborhood ATM, I was subjected to a video commercial
urging me to watch Connie Chung on CNN.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of weeks ago, Nike pasted 3-foot-square advertising
decals on sidewalks in Manhattan -- "a creative way to connect with
our consumers," Nike called it, until city officials called it
something else: illegal defacing of the sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   When "La Boheme" opens at the Broadway Theatre in New York on Dec.
8, the audience will see, on a rooftop in the set's Paris skyline, a
gleaming sign for Montblanc -- the Swiss-made pen, not the French
mountain. On the right side of the stage, on a tenement building,
will be a large ad for Piper-Heidsieck Champagne.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the advertising is not just annoying; it distorts
reality. Did you happen to notice all those commercial billboards in
the center of your picture during the World Series? Did you see any
of them when you went to a game, in person? No, you didn't. Those
signs, which appeared to be painted on the stands behind home plate
at Edison Field -- to take one example -- were virtual ads, digitally
inserted in the picture.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, product placement in movies has been growing by Jeeps
and Mounds ever since E.T. began nibbling Reese's Pieces 20 years
ago. The products are almost co-stars themselves now -- Ray-Ban
sunglasses in "Men in Black"; Nokia, Lexus and the Gap in "Minority
Report"; a Wilson volleyball in "Cast Away" -- and television is in
the process of taking product placement to new levels of
exploitation.</TE>
<TE>   "Survivor," "Sex and the City," "Push, Nevada" and "American Idol"
are but a few of the shows in which the traditional wall between
entertainment content and commercial messages has been breached. As
the Washington Post noted about "American Idol," "it was nearly
impossible to judge where the show ended and the ads for corporate
sponsors Ford and Coca-Cola began. Coke cups were in every shot
involving the judges during auditions for the show; during the show
itself, contestants were shown riding in a Ford Focus and the Coke
logo was omnipresent."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it shouldn't be surprising that so-called reality shows
are the leaders in product placement.</TE>
<TE>   The commercialization of America -- and the cynicism and
materialism it fosters -- may be the ultimate reality in our culture
today.</TE>

<HD>A director who sees the beauty of thinking small</HD>
<DH>Matt Almos and his Burglars of Hamm are hitting it big with
comedy on the fringe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matt Almos is a Moliere fan. The L.A. director's favorite play is
"The Misanthrope," which he staged at California Institute of the
Arts as a graduate student. It's his pick "because it's funny, not
because it's supposed to be funny, like so many classics," Almos
said.</LD>
<LD>   No one, least of all Almos, has yet enthroned Almos as the Moliere
of L.A.'s small theaters. Yet when he discusses Moliere's aims, and
then his own, they sound remarkably similar.</LD>
<LD>   Moliere "is not trying to change the world. He's throwing
satirical darts, and they hit their mark." Ditto the goal of the
Burglars of Hamm, the company of which Almos is resident director, as
well as sometime writer and actor.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of theater companies in L.A. try to provide sumptuous
meals," he said. "We serve snacks. I don't think it has less value.
There are targeted places on the palate that a snack can get to and a
meal can't. Thinking smaller sometimes allows you to break ground
that can't be broken by a larger, more ambitious endeavor."</TE>
<TE>   And so the Burglars have become stars of L.A. fringe theater's
comedy wing, especially with "Resa Fantastiskt Mystisk." It's a witty
parody of a production of a faux-Strindbergian play, in which the
domineering director analyzes the proceedings with a live commentary
on audience headsets and barges on stage to try to fix the
floundering performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Resa," created and developed by the Burglars in collaboration
with the Ghost Road Company in 1999, has gone on to fringe festivals
in Seattle, Edinburgh and New York.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for "Resa" arose when Almos' mother complained that she
wished the group's sketches could come with written notes to explain
their intent. Almos replied, "in a pompous tone, that next time she
could wear headphones and I would tell her what it meant." As soon as
the words were out of his mouth, he exchanged glances with his wife,
and they knew they had the idea for their next show.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, audiences at the L.A. Edge of the World Theater
Festival howled over the Burglars' "Easy Targets," in which each
Burglar performed a different kind of cliched solo act while being
pelted with rolled-up socks that the company rented to the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Almos, 34, does not live on snacks alone. He's directing the
premiere of Robert Fieldsteel's "Crazy Drunk." It focuses on the 1903
slaying involving Griffith J. Griffith. The L.A. benefactor best
known for giving the city Griffith Park shot his wife in a Santa
Monica hotel. Though it has "fantasy sequences that push it into
farcical terrain," Almos said, "for the most part it's dramatic. It's
a sumptuous meal."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited to work on a play that can give L.A. audiences a
sense that we're part of a larger, bizarre, twisted story. In East
Coast cities, you're surrounded by a sense of history. Here you seem
to be surrounded by Taco Bell. But the truth is that L.A.'s history
is deep and interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Born in La Verne, raised in Encinitas (where he played Bill Sykes
in "Oliver!" in the eighth grade), an undergraduate at UC Riverside
(where he staged "Seascape") and a grad student at CalArts, Almos has
seldom strayed far from L.A.</TE>
<TE>   After grad school, he got a close look at the L.A. underbelly by
transcribing police interrogations for the district attorney's
office, where he learned that "the good cop-bad cop cliche is totally
true." He also was an assistant to attorneys for a property
management firm.</TE>
<TE>   He finally was freed from non-theater day jobs by A.S.K. Theater
Projects, where he worked as a dramaturge from 1996 until earlier
this year, when he resigned amid a shakeup. He encountered "Crazy
Drunk" at A.S.K. The organization is one of the sponsors of the Hot
Properties series at [Inside] the Ford, where "Crazy Drunk,"
featuring the Buffalo Nights Theatre Company, opens Nov. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Mead Hunter, former director of literary programs at A.S.K. and
Almos' former supervisor, said, "Matt's deadpan sense of humor can be
disquieting. It's hard to know when he's pulling your leg. All the
Burglars love scavenging from the scrap pile of pop-speak. Matt
especially has enriched my vocabulary with such terms as
'heavyosity,' 'groovasaurus' and 'funkalicious.' "</TE>
<TE>   Almos and former CalArts buddies -- including his wife, Carolyn --
created the Burglars of Hamm in 1996 from the remnants of Someone
Stole Our Name, a sketch comedy group. The new name was inspired by
the Hamburglar of McDonald's commercials, not by the character of
Hamm in Beckett's "Endgame" or anything that respectable. "We all get
a twinge of embarrassment when we say the name," Almos said.</TE>
<TE>   The Burglars are considering doing three shows in repertory early
next year: "Resa"; either "Easy Targets" or their 2000 show "Hot
City" -- a lampoon of TV drama series -- plus the developing "The
Party Show," a satire of the club scene.</TE>
<TE>   They try "to bridge the gap between sketch comedy and theater,"
Almos said. He laughs a lot at the sketch masters the Groundlings, he
said, and "that's part of why I don't want to do what they do. They
do it so well. Instead, we're a little looser in setting up the
jokes. We commit to the vocabulary of what we're spoofing and let the
comedy fall where it may."</TE>

<LD>The holiday season usually signals at least one big-event animated
film. This year, however, promises enough live-action family tent
poles to hold up a city, which will leave two top-pedigree,
traditionally animated adventures striving to keep up with the
Potters and the Bagginses.</LD>
<LD>   On Nov. 27 Disney blasts off for "Treasure Planet," a futuristic
take on "Treasure Island" from writer-directors John Musker and Ron
Clements ("The Little Mermaid," "Aladdin" and "Hercules") that has
been in production for five years, and on the back burner since the
mid-1980s.</LD>
<LD>   Apart from the high-tech trappings, it is a fairly faithful
adaptation of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic right down to the
18th century costumes and wooden galleons for spaceships. "It's
visually anachronistic because we wanted to keep the romance," says
Clements. "Science fiction can be kind of cold and distancing, and we
wanted this to be warm and inviting." Initially, the film (which will
be released simultaneously in standard and Imax formats) was
scheduled as a summer release, though Musker is happier with its
current placement: "I think there's something about the holidays and
classic English literature that go together."</LD>
<TE>   On Dec. 20, Paramount will open "The Wild Thornberrys Movie,"
based on the Nickelodeon series about a family of roving wildlife
experts. Producer Gabor Csupo believes the film will break through
the small-to-big-screen box-office lethargy that plagued this year's
"Hey Arnold: The Movie" and "The Powerpuff Girls."</TE>
<TE>   "For one thing it has a lot bigger scope as far as the movie and
the adventure" -- it was filmed in wide-screen Panavision -- "and
it's a lot more relatable to adults." Csupo frets that the film,
which centers on a hunt for animal poachers in the African savanna,
"might have a little hard time in the opening weekend," but he hopes
word-of-mouth makes up for it in subsequent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the competition could get Harry.</TE>

<TE>   Die Another Day</TE>
<TE>   Action (Nov. 22)</TE>
<TE>   MGM</TE>
<TE>   With: Pierce Brosnan, Halle Berry, Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike,
Rick Yune, John Cleese, Judi Dench.</TE>
<TE>   The idea: Bond racks up the miles in pursuit of a villainous duo.</TE>
<TE>   Writers: Neal Purvis and Robert Wade; based on characters in the
novels by Ian Fleming and previous James Bond films.</TE>
<TE>   Director: Lee Tamahori.</TE>
<TE>   James Bond has been going strong for 40 years, ever since Connery,
Sean Connery, first applied his license to kill in "Dr. No." But does
this billion-dollar franchise still have what it takes to compete
with Xander Cage in the new millennium? We'll soon find out. There's
more fueling early buzz on Bond 20 than Berry's turn as Jinx, a most
contemporary Bond Grrrl. Word has it that New Zealand director
Tamahori ("Once Were Warriors") maintained a furious pace during the
early days of filming that even rankled Brosnan, but don't
underestimate the 49-year-old Irish actor's stamina -- or chops. He
taps into a darker side in his fourth outing as 007, turning renegade
to thwart the icy Stephens and avert a global crisis in Korea.</TE>

<TE>   Maid in Manhattan</TE>
<TE>   Romantic comedy (Dec. 13)</TE>
<TE>   Columbia/Revolution</TE>
<TE>   With: Jennifer Lopez, Ralph Fiennes, Natasha Richardson, Stanley
Tucci, Tyler Garcia Posey, Bob Hoskins.</TE>
<TE>   The idea: Mistaken identity unites a Bronx-born hotel maid and a
political scion.</TE>
<TE>   Writer: Kevin Wade, story by Edmond Dantes.</TE>
<TE>   Director: Wayne Wang.</TE>
<TE>   Wade, who wrote "Working Girl," another tale of a borough babe who
finds love on the island, says he is "drawn to stories about class
distinctions and class movement in what is supposedly a classless
society." Wade, who lives in Oyster Bay, N.Y., with his wife and two
children, did most of his research in tony Big Apple hotels. His goal
was to take the Hollywood stereotype image of the maid and turn it
into a Horatio Alger story. Lopez's character may fall in love with
Fiennes' wealthy political heir, but "it was very important that she
not set her sights on a guy and say there's my ticket out. What she
most wanted is to get a better job. She is smart and she works hard
and thinks she can contribute to the next level."</TE>

<TE>   Solaris</TE>
<TE>   Science fiction (Nov. 27)</TE>
<TE>   Fox</TE>
<TE>   With: George Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Jeremy Davies, Viola
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The idea: Psychologist investigates strange behavior on a space
station orbiting a distant planet (remake of 1972 Russian film).</TE>
<TE>   Writer-director: Steven Soderbergh, based on the book by Stanislaw
Lem.</TE>
<TE>   The prickly, eccentric Lem once had his honorary membership in the
Science Fiction Writers of America revoked. That attitude may prove
an asset for producer James Cameron and writer-director Soderbergh as
they tackle Lem's 1961 novel "Solaris." (See Nov. 22 entry.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gangs of New York</TE>
<TE>   Historical drama (Dec. 20)</TE>
<TE>   Miramax</TE>
<TE>   With: Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz, John C.
Reilly, Henry Thomas, Jim Broadbent.</TE>
<TE>   The idea: Irish immigrant leaves prison, seeks revenge on
murderous gang lord in 1860s Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Writers: Jay Cocks and Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan; story
by Jay Cocks.</TE>
<TE>   Director: Martin Scorsese.</TE>
<TE>   Of his three months in Italy handling screenwriting duties,
Lonergan says, "I remember being quite frightened and then just
delighted." Wandering the gigantic set overseen by Dante Ferretti, "I
can't convey what it was like. To turn a corner and be in a harbor
with huge ships and hundreds of extras made it come alive in such an
exciting way. It's not like it's in front of you, it's all around
you. It was a real work of art -- a physical, life-size
reconstruction of an entire neighborhood in a vanished era. To be a
part of that much creative power ... was just inspiring."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two Weeks Notice</TE>
<TE>   Romantic comedy (Dec. 20)</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros./Castle Rock</TE>
<TE>   With: Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, Alicia Witt, Mark Feuerstein,
Dana Ivey, Robert Klein, Heather Burns, David Haig.</TE>
<TE>   The idea: Millionaire mistreats his attorney-assistant, misses her
when she leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Writer-director: Marc Lawrence.</TE>
<TE>   Combine Grant and Bullock, stir for an aperitif that should
contrast nicely with the mostly heavier surrounding fare. It's a
little surprising they haven't been teamed before, because they have
clicked in romantic comedies when other material has proved less
appetizing. One of a handful of women who can carry a studio picture,
Bullock also produced this one, her third with writer Lawrence, in
his directing debut.</TE>

<LD>Homing in on honoree Halle Berry, comedian Brad Garrett kept the
wisecracks coming: "I thought 'Monster's Ball' was the sequel to
'Monsters, Inc.,' " he joked, as he stood before the Academy
Award-winning actress and hundreds of guests at a benefit for the Los
Angeles Chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation. "See Halle's and my
picture in the program? My wife just told me that's as close as I'll
ever get to Halle Berry."</LD>
<LD>   The Emmy Award-winning co-star of "Everybody Loves Raymond" emceed
the Oct. 26 event, which featured a gourmet dinner and the chance to
watch Berry receive the Celebrity Wish Granter Award. "I received the
award last year -- talk about trading up," Garrett deadpanned.</LD>
<LD>   The actress, dressed in a strapless Armani, came from Vancouver --
where she was shooting the "X-Men" sequel "X2" -- for the affair.
Held at the St. Regis Hotel &amp; Spa in Century City, it raised $200,000
to help grant the wishes of children with life-threatening illnesses.</LD>
<TE>   "I've never forgotten the joy of granting a wish," said Berry, who
two years ago helped make teenage aplastic anemia patient Kimberly
English's dream of magazine modeling come true. English said: "It
made me feel good that something wonderful came out of my being
sick."</TE>

<LD>It was former Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman's first Los Angeles
visit in 13 years, and most of the fickle locals who promised to
attend his party (Lara Flynn Boyle, Dweezil Zappa, Little Richard and
Dennis Hopper) didn't show. But it hardly seemed to matter. The Oct.
24 gathering at Bar Marmont was more like a reunion of old hippies
than a Hollywood fete. Wyman's three precocious little girls (ages 8,
6 and 4), dressed in scarves and fairy costumes, flitted among the
adults. More people congregated on the smoking patio than inside the
dimly lighted club. And denim, not silicone, was the dominant
fashion.</LD>
<LD>   They came to celebrate Wyman's 66th birthday and help launch his
fourth book, "Rolling With the Stones," a scrapbook chronicling
Wyman's decades with the band.</LD>
<LD>   Wyman, married to his fourth wife, Suzanne, seems as content as
ever to leave the stadium shows and backstage drama to his bandmates.
He says he grew "bored to death of flying" and now spends much of his
time writing and cherishing his family. (Wyman left the band in 1993.
Meanwhile, the Stones keep rolling. Tickets to the current tour are
fetching more than $1,000 from brokers.) "I haven't seen the show
yet, but I heard it is great," he said. "I am very happy for them."</LD>
<TE>   At the party, Monty Python vet Eric Idle nested in a corner
issuing witty quips about his friend: "I just came to see that he's
still alive." Electric Light Orchestra's Jeff Lynne moseyed in with a
female companion. Musician and producer Carla Olson reminisced about
meeting Wyman back in '83 when she appeared in a Bob Dylan music
video. "Without him and Charlie Watts, there wouldn't have been a
band," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriter Ian La Frenais, who bore a remarkable resemblance to
Wyman, his friend of more than 40 years, confessed he missed the wild
rock star days of their youth. But, La Frenais said, Wyman's
departure from the Stones "triggered probably the most creative years
of his life."</TE>

<LD>Question: This is a small common-interest development in Los Angeles
with fewer than 20 owners. We all know each other, but we do not all
get along.</LD>
<LD>   After being embarrassed at a meeting when the board announced that
I owed fines and late fees, I asked the board to remove these
charges, which I believe are erroneous. And I asked the board to tell
the management company to stop threatening me with liens and sending
my account to collection.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the board is now threatening to ruin my credit. Because I
paid my monthly dues by money order, the date clearly shows I was not
late.</LD>
<TE>   To my shock, a smiling board member told me he "deliberately"
withheld posting my monthly dues because he is "teaching me a lesson"
to force me to live by association rules.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the late fees nor the interest that is accumulating is
legitimate. The board has enlisted the help of others in the complex
to ridicule me by telling me to "pay up."</TE>
<TE>   This is causing me great anxiety. I feel like I've been framed and
don't know how to stop it. How can I have these bogus fees
eradicated?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: This "us-versus-them" type of badgering from boards and
management companies is often referred to as "frame and blame." The
homeowner may have done nothing wrong but the board makes it appear
as if he or she did. This game is costly for the homeowner, who could
ultimately lose the house over late or nonpayment issues.</TE>
<TE>   In this scenario, the board fails to deposit the association dues
payment until after the due date, then alleges the payment was late.
It is the owner's word against theirs.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the added precaution of mailing the payment by a method
requiring a signature upon receipt or other proof of delivery --
including a letter documenting the serial number of the money order
and describing what you intended the payment to apply to -- are no
guarantee that a board might not succeed with late-payment
accusations.</TE>
<TE>   In your case, there is a significant legal difference in that a
board member admitted the payment was withheld because you "deserve
it." This statement could work in your favor should you pursue a
lawsuit against the association or have to defend against one brought
by them.</TE>
<TE>   You need to document the board member's statements in a letter to
the board, dispute the charges and demand proof of the late-payment
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Should you be forced to file a lawsuit, the conduct of your board
could be used against it. A lawyer can give you more information
about whether statements made by the board member and the imposition
of erroneous late fees are actionable.</TE>
<TE>   "Frame and blame" tactics have gained momentum because there is no
law penalizing boards or management companies that use this ploy, nor
is there a law providing assistance to homeowners who bear the brunt
of the tactic. Homeowners are afforded the small consolation that an
association cannot foreclose for failure to pay "fines."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the only remedy available to homeowners is the
lawsuit.</TE>

<HD>Prices of condominiums are closing in on houses</HD>
<DH>The rise is driven by a frenzied market and a dwindling
supply of affordable housing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Condominiums, for decades the inexpensive alternative to houses, have
posted a dramatic increase in value around Southern California,
surpassing the appreciation of single-family homes in one county,
according to recent research.</LD>
<LD>   A decade-long, steep drop in condo and townhome construction,
along with soaring home prices, has created a surge of demand for
attached units, mirroring the recent home-buying frenzy.</LD>
<LD>   The median price for a condominium in Los Angeles County in
September was $220,000, up 20.5% over the same period a year ago, and
up 93% from the same month five years ago. In Orange County, the
median condo price was $262,000, up 14.9% over a year ago, and up
107.1% from five years ago, according to First American Real Estate
Solutions, a real estate research firm.</LD>
<TE>   The median price of a single-family residence in Los Angeles
County increased in September at a slower pace than condos, up 17.2%
over a year ago to $280,000.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, condominiums have been considered the stepchild of
the residential home-buying market, a purchase made because the units
were priced considerably lower than single-family residences.</TE>
<TE>   Recent data reveal, however, that the gap in the median price per
square foot between condos and single-family homes has narrowed
significantly. In Orange County, for example, the cost of a condo per
square foot was $220.22 in September, only 5.4% less than that of a
single-family home of equal size at $232.17 a square foot.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego County, the cost per square foot of a condominium in
September was actually more than that of a detached house of equal
square footage. The condo price was $226.80 per square foot, while
the single-family dwelling of equal size was 3.2% lower, or $219.47,
according to First American's research.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing a lot of 'now-or-never' condo buying right now,"
said Chris Cagan, director of research and analytics at First
American Real Estate Solutions. "Interest rates are down, and renters
want to become homeowners. Condos are the way to get in."</TE>
<TE>   Typically, condos are smaller in square footage than single-family
dwellings, and require less land -- the most expensive part of the
price of a home. Therefore, condos have cost far less than detached
homes. The number of multifamily units built in the last decade has
greatly diminished, however, pushing the demand and prices for
attached housing ever higher.</TE>
<TE>   Last decade's proliferation of construction-defect lawsuits,
stemming from a rash of hastily built condos in the '80s, among other
issues, forced much of the insurance industry to stop covering
attached-housing construction. That resulted in a huge decline in new
building of that type of housing.</TE>
<TE>   Condo construction peaked in Los Angeles and Ventura counties in
the third quarter of 1989, with 2,152 units, according to the Meyers
Group in Irvine, which does consulting work for new-home builders.
Only 333 condos went up in those counties during the second quarter
of this year, the latest period for which data are available. The low
point in condo construction was the fourth quarter of 1999, with only
112 units.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Bechel, 39, counts himself among the lucky ones able to find
a reasonably priced condo in the San Fernando Valley. The single
controller of a major hotel chain moved into his two-bedroom Valley
Village condo two weeks ago, after a fruitless, eight-month search
for a single-family home in his price range. He paid $219,000 for his
unit -- a steal, according to his agent -- making an offer on the
condo without ever stepping inside.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd made four or five offers on other condos that I didn't get,
even when I offered more than the asking price," he said. "So when I
heard about this one, I ran over there, peeked in a window, and made
my offer to the agent. I saw it for the first time at the
inspection."</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, condo owners -- typically, first-time buyers --
view that purchase as a stepping stone to eventual homeownership.</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, agents such as Jamie Duran in Studio City, are
seeing condo owners moving up to more expensive units, because prices
of larger, single-family homes still are too far out of reach.</TE>
<TE>   "Some condo owners who bought for $250,000 are moving up to
$350,000 units, perhaps in a better location," Duran said. "Homes in
Studio City start at $477,000 right now, so $350,000 feels like a
bargain."</TE>
<TE>   On the Westside, condos that cost $175,000 in 1996 fetch $400,000
today, said Steve Miller, an agent at Re/Max Westside Properties in
West Los Angeles. One reason for the surge in prices is the lack of
available condos there. In Culver City, for example, there were 222
condos for sale in the fall of 1992. Today there are 22.</TE>
<TE>   The demand for condos also has pushed prices up in Long Beach,
where some units in the Villa Riviera, a historic downtown building,
are going for $465,000, said Lee Shoag, an agent with Re/Max College
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting a possible resurgence of condo construction, developers
in Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach are tearing down
old buildings and putting up attached housing, a sight not seen for
years, said Steve Goddard, an agent at Re/Max Beach Cities Realty in
Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   In the beach cities, condos start at about $600,000 by the water,
and further inland, apartment conversions go for $200,000 to
$400,000, Goddard said.</TE>
<TE>   Projects such as Quail Hill and North Park in Irvine are adding
much-needed attached housing in Orange County, a trend that is
expected to continue, said John Burns, an Irvine consultant to
new-home builders. Builders are eager to resume condo construction,
and are cautiously stepping back into that arena, said Rich Lambros,
executive vice president of the Building Industry Assn. of Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   With the passage of recent state legislation overhauling
construction-defect laws, builders have changed a number of their
practices. They plan to build even more attached housing when
insurance companies resume covering condo construction in the state,
Lambros said.</TE>
<TE>   The urgency to increase the supply will intensify as baby boomers
begin to downsize, fueling a trend toward condominium and townhouse
living, said Nima Nattagh, research director at FNC Inc., a
consulting firm to the mortgage industry.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to see a move by builders toward higher-density
products," Nattagh said. "They want to capitalize on the limited
space available."</TE>

<HD>Agoura Hills: a quiet 'gateway' in the Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Bertolucci</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Agoura Hills offers families an escape from the clutter and chaos of
the nearby San Fernando Valley megalopolis. The upscale bedroom
community of 20,537 has top-ranked schools, easily accessible hiking
trails and scenic vistas of the Santa Monica Mountains. It was
incorporated 20 years ago and is about 40 miles northwest of downtown
Los Angeles, between the San Fernando and Conejo valleys.</LD>
<LD>   Drawing card</LD>
<LD>   This is a quiet, low-crime community where parents still allow
their children to walk to school. Hillside parks and hiking trails
ring the town, creating an ideal environment for backpack outings.
And Agoura Hill's proximity to the Ventura Freeway corridor makes it
convenient for commuting to nearby white-collar hubs.</LD>
<TE>   Wow factor</TE>
<TE>   The city bills itself as "the gateway to the Santa Monica National
Recreation Area" and for good reason: The northern arm of the rugged
preserve forms a half-circle around the town, creating permanent open
space and providing mountain views for most residents. The area was
called Picture City in the 1920s, when Paramount Studios shot movies
here.</TE>
<TE>   Insider's view</TE>
<TE>   Agoura Hills has a laid-back, family-friendly feel that's
increasingly rare in larger communities. Block parties aren't
uncommon, and neighbors often know each other's names. The beaches of
Malibu are a quick trip (15 to 20 minutes, traffic permitting) over
Kanan Road to the ocean, and nearby Westlake Village offers a variety
of upscale shops and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Good news, bad news</TE>
<TE>   Agoura Hills is freeway close to Los Angeles' major cultural
attractions. Some neighborhoods, however, are too close to the 101
Freeway, making it impossible to escape the 24/7 din of speeding
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Hot spots</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhoods built in the 1980s and '90s have the largest homes,
ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 square feet. Prices in the posh Morrison
Highlands neighborhood range from $850,000 to $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Mid-range subdivisions include Chateau Springs and Morrison East
Meadows, where homes from 2,400 to 3,400 square feet sell for
$490,000 to $660,000.</TE>
<TE>   Homes built in the '60s and '70s tend to be nondescript and
smaller, but are affordable for younger families. Houses in the Lake
Lindero and Hillrise neighborhoods are in demand, ranging from
$315,000 to $485,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Lake Lindero Country Club, with its community pool, tennis
courts and nine-hole golf course, is a popular gathering spot.</TE>
<TE>   Stock report</TE>
<TE>   Single-family homes make up more than 80% of the city's housing
stock. Condominiums and townhouses are scattered near the noisy 101
Freeway, but nearby Oak Park offers a better selection of multiunit
housing.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Agoura Hills' homes suffer from the tract-home blandness
that afflicts many modern subdivisions, and the area lacks an
eclectic charm present in many older communities.</TE>
<TE>   Report card</TE>
<TE>   Public schools in Agoura Hills are part of the highly rated Las
Virgenes Unified School District, which serves more than 12,000
students from Westlake Village to Calabasas. The district's
elementary, middle and high school test scores are well above state
and national averages.</TE>
<TE>   On the market</TE>
<TE>   At the end of October there were 130 properties listed for sale,
ranging from $172,500 to $2,395,000.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Sheldon Appel, a custom builder, built this home in Bel-Air for
himself in 1990, he had to take into account his collection of art.</LD>
<LD>   After completing the house, it took a helicopter to lift four
sculptures into his backyard. Now the walls of the house are a
showplace for original art.</LD>
<LD>   The house has 10-foot-high doors finished like mirrors, 14-foot
ceilings, slabs of seamless granite covering the floors and kitchen
cabinets of stainless steel. The entry hall is 30 by 30 feet, big
enough for a grand piano. And the walls of the study are Napa burl
wood stained mustard yellow.</LD>
<TE>   There is a granite motor court for 30 cars and 12-foot-high front
doors, made of pewter.</TE>
<TE>   About this house: This is one of a dozen houses that Appel built
in a guard-gated enclave within Bel-Air.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $5.9 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: 8,400 square feet</TE>
<TE>   Features: The home also has six bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms plus a
dining area, breakfast bar, family room, patio and office. The house
sits on almost one flat acre with city views.</TE>

<HD>He's leaving the 'Rush Hour' in the Valley behind</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Tucker, who co-stars with Jackie Chan in the popular "Rush
Hour" movies, has put his home in a gated San Fernando Valley
community on the market at just under $2.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   Tucker has lived in the home since 1996 and is thinking of
building a home in another gated development.</LD>
<LD>   The home Tucker is selling has five bedrooms and seven bathrooms
in slightly more than 6,300 square feet. The house also has a loft
office, a family room with a wet bar, a master suite with verandas, a
steam shower and two walk-in closets; a kitchen with a walk-in
pantry; three fireplaces, a gated courtyard; and garages for three
cars with direct access into the house.</LD>
<TE>   The home, which also has city and golf course views, sits on
nearly an acre with a pool and a spa. Tucker is the original owner of
the house, which was built in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The actor-comedian, 30, co-starred with Chan in two "Rush Hour"
comedy-action films and is due to start work in January 2004 on a
third. In June, Tucker earned an award at the 2002 MTV Movie Awards
for best fight, recognizing his battle in "Rush Hour 2" (2001).</TE>
<TE>   Tucker also has been acknowledged for his travels to Africa this
year to witness efforts to fight AIDS and to encourage economic
development.</TE>
<TE>   Michele Blackmon of Michele Blackmon Estates in Venice has the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   'King of Romance' finds right mood in Brentwood</TE>
<TE>   Engelbert Humperdinck, who sold his longtime Holmby Hills home in
September as part of a $30-million package including two adjacent
properties owned by a financier, has purchased a Mediterranean-style
house in Brentwood for about $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The house, built in 1992, has five bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms in
slightly more than 4,500 square feet. It is at the end of a gated,
private drive. There is a living room with high ceilings, an office,
a master suite with a fireplace, two terraces and a balcony.</TE>
<TE>   The singer, 66, had owned his seven-bedroom, 8,200-square-foot
Holmby Hills home, known as the Pink Palace, since the 1970s. Built
in 1935 for crooner Rudy Vallee, the home also was owned by actress
Jayne Mansfield.</TE>
<TE>   Humperdinck, often referred to as "The King of Romance," sold an
average of 5 million records a year from the 1960s to the late '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Tracey Hannum of Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills, had the listing
on the home Humperdinck purchased, and William Robertson of Coldwell
Banker represented Humperdinck, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Home looking like a winner</TE>
<TE>   Bob Baffert, trainer of such winning racehorses as War Emblem, and
his wife, Jill, have purchased a home in the new Arcadia community of
Anoakia Estates in the $1.7 million-to-$2 million range.</TE>
<TE>   Their house has five bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms in about 5,500
square feet. The home also has a playroom, master retreat, library
and detached pool house/cabana with an additional bathroom. The
Bafferts have been in the process of putting in their pool and
landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a front-row kind of guy, and this is definitely the front
row," Bob Baffert, 49, said of his new house.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, married in August, had been living in an Arcadia
townhouse before buying in the 31-home community, built on the site
of the historic Anita Baldwin mansion, which was razed a couple of
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert's business is based in Arcadia, with extensive barns at
Santa Anita Race Track. Besides War Emblem, he trains nearly 50
2-year-olds. War Emblem won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness this
year, but the horse ran eighth in the Belmont, missing the Triple
Crown. Even so, the thoroughbred is one pick to win the
horse-of-the-year honors in January at the Eclipse Awards in Beverly
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Record tycoon on the move again</TE>
<TE>   Ted Field, who established Interscope Records before selling it to
Universal for $330 million and has produced such movies as "Mr.
Holland's Opus" (1995) and "Runaway Bride" (1999), has listed his
gated estate on the edge of Beverly Hills at close to $9.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Field, who once owned silent-screen actor Harold Lloyd's Beverly
Hills estate known as Green Acres, likes to change houses every so
often. He has owned the home he is selling for about three years.</TE>
<TE>   The 1990 house has nine bedrooms and 12 bathrooms in about 20,000
square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The estate, on slightly more than an acre, also has an indoor
racquetball court, a disco/projection room, a rooftop tennis court, a
pool and two guest houses.</TE>
<TE>   After selling Interscope Records, Field took over ArtistDirect
Inc. and allocated most of its resources to its new record venture.
Field, a former race car driver, is an heir to the Marshall Field
department-store fortune in Chicago. Forbes put his net worth this
year at $1.2 billion and estimated his inheritance at $200 million.</TE>
<TE>   A successful TV as well as film producer, Field, who turned 50 in
June, won an Emmy Award with others in 1989 for their outstanding
children's program "A Mother's Courage: The Mary Thomas Story."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Shapiro of Westside Estate Agency, Beverly Hills, has the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   Kings' player lands a lease</TE>
<TE>   Jaroslav Bednar, a right wing with the L.A. Kings, and his wife,
Martina, have leased a two-bedroom townhouse behind gates in
Manhattan Beach for $3,200 a month.</TE>
<TE>   The 26-year-old hockey player agreed to terms of a one-year
contract with the Kings in August. He had four goals and two assists
in 22 games for the Kings last season. He also had 16 goals and 27
assists in 48 games for the Manchester Monarchs of the American
Hockey League. He is a native of the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, he was injured in a game when he suffered a
hyper-extended elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Cohen-Edwards of Shorewood Realtors, Manhattan Beach,
handled the lease transaction.</TE>

<HD>Her first and only</HD>
<DH>Actress Mitzi Gaynor and her agent husband bought their
Beverly Hills residence 42 years ago, and they still call the villa
home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ruth Ryon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mitzi Gaynor's Beverly Hills home is as upbeat as the cockeyed
optimist she played in the film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's
"South Pacific."</LD>
<LD>   She and her husband, producer-agent Jack Bean, have lived in the
canary-yellow home since 1960, two years after the movie was
released.</LD>
<LD>   After all those years, the actress has become attached to the
4,200-square-foot Spanish-style villa. "My house is a good friend,"
she said.</LD>
<TE>The couple, who were married before the movie came out, lived in an
apartment in L.A. and a flat in London before they bought. "It's the
only house we have lived in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gaynor, who won the hearts of audiences in such '50s films as
"Anything Goes" with Bing Crosby and "The Joker Is Wild" with Frank
Sinatra, is better known to younger fans for her many TV specials
over the decades. Her most recent special was last year. Gaynor also
has done considerable stage work and starred in a national tour in
1989-90 of "Anything Goes."</TE>
<TE>   She will appear with Tyne Daly, Dale Kristien, Stefanie Powers,
John Raitt and more than a dozen other performers Saturday at 8 p.m.
and next Sunday at 3 p.m. in "Something Wonderful," a concert
benefiting The Actors' Fund, which helps professionals in the
entertainment industry. The concert, at Cal State L.A., also will pay
tribute to the centennial of composer Richard Rodgers. Gaynor will
perform a number from "South Pacific."</TE>
<TE>   Gaynor is a singer and dancer as well as an actress. She took up
dancing at age 13 with the L.A. Civic Light Opera. She danced in her
20s when filming "South Pacific." On stage, in her annual "Mitzi
Gaynor Show," she also does stand-up comedy, including dialects, one
of which she attributes to her father, a cellist born in Hungary.</TE>
<TE>   At home, she often remembers her father when she cooks her
favorite dishes, many of which are Hungarian. She is, Bean said, "an
adventuresome cook," and it's not uncommon for her to cook for a
crowd, though she likes to hold dinners in her breakfast room, where
she can seat six.</TE>
<TE>   The couple never had children, but they like to entertain at home
and had that in mind even before they moved into their three-bedroom
house, built in the late 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   A Virgo and a stickler for detail, Gaynor had fallen in love with
the arches, original tile and such touches as the steel-lined bin for
firewood, but the newly established movie star wanted a pool where
she could entertain her new Hollywood friends.</TE>
<TE>   "So we took out some apple and peach trees and put in a pool, but
I have only been in it about three times," she admitted. She took
swimming lessons when filming "South Pacific." "If I have fins, I can
swim."</TE>
<TE>   The couple also created a sunroom or lanai, which now has
peach-colored walls. While building the room, they added arches and
doors, shaded today by blue-and-white awnings, which match the blue
and white accents on the front of the house. The doors in the sunroom
open onto the backyard and pool.</TE>
<TE>   Before moving in, Bean and Gaynor removed an elevator to make more
room for the stairwell leading to the second story and a door to the
garage. The elevator had been built for the wife of the previous
owner. She had heart trouble before dying in the house.</TE>
<TE>   One night, a few years after buying the home, Gaynor thought she
saw a specter when she returned tired from a rehearsal. A nude woman
seemed to be lounging against the entry wall.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a naked lady," Gaynor said, "so I called out,
'Jack, are you home?' " The nude turned out to be a nearly life-sized
painting that now hangs on the stairwell wall.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 years ago, Gaynor and Bean expanded the living room,
which has a baby grand piano and fireplace, to include a sitting area
with skylights and plantation shutters.</TE>
<TE>   At first their friends "didn't venture beyond the fireplace,"
Gaynor said. Now they all seem to like the area, which Gaynor says
"gives an airy feeling even in the rain."</TE>
<TE>   A couple of years ago, Bean was bored with his bathroom. "It all
started with my getting him some yellow towels," Gaynor said. "It
ended about $40,000 later."</TE>
<TE>   The bathroom wound up with yellow walls and a wall of mirrors. The
kitchen, with its apricot walls, and butler's pantry got new
cabinets.</TE>
<TE>   When the new cabinet doors in the butler's pantry started opening
and closing for no apparent reason and two chandeliers fell
inexplicably to the floor, Gaynor went into her entry hall and
summoned the spirit of the former woman of the house.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Look here, cut that out, or I will put in those ugly
sliding-glass doors to the pool area,' " Gaynor recalled. It might
sound silly, she said, but the cabinet doors stopped opening on their
own.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time that the new cabinets were installed, the
original moldings in the dining room were painted pink and green to
match a wreath Gaynor keeps in the entry. A set designer painted the
moldings and sponged red paint over the yellow walls of the breakfast
room to enhance its exotic look.</TE>
<TE>   He also painted the wooden fireplace mantle in the living room to
look like black marble. "If you have a fireplace, you're never
lonesome," Gaynor said she learned from actor Noel Coward.</TE>
<TE>   Warm area rugs complement the floors of Mexican pavers
and parquet, but original tiles on the stairs remain uncovered.
"Everybody wanted me to carpet over them," she said, "but I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   She loves flowers, particularly orchids and orchid plants, which
she has in nearly every room.</TE>
<TE>   There are some whimsical touches, such as an Italian-style
chandelier with a wooden monkey on it in the dining room and a china
chamber pot in the guest bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   And there are some collections of silver, china and jade, but
there is no visible Hollywood memorabilia. There are two portraits of
Gaynor by Jon Whitcomb in the house, she said, "but most of my
[show-biz] stuff is in storage."</TE>
<TE>   Gaynor once had a famous friend who had so many plaques honoring
himself that she could hardly get into his house.</TE>
<TE>   "I said I would never do that," she said. "I'm not a big collector
of memorabilia. I don't want my home to be a shrine to myself."</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Betting That Home Prices Will Cool Off" by Julie Bawden
Davis, Oct. 13: What we are witnessing now with the real estate
market is a parallel of the Internet stock bubble of just over 1 1/2
years ago as well as the real estate bubble burst of the early to
mid-'90s.</LD>
<LD>   As with the Internet bubble, all common sense and traditional
means of valuation have been tossed aside. If you want to negotiate
on one of these inflated beauties, the selling agent will politely
escort you to the door.</LD>
<LD>   With homes selling at a record pace and for record prices, it
seems as if all of the lessons of the past have been tossed aside or
forgotten.</LD>
<TE>   History, unfortunately, always exacts a hefty price of those who
fail to remember it.</TE>

<LD>Let me try to understand this. A homeowner sues an insurer to pay for
repairs to rotting decks, and a judge orders the company to pay to
"prevent loss of lives and to save money for the insurance company."
("Rotting Decks: a Clear and Present Danger" by Robert J. Bruss, Oct.
13.) Now I know why rates are skyrocketing and some companies are
getting out of the business ("Learning to Manage High Insurance
Costs" by Lew Sichelman, Oct. 13). I wonder if I can sue my auto
insurer to pay to replace worn brakes because they might cause an
accident?</LD>

<HD>Time to fall back into water conservation</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A week after switching from daylight saving time, are your sprinklers
still operating on the old time and on summer cycles?</LD>
<LD>   The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is
encouraging homeowners to consider rolling back the use of garden
sprinklers now that plants and lawns are less thirsty because of the
cooling weather.</LD>
<LD>   Before switching off those sprinklers, however, switch on the
computer, because the district has a new Internet-accessible
sprinkler calculator and sprinkler index on its Web site (mwdh2o.com)
to help with your water conservation efforts.</LD>
<TE>   The virtual calculator, developed by the city of San Diego, is
designed to help users customize watering needs. By entering your ZIP
Code, landscape areas, plant and grass types and soil condition, the
calculator can come up with a 12-month watering guide.</TE>
<TE>   The goal: To save water and money. The district, a cooperative of
26 cities and water agencies serving six counties, maintains that by
reducing outdoor water use by 10%, residents on average can save
about $225 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The sprinkler index is based on data that gauge the amount of
moisture lost to the atmosphere. The index, which is updated weekly,
is designed for those with automated sprinklers that require a number
to be input to set watering times in one step.</TE>

<HD>An Old South African Synagogue and Its Members Still Thrive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As an immigrant who grew up in Cape Town, South Africa, in the
seaside suburb of Muizenberg, I would like to point out to Ted Botha
("Cape Town's Double Delights," Special Travel Issue, Oct. 13) that
while I applaud his article and welcome the beautiful photographs of
the town of my youth, his information is not quite correct.</LD>
<LD>   The well-maintained synagogue of which he speaks still has an
incredible community made up of core members such as my parents, Abe
and Pearl Davis, who have been members for more than 50 years. While
the membership has dwindled substantially, it has been revived by the
migration of Jewish families from various parts of South Africa to
the False Bay seaboard, and the small group of regulars play a vital
role in the city's Jewish life.</LD>
<LD>   The women's guild is known throughout South Africa for its
incredible catering, and the men have formed the most beautiful
choir. Some illustrious members of the world's Jewish community have
worshipped there, thanks to the membership of a prominent person in
the World Jewish Congress who has a home in the nearby enclave of St.
James. So let it be known that Jewish tourists will be enchanted and
welcomed into the Muizenberg Hebrew Congregation's midst should they
attend a Friday night or Saturday morning service at the synagogue
that Botha mistakenly believes is devoid of a congregation.</LD>

<HD>Another Look at Copyright Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mickey Mouse and I don't usually see eye to eye, but on the issue of
copyright protection, the rodent and his handlers have it right ("The
Cultural Anarchist vs. the Hollywood Police State," by David
Streitfeld, Sept. 22). Why should copyright be the only property
right that is time-limited? We don't require that Bill Gates
surrender his fortune to the public domain or that David Geffen deed
his Malibu beach house to us. Why should the heirs not inherit the
rich guys' stuff? It's the American way.</LD>
<LD>   For the struggling writer, artist or musician, copyright is a
valuable asset. While the original work may not be successful
immediately, the future exploitation of the copyright may prove a
bonanza. Why else would the rodent and his Hollywood pals always be
on the lookout to buy hot properties?</LD>
<LD>   If the quixotic Larry Lessig really needs a cause to champion,
maybe he should tackle the problem of creative people who are
manipulated into selling off their copyrights far too quickly and
cheaply. That's where the real injustice lies.</LD>
<TE>   Ursula Britton</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The unique combination of digital technologies and the Internet,
from which corporate America was intending to profit when the
government relinquished control over the Internet and placed it in
the hands of business, has created an additional scenario that no one
foresaw: placing into the hands of the average consumer the same
power to distribute images, sounds and text that had been reserved
only for the largest corporations.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting efforts by the entertainment industry to discourage
this behavior has, so far, either proved fruitless, had very limited
success or has angered and upset many citizens--some of whom have
been emboldened to ignore and even flout current law. Efforts by the
entertainment industry to further restrict what is perceived as fair
use of copyrighted material is aggravating the problem even more.
Extending copyright appears to be seen as an effort to benefit
corporations, not the average citizen or society as a whole. There
appears to be little or no effort toward a sincere dialogue or
understanding of both sides, which could go far in resolving the
matter and evolve the current distribution of entertainment into
something far greater than it is now.</TE>

<TE>   By Edith Pattou</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Spitzer is a wise teacher who knows many things. She knows
about gardens and children. She knows how similar they are. There are
many remarkable teachers like Mrs. Spitzer in the world. Here is a
book to celebrate all they do, year after year, to help our children
grow and blossom. I liked this story because the children grow older
and when the year is over, Mrs. Spitzer has a new garden.</TE>

<LD>Kerry burst into the farmhouse kitchen. "Grand- ma! Have you heard
the news? The Leonid is coming tonight!"</LD>
<LD>   "Good thing I'm cooking a big supper," she said. "I didn't know I
was having so much company."</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, Grandma," Kerry said. "A Leonid isn't a person. It's a meteor
shower. I'm going to stay up all night to see it."</LD>
<TE>   A moment later, the rest of Kerry's family came in, carrying
sleeping bags.</TE>
<TE>   "Looks like we're having a slumber party," Grandma said.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as Grandpa came in from the fields, they sat down to eat
supper. In mid-November it got dark early and they had a lot to do
before they went to bed.</TE>
<TE>   Grandpa and Dad arranged chairs on the deck. They stacked extra
blankets beside the door. Grandma made hot chocolate and poured it
into thermoses to stay hot.</TE>
<TE>   Then they got ready for bed. Kerry said, "The rest of you can
sleep if you want to, but I'm not. I'm going to make sure I see the
meteors." His brothers crawled into their sleeping bags. So did
Kerry. "But I'm not sleeping," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly it was 2 in the morning. "Kerry," Dad whispered. "Time to
wake up."</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't asleep," Kerry whispered, yawning.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone put on jackets and grabbed blankets as they went out on
the deck. The night air was freezing cold.</TE>
<TE>   "Brrr," said Kerry. He sipped the hot chocolate that Grandma
handed him.</TE>
<TE>   Then Dad said, "Look up everyone. Look at our nighttime sky."</TE>
<TE>   Kerry looked. The sky glimmered with stars. They twinkled. They
glittered.</TE>
<TE>   Then Kerry saw a streak of brightness. Then another and another.
"Meteors!" he shouted. "It's raining meteors!"</TE>
<TE>   "Beautiful," Grandma whispered.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry burrowed deeper in his blanket as he watched the silent
spectacle. He nodded sleepily. "Beautiful," he echoed. "I can't wait
until they come again next year."</TE>
<TE>   Author's note: For many years, meteor watchers have waited to see
the greatest of all meteor showers flash through the sky each
mid-November. Many meteors may appear in the Leonid shower, named
after the constellation Leo. Sometimes only a few share their
brilliance. Many people will be watching again this year. Will you?
They will be back for a repeat performance this month.</TE>

<DH>We Can Put Throwaway Kids in Prison, but That Doesn't Mean
They'll Be Quiet</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kerry Madden</AU>
<BD>Novelist Kerry Madden is the author of "Writing Smarts:
A Girl's Guide to Journaling, Poetry, Storytelling and School
Papers."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I visit Michael Duc Ta in prison, my writing student wants to
discuss "Jude the Obscure," Thomas Hardy's 1895 novel. It means
thinking back to when I was an exchange student in rainy Manchester,
England, studying 19th century literature in 1982--the same year Duc
was born to Vietnamese boat parents at what was then Queen of Angels
Hospital in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The trappings of the prison visiting room are a far cry from my
"Women in 19th Century Literature" tutorial. As Duc launches into
Hardy, a sleepy woman nearby spreads out a vending machine feast for
her boyfriend, who has yet to appear in his prison denim. A mother
grabs up her son as he enters with a guard, and she refuses to let
go.</LD>
<LD>   While these dramas play out around us, Duc is away in England with
Jude, a stonemason who fills his mind with books and longs for higher
education, but who has a string of bad luck in love and life that
leaves him forever short of his goals. Duc shakes his head and asks,
"How could Jude love Sue still after all the stuff she puts him
through? All for what? Nothing! What do you think?"</LD>
<TE>   I explain that the 5 a.m. drive isn't helping my memory and say,
"Could you tell me the story again?" Duc's eyes flash as he describes
how Jude and Sue's love brought them only heartache. I understand why
he relates so passionately to Jude. They both desperately seek an
education. Jude wants Oxford. Duc wants to get his GED, since he
tested highly gifted in English before being sent to prison.
(Novelist Mark Salzman called him the most talented and motivated
writer he encountered during his three years teaching at the juvenile
facility.) But Duc has been waiting two years for prison officials to
administer the test that could give him the equivalent of a high
school diploma.</TE>
<TE>   Duc is serving time for attempted murder. At age 16, he drove a
car involved in a gang shooting. Duc had no priors, was not the
shooter and no one was injured, but the state pressed charges. The
judge advised him to take 15-to-life. Duc agreed. But the two
juveniles arrested with him did not. It was a package deal. The case
went to trial and the three were sentenced 35 years to life. At his
sentencing, the same judge told Duc not to feel too bad because he'd
still be "younger than I am today" when he is released.</TE>
<TE>   Unless things change, Duc, now 20, will be eligible for parole in
the year 2031. He will be 49. He faces an appeal hearing this month.
He may get a new trial, or the court might order resentencing, or the
decision could stand. According to statistics, the appellate court
overturns lower court decisions in less than 4% of cases.</TE>
<TE>   So Duc is working on his writing, and he sends me his work to
critique. I gave him an exercise called "I Remember." He gave me
this:</TE>
<TE>   I remember coming home late one night. I remember the look on my
mother's face, a look of lost hope. I remember sitting in my room
trying to find clothes that were thick so the impact of my father's
hits wouldn't mark me. I remember him walking through the door like a
madman. I remember the first swipe to the face that blinded me as he
lost control. I remember it felt like hours before the beating ended.</TE>
<TE>   Duc's memories are consistent with police records and court
documents, and I cannot help but think of my three children,
especially my son, Flannery, now a teenager. Both Flannery and Duc
love the TV show "Smallville" and the Dodgers. Both wore braces, but
their experiences could not have been more different. My son's
orthodontist has smiling clerks who soften their presentation of a
$500 fee with, "Gee, what a pretty sweater!" Duc went into juvenile
hall with his braces. They stayed on for three years before a prison
dentist removed them with pliers.</TE>
<TE>   Duc had asked me about my three children, and hadn't seen a child
in more than three years, so on my next visit, after discussing it
with my husband, I take our 3-year-old, Norah. Together they stack
Scrabble tiles into castles, and Duc grins a lot. When we say
goodbye, Norah gives him butterfly kisses. My husband gives me
earrings and prayer stones he bought at a nearby Indian powwow while
he waited for us.</TE>
<TE>   I wish I could give Duc prayer stones.</TE>
<TE>   We drive through the Mojave heat toward home. Duc sends a letter
about how much he enjoyed meeting Norah. His godmother sends him
books regularly--he was then reading "This Boy's Life" and
"Frankenstein"--and he says he never knew that, in prison, reading
would open up the world to him. Michael Duc Ta also writes poetry,
and he wrote this:</TE>
<TE>   Today's younger</TE>
<TE>   Generation of incarceration</TE>
<TE>   Must be a joke</TE>
<TE>   Sending a kid</TE>
<TE>   Off with life</TE>
<TE>   Without parole</TE>
<TE>   Seeing society smile</TE>
<TE>   Because they threw away a child...</TE>

<HD>ECHO PARK TABLEAUX</HD>
<DH>Street level views of one of L.A.'s most vibrant
communities, before it becomes the next Silver Lake</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VINCE BEISER</AU>
<BD>Photographer Gregg Segal and writer Vince Beiser last
collaborated for the magazine on a photo essay about life on Fremont
Street in Las Vegas. More photographs of Echo Park are available at
greggsegal.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ECHO PARK IS ONE OF LOS ANGELES' OLDEST AND MOST INTRIGUING
neighborhoods, a down-market collage of small dance clubs and
family-run restaurants, low-key hipster hangouts and storefront tarot
card readers. Its grocery stores sell menudo mix alongside pickled
lotus stalks. Its Methodist church offers services in four languages.</LD>
<LD>   The neighborhood, bounded roughly by Riverside Drive and Temple
Street to the north and south, Benton Way and Elysian Park to the
west and east, has long been a blue-collar stronghold of Chinese,
Filipino and Mexican and Central American immigrants. In the last few
years, however, an infiltration has begun. Several independent
galleries, a designer clothing boutique, a skate shop, a hipster
record store and an arty cafe have sprouted amid the Asian grocery
stores and Mexican dress shops. By all appearances, the early stages
of the classic cycle of urban gentrification have begun: pioneering
artists and young urbanites move into a low-rent ethnic neighborhood
and make it interesting and appealing for higher-end yuppies, who
drive prices up and earlier inhabitants out until the area loses its
distinct character.</LD>
<TE>   Echo Park's undeniable ugly side--its gangs and graffiti and
shabbiness--may keep the upscale invasion from progressing too far.
Though many residents say the streets have grown much safer in recent
years, Echo Park's notorious gangs are still busy. The LAPD logged
hundreds of gang-related crimes in the neighborhood, including a
half-dozen murders, in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite those problems, rents and housing prices are shooting
up, forcing some longtime residents to move. And the neighborhood has
acquired the ultimate symbol of gentrification as generification: its
first Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at Echo Park and nearby streets before they fade to
hip.</TE>

sunshine, peels back to reveal the brick wall of this parking lot on
Figueroa near the juncture of Sunset Boulevard and Cesar E. Chavez
Avenue on the fringes of Echo Park. The whole block is similarly
layered, similarly multicolored: Next door is a burger joint offering
"American and Hispanic Food," and next to that is the tiny,
boarded-up Kim Ling movie house.</CP>

the many strolling mariachis who play the Latino restaurants in Echo
Park and neighboring Silver Lake. At one of those popular dining
spots, Francisco Sandoval (left foreground, middle photo), his son
Javier and a friend listen to the music of Hugo Perez and Raymundo
Martinez. The Sandovals are members of an extensive Mexican American
clan that has called Echo Park home for decades. Dozens live on a
single block near this Sunset Boulevard seafood restaurant. "We were
raised here," says Rose Camez, a cousin of Francisco. "But if rents
keep going up, we may have to leave."</CP>

on a rail outside the one-bedroom apartment he shares with his wife
and four children. It's a little crowded, he says, but it's cheap,
quiet and safe. A spike-topped gate restricts access to their small
apartment complex, which is next to the Phouc Hing Market and across
the street from a Cambodian Buddhist temple. Three of his wife's
brothers and their families live nearby. Llamas says he has more than
a dozen relatives on this block, including his nephew Junior, proud
owner of Bambi, the suspicious Chihuahua. "The kids all grow up
together," says Llamas, a cook who has lived in Echo Park since 1992.
"It's better to be united."</CP>

he says. "But if this is what God wants, I will stay here."</CP>

<HD>The Fixer</HD>
<DH>Willis Edwards Is the Consummate Operator, Moving From One
Black Power Circle to Another. He Inspires Admiration--and Contempt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John L. Mitchell</AU>
<BD>John L. Mitchell is a Times staff writer whose last
article for the magazine was an interview with Rodney King.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Willis Edwards had been in some deep holes before, but nothing had
prepared him for that moment, late in 1996, when he arrived at the
Veterans Administration hospital in Westwood, 130 pounds left on his
6-foot-3 frame, suffering from AIDS.</LD>
<LD>   For most of his life, Edwards had been a master manipulator within
black power circles. He was an operator--a fixer--with a talent for
endearing himself to anyone with clout. He'd talked network
executives into making the NAACP's Image Awards a nationally
televised event. He'd been the California advance man on the Rev.
Jesse Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign. He'd smoothed the way for
Nelson Mandela's trip to Los Angeles shortly after the South African
anti-apartheid leader's release from prison.</LD>
<LD>   You couldn't help but admire Edwards' brashness. And you couldn't
help but understand the contempt he sometimes generated for his
unbridled wheeling and dealing--for being a man who, without wealth
or political office or a car or a 9-to-5 job, through raw gifts and
sheer guff, insinuated himself into the highest levels of influence.</LD>
<TE>   But now it was gone, all the compulsive deal-making juice, all the
confidence. His vast network had dwindled to a handful of friends and
relatives who knew about his AIDS and were organizing to help him
recover. He staggered weakly from the hospital with his new regimen
of drugs. Doctors told him he didn't have long.</TE>
<TE>   And then, a few weeks later, came a phone call from the mother of
the civil rights movement, Rosa Parks, who'd gotten to know Edwards
years earlier during one of her frequent winter stays in Los Angeles.
Parks stopped by for dinner and prayers as he was convalescing, and
shortly after he was asked if he would help Parks raise the profile
of her civil-rights institute in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The story of what happened next--how Willis Edwards placed
86-year-old Rosa Parks next to Hillary Clinton at the 1999 State of
the Union address, where the president praised her lavishly--was a
fixer's crowning moment. Edwards created a buzz that brought Parks
the most attention since 1955, when she refused to give up a bus seat
to a white man in Montgomery, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Parks went to the Oscars, had an audience with the pope and
received a Congressional Gold Medal--all orchestrated with Edwards'
help. And he negotiated a six-figure payment to Parks for her life
story, which was televised this year.</TE>
<TE>   With his spirits and health bolstered by a new sense of purpose,
Edwards captured a regional seat on the NAACP's national board and
became a key player in veteran state lawmaker Diane Watson's
successful bid for Congress last year. He was on a roll, answering
the critics who accused him of being out for himself, and telling
everyone he knew that despite his fragile health he wasn't throwing
in the towel, just wiping off a little sweat.</TE>
<TE>   "People said I was a goner," he says. "But sickness is an
attitude. I refused to buy into it."</TE>
<TE>   If Edwards' life were a TV movie, the music director would be
bringing up the stringed instruments about now. But they don't make
TV movies about 56-year-old middlemen, not even ones with
coast-to-coast connections. Yes, he's the guy to call when you need a
floor pass on nominating night at the Democratic National Convention
or a ticket to a sold-out Patti LaBelle concert at the Greek Theatre.
But the perks Edwards dishes out often come at a price. He's also the
guy who, when he spots you in a restaurant, joins your table, surveys
the menu and orders the lobster.</TE>
<TE>   Yet you pick up the tab because you feel that, sooner or later, it
will pay to know this guy because he knows so many people and he
knows how to get a job done, damn the rules.</TE>
<TE>   When I tell Edwards I'm interested in profiling him, my phone
starts to ring off the hook. ''Willis told me to call and add my two
cents to the nice, large and favorable article you're doing on him,''
says one recorded message.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards rattles off a long list of "friends" he'd like me to call:
Julian Bond, Johnnie R. Carr, Dorothy Height, C. DeLores Tucker,
Sheila Frazier, Beverly Todd, Judy Pace-Flood, Freda Payne, Cicely
Tyson, Denise Nicholas, Angela Bassett, Ethel Bradley, Myrlie
Evers-Williams, Jesse and Jacqueline Jackson, Bernard and Shirley
Kinsey, Brock Peters, Julie Dash, Bill Elkins, Virna Canson, Benjamin
Hooks . . .</TE>
<TE>   "Willis, stop!" I say. "This is an article, not your phone book.
The story is only going to be so long."</TE>
<TE>   ''How long, brother?''</TE>
<TE>   "Well, it's not the whole magazine."</TE>
<TE>   ''Bruh-ther," Edwards says, exasperated, "you must learn how to
negotiate.''</TE>
<TE>   Eedwards was born in Carthage, Texas, in 1946, and grew up in Palm
Springs, but his reputation as a hard-nosed negotiator started in
college, at Cal State Los Angeles, where he was active in student
government. Edwards was a 22-year-old sophomore when Martin Luther
King was assassinated in 1968. With money saved up from bagging
groceries, he joined a large contingent of mourners that flew to
Atlanta for the funeral. He was signed on to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's
1968 presidential campaign and was among the cheering onlookers at
the Ambassador Hotel celebrating Kennedy's victory in the California
primary when the senator was assassinated. The next year, he walked
precincts for a city councilman named Tom Bradley, who was defeated
in a bitter mayoral race by incumbent Sam Yorty. By that time,
Edwards had been drafted and was on a two-week military furlough
before heading out to Vietnam. He spent 14 months in Southeast Asia,
was wounded slightly in a land-mine explosion and returned home to
Los Angeles with a Bronze Star.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Cal State L.A. students who greeted him at the airport
was student body president Steve Cooley, later to become L.A. County
district attorney. With Cooley's support, Edwards would be elected
the first black student body president in the school's history. He
also became a director of the National Student Lobby and head of its
state operation. After graduation, Edwards was hired by USC to be its
director of black student services. When Bradley defeated Yorty in
1973, he appointed Edwards to the city's Social Services Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards quickly developed a habit of turning up in places where he
was least expected.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, Myrlie Evers Williams, activist and widow of
slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, flew from Los Angeles to
Washington, D.C., for a sold-out performance at the Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts. She saw Edwards, a familiar face, wearing a
white denim tuxedo with satin lapels. As the crowd of luminaries
meandered toward their seats, Edwards took Williams' arm and shouted
commandingly, "Mrs. Medgar Evers coming through!"</TE>
<TE>   ''It was like Moses parting the water,'' Williams recalls. ''I was
embarrassed and started rushing through. But Willis had my arm. He
slowed me down. He wanted me to pace my walk and just float on
through.''</TE>
<TE>   By the time the show started, Willis was gone. He had told
Williams he didn't have a ticket. Yet during intermission, Williams
looked around and saw him. ''He was in the presidential box. How he
got there? I don't know. But he was there smiling and shaking
hands.''</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, Edwards arrived at the Democratic National Convention in
New York City, planning to sleep on the floor of a hotel room shared
by Diane Watson, then a member of the Los Angeles Unified School
District board, and Gwen Moore, then a community college district
trustee. He talked his way into a position on the delegate
credentials committee and ended up escorting Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis to a meeting with party chairman Robert Strauss and Chicago
Mayor Richard Daley. Edwards asked Onassis if she wanted to also meet
Bradley, who was being honored at the convention, and she said yes.
''The mayor stood up like a little boy, like the queen was summoning
him." Edwards brought him in and then looked around the room at JFK's
widow, Strauss, Bradley and Daley. Willis Edwards was in his glory:
the fly on the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Through his work in credentialing, Edwards landed a hotel room and
also ended up with some influence over convention seating. He
wrangled a limo for Bradley and slipped Watson and Moore into a VIP
box next to Onassis and actors Yul Brynner and Lauren Bacall. (''They
needed some black faces in that picture,'' he rationalized.) From
their vantage point on the final nominating night of the convention,
Watson and Moore watched as Edwards, who had called in a chit from
Bradley, was introduced as L.A.'s youngest commissioner and led the
Pledge of Allegiance.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards came home inspired to be more than a fly on the wall. In
1978, he ran for an Assembly seat against Moore and seven other
candidates. She defeated Edwards, despite backing from Bradley and
the Rev. Jesse Jackson. His effort was marred by rumors that he was
gay. (Edwards refuses to answer questions about his sexuality: "It's
nobody's business.") But he was about to begin a new chapter.</TE>
<TE>   By 1980 Edwards had been a force in the small Beverly
Hills-Hollywood branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of
Colored People and became interested in the Image Awards, the
organization's annual dinner salute of the entertainment industry. At
a time when Hollywood was being criticized for not doing enough to
promote and recognize the careers of African Americans, the Image
Awards were a valued evening of recognition for the industry--and
offered new connections.</TE>
<TE>   When Paramount wanted to gauge black reaction to the movie "White
Dog," a film about a German shepherd trained to attack blacks, it
hired Edwards and another man as private consultants. They gave the
movie a thumbs-down, and the picture was shelved. The film's director
blasted the studio's decision, accusing Edwards of acting like a
"paid censor."</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, Edwards became president of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood
branch of the NAACP and went on the attack, accusing the movie and TV
industries of failing to hire blacks in key positions in front of and
behind the cameras. He threatened to call for national boycotts and
take action against advertisers. He also sold the first of two taped
Image Awards shows for national syndication, a prelude to his goal of
a live network telecast.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, with "The Cosby Show" tops in TV ratings, the NAACP
branch decided to honor Bill Cosby with the Medgar Evers Medal of
Honor, an award created for the occasion. NBC President Brandon
Tartikoff was persuaded to present Cosby with the award at the
Beverly Wilshire in front of an audience that included Miles Davis,
Cicely Tyson, Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier. When Tartikoff went
to the men's room, Edwards followed. After a brief discussion,
Tartikoff agreed to put the Image Awards on NBC. The announcement was
made during the show to thunderous applause.</TE>
<TE>   The branch became energized. It swelled with new members recruited
by Edwards from USC and local churches in South Los Angeles and
artists frustrated over a lack of opportunities. But some longtime
members suspected that Edwards was exploiting his unpaid position for
personal gain.</TE>
<TE>   "We were volunteers," says Bob Jones, now vice president of
Michael Jackson's MJJ Productions. "They [Edwards and his allies]
were living off the NAACP. I have never known Willis to hold down a
job."</TE>
<TE>   At one Image Awards, Tavis Smiley, then a young aide to Bradley,
used his credit card to rent a Lincoln Town Car for Edwards, but
Edwards would not turn the car in. ''The bill was enormous." Smiley
recalls. "I'm a young kid, not making any money. He eventually made
good on it but it tested our relationship.''</TE>
<TE>   Edwards dismisses the episode.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand what the big deal is," he says. "Tavis was
paid."</TE>
<TE>   Comedian Arsenio Hall went further, condemning Edwards as an
"extortionist" and "tennis-shoe pimp" in 1988. Edwards, Hall claimed,
had threatened to go public with a complaint that Hall had not hired
a sufficient number of blacks to work on his talk show. For a $40,000
contribution to the NAACP, Edwards was willing to remain silent, Hall
said. In response, Edwards filed a $10-million defamation lawsuit
against Hall. The lawsuit was eventually settled for a substantial
sum, Edwards says. Hall would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards was reelected branch president in 1989, but resigned that
same year amid criticism that the branch wasn't keeping a tight rein
on its finances. He was also under fire for taking a $25,000 payment
to be co-executive producer for the Image Awards, and the national
NAACP took over the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards lost his national platform, but that didn't slow him down.
"He has always been someone who comes out of the ashes," says Sandra
Evers-Manly, president of the Black Hollywood Education and Resource
Center.</TE>
<TE>   He focused on local issues, such as coordinating Mandela's visit
to Los Angeles, working on Watson's losing campaign for the Board of
Supervisors and operating inside Bradley's entourage. He put together
a video salute to Bradley after he suffered a heart attack and
stroke. But he remained bitter about the controversy over the Image
Awards. He felt betrayed, both by the national organization and by
the branch members who revolted against his leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "I got into my own life," he says. And then AIDS intruded.</TE>
<TE>   His family, like many of his friends, had watched in silence as
his weight decreased, suspecting the worst. Now Edwards was forced to
tell people he had "the virus," to admit that he needed help with
transportation, housing, food and medication. He was staying with a
friend in View Park, one of Los Angeles' wealthiest black
neighborhoods, in early 1997, when he learned that Rosa Parks was
going to visit.</TE>
<TE>   Willis Edwards was 9 when Rosa Parks' simple act of civil
disobedience rocked the nation and captured his childhood
imagination. He first met her in 1980, when he escorted her at the
Image Awards where she was honored. "Rosa Parks stands for
something," he says. "Children write stories about her. I've walked
in a room, a restaurant with her and watched. People start
whispering: 'Rosa Parks is here! Rosa Parks is here!' And they start
clapping."</TE>
<TE>   And now she was going to visit him. "I got on the phone and
started calling people. 'Rosa Parks is coming to my house!' There is
a network of people and if you call them, you know the word will
spread around the city." The visit lasted three hours.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards regained some of his strength throughout the year. By 1998
he was back in step, organizing events for Parks. A week before the
Oscars, with the help of a high school friend who was coordinating
red carpet arrivals at the event, Edwards scored seventh-row seats
and a police motorcade for Rosa Parks, approved by then-Police Chief
Bernard Parks. She walked down the red carpet with Edwards on her
arm.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards was looking healthier than many people had seen him in a
long time. He was eating well and walking every day in Griffith Park.
It was on one of his early morning walks that Edwards imagined Rosa
Parks in the gallery--in the first lady's box--when President Clinton
delivered the 1999 State of the Union speech. The political
calculation was easy: Clinton, immensely popular with blacks and
facing impeachment, was likely to welcome the public relations glow
from Parks. Edwards called the White House and got nowhere. So he
employed elemental leverage: He called the staff of House Republican
Leader Dennis Hastert (R-Ill), who said that Hastert would be more
than happy to seat Parks in the speaker's box with his wife, Jean.
That accomplished, Edwards called a friend over in the White House.
Do you know Dennis Hastert has agreed to seat Rosa Parks in his box?
"I'll get back to you," was the reply. Within minutes, Edwards had
secured a seat next to Hillary Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   ''We know it's been a long journey," Clinton told Congress in his
speech as he described an initiative to bridge the racial divide.
"For some it goes back to before the beginning of our republic, for
others back since the Civil War, for others throughout the 20th
century. But for most of us alive today, in a very real sense this
journey began 43 years ago when a woman named Rosa Parks sat down on
a bus in Alabama and wouldn't get up. She's sitting down with the
first lady tonight, and she may get up or not as she chooses. We
thank her." It was the loudest applause of the night, and Edwards
felt vindicated. Only now, he told himself, did the initially
resistant Clinton staff members get it.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards "could see the picture, the image and the power of the
image," says Minyon Moore, then the political director at the White
House. "Once he has that idea and image in his head, you can forget
it. It will become a reality."</TE>
<TE>   The speech made other things possible. Parks flew to St. Louis to
meet with Pope John Paul II. And Rep. Julia Carson (D-Indiana)
nominated her for a Congressional Gold Medal, which required
two-thirds approval of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Tavis Smiley, by now a contributor to a nationally syndicated
black-oriented radio network in 100 U.S. markets, got a call from
Edwards. "Brother, I have a little project for you," Edwards said.
Smiley agreed to broadcast the names of those who had not signed the
legislation. Within weeks there were more than enough signatures to
place Parks among the select group receiving the highest award
bestowed by the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds gathered in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in June in
1999 as Clinton, top lawmakers and civil rights leaders honored Parks
with a congressional medal designed by African American artist Artis
Lane--a Willis touch. That same year, she received an honorary
doctoral degree from USC. When Parks needed a place to stay in
Washington, D.C., Edwards arranged for her to check in at the Mansion
on O Street, a luxury hotel. "I'll put her up free for life," H.H.
Leonard, the owner, told Edwards. In 2000, Parks' institute obtained
more than $1 million in federal and private donations, the largest
amount it has garnered in a single year. And Troy State University
Montgomery's Rosa Parks Library Museum opened up on the site of the
Empire Theater--at the same spot where Parks was arrested on that bus
in 1955. Meanwhile, "The Rosa Parks Story," a television movie that
aired in February, began preparation, with Edwards as executive
producer.</TE>
<TE>   The surge of energy Edwards experienced from working with Parks
soon pushed him back to the NAACP. He was elected to the national
board in 1999 and two years later encouraged the national civil
rights organization to have its annual board meeting in Los Angeles,
the first time in its 93-year history. He was appointed by Chairman
Julian Bond to the committee that oversees the Image Awards. He was
also the parliamentarian of the NAACP's convention in Houston this
past July.</TE>
<TE>   At last year's convention in New Orleans, Edwards spoke about the
hardships of living with HIV.</TE>
<TE>   "The NAACP, after initially not having the best attitude [about
AIDS], has overcome that, and to a large extent we have Willis to
thank for that," Bond says. "Here is a functioning person whom we
know."</TE>
<TE>   But Edwards is not always an easy person to know. "He lives on his
wits and flashes of brilliance," says Watson. "Willis is that pilot
light that sparks the fire that cooks the food."</TE>
<TE>   He was an early spark in her decision to run for the congressional
seat left vacant by the death of Julian Dixon. She was U.S.
Ambassador to Micronesia when Edwards called, urging her to run and
then becoming instrumental in her campaign's fund-raising. (He
receives a percentage of the funds he raises.) "He has a gift of
making the deal," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Watson did not offer Edwards a congressional staff job
after her victory.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't say, 'Willis, go do this and that and bring back a
report,' " she says. "He's too compulsive. He works for the moment."
She describes her longtime friend as a free spirit who wouldn't work
well in a structured environment.</TE>
<TE>   After walking six miles in the hills of Griffith Park, Edwards
sits down one morning to breakfast: oatmeal, eggs (easy over), toast,
peaches, hash browns, milk, orange juice and coffee. The medication
makes it difficult to taste the food he is eating, but he has to eat
a heavy meal to maintain his weight. He's been told he has diabetes.
He has good days and bad days.</TE>
<TE>   He's trying to interest the mother of Emmet Till, the teenager
whose death at the hands of racists in Mississippi was another major
civil rights outrage of 1955, in a movie deal. He worries about his
87-year-old mother's comfort and the future for his nieces and
nephews. He'd like to buy a car and move out of his two-bedroom
apartment and into a house. He's mulling whether to write his
autobiography.</TE>
<TE>   Interesting. What would the Edwards' legacy be? I ask. For once
his tongue freezes. He offers the legacies of others, of unsung
heroes in Los Angeles, people such as the late Rev. Thomas Kilgore of
Second Baptist Church, and South-Central social activists such as
Mary Henry and Lillian Mobley. But not his.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I have to think about," he says. "Give me 20
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   "No, Willis," I say. "You like to negotiate. Let's negotiate your
legacy."</TE>
<TE>   "I can't define my legacy to you," he says. "It's better for
others to say."</TE>
<TE>   I realize that a middleman has no legacy without the people whose
lives he travels between. The legacy of a middleman is: He loved the
game. He loved getting people on the outside inside the door. He
liked to make sure the people he admired got invited to dinner. And
he always made sure he had a good seat.</TE>

<DH>Pairing Wine With Mexican Food Doesn't Happen as Often as
One Critic Thinks It Should</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRUCE CASS</AU>
<BD>Bruce Cass teaches at Pacific Rim Wine Education Center
in San Francisco and is the author and editor of the "Oxford
Companion to Wines of North America."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico may be the historic site of the first commercial winery to
operate outside Europe (near Parras, founded in 1596), but Mexico is
not traditionally a wine-drinking culture. Today Muslim Algeria
consumes more wine per capita than does Catholic Mexico. So it's no
surprise that customers at Mexican restaurants generally opt for cold
beer or for tequila-based margaritas. But contrary to common belief,
when paired correctly, spicy food and fine wine are a better match
than cocktails or beer. And here in California, where we consume one
and a half times more wine per capita than do Americans overall, it's
a match that makes sense. Los Angeles is perhaps the region where
California's fine wine influence most vigorously overlaps Latino
culture and where Mexican restaurants are increasingly offering wine
on their lists. But there are good marriages and then there are great
ones. And, to maximize your dining experience--whether at home or out
on the town--here are a few navigational tips for most successfully
wedding the wine with the food.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, the best wines for serving with dishes that are high in
capsicum heat are French-American hybrids, which aren't widely grown
in California. These wines tend to have low tannin, low alcohol,
modest acid and are often a little sweet and fruity. Grapes such as
Chambourcin, Chancellor, Norton, Marechal Foch and Leon Millot thrive
in the Northeast and Midwest of America because they are resistant to
vine diseases such as powdery mildew that are common in humid summer
climates. They are also better able than Cabernets and Chardonnays to
survive low winter temperatures. Hybrid reds feature dark stone fruit
aromas so powerful they border on floral candies. Compared to
Cabernets and Zinfandels, hybrid reds seem lightweight, which is a
smooth contrast with spicy chiles, particularly when these wines are
slightly chilled. Two other Mexican food staples, frijoles and fried
corn tortillas, have a satisfying, earthy richness that goes well
with aged full-body white wines with nutty characteristics, such as a
quality Italian Soave or a Semillon, and Rhone varieties such as
Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier. It may seem indulgent to serve a
$75 Condrieu (a Viognier from France's northern Rhone region) with a
$2 snack of quesadillas, but of just such a juxtaposition is
noteworthy art made. A less-expensive alternative is serving a
lusciously ripe, fruity-buttery California Chardonnay with posole, a
thick corn soup with pork and chiles. The Chardonnay's richness
softens the soup's spicy heat.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly compelling matches involve the moles made from those
most indigenous of New World ingredients: chiles, chocolate, peanuts,
tomatoes and tomatillos. Mole is to Mexicans as chili is to Texans:
everyone has their own secret family recipe. There are many styles,
as anyone who has visited Oaxaca (its reputed birthplace) will
attest. One major distinguishing characteristic is the proportion of
smoky-flavored ancho or chipotle chiles used. For the less-smoky
versions, old-vine Grenache wines that taste like very fragrant
raspberry jam, such as those from the McLaren Vale district of
Australia, are ideal.</TE>
<TE>   Zinfandels from Amador County in California's Sierra Foothills are
another tasty match. Most impressive, however, for producing an
eye-opening taste sensation is a very smoky dark mole made by Sal
Morales at El Dorado Cantina on San Vicente Boulevard in Brentwood,
matched to the black pepper nuances of a cold-climate Syrah such as
the Rosemount 2000 Orange Vineyard Shiraz. You can also find those
peppery overtones in northern Rhone reds or in California Zinfandels
and Petite Sirahs from cool regions such as the Russian River
district of Sonoma.</TE>
<TE>   Since the classic wine-food traditions of Europe do not supply us
with much guidance  on the subject of spicy cuisine, Southern
California is the logical place for these pairings to be discovered
and popularized. Our great advantage is access to an incredibly broad
range of foodstuffs, wines and cultures, and we should be taking
advantage of this. Research, of course, implies there will be
failures as well as successes. At my house we go ahead and eat them
both, but we do our best to remember how the successes were prepared
so those can be confidently trotted out for an encore.</TE>

<TE>   Mole Recipes from Sal Morales at El Dorado Cantina, Brentwood</TE>
<TE>   Moles can be served with roasted chicken, enchiladas, chiles
rellenos or tamales, to name a few dishes. Additional mole can be
frozen for up to two months.</TE>

<TE>   Black Mole</TE>
<TE>   Makes about 8 cups</TE>
<TE>   1/2 tablespoon butter</TE>
<TE>   1 small white onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   Salt and pepper to taste</TE>
<TE>   2-3 ancho chiles, seeded and toasted</TE>
<TE>   2-3 chiles negros, seeded and toasted</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup toasted almond slices</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup toasted peanuts</TE>
<TE>   1-2 garlic cloves</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup raisins</TE>
<TE>   3 cloves</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound Mexican chocolate</TE>
<TE>   3 roasted tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   4 cups chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons vegetable shortening</TE>
<TE>   Heat butter in a heavy 8-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the
onions and cook, stirring frequently, until they begin to soften,
about 5 minutes. Cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Continue to
cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and golden
brown, 20 minutes longer. Adjust the heat so the onions brown but do
not burn. Add balsamic vinegar, plus salt and pepper to taste, and
cook for an additional minute. Remove from heat and set aside. Put
vegetable shortening and garlic cloves into a stockpot and cook over
medium heat for 5 minutes. Then add remaining ingredients, including
the onions, and simmer for 45 minutes. Allow mixture to cool.
Transfer cooled mixture to a blender and thoroughly puree. Return
mixture to sauce pan and simmer for another five minutes.</TE>

<LD>Some days artist Baron Margo drives the three-wheeled rocket car he
constructed from a motorcycle engine and airplane parts. On other
occasions, he might be tooling around in his custom-shortened,
topless gray 1968 Volkswagen coupe. For this metal-machine visionary,
it's all in a day's work.</LD>
<LD>   For more than 20 years, Margo's palette has been the junk heaps
and shipyards he scours for scrap metal and machine parts that are
reborn as fantastical found-object sculptures. On display in Santa
Monica through Nov. 10 at the Gallery of Functional Art, the
self-taught artist's robots, rockets, clocks and other fabrications
inhabit a universe in which the building blocks of life are copper,
aluminum, brass and stainless steel.</LD>
<TE>   There is the "Universal Pilot" in a plane made from a baby buggy
base and wings from real airplane wingtips. "He has a backpack and is
equipped to fly all over the world," says Margo. Or the "Rocket
Lamp," composed of an old canister vacuum cleaner base and an
aluminum cylinder body. There are boats, submarines and race cars
that light up. Margo's "Big Red Entertainment Center" does hold a TV,
CD and cassette player, but with the door closed it's a robot made
from an old projector arc light and other junk finds. "Atomic Woman"
towers over the other pieces with feet made of street light bases,
fingers of small gas lines and a painted manikin head "robotized"
with wires.</TE>
<TE>   By junior high school during the mid '50s, Margo was building
customized motorbikes, including the "Wizard," which he entered in
the 1955 Motorama car show. "I built it in my bedroom. I tore it
apart, had it all chromed," he says. "I'm not really a drawing
artist, but more of a doer." By high school he had built several
cars. After graduation, he had an old junk store on Fairfax Avenue
that he considered his "college." There he began fabricating
see-through plexiglass radios and other creations. "I took a stand-up
barber pole and put a fish tank with real fish in it on top. I would
build things and put them in the store and sell them," says Margo. He
haunted junkyards, where a single piece often inspired an elaborate
construction. "If I can't find the parts I need, I have them cast at
a foundry, and I've learned to sand-cast myself."</TE>
<TE>   A now-vanished store on Main Street in Santa Monica displayed
pieces by Margo for about 15 years, and his work began to sell. About
20 years ago, "I made a great big 7-foot robot and sold it for a lot
of money. I reinvested it by making more pieces," says Margo, who
works from his Silver Lake home.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the eight large-scale robots Margot has constructed have
sold, but he'd be welding and sanding either way. "What I get from my
work is the reaction when people see it. My goal is to draw an
emotion. Recognition is good, but the main thing is to have enough
money to keep building and creating. I wouldn't trade it for
anything."</TE>

<DH>A Brentwood gardener discovers that variegated plants are
temperamental--but worth the effort</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Heeger</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 15 years Nancy Borun has been growing gold-and-green abutilon,
green-and-white beech, spattered geranium, splashed ivy, striped
bamboo. It hasn't always been easy. Variegated plants, which have
less chlorophyll in their leaves, don't get along with just any
greens, or in just any old setting. They're temperamental: too much
sun, their fetching two-toned leaves may burn; too little, they might
revert to all-green. A cold snap? Some can't take it. Their patterned
stripes and spots can be hard to match, not only with other stripers
but with solid hues that aren't warm enough or dark enough to show
them off.</LD>
<LD>   Yet while other gardeners are just making these discoveries, Borun
is a veteran at moving fussy plants around, changing their food,
their watering schedules, potting them up, unpotting them--anything
to keep them alive. For her, these very challenges make variegated
plants fun. First, she says, there is the novelty: ''Wow, a striped
iris. A ficus with a creamy edge. I didn't know they came that way!''
Then there is the question: ''Can I get that thing to grow?''</LD>
<TE>   In most cases, she can. Festively colored foliages drift through
beds, climb fences and loll from pots on her Brentwood lot, where
every spare inch around her house is dedicated to garden. She gave up
her driveway for plants in 1994, and before that, she claimed her
neighbor's garage wall, covered it with lattice and planted ivy, the
variegated kind, of course. Elsewhere, she grows variegated kumquats,
nasturtiums and columbines. Most of her ferns and two of her redbuds
are etched with white. On close inspection, even the leaves of her
wisteria are gold-flecked. ''It hasn't bloomed,'' she admits. ''After
four years I just feel lucky it's still here. I'm not that interested
in blooms.''</TE>
<TE>   Foliages are what intrigue her, their shapes and tones, their
smooth or fuzzy textures, the way they spark each other, weaving a
scene much richer than its parts.</TE>
<TE>   Borun comes from a gardening family and attributes her leaf
obsession to her mother, Ruth, who has a Brentwood garden too, though
much larger and more elaborate than her daughter's. It was back in
1987 that Borun, staying temporarily with her parents, first became
aware of what she calls ''the nuances of variegation. I'd never seen
the plants my mother had, plants I recognized but knew in their
ordinary green forms.'' Her mother had the first striped iris she'd
ever seen, along with Japanese painted ferns, pelargoniums and
pittosporums, plants that shone, particularly, in shade.</TE>
<TE>   Borun eventually bought her own house and soon afterward began
gardening in the patchy shade of a giant sycamore. Chris Rosmini, the
L.A. garden designer who had laid out her mother's landscape, laid
out Borun's too, creating an English-style front garden and a rear
courtyard with a fountain and beds where any plant that could take
the sycamore's root competition made the cut. Oakleaf hydrangea,
white azalea, red Japanese maple and hellebores survived. Two years
ago, when Borun worked up the nerve to yank the sycamore, she was
finally able to add more tender variegated favorites such as the
columbine and a strap-leafed sisyrinchium. Venice garden designer
Barry Campion created a separate fountain garden to replace the
driveway. Borun then added some favorites of her own, most notably, a
few variegated ficus that form a backdrop for burgundy heucheras and
bronze astilbes in the rear garden.</TE>
<TE>   In general, says Borun, variegated greens, which may have pink or
yellow-green edges, combine beautifully with maroon and chartreuse
plants in either complementary or contrasting schemes. To head off
clashes, she avoids placing patterned plants too close together,
unless their shapes create a striking blend, as in the case of the
sisyrinchium that sprays beside a round-leafed, white-rimmed
pelargonium. She makes liberal use of containers too, so she can
coddle touchy types, like the variegated redbud, and mix plants into
small vignettes that would otherwise be too busy for beds. Pots are
also the place for plants, such as variegated ajuga, that might
otherwise invade each other's space.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure the well-being of her collection, Borun, the mother of
two teenage girls, gardens daily, patrolling for bugs, rubbing aphids
off tender leaves and mixing worm castings into the soil to banish
whitefly. When a plant flags in one spot, as in the case of a
variegated dogwood Ruth gave her, she tries it in another. And she
still goes plant-hunting with her mother, often to Sperling Nursery
in Calabasas, a prime source for splashy greens. ''True, I have no
room,'' Borun concedes. ''My lot is 50 by 100 feet. But then I look
around and think, do I really need that garage?''</TE>

<LD>Think of it as a Zagat Survey for the mosaics, murals, sculptures and
fountains that pepper the city landscape. "Urban Surprises: A Guide
to Public Art in Los Angeles," recently issued with the backing of
the Cultural Affairs Department, lists more than 300 artworks at such
unexpected sites as police stations, a car dealership and a recycling
center.</LD>
<LD>   The slim compendium, published by Glendale-based Balcony Press,
indexes pieces in all corners of the city, from the steel sculpture
of dancing figures in the Sylmar/San Fernando Metrolink station to
oil paintings honoring the fishing industry in a San Pedro bank. Each
numbered entry, cross-referenced to handy maps, lists artist, address
and description. About a dozen glossy color photographs by Dennis
Keeley whet the appetites of potential treasure hunters. "I hope this
is something that people will put in their cars and reference if they
notice something at a stoplight," says editor Gloria Gerace. "Or,
even better, look up where their houses are and explore what's in
their neighborhoods."</LD>
<TE>   Given that L.A. harbors enough public art to fill "10 volumes," as
Gerace puts it, the guide lists only works budgeted into a
construction or renovation project and commissioned by either the
Cultural Affairs Department's Public Art Programs, the Community
Redevelopment Agency's Downtown Art in Public Places or the
Metropolitan Transit Authority's Metro Art Department.</TE>
<TE>   Branch libraries proved to be unexpectedly rewarding public art
repositories, says Gerace, deputy director of administration at the
UCLA Hammer Museum. "We need to relish these gems in our city." At
the Vermont Square location, a sleek glass table sandblasted with the
titles of books banned by schools and libraries ("The Sun Also Rises"
and "The Indian in the Cupboard," for example) gleams amid a sea of
young readers. Across town, the facade of the Robertson outpost is
embellished with quotations on learning from literary visionaries
such as Malcolm X and Maxine Hong Kingston.</TE>
<TE>   Gerace became interested in assembling a public art directory
while on a project with Mark Johnstone, former administrator of
public arts for the Cultural Affairs Department. He and colleague
Roella Hsieh Louie, former director of grants, public arts and
planning, introduced her to the genre's unique ideals. "They seduced
me, not just with the beautiful art itself, but with the process
involved with creating it," Gerace says.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Johnstone's essay for the guide states, "Public art is not
only about a work of art; it is also about the process." In his
vision, a public artist ideally collaborates with community members,
including developers or landscape architects, and gleans history from
citizens to create a piece that helps build and define its site.
"That interaction can help bring the whole community to a different
level of understanding art," Johnstone says. "It allows an exchange
of ideas, which might not be realized in galleries or schools. It's a
really exciting laboratory to work in."</TE>

<HD>Rape, How Funny Is It?</HD>
<DH>Quick Now: What Has 2 Million Victims, Turns Passive Men
Violent, Spreads HIV and Could Be Stopped Overnight? If You Said
'Prison Rape,' You're in on the Joke.</DH>

<LD>Bill Handel is a drive-time radio host on L.A.'s KFI-AM (640). He
stays popular because he has a feel for what makes his audience
chuckle as they head for that unfunny 9 a.m. encounter with the boss.
His repertoire includes prison rape jokes, the tired but reliable
picking-up-soap-in-the-shower ones, especially when the hapless
subject is a celebrated or heinous convict. "When people hear about a
victim" of prison rape, Handel explains, the response is: "So he
should have stayed out of jail!"</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, the chief law enforcement official of
California, told the Wall Street Journal last year that Enron CEO
Kenneth Lay deserved to be jailed with a cellmate who would say to
him, "Hi. My name is Spike, honey."</LD>
<LD>   Everyone, it seems, is in on prison rape jokes. Don't worry about
crossing a line because when the subject is inmates raping other
inmates, people don't empathize. They laugh.</LD>
<TE>   So have you heard this one? The FBI says that 89,107 women
reported rapes in the U.S. in 1999. Prison experts say that at least
twice that number of men are raped each year in prison. "Prison rape
is the most tolerated act of terrorism in the U.S.," says James E.
Robertson, a professor of corrections at Minnesota State University,
Mankato, who has studied the problem for 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Precise numbers of these rapes are not available. Neither the
federal government nor the state of California keep statistics on the
crime. But this much is known: Just as heterosexual rapes across the
U.S. are often not reported, sexual abuse in prison is "massively
underreported," says Terry Kupers of Oakland, a psychiatrist who has
written and edited books on prison conditions. Kupers believes that
more than one-third of all incoming inmates in American jails and
prisons are either sexually assaulted or are in imminent danger of
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Struckman-Johnson, a psychology professor at the University
of South Dakota, says that studies she has conducted suggest that at
least 22% of the some 2 million male prisoners nationwide have been
either pressured or forced to submit to sex at least once. Stop
Prisoner Rape, an organization co-founded by Stephen Donaldson, a
Vietnam veteran who was raped repeatedly after being jailed for
protesting the Vietnam War, argues that one prisoner in five has been
sexually abused and that one in 10 has been raped.</TE>
<TE>   Yet most Americans accept prison rape as a harsh reality, and
their jokes imply that the victims are getting their just reward.
"The only people who care are the relatives, and they are usually
poor and uneducated," explains Cal Skinner Jr., a conservative
Republican who fought for state prison reform during eight terms in
the Illinois Legislature. Skinner eventually paid a high price for
his activism when he lost a reelection bid to an opponent who mocked
his efforts to end prison rape. But he and others continue to work
against the abuses. Their findings won't set up many punch lines.</TE>
<TE>   The victims often haven't been convicted of crimes, Kupers says.
Many prison rapes happen in poorly supervised local jails to
short-time prisoners who are found innocent or sometimes not even
charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those who have been convicted are serving time for
nonviolent offenses. But to survive behind bars, they are forced to
adapt to the culture of brutality, says Vincent Schiraldi, president
of the Justice Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. Many have trouble
leaving it behind once set free. "Prisons have a far better chance of
turning a nonviolent inmate into an armed robber than into a
law-abiding citizen," Schiraldi says.</TE>
<TE>   Worse still is Skinner's ominous warning that research conducted
by his legislative staff found an alarming amount of HIV among
prisoners. "Prison systems in many states are a major breeding
grounds for the AIDS virus, and that can give rape victims an
unadjudicated death sentence. How can society live with that?"</TE>
<TE>   Seven years ago, Lawrence Bittenbender was held temporarily in the
Santa Clara County jail in San Jose awaiting extradition to the state
of Washington to serve time for child molestation, a conviction to
which he protests his innocence and blames his ex-wife for a false
accusation. He was placed in a dormitory that housed 28 men. At 2
a.m., he was jumped by five inmates who, he believes, had been told
by guards of the nature of the charge against him. He says he was
awakened by a blanket thrown over his head and the bodies of several
men piling on top. He was forced to endure at least a half-hour of
rape.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea it was coming," he says. "All of a sudden, I
couldn't breathe. Someone grabbed at my clothes. Someone thumped my
head." The raping "was excruciating, pain that seemed to go on
forever. There was blood everywhere." He says he required surgery to
repair the damage to his sphincter muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Bittenbender, now 46, is serving time in McNeil Island Corrections
Center in Washington. He is bitter and angry, a powerful man ready to
use his strength and rage without hesitation. He never stops being
watchful and pumps iron preparing for the day of the next attack. "I
know how to take care of myself now. If someone tries it again, no
matter how long his sentence is, he'll be free in the morning. I'll
take a lot of damage, and I'll kill him." To prove his resolve, he
goes to great lengths to explain an ingenious way that a "shiv"
(homemade knife) can be made out of everyday materials.</TE>
<TE>   The state of California knows that violent sexual assaults are
common, but refuses to take meaningful steps to prevent them, says a
high-ranking official with the Department of Corrections who asked
that his name be withheld. Prison rape "is not treated as a problem,"
he says. "We don't do anywhere near all we could to prevent it."</TE>
<TE>   California corrections officials say they have no idea how many
rapes occur in their prisons, although Brian Parry, a corrections
assistant director who recently retired, says, "In terms of numbers,
I don't see it as a big problem. It doesn't get reported very
frequently."</TE>
<TE>   Others in the department disagree. They see rape as a cancer that
corrections does not fight aggressively because acknowledging its
extent would make the department look bad and make the state more
vulnerable to lawsuits, the high-ranking official says. It would also
remove a tool that many prison guards use to control prisoners,
Robertson says. "There's an implicit quid pro quo between some
officers and gangs, as well as the more aggressive inmates: You keep
the lid on and we'll leave you alone."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Wright, 37, is editor of Prison Legal News, a monthly
newspaper, while serving time at Monroe Correctional Complex in
Washington for the botched robbery-murder of a drug dealer in 1987.
He has never been attacked in prison because, he says, "I was older,
bigger and could defend myself." But he became aware of the problem
while confined. "We'd be watching television, and you know how you
get to a silent part of a movie? We'd hear prisoners screaming for
help: 'Guard, guard, help! I'm being raped!' and guards wouldn't
respond."</TE>
<TE>   The issue briefly flared into prominence in California in 1998,
when four guards at Corcoran State Prison near Fresno stood trial on
the criminal charge that they had used rape as a disciplinary tool by
allowing a sinister inmate called the "Booty Bandit" to rape an L.A.
gang member named Eddie Dillard repeatedly. The four were acquitted.
Even so, says the corrections official, some guards allow rapes to go
on. "Absolutely. It's a mentality and ego thing [among guards] who
think, 'I'm God and I have the power.' "</TE>
<TE>   William Rigg, a retired lieutenant in the California Department of
Corrections, says the prison system simply regards rapes with
indifference. "They just don't care, from the C.O.s [correctional
officers] all the way up to the director of corrections. The
governor, to him the CDC is a pain in the butt. The less he hears
about it, the happier he is."</TE>
<TE>   The powerful union that represents prison guards, the California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn., does not see inmate sexual assault
as a problem. Lance Corcoran, executive vice president and a former
guard, says offenses may be "underreported," but he believes that
most occasions of sexual contact are consensual. He says it is
"nonsense" to claim that some guards conspire to use sexual assault
as a tool of manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Roscoe Pondexter of Fresno, who served as a guard for eight years
in Soledad and Corcoran prisons before resigning in 1996, says he
personally reported to superiors five inmate complaints of sexual
assault. "They weren't taken seriously," he says. "There was no great
effort to substantiate them."</TE>
<TE>   Pondexter says that, typically, victims tend to be troublemakers,
child molesters and rapists, the very people whom guards do not find
sympathetic. He says guards feel that such victims "got what they
deserved. They did it to someone on the streets, so now someone is
doing it to them."</TE>
<TE>   People on the outside blink in bewilderment at the idea of one man
raping another. The confusion begins with any notion that these are
typical homosexual activities. Technically, that may be true, but the
term is not valid in the eyes of the most important definers--the
prisoners. As in heterosexual rapes, primary motivations are an
intermingling of power, domination and anger. It is accepted dogma in
prison that rapists are not homosexuals, says Chuck Terry, 50, an
assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at St. Louis
University who served time in California and Oregon prisons for
heroin use. The distinction allows predators to masquerade their
activities as super-masculine.</TE>
<TE>   Convicted rapists and child molesters are always targets of prison
rapists, but also at grave risk are inmates who are young and naive,
short-termers, or those who are effeminate in appearance or manner
and not aggressive in defending themselves. Their attackers are
generally gang members in for long-term violent offenses.</TE>
<TE>   A former sex criminal, who asked not to be identified, describes
how it "goes down," as though relating a trip to the grocery store.
Since his release from California's Chuckawalla Valley State Prison,
he has become a drug dealer in Southern California and, his
acquaintances say, is almost certainly a murderer.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest man, strongest man [in prison] was a friend of mine,
Bo, from Washington, D.C.," the former inmate says. "He raped about
20 men. He had a fetish. On the outside, he raped women for a hobby.
That's why he ended up there. But when he got into the penitentiary,
a man was a desired thing for him. I helped him set up men and I
would partake also. He was a good friend, but if he didn't like you,
he'd rape you before he killed you.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to sic Bo on a lot of men. White, black, Mexican. For all
kinds of reasons. Maybe someone [would] be sitting here and not get
up fast enough. We rolled with the Black Guerrilla Family, part of
the nationwide penitentiary circuit." As for homosexuals or men with
light skin, "they'd be raped all the time. Once you turned 'em, they
gonna be women from then on. Aryan Nation did their own people, too.
If we had one who didn't have any backbone, we might trade him to
them for a favor and they'd do the same."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Hogshire, 44, is a writer who has looked at bars from the
wrong direction. He is the author of "You're Going to Prison," a
primer on the criminal justice system. "Prison is a deadly place
occupied by weird guys who are usually not very bright, who are very
aggressive and often sociopathic," Hogshire says. "These are guys who
in the free world, if they can't get an online computer hook-up, they
go berserk. Cutting in front of them in the chow line is something
huge. It's like being transplanted back to the Middle Ages. Once you
understand that, you can accept that rape is an extremely common
occurrence, and anyone not morbidly obese or covered with sores faces
the likelihood of having to submit to sexual assault."</TE>
<TE>   He says the most vulnerable will be beaten and raped as often as
necessary until they seek help from an "old man," a predator who will
give protection but will also make sexual demands. "Once you've
become someone's punk, you stay a punk and your old man will use you
any way he wants. He might send you out to perform sexual acts for a
marijuana joint, candy or anything else of value. You have become
'currency.' "</TE>
<TE>   Male victims of prison rape very likely will react to the trauma
of rape with similar emotions as female victims: shock, anger, guilt
and humiliation, says Lara Stemple, executive director of Stop
Prisoner Rape, which is based in Los Angeles. These feelings are
intensified if they are raped repeatedly, which sometimes occurs for
years. They also feel deep shame at being unable to defend
themselves, and that failure destroys their sense of manhood, she
says.</TE>
<TE>   There is a perception that prison rapists are black and victims
white, but many who have observed it say this is an
oversimplification. However, most California prison
confrontations--whether over gambling, drugs, sex or debts--do end up
being played out along racial lines. Race is the prison fault line.
Often, whites fit the prey profile more than blacks or Latinos
because they commonly lack street smarts, and a higher proportion are
in for nonviolent drug or white-collar crimes. "Race is a factor to
the extent that whatever race is predominant, they tend to victimize
the minority," Wright says. "It comes down to the pool of prey versus
the pool of predators, and whites aren't organized to protect each
other and can be more easily picked off one by one."</TE>
<TE>   The international organization Human Rights Watch is less sanguine
on the subject. Its four-year study, called "No Escape" and released
last year, concluded that "white inmates are disproportionately
targeted for abuse." The report noncommittally cites two common
theories for this: greater violence in the black criminal subculture
and payback for past racial abuses.</TE>
<TE>   Women prisoners are also not immune from sexual attack, but it
almost always comes from male guards. The numbers are far fewer, but
it is an egregious offense that has received greater public
attention. Some who study male rape are critical of what they see as
the lack of support from women's rape groups in focusing attention on
the problem. "It's just not on the radar screen for anti-rape
activists," Wright says. "Rape of men is about where rape of women
was 50 years ago in terms of how the public sees it. So victims 'deal
with it' and cover it up."</TE>
<TE>   "Put it this way," Vincent Schiraldi says: "You're a women's group
waging war on rapists--rapists are men! It's tough to retool,
psychologically and organizationally, and expand your outreach. But
this might change as the problem becomes better known."</TE>
<TE>   Prison authorities often fall back on the theory that most prison
sex is consensual--even though there are not enough homosexual men in
prison to support the number of incidents. Additionally, since the
range of coercion extends from brutal force to providing "protection"
in exchange for exclusive sex, it is difficult to sort things out.
Presumably because of that, and because of the fear of AIDS,
California prisons officially prohibit all sexual contact between
prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Prisoners nearing the end of their sentences are especially at
risk because they fear having their term extended by fighting back.
They just want to be left alone to serve their time, but they rarely
are. Still, they keep their secrets to themselves. Jim Hogshire
explains it by putting himself in the mind of a victim: "OK, I've
gotta do this [endure rape], but I'm not telling anyone on the
outside. And when I get out, I'll put it behind me.</TE>
<TE>   "To them, the humiliation and hell of being punked-out is not as
bad as getting a lifetime sentence for killing someone or even being
killed," Hogshire continues. "It's an awful choice, but it's the only
choice some guys get. And the choice is final. Many just kill
themselves. Those who live and are released reenter society every bit
as [screwed up] as you might expect."</TE>
<TE>   The public also has another reason to fear the mental state of
prison rape victims who have served their sentences. Many of them are
carrying sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. Prison
officials are aware that the combination of sexual assault and the
rapid rise of these diseases creates a lethal mix in prisons, but
many choose to ignore the problem, says Robert Dumond, a former
mental health director with the Massachusetts penal system. As a case
in point, he says that virtually no data has been collected
nationally showing the extent of infection arising from sexual
assault, though "everyone knows it happens commonly."</TE>
<TE>   Citing budget woes, the California Department of Corrections does
not, as a rule, give blood tests to new inmates. The department,
therefore, has no idea how many inmates have undetected HIV/AIDS or
hepatitis, although an earlier state study indicated that about
one-third of all new convicts have either hepatitis B or C. The
corrections department says it does know that 20,434 inmates have
hepatitis B or C; 742 have HIV and another 582 have full-blown AIDS,
up from 157 in 1999. All of these sick inmates are housed in the
general population. "We don't isolate because there is little risk of
infection except through blood or bodily fluids," a spokesman says.</TE>
<TE>   Told of this practice, Dumond responds with a long, mirthless
laugh. "That's unbelievable," he says. "No, that's frightening."
Dumond now serves as a consultant to Stop Prisoner Rape, the
organization co-founded by Stephen Donaldson. Years after being raped
while jailed for his war protest, Donaldson was imprisoned again,
this time for threatening medical personnel who refused to treat a
hand he had injured. Donaldson was raped again--and caught the AIDS
virus, which killed him after his release.</TE>
<TE>   Is there anything that prisons can do day-to-day to diminish this
predation? Hogshire believes so. He says, with some hyperbole, "They
could stop this stuff tomorrow morning. If they sent perpetrators to
Pelican Bay [an ultra-maximum-security prison] where they could spend
their days in isolation, and if they also transferred their victims
to other institutions without the snitch rap in their files [so it
could not be learned later that they were informers], they would be
scaring the hell out of would-be rapists and, at the same time,
telling their victims that speaking up wouldn't mean a shiv in the
back."</TE>
<TE>   William Rigg believes that the number of incidents can be greatly
reduced by prompt administrative action when a rapist is identified.
"Single cell and walk alone," he says, meaning that contact with
other inmates is minimized or eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Haney is a psychology professor at UC Santa Cruz who has
studied prison life. He says that one tool prison officials could use
is conjugal visits, which are now barred in California prisons for
inmates serving life sentences. He believes that such privileges
would release pent-up sexual pressures and allow officials
give-and-take-away leverage with inmates.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal laws also would help, although finding
legislators to champion the cause is nearly hopeless.
"Prisoner-rights issues are dogs when it comes to legislation,"
Schiraldi says. "Helping inmates is nuclear waste, politically."</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Cal Skinner, the former Illinois legislator who pushed
for prison reforms. His opponent in the 2000 primary election accused
him of being more interested in convicts than in constituents, and he
was defeated. Skinner says his greatest frustration, however, was his
inability to push through effective laws aimed at stopping prison
rape in Illinois. That result is mirrored in other states where
legislation also generally fails, he says. "There's no lobbyist
crusading against prison rape. For a lawmaker, it's a mission without
political reward."</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento is silent on the issue. An official with the California
Senate's Public Safety Committee, who asked not to be identified,
says that he can't recall any bills introduced on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   Congress is considering action against rape in the form of "The
Prison Rape Reduction Act," which has strong bipartisan support.
Whether President Bush signs it into law or not is still an open
question. The bill, which applies to both state and federal prisons,
requires the Justice Department to create a clearinghouse for
statistics on prison rape nationwide, ties federal funding for
prisons to levels of rape occurrences, provides a hotline for victims
and creates a training program for corrections officials. It's not
exactly a Magna Carta on the subject, but, as Schiraldi says, "It's a
start."</TE>
<TE>   When prison rapes occur, responsibility for prosecuting
perpetrators falls on local district attorneys. The problem is,
Schiraldi says, that D.A.s are often loath to file charges because
those prosecutions could be seen as coming to the defense of
criminals. And in most jurisdictions, spending local tax money to
protect criminals, even if they're victims, becomes a politically
risky act.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the main hope for convicts who believe they have
been wronged has always been the courts. However, because inmates
often have to serve as their own attorneys, the barriers are high,
James Robertson says. For an inmate to prove a violation of the 8th
Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment, for example, he must
show that the prison staff practiced deliberate indifference, which
is exceedingly difficult. Historically, inmates file lawsuits in
federal courts because they distrust state courts. However, the
federal Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 makes it much more
difficult to prevail in federal court, often leaving inmates feeling
as if they have no place to go for legal protection.</TE>
<TE>   Forcing prisoners to seek shelter from "cruel and unusual
punishment" at the hands of other prisoners is itself an indictment
of the American justice system, Vincent Schiraldi says. Or, as the
Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky said more pointedly in "The House of
the Dead," a novel based upon the four years he served for sedition
in Russia's abysmal 19th century prisons: The degree to which a
society is civilized can be judged by entering its prisons.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>INVITED TO: "Special screening party" for Warner Bros.' "Ghost Ship"
at the Orpheum Theater, with after party at the Downtown L.A.
Standard.</LD>
<LD>   WHICH WAY IS UP? "We like to do something weird and creepy around
Halloween," announces Joel Silver, who, with fellow producer Robert
Zemeckis, introduces Warner's -"The Shining"-esque tale of a haunted
ocean liner. After a few tittery frights amid the 1926 Orpheum's
movie palace splendor, the crowd removes to the monolithic cool of
the Standard hotel, where the real adventure begins. Tonight hotelier
Andre Balazs' retro-outfitted playground in a former gray-flannel-era
office building is feeling like a neon-lit, right-side-up version of
"The Poseidon Adventure." Owing to poor crowd capacity logistics
(i.e., the fire marhsal's here), knots of celebrities are trying
unorthodox routes to the rooftop bar-pool-lounge. Lisa Ling is
blocked at the back elevator before she can take in the view. Mark
McGrath confronts the impasse at the escalator. "You had to go
through one area to get to another area and, believe it or not, we
plowed through security," says the Sugar Ray lead man, emerging
topside. "It was ridiculous, but Mudvayne is playing, so you expect
nothing less."</LD>
<TE>   KEEPING IT REAL: "I came for Mudvayne; no one else cares to listen
to good music," declares dapper rocker spawn Jack Osbourne, looking
comfortably at home. And why shouldn't he feel at home? As is often
the case chez Osbourne, wandering MTV film crews are recording
everything, in this instance, for a production called "Party on the
Ghost Ship." Could Jack be on to something, music-wise? Indeed, the
non-MTV contingent, including Lara Flynn Boyle and Jessica Capshaw as
well as "Page Six" fixture Paris Hilton, seems less than motivated by
the movie's featured soundtrack artists, ghoul rocker combo Mudvayne.
"I've never heard of the Mudvaynes," admits Rachael Leigh Cook,
bundled up for autumn in a brown wool herringbone overcoat. "They're
a metal band, right?" asks Luke Wilson, scouting the rooftop for his
friends and brother Owen. Brittany Murphy's interest appears directed
at "That '70s Show's" Ashton Kutcher, while fellow cast member Danny
Masterson is just happy to be here. "This is my favorite bar in
L.A.," he says. "Beautiful outdoors and you can smoke everywhere. I
come here even on off nights--an 'on' night is kind of a bonus."</TE>
<TE>   Celeb Quotient: ***</TE>

getting there halves the fun.</TE>

<LD>The idea of honey-voiced '70s pop icon Richard Carpenter owning a
spiked truncheon seems unfathomable. Yet such an object is on display
at the Carpenters Exhibit in the lobby of the Richard and Karen
Carpenter Performing Arts Center at Cal State Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   This puzzling item was actually a gag gift offered by the manager
of the brother-and-sister band on the assumption that Richard would
attract so many crazed female admirers he'd need to "beat them off
with a stick." (Curatorial signage dryly states, "It was never
used.") The memorabilia collection was installed at fan request six
years after the 1994 opening of the center, which was built with an
endowment from the Carpenter family to the school where the siblings
sang in choir.</LD>
<TE>   Peter Lesnik, executive director of the center, notes that the
Carpenters' following remains strong in England, Australia and Japan,
and that visitors come from overseas to admire these pop relics.
Pilgrims can pay homage to gold records, trophies, Richard's
Wurlitzer 140-B electric piano and Karen's 1965 Ludwig Super Classic
drum set. On the piano is the original lead sheet for "(They Long to
Be) Close to You." A video includes clips from a visit to Nixon's
White House and shots of the Carpenters' "Brady Bunch"-era home in
Downey. Evident are the pair's sartorial evolution, from hippified
granny-wear to '70s coordinates, and troubling frailty in Karen, who
died at 32 in 1983 from heart failure caused by anorexia.</TE>
<TE>   Lesnik admits there's a melancholy aspect to the band's story, but
adds, "There was that quality to Karen's voice--a haunting quality.
Their songs weren't all cheery bright lovey-love songs," he says.
"There was a lot of depth." A Carpenters expert by default, Lesnik
works near the endlessly looping video with its wall-to-wall sound, a
saturation-level presence that could make even an ardent fan reach
for Richard's spiked club. But, then again, these are the gentle
sounds of the Carpenters. "I never get tired of it," Lesnik insists.
"I never do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Carpenters Exhibit, Carpenter Center (6200 Atherton St., Long
Beach), is open to the public the first Saturday of each month, 10
a.m. to noon. Free. Visitors are encouraged to call in advance, (562)
985-4274.</TE>

<LD>Dogtown's Z-Boys launched a cultural revolution during the 1970s,
shredding the streets of Venice and Santa Monica and founding a
skate-punk nation in Southern California's drought-drained backyard
pools. One of the more improbable consequences of their hard-core,
DIY ethos is the rise of the man skirt. Steven Villegas, a
Seattle-based fashion revolutionary who grew up sidewalk surfing in
Dogtown during the Z-Boys era, has never let go of the anti-corporate
punk rock ethos of his childhood. Since the spring of 2000, Villegas'
revolutionary vehicle has been the Utilikilt, his ultra-burly skirt
for men. His inspiration? A yearning for comfort, freedom and
liberation not to be found in bifurcated garments--er, trousers.
"It's like getting the fullest utility out of your hardest-working
pants and wearing a towel," says Villegas.</LD>
<LD>   Three years ago Villegas had a union gig painting ferries and
submarines and dreamed of designing the ultimate male utilitarian
garment. When he almost lost a finger on the job, he used the down
time to fabricate the first Utilikilt, an indestructible knee-length
kilt with cargo pockets, from a pair of commando pants.</LD>
<TE>   The garment caught the eyes of a 300-pound Seattle bouncer, and
Villegas had his first customer. Relying exclusively on word of mouth
for advertising, Utilikilts has since grown into an eco- and
labor-conscious company with 15 employees working in a
4,000-square-foot retail store and work space in Seattle, where all
Utilikilts are made. "We're more of a social phenomenon than a
fashion statement," Villegas says. "It's more about social and
cultural freedom and change."</TE>
<TE>   The kilt comes in five styles, in heavy-duty materials including
12-ounce duck cloth and military grade rivets, and ranges from $110
for the original style to a $550 tuxedo kilt. Customers typically
wait six to eight weeks for the handmade garments. "A lot of people
who buy Utilikilts are strong leaders, pioneers in their fields,"
Villegas says of such kilt wearers as "The Other Half" co-hosts Mario
Lopez, Dick Clark and Danny Bonaduce; members of the Irish band
Brother; and members of the punk rock band Tomato Head. "They're not
afraid of their sexuality."</TE>

<HD>Packing for a trip: When in doubt, leave it out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arthur Frommer</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've written about packing for travel on countless occasions. But the
advice is so essential that it must be repeated. More trips have been
ruined by overpacking than by all the hurricanes, overbooking and
surly waiters of the world combined.</LD>
<LD>   Except on a cruise (which involves different considerations), it
is important that you pack light. Take no more than one medium-size
suitcase per person, partly empty, and you will ensure the success of
your trip. Take more, and you become a fatigued beast of burden.</LD>
<LD>   It's also important to realize that you probably will not be
invited to a garden party, to the opera or to meet the queen while on
your trip, and that it is not necessary to include an outfit for
every occasion. Nor is it necessary to take pharmaceuticals, Kleenex
or Band-Aids; even Katmandu has a 24-hour drugstore.</LD>
<TE>   I've seen tourists arrive at London's Heathrow airport with an
extra suitcase packed with bandages, iodine, toilet paper, lotions
and shampoo. London! The birthplace of the pharmacy. The only
paraphernalia you will need is transformers for your electrical
devices (like hair dryers) or adapters for foreign sockets.</TE>
<TE>   A light suitcase means freedom. To emerge from a train or plane
with bundles in each hand means porters and taxicabs; it means that
the first hotel you pass must be the hotel in which you'll stay. With
a light load, you can walk out when the desk clerk quotes too high a
price.</TE>
<TE>   A light suitcase means you can concentrate on the attractions and
activities of your destination rather than spending hours unpacking
and repacking in the hotel room.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, too, that problems increase as the journey continues.
However heavy your suitcase might have been when you left home, it'll
get twice as heavy as you go along. At every stop of your trip,
you'll pick up mementos, gifts, books, papers, tapes, souvenirs.
Unless your suitcase was one-third empty to begin with, you'll be
festooned with extra parcels and packages near the end.</TE>
<TE>   Make the right decisions and buy the lightest good-quality
suitcase available. Fill it with the skimpiest set of clothing your
courage will allow. Then remove half these clothes from the suitcase
and depart on your trip.</TE>

<KH>Destination: South Carolina</KH>
<HD>Into Charleston's storied past</HD>
<DH>Taking a literary walk in the city's historic district is
like reading an atmospheric Southern novel, except that you get to
see the scenes, not just imagine them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emilie C. Harting</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Charleston, S.C.</DL>
<LD>"This is the writers' city, isn't it? You know, that novel 'Midnight
in the Garden of Good and Evil,' " whispered the woman standing next
to me. She had just stepped off the bus at Charleston Place, the
departure and arrival point for many tours of this evocative Old
South port.</LD>
<LD>   "That's Savannah," I said, correcting her. "We're in Charleston.
But this is also a writers' city.</LD>
<LD>   "Walking around the historic district is like reading a Southern
novel," I told the woman. "Scenes from stories and writers' lives
keep popping out at you."</LD>
<TE>   My husband, Rob, and I were about to take a literary walk I'd
mapped out with the help of history books on the city. We would make
a loop roughly south on Church Street, amble around the waterfront to
the Battery, then proceed back up Meeting Street to the center of
town. (It's generally the same route you take on other city tours.)</TE>
<TE>   We were on a January vacation to the Low Country, as this coastal
area of southeast South Carolina is called. Because I search out
writers' homes wherever I travel, I wanted to explore the literary
side of this bewitching city.</TE>
<TE>   Charleston sits on a peninsula between the Ashley and Cooper
rivers. Once you enter the historic district at the tip, there is
little need for a car.</TE>
<TE>   The historic sites, restaurants and Low Country music places are
within a 10-by-10-block area. Tour buses are not allowed in the
district, but there is ample public transportation, carriage rides
are popular and there are taxis if your feet get tired.</TE>
<TE>   Home of 'Porgy and Bess'</TE>
<TE>   The tourist disappeared before I could tell her about the Southern
Literary Tradition, a bookshop open by appointment only in the
historic Nicholas Trott house.</TE>
<TE>   The moment we entered the house on Cumberland Street, it was clear
that Charleston and the surrounding area had a rich literary history.
Photographs of writers from the 11 Southern states gazed out at us
from the shelves: a beguiling Carson McCullers; a cigarette-puffing
Lillian Hellman; a natty Truman Capote; and a demure Gail Godwin.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of a tour through rooms filled with books dating back
three centuries, owner Trudy Evans served us tea. She explained that
writers and artists have always gravitated toward Charleston, with
its theater, music, art and a reputation as one of the most refined
cities in the South.</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary writers Bret Lott ("Jewel," "The Hunt Club") and
Josephine Humphreys live in the immediate area, Evans said, and Pat
Conroy is a South Carolinian. All three speak often about the
importance of the city to them, and their writings describe the
savannas and sweeping beaches.</TE>
<TE>   For example, "The Hunt Club," full of intrigue, is set in a men's
hunting club that actually exists in eerie dark swamps nearby. The
movie version of "Rich in Love," the well-received novel by
Humphreys, was filmed here. And Sinclair Lewis, Henry James and
Hellman often came for weeks at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Because Charleston was not damaged during the Civil War, layers of
architecture date back more than three centuries. Houses on many
streets were built with their sides facing the street, so as you pass
by you can peek through wrought-iron gates to elaborate frontyard
gardens that bloom all year but are most radiant in spring.</TE>
<TE>   On Church Street we stood across from the Dock Street Theater, a
brown stone building with light blue wrought-iron trim. As a
Northerner I was intrigued that Charleston, without Puritans to
squelch the arts, has had continuous theater since the early 1700s.
The original Dock Street Theater was built in 1735 and stood a few
blocks away. But even more surprising was that opera was performed in
Charleston in 1685.</TE>
<TE>   Farther down Church Street we came to the gray, West Indian-style
buildings that were the inspiration for Dubose Heyward's novel
"Porgy," which became the George Gershwin musical "Porgy and Bess."</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Smalls, a Charleston character who is thought to be the
inspiration for the Porgy character, may have lived in these
buildings. Until World War II, much of the historic district -- now
upscale and beautifully restored -- was run-down; those gray
structures would have been tenements with noisy courtyards like the
one in the musical.</TE>
<TE>   The block got the name Cabbage Row because residents had
vegetables for sale on their windowsills; in the novel and musical,
Heyward called it Catfish Row.</TE>
<TE>   We toured the imposing Heyward-Washington House next door -- this
was a district where white aristocrats and poor blacks lived side by
side after the Civil War -- partly because it is one of the most
noteworthy historic houses in Charleston, with early 18th century
furniture and original outbuildings, including a separate kitchen
house with slave quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Heyward, the original owner and great-great-grandfather of
Dubose Heyward, was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and
one of the many wealthy plantation owners who lived in Charleston.</TE>
<TE>   But what caught my imagination was the upstairs drawing room, said
to be the inspiration for a scene where the black residents of
Catfish Row take shelter during a hurricane in "Porgy." (Dubose
Heyward himself never lived in the mansion.)</TE>
<TE>   The turbulent scene came back to me as I stood in the elegantly
decorated room, with its fine antiques and polished pine floors. The
house has another literary association: The Grimke sisters,
abolitionist writers who wrote a book encouraging Southerners to free
their slaves, lived here as youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   An Edgar Allan Poe connection</TE>
<TE>   At the Battery, the southern tip of the city surrounded on three
sides by water, we were struck by the strong presence of the Villa
Marguerita, a white Italian Renaissance Revival mansion with large
pillars. It was a favorite hotel of writers in the 1920s and '30s --
it had an indoor swimming pool and was a convenient spot to sojourn
on the way to and from Florida. Hellman stayed here, as did Gertrude
Stein and Lewis, who finished "Main Street" in an upstairs room.</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner, at 52 Meeting St., we found the tiny white
one-story building that had been the office of Edmund Ravenel, a
world-famous conchologist (that is, seashell specialist) said to be
the model for William Legrand in Edgar Allan Poe's story "The Gold
Bug." Poe and Ravenel became friends when Poe was stationed at Ft.
Moultrie, and Ravenel had an offshore hut on Sullivan's Island where
he studied sea life.</TE>
<TE>   In the tale, Legrand is an elderly man who discovers a new
specimen, the "gold bug," and leads a boy on a terrifying hunt for
treasure.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravenel office is minuscule next to the adjacent Calhoun
Mansion, a rambling redbrick house thought to have been an early
inspiration for Margaret Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind," set in
Atlanta. Some sources say Mitchell visited the house as a girl when
she came to Charleston to see her grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   The furnishings in the Calhoun Mansion are not the same as they
were when the young Mitchell would have visited the mansion in the
early 1900s. But I couldn't help feeling that she might have been
influenced by the sweeping dark-wood staircase that goes up four
flights to a 75-foot domed ceiling with stained-glass windows by
Louis Tiffany.</TE>
<TE>   Start of a live poets' society</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina Hall, a classic Colonial mansion, has four large
pillars that come to the edge of the curb on Meeting Street. (The
guide on an architectural tour earlier in our weeklong stay explained
that, no, the road hadn't been widened; pillars were often flush with
the street so that carriages could drop off passengers in an area
protected from the weather.)</TE>
<TE>   The Poetry Society of South Carolina, co-founded by Heyward as the
first regional poetry circle in America, had its meetings here for
many years. Jean Toomer, the African American author of the novel
"Cane," was voted in as a member in absentia, and Carl Sandburg and
Amy Lowell read here in the early 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   Farther along on our walk, we stood across from 38 Chalmers St., a
redbrick Colonial, so that we could see the front door.</TE>
<TE>   During the Literary Renaissance of the 1920s and '30s, when there
was a blossoming of the arts, it was a regular meeting place for
writers, and it has been compared to Stein's salon in Paris.
McCullers, Stein, Lewis and James were said to have attended, besides
locals Elizabeth Verner and Josephine Pinckney, a neighbor who was
one of the first to write about African American life in the outlying
Low Country.</TE>
<TE>   One evening near the end of our stay we took "Anna's Ghost Tour,"
one of many tours listed in a Charleston tourism bureau booklet, and
found that Anna Taylor Blythe occasionally does literary walks.</TE>
<TE>   Blythe is a fifth-generation Charlestonian with a depth of
knowledge about local history and legend who has written a book based
on stories she heard as a child.</TE>
<TE>   We took her literary walk early on the morning of our departure
and were her only clients (it was raining). Blythe pointed out the
houses of many local authors, told colorful anecdotes and gave
dramatic readings from prose and poetry about Charleston.</TE>
<TE>   When we passed 38 Chalmers St., now a private residence, she gave
a racier rendition of the literary soirees than I had found in books.
("This one was having an affair with that one, and then that one was
having an affair with her sister. And liquor flowed even though it
was Prohibition.")</TE>
<TE>   As we walked toward the river on a street where Civil War diarist
Mary Boykin Chesnut often stayed, Blythe read us a number of passages
on slavery from Chesnut's book, on which Ken Burns relied heavily for
his TV documentary on the war.</TE>
<TE>   When we came to the multicolored former merchant houses on East
Bay Street, a strip of connected waterfront buildings often referred
to as Rainbow Row, she pointed out Nos. 99-101, which were used for
the film production of "Porgy and Bess."</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the tour, Blythe led us into the Dock Street
Theater and explained how it had been built up from the courtyard of
the old Planters Ho- tel.</TE>
<TE>   "We had theater going here while your Peter Stuyvesant was still
trying to settle Manhattan," she told her Yankee clients with a
chuckle.</TE>

<LD>Generations of writers have been inspired by the sweeping beaches and
savannas of Charleston and the Low Country. Others have been drawn by
the city's arts community and the architecture of its restored
historic district.</LD>
<LD>   A sampling:</LD>
<LD>   Dubose Heyward: A Charleston native, Heyward drew on his
fascination with his city's history and the Gullah culture in writing
"Porgy," the story of a Catfish Row beggar. With his wife, Dorothy,
he wrote a dramatization of the novel, which George Gershwin made
into "Porgy and Bess."</LD>
<TE>   Edgar Allan Poe: The 19th century master of the macabre is thought
to have modeled the moody William Legrand from "The Gold Bug" on
seashell expert Edmund Ravenel, a Charleston resident whom he
befriended.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Mitchell: The rambling Italianate Calhoun Mansion may
have inspired "Gone With the Wind." Some say a young Mitchell visited
the redbrick house when she came to Charleston to visit with her
grandmother.</TE>

<HD>There's a great voyage with your name on it</HD>

<AU>Harry Basch</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes I get so caught up with new ships, mergers, bankruptcies
and other changes in the cruise industry that I tend to forget what
keeps the cruise world afloat: the passenger.</LD>
<LD>   As cruise lines expand, they face the problem of finding more
passengers to fill berths. They have to recruit new cruisers who may
not have thought about vacationing aboard a ship.</LD>
<LD>   Today's big ships have taken steps to deal with first-timers'
basic fears: boredom, seasickness, gaining weight and the possibility
of being stuck on a vacation they will not enjoy.</LD>
<TE>   Ships today offer plenty of options and activities to keep boredom
at bay, and most are big enough to ride steady in the heaviest seas
(or you can book a cruise that stays in calm waters, such as Alaska's
Inside Passage, or that plies rivers). Luxurious shipboard spas, gyms
and exercise activities, along with special low-fat, low-calorie
menus, can keep you trim, and if you don't like your cruise, some
lines, Carnival for one, allow you to disembark at the first port of
call and get a refund for the rest of your fare.</TE>
<TE>   But the best way to ensure that you'll have a happy cruise is to
select the right one. Here are 10 questions to ask yourself before
you book a cruise.</TE>
<TE>   What are you looking for? Sunny beaches, duty-free shopping, a
stress-free, do-nothing getaway, a razzle-dazzle good time with
plenty of entertainment?</TE>
<TE>   You can get them all, but not always on the same ship. A working
couple with young children might choose a family cruise combined with
a Disney World package. A grade-school teacher seeking a break from
work might want to set sail on a ship geared for adults. Know what
you want.</TE>
<TE>   How long can you vacation?</TE>
<TE>   Itineraries can last three, seven, 14 or, for world cruises, even
100 days or longer. First-timers should choose a short sailing to see
if they like the experience.</TE>
<TE>   Where do you want to go?</TE>
<TE>   Weekend or mini-cruises usually depart from Florida for the
Bahamas or from Los Angeles for Catalina Island and Baja California.
Seven-day cruises with air-and-sea packages let you sail around the
Hawaiian Islands, the Caribbean, the Mexican Riviera, Alaska, the
South Pacific or Europe. It usually takes 10 to 14 days for a Panama
Canal cruise with a full transit, although several ships offer
cruises into part of the canal during a seven-day Caribbean
itinerary.</TE>
<TE>   Are you traveling solo, as one of a pair or as part of a group?</TE>
<TE>   Your companions may have different needs or desires, so confer
with them before booking. On-board activities good for singles may
not work for families.</TE>
<TE>   What kind of shipboard lifestyle do you want?</TE>
<TE>   Jot down your most important requirements for a good vacation.
Although many stressed-out travelers picture a cruise ship as a place
to lounge quietly by the pool with a good book, after a couple of
days they may be ready for livelier activities. Almost all cruise
ships offer gyms, aerobics, lectures, shore-side golf and tennis,
dancing, bridge or crafts classes, casinos and even shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Do you want a large, medium or small ship?</TE>
<TE>   Big ships have more entertainment, bigger casinos and spas and
longer lines; medium-size ships have scaled-down versions of the
same. Small ships are more apt to be free from regimentation and
dress codes, but you may be on your own for entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Small to mid-size vessels usually have a more relaxed ambience,
while glittering mega-liners throb with music and bright lights most
of the night. But there's not a vessel afloat that doesn't have a
sunny, secluded corner for reading or a lively spot around the bar
for socializing.</TE>
<TE>   Do you want a classic (older) or contemporary (newer) ship?</TE>
<TE>   Most new ships will remind you of a chain resort hotel, complete
with atrium, glass elevators and identical modular cabins. Ships
built 20 or more years ago have ocean-liner looks, odd-size cabins
and nostalgic promenade decks.</TE>
<TE>   Do you want frequent opportunities to wear your party clothes or
would you prefer to stay casual day and night?</TE>
<TE>   Deluxe small ships are dressy, expedition and sailing ships
casual; big ships usually have two dress-up evenings a week.
Sometimes people who work in an office that requires business attire
every day welcome casual or adventure sailings where the dress code
may only request no bathing suits or bare feet at dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Do you want to go island-hopping on a ship that stops at a lot of
ports or spend your time relaxing aboard ship?</TE>
<TE>   If relaxing is more important, look for itineraries that designate
one or two days at sea during a seven-day cruise. You'll still have
ports to visit, but you can get some rest in between.</TE>
<TE>   What do you want to learn about the places you'll visit?</TE>
<TE>   If history, culture, flora and fauna are important, look for
expedition ships that emphasize natural history lectures and
bird-watching boat rides. Adventure and expedition cruises always
seem to attract a lot of doctors, lawyers, teachers and other
professionals who diligently attend all the lectures, then splash
ashore in rubber landing craft to go on nature hikes.</TE>
<TE>   If you prefer to know where to pick up Colombian emeralds or brand
names like Rolex or Lladro, any big mainstream cruise ship will fill
the bill with its "guaranteed shopping" programs subsidized by the
merchants being recommended.</TE>

<KH>Weekend Escape</KH>
<HD>In the shadow of celebrities and soldiers</HD>
<DH>William Randolph Hearst's hunting lodge is now a guest
house on a Monterey County Army base. Pay no mind to the bursts of
gunfire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vani Rangachar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Ft. Hunter Liggett Military Reserve, Calif.</DL>
<LD>One of the first signs that we were on an Army base was this posting
on the path that leads to the Hacienda Guest Lodge: "You are entering
a no-hat, no-salute area."</LD>
<LD>   The second came on our first morning here, the kind of day that
only California can deliver. Songbirds warbled. The mist had lifted,
and the sun was warm on my face as I sat on a rough-hewn bench under
a portico at the 18th century San Antonio de Padua Mission, not far
from the lodge. Then came the rat-a-tat-tat of machine-gun fire.</LD>
<LD>   This land in the hills northwest of Paso Robles in Monterey County
is one of the loveliest pieces of real estate in California, and the
Army owns it. If you can ignore some trivialities -- parking lots of
Humvees, Jeeps, tanks and camouflaged trucks, the sound of gunfire
from soldiers' practice sessions, some lapses in service and a slight
shabbiness at the lodge -- it's an interesting place to spend a
weekend.</LD>
<TE>   What drew us to this remote stretch of Central California was the
14-room Hacienda Guest Lodge and the chance to sleep where
millionaire publisher William Randolph Hearst and his movie star
friends once did. This was Hearst's hunting lodge, built mostly for
entertainment so he and his guests could ride on horseback the 30-odd
miles from his San Simeon estate to spend a night or a weekend. It
was designed by Julia Morgan, the celebrated architect of San Simeon,
and completed in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   Like Hearst's guests, my husband, Barry, and I were here for the
weekend, but we arrived not by private plane or horseback but by car
after a 250-mile drive from Los Angeles through Friday evening
traffic. After we were cleared to enter at the barricaded checkpoint,
we picked up our key from a waitress in the Hacienda's restaurant,
there being no readily identifiable reception area.</TE>
<TE>   Spacious but spare</TE>
<TE>   I was told, when I reserved a room in the two-story lodge, that we
would have a suite; at $125 a night it was the only room available
and the most expensive. But I wasn't prepared for the palatial size
of our first-floor accommodations. It had a nicely appointed sitting
room with a lovely arched brick fireplace, a large foyer, a
full-size, fully equipped kitchen, two bathrooms and three bedrooms
laid out one after another, like connecting rail cars. It felt
cavernous for just two of us but would have been ideal for a family.</TE>
<TE>   The bedrooms were cold and their decor spare -- bed, alarm clock,
lamp on a night table and space heater in a corner -- so we spent
most of our time in the heated sitting room, even sleeping there. It
was almost baroque by comparison, with a floral print couch, two
comfortable armchairs, books inside a barrister's bookcase and a TV
(which had no reception) with a VCR. (Videos were available in the
dining room.) There were some charming period pieces, such as a
Depression-style glass vase, and some comforting touches, like a
heater in the bathroom. But there was a shabbiness too: a loose towel
bar in the bathroom, a hole in the ceiling, a dirty and uninviting
swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, Morgan's graceful creation echoes the nearby mission. The
concrete-reinforced Spanish-style lodge has a U-shaped courtyard,
quatrefoil windows, colonnades with windows that look out on the
golden hills of the Santa Lucia range, arches and high ceilings.</TE>
<TE>   After the Army bought the property from Hearst in 1940, it altered
Morgan's structure. Some changes were necessary, like adding
electricity; some were decorative, like the murals that adorn the
dining room and bar. Some would make Morgan devotees cringe, like
changing the symmetry of her original design by closing off an
archway and blocking the curved stairway that led to the second-floor
Tower Room. Hearst slept in this room, which has a gold-painted dome.
It's the best at the lodge, a worker told me, but it was occupied, so
I couldn't peek in. We did look at a tiny room on the second floor.
With lovely arched and carved wood doors and latticework, it was more
atmospheric than our suite.</TE>
<TE>   We woke Saturday morning, expecting to have breakfast in the
dining room, but it was closed until 11 a.m. As I sat there grumping
about being in the middle of nowhere with no food, drinking the Sanka
with powdered cream that we had found in our suite's kitchen, I was
glad we'd had the foresight to indulge the previous night in a
five-course French meal at Bistro Laurent in Paso Robles. The
restaurant impressed us with its excellent service and food, which
included entrees of rack of lamb and sea bass.</TE>
<TE>   After Barry offered me the bowl of papier-mache fruit to boost my
spirits, we went to the mission, the third in the state, dedicated in
1771 by Father Junipero Serra. Its adobe lines were calming, despite
the occasional burst of machine-gun fire, and the interior of the
church was warm with pastel colors and the scent of votives. We spent
an hour here before hunger sent us foraging for food outside the Army
base.</TE>
<TE>   We found some packaged sandwiches and chips at a general store in
Lockwood a few miles east of the base and decided to picnic by the
shores of Lake Nacimiento. We paid $10 to sit by the lake and ate
sodden sandwiches at the privately owned resort, listening to the
whine of powerboats navigate drought-shrunken waters.</TE>
<TE>   But I was cheered by the drive on Monterey County Road G14, which
delivered a quintessential California landscape: golden hills dotted
with the rounded green canopies of live oaks, all free. (We also ran
into fist-size tarantulas crossing the roads.)</TE>
<TE>   The toast of the county</TE>
<TE>   We were on the edge of Paso Robles' wine country, so we took a
detour down oak-shaded lanes to Carmody McKnight, a tiny vineyard
that's known for its Zinfandel-like Cabernet Franc. We left toting a
bottle and a recommendation to try Pipestone, a new vineyard about 10
miles east on country roads.</TE>
<TE>   At Pipestone I found the pastoral scene I was seeking. Grapes hung
low on the vines, and a fountain splashed quietly.</TE>
<TE>   Our last winery stop offered something for each of us: For Barry
there were Bonny Doon wines. For me there was Sycamore Farms, an herb
nursery next door. Barry came away with a bottle of Big House Red,
and I had a wagonload of plants.</TE>
<TE>   After a stop to pick up groceries for the next day's breakfast, we
made it back to the Hacienda for cocktails as the sun was setting.
The bar has lovely bones but looks as though it's had a few too many
rough nights. The blare from the jukebox and the smell of stale
liquor drove us out to the expanse of lawn in front of the Hacienda,
which had a panoramic view of fields and hills. Sitting on the lawn,
I could imagine Hearst, Marion Davies, Clark Gable and Carole Lombard
enjoying the same sight.</TE>
<TE>   Our dinner of filet mignon and a hamburger at the restaurant was
far better than our lunch, and we left feeling satiated for the first
time that day. (The kitchen does fried and grilled food well.) We
retreated to our parlor, where I fell asleep and Barry settled into
an armchair with a book.</TE>
<TE>   Someone must have heard the rumblings and grumblings of my stomach
the day before. On Sunday morning we found two Danishes among the
packets of Sanka and tea, and we added them to the English muffins we
had bought the day before for our breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   For our return, we chose the route Hearst might have taken:
curving Nacimiento-Fergusson Road to the Pacific Coast Highway north
of San Simeon. It turned out to be another of the wonderfully scenic
drives we happened on that weekend: Trees in Los Padres National
Forest wore the colors of autumn -- a yellowing maple, the bright
reds of poison oak -- and the coastal fog that crept up the hillside
created a Zen-like beauty.</TE>
<TE>   We sped down PCH, past San Simeon, its towers gleaming on the
hill. The Hacienda was no enchanted castle, but it was close enough
for government work.</TE>

<LD>What better accompaniment for mobile multi-taskers than tools that
provide several fix-it aids in one portable unit. All these items
stash easily in a pocket or glove compartment. Some have sharp edges,

<LD>   PocketPro: This is a toolbox in a pouch. Most of the 18 implements
twist, swivel or pop out from an 8-by-1 3/8-by-1-inch-thick base,
converting the PocketPro into an adjustable wrench, a straight and
angle socket driver, a straight and angle screwdriver, a steel hammer
and a T-bar handle for high-torque fastening. In the handle are four
screwdriver bits (two Phillips, two slotted). A separate socket tray
holds nine 1/4-inch-drive sockets ( 3/16 inch through 1/2 inch). All
of this fits in an 8 1/2-by-3 1/2-inch nylon pouch and is easy to
carry.</LD>

<TE>   Ice Lite II: It's hard to believe there are 12 useful tools inside
the credit-card-size, 1.3-ounce Ice Lite II. If you look carefully at
the 1/8-inch-thick translucent plastic housing, you'll see tiny
scissors, a 2-inch serrated blade, mini-light, Phillips and flathead
screwdrivers, diminutive eyeglass screwdriver, staple puller, nail
file, tweezers, toothpick and inch/centimeter rulers. The Ice Lite II
I keep in my wallet has come in handy many times.</TE>

<TE>   CyberTool 41: The Swiss Army people never seem to tire of
tinkering with their knives. Among the latest is the CyberTool 41,
which, as its name implies, contains 41 tools useful in fixing
computers, specifically laptops, although the tools are equally
useful for lower-tech needs. Besides various blades and other
standard implements found in many Swiss Army knives, the hefty
CyberTool 41 has tiny pliers, screwdrivers, bits and sockets, a DIP
switch-setter (used to configure circuit boards), a bit wrench and
more. Also included is that essential mobile business tool, a
corkscrew.</TE>

<TE>   Utili-Key: At first glance, the Utili-Key appears to be an
odd-shaped key, but it's actually a six-in-one tool. Unfolded, the

knife blades. It weighs half an ounce and locks onto any key ring.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Niguel park brings Catalina close, the quiet closer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John McKinney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some hikers say a promontory in Seaview Park offers Orange County's
best coastal view. Certainly the vistas from this obscure Laguna
Niguel park are breathtaking, whether you're gazing toward the hills
behind Laguna Beach or down the coast to San Clemente.</LD>
<LD>   The overlook also offers an intriguing angle on Santa Catalina
Island, which appears so deceptively close on the horizon that you
can imagine hopping into a kayak and paddling into Avalon Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   Seaview Park, on the edge of Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness
Park, also boasts refreshing sea breezes, a nature trail and that
Orange County rarity, secluded picnic tables. You would expect the
park to be popular, but no: It seems off the radar of beachgoers half
a mile away as the gull flies.</LD>
<TE>   To reach the park, exit Interstate 5 at Crown Valley Parkway and
drive southwest five miles. Turn right (west) on Pacific Island Drive
and drive up the hill. Turn left on Talavera Street and follow it to
a cul-de-sac and the park entrance.</TE>
<TE>   An alternative route to the park is to exit I-5 at Alicia Parkway,
drive southwest, turn right onto Pacific Island and then turn right
onto Talavera.</TE>
<TE>   The park also is accessible from California Highway 1. Take Crown
Valley Parkway north and turn left onto Pacific Island Drive, then
left on Talavera.</TE>
<TE>   The hike is on a wide, gentle path of decomposed granite that
leads past interpretive panels and plants native in these parts, such
as coastal sage scrub and chaparral. Most visitors are content to
stop at the overlook, watch hawks soar over Aliso and Wood canyons
and admire the ocean view.</TE>
<TE>   But you can continue on a narrower, rougher path known as Aliso
Peak Trail. Railroad ties stabilize this trail, which leads to
another wonderful overlook.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, you'll pass two left-branching side trails. The
first, sometimes called Valido Trail, drops down to West Street in
South Laguna. The second descends to Ceanothus Drive.</TE>
<TE>   While you're in Laguna Niguel, drop by Niguel Botanical Preserve
in Crown Valley Community Park, 29751 Crown Valley Parkway. It's
about midway between Highway 1 and Interstate 5. The 18-acre
botanical garden displays Mediterranean-style flora that thrive in
temperate climates. A network of walking trails leads to plant
collections from California, Mexico, South America, southern Europe,
Africa and Australia.</TE>

<HD>Still looking for a holiday deal? You'll need to be
flexible</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Engle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you haven't made your holiday travel plans yet, you may be too
late for many destinations.</LD>
<LD>   In a typical year, that wouldn't be news because Thanksgiving,
Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year's are among the most in-demand
travel times. Warm-weather resorts book up months in advance, plane
seats disappear and air fares soar. Savvy travelers plan accordingly.</LD>
<LD>   But, of course, this hasn't been a typical year. The Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, the bombing in Bali and the uncertain economy have
disrupted travel patterns. Fewer people are flying, although air
fares have dropped. Travelers are booking hotels and tours at the
last minute, we're told.</LD>
<TE>   Except, experts say, when it comes to the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of Americans are looking forward to holiday travel, with
1 in 4 planning to take more trips this season than last, according
to a survey by Flight Plan for America, a project funded by the
airlines and travel agent groups. Some luxury resorts in Hawaii are
sold out for all the holidays. In Utah, showcased in the 2002 Winter
Olympics, bookings at the Canyons ski resort are running about double
from this time last year, and Snowbird's reservations are ahead of
2000, the resort's best year, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Pent-up demand from last year and a renewed emphasis on family
travel are contributing to the holiday crush, experts say. Bucking
the late-booking trend, many vacationers are reserving months ahead
for the holidays, says Jerry Cheske, a spokesman for AAA.</TE>
<TE>   Although AAA was still working on its forecasts when we spoke late
last month, Cheske is expecting holiday air travel to be up from last
year and car trips to be about the same. With flight cutbacks,
"travelers are fighting for fewer seats," Cheske says.</TE>
<TE>   Lowest available round-trip air fares for Thanksgiving were a
little higher than last year for LAX-Honolulu and about the same for
LAX-New York (JFK) when checked late last month, says Bob Harrell of
Harrell Associates in New York, which tracks fares through the
database that supplies computerized reservation systems used by
travel agents. (The dates checked were Nov. 27 outbound, Dec. 1
return.) Christmastime fares were down a bit from last year on both
routes. (The dates were Dec. 21 outbound, Dec. 29 return.)</TE>
<TE>   Much, of course, depends on where you want to go. The least
expensive LAX-Honolulu nonstop round trip I could find Oct. 22 at
www.orbitz.com for travel Nov. 27 to Dec. 1 or Dec. 21 to 29 was
close to $900. That's more than twice the round-trip fare to New York
and even more than a London round trip; winter is low season in
Northern Europe. (Fares may have changed since.)</TE>
<TE>   Higher fares to Honolulu reflect the popularity of tropical spots
for the holidays. Plane seats within the U.S. mainland are generally
more plentiful than to Hawaii or the Caribbean, says Michael Hannan,
owner of San Marin Travel in Novato, Calif. Sometimes "what we find
is that the resort is available -- it's the air that's the problem,"
he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some strategies the experts suggest for last-minute
holiday travelers:</TE>
<TE>   Stay flexible on dates: Christmas and New Year's Day both fall on
Wednesdays, so travel is expected to extend to weekends before and
after the holidays. If you avoid peak travel dates, such as Dec. 19
to 23 and Jan. 2, for instance, you're more apt to snag a reasonable
fare.</TE>
<TE>   When booking cruises and hotels, consider Thanksgiving or
Christmas rather than New Year's because New Year's trips tend to be
more popular -- and expensive.</TE>
<TE>   I hate to be a Scrooge, but the ultimate strategy is to avoid
holiday travel entirely and instead go right before or right after,
when prices are lower.</TE>
<TE>   Be cool, think urban: You don't have to go to the tropics or a ski
resort to have a good time. And they're not the places to look for
holiday bargains.</TE>
<TE>   Why not celebrate Christmas in cities that sport a signature
seasonal decoration: snow?</TE>
<TE>   This could be a good year to go to East Coast or Midwest cities.
Business travel, which has been slow for more than a year, reaches
its nadir at the holidays; who wants to hold a conference on
Christmas or Hanukkah? The result: empty hotel rooms, a few vacant
plane seats and some discounts.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Internet search on Four Seasons and Marriott hotel
sites, I found the Four Seasons Hualalai on the Big Island and
Marriott's Maui Ocean Club booked up for several holiday dates. But
top hotels in Chicago and New York had vacancies. And some had deals.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Marriott Downtown on tony Michigan Avenue, for
instance, had a room for $149 per night Nov. 27 to 29 under a "winter
values" rate, versus its "regular" rate of $389. The luxury Four
Seasons Hotel-Chicago had a room for $275 a night Dec. 21 to Dec. 27
under a "holiday" rate, versus the $430 "standard" rate for the same
room. (These rates may have changed since.)</TE>
<TE>   Both cities are hopping with holiday doings, from ice skating to
Christmas concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Look also for deals to Northern Europe, experts suggest. For
example, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a network of more than 1,000 travel
agencies, recently offered an eight-day tour of Christmas markets in
Germany and Austria from $549 per person, plus air fare. (This deal
may no longer be available.)</TE>
<TE>   Consider a cruise: If you want to get away from it all but don't
want to fly overseas, a holiday cruise could be just the ticket.
After Sept. 11, more lines relocated ships to U.S. mainland ports for
embarkation, and there are still some good cruise fares.</TE>
<TE>   As of Oct. 28, Carnival Cruise Lines had berths on Elation's
seven-day Mexico cruises departing Los Angeles starting at $649 for
Nov. 24 and at $1,269 for Dec. 29. Carlson Wagonlit offered seven-day
Christmas cruises in the Caribbean aboard Holland America ships
starting at $999.</TE>
<TE>   Enlist a travel agent: Last-minute spaces on cruises and tours can
pop up because of cancellations and other factors, but they tend to
be fleeting, Hannan says. Travel agents can help you act quickly
because they get daily updates from travel suppliers. Internet travel
sellers may require more work on your part, but they can be good
sources for eleventh-hour discounts.</TE>

<KH>TAKING THE KIDS</KH>
<HD>Young travelers discover a brave new world: a spa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eileen Ogintz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget that souvenir T-shirt or stuffed animal. These days, savvy
young travelers would rather splurge on a facial, a massage or a foot
soak.</LD>
<LD>   "Parents see spa-going as a new activity they can share with the
kids on vacation," says Suzanne Johnston, who oversees the spa at the
Westin Resort &amp; Spa in Whistler, British Columbia, and has seen
parents book massages for children as young as 6. "Money isn't the
issue; it's the experience."</LD>
<LD>   Susie Ellis, vice president for industry development at Spa
Finder, the leading spa-industry travel agent, has witnessed a surge
of interest in spa treatments for kids.</LD>
<TE>   Spa Finder magazine recently devoted an article to kid-friendly
spas, and the company's Web site, www.spafinder.com, offers a list of
the best spas for families. (Call Spa Finder at [800] ALL-SPAS
[255-7727].)</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting 50 calls a week asking about teen programs, double
what we got a year ago," Ellis said. "People don't see spas as places
for pampered women anymore. They're about wellness and fitness."</TE>
<TE>   And that apparently applies to kids as well as adults. Parents
want their teens to focus on fitness and healthy lifestyles. That's
part of the reason destination spas such as the Lake Austin Spa
Resort in Texas and Canyon Ranch in Arizona and Massachusetts offer
popular parent-teen packages that admit teens for half the price.</TE>
<TE>   "Vacations aren't just about lying on the beach," said Roxanne
Housley, vice president of sales for Canyon Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Austin Spa offers special mother-daughter weeks, with
sessions on communication, self-esteem and body image. Call (800)
847-5637 or visit www.lakeaustin.com. Canyon Ranch launched a similar
camp for teens last summer; call (800) 742-9000 or visit
www.canyonranch.com.</TE>
<TE>   Boys can be as enthusiastic as girls about spa-going, says
Charlotte Gottesman, a New Orleans grandmother who gathered her
children and grandchildren at Lake Austin Spa last Christmas rather
than at a traditional resort. Her grandsons loved the massages.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd gone to all kinds of resorts together," says the 74-year-old
Gottesman. "This was healthy for everyone and completely relaxing.
There weren't even complaints about the spa food."</TE>
<TE>   As the popularity of resort spas continues to grow -- the
International Spa Assn. reports that there are 1,150 around the
country, more than double the number two years ago -- kids are making
their presence felt at even the fanciest.</TE>
<TE>   At the Wyndham Peaks Resort and Golden Door Spa at Telluride,
Colo., one of ski country's biggest spas, children can take yoga
classes and families can book massages together. Call (800) 789-2220
or visit www.thepeaksresort.com.</TE>
<TE>   The spa at the Park Hyatt in Beaver Creek, Colo., sold about 160
teen facials -- at $110 a pop -- last winter, while Hawaii's Grand
Wailea on Maui sells even more. Call the Park Hyatt at (800) 55-HYATT
(554-9288) or visit www.beavercreek.hyatt.com; call the Grand Wailea
at (800) 888-6100 or visit www.grandwailea.com.</TE>
<TE>   "With society the way it is these days and kids under so much
pressure, they need to learn how to handle stress constructively,"
says Christie Ford, who spearheaded the recently opened kids' spa at
the Homestead resort in Virginia's Allegheny Mountains. Call (800)
838-1766 or visit www.thehomestead.com.</TE>
<TE>   Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys will offer an array of "teen
escape" treatments in a special area when its new spa opens in
December. Call (888) 443-6393 or visit www.hawkscay.com. Raoul Sudre,
a spa consultant and designer who serves on the board of directors of
the International Spa Assn., expects the family spa trend to
continue. "We're going to see more of this," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Adults don't seem to mind having kids around, especially when it's
at a kid-friendly resort.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had anyone complain," says Mary Gunderson of the
Beaver Creek Hyatt. "People seem to look at it with amusement."</TE>
<TE>   If you're planning to take your family to a spa, make sure the
resort you choose will permit children. If the spa has junior
programs or is in a kid-friendly resort, chances are it will welcome
your brood.</TE>
<TE>   Consider a trial run at a less expensive day spa. Estee Lauder
spas have special teen treatments, and others host birthday parties
or offer "teen nights."</TE>
<TE>   Sylvi Munts, a Virginia mother of four, is convinced that massages
have tremendous therapeutic value for kids and are worth the cost.</TE>
<TE>   "Going to the spa does the same thing for the kids as it does for
me," she says. "They walk out feeling better."</TE>

<LD>It seems that the companion of author Rosemary McClure ("In Oxnard,

<DL></DL>
<LD>With reference to "Topanga, Down to Earth and Yet Worlds Away" (Oct.
13): It is possible to obtain better lodging near Topanga that offers
more than adequate blankets for a little more money. The Malibu Beach
Inn on Pacific Coast Highway is a beautiful hotel, right on the
water, with almost all ocean-view rooms, starting at $149 on
weekdays. It is about six miles north of the Topanga Canyon Boulevard
intersection.</LD>

<LD>Writer Mona Molarsky recommended the Columbia Hotel in London in
"Kidding Around With the Bard in London" (Aug. 18), saying it was a
trip back in time. My wife and I just got back from London and stayed
there. The walls were paper thin. All the rooms faced the busy
highway, so we got no sleep.</LD>
<LD>   The only plus was the price of the room. If this was the reason
for choosing the hotel, why didn't you mention it?</LD>

<LD>Regarding "Careful Planning and Little Comforts Can Help Smooth the
Way for Seniors" (Sept. 15): Having a younger companion is a lovely
idea, as it would take care of a huge problem most seniors have when
traveling -- carrying luggage.</LD>
<LD>   Millions of us seniors who try to keep traveling as we get older
find we have more and more handicaps that hamper our mobility and
strength.</LD>
<LD>   Travel is no longer possible for me because I am a 91-year-old who
cannot move a filled suitcase. I have only my memories of the 61
countries I managed to visit, despite hardships that included flights
of stairs at train stations where luggage with wheels was of no use;
long stations where I had to drag my luggage for a quarter of a mile
or longer, with no available luggage carts; airlines that charged
extra to provide oxygen in flight while not allowing me to carry my
own; not being able to lift luggage into the overhead bins.</LD>

<LD>American to raise passenger award levels</LD>
<LD>   Starting May 1, frequent fliers will need more miles for several
types of award travel from American Airlines, the world's biggest.</LD>
<LD>   An unrestricted economy round-trip ticket within the continental
U.S. and Canada will cost 50,000 instead of 40,000 miles, the airline
told AAdvantage members last month. The restricted version of this
ticket will stay at 25,000 miles. Unrestricted first-class or
business tickets within the continental U.S. and Canada will go for
90,000 instead of 80,000 miles; the restricted version will change
from 40,000 to 45,000 miles.</LD>
<TE>   Airlines generally limit the number of seats for restricted award
travel; the more costly unrestricted awards can be applied to any
flight with available seats.</TE>
<TE>   In making the changes, American was matching policies of
competitors Continental and Northwest and "in many cases" Delta, a
spokeswoman noted. (For first class, Delta was still charging 80,000
miles for unrestricted and 40,000 miles for restricted round-trip
tickets as of last week.)</TE>
<TE>   United, the No. 2 airline, was still matching American's current,
lower mileage requirements as of last week.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news ... is they haven't touched the most popular
award," the 25,000-mile restricted ticket, Tim Winship, publisher of
FrequentFlier.com, said of American's action.</TE>
<TE>   No more idling on deck -- you've got mail</TE>
<TE>   First it was e-mail access on cruise ships. Then Internet cafes.
And now you can log on poolside, in the lounge or anywhere else on
board.</TE>
<TE>   So much for getting away from it all.</TE>
<TE>   This fall Norwegian Cruise Line began offering remote wireless
Internet access on its Norwegian Sun. By the end of this year, in
what it claims is a first for the industry, it plans to expand it to
the whole fleet.</TE>
<TE>   Guests pay $10 per day for a wireless network card that they can
use in their own laptop or pay $35 per day to rent a laptop equipped
with the card. They're also charged 75 cents per minute of Internet
time. (Packages can reduce this to 40 cents per minute.)</TE>
<TE>   The company "recognizes that many passengers feel the need to stay
connected while on vacation," said Colin</TE>
<TE>   Veitch, the president of Norwegian.</TE>
<TE>   Examining the universe of Albert Einstein</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to be a genius to appreciate "Einstein," a major
exhibit on the groundbreaking physicist Albert Einstein, opening Nov.
15 in New York.</TE>
<TE>   To document his life there are photos and personal items, some on
display in the U.S. for the first time, such as his diary and a
report card from his Swiss high school. To illuminate his theories,
there are a hands-on physics lab, a kinetic sculpture and a wall-size
interactive computer screen. Several handwritten pages from his 1912
manuscript on the "Special Theory of Relativity" will be displayed
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit, billed as the most comprehensive ever, is organized
by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Skirball Cultural Center
in Los Angeles and the American Museum of Natural History in New
York. It runs through Aug. 10 at the American Museum, then travels to
other museums, including the Skirball (in 2004). Adult entrance is
$17, including museum admission. Open daily; hours vary. (212)
769-5100 (recorded information), (212) 769-5200 (tickets),
www.amnh.org.</TE>
<TE>   Traveler's note</TE>
<TE>   One of America's most fascinating utopian movements is the subject
of the Shaker Historic Trail, a new online itinerary at
www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel. (Look under the "Northeast" regional
heading.) It was produced by the National Park Service and other
groups and profiles 15 historic Shaker settlements in seven states,
including nine sites open to visitors. (One active community remains,
at Sabbathday Lake, Maine.)</TE>
<TE>   DEAL OF THE WEEK</TE>
<TE>   A free ride for kids at ski resorts</TE>
<TE>   Children can fly free to Vail/Eagle County Airport in Colorado and
ski free at Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge or Keystone resorts
under a deal valid for travel Dec. 1 to Feb. 14, except for holiday
travel dates. (Contact the resorts for specifics.) Children ages 2 to
12 are eligible for a free companion ticket on American Airlines when
accompanied by a paying adult (one free child fare per adult). They
can also stay free and get one free lift ticket for every adult lift
ticket. Various restrictions apply; for instance, you can't fly on a
Saturday or Sunday. For information, see a travel agent or contact
Vail Resorts Central Reservations, (800) 404-3535.</TE>

<HD>Tramping New Zealand</HD>
<DH>On the South Island, it's fun and games with Kiwis on a
privately operated trail that delivers fine coastal scenery, rustic
lodgings and, happily, no crowds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert C. Diemer</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Akaroa, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>My hiking socks were melting. The quick-drying blend of wool and
space-age fibers smoldered on the grate by the fire, forgotten as I
fixed breakfast. The parlor of Flea Bay Hut filled with acrid smoke.
John Evans, a late-rising Kiwi, wrinkled his nose as he bumped into
the kitchen. "What's that awful smell?"</LD>
<LD>   "The Yank's socks," replied his mate, Don Reilly, stirring his
porridge.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey, Yank," John said. "You should try washing them." Laughter
filled the hut and lifted a bit of the fog that promised to cling
through our second day of backpacking on the Banks Peninsula Track.
John and Don -- stand-up and straight man, respectively -- provided
comic relief, as they had all along the scenic coastal trail, with
Kiwi idioms, tall tales and wry humor. As usual, the greater part of
New Zealand's charm was in the breezy grace of its residents.</LD>
<TE>   Backpacking, or "tramping," to use the Kiwi term for one of their
favorite pastimes, can reward and frustrate visitors to New Zealand.
The South Pacific nation boasts scores of backpacking trails that
traverse terrains ranging from flat beaches to alpine ridges. But the
popularity of certain trails can detract from the experience of
hiking them.</TE>
<TE>   More than 20,000 trekked the Coastal Track at Abel Tasman National
Park last year. The Milford Track, considered by many to be the
finest walk in the world, is so crowded that hikers need reservations
six months in advance. Huts along some routes are full by
midafternoon, and latecomers are forced to camp or hike to another
hut. Treks can turn into a race to claim the next hut's bunks, and
poor company can spoil a good walk.</TE>
<TE>   But the Banks Peninsula, or "BP Track," on the South Island is
different. It is New Zealand's first private hiking trail, owned and
operated by farmers and landowners, who have earmarked a part of the
proceeds from fees of $59 to $88 to preserve native vegetation and
wildlife along it. The trail is limited to 16 backpackers a day. The
track's four huts are spaced no more than six hours apart, and
because hikers don't have to fight for a bunk each night, they can
find their own pace, explore side trails or linger at lookouts.
Hikers can also get to know the quirks of those on the trail with
them. If they are lucky, as I was, most of their companions will be
Kiwis. In my group of 10, eight were Kiwis. Another solo hiker and I
took the remaining slots.</TE>
<TE>   I had encountered the Kiwis' fun-loving nature on my first trip to
New Zealand, a four-month bicycle tour of the North and South islands
about a dozen years ago. I returned in October, springtime here, to
explore on foot parts of the country I couldn't see from the saddle
of a touring bicycle. In Christchurch I heard about the BP Track from
travelers who talked enthusiastically about its varied scenery and
easy pace. I called the BP Track on a whim and grabbed the only
opening available for four days on the trail.</TE>
<TE>   The 22-mile loop begins and ends near Akaroa, a fishing town on a
fiord-like harbor about a 90-minute drive southeast from
Christchurch. Classified as an easy tramp, the track can be tackled
in two days, but most hikers choose to take four, a more leisurely
pace suitable for almost any adult or teenager.</TE>
<TE>   The French influence</TE>
<TE>   The village of Akaroa proved a pleasant start to my hike. The town
of 750 now relies more on tourism than fishing. Founded by French
settlers in 1840 on the site of a Maori village, Akaroa still has
touches of "la belle"  France, a standout in Anglican New Zealand.
Some of the town's streets are called rue and have Parisian-style
street lamps. A few buildings sport wrought-iron balcony railings.
Many cafes and restaurants embrace their French connection, serving
Gallic cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   I spent my first night on the track at the Trampers' Hut at the
Onuku Farm Hostel just outside town. Bedding was a step up from the
squeaky vinyl mattresses common to many New Zealand back-country
huts, but they were bunk beds nonetheless: one up, one down, in rooms
of four or six bunks at Onuku, Flea Bay and Otanerito. But we spent
little time inside. Instead everyone gathered on the porch for the
sunset over Akaroa Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning I started up the track, climbing the steep inner
slope of an ancient volcano. It was a relentless introduction to
Banks Peninsula topography, mostly the eroded remains of several
extinct volcanoes and hills 2,100 to 2,600 feet high. From the trail
head at Onuku Hostel, at about 650 feet, I climbed to a 2,300-foot
pass on a trail that, for the most part, was a straight run so steep
I could barely place my foot down flat. The first stretch crossed
open meadows, one of the few places in New Zealand where hikers have
to share trails with sheep. The only shade in the initial climb was
about halfway up, where a few trees guarded the tumbled remains of an
abandoned farm.</TE>
<TE>   Overheated and panting beneath a pack stuffed with four days'
worth of food, a change of clothes and a sleeping bag, I struggled to
keep pace with long-legged Don and seemingly inexhaustible John. But
the first stretch was by far the roughest, and the reward for the
climb was on a side trail that scrambled to a vantage of Akaroa
Harbor. On a clear day, I was told, it's possible to glimpse
12,349-foot Mt. Cook, New Zealand's highest peak, 150 miles
southwest. But there was no prizewinning view for me because it was
hazy.</TE>
<TE>   The track then loops down to beaches, bays and headlands, finally
returning over the crest to Akaroa. The dramatic coast is the major
draw, with arches and sea stacks, blowholes and beaches, and the
realization that the next landfall is Antarctica.</TE>
<TE>   At one point the trail sloped into a wooded gully carved by a
chilly, spring-fed stream and dotted with small ponds. Near one
waterfall I came upon John and Don by a pool.</TE>
<TE>   "Fancy a swim, Yank?" John asked. "The water sure looks
refreshing."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't let him tempt you, mate." Don pointed to a corner of the
pool where a lamb had tumbled in and drowned, polluting all water
downstream. Both Kiwis disappeared down the trail, John grumbling
that Don had spoiled his fun.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day I joined the pair for a bracing ocean swim, though
the cold water chased me out early. John later stomped back to the
Flea Bay Hut, claiming that after I had left, he had waltzed with a
sea lion. Don translated: "We saw a sea lion while swimming."</TE>
<TE>   "You were near enough," John said. "But you were too shy to cut
in."</TE>
<TE>   The track passes sites important to the Banks Peninsula's tangled
history, beginning at the French settlement of Akaroa and passing
Maori fortifications and battle sites that predate the arrival of the
Europeans here, as well as whaling outposts, seal skinners' huts and
sheep ranches. Plant species native only to New Zealand, some marked
with placards, are also found along the track: red and silver beech;
mamuku, or tree ferns, which resemble green parasols; and the odd
totara, a pine-like tree cloaked in soft, fine needles.</TE>
<TE>   The BP Track is no wilderness venture. Three huts have
electricity, while a fourth is blissfully off the grid. The parlor of
the Flea Bay Hut, an old farmhouse at the end of the first's day's
hike, had a piano, easy chairs, a sofa and National Geographics going
back decades.</TE>
<TE>   After rummaging in the bookshelves, Don uncovered a large roll of
butcher paper on which was written the lyrics to at least three dozen
songs. After supper, our group -- strangers 24 hours earlier -- began
singing the tunes we knew and making up music for those we didn't.
The songfest turned into a game of charades. At evening's end, Don
summed up our sentiment by writing in the guest book, "Good company."</TE>
<TE>   Spying fur seals</TE>
<TE>   On Days 2 and 3, I climbed headlands and descended into coves
along the Pacific shoreline. The grade was gentle, though, and the
route stayed well back from cliffs that dropped sharply into the
ocean. I saw a large colony of New Zealand fur seals, hunted nearly
to extinction, on a sheltered beach. They were wary of human
approach, but by keeping head down and mouth shut, I was able to
creep close -- until a large bull noticed me and roared, its red
mouth rimmed with sharp teeth.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the second day I settled in at Stony Bay, more a
compound than a hut. Stony Bay looks like a 12-year-old's idea of
what a campground should be, with resourceful use of recycled
materials and close attention to details.</TE>
<TE>   Don and John wielded walking sticks for cues to clack balls into
paint-can pockets at an outdoor pool table, which used burlap for
felt and recycled inner tubes for railings. The shower, built partly
on and partly from a tree stump, had towel hooks fashioned from
driftwood and deer antlers. An enormous whalebone framed the door of
one hut.</TE>
<TE>   The campground had a small shop, operated on the honor system,
that was stocked with dehydrated food and other backpacker
necessities, plus a few unheard-of luxuries for hikers: cheese,
steaks, even stream-cooled beer and wine. But Stony Bay's biggest
attraction was the Kiwi-style hot tub. Behind some bushes was a
claw-foot bathtub squatting over a firebox. I filled the tub, started
a fire and returned in an hour for a relaxing outdoor bath, with
Stony Bay Creek gurgling to one side.</TE>
<TE>   Stony Bay's whimsical atmosphere brought out a collective sense of
fun among our group. Ian Hamilton repaid one prank by swiping John's
clothes as he soaked in the hot tub and hanging them from bushes on
the far side of camp. After supper, in the hut's warm lantern glow,
our group resumed our songfest, charades and the New Zealand version
of Trivial Pursuit. One by one and, yes, two by two, we traipsed out
to the hot tub to soak, the last ones to find that the clouds had
lifted, the night sky sprawled with Southern Hemisphere stars down to
the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   Day 3's hike was a breezy stroll along the ocean. I dawdled at
Sleepy Bay, which has a sylvan though unused campsite, with a
waterfall on one side and booming surf on the other. Sleepy Bay was
once the site of a bloody battle among Maori tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Day 4 was strenuous. As on the first day, the trail climbed to the
crest of the ancient volcano, this time up the gentler outer slope. I
crossed the meadows of the Otanerito Valley, dotted with slender
kahikatea trees, then entered a stand of native kanuka trees. When
their branches bumped together, they gave out a hollow, clunking
sound, and it seemed as if I were strolling through a forest of
bamboo wind chimes.</TE>
<TE>   Next was the private Hinewai Reserve, the botanical highlight of
the track. The Hinewai keeps nonnative plants and animals at bay. An
ongoing project, partly funded by fees paid by BP Track hikers,
uproots gorse, a prickly shrub that in springtime practically glows
with yellow-orange blossoms. Gorse, brought to New Zealand in the
1800s as ground cover and sheep fodder, quickly crowds out native
species.</TE>
<TE>   The high point of my fourth day, a 1,935-foot pass called Purple
Peak Saddle, wasn't lofty enough for me, so I shrugged off my pack
and scaled stony Taraterehu. At 2,644 feet, Taraterehu is one of the
tallest peaks on the peninsula. At its summit, I peered down into
Akaroa, which seemed to lie at my feet, and away to the southwest, I
glimpsed a sight that haze had denied me three days before: the
pinnacle of Mt. Cook.</TE>
<TE>   It was a fine walk, improved by the good company of Kiwis.</TE>

<HD>In Mexico, post-hurricane woes</HD>
<DH>Puerto Vallarta cleans up and reopens many resorts, but
some will need major repairs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Froylan Enciso</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before Hurricane Kenna slammed into Mexico's Pacific Coast on Oct.
25, tourists and residents fled a 200-mile stretch of coastline that
included Puerto Vallarta. Although the resort city was spared the
full force of Kenna's 145-mph winds -- the eye of the storm hit 65
miles north -- Puerto Vallarta did suffer some damage.</LD>
<LD>   As of the Travel section's deadline Tuesday, highways to and from
the city were open, as was the airport, which restored all flights a
few hours after the storm hit. The city's marina and golf courses
were operating as usual. Electricity, drinking water, telephone
service and drainage systems were back to normal.</LD>
<LD>   But four tourist hotels sustained major damage and were closed.
The Continental Plaza is expected to be out of commission at least
four months, the Suns Resort for three months, and the Plaza
Pelicanos and Las Palmas for two months, according to the Puerto
Vallarta Hotels and Motels Assn.</LD>
<TE>   The Crowne Paradise, Holiday Inn, Rosita and Pescador hotels
reported damage to some rooms and parts of their lobbies but remained
open. Guest services at all four hotels were back to normal, with one
notable exception: The Rosita's 10 small boats, available to guests
for sportfishing, were destroyed, along with part of the local
fishing fleet. Larger boats operated by other hotels escaped damage.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Puerto Vallarta's hotels are along a 1,000-yard stretch of
coastal road known as the Malecon. The storm disabled traffic lights
along the road, and police closed the entire stretch to vehicles.
Hotels on the Malecon were accessible by car from side streets, and
the Malecon itself remained open to pedestrian traffic. On Tuesday,
city officials said the Malecon was expected to reopen by today.</TE>
<TE>   Salvador Pena, the city's director of tourism, said all but two of
Puerto Vallarta's 400 restaurants are open. El Dorado and La Palapa,
located along the Malecon, lost their roofs in the storm and suffered
heavy damage. Pena said both restaurants expected to restore limited
service in temporary quarters by today while they rebuild.</TE>
<TE>   Cruise ships have resumed calling on the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We see businesses working, we see hotels working," Mexican
President Vicente Fox said last week during a tour of Puerto
Vallarta. "As for what's not working, we're talking to the governor
to get it working as soon as possible."</TE>

<HD>A budding affection for Boquete</HD>
<DH>Far from the monotony of the historic canal, this endearing
and little-known town in the cool, lush highlands boasts a wild
bounty of colorful flora, fauna and scenery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Yvonne Michie Horn</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Boquete, Panama</DL>
<LD>It has always bewildered me, this fascination with cruising through
the Panama Canal. The water goes up, the ship goes through, the water
goes down. I know the canal is an engineering marvel, but as an
exercise in appreciation, I'd rather count rivets in the Eiffel
Tower. Since "canal" and "Panama" go together like "horse" and
"carriage," I relegated Panama to my Z list.</LD>
<LD>   Then I learned about Boquete.</LD>
<LD>   A contributor to the San Francisco Chronicle, my hometown
newspaper, wrote about a Panamanian Shangri-La in the cool highlands
of Chiriqui where there were rushing trout-filled streams, a lush
mountain rain forest, abundant orange groves and coffee plantations,
and a picture-postcard town chockablock with flower gardens. This
idyllic place, the writer went on to say, was known only to the
well-to-do of Panama looking to escape the mugginess and mosquitoes
of the lowlands.</LD>
<TE>   Panama leaped to the A list.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring I enticed my traveling companion, David, who does not
share my views about the canal and has been through it three times,
to come with me to Boquete, a town of about 3,000. As our plane
circled Panama City, I could see dozens of ships waiting to take the
shortcut across the isthmus. Poor devils. I was on my way to
paradise.</TE>
<TE>   From Panama City we took an hour's flight to David (not to be
confused with my companion), the capital of Chiriqui province and,
with about 75,000 residents, Panama's second most populous city. As
we made our way through its traffic-congested sprawl, we began to
worry that we had taken a wrong turn to "idyllic," supposedly but 25
miles away.</TE>
<TE>   But at the outskirts of town, the two-lane road began a winding
climb. With every turn the air grew fresher, the grass and trees
greener. As the odometer clicked the last of the 25 miles, we began a
sudden steep descent and found ourselves in a deep valley surrounded
by craggy mountains. In its center, Boquete. Not until later did we
learn that boquete does not mean "bouquet," as we'd assumed, but
actually "hole." No matter. Boquete is one flowery hole.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers, flowers and flowers</TE>
<TE>   Amodest sign at the edge of unpaved Jaramillo Alba Road above town
announced the presence of La Montana y el Valle inn. We beeped our
horn, as instructed, and iron gates slid open, revealing an
asphalt-paved but gravity-defying downhill drive. Owners Barry
Robbins and Jane Walker, Canadian expatriates, greeted us and showed
us to our cottage. Besides their own residence, Barry and Jane have
three housekeeping cottages, with two or three bedrooms and
well-equipped kitchenettes.</TE>
<TE>   "When we bought the site in 1996, the locals considered us daft,"
Jane said as she led us to our cottage. " 'Crazy Canadians, they
bought land you can't get to, and when you get there you can't build
on it.' Evidently they'd never heard of stilts!"</TE>
<TE>   The cottages are situated for absolute privacy. Ours had a
stunning view across the valley to the mountains beyond. A light mist
enveloped us as we admired the scene -- the every-afternoon bajareque
that Jane described as a "warm blizzard full of rainbows." As if on
cue, a perfect rainbow arch touched down on either side of Boquete.
Jane smiled. "We are rather smitten with this place."</TE>
<TE>   Jane and Barry came to Boquete after working for years in Canada
as information systems consultants. Not surprisingly, the two are
well organized. Information sheets arrived by e-mail before our
departure covering topics from inn policies to a list of nearby
explorations and activities. We would have no trouble filling our
allotted four nights.</TE>
<TE>   Initial excursions took us to flowers, flowers and more flowers.
We passed maintenance crews using machetes to hack at colorful clouds
of bougainvillea threatening to take over the roads. Impatiens, in
every shade of the impatiens rainbow, interspersed with frothy flings
of blue forget-me-nots, blanketed hillsides. Aerial gardens of
orchids, aroids and bromeliads nestled in the high branches of trees.
Lacy tree ferns towered man-high; mosses muffled almost every
available surface. Nearly every front yard in Boquete seemed to
sprout a hand-lettered sign, "Se venden plantas" -- plants for sale.</TE>
<TE>   El Explorador, an open-air family-run restaurant steps away from
La Montana y el Valle, introduced us to Boqueteans' penchant for
gilding the lily of their gardens with eccentricity. Behind the
cafeteria, where our halting Spanish procured for us a tasty steak
flanked by fried plantains instead of the cooling fresh-fruit drink
we had envisioned, piped-in arias encouraged us to explore the lushly
cultivated hillside. Tucked here and there along maze-like pathways,
gutted TV sets were outfitted with bizarre dioramas that had nothing
to do with flora and fauna. We passed bushes sheared into improbable
shapes. One was trimmed to resemble a furry animal's face; in its
mouth, a doll. A shoe tree was exactly that, a straggly tree branched
with footwear from moldy sneakers to spangled high-heeled slippers.
Almost with relief, we spotted exit arrows and popped out of "Alice
in Wonderland," Panamanian style.</TE>
<TE>   Another day we visited Mi Jardin Es Su Jardin (My Garden Is Your
Garden), a horticultural Eden surrounding a private estate on the
outskirts of Boquete. Here the lily is embellished with what appears
to be dozens of escapees from a miniature golf course: little Dutch
windmills, a blue cow, a Hansel and Gretel house and wee castles,
along with cutouts of children at play.</TE>
<TE>   With that, the gardens of Boquete's fairgrounds, where the town's
annual Feria de las Flores y del Cafe (Fair of Flowers and Coffee) is
held in January, are hardly surprising. Here we found even more
brightly painted little lighthouses, multistoried birdhouses perched
on tall poles and park benches disguised as dragons. Beds of flowers
familiar from garden stores at home -- petunias, marigolds,
snapdragons -- were planted with brilliant abandon. Alongside
stretched the sparkling Rio Caldera. Across the river is Boquete,
with its church spire peeking through the trees, and beyond, rugged
mountains with their tops adrift in clouds, including those of Parque
Nacional Volcan Baru, Panama's tallest mountain at 11,400 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Clouds and orchid thieves</TE>
<TE>   A day hike took us into the cloud forests of the Palo Alto
Reserve, guided by Danny Poirier, also a Canadian expat. Within
minutes, we encountered a washed-out bridge over a treacherously
deep, rushing stream. As we debated between taking a slippery,
boot-soaking wade or shimmying across on a slender downed tree, three
Panamanians in thigh-high rubber boots sloshed into the water,
machetes swinging at their sides. "Who are they?" I asked. "Orchid
poachers," Danny replied.</TE>
<TE>   To protect the country's natural richness, including hundreds of
rare orchid species, 30% of the land has been designated as national
parks, preserves and refuges. The areas, however, are understaffed
and underprotected.</TE>
<TE>   Choosing a boot soaking, we made our way across the stream. Our
steep and slippery footpath took us into a world of infinite shades
of green brightened with spikes of ginger, tree-clinging bromeliads
and countless other flowering plants that we had seen only in
florists' shops.</TE>
<TE>   At one juncture we emerged from damp greenery into a sunny
clearing waving with gladioli gone wild and carpeted with
out-of-control patches of Shasta daisies, which we greeted like an
old friend. This was an abandoned cut-flower nursery, Danny explained
as he dug roots of Shasta daisy to take home to propagate. He too had
a "Se venden plantas" sign on the fence of his garden in Boquete.</TE>
<TE>   It is a wonder who is buying the plantas everyone has for sale
here. As idyllic as the area is, tourism has barely arrived. The town
goes unself-consciously about its everyday business, making its one
main street and its central plaza a people-watching delight. Inside
the mercado, vegetables and fruits fill the stalls, indicating the
agricultural richness of the surrounding mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Guaymi Indian women padded by, dressed in traditional garb,
voluminous hand-stitched dresses made up of rows of blue, red and
green triangular trimming. Chiriqui is home to about 125,000 Guaymi,
many of whom make their way to the highlands at coffee picking time
and stay on as farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   If one is yearning for a pizza or Mexican fare, there is a choice
of restaurants on the main drag. But lucky guests of La Montana y el
Valle can eat their evening meal in their room, having given warning
to Jane and Barry, both gifted cooks. A knock at the cottage door
would announce Barry's arrival, crisp linens in hand, to set our
table. Candles lighted, our "waiter" would return with salads of
freshly picked greens from the inn's garden and our chosen entrees:
Indonesian chicken one night, a light-as-air moussaka another.
Dessert? Of course, with carrot cake a standout.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, Dave and I often wandered the paths that wind
through coffee bushes (the property has been returned to a working
plantation) and orange trees (original rootstock from Riverside in
the Inland Empire) on La Montana y el Valle's now-manicured grounds.
Under a canopy of stars, we heard nothing but the chirp of insects.</TE>
<TE>   At dawn on our last day in Boquete, while the valley's surrounding
mountains were still etched black against the departing night, we
wandered out on our cottage deck, coffee cups in hand. Gradually a
stain of pink appeared in the sky, turning golden as the sun made its
way over the mountains, spotlighting first just one section of craggy
peak, then another, until all of Boquete was bathed in gentle light.
The call of one bird -- more than seven dozen species have been
spotted to date on the property -- grew into a whistling, chirping,
chiming morning chorus.</TE>
<TE>   Like Jane and Barry, we too had become smitten with the place.</TE>

of Oceanside caught these 1959 fins in Detroit at this year's Grand
National Meet of the Cadillac LaSalle Club, a group of about 7,000
classic-car enthusiasts. Armbruster, a club member, says the August

Europe. "They're timeless," says Armbruster, who owns 10 cars,
including a '63 Cadillac convertible and a '59 turquoise Coupe de

<HD>World War II novels are a tour guide of the imagination</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was sick with the flu recently, so I spent four days on the couch,
sleeping and reading through a stack of Alan Furst spy novels: "Night
Soldiers," "The Polish Officer," "Red Gold" and others, all set in
Europe from 1933 to 1945.</LD>
<LD>   Reading fiction is right up there with travel for me. The novels I
admire most have a strong sense of place, brought to life by writers
who research by traveling.</LD>
<LD>   Furst, who writes about men caught in deadly games of espionage as
Hitler rolls across Europe, was inspired to try fiction after writing
several travel articles on the Danube River and Spain. His interest
even then was "political travel," he told me in a recent phone
interview.</LD>
<TE>   "The places I write about may not have the finest hotels and
cuisine, but the events that go on there are interesting," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Time has changed many of these places, like Paris under German
occupation and Bucharest, Romania, during the 1941 uprising of the
fascist Iron Guard. Bucharest was heavily bombed during World War II,
then rebuilt along stark Stalinist lines. Paris survived the war
mostly unscathed, with little left to recall dark days in the City of
Light. To recapture the Paris of the early 1940s, Furst wandered the
city widely, he told me.</TE>
<TE>   While I languished on my sickbed, I devised a tour -- which could
be done but is probably best taken in the imagination -- of places
described in Furst's most recent novel, "Blood of Victory" (Random
House, 2002). It begins in November 1940, just after France's
surrender to Germany. Its hero, I.A. Serebin, a Russian emigre writer
who lives in Paris, is crossing the Black Sea from Odessa to Istanbul
on a freighter. He smokes a cigarette, then goes back to bed, where
the beautiful Marie-Galante, who lures him into spying for the
British, awaits him.</TE>
<TE>   When he reaches Istanbul, Serebin goes to a summer house on the
Bosporus, where an old lover is dying of tuberculosis. The house is
in the Besiktas district, which was then a fishing village but has
since been subsumed by the city. I remember the area vaguely because
I once passed it on a sightseeing cruise on the Bosporus. If I
returned, I'd stay at the nearby Ciragan Palace Hotel, a lavish,
Rococo marble affair occupied by sultans from 1874 to 1910.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting the Hungarian spymaster who lives in Istanbul and
directs his clandestine operations, Serebin returns to Paris on the
Orient Express. During its heyday in the 1930s, the fabled luxury
train, featured in Agatha Christie's "Murder on the Orient Express,"
carried movie stars, kings and secret agents between Paris and
Istanbul. The trip can still be made on the refurbished Venice
Simplon Orient-Express in five nights, with sightseeing stops in
Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.</TE>
<TE>   Serebin arrives in Paris and catches a taxi to the shabby hotel
where he lives, passing places well known to lovers of the Left Bank.
"Rue de Bucie -- a shopping street, Rue de l'Echaude. Then the Place
St-Germain-des-Pres, with a Metro station and the smart cafes -- the
Flore and the Deux Magots. Then, his very own Rue du Dragon."</TE>
<TE>   Furst told me he made up Serebin's hotel on narrow, winding Rue du
Dragon. But the Hotel du Dragon is a perfect double for the one in
the book. In 1994, when I stayed there, it had dark, narrow corridors
and threadbare carpets, rooms with sagging beds, old armoires and
toilets down the hall.</TE>
<TE>   The Pont-Royal, where Serebin often stops to smoke and think,
still crosses the Seine from the Tuileries to Rue du Bac, and you can
still dine at the Brasserie Bofinger in the Marais. This venerable
Parisian eatery, founded in 1864, is the model for the Brasserie
Heininger, which appears in all of Furst's novels, a place where
Germans wine and dine French collaborators.</TE>
<TE>   From Paris, "Blood of Victory" moves to Bucharest, where Serebin
and Marie-Galante stay in the grand early 20th century Plaza Athenee
Hotel, now a Hilton. There they plot to sink several barges at a
narrow point in the Danube River, thereby cutting off the flow of
Romanian oil to Nazi Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The operation gets underway in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, as Serebin
acquires barges and a tugboat. You can see the Belgrade waterfront on
a sightseeing cruise, offered by the city's tourism bureau from April
to November, or better still, take a long trip down the Danube. The
European river cruise company Uniworld and the German company Peter
Deilmann Cruises sail from Vienna or Budapest, Hungary, to the Black
Sea, passing through the Iron Gate, a series of rapids between
Romania and Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   The Iron Gate is the scene of the book's climax, but I won't
reveal what happens. A good book, like a good trip, ought to have a
surprise ending.</TE>

<HD>A 'Life' That's Bonnie Hunt All Over</HD>
<DH>The Second City veteran uses her improv skills to write,
act and direct a sitcom that is shot in a unique way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bonnie Hunt is still on a high from working with veteran comedy star
Carl Reiner the day before on her new ABC sitcom, "Life With Bonnie."
"It was the thrill of my life," she says breathlessly over the phone.
"Carl Reiner is perfection. The crew gave him a standing ovation. For
me, all is right in the world. This is all goodness. It's just nice
to meet these people and be in their presence and learn from them."</LD>
<LD>   That upbeat demeanor may seem hard to imagine, given that "Life
With Bonnie" has been trailing in its time period behind NBC's
"Frasier" and CBS' "The Guardian." But the network has given the
freshman comedy series a vote of confidence by picking it up for the
entire season. It also is seen in repeats Saturdays on cable's ABC
Family.</LD>
<LD>   In the family comedy, Hunt plays Bonnie Molloy, a harried
housewife and mother of three, who is the host of a morning TV talk
show in Chicago. The Reiner episode, in which the creator of "The
Dick Van Dyke Show" plays the owner of the television station, airs
this week.</LD>
<TE>   Hunt, a former nurse, created the series with Don Lake. Both have
written the episodes and Hunt is directing all but three
installments. She sees wearing several hats as really one job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just easier [to direct]. I am a storyteller, and I take
great pride in the storytelling and a great joy. I have this
incredible crew. The cameraman and I get together in the morning and
I go over what I want to see and how I want to shoot it."</TE>
<TE>   The majority of sitcoms, like "Friends" and "Will &amp; Grace," shoot
with three cameras in front of a studio audience. A few others
("Scrubs," "The Bernie Mac Show") are produced like an hourlong
series with one camera and no audience. "Life With Bonnie," though,
has a unique style.</TE>
<TE>   "We shoot Mondays and Tuesdays," says Hunt. "Mondays we shoot all
the family stuff and Tuesdays we do the talk show in front of a live
audience. Then what I do is edit the show quickly and then we have an
audience come in and we show two or three episodes in front of an
audience. That is where we get our laugh track. This is something I
wanted to try to do and nobody does. The network was nice enough to
let me do it that way, and it works out great. I get a sense of how
the episode is working and I get an honest laugh track."</TE>
<TE>   Hunt honed her comedic chops with the famed comedy troupe Second
City, in her native Chicago. After appearing as a regular on the
series "Grand" and "Davis Rules," she became the first woman to
write, produce and star in her own series, "The Building," which
appeared for just five episodes on CBS in 1993. She also wrote,
produced and starred in the 1995 CBS series "The Bonnie Hunt Show."
Though both series received generally good reviews, they failed to
attract audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Stephanie Leifer, ABC's senior vice president of comedy
series, said the network has long had its eye on Hunt.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just a few names that you always feel like that person
is a TV star," says Leifer. "They need to get into the right thing at
the right time. She is one of those people that we collectively as a
company have always admired and felt like was an ABC personality, in
our tradition of strong women. I think she's accessible and real and
she's really fun."</TE>
<TE>   Hunt and collaborator Lake first met 13 years ago while appearing
with Second City at the old Mayfair Music Hall in Santa Monica. Their
comedic sensibilities immediately clicked. Lake was a regular on "The
Building" and "The Bonnie Hunt Show" and co-wrote the romantic comedy
"Return to Me" (2000) with Hunt.</TE>
<TE>   "She's something," says Lake. "We really do enjoy storytelling,
honest to gosh. So it's fun to do a new story every week. Creatively,
it's incredibly satisfying."</TE>
<TE>   Their writing style is simple. "We have two keyboards and one
monitor," says Hunt. "We just write like we are having a
conversation. We improvise a lot of the scenes in our office and we
play all the parts, and then we sit down and write it. We work just
the way we always worked throughout our training at Second City."</TE>
<TE>   Now it's up to viewers to decide if their efforts are working.</TE>
<TE>   "Life With Bonnie" can be seen at 9 p.m. Tuesdays on ABC and 9
p.m. Saturdays on ABC Family. The network rated Tuesday's episode
TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's curious what happened to curiosity. I started wondering after I
returned from a posting in Africa some years back. Bubbling with
stories of beauty and tragedy, I'd wait for my turn in conversations.</LD>
<LD>   "Africa?" someone would interrupt. "I just saw a show on the
Discovery Channel...." The discussions would thereupon revert to the
familiar: TV, celebrities, sports, the latest fad diet or what to
wear for casual Fridays in the office.</LD>
<LD>   Later, I gained some perspective. On assignment in the Alaskan
wild among homesteading families, I received a different reaction.
When I mentioned Africa, people quieted and circled around.</LD>
<TE>   I hadn't suddenly regained the capacity to tell a tale. I had
simply wandered out of the orbit of the Information Age. That gave me
a line of sight on what all that information was costing us. Namely,
our curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   There's no surprise to saying we are over-saturated with
information in urban America. We've been struggling to tame it since
about 1970, when Alvin Toffler published "Future Shock."</TE>
<TE>   The statistics are numbing: According to various experts, urban
Americans are bombarded with 10,000 to 30,000 commercial messages
daily, plus an additional 200 or so personalized messages in the form
of telephone calls, e-mails, faxes and memos.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the daily news in whatever dosage you can
tolerate. I cannot find the clipping, but I did read that we spend
150 hours a year searching for lost information.</TE>
<TE>   What I'm aiming at is not the problem, however. It's the problem
with the solution. Ever ingenious, we respond to the assault on our
senses by deploying fine-mesh information filters. Information we
want, or need, passes through, and the remainder we disregard like
mosquitoes buzzing outside the netting.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask anyone you know in advertising. They're pulling their
hair out trying to find creative new ways to pierce our defenses.
When they discover one, we add a patch to our filters.</TE>
<TE>   What I found among homesteaders along the Arctic Circle were
people who had not yet enclosed themselves behind protective
information screens. When you're 75 miles from a road, a billboard is
still a novelty. Nature was intact, including human nature's gift of
the receptive, searching mind.</TE>
<TE>   In the city, even among friends who pride themselves on their
worldliness, the only world that reaches them is what they have
programmed their filters to recognize. Africa got shut out with the
mosquitoes.</TE>
<TE>   Although we don't dwell on the subject consciously, I think we
recognize the flaw with this survival strategy, if not yet the
remedy: deciding in advance what will be interesting and important
significantly narrows our thinking. For one thing, we reduce our
chances of serendipitous discovery, of encountering something
unexpected and wonderful, the sweet fruits of curiosity. For another,
we wind up confining our civic discussion to just a handful of
pressing social matters. Often, as a further check against overload,
we sift these down to the simplified pap of sloganeering.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the elections upon us, we kick ourselves for the
self-defeating consequences. Another campaign has passed without real
debate and only formulaic discussion of ... well, take your pick from
a dusty ledger-book of topics that should ignite our passions, stir
our imaginations and surely appeal to the curiosity of a people who
have empowered themselves to set the course of their own governance.</TE>
<TE>   No need to wander all the way to Africa either. We can look in the
mirror at something as urgent as the health system: At least 41
million Americans lack medical insurance.</TE>
<TE>   That's 50% of the total expected to vote Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency rooms, already the shame of many communities, are
threatened with closure. Nurses are in short supply. Doctors are
again cutting off Medicare patients as unprofitable. Our blood supply
depends on the willingness of the destitute. The deregulatory
fundamentalists have left our food supply dangerously vulnerable to
contamination. The national public health system is still unprepared
for the terrorist attacks that we are told are certain to come. If
gasoline was rising in price as fast as health insurance premiums,
we'd be paying $5.30 a gallon in just a few years.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, but speaking of health care, did you watch "ER" on Thursday,
when that patient had a flesh-eating infection?</TE>

<HD>Great Latino Hope Is the One Bright Spot for the GOP</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frank del Olmo</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Republican Party's prospects in Tuesday's election look pretty
bleak. Most public opinion polls indicate that the only gubernatorial
candidate more unpopular than Democrat Gray Davis is the GOP's rookie
candidate, Bill Simon.</LD>
<LD>   Little wonder, then, that Republican activists are already looking
elsewhere on the GOP ticket for hopeful prospects. And the brightest
is a young attorney from the San Gabriel Valley named Gary Mendoza.</LD>
<LD>   He's running against Democrat John Garamendi for state insurance
commissioner, a controversial post whose last elected incumbent,
Chuck Quackenbush, was forced to resign because of a political
scandal.</LD>
<TE>   That fact alone guarantees that the job will be a political hot
seat for the next four years, no matter who wins it.</TE>
<TE>   But when things go as badly as they have lately for the California
GOP, you look for hope wherever you can find it. Especially when he
also happens to be a Great Latino Hope.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza is a Mexican American from Temple City who graduated from
Claremont McKenna College and Yale Law School. He worked for a couple
of major Los Angeles law firms, served for two years as then-Gov.
Pete Wilson's state corporations commissioner and was deputy mayor
for economic development under then-Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   He came through the stints in public service with high marks for
honesty and effectiveness. Mendoza is citing his public service as
evidence that he can handle any difficulties the next insurance
commissioner will face.</TE>
<TE>   Past government experience is Garamendi's strong suit. He was a
state legislator and California's first elected insurance
commissioner, leaving the post in 1994 to run unsuccessfully for
governor.</TE>
<TE>   Most polls show Garamendi leading. But enough of them show Mendoza
within striking distance that the state GOP kicked $1.2 million into
Mendoza's campaign last week.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing is definitely winnable," Mendoza says. And he is fully
aware what a top-level Latino officeholder could mean for the
California GOP: "If I'm successful, we can reposition the party."</TE>
<TE>   That's Mendoza's polite way of saying he could help pull
California Republicans back from the abyss.</TE>
<TE>   The California GOP has teetered on the edge of political
irrelevance since 1996. That is when thousands of newly naturalized
Latino citizens began showing up at the polls to vent their anger at
Republicans for the harshly anti-Latino tone of the campaign that
Wilson ran in 1994, when he focused his reelection bid on Proposition
187, the initiative that would have denied education and other public
services to illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza opposed Proposition 187 and, like a handful of farsighted
Republicans, tried to dissuade Wilson from hitching his political
star to a dubious initiative that was eventually nullified by a
federal court as unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   But Mendoza is only the latest GOP leader to try to "reposition"
the party with a Latino electorate that continues to grow and
continues to vote heavily for Democrats. The record so far is
decidedly mixed.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush made a strong appeal for Latino support in 2000,
but even his respectable showing of 35% to 40% among Latino voters
nationwide got the national GOP back to only the levels of Latino
support that it had under popular Republicans like President Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Riordan made his appeal to a broad range of
non-Republican voters, including Latinos, part of his campaign for
the GOP gubernatorial nomination. He lost when the GOP's rank and
file opted for the more conservative Simon.</TE>
<TE>   And even Simon flirted briefly with a campaign that would appeal
to Latinos, running ads on Spanish-language television stations. But
whatever goodwill those ads may have created for his campaign was
effectively nullified when Simon, in the latest of many inept
campaign moves, hauled Wilson out of the GOP closet for a last-minute
endorsement. That may win Simon a few more right-wing votes. But not
enough to offset the Latino votes it will lose him now that the
ever-opportunistic Davis campaign is making large photos of Simon
with Wilson the centerpiece of its final Spanish-language advertising
blitz.</TE>
<TE>   So Mendoza is not only the GOP's Great Latino Hope; he may be its
only hope.</TE>

<HD>No Great L.A. Poets? Every Barfly in Town Knows Bukowski</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Press</AU>
<BD>Bill Press is co-host of MSNBC's "Buchanan and Press."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush has finally taken all this war talk one step too far.
Now he's declared war on Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Bush didn't attack L.A. himself. He delegated the dirty work to
one of his lieutenants: poet Danny Gioia, Bush's nominee for chairman
of the National Endowment for the Arts.</LD>
<LD>   A writer of well-crafted but mundane poems, Gioia came out firing
right after his nomination. Speaking to reporters, Bush's pet poet
said he had been misquoted in the Los Angeles Times last fall as
saying that no great poet ever came out of California. It wasn't
California that was lacking; it was Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is perhaps the only great city in the world that has
not yet produced a great poet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This is war! And this is wrong. Hasn't he ever heard of Charles
Bukowski?</TE>
<TE>   No poet anywhere -- not Whitman and New York, not Baudelaire and
Paris -- is so identified with his hometown as Bukowski is with Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Germany in 1920, he came to L.A. when he was 3 and stayed
until his death in 1994. He attended Los Angeles High School and L.A.
City College. He worked in the railroad yards and the downtown post
office. He lived in the seedier part of Hollywood and later in San
Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   Bukowski published more than 45 books of poetry and prose, mostly
with the upstart, now defunct, Black Sparrow Press of Santa Rosa.
Three books were published posthumously, and five more are in the
works from a division of HarperCollins. The first, due in January, is
"Sifting Through the Madness, for the Word, the Line, the Way." Like
all his earlier work, it is punctuated with references to place, from
Glendale to Hermosa Beach; from the Baldwin Hills to Beverly Hills;
from Malibu to the L.A. River.</TE>
<TE>   He captures mood and madness, as in his bleak, honest picture of
Venice Beach: "the lost and the damned / the wounded and the
intellectual / the boozed and the debauched / the negative and the
uninspired / and the police / and the police / and the police."</TE>
<TE>   He recalls a Beverly Hills moment that could have happened today:
"I feel very strange, very odd / that we are sitting at this table /
spread with an immaculate white tablecloth / with all the successful
people sitting here with us / with the war about to start tomorrow /
or next week / as we sit over wine and coffee / on a beautiful, clear
day in Beverly Hills."</TE>
<TE>   He sums up the insanity of the morning commute: "the freeways are
a psychological entanglement of warped souls / dying flowers in the
dying hour of the dying day.... what you see on the freeway is just
what there is / a funeral procession of the dead / the greatest
horror of our time in motion / see you there tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   He reminds us that Los Angeles is the city of unlimited
opportunity, but what we make of it matters: "Nobody can save you but
yourself /and you're worth saving.... maintain your self / with humor
and grace / and finally / if necessary / wager your life as you
struggle / damn the odds, damn the price. / Only you can save
yourself / do it! do it!"</TE>
<TE>   Who much cares whether Danny Gioia wins Senate confirmation? It
does matter, though, that Bukowski is the great poet of Los Angeles.
He belonged to Los Angeles, and Los Angeles belongs to him.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Must Open the Eyes of an Insular Giant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Savitt and Bei Ling</AU>
<BD>Bei Ling is a poet and literary editor in forced exile
from China. Scott Savitt, managing editor of the University of
California Press magazine Contexts, has written extensively from
China.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Chinese proverb cautions that two people can share the same bed and
have different dreams. This describes the U.S.-China relationship
even as another glacial shift of power begins in Beijing.</LD>
<LD>   The United States has clearly stated its dream for China: "The
U.S. desires the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous
China," the recently released National Security Strategy says, with
the clear caveat that "the democratic development of China is crucial
to that future."</LD>
<LD>   Chinese leader Jiang Zemin and the overwhelming majority of his
1.3 billion subjects fervently share President Bush's hope for a
strong, peaceful and prosperous China. But Jiang -- who steps down
Friday as Communist Party chief -- and his fellow Communist leaders
view democracy as more an irksome obstacle than a prerequisite of
strength and prosperity.</LD>
<TE>   China's dream is a darker one, full of resentment and suspicion
fueled by state-run media. Chairman Mao's dictate that power derives
equally from the pen and the gun is still prominent in the minds of
China's leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet has made some inroads, but it is extensively blocked.
The small areas of loosening at the periphery only blur a traditional
emphasis on ideology, unified thinking and an ominous mythology of
national martyrdom.</TE>
<TE>   It is not widely enough realized in the West that most Chinese
derived satisfaction at the events of 9/11, seeing them as just
deserts for the United States' serial international "interference" --
a chief theme of incessant xenophobic propaganda in the state-run
media. And almost no Chinese citizen believes that the 1998 U.S.
bombing of China's Embassy in Yugoslavia, killing four Chinese
citizens, was an accident.</TE>
<TE>   It has been more than 20 years since Deng Xiaoping launched
China's economic liberalization and opening to the outside world. The
resulting material gains are clear for the world to see.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the party's grip on power is arguably stronger than ever, and
no more transparent. Jiang's handover of party leadership to Hu
Jintao, for instance, does not mean he is relinquishing power.</TE>
<TE>   Most Chinese do not believe that this system can be reformed
exclusively from within. Democratization in China -- a process that
was progressing rapidly before the 1989 military crackdown on
pro-democracy protests -- can revive only with the active support of
the international community .</TE>
<TE>   The logical vehicle is the World Trade Organization. China prizes
its membership. Previously closed and protected industries, including
finance, energy, telecommunications, agriculture, information
technology and transportation, are opening up because the WTO
demanded it, not because the party leadership thought it a good idea.
The most notable exception is the market for ideas.</TE>
<TE>   The United States' $10-billion-a-month trade deficit with China
provides plenty of leverage to change that. The U.S. previously
exacted China's commitment to allow 50% foreign ownership of Internet
companies as part of its WTO accession agreement. The catch is that
China requires all Internet companies to sign a self-censorship
agreement to prevent "harmful" content, and it reserves the right to
block access to any site, as it did recently with the search engine
Google.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, China's state-run media are permitted to broadcast
freely in the United States. Recent research also documents the
Chinese government's growing influence over Chinese-language media in
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   It's a fundamentally lopsided arrangement that denies the Chinese
people news and views from the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. should insist on not only the repeal of all arbitrary
censorship of the Internet as required by China's WTO commitment, but
on opening China's print, radio and television industries, at least
to the extent that the U.S. industry is open to China. Beijing would
-- as with its WTO commitments -- have no reasonable grounds to deny
equal, reciprocal market access. This would liberate a moderating
social force more influential than all the other market openings.</TE>
<TE>   In this era of violently clashing worldviews, the democratic world
cannot afford bedmates with dramatically opposing dreams.</TE>

<HD>A Security Gap at U.S. Ports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shipping containers reaching to the sky blot out views of the ocean
on Terminal Island, heart of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.
Inside each are 15 or more tons of copying machines and pajamas,
dolls and televisions from virtually every port on the globe. And
what else?</LD>
<LD>   The mass of scraped and dented red, blue and green metal boxes
waiting to be set by cranes on the rail cars or 18-wheelers that will
carry them into America's cities is greater than usual because of
shipping lines' 10-day lockout of port workers that ended more than
three weeks ago. That closure damaged the national economy. But a new
report from a high-powered panel concludes that the stacked
containers also are emblematic of a greater danger -- the nation's
failure to adequately prepare for another terrorist attack more than
a year after 9/11.</LD>
<LD>   Six months before hijackers seized four aircraft, former Sens.
Gary Hart, a Democrat, and Warren B. Rudman, a Republican, warned
that terrorists were likely to strike on American soil and that the
country was unprepared.</LD>
<TE>   This year they were joined on a panel by two former secretaries of
State and two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, plus
business executives and scientists. This group, too, is worried.</TE>
<TE>   Its report, sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, warns
that "America remains dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond
to a catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. soil." Such an attack, the
report adds, would cause "even greater casualties and widespread
disruption to American lives and the economy." Add another war with
Iraq and the threat that Saddam Hussein would try to use chemical or
biological weapons in America, and the group concludes that the need
for action is more urgent still.</TE>
<TE>   The panel members aren't alone in trying quietly to bring
attention to this alarming vulnerability. CIA Director George J.
Tenet recently advised Congress that Al Qaeda "intends to strike us
both here and overseas." The new Hart-Rudman report prods the federal
government to share its anti-terror intelligence with local and state
police. It urges better training of police, fire and emergency
medical personnel in responding to chemical or biological attacks and
proposes that Congress give more money to National Guard units to
support homeland security plans drawn up by the states.</TE>
<TE>   One of the report's more striking findings is how pathetically
little money the government spends addressing the potentially
debilitating flaws in port security. Screening of airport passengers
and their luggage costs about $200 million  a month and will go even
higher when airports begin X-raying all checked baggage. Compare that
with the federal government's initial appropriation last year of just
$93 million, later supplemented by $125 million, for security at more
than 300 U.S. ports around the country. For the year.</TE>
<TE>   The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach handle 43% of the maritime
containers coming into this country. After 9/11, the two sought $70
million in federal grants for security but only got about $6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Federal agencies responsible for port security, including the
Customs Service, Coast Guard and Immigration and Naturalization
Service, recognize the extent of the problem. The Customs Service has
launched a program with governments such as Canada, Singapore, China
and the Netherlands to inspect and seal containers before they are
put aboard ships. If inspectors in the United States find that
someone has tampered with the seals, they can open and search them.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 6 million containers entering the country each
year, and inspections tying up five people for three hours for a
single container, only a tiny fraction can be inspected. So someone
has to evaluate the containers and ships for danger. If shipping
companies can vouch for the contents of containers before they leave
port and technology can determine whether a shipment has been
diverted to a suspicious location before resuming its journey, the
risk can be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Shippers may have to pay more, as will the Wal-Marts and J.C.
Penneys that sell the goods. That means a higher price for consumers
as well -- a few cents more an item to minimize the danger that one
of those containers dangling from a crane in Long Beach will someday
contain a jar of anthrax or a suitcase-size nuclear bomb.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft to Face More Competitors in Future</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. largely escaped punishment in Friday's landmark court
ruling. But it has yet to be seen whether it will be so lucky in the
marketplace.</LD>
<LD>   In accepting the antitrust settlement that Microsoft had reached
with the Justice Department, U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly gave the Redmond, Wash., software giant almost
everything it was looking for. California and the eight other states
that had been pressing for stricter sanctions against the company
were rebuffed.</LD>
<LD>   Yet in many ways, the judge's ruling is moot.</LD>
<TE>   The case centered on Windows, Microsoft's flagship operating
system, which is used to run more than 90% of the world's personal
computers. The future, though, is about the Internet -- a place where
PCs are increasingly less important.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and President Steve Ballmer
long ago moved on to the new world of expanded communications and
computing over the World Wide Web.</TE>
<TE>   Before the decade is out, according to Forrester Research, more
than 14 billion devices will be programmed and operated over the
Internet -- many of them having nothing to do with PCs. Among these
gizmos: souped-up telephones, hand-held computers and even pumps for
intravenous delivery of medicines.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of devices connecting to the Internet will be more
than 25 times the number of computers today," says Maria Martinez,
president of Embrace Networks Inc., a start-up based in Sunnyvale,
Calif., that has developed software to manage the flood of signals
and devices on the expanded Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The race is on to establish standardized platforms to allow these
billions of devices to communicate and cooperate -- machines talking
to machines.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft has been working for more than two years to develop its
own platform for the business community, called .Net.</TE>
<TE>   But it is not alone. Competitors, including giant IBM Corp., have
other ideas, and they are pushing development of "open source"
systems for the expanded Internet. Such systems use computer codes
that anyone can access, so all programmers are on an equal footing.</TE>
<TE>   Many firms are working with forms of the Java computer language,
which originated with Sun Microsystems Inc. Java's "virtual machines"
are designed to run well on computers that use Microsoft Windows or
any competing operating system.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Linux operating system, which runs databases for
corporations and big institutions, is an open source technology that
is supported by IBM and other companies. It's also backed by "the
growing computer universes in China and India and other countries,"
says technologist Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the
Future, a Palo Alto think tank.</TE>
<TE>   The point is that as Microsoft moves on with evolving technology,
many others are moving on too. The company is bound to face strong
competition on all commercial battlefields in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, Microsoft is focusing its efforts on the $150-billion
market of information services for small and medium-sized companies.
In the last two years, Microsoft has spent $4 billion to acquire
software firms catering to the small-business market, including Great
Plains Software and Denmark's Navision.</TE>
<TE>   But IBM is targeting that same market. Some of the $10 billion it
has set aside for new product development is being dedicated to
adapting its big-company software products to meet the needs -- and
price ranges -- of smaller companies.</TE>
<TE>   On the consumer front, Microsoft is trying hard to increase the
market share of its MSN Internet service, where it runs a distant
second to America Online. Although Microsoft has invested heavily in
promoting MSN for five years now, it has not seen much profit from
its labors. Nor has it gained much on America Online, which has 30
million customers to MSN's 9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft doesn't win them all, but it keeps on coming, spending
heavily on research and development to better its products.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's operating system initially conquered Apple Computer
Inc.'s Macintosh desktop computer format in the 1980s, as it
persuaded IBM and other computer manufacturers to use Windows. It
then improved on Windows, partly by copying Apple's user-friendly
system of icons and mouse clicks.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft then used the leverage it had with Windows to push its
Web browser, Internet Explorer. By bundling its ubiquitous Windows
with Internet Explorer, Microsoft managed to sink rival Netscape
Navigator in the browser market -- a tactic later ruled illegal in
the long-running antitrust case.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, although Microsoft remains the nation's most valuable
company, its growth has stalled. Though revenue has increased, on
average, 12% a year, earnings have grown less than 2% annually since
1999. Microsoft stock, which trades on Nasdaq, now sells for less
than half its all-time high reached three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   With the judge's decision Friday, it is certain that Microsoft
won't be broken up as Standard Oil once was. Yet the sheer enormity
of changes coming in technology means that the company won't dominate
the Internet future as it did the personal computing past.</TE>
<TE>   The juggernaut rolls on -- but there will be more bumps in the
road than ever before.</TE>

<HD>Icahn Just Can't Pass Up a Deal</HD>
<DH>The billionaire investor still is stirring debate over the
tactics he uses in the pursuit of profit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Customers swear by the steaks at the upscale Morton's of Chicago
restaurants. But that hardly explains why investor Carl Icahn, who
has waged financial war for two decades with the giants of Corporate
America, fought a months-long contest this year to buy a chain with
just 65 locations around the country.</LD>
<LD>   In losing another suitor, Icahn walked away with just less than $1
million in profit on his Morton's stock -- pocket change for someone
whose net worth, according to Forbes magazine, is $5.8 billion.</LD>
<LD>   So why would Icahn, now 66, spend time and energy jousting for
such a small prize?</LD>
<TE>   Some say it's because Icahn was personally motivated in this case;
a family acquaintance had made an earlier offer for Morton's with
backing from Icahn.</TE>
<TE>   But the larger reason is that the size of the gain no longer
matters to him.</TE>
<TE>   More than a decade after he became fabulously rich and famous --
some say infamous -- as a top corporate raider in the 1980s and '90s,
Icahn still is battling CEOs, other investors and the changing tides
of financial markets simply for sport. In doing so, he keeps alive
the debate over whether his actions ultimately benefit companies,
their employees and their investors by challenging a firm's
management and efficiency, or whether his deal-making wreaks
unnecessary havoc for those caught in his pursuit of profit.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, "I just enjoy doing it ... a good deal," Icahn said in
an interview, adding that he has no plans to stop. "It's an
intellectual challenge to get it done right."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's buying cheap stocks and bonds of a distressed
company, shorting inflated stocks or launching yet another hostile
bid for a business, New York-based Icahn focuses on unearthing hidden
value.</TE>
<TE>   Savvy, tenacious and ruthless once he fixes on a target, Icahn
cares little whether his investments are perceived as sexy or dull.</TE>
<TE>   Making money is what counts -- not because he needs it, but to
keep score.</TE>
<TE>   "He really does like the struggle," said Wilbur Ross, head of
investment banker W.L. Ross &amp; Co. in New York, who has been both an
ally and opponent of Icahn's various deals over 20 years. "He's a
brilliant guy, and he's also the most competitive person I know, bar
none."</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Teddy Forstmann, one of the nation's most successful
investors. Two weeks ago, a group led by his firm, Forstmann Little &amp;
Co., ceded control of Reston, Va.-based XO Communications Inc. to
Icahn after a battle that lasted for months. Icahn mounted his bid
for the ailing provider of phone and Internet services to businesses
after buying about $500 million of XO's bank debt.</TE>
<TE>   Forstmann won't comment publicly on his tussle with Icahn. The
fight nonetheless illustrates how Icahn is starting to exploit the
meltdown of the telecommunications industry.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still bearish on the stock market in general," Icahn said.
"But there are certain industries that have opportunities such as
telecom. However, you must pick the right telecom."</TE>
<TE>   Icahn won't get more specific. His actions still move markets, and
he's not about to tip his hand. He declined to comment on reports
that he has been buying bonds of long-distance provider WorldCom
Inc., but confirmed he made a quick investment in another
scandal-plagued company, Tyco International Ltd., and then sold it
for an unspecified gain. Icahn also bought a big chunk of bonds in
auto parts maker Federal-Mogul Corp., which is in bankruptcy
proceedings and facing asbestos-related litigation.</TE>
<TE>   There's also recurring speculation that Icahn will buy another
company in Las Vegas, where he's already made bets on relatively
cheap properties by purchasing control of the Stratosphere and the
Arizona Charlie's hotel-casinos. He also controls the Sands Hotel &amp;
Casino in Atlantic City, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   But Icahn, true to form, has been deliberate in Las Vegas.
Although there are other troubled properties that could be possible
targets, Icahn hasn't stepped forward. "He's very careful," said
Anthony Curtis, publisher of the Las Vegas Advisor, a newsletter that
tracks Sin City. "He'll be willing to stay where he's at before he'll
get into a bad deal."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, though, Icahn has been busy the last two years. He
emerged victorious from a bitter, five-year fight in which he pressed
RJR Nabisco Holdings to split its tobacco and food groups, a campaign
that netted him nearly $1 billion in stock profits. (The Nabisco unit
ultimately was sold to Philip Morris Cos.) As the stock market's
bubble was bursting, Icahn made a killing by heavily shorting stocks
such as AOL Time Warner Inc., Internet travel site Priceline.com and
battered insurer Conseco Inc., which now trades for pennies a share.
To short a stock is to bet that its price will fall.</TE>
<TE>   He also threatened, before changing his mind, to shake things up
at companies as big as General Motors Corp. and as small as Visx
Inc., a Santa Clara-based maker of lasers used in eye surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Through his firm American Real Estate Partners and other holdings,
Icahn also has interests in residential real estate projects and
commercial properties such as office buildings, banks and
supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Sending Shock Waves</TE>
<TE>   Icahn practically became a household name in the 1980s when, with
ample access to "junk bond" financing, he and other raiders routinely
bought stakes in companies and then threatened to launch hostile
takeover bids. The threat alone prompted some companies to buy
Icahn's interest at a fat premium to make him disappear, a practice
dubbed "greenmail."</TE>
<TE>   He merely had to announce that he had acquired 5% or more of a
corporation's stock to send shock waves through the company, its
employees and the communities where it operated. If a target opted to
resist Icahn, it sometimes laid off workers, borrowed heavily or sold
all or part of its business to boost its stock price itself. That
enabled Icahn to still cash out with a profit and move on.</TE>
<TE>   Icahn's prey included Texaco, now part of ChevronTexaco, and
Phillips Petroleum, now part of ConocoPhillips. On a few occasions he
actually bought the company. One was Trans World Airlines (now part
of AMR Corp.), and he still owns ACF Industries, a New York-based
rail-car leasing concern.</TE>
<TE>   To many people caught in his raids, Icahn was capitalism gone
insane; he personified the "greed is good" mentality they saw
pervading Wall Street. Managements and labor unions found common
ground in accusing him of sparking massive layoffs and damaging local
economies. The criticism was especially pointed at some of the
companies he acquired and managed, such as TWA.</TE>
<TE>   Icahn, who now risks his own cash and seldom borrows, still
alienates many of the people involved with the companies he roils.
"His very presence in the situation was extraordinarily unsettling
for the employees and bad for morale," said the top executive at one
of Icahn's recent targets, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so
as not to tangle with Icahn further.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an individual who has a value system that is totally
different than mine," the executive said. "I never enjoy making money
primarily at other people's disadvantage."</TE>
<TE>   But untold numbers of other stockholders who invested in Icahn's
targets also have made money as he has pushed share prices higher.
Icahn is defensive about the criticism -- he has always bristled at
the term "raider" -- but ultimately is unmoved. Long a self-described
advocate of all shareholders, Icahn points to RJR Nabisco, Texaco and
other stock plays as evidence of how he created wealth not only for
himself but also for others by forcing the companies to restructure.</TE>
<TE>   Icahn long has railed against entrenched executives at many public
companies for poor management and wasteful spending on themselves
while doing little to help stockholders. Icahn's wealth, power and
tough bargaining tactics often diluted the effect of his message, but
he still complains about sleepy managements and their expensive
perks.</TE>
<TE>   "While there are many good managers, there are still too many bad
ones," he said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Ross, the investment banker, said Icahn's views have been
bolstered by this year's corporate scandals, which exposed lax
oversight by directors and lavish lifestyles for executives at Tyco,
WorldCom, Enron Corp., Global Crossing Ltd. and Adelphia
Communications Corp. while those companies were collapsing. "This is
what Carl has been very much a champion against for a very long
time," Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   Med School to Wall St.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Celian Icahn was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in the
New York borough of Queens. His mother was a school teacher, his
father a lawyer, teacher and cantor at the local synagogue. The
younger Icahn received a degree in philosophy from Princeton
University in 1957 (he still drops quotes from the likes of
Aristotle). Then he tried medical school at New York University, but
dropped out after three years.</TE>
<TE>   He migrated to Wall Street in the early 1960s, founding Icahn &amp;
Co. in 1968 after some years of struggle. At first, he primarily
speculated on takeover situations, or what's called risk arbitrage.
But as the years went by, Icahn increasingly took an active role in
pressuring companies to change to spur their stock prices higher.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the 1980s, the unleashing of merger mania and the onset
of the corporate raider.</TE>
<TE>   The moniker seems faded today. At their zenith, Icahn and other
raiders such as T. Boone Pickens excelled at making quick profits
and, despite their threats, had little interest in running most of
the companies they targeted. But the attacks became more difficult as
companies staggered directors' board terms, adopted "poison pill"
shareholder-rights plans and installed other anti-takeover measures.</TE>
<TE>   So Icahn began digging in against his foes. As he proved in the
RJR Nabisco and TWA cases, and more recently with XO Communications,
he's now prepared to spend months or years to win.</TE>
<TE>   But he doesn't always win. His investment in former U.S. Steel
Corp. parent USX Corp. produced only scant profit in the early 1990s.
Icahn also was roundly criticized for doing a poor job when he ran
TWA, which entered bankruptcy proceedings under his watch in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, though, Icahn steered clear of the insider-trading
scandals in the 1980s that snared such deal makers as Ivan Boesky and
Michael Milken.</TE>
<TE>   Icahn, who remarried after a 1999 divorce and has two grown
children, guards his privacy and donates millions of dollars to
charity with little fanfare. He has given to hospitals, universities
and opened a temporary home for single mothers and their children in
the Bronx. Near that shelter, he also is spending $4 million for a
new charter school, because he's a strong advocate of privatizing
grade-school education.</TE>
<TE>   He sometimes can be spotted making sports bets in Las Vegas, is an
avid tennis player, breeds racehorses in Kentucky and collects rare
paintings. But he prefers reading or watching movies at home to the
cocktail-party circuit. While staying at his summer home in East
Hampton, N.Y., "it's not at all unusual to see just Carl, Gail (his
second wife) and his son having dinner together," Ross said. "He is a
very private person."</TE>
<TE>   As a player in the markets, though, Icahn probably will remain in
the public eye for years to come, Ross predicted. "I don't think
there's any reason why he would stop," Ross said, noting that another
billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, 72, still is active.</TE>
<TE>   "Investing is one of the few activities that you can really
continue, as long as the mind is as alert as Carl's," Ross said. "And
he's more alert than most 35-year-olds."</TE>

<LD>It's not surprising that SBC Communications Inc.'s Ed Whitacre isn't
exactly delighted with the current state of affairs in telecom ("For
SBC's Chairman, a Distance to Go," Oct. 28).</LD>
<LD>   That's because his company is starting to face the kind of
competition the 1996 Telecommunications Act envisioned. And like any
good monopolist, he doesn't like it.</LD>
<LD>   SBC's efforts to push network connection charges for competitors
well above retail rates is a desperate and anti-consumer reaction to
the development of meaningful local competition in the state. The
truth is that the rates approved by state regulators guarantee a
profit for SBC.</LD>
<TE>   Clearly, SBC's game is to maintain its monopoly over local phone
service in total disregard for the law requiring it to open the
market to competition before getting into long-distance.</TE>

dropped by 6%.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, SBC's revenue may have taken a minor dip, but it's the
economy. We're in a recession.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, SBC is making money hand over fist in California. It made
$1.8 billion this quarter, and California is its most profitable
division, with return on investment exceeding 30%. What other company
can claim the same?</TE>
<TE>   A 6% loss of revenue? It sounds like they're doing just fine.</TE>

<TE>   This is not about bottom-line profit, this is about fair business
practices on the part of the other phone companies, which for years
have used the phone lines that were built and that are maintained by
SBC.</TE>
<TE>   The simple fact of the matter here is that if the other companies
are going to use or lease those lines, then the maintenance and
upgrade costs should be billed to them or included in the amount that
they are paying to SBC to use those lines.</TE>

<LD>It was deeply upsetting to see how you treated A Glimmer of Hope, the
family foundation that funds and supports humanitarian projects in
Ethiopia, in "Donations Dried Up With Tech Stocks" (Oct. 13).</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to the damaging impression created by your article, our
pledge of $100 million to the foundation has been honored and grants
of $6 million have been made over the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   The article failed to report that our family gifted 4.45 million
shares of Charles Schwab stock. At the time of Schwab's CyBerCorp
acquisition, in March 2000, the Schwab stock was valued at $25 per
share, so the stock donated was valued at $110 million. Schwab, along
with the stock market, has subsequently declined, and the present
value of our foundation's capital fund is $57 million.</LD>
<TE>   We view this as a substantial amount of capital that is now fully
diversified and invested to grow over the long term, and it continues
to generate funding for a robust grants program.</TE>

<HD>Early Distributions From IRA Can Be Penalty-Free</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Liz Pulliam Weston</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I am 56 and will retire in January after 36 years with an
auto company. I would like to start taking equal monthly payments
from my individual retirement account but was told I couldn't do this
without incurring a 10% penalty because I am not at least 59 1/2. I
thought the IRS had changed its rules on this issue, or am I
incorrect?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Boy, did you get bad advice, and twice over.</LD>
<LD>   Because you will be at least 55 at the time you are "separated
from service" (which, in IRS-speak, means you quit or are fired, laid
off or retired), no penalty will apply to your IRA withdrawals.
You'll still have to pay income tax on the money, of course.</LD>
<TE>   But even if you weren't 55, you could avoid the penalty by taking
equal monthly payments from your IRA based on your life expectancy.</TE>
<TE>   This is nothing new. What changed was the way the IRS allows you
to calculate those payments. The tax agency essentially updated its
mortality tables, allowing people to take smaller distributions from
their retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   You can find out more about tapping your retirement fund from the
latest edition of "IRAs, 401(k)s &amp; Other Retirement Plans: Taking
Your Money Out" by Twila Slesnick and John C. Suttle (Nolo Press,
2002). The IRS also has information on its Web site at www.irs.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Do make sure before tapping your funds early that your IRA won't
run out of money before you run out of life.</TE>
<TE>   Once you take this money out, you can't put it back, and you're
losing the tax-deferred earnings you could make had you left the
retirement account alone.</TE>
<TE>   Insurer Inquiries Won't Hurt Credit</TE>
<TE>   Q: I understand that more insurers are using credit scores to make
underwriting and rating decisions. How would you suggest dealing with
the negative impact on my credit report caused when prospective
insurers look at my credit before providing me with a premium quote?</TE>
<TE>   A: You don't need to deal with the negative effect because there
probably isn't any.</TE>
<TE>   Credit scores are three-digit numbers used to evaluate your
credit-worthiness. The leading scoring formula, known as FICO,
ignores inquiries by all insurers, says Craig Watts, spokesman for
FICO creator Fair Isaac.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true of Fair Isaac's insurance risk scores, which are
used by hundreds of insurers in lieu of or in addition to credit
scores.</TE>
<TE>   This issue confuses some people because the insurers' inquiries
show up on their credit reports, which are maintained by the credit
bureaus and are used to compile FICO scores. But unlike "hard"
inquiries -- those made by lenders when you apply for credit --
inquiries made by insurers, and by you when you want to see your own
credit history, don't hurt your FICO score.</TE>
<TE>   FICO is not the only credit-scoring formula out there, and there
may be others that do not distinguish among the types of inquiries
listed on a report.</TE>
<TE>   But because the FICO score is by far the most commonly used, you
probably don't need to worry about insurance inquiries hurting your
ability to get credit.</TE>
<TE>   Deciding What to  Do With a Windfall</TE>
<TE>   Q: My husband and I just received a small inheritance. We're
unfamiliar with investments and don't know which way to turn. Can you
give us any guidance?</TE>
<TE>   A: Usually, the best use for a windfall of any kind is to pay off
debt, particularly nondeductible consumer debt such as credit cards
and car loans. Once your debt is retired, the next best course is to
make sure you have an adequate emergency fund -- three to six months'
worth of expenses is usually good.</TE>
<TE>   If you still have money left over, then you need to make a few
decisions. What's the purpose of this money? Many people focus on how
they got it -- "It was an inheritance," "I won the lottery!" -- which
is pretty much irrelevant when it comes to financial planning. What
counts is what you want to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   If you plan to use the cash in a few years for a down payment on a
house, say, or a great vacation, you'll want to keep the money safe
and liquid. Good choices would be a money market account or
certificates of deposit with varying maturity dates (with the oldest
coming due before you'll actually need the money).</TE>
<TE>   If you want this money for your retirement 30 years from now, then
you can afford to take more risk. You might want to invest it in a
diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds and cash.</TE>
<TE>   If you have no clue what you want to do, then stick it in a money
market account or savings account until you make up your mind.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, pick up a good book on investing such as Eric Tyson's
"Investing for Dummies" and educate yourselves so you'll have a
better idea of the course you should take once you decide what you
want this money to do for you.</TE>

<KH>THE MICROSOFT DECISION</KH>
<HD>Jury Is Still Out on Judge's Performance</HD>
<DH>Her ruling in the landmark antitrust case could propel
Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to legal stardom -- or infamy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jube Shiver Jr.</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The antitrust case against software titan Microsoft Corp. is the kind
that can make or break a legal career. So in the wake of federal
jurist Colleen Kollar-Kotelly's ruling Friday, many observers are
trying to answer the question: How will the judge be judged?</LD>
<LD>   The 4-year-old dispute already has blemished two of her colleagues
who presided over the proceedings. Both former U.S. District Judge
Stanley Sporkin and current U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson were very publicly booted off the case by an appeals court
that reprimanded them for inappropriate behavior outside the
courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   Now legal experts are debating how history will view U.S. District
Judge Kollar-Kotelly, who on Friday approved most of the provisions
of Microsoft's settlement with the Justice Department in an opinion
that quoted from such literary classics as Niccolo Machiavelli's "The
Prince" and Miguel de Cervantes' "Don Quixote."</LD>
<TE>   In her five years on the federal bench, Kollar-Kotelly had racked
up scant experience with technology or antitrust litigation before
she was randomly chosen to resolve what is widely considered the most
important business case since the breakup of Standard Oil Co. a
century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Digesting the Ruling</TE>
<TE>   She spent most of her career handling routine murder and drug
cases, along with an occasional business spat or government agency
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Her role in the Microsoft trial, some experts say, could propel
her to legal stardom -- or infamy -- once analysts have a chance to
fully digest her 344-page ruling.</TE>
<TE>   If it is seen as "a well-reasoned decision that resolves a case
that has defied solution by others, that would enhance her stature,"
said Robert H. Lande, a law professor at the University of Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts aligned with Microsoft foes wasted little time
blasting the decision. Former Supreme Court nominee Robert H. Bork
predicted it would be overturned on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly's ruling represents "a substantial abandonment of
antitrust law as it applies to one of the most important industries
in America," said Bork, who is now an attorney with ProComp, a trade
group backed by AOL Time Warner Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Few judges have seen their careers blossom as a result of handling
a single case. But there have been exceptions. U.S. District Judge
Harold H. Greene gained considerable fame for presiding over the
breakup of the Ma Bell telephone monopoly after a landmark federal
antitrust case against AT&amp;T Corp. in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly was an unlikely candidate to decide the Microsoft
case.</TE>
<TE>   Before becoming a judge, she spent 12 years working as chief legal
counsel to St. Elizabeth's Hospital, the city-run psychiatric
institution in Washington. She also worked for three years in the
Justice Department's criminal division during the Nixon
administration. President Reagan appointed her to the District of
Columbia's Superior Court in 1984, where she served for 13 years
before President Clinton elevated her to the federal bench.</TE>
<TE>   The 59-year-old jurist from New York was selected for the
Microsoft case in a courthouse lottery in 2001 from among more than a
dozen full-time U.S. district judges. Once chosen, she could have
demurred, citing her lack of antitrust experience, according to a
courthouse spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Eager to Take On Case</TE>
<TE>   But Kollar-Kotelly, a graduate of Catholic University of America
School of Law, appeared eager to take on the case. In a depressed
stock market, she sold tens of thousand of dollars' worth of stock in
International Business Machines Corp. and other technology companies
whose fortunes might be affected by her verdict in order to avoid any
conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   She also persevered despite criticism that her husband's work
could present a conflict of interest. Washington attorney John T.
Kotelly represented Microsoft archrival Corel Corp. in the 1990s.
Kollar-Kotelly has said her husband had only limited involvement with
the Canadian software company and ended his representation in 2000.
Therefore, she said, she was not required to recuse herself from the
Microsoft case.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly has conducted a painstaking and methodical
examination of the Microsoft case during a nearly 3-month-long trial
and five months of deliberation, going so far as to carry files home
and phone lawyers at odd hours to ask questions.</TE>
<TE>   Is a Higher Court Next?</TE>
<TE>   The Microsoft case certainly is the most high-profile matter that
Kollar-Kotelly has handled since she became a judge. It's also the
type of case that could land her on the federal appellate court or on
the lecture circuit, presuming her opinion is upheld by higher
courts.</TE>
<TE>   "She's quite happy being on the District Court, but I think she'd
make a very good appellate court judge," said Mike Madigan, a
prominent Washington attorney and friend of Kollar-Kotelly's since
their law school days.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly was highly regarded before she took on the
Microsoft case.</TE>
<TE>   "Experience in mental health issues might have put her on the map,
but Kollar-Kotelly excels in virtually every type of case," according
to a 1996 article in a local city magazine called the Washingtonian.
"On the bench she is all business, extremely organized and
efficient."</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues echo the observations today and add that
Kollar-Kotelly's legal acumen, persuasive skills and relative lack of
experience may have made her the perfect candidate to preside over
the Microsoft case.</TE>
<TE>   "People overstate the challenge" of hearing an antitrust case,
said Sporkin, who is now in private practice in Washington. "There is
a lot of complexity in the law, period. But she is a very competent
judge -- decisive and smart as hell."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to deliberating cases, of course, judges tend to
care more about how their opinions are received by the appellate
courts than the court of public opinion. "Judges do not like to be
reversed on appeal," said Andy Gavil, an antitrust expert and law
professor at Howard University in Washington. "She wants to write an
appeal-proof decision."</TE>
<TE>   Such an outcome would stand in sharp contrast to the fallout that
accompanied the antitrust rulings of previous Microsoft judges
Sporkin and Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Sporkin was removed from the case by the U.S. Court of Appeals
after he rejected a proposed 1995 out-of-court settlement as being
too soft on the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant.</TE>
<TE>   Sporkin said his ruling was informed, in part, by a book on the
computer industry called "Hard Drive" that his son gave him to read.
The appeals court ruled his extracurricular reading was improper,
although other judges have been known to read outside materials when
they are hearing cases.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, Jackson was yanked from the case after it was
revealed that he granted interviews to journalists and authors while
conducting the trial. In those question-and-answer sessions, Jackson
likened Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates to Napoleon and compared
company executives to gangland killers.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's controversial remarks prompted the appeals court to
throw out his sweeping ruling to break up Microsoft into two
companies.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court also criticized Jackson for not gathering any
evidence about possible remedies before concluding that Microsoft
should be broken up as punishment for illegally protecting its
monopoly for Windows, its flagship operating system for personal
computers.</TE>

<HD>Withdrawal Rules Are an Added Torment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As bad as the long bear market has been for most investors, the steep
decline in stock prices holds special torment for retirees with
savings in tax-deferred retirement accounts.</LD>
<LD>   And they can thank Uncle Sam for the added pain.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. tax rules require retirees to begin withdrawing money from
their tax-deferred savings plans -- such as individual retirement
accounts and 401(k) and 403(b) plans -- after they reach age 70 1/2.
The withdrawals must occur whether or not a retiree needs the cash.</LD>
<TE>   The idea is to make sure retirees pay tax on at least some of the
money before they die. Hence, the minimum annual withdrawal
percentages are smaller for younger retirees and larger for older
ones.</TE>
<TE>   But when the government wrote the rules in the late 1970s, the
assumption may have been that assets in retirement accounts would
grow in value most years, preventing relatively small mandatory
withdrawals from draining accounts too quickly.</TE>
<TE>   That assumption didn't allow for an era in which the stock market
has fallen for two consecutive years and is poised to make it three
in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Retirees Are Worried</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Shearer of Orange knows just how painful the rules can be.
Shearer, 70, must start withdrawing money from his tax-deferred
retirement plans this year. And under Internal Revenue Service
requirements, the amount he is forced to withdraw is based on the
value of his account at the end of last year -- when it was worth
about 40% more than it is now, after 10 months of losses.</TE>
<TE>   If Shearer were able to base withdrawals on a more current
balance, he would be able to leave thousands of dollars more in his
tax-deferred accounts. That would reduce his current income tax bill
and give his savings more time to recover from the market's losses.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is being hit," Shearer said. "It's really an irritation
that you can't account for that."</TE>
<TE>   Retirees such as Shearer, who had a significant portion of his
savings in stocks, are learning firsthand just how the withdrawal
rules can drain a retirement account in an extended bear market.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a retiree who reached the age of required withdrawals
three years ago, and whose tax-deferred account was fully invested in
a Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index mutual fund worth $100,000 when the
market began to slide, would have been forced to withdraw $9,816 from
savings over the last three years -- while his retirement account
balance plunged from $100,000 to about $55,000.</TE>
<TE>   If the retiree had been allowed to make withdrawals at the end of
each year based on the then-current account balance, the required
withdrawals would have been as much as $1,600 less.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, the biggest hit retirees are taking is from market
losses, not mandatory withdrawals. However, mandatory withdrawals do
two things: They force the retiree to make paper losses real by
selling securities, and they require that tax be paid on the amount
withdrawn at ordinary income tax rates.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the government revamped rules to help early retirees
-- those younger than 59 1/2 -- who were suffering with the same
problem. The new rules allow early retirees taking regular payments
from retirement plans to calculate their mandatory withdrawals based
on more up-to-date portfolio values.</TE>
<TE>   But once they set a new date to figure the proper withdrawal
amount, they must stick with that date each year in calculating the
account's value and their withdrawals.</TE>
<TE>   Rules for 70 1/2 or Older</TE>
<TE>   Retirees age 70 1/2 or older, however, still are required to use
portfolio calculations from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   One reason the government can't cut older retirees a break:
Mandatory distribution rules for those older than 70 were revamped
earlier this year to require that retirement plan administrators --
the mutual fund firms and other investment companies that hold IRA
and other defined contribution balances -- calculate mandatory
distributions for their customers.</TE>
<TE>   That makes it much easier for the IRS to match the amount retirees
are supposed to withdraw with what they actually declared in taxable
income for a given year. For simplicity's sake, the IRS wants a set
date for that calculation, and the natural choice was year's end.</TE>
<TE>   There has been some movement in Congress to find other ways to
address the effect of the stock market's slide on retirement savings
and withdrawal rates. The solution that has the most support is a
simple one: raise the age at which retirees must start making
withdrawals from 70 1/2to 75.</TE>
<TE>   "Our legislation is designed to help retirees and near-retirees
who have been hurt the most by the downturn in the stock market,"
said Rep. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), one of the main sponsors of a bill to
boost the withdrawal age. "By raising the age, we are making sure
that workers can hold on to their assets for a longer period of
time."</TE>
<TE>   However, tax experts said the bill's chances appear slim, partly
because of federal budget shortfalls and partly because there are
more pressing issues for legislators to address.</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, if the stock market manages to continue its
recovery in 2003, the current withdrawal rules might benefit retirees
for the same reason that they're hurting them now: Next year's
withdrawal calculations would be based on this year's depressed
balances.</TE>

<HD>A Picture Deal's Life</HD>
<DH>The future of Disney's partnership with Pixar, which has
yielded a string of animated hits and hundreds of millions in
profits, remains uncertain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Eller and Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mood was jovial as Walt Disney Co. chief Michael Eisner and his
guest, Pixar Animation Studios head Steve Jobs, watched Game 5 of the
World Series from a luxury box at Pac Bell Park in San Francisco.
Sitting side by side, the two men laughed together, bantering and
talking baseball.</LD>
<LD>   For the moment, it seemed, both were on the same team.</LD>
<LD>   But behind the lighthearted atmosphere, away from the playing
field, the two industry titans are locked in their own kind of
Hollywood gamesmanship, with hundreds of millions of dollars riding
on the outcome.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a question of who's going to blink first," said Merrill
Lynch analyst Andrew Slabin.</TE>
<TE>   During the last decade, Burbank-based Disney and Pixar have forged
one of the industry's most successful partnerships. They have made a
string of revolutionary computer-animated hits -- "Toy Story," "Toy
Story 2," "A Bug's Life" and most recently "Monsters, Inc." Three
more are coming under an agreement that gives both companies an even
split of the profits.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for Disney is that, along the way, Pixar has gone from
rookie to superstar.</TE>
<TE>   With an impeccable track record and a strong balance sheet of
nearly $300 million in cash, Jobs has made it clear to Hollywood and
Wall Street that he will begin entertaining offers from rival studios
early next year and could potentially part ways with Disney. If he
chooses to stay with Disney, he will push for a deal that would give
Pixar all the profits and pay Disney only a distribution fee to
release its movies, according to sources close to Jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, Disney's movie earnings could take a substantial hit,
underscoring just how dependent the studio has become on Pixar in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has reaped nearly $500 million in profits from the Pixar
movies from 1998 to 2001, accounting for an estimated 45% of the
studio's operating income in that period, according to a recent
report by Prudential Securities. Over that same time, Disney's own
animation unit produced such box-office disappointments as "Atlantis:
The Lost Empire" and "The Emperor's New Groove" and retrenched by
slashing hundreds of jobs and salaries. It was only this summer that
Disney scored with its own hit, "Lilo &amp; Stitch."</TE>
<TE>   Disney's relationship with Pixar, which is uncertain beyond 2005,
has attracted increasing scrutiny as investors grow impatient with
Disney's financial struggles, particularly at its ABC television
network and theme parks. Eisner has been under heavy pressure from
powerful board members and shareholders to boost Disney's stock
price, which has been pummeled in the last two years. Disney shares
were up 33 cents at $17.03 in New York Stock Exchange trading on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   No Discussions Yet</TE>
<TE>   So far, Disney and Pixar are not negotiating, prompting some
analysts to question whether Eisner is moving too slowly on an
arrangement that is so vital to his company.</TE>
<TE>   "To lose [Pixar] would be a huge strategic blow and a financial
blow for Disney," said Paul Kim, an analyst with Kaufman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Pixar's enviable success streak appears to give it the upper hand
in negotiating any new deal. Under the current contract, Pixar
produces the movies and Disney markets and distributes them. The two
evenly share costs and profits. In addition, Disney gets a
distribution fee that averages 12.5% of a movie's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Pixar needs Disney, analysts say. Pixar would be
hard-pressed to find another partner with the brand name, marketing
muscle and global reach in family entertainment that has made Disney
an industry leader in animation for decades. Nor does any other
studio have the marketing prowess to cross-promote family movies in
its theme parks, retail stores and cable and network television
outlets.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go to another studio, you may not have those capabilities
up and down the food chain," said Kim, of Kaufman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Pixar shareholders also may be cool to the idea of breaking up
such a financially successful partnership. Emeryville, Calif.-based
Pixar is expected to report strong third-quarter earnings Monday. The
studio's success is even outshining Jobs' main business endeavor,
Apple Computer Corp., which just posted a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of
$45 million due to soured investments and a decline in shipments of its
flagship Macintosh computers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Pixar's successful collaboration with Disney,
their marriage has been clouded by an underlying friction that's existed
for years between Eisner and Jobs, a factor that analysts suggest
could complicate future negotiations. Both men declined to be
interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   The specter of divorce first emerged last year with a fight
over the third installment of the lucrative "Toy Story" franchise. A
clause in the contract says sequels don't count toward films Pixar
must deliver, but Jobs has argued that Eisner should let "Toy Story
3" count as part of its five-picture deal. The dispute has left the
project in limbo.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions flared again this summer when Eisner offended Jobs over
remarks he made in Washington about digital piracy by suggesting
Apple was promoting the illicit practice with its slogan: "Rip. Mix.
Burn."</TE>
<TE>   'Never Been Better'</TE>
<TE>   The friction has since eased enough for Eisner to invite Jobs to
the World Series. The chairman of Disney Studios, Richard Cook,
insists the working relationship between the two companies "has never
been better."</TE>
<TE>   "We're committed to staying together," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, without any negotiations in sight, some analysts
believe that Disney could find itself at a disadvantage. The company,
they say, needs to step up to the plate to swat away potential
competitors. "You don't want to be in a position of countering
someone else's offer," said Katherine Styponias, an analyst with
Prudential Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Jobs bought Pixar in 1986 for $10 million from director George
Lucas and is its biggest stockholder, with a 60% stake. Disney has a
minority interest, holding less than 5%.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Jobs and Eisner formed their movie-making pact, one that
has changed significantly since then. On their first release, "Toy
Story," Pixar earned less than 15% of the profits. The 1995 hit
comedy heralded its director, John Lasseter, as the next Walt Disney
and established Pixar as the pioneer of the digital animation age.</TE>
<TE>   Five-Picture Pact</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, with its newly earned clout, Pixar negotiated its
lucrative five-picture deal in which it became equal partners with
Disney. The first film under the deal, "A Bug's Life," brought in
$362 million worldwide, and the second, "Monsters, Inc.," $530
million.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's profits could be greatly reduced if Jobs pursues a
deal he favors, which is similar to the one Lucas has with 20th Century
Fox. The filmmaker reaps all the profits from his lucrative "Star
Wars" franchise and pays Fox an 8% to 10% distribution fee to release
the movies.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens, both sides are heavily posturing, making it
known that success can be found outside their partnership.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner has sent mixed signals about whether he would be willing to
allow Disney to be relegated to a distributor's role. At a Sept. 13
meeting with investors and analysts in New York, the Disney chief
praised Pixar creative chief Lasseter and said that "a Lucas-type
deal" was possible. On other occasions, however, Eisner has insisted
that Disney would not be a distribution channel for rent.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner suggested Disney is prepared to develop its own sequels to
the "Toy Story" and "Monsters" hits if Pixar were to go its own way
-- a scenario that even Disney executives concede is improbable.
Eisner also has touted Disney's recently struck deal with John
Williams, one of the producers of "Shrek," to make computer-animated
movies, although no one is suggesting it's a replacement for Pixar.</TE>
<TE>   "The intended message was: 'If you think you've got us over a
barrel, think again,' " Styponias said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Jobs already has begun boasting to analysts that
Pixar has many options when it comes to landing a future deal with
another studio. Although he cannot begin negotiating with other
studios until next spring, when Pixar delivers the undersea adventure
"Finding Nemo" to Disney, he has let it be known that a number of
suitors have expressed interest. Those include Sony Corp.'s Sony
Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.'s MGM Studios, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Pixar Faces Risk Too</TE>
<TE>   As Jobs pushes for a Lucas-type distribution deal, analysts
caution that such an arrangement is not without risk for Pixar given
that its movies cost about $125 million each to produce and an
estimated $80 million to market worldwide. One flop could be
devastating to a company such as Pixar, which averages just one movie
every 18 months and is not diversified like Disney.</TE>
<TE>   "It's inevitable that Pixar is going to stub its toe," said
Merrill Lynch's Slabin.</TE>
<TE>   That may be hard for Jobs to fathom because Pixar's animated
movies so far have totaled more than $2 billion in worldwide
box-office receipts and hundreds of millions more in home video, DVD
and merchandising sales. Although the future of the Disney-Pixar
relationship remains uncertain, the turmoil has not affected the
day-to-day workings of the partnership. Indeed, Pixar creative guru
Lasseter, a former Disney animator, has helped foster close ties
between the studios' top creators.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the partners are focused on prepping "Finding Nemo," due
in theaters in May, and boosting sales of their recently released
"Monsters, Inc." DVD, which was heavily promoted during the World
Series games.</TE>
<TE>   In TV spots that aired between innings, Mike and Sully, the
animated stars of "Monsters," were featured playing baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The big question is whether their corporate parents are willing to
play ball as well.</TE>

<LD>The longshore union and shipping industry reached a tentative
agreement on technology -- the stickiest issue in their prolonged
labor dispute -- early Friday, after all-night talks with three
federal mediators and a top AFL-CIO official.</LD>
<LD>   No details were released on the deal, which many saw as a
breakthrough in the stalemate that has disrupted commercial trade
along the West Coast for more than a month.</LD>
<LD>   Wages and pension benefits still must be hammered out, according
to both the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which
represents 10,500 dockworkers, and the Pacific Maritime Assn., which
represents nearly 80 shipping lines and terminal operators.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge handed Microsoft Corp. an enormous victory, endorsing
nearly all of its antitrust settlement with the Justice Department
and rejecting harsher penalties sought by nine states.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly warned company founder
Bill Gates and other Microsoft executives, however, that she would
hold them individually responsible for complying with her
instructions.</LD>
<LD>   The nine dissenting states, joined by the District of Columbia,
had argued that tougher sanctions were needed to restore competition
in the computer industry. But the judge said penalties they sought
would chiefly benefit the company's rivals.</LD>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly made a few minor changes to the settlement that
require acceptance by Microsoft and the Justice Department, which
sued the software giant 4 1/2 years ago when Democrats held the White
House and economic times were rosier.</TE>

<LD>The European Union accused R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. in a
lawsuit of selling black-market cigarettes to drug traffickers and
mobsters, helping them to launder profits from their illegal
activities.</LD>
<LD>   The 149-page complaint filed in New York describes in detail
Reynolds' allegedly corrupt business dealings in Europe and Latin
America, including with members of the Italian Mafia and Russian
organized crime, Colombian drug cartels and government officials in
the Balkans.</LD>
<LD>   RJR executives "at the highest corporate level" made it "part of
their operating business plan to sell cigarettes to and through
criminal organizations and to accept criminal proceeds in payments
for cigarettes by secret and surreptitious means," the suit alleges.</LD>
<TE>   RJR called the lawsuit "absurd."</TE>

<LD>Citigroup Inc., which has been at the center of government probes
into alleged Wall Street misconduct, will create a unit to house its
stock research and retail brokerage operations and has hired a
well-respected executive to run the division.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise move is aimed at eliminating the potential conflicts
of interest that have sparked multiple government investigations of
Wall Street's practices in the late 1990s, Citigroup said.</LD>
<LD>   The unit, which will include more than 300 analysts and 12,500
brokers, will be headed by Sallie L. Krawcheck, a onetime stock
analyst who had been running Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., a highly
regarded independent research firm.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A flurry of weak economic reports left the door wide open for the
Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates this week, analysts
said.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board said consumer confidence fell to a nine-year
low in October, and auto makers reported sharply lower sales for the
month. The week ended with the government saying the unemployment
rate edged up to 5.7% in October from 5.6% in September.</LD>
<LD>   All told, the data suggested the economy had lost its momentum.
That will allow the Fed to justify reducing its key short-term rate
-- already at a 40-year low of 1.75% -- by at least a quarter point
when policymakers meet Wednesday, many experts predicted.</LD>

<LD>Federal authorities are investigating whether two doctors at a Tenet
Healthcare Corp. hospital in Northern California performed numerous
unneeded heart procedures on Medicare patients since late 1998.</LD>
<LD>   In an affidavit, FBI agent Michael Skeen said the two doctors who
practice at Redding Medical Center did unusually heavy volume of
heart catheterization and other coronary procedures, of which as many
as half may have been unnecessary, based on other doctor estimates.</LD>
<LD>   News of the investigation, which included a raid at the 238-bed
hospital, drove Santa Barbara-based Tenet's shares down 46% for the
week, to end Friday at $26.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>

<HD>U.S., States Sue to Block DirecTV Merger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EchoStar Communication Corp.'s yearlong bid to take over satellite
rival DirecTV appeared all but over last week as state and federal
antitrust officials -- unimpressed by some last-minute concessions --
sued to block the merger.</LD>
<LD>   The decision is likely to set off a series of intense legal
maneuvers by the two satellite-TV rivals over $600 million in breakup
fees tied to the failed merger.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department and attorneys general for California and 22
other states determined that a combination of the nation's two
satellite-TV providers would lead to higher prices, poorer service
and reduced incentive for innovation. Three weeks ago, the Federal
Communications Commission rejected the deal on similar grounds.</LD>
<TE>   Although EchoStar and DirecTV's parent, Hughes Electronics Corp.,
have the legal right to press their case in court, the unusual
one-two punch by the government makes it highly unlikely that the
companies can salvage the $18-billion deal, analysts say.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustrated with the high rates being charged by Southern California
Edison Co., the city of Corona plans to try to take over the
distribution of electricity within its boundaries by seizing control
of power lines from the big utility.</LD>
<LD>   A utility takeover would involve the city using its power of
eminent domain to condemn at least a portion of Edison's power lines
and substations. If that works -- it probably would carry an enormous
price tag -- Corona effectively would take control of power
distribution within its city limits.</LD>
<LD>   Edison vowed to go to court to block Corona's plans and said the
city can expect to rack up tens of millions of dollars in legal bills
if it pursues the takeover.</LD>

<LD>The stock market advanced for a fourth straight week, as investors
brushed aside disappointing economic data and focused on prospects
for lower interest rates.</LD>

viewing stocks as a better bet than Treasury bonds or short-term cash

<LD>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt found
himself embroiled in a new controversy, on reports that he failed to
share with fellow commissioners potentially inflammatory information
about the man Pitt picked to head the nation's new
accounting-oversight board.</LD>
<LD>   William H. Webster, whom the SEC approved by a 3-2 vote on Oct. 25
to lead the accounting board, had told Pitt before the vote that he
had been the audit-committee chairman of a small technology company
that has been sued by shareholders for fraud. Pitt did not inform the
other four commissioners.</LD>
<LD>   The revelations led to new calls for Pitt's resignation by
congressional Democrats, who say he has stumbled badly in his first
year as the nation's top securities cop.</LD>

<HD>Yes on Proposition 49: Prevent Juvenile Crime</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For too long, the needs of California's children have been ignored as
special interests have derailed repeated attempts to provide proven
after-school programs for California's children. Public safety
professionals witness the consequences of the lack of after-school
programs. Juvenile crime -- homicide, rape, robbery and assault --
surges between the hours of 3 and 6 p.m. This is when children are
most likely to abuse alcohol, tobacco or drugs or have sex. In most
instances, kids are also the victims of juvenile crime.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 49 is the solution to this serious problem. It would
provide consistent funding, without raising taxes, for after-school
programs at every elementary school and middle school in California.
Claremont McKenna College's Rose Institute analyzed Proposition 49
and determined that, for every dollar invested in after-school
programs, taxpayers would save $3 at the minimum.</LD>
<LD>   Consider spending a small amount of money for prevention versus
the costs of incarceration. The choice is obvious.</LD>

<HD>L.A. County Abandons Those Most Vulnerable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The L.A. County Board of Supervisors' decision to stop funding the
Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center is a short-term
solution that will do very little to resolve the anticipated budget
shortfall ("County OKs Hospital Cuts," Oct. 30). Instead, it will
leave thousands of paraplegic, quadriplegic and other ill and
disabled patients without the resources essential to their
rehabilitation. Sure, no one could have predicted a year ago that by
2006 the L.A. County Health Department would be approximately $700
million in the red.</LD>
<LD>   And I agree with the supervisors that difficult decisions must be
made -- but not at the expense of the most vulnerable members of our
society. Taking it out on spinal cord-injured patients is nothing
short of cruel and cowardly. I would have expected more sympathy and
compassion from the supervisors who voted for this. It sends the
wrong message about our priorities as residents of Los Angeles. The
whole objective of a rehabilitation center is to prepare individuals
to reenter society on their own, to be productive members of society.
Without the services of Rancho Los Amigos, some will be forced to
leave Southern California for other private hospitals, and hundreds
of others will have to resort to acute care or be left without care
at all. I urge the Board of Supervisors to reconsider its vote and
take a different course of action.</LD>

<HD>Inner-City Teacher Says No to Measure K</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Make no mistake about it, a "yes" vote on Measure K is a vote of
confidence for the L.A. Unified School District. As an inner-city
teacher, I am acutely aware of our need for more schools as well as
improving the ones we have. This, however, is secondary to our need
for an administration and school board that value education. They
need Measure K to pass so they can do business as usual, which puts
them first and the students and teachers a distant second. If the
hierarchy were reversed, there would not be such a desperate need for
Measure K.</LD>
<LD>   Those in the current hierarchy allow the money to come in at the
"top" and to be spent on their salaries, benefits, offices,
amenities, consultants, political back-scratching, etc. By the time
they take what they "need," it is no wonder that schools, students
and teachers must do without. If the hierarchy were reversed, we
already would have more and improved schools, and the LAUSD
executives might have to conduct their business in trailers or
dilapidated buildings like the ones in which we have to teach. Does
Measure K provide a solution for the real problems in our district
and in education? You decide on Nov. 5. This teacher is voting "no."</LD>

<HD>Film Agency Scandal Needs a Good Ending</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your Oct. 29 front-page article, "Film Agency's Chief Finds Himself
in D.A. Spotlight," about Los Angeles' Entertainment Industry
Development Corp., was a jaw-dropper. So the discredited head of the
agency, Cody Cluff, wined and dined Hollywood bigwigs as if he,
himself, were a film mogul! Until they caught up with him, Cluff had
his cake and ate it too. However, he is not the first and will not be
the last to let his proximity to show biz go to his head.</LD>
<LD>   The details of the agency's machinations and tossing of cash from
the money tree that keeps the EIDC afloat are not unbelievable when
you keep in mind that no one within the government of Los Angeles
kept an eye on it and how it was operating. If the story of Cluff and
the EIDC is not enough to make change happen in the oversight of all
public policy agencies, then nothing will do it. And all that will
come from the scandal is a change of heads, but no more.</LD>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis is inept, incompetent and sometimes just plain stupid
in the way he has run this state. I haven't seen one commercial on
television that would attempt to explain how he plans to get us out
of the mess that his managerially bankrupt leadership has gotten us
into. He has spent millions trashing his opponents. That probably
explains his answer to how he will proceed if reelected. He has no
idea.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Simon offers nothing to go by that would encourage me to vote
for him. What has he done that I can put my finger on and say, "That
is what we need"? Davis has spent a lot of money accusing Simon of
the very faults that he himself possesses. The pot calling the kettle
black. What do I do? I would rather eat a worm than vote for either
of them. That said, make mine well done, please.</LD>

<TE>   Although things don't look too rosy for Simon in the governor's
race, there is one thing in which he can take solace. No matter what
happens Tuesday, Simon will, without a doubt, get the honor of having
run the second-worst campaign in the history of elections -- ever!</TE>
<TE>   Now, there are many who may take exception to this and state that
Simon actually deserves the top spot. But the man who is currently
No. 1 is Flavius Moronicus, who, while running for the Senate during
the reign of Julius Caesar, stole a loaf of bread and then had
himself executed to prove he wasn't soft on crime. That, my friends,
was a bad campaign. Still, Simon should be very proud of his No. 2
ranking and know that it is truly, truly deserved.</TE>

They promised to mail one. Again, it never arrived. Tuesday I called
yet again, going through the same long wait on hold, to be told that
now I need to fax a request for an absentee ballot, which they again
promised to mail. I can only hope that the third time is the charm.
Something does not smell right. This isn't Florida ... or is it?</TE>

<LD>"To Some, Real Threat Is U.S." (Oct. 30) characterizes the debate
within the halls of the United Nations regarding Iraq as a conflict
between a stubborn, unilateralist U.S. and a reasonable and sensible
Security Council. Such a characterization is misleading and ignores
the many instances that the Security Council has failed to live up to
its responsibilities.</LD>
<LD>   Not only did it tolerate the material breaches by the Iraqis of
numerous Security Council resolutions passed in the wake of the Gulf
War, it ignominiously acquiesced in the departure of weapons
inspectors from Iraq in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   To think that the French proposal, with its provision for a second
round of discussions in the event of a failure of the new inspections
process, will promote the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction completely ignores all the evidence of the last 11 years.
There have been instances in the recent past where no one acted in
the face of a regional emergency (the genocide in Rwanda) and where a
U.S.-led coalition acted without the explicit backing of the U.N.
(ethnic cleansing in Kosovo). Those who insist on U.N. approval for
any use of force will have to answer for their complicity in the
deaths of innocents condemned by inaction.</LD>

<TE>   Bravo! Once again The Times has the courage to say it like it is.
Will the arrogance of the Bush administration never cease? If our
country supercedes international law, what hope is there for the
world? It opens the door to any country with weapons of mass
destruction (of which we are a prime example) to violate such laws
and act beyond all civilized behavior.</TE>
<TE>   What gives the U.S. the right to decide on a preemptive strike
against any other nation with only a suspicion, without full evidence
that there is a threat to the world or to us? This bullying attitude
on the part of the Bush administration can only inflame those who
already see the U.S. as the enemy -- rich, smug and immoral. Not in
my name will President Bush or even the go-along Congress take
military action against Iraq.</TE>

<TE>   Instead of spending our money on the financial costs of a war on
Iraq, we could spend that same amount on ensuring that the citizens
of Iraq have clothes to wear, food to eat, medicine for their
illnesses, education for their children and the like. In exchange,
Saddam Hussein could give up his nuclear and chemical weapons. We
would be known for our compassion.</TE>

<AU>Shlomo Avineri</AU>
<BD>Shlomo Avineri is a professor of political science at
the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and was director-general of
Israel's Foreign Ministry in the first administration of Yitzhak
Rabin.</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>When Palestinian suicide attacks on civilians in Israel are followed
by Israeli military actions against Palestinians, it is easy for the
rest of the world to shrug, dismissing the events as "a cycle of
violence" that defies reason. But such easy analysis ignores history.</LD>
<LD>   Last week's government crisis in Israel, which could lead to early
elections, may exacerbate some aspects of Israeli-Palestinian
relations. But it does not change the basic facts of the conflict.</LD>
<LD>   In order to understand the current crisis, one has to look back to
the Oslo agreements in 1993, signed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. Hope was in the air. Israel and the
PLO publicly recognized each other; Israel committed itself to
withdrawing from most of the West Bank and Gaza; the Palestinians
forswore violence. Most important, Arafat's return from Tunisia and
the establishment of an autonomous Palestinian Authority meant that
by the late 1990s more than 80% of the Palestinians would be living
under Palestinian rule. It appeared that a compromise was achievable.</LD>
<TE>   But then came the failure of the negotiations at Camp David in
June 2000 and later at Taba in the fall and early winter of 2000-01.
With the support of President Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak made the Palestinians a series of offers that most observers
thought Arafat could not refuse. But he did. Camp David and Taba
became the defining moments in recent Middle Eastern history -- just
as 9/11 later became a defining moment for U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's offers would have changed history. To recapitulate:</TE>
<TE>   * Barak accepted the establishment of a Palestinian state
alongside Israel. No previous Israeli leader -- including Nobel Peace
Prize laureates Rabin and Shimon Peres -- had agreed to such a
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   * Barak committed himself to an Israeli withdrawal from 93% to 97%
of the occupied territories in the West Bank and Gaza. This would
have entailed the uprooting of up to 30 Jewish settlements and the
displacement of some 30,000 Jewish settlers.</TE>
<TE>   * In exchange for those Jewish settlements that would remain in
the territories, Barak offered equivalent land within Israel proper
-- an idea never before considered.</TE>
<TE>   * Contrary to the avowed Israeli position that Jerusalem would
remain forever the undivided capital of Israel, Barak agreed to
redivide Jerusalem, so that the Arab part could become the capital of
a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   * Again without precedent, Barak offered power-sharing with the
Palestinians on the Temple Mount.</TE>
<TE>   * Finally, Barak was ready to consider, on humanitarian grounds,
the return of a limited number of Palestinian refugees displaced by
Israel's 1948 War of Independence.</TE>
<TE>   These were offers made at considerable political cost to Barak.
Two of his coalition partners left his government in protest; in the
end, Barak lost his parliamentary majority and had to call early
elections. In February 2001, soon after the collapse of Taba, he was
defeated by Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian response to Barak's offers was not simply to
refuse them but rather to make further demands that Israel simply
could not meet. Arafat insisted that Israel agree to the right of
return for Palestinian refugees of the 1948 war -- and for all their
descendants. Accepting this concept would spell the end of Israel as
a Jewish state -- and Arafat's insistence on it signified to most
Israelis that the Palestinian leadership has not yet reconciled
itself to the existence of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In the Israeli mind, it appeared that the Palestinians were not
focused on addressing the consequences of the 1967 Israeli occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza: Their aim was rather to undo the events of
1948 -- to undo the establishment of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's rejection of the Taba offers was accompanied by a
reversion to terrorism and suicide bombing. There is no doubt that
Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount during the fall of 2000 was an
unnecessary provocation, and even Israelis would have understood a
few days of rage and protest among Palestinians. But the wholesale
reversion to terrorism that followed was not triggered by Sharon's
visit. It now appears to most Israelis that the violence is part of a
strategy by Arafat to wrest from Israel through terrorism what he
could not achieve with negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   It is not that Arafat initiates or directly orders all suicide
attacks. The situation is more complex -- and in a way, more ominous.
But any doubts about the Palestinian Authority's tacit approval of
the violence are dispelled by its actions: When the physical remains
of a suicide bomber are turned over to the Palestinians, the bomber
is given a state funeral by the Palestinian Authority, with an
official armed guard of honor. He or she is declared a martyr whose
family receives a special pension. The day after the funeral,
Palestinian schools receive a fax from the Palestinian Ministry of
Education, with a CV and photo of the suicide bomber. Schools are
urged to teach the "martyr's" life history as a role model for
Palestinian children.</TE>
<TE>   This is the reality Israelis have been facing in the last two
years. It has left them, even those who are unhappy with some of the
more brutal aspects of Israel's response, hard-pressed to offer an
alternative. Barak made the Palestinians a generous offer --
independence, sovereignty, even a part of Jerusalem. Most Israelis --
about 70% according to polls -- have concluded from the Palestinians'
rejection of this offer that their aim is not a workable compromise.
They want to see Israel eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   So what is to be done? To revive a failed peace process is even
more difficult than starting a completely new one; Humpty-Dumpty
cannot simply be put back together again. Urging both sides to return
to the negotiating table sounds reasonable, but it's almost certainly
an exercise in futility. Hatred and mistrust on both sides are deeper
than ever. There is no effective opposition to Arafat except from the
even more extremist Islamic Hamas, because his anti-Israel views
reflect those of most Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The only reasonable path at the moment is a "nonsolution" like
those in Bosnia, Kosovo and Cyprus. In none of these conflicts has a
solution been found. Nobody knows how Bosnia will look in five years;
nobody has an idea whether Kosovo will eventually become an
independent state, a part of Albania or remain a province of a
reformed and democratic Yugoslavia. But despite the fact that none of
those conflicts has been resolved, there is stability. The daily
clashes and bloodshed have stopped. Something akin to this type of
stabilization is the most that can be expected for the foreseeable
future between Israelis and Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Israel should move unilaterally now to disengage from the
territories. It must dismantle a significant number of settlements
and create an effective and enforceable boundary between it and the
territories as a barricade to suicide bombers. Only after a period of
stabilization and cooling tempers would a return to the negotiating
table be possible.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians at Camp David and Taba made a terrible mistake --
similar to the one made by the Chechens in 1999 when they decided not
to abide by the de facto independence granted to them by the
Russian-Chechen treaty of 1996. Camp David and Taba were diplomatic
moments of grace -- and the Palestinians rejected them. We have now
to opt for second best, for a series of stopgap measures.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides need time off, in much the same way Serbs and Albanians
needed time off. We tend to see only two options: a fully negotiated
peace or all-out war. But we must now look to a third way. The
international community has learned to live with such ambiguities
elsewhere; it must accept them in the Middle East too. Another
utopian attempt at "solution" may be as counterproductive as the
well-intentioned attempts at Camp David and Taba turned out to be.</TE>

<AU>Peter Bouckaert</AU>
<BD>Peter Bouckaert is a senior researcher for Human Rights
Watch.</BD>
<DL>ARBIL, Iraq</DL>
<LD>During a dinner in Iraqi Kurdistan last month, the elderly matron of
the family I was dining with urged my interpreter to translate her
question. The interpreter was reluctant, but finally did. Was it true
what people were saying? That the U.S. would release a gas in Baghdad
to put the populace to sleep, then snatch President Saddam Hussein
and his henchmen without the need for bombs?</LD>
<LD>   "If only it could be so easy," I replied, laughing. Her face fell.
She had clearly been clinging to the hope that a bloodless coup was
possible, one in which her many relatives in Baghdad would escape
unscathed.</LD>
<LD>   It's not just Iraqis who don't want to face the very real
likelihood of widespread civilian casualties resulting from U.S.
military action. Debate in America has focused on polarizing
questions about the propriety of preemption, the wisdom of forcing
regime change and the strength of the evidence concerning Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction. But whether one favors or opposes war
(my organization, Human Rights Watch, is neutral on that issue), it
is equally important to consider the grave dangers the Iraqi people
could face once war starts, and to develop workable strategies to
minimize those dangers.</LD>
<TE>   The risk of civilian casualties from the fighting itself is likely
to be particularly high in Iraq. Hussein will almost certainly
attempt to draw the U.S. into an urban battle, one in which Iraqi
civilians are used as human shields. Anyone who remembers the intense
fighting in Jenin several months ago, or the bloody 1993 battle of
Mogadishu, Somalia, depicted in the movie "Black Hawk Down," realizes
what dangers urban warfare represents. In addition, despite
significant technological improvements during the last decade, the
Pentagon continues to make deadly mistakes from the air, often by
relying on inaccurate intelligence. Finally, U.S. willingness to
target and destroy civilian infrastructure such as water treatment
facilities is likely to cause many casualties; during the first Gulf
War, more civilians died as a result of this practice than were
killed directly by the bombs.</TE>
<TE>   In Iraq, civilian casualties caused by U.S. military actions would
probably be only a part of the picture. The greatest threat to the
Iraqi people could well come from the Iraqi army. The direct civilian
death toll of allied military action during the Gulf War, Kosovo and
Afghanistan combined is dwarfed by the estimated 30,000 who died
during Hussein's repression of the 1991 uprisings, or by the
estimated 100,000 Kurds killed in his genocidal Al Anfal campaign in
the late 1980s. Hussein is the only known head of state who has used
chemical weapons against his own people -- as he also did against
Iranian troops -- and he is likely to do so again in any battle for
his life.</TE>
<TE>   In Kurdistan last month, the risks to civilians were very clear.
My driver took me out to the last house in the dusty Iraqi Kurdish
village of Kalak, the last outpost before the border with the rest of
Iraq. From the roof of the house, I looked out at Iraqi army troops
that have taken up positions on a line of hills a few hundred meters
away. Iraq's Kurds, armed with little more than machine guns, stand
no chance against the well-equipped Iraqi troops on the hills. The
troops are restrained from attacking by the threat of U.S.
retaliation. This curb would be removed if the U.S. decided to attack
Iraq. It is people like the virtually defenseless villagers of Kalak
who would face the wrath of a cornered Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   If the United States initiates a war with Iraq, it will have an
obligation to do what it can to protect vulnerable Shiite and Kurdish
populations from attack. In Kosovo, NATO bombers could do little from
the air to protect civilians as the Serbian forces intensified their
killing in response to the bombing. The United States cannot allow a
repeat of that tragic experience.</TE>
<TE>   The safety of Iraqi civilians will be greatly complicated by the
fact that there is only a limited humanitarian presence in the
country, and that the agencies present are subject to the whims of
Baghdad. In Iraqi Kurdistan, I saw almost no preparation for a
humanitarian crisis or chemical weapon attacks -- partly because
Baghdad controls the flow of humanitarian aid to the north.</TE>
<TE>   Fleeing civilians may also face closed borders, blocking access to
safety. In 1991, tens of thousands of people trying to escape were
stuck on the wrong side of the closed Turkish border; some froze to
death. Any planning for military action requires the development of a
well-funded humanitarian option, and pressure on regional governments
to commit to keeping their borders open.</TE>
<TE>   War in Iraq could also cause furious interethnic fighting and
massive retribution against perceived supporters of Hussein. During
my three weeks in Iraqi Kurdistan, I met with dozens of Kurdish and
Turkoman families recently expelled by the Iraqi government from the
oil-rich city of Kirkuk and now living in miserable conditions in
Kurdistan. The Kurds can be expected to return en masse to Kirkuk at
the first opportunity -- and they could well decide to retaliate
against the Arabs whom Hussein brought in to replace them. There is
also likely to be a fierce, and perhaps violent, competition among
Arabs, Kurds and possibly Turkish troops over control of the city.</TE>
<TE>   It is likely that members of Hussein's Baath Party, his Tikrit
clan and his hated security services will face severe retaliation in
the immediate aftermath of his fall. To prevent blood baths, the U.S.
needs to make absolutely clear to its potential allies among
Hussein's opposition that abuses by them will be punished. Such a
commitment was not forthcoming in Afghanistan, where the Northern
Alliance troops in Mazar-i-Sharif killed hundreds of captured
combatants without much worry about being brought to justice.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, experience teaches us that the fall of a government
creates a security gap. In Afghanistan, U.S. failure to immediately
fill that gap allowed the warlords to force their way into positions
of control and allowed mass looting and similar abuses. In Kosovo,
the victorious Kosovo Liberation Army immediately began killing
Serbian and Gypsy civilians whom they suspected of collaboration with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Bringing stability, security
and accountable governance to Iraq is a major, long-term commitment,
but one that the United States must shoulder when it embarks on such
an intervention.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration appears to be planning for a more
ambitious role in Iraq than in Afghanistan -- including the
possibility of a long-term military occupation of the country. In
that planning, the security of the civilian population, particularly
in the chaotic early days after Hussein's fall, must be a paramount
U.S. objective.</TE>

<LD>"The city came into being to preserve life, it exists for the good
life."</LD>
<LD>   -- from the west cornice of the Mayor Tom Bradley Room, City Hall</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   The mayors are not smiling. From the walls of their official
portrait gallery, a remote and unheralded aerie on the 26th floor of
City Hall, they stare somberly ahead, as if wondering what went
wrong. Los Angeles, the city that came together under their guidance,
one annexed piece of land at a time, stands in danger of unraveling.
And there is nothing they can do about it.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is there anything we can do. The lines have been drawn, the
arguments made. For better or worse, we live in the world these men
created, and our decision on Tuesday -- whether to let the Valley or
Hollywood secede -- passes judgment on their work. Hoary visages,
they look out from their gilded frames through windows that face
their messy triumphs, and they must wonder why we have become so
faithless, distrustful and disenfranchised.</TE>
<TE>   Canadians, Irishmen, Missourians, Illinoisans, the early mayors
were strangers to this place. They shared a goal of making a life and
building a city far from home. Merchants, bankers, privileged
landowners, they believed that what they desired would be beneficial
for those whose lives were lived less publicly. We can see them now,
these stern patriarchs, through the gauze of time, in their outdated
clothes and hairstyles, seated for a moment in triumph.</TE>
<TE>   Can we stare them down? Benjamin D. Wilson, our second mayor, from
1851 to 1852, presided over 160 acres -- from Figueroa Street to the
river, from Pico Boulevard to San Fernando Road. Can we look him in
the eyes and tell him that it doesn't work anymore? Can we make the
case for secession to John G. Nichols, the mayor in 1852 and 1853 and
again from 1856 to 1859? He sat for his portrait with the pride of
being the first mayor to expand the city, having presented to the
United States Land Commission the city's claim to four square leagues
of land.</TE>
<TE>   Annexation and consolidation were the watchwords for the
politicians and speculators who followed and realized that Nichols'
plot of 28 square miles was insignificant when set against the vast
ranchos and the open spaces that surrounded it. So they learned to
wield water like a carrot and a stick, channeling it or withholding
it, promising it or diverting it in bids to acquire outlying areas
and municipalities.</TE>
<TE>   It was a random process that led at first to the acquisition of
Highland Park, Garvanza, Sycamore Grove and an area south of Slauson
and west of Arlington. Then the city needed a harbor. Enter Frank
Rader, an innocent-looking man with a handlebar mustache and wavy
hair. During his term -- 1894 to 1896 -- federal funding was secured
to develop a port in San Pedro. It proved to be the first step in a
nearly 10-year battle that joined Republicans and Democrats in the
common goal to annex not only San Pedro but also Wilmington and a
16-mile-long, half-mile-wide strip running from downtown to the
harbor itself.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't just the mayors' ambition, but commerce and cupidity
that fueled the city's growth. Look to the next major annexation -- a
168-square-mile parcel just over the Cahuenga Pass from Hollywood --
for proof of that. The San Fernando Valley was a dream waiting to be
sold. It began in 1909 with the founding of the Los Angeles Suburban
Homes Co., the Los Angeles-based syndicate that purchased and
subdivided the land. It continued with land auctions that doubled the
initial investments, and it ended with William Mulholland standing on
the bunting-draped platform in 1913 welcoming the arrival of the
Owens River water.</TE>
<TE>   "There it is. Take it," he said, and standing near him on that
auspicious November day was Henry R. Rose, the newly elected mayor.
It had to have been an awkward moment. Rose -- his portrait reveals a
shrewd, battle-sharpened face -- campaigned against speculators like
those who rooted for Mulholland, so eager to turn a dollar on this
newly arable land.</TE>
<TE>   It would be naive to think that economics was the only motive for
building the city. People believed in it. When the Valley annexation
election was held in 1915, Valley residents overwhelmingly favored
joining Los Angeles: 681, or 96%, voted yes; 25 were opposed. It had
taken nearly eight administrations in City Hall to accomplish this,
some 17 years that saw one mayor die in office and one resign, saw a
Socialist leader nearly get elected and a newspaper get bombed.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all the arrogance this city has fostered, there has been a
strange nobility about its adventurism as well. Los Angeles was a
city not about to be limited by either geography or politics. In two
days we will see whether this conceit has run its course and whether
the city that these men imagined, running from the mountains to the
sea, from the Valley to the harbor, is as relevant for tomorrow as it
was for yesterday.</TE>
<TE>   It is a measure of our myopia that this panorama -- across time
and place -- has been missing from any discourse about secession. It
is a panorama that these mayors, hanging in this forgotten gallery,
still take in. From these windows, the idea of Los Angeles -- a
modern city perched on the western shores of a continent -- seems
more persuasive than the reality of a city of 3.7 million people.</TE>
<TE>   From here, Los Angeles is more than the sum of its parts. This
hybrid, this mongrel, this gerrymandered metropolis, is greater than
whatever local self-interest has not been addressed. High above the
potholes, the SigAlerts and crime scenes, you get a sense of the
ambition -- in the arrangement of the buildings, the grid of the
streets, the municipal facades and transportation corridors -- that
has driven this city. From here, it's hard not to see secession as a
step backward, as something that turns us from ourselves, from our
ability to think large and courageously in spite of our
imperfections.</TE>
<TE>   From here, you can follow the streets into the haze and imagine
the life the city has made possible. You get a sense of a place that
dreamed itself into being, and it leaves you wondering how we could
even consider taking apart what others once worked so hard to bring
together.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, Nichols, Rader and Rose -- who were these men? Many have
become mere footnotes to the grander life of this city, their
accomplishments largely forgotten and their contributions invisible.
While we may not know what they did, we must acknowledge their
collective efforts to make this city matter. Ignore that and we bury
them, as well as our past. Which may be too romantic, too nostalgic a
notion to stave off secession. What was created through the will and
exertion of a few has settled more broadly in the hands of the many.</TE>
<TE>   One day, James Kenneth Hahn's portrait will hang on these walls.
He will look no different to us than his campaign photo, no different
to future generations than the other mayors in their anonymous glory,
but embedded in his gaze, lying beyond the skill of the painter, will
be the image of a city that lay on the brink of being irreparably
lost.</TE>

<HD>What About Reform, Chief?</HD>

<AU>Joe Domanick</AU>
<BD>Joe Domanick is the senior fellow at USC's Annenberg
School Institute for Justice and Journalism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For months now, Police Commission President Rick Caruso has been
saying that rising crime and sagging officer morale are the most
critical issues facing the Los Angeles Police Department. He has
apparently forgotten the overriding reason why William J. Bratton was
hired as the new chief: to fundamentally reform the department.
Better crime-fighting techniques and happier police officers, though
commendable objectives, fall well short of the larger goal.</LD>
<LD>   So far, Bratton's emphasis has been misplaced as well. He has had
far more to say about graffiti than reform at a time when many people
wonder how he intends to deal with the cowboy-cop culture that has
mired the LAPD in crisis after crisis since four officers severely
beat up Rodney King more than 11 years ago. Yes, Bratton has been
chief for only about a week, and the kind of fundamental departmental
reform that's needed requires careful planning and implementation.
But it would be reassuring to hear him talk more about his strategy,
even if only in broad strokes, for attacking the root cultural causes
of LAPD problems.</LD>
<LD>   This isn't to downplay the disturbing fact that crime,
particularly the number of murders, is rising in Los Angeles. After
dramatic drops in the late 1990s, homicides have jumped in 2002 by
almost 15%, or 27% since 2000. Police say gang killings account for
about 75% of these murders.</LD>
<TE>   Bratton says that increasing arrests by 16% to 20% will slow down
the killing. But in Los Angeles, with its deeply rooted,
intergenerational gang culture, you can't simply arrest your way out
of gang violence. Truth be told, arrest rates are more a reflection
of crime rates than a deterrent to criminality. During
high-crime-rate years in the 1980s and early 1990s, the large number
of gang arrests made by the LAPD did not deter murderers in the city.
Conversely, when homicides and gang killings in L.A. dramatically
dipped in the latter half of the 1990s, as they did in other big
cities, arrests came down too. A booming economy that enabled large
numbers of people to move out of poverty, fewer people in the
crime-prone age groups, the end of the crack wars, longer prison
sentences, gang truces and smarter policing had more to do with
falling crime rates than numbers of arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Bratton's focus on arrest rates overlooks a more
important truth about the LAPD, one that he must accept if he is
serious about changing the department's image. When commissioner of
the New York Police Department, his philosophy was to arrest more
people for minor crimes -- "quality of life" arrests, as he calls
them -- in order to stop more serious ones, and it seemed to work.
NYPD cops whom New York residents regarded as ineffective on the job
were suddenly on the streets making arrests.</TE>
<TE>   But enforcing the letter of the law has never, until recently,
been a problem in L.A. In fact, for decades, the LAPD has made
quality-of-life stops and arrests -- often accompanied by prone-outs,
harassment and policy through intimidation. These tactics, more than
anything else, have alienated and enraged the city's impoverished
minority residents.</TE>
<TE>   Arrests have fallen in L.A. because of officer attrition caused by
the face-off between former Chief Bernard C. Parks and the Police
Protective League over Parks' arbitrary disciplinary system. Fewer
cops on the street mean fewer arrests. And many cops who remain on
the force have backed off from aggressive enforcement out of a fear
of being disciplined for trivial rule infractions. For Bratton to
tell his officers, as he did at his swearing-in, that he didn't want
them driving by "smiling and waving" but "out on the streets and in
the parks," presumably making arrests, may thus send the wrong
message: that it's OK to return to the policing style that has gotten
the department into so much trouble.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't to deny that gangs, gang violence and graffiti aren't
intertwined. Territorial tagging leads to turf wars, and graffiti is
a blight that saps the aspirations and deflates the pride of entire
neighborhoods. To the extent that it can be stopped, it should be.
But enforcing graffiti laws is treating a symptom. Arresting ever
more taggers won't alleviate the underlying problems that lead to
gang killings and violence.</TE>
<TE>   Once Bratton settles into office, he will, it is hoped, formulate
a strategy to deal with gang violence, build on the smart
gang-prevention programs that the LAPD has initiated or been involved
in, and work with community activists, former gang members,
civic-minded business and union leaders and other government agencies
to promote gang truces and devise solutions. In the meantime, a
little smiling and waving, rather than the legendary Robocop
sternness of LAPD cops, is a good, not a bad, thing. It is what
hiring a new reform chief was all about.</TE>

Bratton's focus on "quality of life" crimes, a strategy that brought
him success in New York City, might not transfer well to Los Angeles,
where police are often seen in minority communities as harassing
residents over small or nonexistent matters.</CP>

<LD>Everyone who has picked up his or her clothes at a dry cleaner has
experienced it. You detect a slight -- sometimes stronger -- chemical
odor when you take the clothes out of the plastic wrapping. You might
have even wondered whether the smell signals danger.</LD>
<LD>   It does. The chemical you smell -- perchloroethylene, or PCE -- is
bad for the environment, a health hazard for employees at
dry-cleaning facilities and a problem for communities where dry
cleaners are located. Yet, a government agency's innovative approach
to PCE may eventually eliminate that odor.</LD>
<LD>   PCE is the favorite cleaning solvent of the vast majority of dry
cleaners in Southern California for some delicate garments. At first,
cleaners relied on a petroleum solvent to do the job, but it posed a
fire risk. In a search for a less combustible solvent, a number of
chlorine-based chemicals were introduced, among them PCE, whose lower
costs and better cleaning qualities made it the cleaner of choice.</LD>
<TE>   Because dry-cleaning businesses are typically small neighborhood
operations, emissions from a single dry-cleaning plant are slight
when compared with, say, an oil refinery. But exposures from
thousands of neighborhood dry cleaners have produced major health and
environmental problems. As early as the 1970s, research pointed to
PCE's potential harm to human health and the environment as a toxic
air contaminant, an occupational hazard and a probable human
carcinogen.</TE>
<TE>   Given such risks, government agencies sought to minimize PCE
exposure by requiring dry cleaners to install expensive control
technologies and devices. But the problem persisted and became more
and more of an issue as the nature and extent of PCE hazards were
better understood. Environmentalists and community members were
unhappy because they believed serious risks remained unmitigated. Dry
cleaners were unhappy because of numerous government rules and
regulations, horrendous liability problems and control technologies
that increased costs and reduced the effective life of their
machines. Some consumer groups, notably Consumers Union, worried
about that chemical smell on clothes.</TE>
<TE>   As regulation of PCE dry cleaning intensified in the 1990s, so did
interest in the development of alternatives to PCE. Significantly,
this search paralleled a shift in approach to pollution control, from
managing the problem after its creation to preventing it in the first
place. The dry-cleaning industry highlights the limits of the more
reactive approach: Compliance with regulations is hard to monitor and
enforce, and end-of-pipe controls such as vapor-recovery technology
are expensive, costly to maintain and ultimately ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   A new technology recently introduced, professional wet cleaning,
illustrates the preventive approach. It uses computer-controlled
washers and dryers, formulated nontoxic detergents and specialized
finishing equipment to clean delicate garments in water. Because it
removes PCE from the cleaning process, professional wet cleaning
eliminates all the risks and regulations associated with its use.</TE>
<TE>   Our research, including a new report titled "Commercialization of
Professional Wet Cleaning," indicates that this more environmentally
friendly system is viable. It cleans clothes as well as a PCE-based
process. It is more profitable. Some costs, including the upfront
costs of the machines, are cheaper.</TE>
<TE>   Cleaners who have made the switch express strong satisfaction with
wet cleaning. Take Moon Noh, a Korean immigrant who had been dry
cleaning for 27 years at a small shop in San Clemente. He started wet
cleaning about 15 months ago, when he needed to replace his old
PCE-based dry-cleaning equipment and wanted to avoid the hassle of
the PCE-regulatory regime. Noh also suffered from dizziness,
headaches, fatigue, runny nose and heightened allergic reactions that
he associated with exposure to PCE. As a professional wet cleaner,
Noh's costs are lower, his customers are pleased with the results and
he no longer has headaches or suffers from any of the other possible
health effects of PCE exposure.</TE>
<TE>   The viability of professional wet cleaning prompted the staff of
South Coast Air Quality Management District to take the unprecedented
step of proposing a rule calling for a 15-year phaseout of PCE
starting in July 2004. Because dry-cleaning equipment generally lasts
about 10 years, the proposal will not require dry cleaners to replace
their PCE-dependent machines until the end of their useful life.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the AQMD board heard public testimony, and it will vote
next month on the phaseout rule. If the board adopts the staff
proposal, it would be an example of government rule-making solving a
problem by preventing it instead of perpetuating it. For businesses,
workers, the community and the environment, it would be a winning
proposition.</TE>

<DH>After two years of ongoing violence, the reservoirs of hate
are full</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Grossman</AU>
<BD>Israeli novelist David Grossman is the author, most
recently, of "Be My Knife."</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>I might begin this piece, now that the second anniversary of the
second intifada has come and gone, with the day that Ariel Sharon
made his entry into the Temple Mount and set off a conflagration in
the occupied territories. But the story could actually begin in any
of the seven years that preceded September 2000. During that period,
Israel and the Palestinians did everything in their power to disrupt
and confound the fragile agreement they cobbled together at Oslo.
Israel doubled the number of its settlers in the territories, and the
Palestinians smuggled in weapons, hoarded ammunition and prepared for
war.</LD>
<LD>   Those who were attentive then to the Palestinians' complaints and
warnings about the Oslo agreement and the reality it was supposed to
make permanent could have seen something was amiss. It offered the
Palestinians a tiny state, sliced into segments by a massive Israeli
presence. More than anything else, this reality served Israel's
stringent security needs. The prescient could have understood then
what would happen.</LD>
<LD>   Few in Israel were capable of listening to the warnings. The
Palestinians joined in the march of folly by responding to Sharon's
provocation with an outbreak of unrestrained violence.</LD>
<TE>   Now two years have gone by. Two years of unlived life for both
peoples. Two years of living with our senses, our reason for living,
our habits, our hopes, dulled and constricted.</TE>
<TE>   More than 600 Israelis have been killed in more than 14,000
attacks in the last two years. Nearly 1,400 Palestinians have been
killed by Israeli military forces. Yet each side is certain that the
other side has not suffered enough.</TE>
<TE>   That being the case, it's clear that the conflict has yet to
exhaust the reservoirs of hatred and has yet to bring both peoples to
the state of exhaustion that will be necessary for them to begin
making concessions. Indeed, almost the opposite is true -- the
Palestinians' bloody terror attacks have led to a metamorphosis.
Israel's decades of repression in the territories that it occupied in
1967 (an occupation that was instigated, let's not forget, by the
hostile acts of Arab countries against Israel) have nearly been
expunged from Israeli consciousness. It's very easy for most Israelis
to believe that blame for the current situation rests entirely with
the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   That may well be the root cause of the prevailing despair over
whether any mutual understanding can be achieved. The Palestinians
begin their timeline for the conflict in, at the latest, 1948, when
the state of Israel was founded. Israelis, for the most part, place
the starting point of their timeline at September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   According to this Israeli perception, there is no chance of
compromise now, because "there's no partner," because "the
Palestinians are all terrorists" and because "they rejected the
generous offer that Ehud Barak made them." The Palestinians also
despair in advance of any compromise. In their perception, any
agreement that could be achieved in the current international climate
would favor Israel and would not meet even the minimal requirements
of the Palestinian people.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, the Palestinians' strategic choice to use terror as
their weapon worked like a boomerang. It severely weakened the moral
force of the Palestinian struggle and branded Yasser Arafat as a
terrorist in the United States and elsewhere in the West. It also
provided a not-insignificant justification for Israel's harsh and
massive military response.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Israel is worse off than at any time in the last 35
years. Its security, economy and national mood are in decline. Yet
Sharon, its failure of a prime minister, remains an overwhelmingly
popular man in the country, even after the collapse last week of his
coalition government. There's a simple explanation. He has succeeded
-- with no little help from Palestinian terrorism -- in getting the
Israeli people to restrict their view of their complex conflict with
the Palestinians to a single question. Israelis now think solely
about their personal security. It's certainly an issue of decisive
importance, especially in the current state of affairs. Yet Sharon's
political cunning is such that he has succeeded in reducing it to a
single dimension, so that the only answer to the great and
complicated question, "How does Israel make itself secure?" is: "By
force."</TE>
<TE>   That is the field of Sharon's expertise. Force, more force and
only force. The result is that any time some small spark of a chance
appears, every time there is a decline in violence, Sharon rushes to
carry out another "targeted liquidation" of another Palestinian
commander, and the fire flares again. Any time that Palestinian
representatives declare their willingness to renew negotiations and
halt violence, the response from Sharon's office is dismissal and
derision.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has loyal allies -- the extremists among the Palestinians,
who are also quick to incite the street and send more and more
suicide bombers to Israel's cities each time there seems to be a
respite. Each side is thus playing on the fears and despair of the
other, each chasing the other around the familiar vicious circle: The
more violence increases, the less chance there is of persuading
people on either side that there is any chance of an accommodation,
and that makes the violence spiral up to an even higher level.</TE>
<TE>   So two years have passed. Who has won and who has lost?</TE>
<TE>   On the surface -- and this is true only for this moment -- Israel
has undoubtedly won. Arafat is losing his international legitimacy.
Until the latest Israeli move on his Ramallah compound, he was losing
his hold over his own people as well, as they became more and more
aware of his corruption and his failure as a leader. The senior
command level of most of the Palestinian organizations has been
liquidated or trapped by Israeli security forces. The people on the
second and third levels are inexperienced in combat, in
organizational skills and in field security. The result is that
Israel has been hugely successful in preventing most of the terrorist
attacks that the Palestinians have tried to commit.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Israel is paying a high price. Two years into the intifada,
Israel is more militant, nationalist and racist than it has ever been
before. The very broad national consensus, notwithstanding the Labor
party's recent defection from the Sharon coalition, has placed all
criticism and minority opinions outside the bounds of legitimacy.
Anyone who opposes the brutality of the Sharon government's actions
is suspected of disloyalty bordering on treason. Sanctimonious
self-righteousness, disdain for the "gutless" values of democracy and
calls for the expulsion of Israel's Arab citizens (in addition to the
Palestinians in the territories) have became an accepted and
legitimate part of the public discourse.</TE>
<TE>   The power of the extremist religious parties is increasing. A wave
of crude and sentimental "patriotism" is sweeping through the
country. It wells up out of the authentic, historic and almost primal
sensibilities of "Jewish destiny" in its most tragic form.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis, the citizens of the strongest military power in the
region, are once more, with strange enthusiasm, walling themselves up
behind their sense of being persecuted, vulnerable victims. The
Palestinian threat -- ridiculous in terms of the balance of power,
but effective in its results -- has returned Israel, with depressing
speed, to the experience of living in fear of utter destruction.
That, of course, justifies a brutal response to the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has won for the moment, but what does a victory mean when
it brings no hope for a better future, not even a sense of security
and relief? The Palestinians have lost for the moment, but they are
now fighting with their backs to the wall, and it is hard to believe
that they will surrender and accept Sharon's diktats.</TE>
<TE>   It may turn out that, as with the first intifada, the Palestinians
have no stamina for interminable struggle and that, as they did then,
they face a period of social disintegration and bitter internal
struggles. It would behoove Israel not to rejoice if that happens,
because in the end Israel has, or at least should have, an interest
in a strong and resilient Palestinian society guided by a leadership
with a broad base of support. Only such a Palestinian society can
sign a stable peace agreement with Israel that will include historic
concessions. But this kind of complexity cannot today penetrate the
dullness of the Israeli spirit and mind. And since the Israelis are
stronger than the Palestinians, the conflict appears doomed to go on
as it is for an unpredictable period of time.</TE>
<TE>   Two years have gone by, and there is no hope. The situation can be
summed up in a number of ways. I will do so by citing two facts that
jumped out at me from recent reports. The first: According to data
provided by U.N. agencies, nearly a quarter of Palestinian children
now suffer chronic malnutrition as a result of the military
situation. The second: Israeli schoolchildren will soon be receiving
lessons in early identification of suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis and Palestinians who refuse to see the connection between
these two facts ensure that for many years to come we will all be
each other's hostages, agents of gratuitous and pointless death.</TE>

<HD>A State of Change: California's Tilt Toward the Left</HD>

<LD>On Tuesday, California voters will go to the polls and most likely
entrust their state entirely to Democrats. Despite the fact that the
Democratic ticket is headed by an incumbent governor about as popular
as a strain of bacteria, every Democratic candidate for statewide
office is leading in the polls. The party's huge majorities in the
state's legislative and congressional delegations will remain intact
not just in this election but for the foreseeable future.</LD>
<LD>   For a state that was the spawning ground of modern American
conservatism -- home to Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Howard
Jarvis -- this total make-over into the nation's foremost Democratic
bastion has been stunning. But this partisan realignment is just one
aspect of the transformation of America's mega-state. In fact,
California has become by many measures the most liberal state in the
land. Here are just some of the laws enacted by the Legislature and
signed by Gov. Gray Davis in the course of the year:</LD>
<LD>   * The nation's first paid family leave program, guaranteeing
workers up to six weeks off for medical and other emergencies. Such
programs have long been a staple in social democratic Europe but
entirely absent from the United States.</LD>
<TE>   * Long-overdue legislation granting binding mediation to farm
workers, who over the last quarter-century had been able to win first
contracts at just one-third of the farms where workers had voted to
establish a union.</TE>
<TE>   * Much stricter auto emissions standards than those mandated by
the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   * A statute requiring utilities to produce one-fifth of their
energy from renewable sources by 2017.</TE>
<TE>   * The promotion and funding of stem-cell research in California's
universities and laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   * Legislation making gun manufacturers liable in civil court for
gun violence.</TE>
<TE>   With statutes such as these, 35 million Californians, representing
one-eighth of the nation's population, now live in a state that is
diverging dramatically from the policies of the national government.
Labor and environmental interests that are stymied in Washington are
heeded in Sacramento. The religious right and the gun lobby, which
loom so large in national politics, cast a very small shadow here.
Davis may veto many of the bills that an increasingly liberal
Legislature plunks onto his desk, but this year, standing for
reelection, he found himself compelled to move not to the center but
to his left.</TE>
<TE>   Partly, that's a function of the Legislature itself. Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton, a tough and crafty San Francisco
liberal, is the driving force behind many of the bills that vex
Davis' sleep.</TE>
<TE>   But Burton's not acting by himself. Bay Area legislators have been
famously liberal for decades. In Los Angeles over the last five
years, with the considerable assistance of a revitalized labor
movement, liberals have consistently defeated more centrist
candidates in one Democratic primary after another. And with the new
reapportionment creating safe Democratic districts across the state,
this year's March primaries featured contests far from the state's
two major metropolises in which Democrats backed by labor and
environmental groups defeated Democrats backed by energy companies
and other corporate donors in half a dozen open Assembly seats.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, however, California's leftward march isn't the result
of liberals' legislative legerdemain. It's Californians as a whole
who have changed.</TE>
<TE>   To begin with, over the last decade a lot of Californians up and
left -- taking the old California of Nixon, Jarvis and Reagan with
them. With the collapse of aerospace that followed the end of the
Cold War, and the elimination of hundreds of thousands of
middle-income jobs, 2 million Californians left for other states.
California continued to grow, of course, filling up with millions of
immigrants chiefly from Mexico, Central America and East Asia.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's support for Proposition
187, which sought to deny public services to illegal immigrants --
adults and children alike -- shocked the Latino community, which in
turn prompted a massive effort (with the assistance of the Latino-led
Los Angeles labor movement) to naturalize and register Latinos, who
then voted Democratic. Since 187, the Latino share of the electorate
has been steadily growing -- from 9% in 1992 to 15% two years ago to
a projected 17% next Tuesday. What's important to realize is that
it's not just a preponderantly Democratic electorate. It's a liberal
electorate, too.</TE>
<TE>   In their support for a series of ballot measures since the
mid-'90s -- raising the minimum wage, approving school bonds,
protecting unions' right to participate in elections -- Latinos have
shown themselves to be the most liberal group in the state on
questions of economic equity and opportunity, even more than African
Americans. Now, a new nationwide poll from the Pew Hispanic Center
underscores the depth of Latino exceptionalism.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether they supported bigger government with high taxes and
more services or smaller government with lower taxes and fewer
services, whites preferred the smaller government by a margin of 61%
to 32%; blacks preferred it by 52% to 39%. Latinos actually favored
bigger government, by a margin of 55% to 38%. This is one reason why
Jarvis' anti-statist California is no longer with us, and why the
kind of school bonds routinely rejected throughout the '80s are
routinely enacted today.</TE>
<TE>   On cultural questions, Latinos, like most heavily immigrant groups
throughout U.S. history, have hewed to more traditionalist
perspectives, but this affords little opening to the GOP. Most
Latinos are anti-choice, but it's not an important political question
for them. Fifty-eight percent told the Pew pollsters that education
was either the first or second most important issue to them; 39% said
the economy. A scant 4% said abortion.</TE>
<TE>   The changing orientation of white voters has been the other key to
California's metamorphosis. As John Judis and Ruy Teixeira
demonstrate in their new book, "The Emerging Democratic Majority,"
the more conservative and socially traditional workforce in aerospace
has been supplanted by a more creative and socially liberal workforce
in industries like motion pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it's the regions of Los Angeles where aerospace declined
the most that have been the scenes of the greatest political
transformation. Burbank and Glendale, home to thousands of Lockheed
Martin workers and a solid Republican terrain since the 1910s,
shifted Democratic at all levels of government by 2000 after Lockheed
left and the studios and immigrant populations expanded. Ditto Long
Beach, where the downsizing of the once-immense McDonnell-Douglas
plant and the coming of gay and immigrant communities handed that
terrain to Democrats as well.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it's the transformation of Los Angeles County, home to 30%
of California's population, that has been pushing the transformation
of the state. In 2000, L.A. County voted for presidential candidate
Al Gore at the same rate as the seven counties of the San Francisco
Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Since when did L.A. become as liberal as S.F.? In 1988, L.A.
County cast 52.1% of its vote for Michael Dukakis -- 4.3 percentage
points higher than the figure for the state as a whole. In '92, it
gave Bill Clinton 52.5% support, 6.5 points higher than the state. In
'96, Clinton won 59.3% of the L.A. County vote -- 8.2 points higher
than the state. And in 2000, Gore pulled down 63.5% of the local
tally, 10 points over the state figure.</TE>
<TE>   Look at these figures and you understand why secession will flop
on Tuesday. The white-backlash voters who made Sam Yorty mayor in the
'60s and who were the shock troops for Proposition 13 in 1978 don't
live here anymore. In the 2000 census, Los Angeles -- the most WASP
of large American cities straight through the mid-20th century -- was
the least white of the eight largest American cities (29.8%), and the
whites who lived here were a pretty liberal bunch, too.</TE>
<TE>   Does this mean it's curtains for California Republicans? Not
necessarily, but the magic words "Arnold Schwarzenegger" will not in
themselves raise the party from the ashes. Schwarzenegger and his
party will need to learn what Gov. George Pataki learned in New York:
When you're the Republican governor of a heavily Democratic, liberal
state, you have to be pro-union, support social spending and
environmental protections -- you have to govern, in a word, like a
Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   California Republicans have shown themselves allergic to
candidates who stray even a few steps down this road, as Richard
Riordan can attest. Maybe Schwarzenegger can cow them into
submission; he'll have to if he's to have a shot at the statehouse
four years hence.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, contemplate the new California. The state that's home
to the world's sixth-largest economy is much more diverse and
tolerant than the nation as a whole. It shuns the politics of the
gun-and-Bible belt. With an increasingly assertive immigrant working
class and a powerful labor movement, it is rigging new safety nets
even as the national government seems bent on shredding the old ones.</TE>
<TE>   In short, even as a White House filled with xenophobic provincials
casts a cold eye on a more statist and liberal Europe, a more statist
and liberal California is taking shape right on the Pacific coast --
with 55 electoral votes, no less. It's another country out here, and
a better one.</TE>

Latin America program at the Council on Foreign Relations.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. neglect of Mexico, and of the Western Hemisphere in general, has
begun to take its toll on U.S. interests. After President Bush
indefinitely put off Mexican President Vicente Fox's immigration
initiative last week, Mexico announced that it would use its seat on
the U.N. Security Council and vote with France to soften the
U.S.-sponsored Iraq resolution. Had the White House kept Mexico --
all of Latin America -- higher up on its post-Sept. 11 agenda, might
the Security Council vote of another ally still be in play?</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the Bush administration exhibits little concern
over the potential consequences of neglecting Latin America. Judging
by the White House National Security Strategy, which sets the tone
and course for U.S. foreign policy, it still hails the 1990s formula
of free trade, economic liberalization and democratic politics as
Latin America's fastest ticket to prosperity and freedom.
Predictably, the only significant addition to the document relevant
to the region has a terrorist spin: The formula reputedly can also
weaken terrorism's appeal to the poor.</LD>
<TE>   Be that as it may, the overall strategy perpetuates Washington's
"80/20" problem. Presumably, the U.S. promoted trade, economic
integration and free enterprise not because these policies would
benefit the wealthiest 20% in Latin America. It was the bottom 80%,
living in poverty and scraping by in the informal economy, that
liberalization was supposed to help. But inequality in Latin America
is worse today than it was 10 years ago in almost every country.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, whose exports have increased dramatically because of
the North American Free Trade Agreement, the middle class is ravaged,
poverty and crime have worsened, and the once-thriving maquiladora
sector is bleeding jobs to Asia. Yes, billions of investment dollars
that followed the Clinton administration's intervention in the 1994
peso crisis have created pockets of wealth. Most Mexicans, however,
have yet to experience the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Only Chile has cut poverty by half in the last 10 years, and that
success has more to do with the post-Pinochet solidarity of its
citizenry and the fiscally conservative policies of its center-left
government than free-market economics.</TE>
<TE>   In the remainder of Latin America, the lack of meaningful benefits
from more open economies and less state control have sparked
political and social backlashes. Luckily, the democratic way is
established enough to accommodate the political unhappiness of the
millions who have been left on the economic sidelines. But the
results have not pleased Washington: Hugo Chavez in Venezuela; Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva in Brazil; a representative of coca-growing
peasants nearly winning the presidency in Bolivia and now heading the
largest opposition in both houses of Congress; and leftist
presidential candidates gaining in Ecuador and Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Central to the 80/20 problem is the skewed nature of U.S.
knowledge of the region. I recently asked a U.S. government official
to assess the reach of Cuba's social services in Venezuela. He had no
idea, because Venezuela's poor -- 80% of the country -- remain
virtually "impenetrable" to the United States. It was a refreshingly
frank acknowledgment of the fact that most Americans, whether
governmental or private, talk to basically the same people -- their
peers -- in the top 20%. Accordingly, over the years, they have
acquired and transmitted to Washington a highly distorted view of
"the street" in Latin America. Conversations with taxi drivers at
airports or hotel maids hardly balance the profile. Thus, the U.S.
political class has largely set Latin American policy priorities
according to knowledge mostly gleaned from people who already enjoy
economic success and political power.</TE>
<TE>   The consequences are clear. Forty-one years ago, when Cubans
rallied around Fidel Castro to defeat a U.S.-backed invasion force,
Washington was surprised and humiliated. It had entirely misjudged
the breadth of support for the revolution. Why? Because, just as
today, American diplomats, intelligence agents, journalists and
businesspeople talked mainly to their Latin American counterparts or
to the political opposition, rather than to Castro backers.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. circle of contacts in Latin America has expanded since
the 1960s, but when it comes to the admittedly hard work of getting a
handle on the diversity of experience and views in the region,
Washington still hears too few voices. One holdover from the McCarthy
era is a strong bias against the on-the-ground reporting that
international and local nongovernmental organizations can provide.
Whether involved in human rights, humanitarian relief, labor, the
environment, health or education, NGOs frequently have their fingers
on the pulses of the poor and politically marginalized. Yet,
especially in the self-censoring environment of today's U.S. debates
on Latin American policy, individuals and institutions with a direct
sense of what shakes for the forsaken 80% are often dismissed as
insufficiently independent.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder that the prospect of a number of left-of-center
governments taking power in the region provokes fear in Washington.
Recently, old-line ideological conservatives in the United States and
Latin America warned that Lula, Chavez, Castro and their supporters,
with a little help from the rebels in Colombia, will deliver South
America to the anti-American narco-terrorist dark side. But with the
Soviet Union history, Cuba no longer arming insurgencies but instead
sponsoring peace talks, and only one superpower calling the shots,
what is the real fear? Chavez aggravates Washington, but his oil
still flows to the U.S. And despite their torturous political and
economic problems, neither Chavez nor Lula is flirting with old-style
statist alternatives. Domestic politics and international economic
forces won't indulge such temptations.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. hand-wringing over "populism" -- code for the disorganized
poor gaining a political voice -- is thus a convenient distraction
from the far more difficult challenge of giving breathing space to
local solutions that, in questioning the reformist orthodoxy, strive
for a greater balance between market forces and state intervention.
With Colombia, Haiti and Argentina in partial collapse, Central
America and the Caribbean ridden with crime and increasingly
vulnerable to drugs and thugs, and a newly invigorated electorate
voting anti-establishment candidates in the Amazon and Andes regions,
we can no longer rely on the 20% solution.</TE>

<HD>Neilson's Hockey Camp a Hit in Israel</HD>
<DH>Newest Hall of Fame inductee returns to coaching after
fighting off cancer twice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hal Bock</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When they induct Roger Neilson into the Hockey Hall of Fame on
Monday, it will be a celebration of 25 years in the NHL, a tribute to
a man who has twice fought off cancer and coached eight teams for
1,000 games.</LD>
<LD>   And that doesn't count the kids he worked with in Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Neilson is an eclectic character, always seeking new challenges,
new adventures. Teaching poke checks and slap shots 200 yards from
the Israeli-Lebanese border certainly qualified.</LD>
<TE>   "I enjoy anything like that," Neilson said. "I had been there two
or three times as a tourist. It has the most exciting history you
could imagine over 50 years, getting a country organized, constantly
having to defend it."</TE>
<TE>   That appealed to Neilson's free spirit. So when he was asked if
he'd be interested in setting up one of his summer hockey camps
there, he accepted immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has one top-flight rink in Metulla, a tiny northern town
that sits in a precarious spot, with Syria on one side and Lebanon on
the other. Canada Centre is an Olympic-sized facility with all the
amenities. The climate is good. The ice is better. A perfect place,
Neilson thought.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at a map, it's a sliver of land that goes straight up
into Lebanon," he said. "They've got a 12-foot fence around the
town."</TE>
<TE>   Unconcerned by the geography, Neilson put together a staff of
coaches and traveled there for the first time in 1997. It was a
daunting experience.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to a bomb shelter that first year," he said. "There were
planes roaring overhead. It was a little scary. But the Israeli kids
didn't mind at all."</TE>
<TE>   The locals were used to the sights and sounds of war, and shrugged
them off. Neilson's group of Canadians were a bit more taken aback.
Slowly, though, the visitors became accustomed to the interruptions.</TE>
<TE>   The kids were eager to learn and Neilson loved the teaching,
something he has done all his life. Occasionally, his students would
have other matters on their plate in that troubled land. "One guy is
a fighter pilot now, in for three years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Neilson understands when some people look askance at the idea of
taking hockey to a troubled region such as the Middle East, where
anything might happen at anytime. The rink in Haifa was destroyed by
a missile during the Persian Gulf War. He also understood when one
tough guy NHL player, whom he won't name, got a look at one bad
bombing on TV and backed out of the trip at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   "That's up to them," he said. "They miss out. The rest of us went.
We've been to the Sea of Galilee. We've been to bunkers in the Golan
Heights. One of the officers, a Gen. Patton type, spoke to our kids
and educated them about the problems."</TE>
<TE>   NHL players Bill Lindsay, Dainius Zubrus and Steve Dubinsky made
the trip following Neilson, who has coached just about everywhere and
now works as an assistant with the Ottawa Senators.</TE>
<TE>   There have been head coaching stints with Philadelphia, Florida,
the New York Rangers, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Buffalo, Toronto and,
for the final two games last season, Ottawa. That was a gesture by
the team to permit him to reach his 1,000th game as a head coach, a
plateau only eight others have achieved. In 15 seasons as a head
coach, Neilson has taken teams to the playoffs 11 times.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is the cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Neilson was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, bone marrow cancer,
in December 1999. He underwent successful stem cell transplant in
2000. In January 2001, he was diagnosed with malignant melanoma, skin
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   He shrugs off questions about his health, saying only, "Everything
is going well."</TE>
<TE>   It will certainly not prevent him from joining Monday's Hall of
Fame celebration with the other inductees -- ex-players Bernie
Federko, Clark Gillies and Rod Langway.</TE>
<TE>   Rising tensions in Israel caused postponements of Neilson's
journeys the last two years, but he promises to return.</TE>
<TE>   Last April, he received a letter from Judith Javor, secretary of
the Israel Ice Skating Federation.</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'Get over here. All that stuff on CNN is baloney,' "
Neilson said. "We'll be back."</TE>

<HD>Brown Turning Into Huge Presence in the Middle</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Michael Wilbon</AU>
<BD>The Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- It's a stunning reversal, from last year to this,
really from April to October. Even deep into the summer, word on the
street was that Kwame Brown was getting handled. He was getting
schooled by young pros who live in the D.C. area in the offseason,
even by some of the University of Maryland players. The Wizards'
coaches and veterans thought Brown was overweight just before camp
began. There was no outward hint that the first high school kid to be
drafted No. 1 overall was about to stop being a bust and become a
monster.</LD>
<LD>   But that's what has happened, virtually overnight. OK, it's only
two games. And as Brown was quick to say, "I'm not about to get a big
head when we've got 80 more games to play." But still, the
transformation is unbelievable.</LD>
<LD>   After a 12-point, 18-rebound, five-block performance in the season
opener at Toronto Wednesday night, Doug Collins said he told his
coaches, "This'll be a great challenge, to see how Kwame does in a
back-to-back situation."</LD>
<TE>   Well, here's how Brown did: 20 points on eight-for-12 shooting,
six rebounds and six blocked shots. That's 11 blocked shots in two
games. There aren't five players in the NBA who can block 11 shots in
two games.</TE>
<TE>   It's the early shocker of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes," Collins said, "you just don't know what clicks. You
just don't."</TE>
<TE>   "He's relieved, I'm relieved, I think everybody's relieved,"
Michael Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to prove over and over again in his career why he was
picked number one in the draft," Celtics Coach Jim O'Brien said.</TE>
<TE>   The kid still doesn't have much of a game. He doesn't have any pet
moves, isn't a great shooter. Yet, there were little stretches last
night when he was the most dominant force on the floor, swatting and
changing shots, filling the lane, harassing Celtics into bad
decisions. "He was all over the place," Jordan said. "He's
infectious."</TE>
<TE>   On a night when the Wizards played as fine a game as their
demanding coach could possibly ask for, a whole lot went right. The
Wizards handed Boston the most lopsided loss in Celtics history.
Jerry Stackhouse showed just how far he's come as an offensive
player, handing out 10 assists while committing only three turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, the Icon, scored 21 points in 22 minutes vs. a team he
struggled against last season. Jared Jeffries, the 6-foot-11 rookie,
showed he will soon be a smooth, box-score filling player with feel
and intelligence in his game, not to mention a wonderful demeanor.
Tyronn Lue showed he has some playmaking ability to go with his
three-point shooting and harassing defense.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even with all that, Brown's the story on the Wizards.
Brown's the one who sent people home shaking their heads.</TE>
<TE>   And to think, late last March Collins noticed that Brown's face
had broken out, that the kid was exhibiting noticeable signs of
stress, even if he didn't know it.</TE>
<TE>   So what happened?</TE>
<TE>   He's growing up.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it's that simple, and even he knows it. "NBA life is so
difficult," Brown said afterward. "Last year, I would get tired from
just traveling. It's not like a high school trip, where you take a
bus trip, play the game, and go home that night. I didn't know how to
play the game. ... Last year I was so robotic. If a play broke down I
didn't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   Collins gets a huge assist for realizing last spring his
impatience wasn't helping matters. And while Charles Oakley and
Patrick Ewing haven't been here long, they also get a big assist for
Brown's recent improvement.</TE>
<TE>   One guy who deserves a bigger slice of credit, whose name you
won't often hear, is Duane Ferrell. The former Georgia Tech star and
NBA forward was brought on as the director of player programs. Last
year, that meant baby-sitting Brown.</TE>
<TE>   It fell to Ferrell to teach Brown how a professional athlete
should eat, sleep, travel. Ferrell showed Brown how to pack, told him
how long pre-game naps should be. Ferrell had to beg Collins and
Jordan, two of the most impatient men by nature you'll meet, to back
off now and then, to pat Brown on the back instead of kick him in the
butt.</TE>
<TE>   There was no blueprint because no team in NBA history had ever
taken a high school kid with the first pick in the draft. They were
all flying blind. Ferrell was certain he could see the future. The
signing of Oakley and Ewing was like the arrival of the cavalry.</TE>
<TE>   "Charles is always in my ear," Brown said. "If I slip up one bit,
I hear it. If I go five minutes without hearing something from
Charles, something's wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that's not how Oakley sees it. Oakley, though he is
still active and will have to contribute on the court this season,
has done this kind of mentoring in Toronto and Chicago. But he knows
when to push, and when to hug. "I told him to prove to people why
he's the number one pick," Oakley said. "Does he listen to me? I
don't know what he did in another class, but when you come to my
class it's full attention."</TE>
<TE>   Collins told Oakley he's not sure how many minutes Oakley will
play early in this season, but added, "You can do more for that young
guy than I could ever do."</TE>
<TE>   This is why Oakley, if he doesn't score a point or grab a rebound
this month, is worth his weight in gold for this franchise.</TE>
<TE>   So what now? Won't we expect Brown to start rebounding, scoring
and blocking shots with regularity? Is he ready for those heavy
expectations? "I'll tell him," Jordan said, "that now the thing is
that everybody will expect everything. You've got to be ready to do
it every single night." Two nights is a long way from consistently,
but it's a start.</TE>
<TE>   At his cubicle in the locker room, Brown said, "I'm gaining these
guys' respect and trust." Eight months ago, it seemed that basic
relationship might take two more years to build, if not more.
Suddenly, it seems possible Brown may earn that respect and trust
much sooner, maybe even now.</TE>

<HD>Rice Faces Former Team for First Time</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Janie McCauley</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>It's hours before kickoff. Jerry Rice is alone on the Coliseum grass,
running through his structured warm-up routine.</LD>
<LD>   A sprint here, a zigzag there, a stretch in between.</LD>
<LD>   It's exactly the way the 40-year-old receiver has prepared for as
long as he can remember, since he came into the league back in 1985
with the San Francisco 49ers. Now, playing with the Oakland Raiders
on the other side of San Francisco Bay, he's set to suit up for his
first regular-season game against his old team since leaving after
the 2000 season.</LD>
<TE>   "I can try to downplay it, but you know, I'm going against my old
team, and I want to play well. I want the Black Hole to be just nasty
this week," Rice said, referring to the rowdy group of Raiders fans
who sit behind the south end zone.</TE>
<TE>   He could get career touchdown No. 200 -- he scored the first 186
with the 49ers -- by reaching the end zone once on Sunday. Yet that
doesn't matter as much to Rice as helping get the Raiders back on
track following three straight losses after a 4-0 start.</TE>
<TE>   Beating his old team would just make it that much sweeter.</TE>
<TE>   For so long now, Rice has been Bay area football. He's been able
to perform at close to the same level at age 40 as he did early in
his career, thanks to a demanding physical regimen.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers could still use Rice. With underachieving J.J. Stokes
and unproven Tai Streets as their only receiving threats beyond
Terrell Owens, San Francisco is lacking a dependable No. 2 wideout.</TE>
<TE>   "He's put the time and effort into staying healthy, and you see it
on the field," 49ers quarterback Jeff Garcia said. "He's looked as if
he hasn't lost any steps. He's looking even better than he did the
last two years here, actually."</TE>
<TE>   When the Niners let Rice go two years ago, they said they couldn't
pay him what he was worth. They also wanted to see what Stokes and
Streets could do with added responsibility. Rice insists he isn't
holding a grudge. He appreciates that he got a fresh start.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing against those guys," Rice said. "I have nothing
against the coaches. They did me a great favor because it gave me a
chance to rejuvenate myself. There's no animosity or anything.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, when you snap that chin strap on, it's all about going out
there and making plays and putting your team into position."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci would like there to be a way
for teams to hold onto such key veterans.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had so many salary cap casualties around here, and it's
sad," Mariucci said. "I wish we could work something out where you
wouldn't have to let a guy like that go. We had to move on for a lot
of reasons."</TE>

<HD>Players Learning to Tackle Cleanly</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>John Lynch, Tampa Bay's perennial Pro Bowl safety, was fined early in
his career for a helmet-to-helmet hit.</LD>
<LD>   "That's the way I was taught," Lynch complained to Rich McKay, the
team's general manager.</LD>
<LD>   "Then learn the other way," replied McKay, who as co-chairman of
the NFL's competition committee had a major role in developing the
league's safety policy.</LD>
<TE>   In a season when fines and suspensions for dangerous hits are
being emphasized as never before, Lynch is one safety who hasn't been
disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   But the crackdown on unsafe hits is making many defenders unlearn
what they've been taught since childhood: turn themselves into guided
missiles heading straight for receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Disciplinary action for overzealous hitting isn't up much this
season, with 18 fines or suspensions compared to 16 a year ago. But
the league re-emphasized its get-tough policies at its meetings in
New York this week after two helmet hits in high-profile games.</TE>
<TE>   It fined Dallas safety Darren Woodson $75,000 for a hit on Seattle
wide receiver Darrell Jackson last Sunday in the game in which Emmitt
Smith passed Walter Payton for the career rushing record. Jackson
later had a seizure in the locker room and was hospitalized
overnight.</TE>
<TE>   The next night, Philadelphia safety Brian Dawkins leveled New York
Giants receiver Ike Hilliard. Hilliard separated a shoulder and is
out for the season. Dawkins was fined $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The players understand that a violent hit helmet-to-helmet is
going to cost some money and potentially cost the team a penalty,"
says Tennessee Coach Jeff Fisher, a former NFL defensive back who
with McKay is co-chairman of the competition committee.</TE>
<TE>   "Beyond that you have to play the game. You cannot back down and
not play the game the way it's supposed to be played, It's supposed
to be played from a physical perspective."</TE>
<TE>   That's the point made by some players who have been disciplined,
notably San Diego's Rodney Harrison, one of the top safeties in the
game and one of the most disciplined players ever.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison has 11 infractions dating to 1997, with fines and lost
pay for suspensions totaling $229,264. That includes the $111,764 he
will lose after being suspended for this week's game with the New
York Jets for a hit on Oakland's Jerry Rice.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be completely unintentional," Harrison says. "All of a
sudden, right before a receiver catches the ball, he may see you out
of his peripheral vision and his natural reaction is to tuck to
protect himself. So naturally he brings his head down. And if he
brings his head down, guys can bump helmets. It may be completely
unintentional."</TE>
<TE>   There are team officials who agree.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Millen, president of the Detroit Lions, played 12 seasons as
a linebacker for the Raiders, 49ers and Redskins, and says he was
taught from age 8 to lead with his head going after a receiver.</TE>
<TE>   "It's instinct and momentum," he says. "You don't think. You
react."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, said that when he played
at Arkansas in the early 1960s he was taught the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   Jones changed his tune within 48 hours this week.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, after the 15-yard penalty on Woodson helped move
Seattle into position to kick the winning field goal against his
Cowboys, Jones complained the call was a bad one. That was before he
knew of Jackson's injury.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, after a stern talk from commissioner Paul
Tagliabue at the owners' meetings, Jones was saying something else.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize that safety is primary," he said. "It's hard for a
defensive back not to hit a defenseless receiver, but it has to be
done."</TE>
<TE>   Denver safety Kenoy Kennedy, who has been fined twice and
suspended once for hits this season, suggests that at the same time
the NFL is cracking down, hard hits are being glamorized on
television.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how the guys in the past made their living, laying guys
out," Kennedy says.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to see your counterparts like that, lying on the
ground helpless. But even though you get suspended, they'll still be
on highlight films. They put them on NFL crunch tapes. It's kind of
confusing. You want to go out and be aggressive. Football is an
aggressive sport.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying they're taking all the fun out of it, but they are
watching out for the safety of the guys."</TE>

**** Makings of a classic
*** Smash-mouth football
** Good for an end around
* Strictly fantasy fodder
** Baltimore (3-4) at Atlanta (4-3), 10 a.m.: Michael Vick has become
such a dangerous weapon at quarterback, even Ray Lewis probably isn't
that broken up over the shoulder injury that will keep him sidelined.
LINE: Atlanta by 7 1/2
*** New England (3-4) at Buffalo (5-3), 10 a.m., KNX (1070): Former
Patriot quarterback Drew Bledsoe is next on the agenda for struggling
New England. Can't imagine many in the Northeast will want to read
the minutes after this meeting. LINE: Buffalo by 2 1/2
** Philadelphia (5-2) at Chicago (2-5), 10 a.m., Channel 11: When
Bears had best defense last season, Donovan McNabb led Eagles to 33
points, 299 yards passing and a playoff victory. These days, Chicago
defense is weak and McNabb is better than ever. LINE: Philadelphia by
6 1/2
*** Pittsburgh (4-3) at Cleveland (4-4), 10 a.m.: Browns still
kicking themselves over Week 3 loss to Steelers, but Cleveland
linebacker/philosopher Kenard Lang refuses to lament the defeat: "If
ifs and buts were candy and nuts, every day would be Christmas."
LINE: Pittsburgh by 3
* Dallas (3-5) at Detroit (2-5), 10 a.m.: Just think: If Barry
Sanders hadn't retired three years ago, this might be a matchup of
the Nos. 1 and 2 all-time leading rushers with Emmitt Smith playing
second fiddle. LINE: Detroit by 3
*** Cincinnati (0-7) at Houston (2-5), 10 a.m.: In light of Bengal
Coach Dick LeBeau's victory guarantee and the fact that the
oddsmakers actually favor the Texans, Houston Coach Dom Capers points
to sign above locker room door: "Deeds, not words." LINE: Houston by
3
** Tennessee (3-4) at Indianapolis (4-3), 10 a.m.: The bad news for
the Colts: Eddie George has consecutive 100-yard rushing efforts.
Worse news for the Colts: Four of their eight players listed as
questionable or doubtful this week are defensive linemen. LINE:
Indianapolis by 3
** Minnesota (2-5) at Tampa Bay (6-2), 10 a.m.: By changing hotels
and imposing an earlier curfew, Viking Coach Mike Tice doing
everything he can to minimize distractions. What he forgets is that
he has a bad team. LINE: Tampa Bay by 7
*** New York Jets (2-5) at San Diego (6-1), 1 p.m., Channel 2: Of the
Chargers' bye week, Marcellus Wiley said: "A lot of guys ... ate a
lot of good food and came back fat." In next breath he says, "A lot
of guys are thirsty for another game." Thank goodness they aren't
hungry. LINE: San Diego by 7 1/2
** St. Louis (2-5) at Arizona (4-3), 1:15 p.m., KLAC (570), KLSX-FM
(97.1): Cardinal defense gives up only 3.5 yards per rush. Marshall
Faulk has rushed for 393 yards in 60 carries (6.6 yards per carry) in
the last two games. Something has to give. LINE: St. Louis by 3
**** San Francisco (5-2) at Oakland (4-3), 1:15 p.m., Channel 11,
KMPC (1540), KNX (1070): In this Bay Area battle between the
wine-and-cheese 49er fans and blue-collar Raider backers, wouldn't
Barry Bonds be perfect to throw out the ceremonial sour grape? LINE:
Oakland by 3
** Washington (3-4) at Seattle (2-5), 1:15 p.m.: Quarterbacks will be
the story one way or another. Matt Hasselbeck is back in the fold for
Seahawks after injury to Trent Dilfer as Jeff George waits in wings.
As for Redskins, Shane Matthews drew the short straw this week. LINE:
Seattle by 3
** Jacksonville (3-4) at New York Giants (3-4), 5:30 p.m., ESPN,
KLSX-FM (97.1): Boy, think about all that's at stake in this one: The
winner can still convince itself for another week that it actually
has a chance to make a difference in the postseason. Wow. LINE: New
York by 3
**** Miami (5-2) at Green Bay (6-1), Monday, 6 p.m., Channel 7, KNX
(1070): Will Brett Favre play? In his career, the Packer quarterback
has been knocked out of a game three times and the next week he
returned. His numbers in those games? 719 yards passing, eight
touchdowns and a 3-0 record. LINE: Green Bay by 4
Open date: Carolina, Denver, Kansas City, New Orleans</TE>

<HD>Hail to Incomparable Vick, He Soon May Have No Peer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Oates</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The time may already be here when it's possible to think of Michael
Vick, the Atlanta Falcons' young quarterback, as the game's finest
football player.</LD>
<LD>   Vick, a smooth-throwing left-hander, plays the NFL game with
unique speed. And in only his ninth start as a pro, he'll show the
Baltimore Ravens that today.</LD>
<LD>   His quicksilver mobility made the difference last week when his
swiftness afoot, combined with his transience in the pocket, led to
the 37-35 upset of the New Orleans Saints.</LD>
<TE>   And eventually, when Atlanta (4-3) moves past New Orleans (6-2)
and Tampa Bay (6-2) to the top of the NFC South -- as soon, maybe, as
this year -- it will be Vick's arm and speed that carries the
Falcons.</TE>
<TE>   On most plays last week, the Saints could see him, presumably, but
they couldn't catch him. Not often. And when it was time to throw, he
threw straight.</TE>
<TE>   Great athletes, many of them nearly matching Vick in football
talent, are all over the place. Vick's edge, at 6 feet and 215
pounds, is simply that he does more things with more excellence than
any peer. An accomplished passer who performs with the intuition of a
good coach, he scrambles punctually, throws accurately on a scramble,
and runs with the speed and talent of an all-pro running back.</TE>
<TE>   Handoff Specialist?</TE>
<TE>   The negative in Atlanta is that Vick's natural way of playing
football isn't really compatible with that of Falcon Coach Dan
Reeves, whose conservative instincts tend to inhibit freewheelers. In
Reeves' football, you still run to set up the pass.</TE>
<TE>   Thus on first-down plays last week, relegating Vick to a handoff
specialist, Reeves usually asked running back Warrick Dunn to hit the
line, regardless of where the Falcons were positioned.</TE>
<TE>   Vick was born to play another kind of football, pass-first
football, even though, after failed runs, he's more effective on
second and 10 or third and nine than most passers. And in the last
two minutes in New Orleans -- with Reeves reduced to no other option
-- Vick got to play his game on the eight-play, field-goal drive that
won it.</TE>
<TE>   Starting from his 12-yard line with the Falcons one point in
arrears, he advanced the ball with completions or scrambles on every
play but one. On that one, he spiked it. Then, after one last
scramble, a nauseated Vick left the field. As the clock ran down
while the Falcons milled around with substitute quarterback Doug
Johnson, Vick reacted like an experienced coach.</TE>
<TE>   Standing on the sideline, he yelled, "Spike the ball!" With four
seconds left, Johnson finally did. Then Jay Feely kicked it 47 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the day's great plays were Vick's touchdown runs of three
and 32 yards. He seemed to be Gale Sayers reincarnated.</TE>
<TE>   Griese Punished</TE>
<TE>   The difference between Vick and Denver passer Brian Griese, who,
Eastern analysts predict, has the Broncos lined up for the Super
Bowl, is that Griese is too slow to avoid the pounding that often
afflicts those heavily rushed.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after the Broncos (6-2) had impressed the West with a
26-9 runaway over San Diego (6-1) in Week 5, they impressed the East
with an easy 24-16 decision in Week 8 at New England, where Griese
extended his touchdown-pass streak.</TE>
<TE>   This season as usual, however, he has been pounded more often than
he has thrown for touchdowns. Spectators winced again last Sunday
whenever Griese couldn't get the ball off. On failed pass plays,
blitzers and other pass rushers jumped on him as usual until,
sometimes, they blotted him out of sight. That has to hurt.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Vick has a knack for evading pass rushers that keeps
him relatively unharmed. In this aspect of the job he is unusual, if
not unique. He accelerates away from an onrushing blitzer with a
speed burst that resembles that of a sprinter taking off on a spring
day. He is, to be sure, sacked on occasion. But he is seldom
punished.</TE>
<TE>   As every pro fan knows, Griese hasn't been the season's only
statue-like victim of NFL pass rushers. Heavy hits happen to all
quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   The carnage is, at once, one of the best and worst things about
pro football, whose defensive players, to succeed, must punish.</TE>
<TE>   But the most vicious hits are reserved for the quarterbacks who
aren't fast enough to get out of their own way. Conspicuous examples,
besides Griese, are quarterbacks Brad Johnson of Tampa and Kurt
Warner of the Rams. That's why the more nimble Vick should go a long
way in this league.</TE>
<TE>   Fining Pays Off</TE>
<TE>   How much will the NFL have to fine San Diego strong safety Rodney
Harrison to make him stop hitting people improperly? Over the years,
the league has taken Harrison for more than two-fifths of a million
dollars in fines -- and still, he keeps attacking unsuspecting and
often defenseless opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, he was suspended for a week without pay --
estimated to be the equivalent of a fine of more than $110,000 -- for
a head-to-head hit on Oakland receiver Jerry Rice. And, the
disciplinary executives hope, that will help.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison, by order of the league, is scheduled to sit out today's
game against the New York Jets. That will punish the whole San Diego
defense -- and by extension San Diego's many football fans. My
recommendation would be a $200,000 fine and let him play.</TE>
<TE>   The most valuable and important thing about all this, though, is
that Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and his associates are
conscientiously dealing out strong punishment for extraneous
punishment.</TE>
<TE>   And that promotes football both competitively and as a spectator
attraction. In almost every game now, you see pass rushers
approaching the passer at full speed -- bent on the sacks that mean
so much to sackers financially and to their employers competitively
-- only to pull up at the last instant if the pass has been thrown.</TE>
<TE>   It seems like yesterday that defensive linemen and linebackers
joined in insisting that in a fast-moving rush on the passer, it was
impossible for them to pull up. You don't hear much of that now. They
are playing properly, now, most of them -- and still getting their
sacks.</TE>
<TE>   That, however, prompts the question: How much will Harrison be
fined before he learns to behave? We'll see.</TE>
<TE>   Five Guesses</TE>
<TE>   NFL teams are evenly matched this season, making every weekend a
guessing game. So let's play it. Here are five guesses on five key
games today and Monday night:</TE>
<TE>   * San Francisco to win by six over Oakland, the favorite at
Oakland. The question is whether Raider quarterback Rich Gannon can
rekindle his once flaming offense in time to take advantage of the
vulnerable 49er defense.</TE>
<TE>   * St. Louis by seven over Arizona at Tempe: The Cardinals are
beginning to make some noise with an offense that outscored the 49ers
in the second half last week, 21-7. But Ram third-stringer Marc
Bulger seems more quarterback than Cardinal first-stringer Jake
Plummer.</TE>
<TE>   * New England by three over Buffalo, the favorite at Buffalo. In a
matchup of former New England teammates, Drew Bledsoe of the Bills is
both the sentimental and actual favorite over Tom Brady of the
Patriots. Bledsoe has an enormous advantage in receivers with, first
of all, Eric Moulds. The continuous inability of New England's new
young receivers to get open is beating Brady this year. In the ninth
week of the schedule, if they're ever going to acclimatize, today's
the time.</TE>
<TE>   * Pittsburgh by one over Cleveland at Cleveland Browns Stadium.
Even in Ohio, they expect Tommy Maddox of the Steelers to outplay Tim
Couch in this battle of new quarterbacks extending an old regional
rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   * Green Bay by three over Miami on Monday night at Lambeau Field:
Against the Dolphin defense, Packer quarterback Brett Favre won't
have a romp of the kind he has grown used to this season. But the
question is obvious: Has Miami, during a bye week, been able to
develop an offense capable of scoring just a few points? A little dab
might do it.</TE>

<HD>Jordan's Leap: Washed Up to Ageless Wonder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph White</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>He drove around defenders with ease and did a little high-step when
he made his jump shots. He scored a point for every minute he played.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Jordan may be 39, but who could tell on this night? His
game had all the compelling elements of years past -- flow, rhythm,
aggression, confidence.</LD>
<LD>   "That felt good," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The performance during the Washington Wizards' 114-69 victory over
the Boston Celtics on Thursday came a night after Jordan missed two
free throws and a breakaway dunk in the fourth quarter of a defeat in
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the worst games of his 15-year career, Jordan labored on
the court, looking less like the greatest basketball player ever and
more like an old man who should be doing something else.</TE>
<TE>   The 24-hour turn of events reinforced a Michael Jordan axiom:
Never underestimate his determination to prove his critics wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to stay ahead of all the criticism. That's the driving
force for me," Jordan said on the eve of the season opener against
the Toronto Raptors. "It's not that I can't do it; it's a matter of
doing it at this age."</TE>
<TE>   But at the Air Canada Centre, Jordan seemed as if he were trying
simply to hang on for one more year. The rest of the team that Jordan
assembled over the summer looked almost as bad in the 74-68 loss.</TE>
<TE>   Sports talk shows nationwide spent much of Thursday comparing
Jordan to stars like Willie Mays, who became a sad embarrassment by
playing well past his prime.</TE>
<TE>   They spoke too soon about No. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan scored 21 points in 21 minutes against the Celtics, who
endured the worst regular-season loss in their storied history.</TE>
<TE>   He showed no ill effects from the knee problems that bothered him
all of last season. His four-point sequence at the end of the first
half -- two free throws, stolen inbounds pass, 21-foot jumper,
celebratory cancan kick -- lifted the arena as only Jordan can.</TE>
<TE>   The superstar who led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships
had two reasons to gloat afterward. First, as a proud Wizards
executive: "In terms of what we all envisioned, in putting this team
together, tonight it worked perfectly."</TE>
<TE>   Second, as player, when he was reminded that old friend and
Chicago native Antoine Walker plays for the Celtics: "I can go back
to Chicago with some bragging rights."</TE>
<TE>   Last season -- his first since coming out of retirement for the
second time -- Jordan followed a career-worst six-point game with a
51-point onslaught. The whole season was a roller coaster as he
struggled with his knees and tried to carry a team short on talent.</TE>
<TE>   The game plan has changed this season. To save his knees, Jordan
is a substitute. He can afford to do that because he upgraded the
players around him, adding Jerry Stackhouse, Larry Hughes and Bryon
Russell, among others.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't really write him off," Walker said after Thursday's
game. "He's coming off the bench, so it's going to take him awhile to
get warmed up.</TE>
<TE>   "There are going to be nights when he doesn't play well, and there
are going to be nights when he plays great. But he's going to play
more better games than worse games."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan admitted he overdid his workouts at the expense of his
knees last season. This year, he played in just three of eight
exhibition games, so a bit of rust at the start is expected.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael is a genius as a basketball player," Wizards coach Doug
Collins said. "What he went through last year physically makes him
more aware this year of what we do have to do. He's still working to
get himself in the shape he needs to play."</TE>

<HD>Now You Can Write a Turkey Instead of Cooking One</HD>
<DH>Web site invites all comers to submit 50,000 of their best
-- or worst -- words by the end of the month. No plot? No problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michelle Locke</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Chris Baty doesn't want you to write the Great American Novel. He's
not even asking for the Halfway Good American Novel. Go ahead, write
a book so bad that it's criminal. Just make it at least 50,000 words
and in the language of your choice.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, one other thing. Get it done in 30 days or less.</LD>
<LD>   Baty is founder of National Novel Writing Month, an Internet
writing endeavor in its fourth year that is expected to send
thousands of would-be prose pros into creative hyperdrive this month.</LD>
<TE>   The premise: Everyone really does have at least one book in her or
him.</TE>
<TE>   The precept: No plot? No problem!</TE>
<TE>   "Let's write laughably awful yet lengthy prose together," Baty
invites participants in his disarming Web site come-on.</TE>
<TE>   The idea, he explains, is that pumping out prose at high speed
overrides the deadly second-guessing that keeps many a would-be
writer, and even some successful ones, from typing word one.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you pry that delete key off the computer, it really enables
you to tap into your creativity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A freelance writer living in Oakland, Baty came up with the nimble
novel concept in 1999, when he was abuzz with the caffeinated high of
just finishing a big magazine project. Like so many others, he had
wanted to write a novel, but was intimidated by the effort. On the
Web site, this is known as the one-day novel. As in, "One day I'll
write a novel."</TE>
<TE>   Baty started wondering about what would happen if novel writing
were turned into a social activity that would only last a month and
"then we could be novelists and talk about our work at parties."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-one people signed up the first year, 140 the second. Then,
last year, it was near-disaster as newspapers and bloggers (Web
loggers, or writers of Web diaries) discovered the contest.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, thousands of people showed up at Baty's not very
sophisticated Web site, forcing him to press friends and relatives
into the wrist-bending process of manually entering participant data.
Ice packs were needed.</TE>
<TE>   Adding insult to carpal tunnel injury, a programming slip-up
allowed hackers to get in and put up a photo of a scantily clad young
woman and a rude message. "That was sort of my welcome to the big
time," Baty said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, http://www.nanowrimo.com has a nifty new design and an
automated sign-up system that Baty expects will be able to handle the
anticipated 6,000 to 7,000 participants.</TE>
<TE>   NaNoWriMo has brought Baty a measure of fame, but not too much
cash. So, this year, he's suggesting a $10 donation per entry.</TE>
<TE>   To "win," you write 50,000 words or more, which are to be counted
by an automated program -- Baty has a purple prose protection policy,
promising that no human will actually read the submitted works.</TE>
<TE>   But friends do let friends read NaNoWriMo novels, and Baty has
found "some surprisingly passable, some impressively adequate, none
ready for publication."</TE>
<TE>   Frequently asked questions:</TE>
<TE>   * Has anyone managed to get a NaNoWriMo novel published? Some have
self-published or posted their work on the Internet and at least one,
Jon Merz, has a NaNo novel, "The Destructor," coming out from
Pinnacle Books in March.</TE>
<TE>   * Has anyone famous participated? It appears not, although Baty is
not averse to the idea of starting a rumor to that effect. After all,
who, really, is evilwizard29?</TE>
<TE>   * Can NaNoWriMo help you get your finished novel published? No.
"Our connections to the publishing world end at Kinko's."</TE>
<TE>   Among those who signed up last year was Lauren Ayer, a San
Francisco Bay Area writer. Ayer, who has a day job writing copy for
Internet sites, was struggling with an idea for a novel and looking
for a way "to just blast through the story."</TE>
<TE>   The first week went well. The second week didn't. "All of a
sudden, all the words dry up. You've lost your train of thought. You
have no idea. The plot's not working. The characters don't do what
you want [them] to do." Then, at the end of the second week, the fog
cleared and by Nov. 25, she had a 48,000-word novel. A true pro, she
padded to get to 50,851.</TE>
<TE>   She put the novel away for a month. Then she took it out and began
rewriting. "It was appallingly bad, especially at the beginning," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Ayer is close to finishing her book, "Wake," the
story of what happens to a group of friends after one of them dies.
She hopes to shop the book to an agent.</TE>
<TE>   Ayer, who is game for another go-round this year, was making a
lightheartedly serious attempt at fiction.</TE>
<TE>   Other participants go for the seriously lightweight. As one poster
to a NaNoWriMo forum recently put it: "Is smut a genre?"</TE>
<TE>   Among last year's entries: "Sing Paramecia Sing" and "So I Married
a Ninja."</TE>
<TE>   Adair Lara, who writes the old-fashioned way, took four years to
live through, and four more years to write, a memoir of her
daughter's adolescence, "Hold Me Close, Let Me Go." But Lara, who
teaches writing and writes for the San Francisco Chronicle, doesn't
scoff at the verbosity-over-virtuosity approach.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that can get a person to write 50,000 words in a month
is fabulous," she said. "The words will have to be completely
rewritten, but so will 50,000 words written over a year." Writing
fast and focused "overcomes the paralysis of writer's block and the
need to clean your apartment."</TE>
<TE>   So this month, let others brine turkeys, make pilgrim place cards,
and stir up the toxic concoction of family and togetherness.</TE>
<TE>   Baty and his followers will be lugging laptops to coffee shops and
locking themselves into rooms with no view save the pale glow of a
computer screen, tapping with reckless rapture.</TE>
<TE>   You can make book on it.</TE>

<KH>ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE</KH>
<HD>2 Counties Must Cooperate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County never has been comfortable in the shadow of its big
neighbor to the north. There's long been a desire to look inward and
find, at heart, an independent county -- a cause the Anaheim Angels
championed by correcting geographically challenged Giants fans who
came to town chanting "Beat L.A.!"</LD>
<LD>   Now the county is coming to grips with another neighbor, Riverside
County, and pondering an "us versus them" relationship spun off by a
critical imbalance of jobs being created in this county and the
supply of affordable housing springing up in Riverside.</LD>
<LD>   The situation is painfully evident to Riverside residents who
travel the already-jammed Riverside Freeway and the increasingly busy
Ortega Highway to get to and from jobs in Orange County. We all know
secretaries, office managers, teachers and laborers who make the
dreaded round trip with fingers crossed to ward off SigAlerts.</LD>
<TE>   And the imbalance will grow worse during the next two decades,
according to a report issued in October by the Orange County
Transportation Authority and the Riverside County Transportation
Commission. The problem is that Orange County won't meet projected
employment needs without attracting residents who live in Riverside's
lower-cost housing.</TE>
<TE>   The upshot is that neither county can afford to ignore frustrating
delays on the Riverside Freeway and increased traffic on the narrow,
winding Ortega Highway that stretches from San Juan Capistrano
through the Cleveland National Forest to Lake Elsinore.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, the study concludes, the counties must improve the
flow of traffic or risk stalling the regional economy. That's the
impetus behind proposals to build a second highway alongside the
Riverside Freeway and tunneling through the Santa Ana Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the numbers -- 58 counties, 476 cities and nearly 5,000
special districts -- Californians love government. But regional
issues clearly demand more cooperation. The nonprofit California
Center for Regional Leadership recently put it this way: When it
comes to managing economic growth and the quality of life, "decisions
are best made at the regional level, and state policies and practices
should be reformed and aligned to support better decisions for
improved regional outcomes."</TE>
<TE>   That's a long-winded way of saying that Orange and Riverside
counties must work together to ensure that goods, services and people
travel freely between them so the regional economy can continue to
grow. The two counties have fences to mend. Riverside County
unsuccessfully sued several years ago to open private toll road lanes
on the Riverside Freeway. The report issued earlier this month is one
sign that that mending is underway.</TE>

<HD>City Card Needs Rethinking</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever the entrepreneurial city, Huntington Beach now hopes to drum up
money by issuing credit cards bearing the city's logo.</LD>
<LD>   The city would align with a major credit-card company to offer a
Visa or MasterCard to residents. Huntington Beach would get a small
percentage of the sales charged by residents to help fund parks,
libraries and basic city services. City officials hope merchants will
offer discounts to cardholders; in exchange, merchant advertising
would appear on city posters.</LD>
<LD>   It's a tiny step commercially for a city that already has an
official soft drink and a sponsorship deal with Yamaha personal
watercraft. If the Vegetarian Resource Group can have a Visa card in
its name, why not Surf City?</LD>
<TE>   But before Huntington Beach's City Council goes forward as
expected in January, it should take a look at the tales of other
California cities. Redondo Beach rejected a similar scheme in 1995. A
major concern was whether a public agency should be pushing its
residents to take on more credit when so many consumers are already
overloaded with debt.</TE>
<TE>   That's a valid concern. Cities can make a lot of money on cards
only when people do a lot of spending. There's a big difference
between pushing credit expenditures and slapping ads for household
cleaners on lifeguard towers.</TE>
<TE>   Culver City began pushing affinity credit cards in 1995 but shut
down the operation two years later because it never generated a
profit. People weren't interested in the municipal credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach hopes to pull in $1.2 million a year by getting
up to 50,000 people to sign up for cards. This is in a city with
about 77,000 households, 10% of which earn less than $25,000 a year.
The city thinks its Surf City "brand" will sell even beyond its
borders, especially if a broad band of businesses offers discounts to
cardholders.</TE>
<TE>   The city needs to wake up to marketing realities. After five
years, only 3,000 people carry the San Francisco affinity card, which
brings in an average of $13,000 a year. This is in an upscale tourist
magnet with a population three times the size of Huntington Beach.
San Francisco does not offer exclusive merchant discounts for its
card because studies show they don't work. It's the same in San Diego
County, where the tiny city of Del Mar generates just $2,000 in
annual revenue despite offering merchant discounts. For the most
part, people want cards that carry free air miles, not a free dessert
at a local restaurant. Merchants also risk creating ill will among
customers by offering selective discounts based solely on the buyer's
credit card.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach should move slowly and cautiously before getting
into the business of merchant discounts and credit cards. It must
consider all the issues, ethical and financial--consider them as
carefully as a debt-laden consumer should consider making another big
purchase.</TE>

<HD>It's Not Easy to 'Fix' Nature</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Biologists taking the first steps toward restoring wetlands at Bolsa
Chica and in the Bay Area express a deep sense of humility about the
work ahead.</LD>
<LD>   They don't know whether their plans will work fully. They know
that success could be so far off in the future, they might not live
to see it.</LD>
<LD>   A federal restoration manager put it best, in words that should
ring into the future whenever people monkey with the environment:
"It's so hard for man to create nature."</LD>
<TE>   Decades ago, humans had little idea how much damage they were
doing when they "improved" what they viewed as swamps.</TE>
<TE>   Duck hunters cut off Bolsa Chica from the sea, creating ponds to
make their hobby easier. Subsequent oil drilling polluted the soil.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when the public had a better idea of wetlands' value,
developers offered "mitigation" in exchange for building rights along
marshes. Their plan: to make it up to the environment by building
artificial wetlands elsewhere. But the experiments often ended in
failures that became obvious only after the damage was done.</TE>
<TE>   Now we realize that wetlands are more than natural treasure
troves, home to migrating birds and other wildlife. They also filter
urban runoff and renew commercial fisheries. And now that we have
ruined most of the state's coastal wetlands, we discover that nature,
in all its complications, is very hard to fix.</TE>
<TE>   Walk inland from the wetlands and it's evident that the nature of
humans is to monkey with nature -- and to continue to make mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Toll road agencies built tunnels under their speedways for the
wildlife, then found that many animals didn't get the message:
"Wildlife Crosswalk This Way." The animals continued to walk where
they'd always walked and were hit by cars.</TE>
<TE>   We cannot help messing with nature. Ardent environmentalists wear
clothes, live in buildings, use energy, eat food. Organic food is
raised on land that once was wild. And though our knowledge of and
respect for nature grows, even the best efforts to minimize our
impact may have consequences we cannot foresee.</TE>
<TE>   Development plans are moving forward for Saddleback Meadows, known
to be an important wildlife corridor, and for Rancho Mission Viejo,
one of the last giant swaths of undeveloped land in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Governments and agencies have other long-term decisions ahead
about balancing the needs of people and the needs of nature.</TE>
<TE>   Humility--acknowledging how little we know--provides an important
source of wisdom in these matters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so hard for man to create nature."</TE>

<LD>In a couple of days, once again we will have the opportunity to
celebrate the historical triumph of liberty over tyranny by casting
our votes for this or that candidate or in support or opposition to
certain policies. If you are reading this letter, chances are that
you are among one of those "most likely voters." However, I would
like to respectfully ask you to consider, this election day, to find
a friend or a relative who is not planning to vote, and talk them
into participating in the election process. Even better, take them
along with you to the polling place and maybe a drink after. If they
ask why you care and why they should participate, you may consider
telling them any of the following:</LD>
<LD>   Tell them that their vote is the ultimate respect to the memories
of all those who died in two world wars, in Korea and in Vietnam,
fighting nazism and communism.</LD>
<LD>   Tell them that their walk into the voting booth is rekindling the
crushed spirits of those who marched into the Tiananmen Square.</LD>
<TE>   Tell them that that little funny thing they do with their eyebrows
when deciding whom to vote for will bring a smile, albeit short and
pale, to the faces of the political prisoners with broken jaws in
Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Tell them that the sound of opening the curtains at the voting
booths will be the most heavenly music to the tired ears of Saudi
women under veils.</TE>
<TE>   Tell them that the drink that you will share together after will
be the celebration of human spirit and individual freedom and will be
the strongest blow to those ignorant and intolerant souls who planned
and celebrated the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Tell them that if they have kids, their vote will be the single
most valuable lesson that they may have ever given to their children.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re: "Developers Back Prop. 51 With Eye on Irvine," Oct. 26:</LD>
<LD>   Remember how the Irvine Great Park was to be built without any
cost to the taxpayer? Well, think again.</LD>
<LD>   What Irvine's Mayor Larry Agran and his developer friends failed
to tell us is that they have slipped into Proposition 51, a
$1-billion-a-year measure, $110 million to help pay for the Great
Park at El Toro and additional funding for an airport terminal
without the planes. They want to be able to check in and ride to the
airport of their choice. At our expense, of course.</LD>
<TE>   After writing many glowing articles that were obviously pro-Great
Park and anti-El Toro airport, Times writer Jean O. Pasco seems to
have finally seen the light. I sincerely hope that the good citizens
of California will vote no on 51.</TE>
<TE>   George Wentworth</TE>
<TE>   Corona del Mar</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 51, the Traffic Congestion Relief and Safe School Bus
Act, appropriates state general funds for a number of specific
projects, only 24% of which are focused on traffic congestion or safe
school buses. The act also contains $120 million for the Great Park
(traffic congestion relief?), making the representation by Agran that
the park will be developed "at no cost to Orange County taxpayers" a
blatant lie.</TE>
<TE>   The act would fund many projects, including a railroad museum, a
rail line to an Indian casino, and improved water transportation on
Lake Tahoe. The act is not really about roads and school buses -- it
is about allocating funds to pet projects of the act's supporters.
Though the act does not directly increase taxes, where do you think
the state will get the funds needed for higher-priority issues such
as education and health care if this measure becomes law and diverts
money from the general fund? You guessed it, higher taxes or cuts in
other services.</TE>
<TE>   If passed, Proposition 51 will no doubt be the subject of a legal
challenge and probably will be shown to be the most corrupt use of
the initiative process in the history of California elections.
Agran's slate partners, Beth Krom and Mitch Goldstone, can, perhaps,
claim to have been duped by Agran, but the mayor, as a board member
of the group that sponsored Proposition 51, cannot claim ignorance.</TE>
<TE>   Don't be deceived by the mayor or by Proposition 51.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>My husband and I have begun repairs on our house. We have wanted to
do them for years but have held off because we didn't have the funds.
We had to prioritize our spending and budget our money until we could
afford it. This is not a new concept. It's one our parents used. But
it seems to be foreign to many here in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Take our school districts, for instance. One local school district
recently cut several elementary classroom programs and threatened to
increase the 20-to-1 classroom ratio because it didn't have the
budget for such essentials. At the same time, however, it began
building two new and expensive aquatic complexes. More and more
school districts are paying for the goodies first, knowing that
taxpayers will always spend money for their children's basic
education when push comes to shove later.</LD>
<LD>   That's probably one of the reasons we are faced with more than $10
billion in bond measures this election. With only a 55% majority
needed (thanks to Proposition 39), many of these bonds will now pass.
And all of us will pay the bill. Before you vote on these bond
issues, I urge you to check out district spending records. Look at
their budgets and see where they've chosen to put their funds. You
may be surprised. Like all of us, local governments need to
prioritize spending of their limited funds instead of always looking
for someone else to pick up the tab.</LD>
<TE>   Kimberly Keilbach</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There is no question, no denial, no hesitancy: Orange County
school buildings need repair and maintenance desperately. More than a
third of our K-12 schools are already in line for Proposition 47
funds, money earmarked to complete projects affecting the health and
safety of our children. There is no reasonable, legitimate excuse for
not approving Proposition 47 on Nov. 5. We owe our children clean and
safe places to learn and, at this moment, about 200,000 of them are
being denied that right.</TE>
<TE>   As your elected county superintendent of schools, it is my
responsibility to keep you informed on the status of public education
in Orange County. Recent test scores show that our children are
performing among the best in California and across the nation. Our
instructional program is world-class, but many of our school
buildings need restoration. We cannot expect our children to profit
from a first-class education in third-class buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 47 is not only good, responsible stewardship, but it's
good business too. As voters in a donor county, we know all too well
that we have many more opportunities to give than to receive. With
our help, Proposition 47 can return to Orange County school districts
and higher education campuses $600 million, creating jobs and good
will, clean classrooms and safer environment for all of us.</TE>
<TE>   Children are counting on us to do what's right. Vote yes on
Proposition 47.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Education Standards Threatened," Sept. 25:</TE>
<TE>   Public educators have demanded, and received, ever more money for
decades, always promising us that more money would somehow improve
things. It never does. There is no correlation between spending and
educational achievement. Yet the powerful unions in control of our
children's educational future continue to lie to our faces and fail
to teach our children even the basics.</TE>
<TE>   Nobel laureate and teacher Milton Friedman campaigns tirelessly
for educational reform, especially vouchers. Said Friedman, "Public
education is a socialist monopoly." It is time to overhaul education.
It is time to eliminate tenure, moderate the profound imbalance in
teachers' salaries (the highest paid teachers earn three times as
much as starters), eliminate the extreme leftist bias in education
and give parents real choice by way of vouchers.</TE>

<LD>   Absent a substantial intervention, AIDS will kill as many as 75
million people over the next two decades. Countless children will be
orphaned in the process. These are the conditions that destabilize

<LD>Re "Play in the World Series and They Will Come," Oct. 17:</LD>
<LD>   Since as far back as I can remember, my dad would take my sisters
and myself to the games. We have no brothers. I now take my son. The
last few years I had purchased "mini plans" for my son and me. I
can't afford season tickets; I'm a single mom doing it all alone.
This year I could not even afford the "mini plan," but we still
managed to go to a few games.</LD>
<LD>   My sisters and I stood in line approximately 16 hours to try to
buy World Series tickets, mostly to take Dad. We didn't get any. They
sold out before our numbers were called.</LD>
<TE>   Now you have all these Hollywood stars all of a sudden wanting to
be Angel fans and be seen at the games. This makes me sick! And since
they have the money to buy $1,000 seats, they get to go. They are now

<TE>   I was deeply touched by this story. It made me think of "The
Wonder Years" and the movie "The Sandlot." I don't follow baseball
that much, but it amazes me that the Angels have finally gotten this
far. Thank you for such a moving article.</TE>

<TE>   I wanted to thank staff writer Joe Mathews for sharing his story
and for the nostalgia he stirred in me.</TE>
<TE>   I vividly remember the steel beams rising above the orange groves
as the "Big A" was being built and the tour I took of the new stadium
in 1966. I still have the Kodak Instamatic pictures from camera day.
I too went to the games with my grandpa. He always wore a white straw
hat when we went to the games. He once asked if I would like to see a
picture of Mickey Mantle that he had in his wallet. When he showed
me, it was a picture of me in my East Orange AA Little League "Red
Legs" uniform.</TE>
<TE>   As I stood in Edison Field with my own son after the Angels won
the game that put them in the World Series for the first time, the
emotion of overcoming all the losses and actually having to deal with
winning was uncharted territory for me.</TE>
<TE>   What makes it even more special is how the players and coaches
have conducted themselves in achieving this feat. They did it with
heart, class, hard work, and appreciation of all those who have come
before them. That included the longtime fans. Thank you Angels!</TE>

<TE>   Re "As Angels Diversify, So Does Fan Base," Oct. 22:</TE>
<TE>   I, unlike the current "Red Wave" of bandwagon Angel fans, will not
sell out to that organization despite recent team success and efforts
to reach out to the Latino community. Why has it taken the
organization 20-plus years to realize the many benefits Latino fans
have to offer, not to mention the rich talent awaiting in countries
such as the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico?</TE>
<TE>   Interesting that it took potential buyer and Mexican billionaire
Carlos Peralta just one day to make this observation.</TE>

<TE>   I just finished watching the Anaheim Angels win the World Series!
What a great Series it was! Two wild-card teams managed by two
ex-Dodger players from California. Truly amazing! Congratulations to
both teams for an outstanding series!</TE>
<TE>   But then, at the end of Game 7, Fox television did a summary
highlighting each game and the city that each game was played in.
Newsflash: The Angels are from Anaheim, which is in Orange County.
The Angels are not from Los Angeles! There were scenes from the Santa
Monica Pier, the Hollywood sign and Sunset Boulevard, none of them in
the county. What about Disneyland, Huntington Beach, Knott's Berry
Farm? Crystal Cove? Orange Circle? I'm very proud of the Angels and
what they have accomplished this year. I am proud that I live in
Orange County. Fox television, get with the program!</TE>

<LD>   It is a crying shame that federal agencies won't stand up and
admit their mistakes so they can be avoided in the future. By
diverting too much water to farmers, the Fish and Wildlife Service
killed 20,000 salmon. Admit it and take steps to make sure it doesn't
happen again.</LD>
<LD>   Fishermen, environmentalists, California wildlife officials and
Native American tribes in the area all saw what happened, yet the
administration is scrambling to deny any culpability.</LD>
<TE>   It seems to me that these denials occur no matter which party is
in office, and all it does is make us more suspicious about our
government.</TE>

<HD>Differing Ideas for El Morro Beach Site</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "El Morro Should Go Public," Oct. 20:</LD>
<LD>   The Times characterizes the El Morro Village petition challenging
the certification of the environmental impact report as self-serving
and without merit. On the contrary, existing state law requires --
and the public deserves -- a comprehensive plan for Crystal Cove
State Park. This is precisely what our petition seeks: a
comprehensive plan. Thus far, the state Parks Department has
irresponsibly moved forward with piecemeal environmental planning.</LD>
<LD>   You will recall that not long ago, the department had a plan for
the Crystal Cove cottages. The department wanted a high-end resort
that the public soundly rejected. Now it is working on a new plan --
one that appropriately emphasizes preservation and public access.</LD>
<TE>   El Morro's petition challenges this second attempt at planning
Crystal Cove State Park. The area in question, where approximately
300 families reside, represents about 1% of the total park area. As
stipulated in the California Environmental Quality Act, piecemeal
planning is illegal.</TE>
<TE>   El Morro Village can, and will, raise fire safety, public safety
and affordable housing as issues to consider in the future; but for
now, our focus is to force the state to comply with existing state
law. Where is the comprehensive plan for Crystal Cove State Park?
That is the question raised in El Morro Village's petition.</TE>
<TE>   It is unfortunate The Times either failed to understand this
fundamental issue or, worse, discounted its legal significance when
it wrote its remarkably flawed and biased editorial.</TE>

<TE>   My family and I have been camping most of our lives, with the last
20 years enjoyed primarily up and down the Pacific Coast. We've
observed fellow campers to be courteous, responsible and appreciative
of the natural resources of parks and campgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Public campgrounds along the California Coast are few and far
between. All have attributes; some have memorable drawbacks. A noisy
railroad, for example, runs along bluff-top campsites near Carlsbad.
Oil can spoil Santa Barbara camping. And the campgrounds in Rockport
-- well, they're "at the end of nowhere!" As lovely as they all are,
none compares to the beauty of El Morro at Crystal Cove State Park --
an area that has long been the "private playground" of trailer park
renters. No wonder these residents have been reluctant to give up the
location and have recently filed a lawsuit against the state to
attempt to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Majestic ocean views, gorgeous sunsets, marine wildlife viewing,
coastal hiking and birding trails, and wonderful swimming beaches
grace the El Morro Canyon area. Unfortunately, the general public and
overnight campers have been largely excluded from enjoying these
attributes. As a former 16-year Laguna Beach resident, I hope
California will change that, and soon.</TE>

<LD>Re "Father Pleads Not Guilty in Girl's Shooting," Oct. 18:</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors are doing exactly what should be done by holding
Jeffrey A. West criminally responsible. He willfully bought the gun,
loaded the gun and walked into a room where his daughter was.</LD>
<LD>   Whether it be gross negligence or lack of a brain, West injured
his daughter and needs to suffer the consequences. "Model parents,"
as his attorney described them, don't act so recklessly when they're
around innocent children.</LD>
<TE>   Why didn't he go into a different room? Why didn't he wait to
inspect the gun until she went to bed? All are questions this devoted
and responsible parent wants answered. I'm sure he's devastated and
mortified. We all are! This was a crime, with precious Madison paying
the biggest price.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Deputy D.A. Resigns Over Arco Gas Case," Oct. 26:</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas is out of control and out of touch with his sworn
duties. A grand jury investigation has found fault with his
administrative practices. His favoritism of big business and
political contributors is a matter of public record.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas has now excluded one of his top prosecutors from
handling a landmark case in MTBE pollution. Instead, he has hired a
private law firm that contributed more than $3,000 to his coffers.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than go along with this, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michelle Lyman
has resigned. Does the Atlantic Richfield Co. have Rackauckas in its
pocket, and did Lyman leave because she knew the fix was in for a
sweetheart deal with a big oil company? The taxpayers of Orange
County need to know how much money is being given to this law firm to
cut a secret deal with Arco. We also need to know which judge is
overseeing this case.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas is known for fixing deals for his friends who are
willing to grease his political coffers.</TE>
<TE>   He is also being held to task by the county for an accounting of
money spent for food and alcohol from a fund earmarked for
investigations and witness protection. More than $4,000 of tax money
has gone to wine and dine political cronies of Rackauckas.</TE>

<HD>Roy Hertz, 93; Cancer Researcher's Work Led to Birth
Control Pill</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roy Hertz, 93, who discovered an early drug cure for a cancerous
tumor and whose work laid the groundwork for the development of the
birth control pill, died Monday at his home in Hollywood, Md.</LD>
<LD>   Hertz was chief of endocrine cancer research at the National
Cancer Institute in 1956 when he and a colleague, Dr. Min Chiu Li,
reported a cure for choriocarcinoma, a rare cancer of the placenta
that often occurs early in pregnancy and can be fatal within six
months.</LD>
<LD>   They found that the tumor could be eradicated by the sequential
use of two drugs, methotrexate and actinomycin-D. Cures were reported
in as many as 90% of women with choriocarcinoma who received the drug
therapy, which proved to be the most successful single-agent
chemotherapy for metastatic disease.</LD>
<TE>   Hertz's work in endocrinology paved the way for many leading
studies in the field. In particular, his research on progesterone
analogs formed the basis for development of the contraceptive pill.</TE>
<TE>   A Cleveland native, Hertz earned his medical degree and a PhD in
physiology from the University of Wisconsin and a master's degree in
public health from Johns Hopkins University. He won some of
medicine's highest honors, including the Albert Lasker Award for
Clinical Research in 1972. He also was nominated for a Nobel Prize.</TE>

<HD>Christopher Shelton, 76; Skipper of Ill-Fated Sailing Ship
Albatross</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Christopher B. Shelton, 76, skipper of the ill-fated sailing ship
Albatross when it sank in a sudden storm in 1961, died Oct. 5 of
pancreatic cancer in Stamford, Conn.</LD>
<LD>   Shelton used the 92-foot Albatross as a floating classroom. He was
traveling with his wife, Alice, and a group of high school students
when the ship was hit by a squall about 180 miles east of Key West,
Fla. His wife, four students and the ship's cook were lost in the
storm.</LD>
<LD>   Shelton, 11 students and another teacher made it to lifeboats, and
were rescued a day later. The disaster was the subject of the 1996
film "White Squall," with Jeff Bridges portraying Shelton.</LD>
<TE>   Born in New York City, Shelton graduated from the University of
San Marcos in Lima, Peru. He also earned a divinity degree from
Princeton Theological Seminary and a doctorate in philosophy from the
University of Madrid. After the Albatross incident, Shelton worked in
the Peace Corps for several years.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1960s, he bought another ship to use as a floating
classroom. But during its second voyage, the vessel caught fire off
the coast of Africa. All aboard escaped, but the ship was destroyed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>John Robert Russell, 85, the 13th Duke of Bedford who turned his
ancient Woburn Abbey north of London into a tourist attraction, died
Oct. 25 in Santa Fe, N.M.</LD>
<LD>   Woburn and its 16,000-acre estate had belonged to the Russell
family since King Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries in the 16th
century. But by the time the duke inherited it in 1953, it was nearly
derelict and faced heavy taxes.</LD>
<LD>   To the horror of some aristocrats, Russell installed a fun fair,
safari park and souvenir shop, and offered dinner with the family to
paying guests. The move helped the family retain the property, which
draws 1 million visitors a year.</LD>
<TE>   Russell was tutored at home as a boy and, after he married a
commoner, was briefly disinherited by his grandfather. He served
briefly in the Coldstream Guards during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   After his discharge, he worked as a reporter for the Sunday
Express newspaper. Russell and his wife did much of the work to clean
up the abbey themselves.</TE>

<HD>Getting a Head Start on Rancho Mission Viejo Plans</HD>
<DH>The task of balancing competing objectives and criteria is
difficult, but ultimately it is necessary to produce a reasonable and
fair plan that preserves the Ranch's natural treasures.</DH>

<LD>We in Orange County have a unique opportunity to act with foresight
as we plan how to deal with 23,000 acres of natural land owned by
Rancho Mission Viejo adjacent to San Juan Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   I don't want us to miss this important chance to work with the
landowner to preserve the quality of life we would all be proud to
pass on to future generations.</LD>
<LD>   Late last year, I created the South County Outreach and Review
Effort (SCORE), an approach to land-use planning for the Rancho
Mission Viejo property. I sought a collaborative way to bring
community dialogue to the planning process.</LD>
<TE>   SCORE was designed to bring early comment and community
participation together with the landowner before beginning the formal
county planning process. Previously, public involvement was deferred
until well into the planning process and coordinated with the release
of the draft environmental impact report.</TE>
<TE>   Through SCORE, we already have had public input from a diverse
group from throughout the community. This dialogue will continue
during the drafting of the EIR.</TE>
<TE>   I created SCORE to help me achieve two important objectives:</TE>
<TE>   First, I wanted to capitalize on the Ranch's interest in
comprehensively planning for this land, including the creation of a
nature reserve. To do this, we are using two planning tools designed
by the agencies whose task is protecting the environment. These tools
include the Natural Community Conservation Plan, which is associated
with upland areas, and the Special Area Management Plan (SAMP), which
is designed to protect wetlands and riparian species. SCORE is
intended to help define what occurs within the development areas
designated by the NCCP/SAMP.</TE>
<TE>   Second, I have sought to ensure early comment by the community on
issues relating to Ranch development before formal planning begins --
not at the end -- and to set the tone for balancing critical
components of future planning.</TE>
<TE>   The task of balancing competing objectives and criteria is
difficult, but ultimately it is necessary to produce a reasonable and
fair plan that preserves the Ranch's natural treasures. We want a
plan that acknowledges the property owners' stewardship of the land
for so many generations, recognizes their property rights and assures
the continued ranching lifestyle they have cherished.</TE>
<TE>   We also want a plan that addresses such issues as traffic, public
safety and local services. And it must balance the need for new
housing with the need for clean air, clean water and beaches, open
spaces and parks.</TE>
<TE>   We have successfully completed the first phase of SCORE.</TE>
<TE>   The SCORE task force, comprising dedicated community, government
and environmental leaders and the landowner, has worked together to
achieve important initial results. It has reached considerable
agreement on performance objectives for 14 key planning criteria
developed by my office. These range from traffic to housing and
habitat to public safety.</TE>
<TE>   Using these criteria as a solid foundation, the SCORE group has
reviewed several concept alternatives that blend nature reserve and
development designs provided by the resource agencies. Those agencies
include the California Department of Fish and Game, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and the Army Corps of Engineers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the SCORE Urban Runoff Task Force, which included
experts on water quality issues, provided a comprehensive tool kit
that will allow us to implement state-of-the-art water quality
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Collectively, these exemplary folks have devoted hundreds of hours
to the SCORE process, have had significant dialogue and shared many
innovative ideas.</TE>
<TE>   They have not always agreed -- but they all have provided
important and meaningful input.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the state and federal resource agencies will refine
NCCP/SAMP reserve designs to create the land-use areas, or "bubbles,"
that SCORE needs for its next phase.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these processes will have its own environmental review --
and all three environmental documents will be on the same track. Good
science must be the keystone of a viable reserve -- a fact recognized
by these agencies and the Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Phase II of our SCORE process will take place early in 2003, once
we have input from the state and federal resource agencies. At that
time, the SCORE group will reconvene and continue its joint process
along the same lines as Phase I.</TE>
<TE>   The future of the historic Rancho Mission Viejo is in the hands of
a family that has nurtured the land for generations, as well as those
of us who are committed to Orange County's unique quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   We need to work together toward a vision that will make us all
proud to call South Orange County home -- now and in the future.</TE>

<LD>There was a gunfight very close to my home in Laguna Beach on Oct.
23. I was only a block from the action, and I was trying to find the
source of the staccato-like bursts.</LD>
<LD>   I wasn't in combat when I served as a Marine in the 1960s, but my
training forced me to gravitate toward the action. That is what the
military teaches you. And after growing up on the mean streets of
Wilmington and Harbor City, I wasn't a stranger to the violence of
gangs and their guns. Coincidentally, I had just picked up my old BMW
from the lot where the suspect was lying when I finally figured out
what had happened.</LD>
<LD>   My local Police Department was outstanding in its response and
demeanor. But my curious and shocked fellow citizens gawked -- and
uttered the infamous "How could this happen here?"</LD>
<TE>   Frank Zappa once wrote, "Everybody's safe and it can't happen
here." These Laguna residents were missing the point. It can and did
happen here, just as "it" is happening all over the United States and
the world.</TE>
<TE>   As if death's honesty can be held at bay forever. As if we aren't
a country in love with and awash in guns, guns and more guns. Even
our president waves missiles around, threatening innocent civilians
thousands of miles away. When is someone going to explain that the
mythology of the Wild West should be put to rest along with those
already dead from senseless violence?</TE>
<TE>   The National Rifle Assn. advertisement featuring Charlton Heston
issues a five-word challenge about prying his gun "from my cold, dead
hands." Well, in Laguna Beach, they did. But what about that poor
store clerk? Or try asking the unbelievably brave officer, the "thin
blue line" that protected law-abiding citizens from chaos and
anarchy.</TE>
<TE>   "Boys and their toys." Let's be honest: Men are the provocateurs
for an overwhelming majority of these wanton acts of violence. Maybe
Freud was right: We are downright fascinated with our phallic
symbols, literally dying to pull them out and use them.</TE>
<TE>   I had a whacko pull a 9-mm rifle on me about 10 years ago in
Laguna Beach. I tried to back him down with my framing hammer -- and
found out only much later that his rifle wasn't loaded. Three squad
cars and a motorcycle officer responded within three or four minutes
to a 911 call from a neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   The police officers didn't know what to expect, but there they
were: ready, willing, and able to defend a total stranger. My actions
that day with the framing hammer were, in retrospect, not very smart.
The Laguna Beach Police Department did its duty. But the rifleman
turned out to have had a long history of violence. He continues to be
a thorn in the Police Department's side to this day. A year later,
surprise! He tried to run me over with his car.</TE>
<TE>   Ask yourself: What are you doing today, as an individual or member
of a group, to ensure that police officers and their families can
lead long and happy lives? They put their lives up for grabs -- in
some neighborhoods on an hourly basis -- so don't they deserve
something more than a mere paycheck?</TE>
<TE>   Support handgun control measures by contacting your state and
federal legislators. Notify your police department if you see guns
being inappropriately stored or brandished, especially if it occurs
around children.</TE>
<TE>   Call the police if you know of individuals who are threatening
others with weapons. If only one officer's family is spared a
horrible nightmare, the call will be worth it.</TE>
<TE>   We owe these men and women more than money. You may, as I did, owe
them your life.</TE>

<HD>Quest for Beauty Leads Mexican Women to Ruin</HD>
<DH>Ex-stripper allegedly operated as a plastic surgeon.
Awaiting trial, she is being sued by 141 people who say she gave them
toxic injections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alicia Calderon</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>GUADALAJARA</DL>
<LD>The schoolteacher says she wanted smaller breasts and was overjoyed
when a highly recommended plastic surgeon told her that instead of
surgery, a few injections would slim her down.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 1 1/2 years later, Veronica Gonzalez, 32, has lost her job
and her friends -- and may have to spend the rest of her life using a
walker. Doctors plan to remove her breasts, gluteal muscles and
calves because of damage from industrial silicone allegedly injected
into her body.</LD>
<LD>   It is just one of dozens of cases involving a woman in Guadalajara
who prosecutors allege operated as a plastic surgeon with a fake
license. The woman, Miriam Yukie Gaona, has been dubbed the
"Beautykiller."</LD>
<TE>   "I bought a funeral package and made out my will," Gonzalez said
of her initial reaction to her health problems. "She didn't just
mutilate my body. She mutilated my soul."</TE>
<TE>   But after buying rat poison and locking herself in her apartment,
Gonzalez saw a report on television about Gaona and decided to fight
back. Now she heads an association of people who contend that Gaona
victimized them.</TE>
<TE>   Gaona, who has been jailed since August awaiting dozens of trials,
denies the rapidly mounting charges against her. Her lawyer, Jose
Julian Jordan, says she isn't giving interviews, and he describes the
cases against her as a political conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfair to call her 'Beautykiller,' " he added. "She hasn't
killed anyone, and none of these women was a beauty."</TE>
<TE>   So far, 141 people -- almost all women -- have filed lawsuits
against Gaona in one of the largest medical malpractice cases ever
brought in Mexico. Health officials estimate that Gaona treated
between 1,500 and 2,700 people, offering cut-rate prices in a country
obsessed with TV's idealized standards of beauty but most too poor to
afford surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Gaona, a former stripper, allegedly began working as a plastic
surgeon in 1998 and, through word of mouth, she soon became the rage
of Guadalajara, a metropolis of 4 million people 280 miles west of
Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Women traveled from as far away as California and Texas to see la
doctora, who, patients say, prominently displayed a supposed license
on her clinic wall. Former patients also show Gaona business cards
bearing a curvaceous silhouette and the title "plastic surgeon."</TE>
<TE>   From society women to poor homemakers, patients reportedly lined
up around the block at Gaona's three clinics. They say she injected
them with what they were told were citrus blends to burn fat or
bovine collagen to increase size.</TE>
<TE>   Gaona -- who used her exaggerated lips and sculpted body as an
example of her skill -- allegedly injected as many as 300 women a
day, charging as little as 50 pesos, about $5, to poor clients and as
much as $150 to rich ones for each injection.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Gaona apparently never used citrus or collagen
injections. Instead, they charge, she filled her syringes with a mix
of industrial silicone -- normally used for sealing car parts and
appliances -- soy oil and a gelatin-like substance.</TE>
<TE>   The mix apparently was highly toxic. Dozens of women report lumps
in their breasts, hardening of their muscles and blackening of their
skin. Many have had mastectomies. Others face amputations of their
legs. Some have attempted suicide, and many have been spurned by
their husbands, their employers and their friends.</TE>
<TE>   One woman filed suit in 2001. But after Gaona's practice became
the focus of news reports this year, 140 more filed suit.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 346 people -- as young as 14 and as old as 60 -- have been
treated at state hospitals to repair damage they say was caused by
Gaona. Victims say hundreds more have quietly had reconstructive
surgery in private clinics, too ashamed to come forward. They predict
that other cases will emerge in the coming years when people's
symptoms become more severe.</TE>
<TE>   "We get groups of 5, 10 women at a time coming in. It's a lot of
people," said the lead prosecutor, Salvador Lopez Jimenez. "In order
not to ignore other cases, we had to build a team to work exclusively
on this one."</TE>
<TE>   His office, which has nine people on the case full-time, charges
Gaona with causing injuries and impersonating a professional --
violations that carry such light sentences there isn't a mandatory
jail term. Federal prosecutors have also charged her with
administering illegal drugs for the psychotropic pills that she
allegedly prescribed for weight loss.</TE>
<TE>   Gaona's lawyer calls the case "a mass psychosis." Jordan has
alternately described the motivation for her prosecution as a
personal vendetta by a former colleague from a strip club or as a
move by someone -- he won't say who -- seeking political gain.</TE>
<TE>   "If I denounce the person who is behind this, tomorrow I won't be
here," Jordan said, raising his eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   He says Gaona denies ever injecting anything into anyone --
although he also says she could be lying about that -- and he
contends that she never claimed to be a doctor. Gaona simply
distributed homeopathic pills for weight loss, he says.</TE>
<TE>   The victims, he charges, were paid by someone -- again he won't
say who -- to come forward with invented claims.</TE>
<TE>   The victims say otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Blanca Flores, 43, says that because of Gaona, she has had to have
parts of her breasts removed and plans to have the rest removed soon
because lumps of silicone continue to appear. Her 25-year-old
daughter plans surgery to remove lumps in her buttocks, as does
Flores' 26-year-old sister, Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Flores says her husband has become increasingly distant as her
body weakened.</TE>
<TE>   "He's still with me, but I don't think we'll last very long," she
said, wiping away tears. "He comes home angry. He explodes over
anything."</TE>
<TE>   The homemaker has spent thousands of dollars on surgery, and says
her husband refuses to spend any more on medicine or doctors. Friends
gave her money for her pending mastectomy, but she can't afford
breast implants to replace the tissue.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, the schoolteacher, faces even more surgery.</TE>
<TE>   She says she went to Gaona for a breast reduction, but Gaona
persuaded her to augment her buttocks and calves, and began a series
of 15 sessions for 15,000 pesos, or $1,500. At each weekly visit,
Gonzalez says, Gaona emptied a 5 cc syringe, giving her small
injections all over her body.</TE>
<TE>   After the last session, Gonzalez says, she couldn't climb the four
flights to her apartment. She went to her mother's house and didn't
get out of bed for a month. She added that she had a raging fever
that left her delirious, and her legs and feet were so swollen she
couldn't wear shoes.</TE>
<TE>   She says that Gaona refused to take her calls and that when she
was well enough to visit the clinic, Gaona's secretary wouldn't let
her in.</TE>
<TE>   Gaona's lawyer claims that Gonzalez's problems stem from a
previous series of breast augmentation and reduction surgeries that
left her scarred. He shows photos of her breasts and buttocks, and
says her only problem was cellulitis.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case of the vanity of Mexican women who are afraid of
losing their husbands or who want to steal the husband of someone
else," Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez denies that she had any operations on her breasts before
going to Gaona.</TE>
<TE>   In December, she says, she began to notice lumps all over her
body. She says doctors refused to help her, saying that if she got
injections, then she was responsible for the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   As her depression deepened, Gonzalez lost her job as a teacher at
an elementary school, and her friends stopped taking her calls. The
director of the psychology department where she took night classes
told her to drop out because she didn't fit the university's image.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez says she bought rat poison, disconnected her telephone
and locked her door, planning to kill herself. But then she saw the
TV report about a Gaona patient and was spurred into seeking action.</TE>
<TE>   As head of the association of former patients, Gonzalez
coordinates legal cases, leads group therapy and hands out fliers in
towns around Guadalajara urging other victims to come forward.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so hard to speak out at first. It was letting the world
know that you felt dead inside," she said. "But we want to let people
know what happened to us and hope that it helps to prevent the same
thing from happening to others."</TE>

<HD>Queen Recalls: The Butler Didn't Do It</HD>
<DH>Monarch's belated recollection of a 5-year-old conversation
clears a former servant accused of stealing from Princess Diana's
estate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Wallace</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>LONDON -- It was a royal case of recovered memory.</LD>
<LD>   Queen Elizabeth II's late-in-the-game recollection Friday of an
old conversation cleared a former butler accused of stealing
possessions from the estate of Princess Diana, ending a trial that
had stirred the ghosts of past royal scandals and threatened even
greater tabloid mayhem ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Crown prosecutors abandoned their case against the late princess'
longtime butler, Paul Burrell, 44, after the queen confirmed that
Burrell had told her that he had taken some of Diana's papers for
"safekeeping" after her 1997 death.</LD>
<TE>   The crown's case had been based on the sinister premise that
Burrell had absconded from Diana's Kensington Palace home with 310
items -- from CDs to designer clothes to intimate letters -- without
telling anyone.</TE>
<TE>   It now turns out that he had informed not just someone, but
Diana's former mother-in-law: the queen in whose name the prosecution
was formally waged.</TE>
<TE>   The butler-turned-small-town-florist, whom Diana once famously
referred to as her "rock," wept in the courtroom of London's Old
Bailey when it became apparent that the prosecution's case had
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "The queen has come through for me," he said as he emerged into
the flash of cameras outside. Burrell's first job in royal service
was as a footman to the queen .</TE>
<TE>   But his acquittal, which will be rubber-stamped by the jury within
days, raised hard questions about why the charges ever reached court.</TE>
<TE>   And the widely held view of a dismal prosecution case -- plus the
prospect of even more embarrassing royal revelations -- has nurtured
suspicions about the timing of the queen's realization that she
possessed crucial information.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it's very rum, very odd indeed," said Sarah Bradford, a
respected biographer of British royalty, including the queen.</TE>
<TE>   The butler had worked for Diana in the turbulent last 10 years of
her life, and the possibility of a grotesque replay in court of some
of those darker moments led to a widespread assumption that the royal
family was eager to find any excuse to stop the trial.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been a disaster for them," said Nicky Haslam,
designer and leading British socialite.</TE>
<TE>   The Buckingham Palace version of events is that the queen had been
unaware of the trial's details because she was on a royal tour of
Canada when it began. Her memory wasn't jogged until a week ago when
she, her husband, Prince Philip, and her son, Prince Charles, were
being driven to London's St. Paul's Cathedral to attend a memorial
service for British victims of last month's bombing of two nightclubs
in Bali, Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of what the palace described as a "general
conversation," the queen mentioned that Burrell had told her back in
1997 that he was holding some of Diana's items for safekeeping.</TE>
<TE>   Charles, Diana's ex-husband, swiftly recognized the potential
legal importance of this, the palace said, and "immediate steps were
taken to draw this to the attention of the police."</TE>
<TE>   Yet several people came forward Friday to say they had long been
aware of the meeting between Burrell and the queen. Diana's close
friend, Rosa Monckton, recalled Burrell telling her at the time:
"I've just had a meeting with the Boss Lady," which is how he
referred to the queen in casual conversation.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting -- but none of its details -- also was mentioned in
Burrell's original 39-page statement given to police in August 2001.
And it was cited again in his defense statement, the detailed outline
of the defense's case that, by law, was given to the prosecution
before the trial began.</TE>
<TE>   Both police and prosecutors said they never sought an explanation
from Burrell or the queen about what had been said between them.</TE>
<TE>   Burrell's lawyers said their client hadn't told them until this
week that the queen was aware he was holding Diana's things. They
implied that his discretion was a measure of his loyalty to the royal
family, a cornerstone of his defense.</TE>
<TE>   Burrell has always contended that he was merely preserving the
items out of devotion to Diana and her memory.</TE>
<TE>   But the crown tried to show that Burrell was not as close to the
princess as he claimed. That was just one of what Burrell's lawyer
Andrew Shaw said were "numerous errors" on which the prosecution
based its case.</TE>
<TE>   Over 12 days of testimony, the court heard many examples of what
appeared to be sloppy and overzealous police work.</TE>
<TE>   Under oath, detectives admitted that they had secured support from
Prince Charles and his son Prince William for their prosecution by
telling them that Burrell had sold stolen "Dianabilia" to foreign
collectors. They also said they would produce photos in court showing
Burrell and some of the princess' former staff members at a party
dressed in some of her designer clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Neither suggestion was true, police acknowledged under
questioning. Worse, Det. Maxine de Brunner said she allowed Charles
and William to "remain under that misconception."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, defense lawyers were coaxing unsettling gossip -- of
dubious legal value -- from prosecution witnesses, including Diana's
mother and two sisters.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosures were messy: Diana and her mother had not spoken in
the four months before her death; her brother, Charles Spencer, had
refused to let her rent a house on the family estate because it would
disturb his family's life, and the princess had kept a signet ring
belonging to James Hewitt, with whom she had had an affair while
married to Prince Charles.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the defense rebuttal, which Burrell's lawyers
promised would be "long, detailed and extremely interesting," had not
even begun.</TE>
<TE>   That led many to believe that the fix was in.</TE>
<TE>   "But it shows the British establishment is alive and well," Haslam
said.</TE>

<DL>BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan</DL>
<LD>Ivan Pozdayev and his classmates at the International Space School in
this Russian military enclave ignite a model rocket made from
Coca-Cola bottles and grin as it soars high over the treetops.</LD>
<LD>   But Ivan, 12, frowns when asked if he wants to be a cosmonaut. A
rocket scientist, then? He shrugs. "Maybe."</LD>
<LD>   Even here in Baikonur -- a city created out of Kazakhstan's barren
steppe in the 1950s to be the secret heart of the Soviet space
program -- persuading young Russians to pursue a career in the
underfunded and struggling program is not easy.</LD>
<TE>   For Russia, it is a pressing one: Its space program is largely
peopled by experts hired at the beginning of the space age. Many are
now in their late 50s or early 60s and thinking about retirement, and
the country needs to ensure that a new generation is in place to take
over.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, there is very little interest among young people,"
said Igor Barmin, chief engineer of the Baikonur launch pad, where
the Soviet space program awed the world by sending the first
satellite, Sputnik, into orbit in 1957 and cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin
four years later.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration also anticipates a large number of retirements in the
next 10 years, but space experts said NASA has been more successful
at recruitment than the Russians. NASA's top managers are in their
late 40s or 50s.</TE>
<TE>   "The Russians are in trouble," said James Oberg, author of the
book "Star-Crossed Orbits: Inside the U.S. and Russian Space
Alliance." "It is probably too late to avoid a devastating loss....To
transfer corporate knowledge and know-how, you have to work
side-by-side for years."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem facing the Russians has been persuading young
people to forgo the higher salaries of a business career for the
space program, where a cosmonaut's salary is about $300 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the Russian space program today, it is basically a
lot of older people who are not paid very well, and the main thing
that they seem to be doing is providing vacation opportunities for
bored millionaires," said John Pike, a U.S.-based space expert,
referring to Russia's selling of trips to the International Space
Station.</TE>
<TE>   Russian space officials strongly disagree, but concede that the
shortage of funds makes it difficult to launch big attention-getting
projects, such as NASA's Mars Odyssey.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Russians have focused on international programs where
they don't have to pick up the entire bill, such as the International
Space Station. But those programs don't generate the kind of
patriotic fervor that projects like the former Mir space station did.</TE>
<TE>   But in a move that some experts described as hopeful, Russian
space officials proposed an ambitious international project in August
to send people to Mars around 2015. Details were vague, but experts
said that sort of high-profile project is what's needed to bring
glamour back to the space program and get the attention of young
Russians.</TE>
<TE>   During the Soviet era, that was easy. The space program churned
out hero after hero, prompting many children to dream about becoming
the next Gagarin or chief designer Sergei Korolev. Roads and cities
bore the names of these Soviet stars after their deaths, and
monuments were raised in their honor.</TE>
<TE>   The space workers, considered by many to be the embodiment of
Soviet success, were rewarded with generous benefits, such as access
to luxury goods and exotic vacations.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the space workers toiling away in Baikonur drive on
potholed roads, live in crumbling apartment buildings and make do
without hot water for weeks on end. They also suffer from the
isolation of working in what became a foreign country with the
breakup of the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitry Shatalov, headmaster of Baikonur's International Space
School, must contend with these realities when he talks about space
program careers with his students, mostly male and many with
relatives working at the cosmodrome.</TE>
<TE>   But he's so optimistic that students will be drawn to the space
industry that he frets about letting them get too close to the aging
but real Soviet rocket in the school's courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   "They might not know it yet, but they'd be just the ones to figure
out how to set it off," he said. "Russia will be in good hands."</TE>

<HD>Quake-Jolted Italy Town Evacuated</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Rachman</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN GIULIANO DI PUGLIA, Italy</DL>
<LD>Wails of grief gave way to howls of panic Friday when aftershocks
jolted this village as it recovered the last of 26 children --
including all the first-graders except one -- killed when an
earthquake destroyed their school.</LD>
<LD>   Two elderly women were killed in their homes and a teacher was
crushed with her students Thursday as they prepared to celebrate
Halloween. Officials said late Friday that the final death toll was
29.</LD>
<LD>   After Friday's temblors, authorities ordered San Giuliano di
Puglia's 1,900 residents to evacuate the town as accusations mounted
about shoddy construction in a quake-prone zone.</LD>
<TE>   Illegal construction is rampant in southern Italy, and prosecutors
Friday opened an investigation into the collapse of the school, one
of the few buildings in town that was destroyed by the 5.4-magnitude
temblor.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also questioned why authorities hadn't designated the
region, about 140 miles southeast of Rome, as a quake-prone area,
which would have required stricter, anti-earthquake building
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The shock of the loss turned San Giuliano Di Puglia silent Friday,
but for the cries of relatives. This remote, tightly knit community
is composed largely of farmers producing olive oil, and many felt as
if a chunk of the next generation had vanished.</TE>
<TE>   "In this moment more than in any other, you can't express your
sadness," said Matteo Campanelli, 69, who lost four grandchildren in
the rubble. "They were children. Let's hope the angels embrace them."</TE>
<TE>   He spoke at the entrance of a gymnasium outside the town center
that had been converted into a morgue, where families wailed
alongside open caskets.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the dead children had been covered. But a few could be
seen lying in caskets, alongside basketballs, toys, photos and soccer
jerseys that relatives chose to bury with them. Some children were
placed in large mahogany coffins because the town ran out of small
white caskets.</TE>
<TE>   One child was rescued Friday, more than 15 hours after the quake:
9-year-old Angelo, who was pulled out at 3:54 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Residents evacuated from their homes were spending the night in a
tent city erected on the village's sports fields. News reports said
3,000 people in the affected region remained homeless.</TE>
<TE>   The school itself was a 35-foot pile of stone and bent metal
littered with "Puss N' Boots" books, an "E.T." pencil case, backpacks
and a sneaker.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Friday, rescuers extracting the final corpses hurtled down
the heap of rubble when the aftershocks rumbled through town,
including one registering 5.3. But they returned to remove the final
body, that of a teacher credited with saving several students.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a hero. She pushed all her children out and then the
building collapsed on her," said Stefan De Mistura, a former U.N.
official and head of the Italian Red Cross. "She was shouting for the
children to go out."</TE>
<TE>   Another teacher who survived, Clementina Simone, said she was
giving her students a geography lesson about earthquakes near
erupting Mt. Etna in Sicily when the earth shook in San Giuliano di
Puglia.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told I had lost all of my nine first-grade pupils," Simone
said. "I wanted to go back and help, but the rescuers wouldn't let
me."</TE>
<TE>   One first-grader, 7-year-old Veronica, told reporters Friday from
the hospital that she survived by hiding under a desk.</TE>
<TE>   Pope John Paul II, appearing at his window overlooking St. Peter's
Square at the Vatican, offered prayers for the victims and
encouragement to survivors and rescue crews.</TE>
<TE>   With the last body removed, though, attention shifted to why the
50-year-old yellow complex, which housed a nursery, elementary and
middle school, collapsed while other buildings remained standing.</TE>
<TE>   The ANSA news agency reported that a second story had been added
to the original structure in recent years and that renovations were
carried out two years ago in which heavy cement was applied to the
structure to try to reinforce it.</TE>
<TE>   The last time authorities updated quake plans for the region, San
Giuliano di Puglia was not considered at risk for strong earthquakes,
engineer Enzo De Crescio said. The school, he said, did not meet
earthquake safety standards.</TE>

<HD>Witches Turn to Austria for a Spell</HD>
<DH>Students of three-year correspondence course learn about
anatomy, botany and astronomy plus horoscopes, magic, tarot cards and
dowsing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susanna Loof</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>KLAGENFURT, Austria</DL>
<LD>There's no abracadabra or broom-flying at Andreas Starchel's School
of Witchcraft.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, there's astronomy, botany, anatomy and other scientific
studies, along with classes in oracles, tarot cards, horoscopes,
dowsing and magic. Today's witchcraft, the teachers say, is just
mainstream science applied in a different way.</LD>
<LD>   "A witch is someone who looks holistically on life, who does
life-counseling things. A witch serves to help humans," said Sonja
Kulmitzer, 28, who runs the school with Starchel.</LD>
<TE>   Their witches-in-training are far removed from the spell-casters
of Harry Potter and Snow White, or the ghoulish decorations for sale
in shops around Halloween, now a popular holiday in Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Students learn to open their senses so that they can perceive
information that is filtered away by most people, said Andreas
Starchel, 35, who says he is a Druid. They also learn to connect
sciences in new ways, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays, everyone is so specialized," Starchel said. "Druids and
witches are basically highly educated people, but not just in one
topic."</TE>
<TE>   Starchel and Kulmitzer began offering organized courses in
witchcraft in 1998. Initially, their three-year course consisted of
monthly seminars for which students would travel to Klagenfurt, a
southern Austrian city about 220 miles southwest of Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the people interested live far away and few showed up
for the seminars, so the program was reorganized into a
correspondence course with seven modules.</TE>
<TE>   Those who pass a test at the end of each module and write a 25- to
30-page thesis are awarded a "Certificate of Venefica," a document
invented by Starchel and Kulmitzer. Venefica is Latin for witch.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope it will become the norm for witches," Kulmitzer said. "We
want to have a quality standard. There are so many people running
around saying they are witches just because they can brew chamomile
tea."</TE>
<TE>   Students pay $106 for a module, or $142 if they want online
coaching. Those who want to earn the certificate must pass a test at
the end of each module. Each exam costs $68.</TE>
<TE>   The dowsing module test, for example, includes a map of Carinthia,
the southern Austrian province that includes Klagenfurt, over which
students use pendulums to find energy lines. The pendulum works like
a divining rod used for dowsing for water when outdoors, said
Kulmitzer, who added that most students pass the tests.</TE>
<TE>   Only three students have graduated so far, and more than 100 are
studying modules.</TE>
<TE>   Karin Isamberth of Salzburg enrolled in 1999 and hopes to finish
by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing for me is to know that I have understood it,"
said Isamberth, who already considers herself a witch. "You can't
learn it all in a class. You have to continue working with it."</TE>
<TE>   Although Starchel says it's all based on science, he contends that
it takes talent to use witchcraft to help others.</TE>
<TE>   Magic rituals work for those who believe in them because they
spark selective perception and self-fulfilling prophecy, helping
ritual users achieve their goals, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Management classes use the same methods, though they would never
dare to use the word magic," Starchel added.</TE>
<TE>   Most students taking the course are in counseling professions, and
few expect to make a living as a witch. Even Starchel works as a
technician at Klagenfurt University, and Kulmitzer moonlights as a
jazz and soul singer.</TE>
<TE>   Still, to Isamberth, becoming a witch affects almost every aspect
of life.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a witch is something you are 24 hours a day," she said.
"It's an attitude toward life. You have to live according to this
life philosophy."</TE>

<HD>Immigrant's Letters Offer a Window to the Past</HD>
<DH>Correspondence from decades ago tells the story of a single
family from the Czech region, as well as the history of a troubled
continent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas J. Sheeran</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The letters tell a trans-Atlantic love story of a Czech woman facing
a new life in the United States and her family in the Old World.</LD>
<LD>   The package turned up at a house sale -- 110 letters written from
the Czech region between 1909 and 1947 to Anna Kohout, a Czech
immigrant and spinster who devoted her life in Cleveland to working
as a housekeeper, practicing her Roman Catholic faith and sending
money back to her family.</LD>
<LD>   A friend bought the package for Karen Donovan Godt, an artist who
uses old letters and documents to design postcards and collages.</LD>
<TE>   Godt planned to use Kohout's letters in her artwork.</TE>
<TE>   The effort turned into a labor of love for Godt, who became
fascinated by the story the letters told.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to find out about her," Godt said. "Part of it was
spiritual. Her story -- I felt I needed to know her."</TE>
<TE>   Godt enlisted the help of Winston C. Christlock, a professor of
central European history at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul,
Minn., to translate the letters.</TE>
<TE>   Through surviving friends, immigration records and tidbits
mentioned in the letters, Godt pieced together a portrait of Kohout
as a thrifty, prayerful, single-minded woman who once turned aside an
engagement offer from a man in Omaha in favor of cleaning house for a
wealthy Cleveland family.</TE>
<TE>   Godt, who thinks of Kohout as a kindred spirit, hopes to produce a
coffee-table book about the letters and the life of a simple
immigrant who was forever separated from a beloved family.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all part of the same community of life," Godt said.</TE>
<TE>   The letters tell the story of a single family but also the history
of a troubled continent.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Kocab, 70, of Cleveland, who is host of a weekend Czech
language radio show, said such letters can be important in
documenting the history of a nation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not scholarly writing. It's not political writing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's their own little history, which is the history of 99% of
us," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Kohout was born July 8, 1888, and grew up in the farming village
of Hory Matky Bozi, south of Pilsen and too small for some
contemporary maps of the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   She left her extended family and went to the United States at age
16, worked for a harsh boss in New York City and returned to her
homeland.</TE>
<TE>   After one year home, she changed her mind and returned to the
United States in 1905. She settled in Cleveland, a city then
expanding fast with immigrants attracted to jobs in steel mills and
factories.</TE>
<TE>   "She's always sending them money," said Christlock, who sometimes
struggled for five hours on a four-page letter with florid
handwriting, outdated syntax and phonetic spellings by the writers,
Kohout's four sisters and four brothers.</TE>
<TE>   The hardships come through in the letters, as the Czech region
struggles through World War I, disease, depression, Nazi
dismemberment of their homeland and then war again.</TE>
<TE>   "And now we have, thanks to God, a free republic, and we expect it
to be better," the family wrote in 1919 after the end of World War I.</TE>
<TE>   Czech freedom lasted two decades until Nazi Germany expanded,
eventually leading to World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "We brought the sacrifice to the altar of peace, and now we await
what others will give on that altar," brother Jindrich wrote Jan. 1,
1939, after Czechoslovakia handed a piece of itself to Germany in a
failed attempt to create a lasting peace.</TE>
<TE>   Peace did not survive the year.</TE>
<TE>   In America, Kohout was working, going to church and the opera, and
loyally sending money to her family as it struggled.</TE>
<TE>   Their return letters often included thanks "many times for the
quick and willing help" and provided a glimpse of life: family
events, the crop prospects, the weather, village gossip.</TE>
<TE>   They appealed to Kohout after World War I to try to travel home to
visit while their mother was still alive.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly we could give her great joy from those sorrows which
the old years brought to her more than to others," brother Josef
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   There are complaints about political infighting, which emerged as
Czechoslovakia became a free nation, sorrow for those killed in
combat and praise for "the glorious man President Wilson," who
championed Czech independence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unusual to get the documentation of everyday life from
everyman's perspective," said Carmen Langel, curator of the National
Czech &amp; Slovak Museum &amp; Library in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Hearing a
description of the letter collection, she said her museum has nothing
like it. Most artifact collections focus on significant events in
history, especially from a leadership point of view, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Homespun letters tell you "not just what's going on in society but
what's important to them. Obviously, weddings are important, or the
weather, or whatever," Langel said.</TE>
<TE>   Mila Hyvnar, a 75-year-old Czech immigrant and former Czech
language newspaper editor in Cleveland, said she missed having such
letters from her family after she fled her then-Communist-dominated
homeland in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   The Communist regime barred letters to relatives who had emigrated
illegally, according to Hyvnar, who sent relatives letters that were
smuggled by travelers.</TE>
<TE>   The letters to Kohout stopped in 1947, as the Communists
consolidated their control over Czechoslovakia after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "Life was very difficult for them," Hyvnar said.</TE>
<TE>   With the end of the letters, there's no clue about how much later
contact Kohout had with her family, although it likely declined as
her siblings died, Godt said.</TE>
<TE>   Kohout lived to age 97.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larry Dobkin, a television director and character actor whose acting
credits spanned stage, radio, TV and films over seven decades, has
died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Dobkin, one of five actors who played detective Ellery Queen on
radio, died of heart failure Oct. 28 at his home in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Dobkin appeared in more than 65 feature films, including "The Ten
Commandments," "Julius Caesar," "Sweet Smell of Success," "The
Defiant Ones," "North by Northwest," "Patton" and "Angels in the
Outfield."</LD>
<TE>   As an actor, he appeared in early TV shows such as "I Love Lucy,"
"The Adventures of Superman," "You Are There," "Playhouse 90" and
"The Colgate Comedy Hour." He also showed up frequently in TV
westerns in the 1950s and '60s, including "Gunsmoke," "Lawman," "The
Rifleman," "Have Gun Will Travel" and "Rawhide"--as well as series
ranging from "77 Sunset Strip" to "The Untouchables" and, more
recently, from "NYPD Blue" to "Judging Amy."</TE>
<TE>   As a television director, he gathered credits from the '50s
through the '80s, including "The Donna Reed Show," "Dr. Kildare,"
"The Waltons," "Barnaby Jones," "Charlie's Angels," "Dallas,"
"Dynasty" and "The Fall Guy."</TE>
<TE>   Dobkin, who received an Emmy nomination for his supporting role in
the 1967 "CBS Playhouse" production of "Do Not Go Gentle Into That
Good Night," also wrote the 1976 film "The Life and Times of Grizzly
Adams."</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City in 1919, Dobkin began acting off Broadway in
his mid-teens. He graduated from the Yale School of Drama and served
as Paul Lucas' understudy in the 1942 Broadway production of Lillian
Hellman's "Watch on the Rhine."</TE>
<TE>   On radio in the '40s and early '50s, he appeared in shows such as
"The Lux Radio Theatre" and "Philco Playhouse." Most notably, he
played the title role of the suave, deductive genius in "The
Adventures of Ellery Queen" from 1947 to 1948.</TE>
<TE>   Dobkin, whose family said "his passion was his work," never
retired as an actor.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 33 years, Anne; three daughters,
Deborah Janke of Colorado Springs, and Kristy and Kaela Dobkin, both
of Los Angeles; a son, Laird Fenwick of Toronto; and a grandson.</TE>

<HD>B.A. Lengyel, 92; Chaired Cal State Northridge Physics
Dept.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Stassel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bela A. Lengyel, the first chairman of the Cal State Northridge
physics and astronomy department and the author of the first
technical book about lasers, has died. He was 92.</LD>
<LD>   Lengyel died Thursday of congestive heart failure in an Irvine
skilled-nursing facility, said his son, Thomas E. Lengyel.</LD>
<LD>   In 1962, as several companies were developing newly discovered
laser technology, Lengyel wrote "Lasers." At the time, he was working
at Hughes Research Laboratory in Malibu, and he was authorized to
utilize information for the book that he had gathered for internal
company use.</LD>
<TE>   The 125-page book was translated into many languages--including a
bootleg Russian copy--and was expanded into a second edition in 1970.
The Soviet Union and other nations were interested, said CSUN physics
professor Barney Bales, because the laser had uses for both the
military and communications industries.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very, very useful book written clearly for someone who
wanted to get into that field and didn't know where to start," said
Kumar Patel, a UCLA professor of physics.</TE>
<TE>   Julio Blanco, a former student of Lengyel's and now chairman of
CSUN's physics and astronomy department, said Lengyel's book "was
talked about all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   Born Oct. 5, 1910, in Budapest, Hungary, Lengyel earned a doctoral
degree in mathematical physics in 1935 from his hometown Pazmany
University, now called Roland Eotvos University. The following year
he was an exchange fellow studying math at Harvard University.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Hungary for a few years and then immigrated to the
United States in 1939 to take a job as a math teacher at Rensselear
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. He later was a physicist at the
Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, he moved to Los Angeles to join the technical staff of
the Hughes Research Laboratory. Although he was not directly involved
in the discovery of lasers, he participated in some experiments while
collecting information on the ground-breaking technology.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to academia in 1963, joining the Cal State Northridge
faculty and establishing the physics and astronomy department.
Described by Blanco as having "very high standards and very strict
values," Lengyel taught all levels of physics. In the mid-1960s, he
wrote a comprehensive textbook, "Introduction to Lasers."</TE>
<TE>   Lengyel served as department chairman until 1970 and retired from
CSUN in 1977, the year he was the university's nominee for the
statewide outstanding professor award.</TE>
<TE>   Lengyel is survived by his wife of 39 years, Birgit of Irvine; his
son, Thomas of Cedarburg, Wis.; a daughter, Judith Lengyel of Pacific
Palisades; a stepson, Hans Westberg of Redondo Beach; a stepdaughter,
Karin Ahlf of Costa Mesa; a brother, Balazs Lengyel; a sister, Piri
Horvath of Hungary; two grandchildren; and four step-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for a memorial service are pending.</TE>

<HD>Bari Rolfe, 86; Expert on the Art of Mime</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bari Rolfe, a dancer, choreographer, teacher and author who became an
expert on the art of mime, has died. She was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Rolfe died Oct. 19 of unspecified causes in Berkeley, where she
had lived since 1976, according to her friend Spring Friedlander.</LD>
<LD>   Dubbed "the grandmother of American mime" by her devotees, Rolfe
wrote several books, including "Behind the Mask" and "Commedia
dell'Arte: A Scene Study Book," both in 1977; "Movement for Period
Plays" in 1985; and "History and Mystery of Mime" in 1990. She edited
other books, including Mime Directory Bibliography in 1978 and "Mimes
on Miming" in 1980.</LD>
<TE>   Although Rolfe had no college degree, she taught mime at several
institutions of higher education, including UCLA, Cal State
Northridge, the University of Washington and Chabot College in
Oakland, where she helped establish the Conservatory of Mime. She
also conducted workshops in Europe and Canada and at the
International Festival of Clowning at Cal State Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chicago to a chiropractor father and dress designer
mother, Rolfe grew up, in her words, "dancing around the house." She
studied ballet as a child and performed professionally at the Chicago
World's Fair, in nightclubs and in vaudeville.</TE>
<TE>   After moving to Los Angeles with her family during World War II,
Rolfe worked with the Pan American Dance Group, which helped teach
dance to children on the Eastside. Rolfe also performed at military
institutions in Southern California and was active in the Hollywood
Canteen.</TE>
<TE>   With the first of her three husbands, she moved to San Francisco
in the 1950s and there saw a performance of internationally known
mime Marcel Marceau that changed her life. By the early 1960s, she
was in Europe studying at the Etienne Decroux School for Mime and the
Jacques Lecoq School of Mime, Movement and Theater.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to study mime to be a better dancer," Rolfe once told the
writers' anthology Contemporary Authors. "But the school opened so
many doors to a deeper recognition of reality, to tremendous vistas
of imagination, that the experience demanded a shift from performer
to teacher. I simply had to proselytize. Then writing was the next
logical step."</TE>
<TE>   Information on survivors was not available.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial celebration is planned at 2:30 p.m. today at the North
Berkeley Senior Center in Berkeley.</TE>

<HD>India Lynchings Revive Bitter Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Lancaster</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL> DULENA, India</DL>
<LD>DULENA, India -- It began, by most accounts, with a grisly rumor:
Five men had been arrested after stealing a cow -- revered by Hindus
as the mother of all humanity -- and skinning it alive just steps
from the construction site of a Hindu temple. Something had to be
done.</LD>
<LD>   It was.</LD>
<LD>   Inflamed by a day of religious revelry, a mob several thousand
strong converged on the small police outpost where the men were being
held, dragged them from their cell and beat them to death with clubs
and bricks, according to government officials and local residents.
Two of the bodies were burned.</LD>
<TE>   Now the gruesome killings in this small farming community, less
than an hour's drive west of New Delhi, have revived an impassioned
national debate: Is the life of a cow more sacred than that of a man?</TE>
<TE>   The debate echoes a larger battle over the identity of this vast
and ethnically diverse nation of a billion people, pitting the
guardians of India's secular pluralistic traditions against ascendant
Hindu nationalists who see themselves as protectors of India's
dominant faith and culture.</TE>
<TE>   Although authorities have promised a full investigation of the
Oct. 15 lynchings, which occurred in the presence of several dozen
police officers and a local magistrate, so far the only charges in
the case have been lodged against the five dead men, for "cow
slaughter." Investigators have received the results of an autopsy --
on the cow.</TE>
<TE>   And for many members of India's powerful Hindu nationalist
movement, the killing of the five dalits -- or untouchables, who
occupy the lowest rung of the Hindu caste system -- was an
understandable, perhaps even justified, response to an even more
serious offense.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider the cow to be the mother of the world, of humanity,
so if you've murdered a cow, then you've murdered a mother," said
Pitambar Gaur, 35, who heads the local chapter of the World Hindu
Council, a prominent nationalist group.</TE>
<TE>   While expressing sympathy for the dead men, he described the
killings as "logical" under the circumstances, adding, "If this act
becomes a deterrent to prevent others from doing this, then I think
it was right."</TE>
<TE>   Such statements have infuriated secular liberals, who see the case
as the latest example of how Hindu extremists and their political
allies -- including the Bharatiya Janata Party, which leads India's
coalition government -- are undermining the rule of law and deepening
the fissures in Indian society. Politicians from the opposition
Congress Party, among others, have accused police of conspiring with
Hindu radicals in the state of Haryana to incite the lynchings, which
have received prominent coverage in the Indian news media.</TE>
<TE>   India has a long history of such bloodshed, typically involving
clashes between Hindus and members of the country's Muslim minority.</TE>
<TE>   In the state of Gujarat last spring, Hindu mobs killed more than
1,000 Muslims after a Muslim mob attacked a train carrying Hindu
activists, killing 60.</TE>
<TE>   But dalits too have suffered their share of persecution. Although
they are Hindus, their place at the bottom of the caste system
renders them "impure" in the eyes of many Indians, and therefore
suitable only for jobs that higher-caste Hindus shun.</TE>
<TE>   One of those jobs involves skinning cattle. Although slaughtering
cows is illegal in India, the government grants licenses to dalits
who collect and sell the hides of cows that die of disease, old age
or accidents. The lynching victims made their living this way,
relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the victims, Virender Singh, 23, lived with his wife, two
small children and their extended family in a two-story concrete home
in Badshahpur, a village just outside New Delhi.</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't find a single fault with my son," his 60-year-old
mother, Ramvati, recalled as she squatted in the family's
fly-infested courtyard, a pink shawl framing her deeply lined face.
"He worked with his hands and ate honestly. He didn't drink, he
didn't smoke, he didn't gamble."</TE>
<TE>   His father, Rattan Singh, said his son and four companions ran
into trouble when they were driving to a distant village with a load
of about 200 cowhides, which they planned to sell for up to $16 each.
He denied that they had stopped to retrieve a cow, or cow carcass,
and accused police of beating the five men to death after they
refused to pay a bribe, then concocting the lynching story to cover
their own crime.</TE>
<TE>   Other relatives of the victims told a slightly different version,
asserting that police beat one of the men to death. Then, they say,
police sought to hide the evidence of their crime by planting the
cow-killing rumor with Hindu extremists before turning over the other
men to the mob.</TE>
<TE>   That a lynching of some sort took place was confirmed by local
residents as well as Gaur, the Hindu council official, who said he
arrived on the scene around midnight to find five corpses in the road
and about 500 people milling nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The police investigation has made little headway, and police say
their task has been hampered by the darkness and confusion of the
moment. Villagers have been uncooperative; many sympathize with the
killers.</TE>
<TE>   "These are good Hindus and as good Hindus, it would be right that
they got angry and killed them," said Kuldip Singh, owner of a brick

<HD>When It Comes to Names, Missouri's the 'Tickle Me' State</HD>
<DH>Town monickers -- including Braggadocio and Brazil --
reflect the culture, education and prejudices of settlers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Charton</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>BRAGGADOCIO, Mo.</DL>
<LD>The town name begs the question: Are folks from Braggadocio
braggarts?</LD>
<LD>   "Naw, we're pretty humble down in these parts, and I know because
I've lived here all my life," said Caleb Davis, a 59-year-old farmer.
"It is a memorable name for a town, though."</LD>
<LD>   Missouri has some of the most memorable place names in the United
States, from Economy to Tightwad, Romance to Bachelor, Sunrise to
Sunset.</LD>
<TE>   "Much can be learned about men and places from their names,"
Robert L. Ramsay, the late University of Missouri professor, wrote
half a century ago in his book, "Our Storehouse of Missouri Place
Names."</TE>
<TE>   "Names are fossil history," Ramsay wrote, likening the search for
the story behind a place name to an archeological dig. "So the
student of language can find in the place names of the state equally
priceless relics that are sometimes quite as old, and often even more
revealing."</TE>
<TE>   Ramsay noted that Missourians could take a world tour without
leaving the state, just by reading exotic-sounding city limit signs:
Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, Belfast, Dublin, Elba, Versailles, Vichy,
Lisbon, Milan, Rome and Venice, to cover just part of the Show-Me
State's globe.</TE>
<TE>   There are tributes to natural and mineral wealth, communities
called Acid, Galena, Hematite and Crystal City.</TE>
<TE>   Some names were drawn from the classics: Alexandria, Athens,
Carthage, Hannibal, Ionia and Eolia.</TE>
<TE>   And some names are just silly: Arp, Ink, Ogg and Tea.</TE>
<TE>   The names behind those signs that rush past so quickly along the
highway shoulders reflect the culture, education, experiences and
prejudices of Missouri's settlers.</TE>
<TE>   Even the types of words applied to communities evolve over the
decades. For example, biblical names were as popular for places as
for babies in the 1800s. But nowadays, there is a tendency to name
new settlements -- or subdivisions -- in cozy-sounding tributes to
famous golf courses.</TE>
<TE>   "With the current naming practices, be it towns or subdivisions or
streets, Scottish, English, Irish and maybe French-sounding names are
in vogue. These tend to be unimaginative stock names, usually more
trendy than interesting," said Walter Schroeder, a retired geography
professor and chairman of a state commission that is responsible for
approving new place names for the sake of consistency.</TE>
<TE>   Braggadocio, an unincorporated community deep in southeast
Missouri's Bootheel, is a fine example of an imaginative name that
conjures an image of boastful inhabitants.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he was always told that the hamlet's settlers wanted to
pick the longest, most impressive name they could find when applying
to establish a post office.</TE>
<TE>   With 11 letters, they figured Braggadocio "would really impress
the folks up in Washington," he said with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsay had another take on Braggadocio:</TE>
<TE>   "All records of the exact circumstances of its naming seem to have
been lost, and many stories have been invented as for example about
the first settler's having been given to much boasting about the
beauty of his wife, who had the remarkable name of 'Docio' -- in
other words, bragging on Docio."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Post Office finally sent word to new settlements to keep
their names short. Thus a raft of three-letter names, from Odd to
Ink.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the spinning of contemporary explanations for ancient
names causes grief for writers and researchers. Schroeder recalled an
article he wrote mentioning a Texas County settlement with a one-room
schoolhouse known locally as Three John School.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone told me that was because its outhouse had three holes in
it, which would have been unusual," Schroeder said. "But then I
received a very sincere but indignant letter from a lady there who
said it was named for the board that ran the school, three men all
named John. Yes, it's a more accurate story. Just not quite so
funny."</TE>
<TE>   Peculiar, Mo., near Kansas City, has one of the most-giggled-about
names for any town. Schroeder said the founders were asked to provide
a name peculiar to the region that wouldn't duplicate another name.</TE>
<TE>   "They had their first selection rejected, so they came back with
Peculiar," Schroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   In all his travels, Schroeder is most amused about an area in far
northern Missouri known for its waterway: No Creek.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, there is a creek there, and a bridge runs over it. I
have asked the locals, is there no creek at No Creek? They really
don't think it's funny at all. They say they don't know and don't
care. But there's obviously some history behind it, so somebody
cared."</TE>

<HD>Maybe Dying Has a Nice Ring to It</HD>
<DH>Firm says it can make diamonds by extracting carbon from
cremains. The result is a bluish gem, which heirs can fashion into
jewelry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Kates</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>NORTH SYRACUSE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Fred Fergerson already offers his customers options. They can have
their ashes blasted into orbit, sprinkled on the slopes of the Swiss
Alps or used in patching coral reefs in the Pacific Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   Now he proposes spending eternity as a diamond.</LD>
<LD>   By extracting the carbon from cremated human bodies, a
Chicago-based company is giving the dearly departed a chance to
sparkle forever as a synthetically produced diamond.</LD>
<TE>   "It sounds a little weird at first -- a little off-base -- but we
also put remains in orbit. Nobody has ever asked for that either, but
we have it as an option," said Fergerson, a funeral home owner in
upstate New York who was among the first in the country to offer
LifeGem diamonds.</TE>
<TE>   No clients have signed up yet at Fergerson's. But in the first
month, he said, about 30 people made serious inquiries.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it as just another service. People usually ask what can we
do with the cremains afterward. Anything you want, including make a
diamond out of them. I'll tell you, that starts a conversation," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Gage, 35, who runs a restaurant, sports bar and health salon
in Rockford, Ill., rather likes the idea. She and her husband
recently put down a deposit on a pre-need contract with LifeGem. Gage
is thinking about having her cremains pressed into a 1/2-carat
diamond that can be set in a family ring.</TE>
<TE>   "It's natural to want to keep something of a loved one, and many
people do," she said. "But it's not complete. It's not really them;
it's only a possession. This is complete. This will really be a piece
of me.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that will keep forever and can be passed on as
an heirloom."</TE>
<TE>   LifeGem, which is still awaiting approval of its patent
application, introduced the unprecedented service in late August, and
the response has been dramatic. The company's Web site is registering
45,000 hits a week, said Greg Herro, one of four co-founders.
Initially, six funeral homes nationwide -- including Fergerson's --
offered LifeGem's service. By mid-October, that number had climbed to
more than 50.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there will be a million jokes about it, but if it provides
comfort and connection for the bereaved, it's a good idea," Herro
said. "Remembering the life of a person, instead of their death, is
what it's all about."</TE>
<TE>   The idea was born in 1999 when Herro, his brother Mike, and their
friends, Rusty and Dean VandenBiesen, were discussing mortality. The
talk turned to funerals.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone thought being able to somehow stay close to your lost
loved one was important," Herro said.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty VandenBiesen suggested diamonds. The body is made of carbon.
Diamonds are made of carbon. So why not make diamonds from people, he
wondered. The partners began investigating the possibilities,
undeterred by the many friends and relatives who said the idea was
just too bizarre.</TE>
<TE>   The process of making synthetic diamonds was pioneered by General
Electric Co. in the early 1950s, and has been refined and improved
over the years. The critical question for LifeGem's partners was
whether they could extract enough carbon from the cadaver. It took
the company four years of trial and error using mostly animal remains
and those of one human cadaver to devise a process.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as it has carbon, you can use anything to make diamonds,"
said William Bassett, a professor of geology and mineralogy at
Cornell University. "To prove his point, a scientist once used peanut
butter to make a diamond."</TE>
<TE>   The quality -- and value -- of a synthetic gem depends on the care
and diligence used in creating it, Bassett said. Many synthetic
diamonds are of higher quality and worth more than natural stones.</TE>
<TE>   After a 16-week process, a diamond emerges with a bluish tinge,
like the famous Hope Diamond. The blue color is the result of trace
amounts of the element boron, which occurs naturally in the human
body, Herro said.</TE>
<TE>   There is enough carbon in the human body to yield 50 to 100
diamonds of varying sizes, from 1/4-carat to 1 carat. The ashes are
returned to the family.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, LifeGem will offer diamonds with yellow, red and clear
hues, determined by the elements not removed during the process,
Herro said.</TE>
<TE>   No human bodies have yet been turned into diamonds, but 50 are
undergoing the process, Herro said. The first deliveries are
scheduled for late December.</TE>
<TE>   A 1/4-carat LifeGem diamond sells for $3,950; two can be purchased
for $2,950 apiece. A full carat costs $22,000. The price does not
include having the gem fashioned into jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost may seem exorbitant, but not when you consider that what
you are getting is something that will last forever and can be handed
down as an everlasting heirloom from generation to generation," Herro
said. "From a practical perspective, it's not just money going into
the ground."</TE>
<TE>   LifeGem can also produce diamonds from previously cremated human
and pet remains.</TE>
<TE>   Herro said about half the inquiries the company gets are from pet
owners.</TE>
<TE>   More than one in four Americans opt for cremation -- 630,800
people out of more than 2.4 million deaths in 2000. The Cremation
Assn. of North America projects that the number will climb to 40% by
2010 and 48% by 2025.</TE>
<TE>   David Walkinshaw, a funeral home director in Arlington, Mass., and
spokesman for the National Funeral Directors Assn., thinks that there
will be a market for LifeGem diamonds.</TE>
<TE>   "Funerals used to be very traditional. Everything was done one
way," he said. "People today want to explore more and more options.
This is just another option. You let people decide for themselves
what's best for them.</TE>
<TE>   "It may not be appropriate for everyone, but there are people, I
think, who will find it very fitting and meaningful."</TE>

<HD>Cleaner Lake Erie Beckons Divers</HD>
<DH>Remains from dozens of shipwrecks, some from the early
1900s, are strewn about and well-preserved in the salt-free water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Seewer</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>KELLEYS ISLAND, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Bright streaks of light cut through Lake Erie's shallow waters and
illuminate a hulking skeleton.</LD>
<LD>   Divers float past the green moss and zebra mussel shells that
cover the anchor lift and wooden hull of the F.H. Prince, a
propeller-driven steamer that caught fire in 1911 just off the coast
of Kelleys Island.</LD>
<LD>   "To know that there were actually people on that ship just gives
me a feeling of connection to that period in time," said Cheryl
Hubans, who is making her second dive in the lake.</LD>
<TE>   "I've looked out on that water many times and had no idea what was
out there."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two decades, pollutants that turned Lake Erie into
an environmental mess have decreased dramatically, opening a new
underwater world to divers. They come to explore the skeletal remains
of dozens of shipwrecks that are strewn throughout the lake. Even
those wrecks dating to the early 1900s are well-preserved because
there's no salt in the water.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going places not many people go," said Hubans, a retired
art teacher. "It's just so peaceful. Nobody talks -- it's just you
and the fish."</TE>
<TE>   Although Lake Erie doesn't offer exotic marine life or the bright
hues found in popular diving spots in warmer climates, there are
hidden caves to discover, shipwrecks to find and countless freshwater
fish to watch.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of wrecks to pick from," said Steve Sheridan, who
operates dive charters on his 27-foot boat out of Port Clinton. "You
get to dive in your backyard. It's better than diving in a quarry."</TE>
<TE>   Lake Erie is the shallowest of the Great Lakes, with depths
averaging about 60 feet. Its western basin between Toledo and
Cleveland is littered with shipwrecks from the violent storms that
can whip up in a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   That's where divers can find rusted propellers, anchors, boilers
and chains.</TE>
<TE>   Many wrecks -- thought to number anywhere from 1,800 to 4,000 in
the lake -- are in easy-to-reach waters.</TE>
<TE>   The shallow waters are perfect for beginning divers or those who
want to keep their skills sharp without traveling too far.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest drawback is that it does not take long for storms to
stir up the lake's bottom, making visibility near zero and putting
planned trips on hold.</TE>
<TE>   "After a storm, we usually have to wait a few days to dive,"
Sheridan said.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent outing, the weather and visibility are perfect. A
predicted storm holds off, and the water is so warm that divers don't
need wetsuits, although they wear them.</TE>
<TE>   Sheridan starts his group of four divers at a wreck less than a
mile off the mainland. It's a former prison ship called the Success
that sunk after a fire July 4, 1946.</TE>
<TE>   Visibility on the dive, though, is poor and the group moves on
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we felt it, but we couldn't see it," said Charlie Gunn, a
retired electric company worker from Cleveland who has been diving
about 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   He's by far the most experienced diver on board. The others have
been diving for little over a year.</TE>
<TE>   Next up is the Prince. Its rusted remains are just a few feet
below the surface, giving the divers a glimpse of the ship from the
dive boat.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of minnows and 14-inch bass swim through the ship, hiding
in its crevices. There's hardly a ripple in the water.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clearer than I thought it would be," said 15-year-old Jack
Kroeger of Minneapolis, who is making his first dive in the lake with
his father, Barry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to find things that we can enjoy together," his father
said. "This is something we can share."</TE>
<TE>   Interest in diving Lake Erie is increasing, and Ohio is working to
establish a shipwreck preserve to encourage diving and tourism. The
preserve is to ring Kelleys Island in western Lake Erie and cover 40
square miles.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes are to have it established next summer.</TE>
<TE>   The area includes at least 30 shipwrecks, and project officials
want to have some sites marked off for divers to explore. Mooring
buoys would be set up around ships to help divers locate the wrecks
and boaters avoid them.</TE>
<TE>   The state bans divers from taking anything from the wrecks, but
years of diving have left some ships without original artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   The lake was considered dead 20 years ago -- so bad that former
late-night TV host Johnny Carson sarcastically called it "the place
fish go to die."</TE>
<TE>   But because of anti-pollution efforts that have dramatically cut
the amount of wastewater dumped in the lake and the introduction of
zebra mussels, which act as filters and absorb sediments, visibility
now extends beyond 30 feet on a good day.</TE>
<TE>   There are a handful of charter boats that now offer dive trips.</TE>
<TE>   Sheridan, who makes as many as three trips a week, spent about
five years finding spots to dive before offering charters five
summers ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There are little spots all over the place," he said. "My little
corner of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Around Green Island, there are hidden caves cut into the rocks.
Grooves were cut into rock by glaciers and underwater boulders the
size of Sheridan's boat near Middle Island, a tiny spot of land that
is the southernmost point in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   That's also where the Keepsake lies.</TE>
<TE>   The sailing ship that ran aground in 1911 isn't easily found. Its
remains are scattered.</TE>
<TE>   Hubans and Gunn don't know where it is until they see a flat,
smooth surface that at first appears to be a glacial groove carved
into the lake's bottom.</TE>
<TE>   As Hubans glides alongside through the clear water, she discovers
that it is much longer than she thought. Then she and Gunn spot the
smooth wood grain and a scattering of bolts about 10 feet below the
water's surface.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when we realized it was a shipwreck," she said. "It's
exciting. There's so many people who have no idea what's out here."</TE>

<HD>King of Crooked Car Crashes Slams Into the Law</HD>
<DH>The N.Y. man directed perhaps hundreds of car accidents
over two decades before federal agents broke up his ring and began
bringing its members to court.</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>On the night of July 16, 2000, police arrived at the scene of one of
Quentin Hawkins' "movies."</LD>
<LD>   Two banged-up cars sat on a Brooklyn street where an open fire
hydrant spit out water. Drivers and passengers reported that one car
went out of control on the slick pavement and sideswiped the other.</LD>
<LD>   But that hadn't happened. The wreck wasn't real: All of the
"victims," including an off-duty cop, were used by Hawkins in the
biggest staged-accident scheme in state history.</LD>
<TE>   Hawkins, 53, of Brooklyn, produced and directed perhaps hundreds
of car accidents over two decades before federal agents broke up his
ring and began bringing its members to court this year. His
demolition derby, authorities say, was a major part of a costly
epidemic in auto insurance fraud and set a new standard for the
hustlers known as "runners."</TE>
<TE>   "He was, in a real sense, the king of the runners," Assistant U.S.
Atty. Daniel R. Alonso said when Hawkins, nicknamed "Flint," was
sentenced in September to five years and four months in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins' cast of con men featured his two adult children, a
girlfriend half his age, crooked cops, a failed professional wrestler
and regulars at a Brooklyn bowling alley called Melody Lanes.</TE>
<TE>   One of the police officers, Edwin DeLoatch, was convicted last
month of helping Hawkins orchestrate the two-car accident in Brooklyn
in exchange for an envelope stuffed with an undisclosed amount of
cash, slipped to him at Melody Lanes. He faces a sentence of three
years and seven months.</TE>
<TE>   Also among the 67 defendants named in the federal complaint was
the manager of a medical clinic, Garri Zhigun. He awaits trial in
December for allegedly billing insurance companies for unnecessary
physical and psychiatric therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Other medical clinics and law practices remain under
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Cases of this kind prove that greed knows no bounds," Gregory
Serio, superintendent of the New York Insurance Department, said
after Hawkins' arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins thrived in an underworld populated by shady
personal-injury lawyers and medical clinic operators who rely on
runners to profit from false negligence and no-fault claims.</TE>
<TE>   The corrupt clinics exploit New York's no-fault law, which
requires insurance companies to pay up to $50,000 per person for
medical costs, lost wages and other expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Fake victims, after refusing treatment at the scene, receive
kickbacks from the clinics for seeking treatment for head, back and
neck pain, or other "soft-tissue injuries" that are difficult to
prove.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving unnecessary treatment, some phony victims file
lawsuits demanding damages for pain and suffering. The suits can reap
five-figure settlements.</TE>
<TE>   New York insurance officials estimate that no-fault claims from
staged accidents amount to tens of millions of dollars each year in
the state, and hundreds of millions nationwide. As a result, they
say, the state has some of the highest auto insurance rates in the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Fraud cases abound:</TE>
<TE>   * In July in Newark, N.J., 28 people were charged with staging
fake accidents. The owner of several chiropractic clinics, identified
as the ringleader, was charged with submitting more than $300,000 in
phony medical claims.</TE>
<TE>   * Earlier this year, California officials announced that a
statewide crackdown had resulted in convictions of 51 people in San
Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The defendants included five
chiropractors and seven lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   * In April, a law office manager for firms in Houston and Dallas
was ordered to pay $8.7 million in restitution for his role in a
fraudulent accident ring. Authorities alleged that the ring was run
by Russian organized crime groups.</TE>
<TE>   How Hawkins ended up launching his lucrative career as a runner
remains unclear. But his girlfriend testified that he boasted that
he'd been at it for 21 years. At Melody Lanes, Hawkins stood out from
the blue-collar crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "Flint Hawkins is the kind of guy who drives a nice big car," said
Steven Brounstein, an attorney for DeLoatch. "He wears nice jewelry.
He's a big talker."</TE>
<TE>   When Hawkins talked to his fellow bowlers about an easy way to
make quick cash, they listened.</TE>
<TE>   The king of the runners collected up to $2,000 in kickbacks per
car accident "victim" that he delivered to clinics. He used middlemen
to help recruit and direct drivers and passengers to have deliberate,
low-impact collisions; the fake victims received about $200 each and
the chance to file lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, Hawkins went a step further.</TE>
<TE>   He bribed another police officer, Rodney Hawkins, no relation, to
write fake reports, eliminating the need for the usual theatrics. The
officer pleaded guilty to charges that he wrote at least seven bogus
accident reports involving a total of 37 people claiming to have been
injured by phantom hit-and-run drivers.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI wiretap on Hawkins' cell phone revealed that the ring
relied on code: The scripted accidents were "movies," cars were
"cans," and patients were "pineapples" who needed to go to "fruit
stands" or medical clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins was clear about who was boss.</TE>
<TE>   "There is only one chief, and I'm the chief," he said in a taped
conversation with one of his minions. "And you do it my way."</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins got away with his staged-accident scheme until authorities
received a tip about another of his scams.</TE>
<TE>   Parents of children who were tested for lead poisoning reported
that health care workers were harassing them by trying to steer them
to certain medical clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Using wiretaps, investigators uncovered Hawkins' plot to pay more
than $10,000 in bribes to hospital employees for the names of the
children, as well as people injured in car accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also heard something else: Hawkins congratulating
DeLoatch for staging a car crash on a street with an open fire
hydrant.</TE>
<TE>   "I never would have thought of that," Hawkins said. "That was very
ingenious."</TE>

<HD>For Low Rent, Squatters Get High-End Manhattan Homes</HD>
<DH>Residents provide sweat equity as 11 abandoned buildings
are brought up to code. The deal won't cost New York City a dime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ted Shaffrey</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The early history of real estate is filled with people planting flags
or raising swords, moving in and proclaiming ownership.</LD>
<LD>   But many New Yorkers were surprised when, under a controversial
new city policy, a group of squatters took legal possession of
several buildings in the high-rent Manhattan area where they had been
living illegally for years.</LD>
<LD>   In August, the city sold 11 buildings on the Lower East Side for
$1 each to a nonprofit agency, which will hand them over to the 236
squatters who live in them.</LD>
<TE>   "Responsibility -- that's what it feels like," said Baby Monroe, a
subway musician who has lived in a dilapidated building at 155 Ave. C
for the last few years, as he looked uneasily at a spray-painted
anarchy symbol and battered skull-and-crossbones flag hanging outside
the building he will partly own.</TE>
<TE>   Monroe and others are happy to remain in the neighborhood. Without
this deal, they would have been evicted, they believe.</TE>
<TE>   Others think that they've just pulled off a big con in a
neighborhood where rents can run $2,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "These are folks who just take whatever they want and don't give
back," wrote Queens resident Sonora Chase in one of several angry
letters to local papers. "I will work and follow the law for another
20 years to acquire what they have snagged illegally for $1 per
building."</TE>
<TE>   Carol Abrams of the city Department of Housing Preservation and
Development said the arrangement was made possible because the city
does not want to displace people while creating code-compliant
housing.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the city would rather that the squatters -- who will
continue to live in the buildings while they are brought up to code
-- inherited their homes rather than be shown the curb in a time of
rising homelessness.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a last resort," Abrams said. "But it's still a win-win.
We can get 11 buildings up to code -- while creating affordable low-
to moderate-income housing."</TE>
<TE>   The deal isn't costing the city a dime -- the Urban Homesteading
Assistance Board, which arranged the ownership transfer, is
negotiating capital improvement loans ranging from $200,000 to
$600,000 per building from the Washington, D.C.-based National
Cooperative Bank, so the buildings can be brought into compliance
with city housing codes.</TE>
<TE>   The loan will then be passed on to the onetime squatters, who will
become owners of the cooperative housing. This also means that the
residents of each apartment will pay around $450 a month for years to
come -- for many, the first time they've paid rent in years, although
many have put thousands of hours and dollars into making needed
building repairs.</TE>
<TE>   A lot has changed in the last seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Over the July 4 weekend in 1995, the city sent storms of police in
riot gear and an armored personnel carrier to the Lower East Side to
execute eviction orders at many of the buildings where squatters
lived.</TE>
<TE>   After a siege and several arrests, the squatters countered in
court that their presence was lawful. They argued they owned the
abandoned buildings under the legal doctrine of adverse possession,
having occupied them for more than 10 years. Largely agreeing, a
Manhattan judge barred the city from kicking many of the squatters
out.</TE>
<TE>   One of the buildings whose occupants were targeted for eviction
was 21-23 Ave. C, called Umbrella House by its squatting founders
because of a roof leak that was once so bad that an umbrella was
needed indoors.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't feel like working 10 paying jobs to live in the
neighborhood I love," said Linda Flores De Leon, 43, who has lived in
the building on-and-off since 1989, with her daughter, now 12.</TE>
<TE>   De Leon, whose salary as a social worker would not pay typical
rents in the area, wants to keep her daughter in the local public
elementary school, a magnet school with an arts emphasis.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the neighborhood went from an open-air drug
market to a place where young bond traders and New York University
students sip $5 lattes.</TE>
<TE>   De Leon says that because she and other family-oriented people
believed in the neighborhood when everyone else was staying away, she
has earned her apartment ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Another Umbrella House resident, Tauno Bilsted, 31, has spent the
last 10 years doing electrical and plumbing work on the building,
buying materials with money collected from all who live there. "I did
not have the income to pay rent" when he moved in a decade ago, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Now Umbrella House keeps a "sweat equity" log. Those who don't
contribute to renovation of the building are evicted by group vote,
although it is not a legally enforceable eviction.</TE>
<TE>   The conditions that led to New York City's squatter culture --
which provided the inspiration and setting, a squat on the Lower East
Side, for Jonathan Larson's hit Broadway musical "Rent" -- are not
likely to reappear any time soon. In the city's depressed real estate
and economic climate of the 1970s and 1980s, many owners abandoned
their buildings because it was cheaper than paying the taxes on them.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, there were 5,662 vacant buildings in the city. But in
today's healthy real estate market, there are only 524.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1990s, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration started
to be receptive to a long-standing offer from the 30-year-old Urban
Homesteading Assistance Board to simply turn over the buildings to
the squatters.</TE>
<TE>   But it was current Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration and
the City Council that ultimately approved the deal.</TE>
<TE>   If they want to move out, the old squatters are not allowed to
sell their apartments for more than $9,000 -- or $6,000 for smaller
apartments -- for three years, with small increases after that. Each
building remains a low-income housing cooperative.</TE>
<TE>   The squatters' transition to homeowners is a new chapter in the
old story of a particular brand of bohemianism.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s and '80s, radicals, living in squats, closet-sized
studios or tents in Tompkins Square Park, defined themselves by their
rejection of the "system." Artists put up extravagant gargoyles on
the buildings to scare away developers; others squatted as a
political statement, giving the community a personality.</TE>
<TE>   This deal preserves some of that spirit, said Joe Center, Urban
Homesteading Assistance Board associate director.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lower East Side has always been a place where people have
moved to when coming to New York -- Jews, Irish, Italians, Puerto
Ricans and now the young of all races and religions," said Center,
whose grandparents settled there. "That's a tradition worth
preserving."</TE>

<HD>October Jobless Rate Hits 5.7% Amid Mounting Payroll Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEIGH STROPE</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's unemployment rate climbed to 5.7% in October as
businesses slashed payrolls for a second straight month, raising new
concerns about the durability of the nation's economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Other reports Friday also showed weakness in everything from
consumer spending to manufacturing. "It could be a rather blue
Christmas," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor's.</LD>
<LD>   Last month's jobless rate increased from 5.6% in September, and
businesses cut 5,000 jobs after shedding a revised 13,000 the
previous month, the Labor Department reported. The payroll cuts broke
a four-month string of job gains earlier this year that had revived
economists' hopes that businesses would post "help wanted" signs once
again.</LD>
<TE>   "There simply are no jobs being created in this economy and until
business confidence returns, it will remain a jobless recovery," said
Joel Naroff, president and chief economist at Naroff Economic
Advisors.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street overcame the dismal economic news, with the Dow Jones
industrial average up 120 points at closing and the Nasdaq up almost
31 points.</TE>
<TE>   The economy's struggles likely will be weighing on Americans'
minds as they head to the polls Tuesday, particularly in high
unemployment states such as Alaska, Washington and Oregon. The
Northeast has been hard hit by slumps in high tech and manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   In their campaigns to win control of Congress, Democrats and
Republicans are blaming each other for the economic woes and job
losses.</TE>
<TE>   At a Friday campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pa., President Bush
described the economy as "kind of bumping along."</TE>
<TE>   "Today it looks like more Americans are looking for work, and
that's a problem. We need to fix it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats countered that Bush needs to spend more time
focusing on the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people are not better off today than they were two
years ago," said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.). "And
instead of working in a bipartisan way to address our economic
problems, this president and House Republicans are stumping across
America urging people to give them total control of elected
government."</TE>
<TE>   Heavy job losses in manufacturing and construction and at
temporary employment firms were offset somewhat by gains in mortgage
banking, finance, insurance and real estate. Those gains reflect the
robust home sales and high levels of refinancing being spurred by low
interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government also added workers for the fifth month in a
row, as officials worked to strengthen airline security and continued
to hire people for the Transportation Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The economic recovery has proceeded in fits and starts because
businesses have remained reluctant to make big commitments in hiring
and spending during uncertainties about a possible war with Iraq, a
turbulent stock market and shaken consumer confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Another report Friday showed that consumer spending, which
accounts for two-thirds of the country's economic activity, fell in
September by the largest margin in 10 months. Sharp reductions in
spending on big-ticket items such as cars led the decline, the
Commerce Department said. Incomes also grew at a slower pace than
analysts had expected.</TE>
<TE>   "We are clearly hitting a soft spot with consumers worried about
just about everything in the world from Iraq to terrorists," Wyss
said. "I am not sure they are going to bounce out of this."</TE>
<TE>   Activity at the nation's factories also fell in October, and
construction spending increased the month before, new reports showed.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve policy-makers meet again Wednesday, and economists
predict another rate cut in response to the dour economic picture.
The Fed has kept a key interest rate at a 40-year low of 1.75% since
last December.</TE>

<HD>Uncertainty Shadows Starlight</HD>
<DH>The renowned overnight train is a big money loser for
deficit-plagued Amtrak, whose future remains in doubt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Streeter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amtrak's Coast Starlight moves north out of Los Angeles, whooshing
past scores of San Fernando Valley backyards. This being the start of
a day-and-a-half train ride to Seattle, Ken Jacobsen and his young
son have adopted a survival mind-set: Dig in and take what the train
gives you. Watch the world go by. Don't worry about the food, the
service, the fact that wafting through their rail car just now is an
awful smell that brings to mind dirty diapers.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an adventure, so you go with it, like riding a wave," says
Jacobsen, a Huntington Beach mortgage broker, one of about 20 people
in his coach-class car. "There's a psychology at work. Maybe things
won't be perfect, but the scenery will be nice.... We'd better just
sit back and enjoy the ride."</LD>
<LD>   For Amtrak, the nation's taxpayer-financed passenger rail agency,
the ride grows bumpier by the minute. Founded in 1970 with a mandate
to break even in three years, the railway has never come close to
that goal. For various reasons -- poor management, lack of public
investment, competition on freeways and in the air are among those
cited -- Amtrak is now more than $4 billion in the red and barely
pays its bills.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, an oversight body concluded that the railway should be
partly privatized and massively restructured. It said the company
should focus mainly on the busy stretch of track between Washington,
D.C., and Boston, the only corridor in Amtrak's nationwide network
that breaks even on operating costs. This summer, Congress had to
bail out Amtrak with an emergency appropriation of $205 million, and
the Department of Transportation added a $100-million loan. Now,
Washington is once again debating Amtrak's fate.</TE>
<TE>   With Congress wrangling over the federal budget, Amtrak is seeking
at least $1.2 billion, which it says is the minimal amount needed to
maintain existing service. The Senate wants to give that much; the
House and the Bush administration do not. Lawmakers decided this
month to put off the matter until after the November election,
passing a resolution that will leave Amtrak operational, with federal
money trickling in for at least a few more months.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak President David Gunn, a blunt-talking transit veteran hired
in May to turn the agency around, is confident that his rail service
will get the $1.2 billion he says it needs. If not, he said, "the
practical reality is: We could end up losing the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Among the possibilities discussed in Washington: Close down the
entire Amtrak network. Or create a company that focuses on rapidly
growing short-haul routes, such as that between Los Angeles and San
Diego, even if it means abandoning the nation's 14 overnight,
long-distance trains -- including the Coast Starlight and three other
routes through California.</TE>
<TE>   That scenario is a nightmare for rail fans, who celebrate the
history and romance of long-haul journeys. The Coast Starlight, which
runs for extended stretches along the Pacific Ocean, is perhaps
Amtrak's most renowned overnight train. But the long-distance trains,
the Coast Starlight included, are the system's biggest money losers.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Y. Mineta, secretary of transportation and a member of the
Amtrak board, asked in a recent interview: If a long-distance train
"doesn't make sense from an economic perspective, what is the
justification for keeping it in operation?" He added, "Every line is
up for grabs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aboard the Coast Starlight, as it pushes past Santa Barbara, many
passengers can be heard discussing Amtrak's fate. There's consensus:
The federal government should shell out more, not less, for the
nation's rail system.</TE>
<TE>   "Just what is Congress thinking? This is just ridiculous," says
Curtis Larsen, a vacationer, like almost everyone else on board.
Larsen, a retired minister from rural Wisconsin on his way to San
Francisco with his wife and son, ticks off the reasons he thinks
Amtrak should get a boost.</TE>
<TE>   The country needs a real rail network, connecting small towns and
cities, he says. The country needs trains, because the air industry
could be crippled by another terrorist attack. Many people don't want
to fly anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Then, echoing another favorite argument of Amtrak supporters, he
compares America with Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes no sense," Larsen says. "Even Spain, though it's
struggled so much with its economy it was practically Third World a
little over a decade ago -- they've got a wonderful system with
high-speed rail.</TE>
<TE>   "Our system? It's on life support."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of Amtrak say the rail agency is on life support for good
reason. Amtrak, they have long maintained, is poorly organized, out
of touch and wasteful.</TE>
<TE>   Long-distance routes like the Coast Starlight are often cited as a
prime example of what ails the agency. They hemorrhage money, losing,
on average, about $185 per passenger, according to Amtrak statistics.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the trains are used mostly by tourists, not by people
with a pressing need to get from place to place. Transportation for
tourists, the critics say, should not be funded by the government.</TE>
<TE>   One prominent critic, Joseph Vranich, a former national spokesman
for Amtrak and author of "Derailed," an examination of the U.S. train
industry, says lines like the Coast Starlight should be franchised to
private business.</TE>
<TE>   Like many critics, Vranich believes that some of the lines should
be sliced into smaller routes and that some could be turned into
rail-bound luxury lines.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time for some new thinking. The long-distance trains are
simply nonessential to most of America," he says. "And they are
bringing down the rest of Amtrak with their poor performance. They're
killing the rest of the system."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One Coast Starlight leaves from Los Angeles each day, coursing
along the California coast, through Oregon timber country and
Washington farmland.</TE>
<TE>   The long, silver trains typically have two first-class sleeper
cars, a special lounge car for first-class passengers only, a dining
car, a car with an observation deck and three second-class coach
cars, where passengers spend much of their journey camped out in
their chairs.</TE>
<TE>   The trip is scheduled to take 36 hours. Round-trip fares in coach
class run $216, meals not included. For a sleeper car, including
access to the first-class lounge, the cost is $660.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Southwest, United, Alaska and other airlines all
offer multiple flights between Los Angeles and Seattle every day. A
direct flight takes about 2 hours and 30 minutes, and a round trip
costs as little as $193.</TE>
<TE>   Riding the trains isn't cheap, and they almost never run on
schedule. The Coast Starlight meets its schedule only 35% of the
time, according to Amtrak. Stefan Haire, a Coast Starlight restaurant
manager, says he can't remember the last time the train made it to
Seattle anywhere close to schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "How can we ever be worth anything if we can't get people where
they expect to be on time?" he asks, sitting at a white-clothed
dining table.</TE>
<TE>   There are numerous reasons for the tardiness. One problem: The
freight companies do the dispatching. They're supposed to give
passenger trains the right of way as trains approach one another
going in opposite directions. Often they don't.</TE>
<TE>   Gunn also says an underfunded Amtrak is stuck with tired, old
equipment. The trains break down too frequently, he says. And there
is a massive shortfall on parts and replacement trains.</TE>
<TE>   "If things don't work perfectly, our scheduling gets hurt badly,"
says Gunn, recalling a recent long-distance train he took that was
four hours behind schedule. "We just don't have any spare cars."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Near Monterey, the Coast Starlight is forced to pull off onto a
siding, so a freight train can pass.</TE>
<TE>   The train is about half full by then. Many of the newcomers are
from towns on or near the coast: San Luis Obispo, Goleta, Solvang.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Meredith is one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Like many on board, she would rather sit on a train than drive or
fly to the Bay Area. Also like many of the others, she is willing to
put up with minor inconveniences, trading time for a leisurely chance
to chat and connect with others.</TE>
<TE>   "The train is a place where you can create relationships. I've
made long-term friendships on the train; that's the best thing about
it," she says, expressing a sentiment heard often. "It's one of the
few places you can go where people are very social and do a lot of
talking."</TE>
<TE>   As the sun falls, the train slides past Watsonville. Ken
Jacobsen's rail car still smells. A trip to the bathrooms reveals why
-- some of the bathrooms look like portable restrooms after a KISS
concert.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen and his 8-year-old son, Ryan, try hard to ignore the
smell. Jacobsen says he's still just attempting to maintain his
no-worries attitude. He'd rather watch the sundown -- the splendid
orange and brown hues rimming the coastal mountains -- than get
upset. "There's not a whole lot we can do."</TE>
<TE>   By Berkeley, it's time for dinner. Haire, the restaurant manager,
works the room. His waiters grind away at their jobs. The food isn't
cheap -- more than $15 for most dinners. It's also unsatisfying. A
stir-fry dish comes with dry, wilted vegetables. A steak is tough and
not hot enough. Denny's, says one diner, would hit the spot about
now.</TE>
<TE>   One of the waiters, a bald man who seems to be trying too hard to
be funny, grates on the nerves of some passengers. "How can I not
serve you?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   One of the waiter's colleagues later sits at a table and says many
Amtrak employees are simply burned out, tired of the constant
uncertainty. Many workers feel protected, he says: "They could fire
us all. It's not going to hurt us."</TE>
<TE>   The worker is referring to an Amtrak labor agreement that
essentially grants long-term severance packages, many of them lasting
several years, to Amtrak workers employed on any rail line that ends
up getting cut.</TE>
<TE>   The labor agreement is another thorn in Amtrak's side, critics
say. If the agency did shed some of its long-distance lines, cost
savings wouldn't materialize for several years, until most of the
severance packages ran out.</TE>
<TE>   Says the worker: "What do I care? I'm gonna get paid. No matter
what."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is pitch dark. The train left downtown Los Angeles a little
more than a dozen hours ago and is rolling out of Sacramento.
Passengers in the coach section pretzel in their chairs, working into
positions that will allow for some sleep.</TE>
<TE>   The train creeps forward, stopping on sidings. It stops in Redding
at 3 in the morning, Dunsmuir at 5. Three hours later it creeps into
Klamath Falls, Ore., one of the many small towns that Amtrak helps
connect to the outside world. It's clear as the passengers rub their
backs and groan that few have had a restful night. They are joined by
a few new riders.</TE>
<TE>   The service Amtrak provides to small communities is one of the
most important reasons the agency's long-distance trains are
necessary, contends Gunn, the Amtrak president.</TE>
<TE>   Look at the California coast, or part of Oregon and Washington, he
says. "A lot of people would have trouble getting out of their towns
if not for us. We're needed.... The federal government has a
responsibility here. We don't cut back postal service to small towns
because it doesn't make economic sense. We shouldn't leave them
without trains."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Krebs, who oversees passenger rail service for the Oregon
Department of Transportation, agrees. He says Amtrak is essential to
smaller communities such as Klamath Falls.</TE>
<TE>   Air service to small towns all over the country has recently been
cut and is costly. For a place like Klamath Falls, served by one
Greyhound bus a day, says Krebs, Amtrak is "a lifeline."</TE>
<TE>   Vranich disagrees, arguing that there is no town in America that
truly depends on Amtrak.</TE>
<TE>   His argument is backed up, perhaps unintentionally, by Klamath
Falls City Manager Jeff Ball. After making the case that Amtrak is
very important to the town and many small communities surrounding it,
Ball is asked to imagine what it would be like if the Coast Starlight
disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest," he says, "it's not going to make or break the
town. Amtrak is a convenience. Losing Amtrak would be more of an
inconvenience than anything else."</TE>
<TE>   The train moves through Oregon. According to Gunn, what Amtrak
really needs is enough money to invest deeply in the system's
infrastructure. He says he would buy more trains and improve track
and signaling. The agency also needs more help from individual
states, he says, the kind of help that California, which has given
more than $1.5 billion to aid Amtrak, is known for. Gunn says the
agency needs the kind of massive federal and state investment that
highways get. The $1.2 billion is just a starting point.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to gain the trust of Washington lawmakers by boldly
admitting that the railway will always need subsidies, by making
Amtrak's accounting more transparent and by tabling for now plans to
build high-speed rail systems. (States such as California are
tentatively pushing high-speed rail plans forward without Amtrak.)</TE>
<TE>   He's also concentrating on practical upgrades: spending on more
trains and track and working to eliminate rail bottlenecks -- where
multiple tracks used by freight and passenger trains merge -- that
slow speeds far below the federally mandated limit of 79 mph for most
trips.</TE>
<TE>   As the Coast Starlight moves through just such a bottleneck, near
Tacoma, Wash., Rock and Carol Peterson, two coach-class tourists from
Victoria, Canada, admit that they are weary. Maybe they will ride
first class one day, Rock Peterson says. It would be fun to sit in
the first-class parlor car.</TE>
<TE>   Now the train slices through low-slung, industrial parts of
Seattle, alongside Safeco Field, the 3-year-old baseball stadium.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen riders are standing in the aisles, eager to get off
the train as soon as they can. Without prodding, many look back on
the trip. The reviews, of the food, the service, the cleanliness, are
mixed.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Jacobsen says he wouldn't recommend Amtrak; it cost too much,
the service wasn't great and he couldn't handle the smell much
longer. Still, he notes that his son had fun frolicking around the
train.</TE>
<TE>   Then two people from Minnesota offer an assessment that would make
Amtrak chief Gunn's day. They are wholly enthusiastic. They loved the
whole journey. The slow and steady pace of the train made them forget
about the day-to-day grind of work back home.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Starlight, they say, made time stand still.</TE>

<HD>Uncertain Future Shadows Starlight</HD>
<DH>Amtrak's renowned overnight train is a big money loser for
the deficit-plagued railway, whose fate will be decided by Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Streeter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amtrak's Coast Starlight moves north out of Los Angeles, whooshing
past scores of San Fernando Valley backyards. This being the start of
a day-and-a-half train ride to Seattle, Ken Jacobsen and his young
son have adopted a survival mind-set: Dig in and take what the train
gives you. Watch the world go by. Don't worry about the food, the
service, the fact that wafting through their rail car just now is an
awful smell that brings to mind dirty diapers.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an adventure, so you go with it, like riding a wave," says
Jacobsen, a Huntington Beach mortgage broker, one of about 20 people
in his coach-class car. "There's a psychology at work. Maybe things
won't be perfect, but the scenery will be nice.... We'd better just
sit back and enjoy the ride."</LD>
<LD>   For Amtrak, the nation's taxpayer-financed passenger rail agency,
the ride grows bumpier by the minute. Founded in 1970 with a mandate
to break even in three years, the railway has never come close to
that goal. For various reasons -- poor management, lack of public
investment, competition on freeways and in the air are among those
cited -- Amtrak is now more than $4 billion in the red and barely
pays its bills.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, an oversight body concluded that the railway should be
partly privatized and massively restructured. It said the company
should focus mainly on the busy stretch of track between Washington,
D.C., and Boston, the only corridor in Amtrak's nationwide network
that breaks even on operating costs. This summer, Congress had to
bail out Amtrak with an emergency appropriation of $205 million, and
the Department of Transportation added a $100-million loan. Now,
Washington is once again debating Amtrak's fate.</TE>
<TE>   With Congress wrangling over the federal budget, Amtrak is seeking
at least $1.2 billion, which it says is the minimal amount needed to
maintain existing service. The Senate wants to give that much; the
House and the Bush administration do not. Lawmakers decided this
month to put off the matter until after the November election,
passing a resolution that will leave Amtrak operational, with federal
money trickling in for at least a few more months.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak President David Gunn, a blunt-talking transit veteran hired
in May to turn the agency around, is confident that his rail service
will get the $1.2 billion he says it needs. If not, he said, "the
practical reality is: We could end up losing the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Among the possibilities discussed in Washington: Close down the
entire Amtrak network. Or create a company that focuses on rapidly
growing short-haul routes, such as that between Los Angeles and San
Diego, even if it means abandoning the nation's 14 overnight,
long-distance trains -- including the Coast Starlight and three other
routes through California.</TE>
<TE>   That scenario is a nightmare for rail fans, who celebrate the
history and romance of long-haul journeys. The Coast Starlight, which
runs for extended stretches along the Pacific Ocean, is perhaps
Amtrak's most renowned overnight train. But the long-distance trains,
the Coast Starlight included, are the system's biggest money losers.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Y. Mineta, secretary of transportation and a member of the
Amtrak board, asked in a recent interview: If a long-distance train
"doesn't make sense from an economic perspective, what is the
justification for keeping it in operation?" He added, "Every line is
up for grabs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aboard the Coast Starlight, as it pushes past Santa Barbara, many
passengers can be heard discussing Amtrak's fate. There's consensus:
The federal government should shell out more, not less, for the
nation's rail system.</TE>
<TE>   "Just what is Congress thinking? This is just ridiculous," says
Curtis Larsen, a vacationer, like almost everyone else on board.
Larsen, a retired minister from rural Wisconsin on his way to San
Francisco with his wife and son, ticks off the reasons he thinks
Amtrak should get a boost.</TE>
<TE>   The country needs a real rail network, connecting small towns and
cities, he says. The country needs trains, because the air industry
could be crippled by another terrorist attack. Many people don't want
to fly anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Then, echoing another favorite argument of Amtrak supporters, he
compares America with Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes no sense," Larsen says. "Even Spain, though it's
struggled so much with its economy it was practically Third World a
little over a decade ago -- they've got a wonderful system with
high-speed rail.</TE>
<TE>   "Our system? It's on life support."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of Amtrak say the rail agency is on life support for good
reason. Amtrak, they have long maintained, is poorly organized, out
of touch and wasteful.</TE>
<TE>   Long-distance routes like the Coast Starlight are often cited as a
prime example of what ails the agency. They hemorrhage money, losing,
on average, about $185 per passenger, according to Amtrak statistics.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the trains are used mostly by tourists, not by people
with a pressing need to get from place to place. Transportation for
tourists, the critics say, should not be funded by the government.</TE>
<TE>   One prominent critic, Joseph Vranich, a former national spokesman
for Amtrak and author of "Derailed," an examination of the U.S. train
industry, says lines like the Coast Starlight should be franchised to
private business.</TE>
<TE>   Like many critics, Vranich believes that some of the lines should
be sliced into smaller routes and that some could be turned into
rail-bound luxury lines.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time for some new thinking. The long-distance trains are
simply nonessential to most of America," he says. "And they are
bringing down the rest of Amtrak with their poor performance. They're
killing the rest of the system."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One Coast Starlight leaves from Los Angeles each day, coursing
along the California coast, through Oregon timber country and
Washington farmland.</TE>
<TE>   The long, silver trains typically have two first-class sleeper
cars, a special lounge car for first-class passengers only, a dining
car, a car with an observation deck and three second-class coach
cars, where passengers spend much of their journey camped out in
their chairs.</TE>
<TE>   The trip is scheduled to take 36 hours. Round-trip fares in coach

<TE>   The train moves through Oregon. On the observation deck, Rita
Castellano, a retired anthropology professor, is enjoying one of the
trip's highlights: the spectacular pine trees and vistas of the
Willamette National Forest. She soaks it in, puts her feet up on a
seat. "Feet off!" barks the bald waiter, who happens to be walking
by. "Get them off!"</TE>
<TE>   Castellano is clearly miffed. She's seen the same waiter treating
people rudely throughout the afternoon. His act is wearing thin.
"He's not funny," she says. "Amtrak wants to know what their problem
is? Why people aren't using the train. That's where it starts."</TE>
<TE>   According to Gunn, what Amtrak really needs is enough money to
invest deeply in the system's infrastructure. He says he would buy
more trains and improve track and signaling. The agency also needs

<TE>   He hopes to gain the trust of Washington lawmakers by boldly
admitting that the railway will always need subsidies, by making
Amtrak's accounting more transparent and by tabling for now plans to
build high-speed rail systems. (States such as California are
tentatively pushing high-speed rail plans forward without Amtrak).</TE>
<TE>   He's also concentrating on practical upgrades: spending on more
trains and track and working to eliminate rail bottlenecks -- where
multiple tracks used by freight and passenger trains merge -- that
slow speeds far below the federally mandated limit of 79 mph for most
trips.</TE>
<TE>   As the Coast Starlight moves through just such a bottleneck, near
Tacoma, Wash., Rock and Carol Peterson, two coach-class tourists from
Victoria, Canada, admit that they are weary. Maybe they will ride
first class one day, Rock Peterson says. It would be fun to sit in
the first-class parlor car, where passengers get complimentary
cheese, wine and crackers.</TE>
<TE>   Now the train slices through low-slung, industrial parts of
Seattle, alongside Safeco Field, the 3-year-old baseball stadium.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen riders are standing in the aisles, eager to get off
the train as soon as they can. Without prodding, many look back on
the trip. The reviews, of the food, the service, the cleanliness, are
mixed.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Jacobsen says he wouldn't recommend Amtrak; it cost too much,
the service wasn't great and he couldn't handle the smell much
longer. Still, he notes that his son had fun frolicking around the
train.</TE>
<TE>   Then two people from Minnesota offer an assessment that would make
Amtrak chief Gunn's day. They are wholly enthusiastic. They loved the
whole journey. The slow and steady pace of the train made them forget
about the day-to-day grind of work back home.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Starlight, they say, made time stand still.</TE>

<HD>Accomplishing a Lot With a Little Help</HD>
<DH>Hundreds of volunteers have done their part to paint, patch
and fix up a Long Beach trailer park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louis Sahagun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over in an old mobile home park tucked between the Long Beach Freeway
and the Los Angeles River, 50 Cal State Long Beach students are
rolling fresh coats of off-white paint on half a dozen units
belonging to elderly, disabled tenants.</LD>
<LD>   There, too, sales manager Kirsten Larsen is painting a ceiling,
financial advisor Chris Young is sawing wood for stairs, building
contractor Pete Glaeser is shoring up a sagging porch, and commercial
real estate consultant Amy Witten is leading Cal State Long Beach
President Robert Maxson on a tour of the improvements.</LD>
<LD>   Is this any way to run a mobile home park?</LD>
<TE>   It is -- at the 135-unit Del Amo Mobile Home Park, the hottest
place in Long Beach these days for good Samaritans. Over the last
year, roughly 365 volunteers have arrived in waves to fix faulty
wiring, patch leaking roofs and put up mailboxes.</TE>
<TE>   Park residents still talk about 18-year-old Boy Scout Adam Hass,
who earned his Eagle Court of Honor by leading a group of 25 youths
who in April installed 49 smoke detectors in 25 Del Amo homes.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, a woman with Alzheimer's disease put a pot of food
on her stove and forgot about it. Her new alarm went off in time to
save that home, and possibly others.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to do something that would make a big difference in
someone's life," said Hass, a volunteer member of the Long Beach Fire
Department's search and rescue team. "Everything worked out great."</TE>
<TE>   It all started when Del Amo manager Betty Sundberg called a Long
Beach senior center to see what free assistance, if any, might be
available for her lowest-income tenants with health problems.</TE>
<TE>   Her question was forwarded to the local branch of the nonprofit
Rebuilding Together, one of the nation's largest volunteer
home-rehabilitation groups.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, Rebuilding Together Long Beach, formerly known as
Christmas in April, has been providing renovation work across town
without charge.The group's track record over the last decade includes
rehabilitating 169 sites, an estimated 5,600 hours of work by the
volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   The efforts have stretched the organization's resources to the
limit.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to do a better job of asking for donations ourselves,"
said Witten, president of the organization. "There are a lot of poor
folks in Long Beach who could use our help. But right now we can't
even afford a paid staff member to coordinate the work."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Witten sent Sundberg a batch of applications for
assistance, which she dutifully distributed among the most needy --
people such as a 71-year-old woman who has lupus, diabetes, high
blood pressure and a heart condition; and a 73-year-old widower
recovering from colon cancer surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting at her desk, Sundberg said, "Truth is, we expected nothing
in return for all those applications. Instead, we were blessed with
armies of angels."</TE>
<TE>   The help started descending in April when 275 volunteers arrived
with hammers, paintbrushes, paint and trash barrels. They fixed up 12
homes.</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time, Hass installed the fire alarms. "When we
thanked him," Sundberg said, "he just shrugged and said, 'That's what
it's all about.' "</TE>
<TE>   But on a recent Saturday, when the mobile home park was again
teeming with about 200 volunteers from Witten's group and Cal State
Long Beach, contractor Glaeser, 44, put it another way.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I see it," he said after scraping peeling paint off a
unit shared by Norma Reed, 73, and her Jack Russell terrier, Mrs.
Murphy Brown, "we're making a deposit in the Bank of Goodwill. The
folks who live here are making a few withdrawals."</TE>
<TE>   Reed was severely tested five years ago when a youth who was
riding on a shopping cart in a grocery store ran over her foot. The
injuries she suffered led to complications and amputation.</TE>
<TE>   For now, "This new paint is definitely going to brighten up my
whole life," she said, "and that means the whole world as well."</TE>
<TE>   It was a cloudy morning, with threatening skies, as Reed puttered
around her kitchen, preparing a cup of hot tea for Glaeser as he
worked outside. "I just hope Pete doesn't catch cold out there," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Glaeser already had a doozy of a cold. Splattered with
paint chips and mud, he pressed on with a mantra: "If everybody helps
a little, a lot can be accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Long Beach recreation major Jamie Knutsen, 26, got more
than she came for when an ailing mobile home owner peeked out of her
door, smiled and said, "Thank you."</TE>
<TE>   "After this, I'll wash the paint off and go to my other job as a
night waitress," Knutsen said, layering beige paint on some exterior
plumbing. "I go to college on my lunch break."</TE>
<TE>   Across the street, a neighbor stood at her screen door with a mug
of coffee, just staring in awe at all the do-gooders.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow!" she said. "These kids. Great. Marvelous. I mean, gee whiz!"</TE>
<TE>   As the work wound down, Sundberg recalled that other mobile home
park managers have called demanding to know: "What makes your place
so special? What did you have do to get all that help?"</TE>
<TE>   "I just asked for it," she tells them.</TE>

<HD>Secession Fight Revs Hahn Up</HD>
<DH>Mayor relishes battle, which has sharpened his focus. He
denies that figures who backed breakup bids will face retaliation if
they fail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The move to separate the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood from Los
Angeles has energized the administration of Mayor James K. Hahn,
sharpening its focus by giving it the specific goal of winning an
election -- a familiar challenge for a mayor who has won six citywide
contests.</LD>
<LD>   But critics say the campaign has also encouraged the mayor and his
aides to hide plans that might cost Hahn crucial votes in Tuesday's
election.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last eight months, the mayor has mounted an aggressive
campaign to defeat the secession efforts. Once seen as laconic and
rarely spied outside City Hall, he now holds three or four media
events a day, many in the Valley, talking about improving city
services, filling potholes and creating neighborhood councils.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn has helped raise millions of dollars and directed that money
toward a blistering advertising campaign highlighting the risks of
breaking up the city. He is actively engaged in the political
strategy of the campaign, talking to consultants at least daily and
overseeing the mail and television ads.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he has avoided talking publicly about an
upcoming 10-day business trip to Asia, where he will lead a
delegation of public and private leaders -- including some donors to
the anti-secession campaign -- on an expensive trip partly funded by
the city and aimed at boosting the local economy. He has tried to
keep under wraps a $1,000-per-person fund-raiser for his officeholder
account scheduled after the election. (These accounts are used by
elected Los Angeles officials to pay for activity related to city
business and for communication with constituents.)</TE>
<TE>   And, sources say, as soon as the election is over, Hahn and his
aides will figure out who was with them on secession -- and who was
not -- as they approve appointments to city commissions and evaluate
upcoming city contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, a leader of the Valley secession effort, said the
trip, for instance, is evidence that Hahn is preparing to dole out
favors after the election.</TE>
<TE>   The Asia trip, Close said, "is clearly a reward ... for those
people who fought against a Valley city. One thing is for sure, I
wasn't invited. I would welcome the opportunity to go on a trip with
the mayor."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Hahn defended his post-election day plans. He
said his long-term goals include making the city friendlier to
business and residents by continuing many of the initiatives he began
this year. Moreover, he said he will encourage those who pushed the
secession efforts to join him in improving the city.</TE>
<TE>   He also acknowledged that the campaign gave his administration
focus over the last few months, and he said he has enjoyed the
battle. In his first year, some critics charged that Hahn did little
to demonstrate his leadership of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a healthy public debate," he said. "It keeps our eye on
the ball.... I think it was a real motivation for us to do things we
wanted to make city government more responsive."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, who has never lost a citywide election, said campaigns
are exhilarating. "You know you're alive when you're in one," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   For months, Hahn has merged the campaigns to improve Los Angeles
and to keep the city together into a single effort.</TE>
<TE>   He has addressed residents, business leaders and city department
managers, sounding a similar theme to those varied groups. He has
pushed department heads to deliver more efficient city services, and
advocated lowering business taxes. His administration established a
housing trust fund in an effort to create more affordable housing. Of
late, he has trumpeted his appointment of William J. Bratton to head
the LAPD, a move that has proved popular citywide and especially in
the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   As the mayor touts those efforts, he ends his speeches on a
similar note. "There's only one threat to all of this I've been
talking about," he told the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce recently,
"and that is secession."</TE>
<TE>   His opponents, meanwhile, complain bitterly that the mayor is only
motivated by politics and that his goal is less about improving city
services than about protecting the downtown business interests of the
city. They say the mayor uses scare tactics to persuade people that
smaller cities created by secession would be financially crippled and
that the rest of Los Angeles would suffer as well.</TE>
<TE>   "They have run a campaign based on fear, half-information and
innuendo," said Richard Katz, a leader of the Valley secession
movement.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to their criticism of what he has said, secession
supporters say Hahn also has shied from topics that could hurt his
standing with the public at this delicate political time.</TE>
<TE>   The trip to Asia, for example, was meant to be kept quiet until
after the election. Public officials who are going will cost
taxpayers about $450,000, and though the executives who accompany
them will pay their ways, some people say Hahn's invitation will give
them entree into relationships with Asian companies. The mayor's
office will not identify the executives who may accompany Hahn,
saying it is not final.</TE>
<TE>   Secession advocates believe that seats on the trip will go to
those who helped the mayor fight secession.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's officeholder fund-raiser, scheduled for the week after the
election, will include many of those who have given to the mayor's
anti-secession campaign, L.A. United. Advisors to the mayor said they
did not want to hold the event before the election because they
needed to raise money for the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But one result of scheduling the event after Tuesday is it avoids
media coverage that could bolster secessionists' view that City Hall
is in the grips of well-heeled private interests.</TE>
<TE>   Close of the Valley secession group said he thinks the mayor
should pledge not to take money from individuals or firms that
contract with the city. "Otherwise," he said, "it just smells."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the mayor and his staff will retaliate against those who
opposed his efforts to keep the city whole remains unclear. The mayor
denies it. But as someone close to him said: "Will Richard Katz get a
commission appointment? I don't think so."</TE>
<TE>   After next week, Hahn's moves will principally be dictated by the
outcome: If either Valley or Hollywood secession passes, he will
preside over the dismantling of his own city, a personally and
politically devastating prospect. But if the breakup efforts fail, he
will be confronted with the question of whether to forgive or to
exact vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a tug-of-war in City Hall between those who
believe that when you win a war and defeat an enemy, that enemy is
vanquished and you don't have to do anything for them," said veteran
political consultant Harvey Englander. "There are others at City Hall
who believe the Marshall Plan the mayor has put together is going to
continue and be even stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn disputes that "everything's going to turn into a pumpkin at
midnight" on election day. "Nothing's going to disappear," he said.
"At the end of the day, I hope that people in the secession movement
pat themselves on the back.... They [gave] City Hall a swift kick in
the rear end and got City Hall to be more responsive."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's new forcefulness has won over some skeptics, even as the
anti-secession campaign has given him the opportunity to build
bridges with many powerful people in the city who supported his
opponent, Antonio Villaraigosa, in the mayoral race.</TE>
<TE>   Labor, for instance, has mended fences with Hahn in the effort to
keep Los Angeles united and looks forward to warmer relations in the
coming year.</TE>
<TE>   Secession, said Miguel Contreras, head of the L.A. County
Federation of Labor, "gave us the working relationship that we have.
I have the ability to call him directly or his top deputies. We're at
the table with him."</TE>
<TE>   Contreras and others said they have issues of their own that they
want the mayor to address. Chief among those is the possibility of
expanding the 15-member City Council to shrink the size of districts
and broaden representation around the city.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Lombard, president of Earvin "Magic" Johnson's development
company and the Department of Water and Power commission president,
praised the mayor's campaign for being inclusive and lauded Hahn for
indicating that he will continue to reach out to people after
election day. Lombard and many other African Americans were angry
with Hahn for rejecting former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks' bid for a second term. But Lombard and Johnson agreed to help
the mayor defeat secession, saying they were putting the Parks issue
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Others got on board for other reasons. Some simply didn't believe
that Hahn could build a strong enough coalition on his own. This was
particularly true in March after a Times poll found that nearly half
of voters citywide supported the Valley secession efforts. Those
polls have since turned around.</TE>
<TE>   But those close to the mayor say his ability to lead a tough
campaign is underestimated. In his mayoral campaign, for example,
Hahn used tough ads to help derail Villaraigosa's candidacy. Four
years earlier, he trounced a candidate supported by former Mayor
Richard Riordan in a city attorney election.</TE>
<TE>   Even the mayor conceded that his anti-secession campaign required
a kick-start in March. His decision on the police chief had alienated
part of his strongest political base at the same time that he needed
to bring African American leaders and others together to raise money
to fight the proposed city breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Aides say those were dark days in City Hall as the mayor's effort
to defeat secession was being criticized and he was essentially
telling Los Angeles to trust him on the Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's recent selection of former New York City Police
Commissioner Bratton to head the LAPD, however, has helped boost the
mayor's approval ratings. He is proudly taking his new chief around
the city, saying repeatedly that Los Angeles will become safer. It
hasn't hurt the mayor's anti-secession battle. "Some people are
saying that Bratton was chosen for political reasons -- absolutely
not," said Kam Kuwata, a political consultant to Hahn. "Will there be
a political benefit from that? I think we will see there probably
is."</TE>

<DH>Secession advocates say Hollywood would be redeveloped
faster if it were independent.</DH>

<LD>Over the last 10 years, Los Angeles has poured roughly $200 million
into Hollywood revitalization efforts, noticeably improving key
aspects of that community's quality of life but leaving some people
convinced that the city has misspent much of the money.</LD>
<LD>   The city has ousted slumlords and helped pay for the construction
of 1,000 housing units for seniors, residents with special needs and
others. Streets are cleaner; drug dealers less in evidence. The
number of homicides has steadily dropped, from 30 in 1990 to 17 in
1998 to 15 in 2000, the most recent year for which the Los Angeles
Police Department has statistics.</LD>
<LD>   Today, a new mall and entertainment complex sits at Hollywood
Boulevard and Highland Avenue, while at Sunset Boulevard and Vine
Street, a 300-unit apartment building is under construction, marking
the first major housing development aimed at high-income tenants in
decades.</LD>
<TE>   Gene La Pietra, the main backer of the Hollywood secession
initiative, Measure H on Tuesday's ballot, said this week that "there
are great improvements in Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   But he and other Hollywood cityhood proponents say that Los
Angeles could have revitalized Hollywood faster. They also contend
that the Community Redevelopment Agency concentrates too much on big
projects, such as the $615-million Hollywood and Highland shopping
and entertainment complex, instead of providing seed money for the
hundreds of small merchants who line Hollywood Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, La Pietra says, Los Angeles is strapped for money and
may not have the resources or political will to keep the revival
going.</TE>
<TE>   "The city of Los Angeles no longer has deep pockets," La Pietra
says.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over how much Hollywood has improved -- and how far it
has to go -- helped put the secession proposal on the ballot. And
whether secession wins or loses, Hollywood's economic health will
remain vital to Los Angeles' well-being after the votes are counted.</TE>
<TE>   To those who argue that an independent Hollywood would fare
better, secession opponents maintain that revitalization is well on
its way. They also contend that without the attention of a sizable
city government such as Los Angeles', it would be difficult to plan
and pay for the mix of small and large developments that would make
the area an attractive place to live and work.</TE>
<TE>   "This city has knocked itself out for Hollywood," said
Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles), who spearheaded the
revitalization effort as a city councilwoman representing Hollywood.
"We invested funds in Hollywood that were invested nowhere else in
the city for the past 15 years."</TE>
<TE>   The city's biggest investment by far is the Hollywood and Highland
complex. Touted as key to the area's revitalization when it was
proposed, the glitzy complex was supposed to attract Asian tourists
and conventioneers. But it opened shortly after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, and Asian tourists, on whom many of the
development's financial projections had been based, stayed home.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the city, which owns the parking garage at the
complex, initially charged high parking fees that kept local patrons
away, fueling a financial loss that last spring was as high as
$500,000 per month.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the retail stores in the center are struggling. Trizec
Retail and Entertainment, which owns Hollywood and Highland, has said
it will sell the property, and has taken a write-down on it of about
$200 million.</TE>
<TE>   Tomas Lagos, who manages a souvenir and candy store on Hollywood
Boulevard just west of Highland, credited the project for driving
away the drug dealers and other "bad people" who congregated on the
blighted site before the complex was built.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the huge development has done little to spur business,
which remains depressed due to slow international tourism and the
struggling economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now I don't have any customers," Lagos said. "Maybe all
day, 100 people. It used to be 1,000."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the overall effect of the project has been beneficial, said
Leron Gubler, president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. He
cited the Kodak Theatre, new home of the Academy Awards, which has
hosted a number of awards shows, as well as the Renaissance Hollywood
Hotel, which has brought in $30 million in the year since the complex
opened, according to its owner, Trizec Retail and Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   It took a large project like Hollywood and Highland, Gubler said,
to encourage developers to invest in the smaller projects that will
fill other needs in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Such work is popping up all over Hollywood, from renovated
storefronts to new shopping centers and apartment complexes.</TE>
<TE>   Hilda Evans has lived in the eastern part of Hollywood, near
Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue, all of her 31 years.</TE>
<TE>   The entrance to this part of town from the west is marred by a
chain-link fence topped with razor wire near where the Hollywood
Freeway splits the community in two, and signs covered with graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   But the storefronts along this stretch of Hollywood Boulevard are
clean, and many shops look trendy and new. By day, at least, there is
no sign of the drug dealing and prostitution that Evans and others
say were ever-present just a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's safer," said Evans, who four months ago took a job bagging
groceries at a new Ralphs supermarket at Hollywood and Western.
"There are more police."</TE>
<TE>   The Ralphs store -- which has a deli and tables for outdoor dining
-- is part of a new development that combines retail establishments
with subsidized apartments for seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the supermarket, the honey-colored complex contains
outlets from Starbucks, Jamba Juice, Ross Dress for Less and Shoe
Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall Moton, security director at the 120,000-square-foot
project and previously a supervisor at the Hollywood and Highland
development, said that this shopping and apartment complex, which is
across the street from a Red Line stop, "has brought a little
closeness to the community."</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, he said, the Hollywood and Highland project draws
tourists more than locals.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Heckler, a freelance writer who rents a house near Hollywood
and Western, said she can still see drug dealers and thieves from her
window at night. Her mostly immigrant neighbors are so afraid of the
police that several recently chose not to call the police about a
prowler. "They called each other, but they didn't call the police,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she said, the neighborhood is improving. She enjoys the new
shops and restaurants, and worries that if the area becomes too
gentrified, rents will rise.</TE>
<TE>   Ferris Wehbe, the chief petitioner on the Hollywood secession
proposal and a longtime activist and business owner, says that a
Hollywood city would make sure that developments meet the needs of
residents and small businesses. He complains that 16 years after the
Community Redevelopment Agency formed its Hollywood arm, there is
still no master plan for the area.</TE>
<TE>   "The big developers ... control the agenda," Wehbe said.</TE>

<HD>A Down-Payment on a Disaster: Families Battle for Their
Homes</HD>
<DH>Squeezed in a court fight between lenders and a tract
developer, homeowners now must pay more or lose what they've already
invested.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First, Maurice and Debi Gallarda rushed to sell their home so they
could make a down-payment on a big new house in a tract called Yorba
Linda Estates. The 4,000-square-foot hilltop home with a view of a
Santa Catalina Island was worth every penny of the $642,000 sales
price.</LD>
<LD>   But halfway through construction of the tract, the financially
troubled developer abandoned the project -- leaving the homes with
missing windows, garage doors and plumbing.</LD>
<LD>   After living in a two-bedroom apartment with five young children
for eight months and paying to store their furniture, the Gallardas
decided to move into their unfinished dream home anyway, completing
the work at their own expense and putting up with such inconveniences
as partly paved streets and no sidewalks.</LD>
<TE>   Now, more than a year later, they and 11 other families in the
same situation must choose between walking away from their houses or
paying far more than they expected to keep them.</TE>
<TE>   "My 7-year-old son's prayer was, 'Dear God, please don't let us
lose the house,' " said Maurice Gallarda, a civil engineer. The boy's
fear was stirred by conversations he overheard as adults discussed
their predicament, he said. The would-be homeowners are in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, squaring off against the two companies
that financed the project, Weyerhaeuser Realty Investors and Prism
Builder Financial Group.</TE>
<TE>   The companies are threatening to foreclose on the developer who
defaulted on the loans unless they reach a settlement with the home
buyers. If the judge allows the foreclosure to proceed, Weyerhaeuser
and Prism will own the houses.</TE>
<TE>   To settle the bankruptcy, Weyerhaeuser and Prism are demanding
that the residents pay thousands above the contract price of the
houses, which originally sold for $540,900 to $662,500, to cover back
taxes, principal and interest on loans made to the developer, and
street work.</TE>
<TE>   The only certainty is that the families will pay thousands more
for their homes, whether they settle in bankruptcy court or
repurchase their homes in a foreclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Richard A. Marshack, the trustee appointed by the court to sort
out the mess, described the Gallardas and the other residents as
"unequivocal victims who are in a horrible position." And he blames
the developer, Timothy Roberts, and his company, Compass Homes Inc.
"The legal issues in this bankruptcy are many. It's such a tangled
web," Marshack said.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, a Villa Park resident, declined to comment. Like the
others, the Gallardas put a $10,000 deposit on their new home. In
order to move in, they paid contractors an additional $50,000 to
finish some of the construction left undone when Roberts ended work
on the project.</TE>
<TE>   Other residents said they also invested money to make the houses
livable, assuming they eventually would gain title to the properties.
Resident Jeff Moore said he paid contractors $60,000. Per and Anne
Lindby said they paid an additional $100,000 for upgrades to their
$540,000 home -- on top of $13,000 for plumbing.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to walk away from the house. But we already have so
much money in it," said Anne Lindby, who emigrated from Denmark with
her husband in 1989. "If we walk away, we don't get any of that
back."</TE>
<TE>   Residents said they were pressured to sell their old homes so they
could close escrow on the new ones within 30 days of completion.
After months of living in apartments and paying additional expenses
such as storage and kennels, most families chose to accept an offer
made by Roberts when the project ran out of money in mid-2001.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers agreed to finish paying contractors on Roberts' promise
that they would recoup the costs when escrow closed, said Casey
Barnes, spokesman for the families. "He said it was OK for us to move
in because he was lining up new financing to finish construction,"
Barnes said.</TE>
<TE>   But that never happened. The developer defaulted on payments to
Weyerhaeuser, Prism and contractors, prompting the companies to file
notices to foreclose. Compass and Yorba Linda Estates LLC, the
company formed by Roberts to build the homes, were eventually forced
into Chapter 11 bankruptcy by one of the families. This stopped
foreclosure proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Privett, one of two attorneys representing the residents, said
the family acted in a desperate bid to stop the foreclosure and give
the buyers an opportunity to go to court and save their homes.</TE>
<TE>   But under bankruptcy laws, the buyers do not have to be reimbursed
for the money they have sunk into their homes if Weyerhaeuser and
Prism foreclose, Marshack said.</TE>
<TE>   If foreclosure occurs, "the lenders own the land and houses, and
they could foreclose at any time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marshack also said it was easier for the companies to recover
their losses by getting money from the home buyers. Going after
Roberts and his companies would result in years of litigation, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for Weyerhaeuser and Prism declined to comment, except
to issue written statements saying they are negotiating a settlement
with the buyers and their attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   To gain title to their homes, the residents propose to pay the
lenders the original contract price plus 5% to speed the settlement
talks, said Privett. They also agreed to pay the lenders' closing
costs and attorney fees.</TE>
<TE>   But Weyerhaeuser, first in line to be paid, has made additional
demands on top of those for payment of the principal and interest on
the loan made to Compass Homes.</TE>
<TE>   According to the residents' attorneys, the firm wants the
residents to pay about $70,000 in property taxes as well as $175,000
to finish paving the three streets in the tract and install
sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   The Lindbys and their neighbors want answers from Roberts. But it
remains a mystery why he ran out of money to finish construction.</TE>
<TE>   Yorba Linda Estates is one of several Roberts developments with
financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, 25 buyers in another Roberts project, La Vina Estates in
Altadena, found themselves in legal limbo when Compass Homes
defaulted on another loan.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, another lender foreclosed on Compass' Hewes
Park Estate in Orange. The situation at Yorba Linda Estates has
attracted the attention of city officials, said Councilman Ken Ryan.
They have met with the home buyers to see what, if anything, the city
can do, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The [buyers] are trying to be more than fair to settle this, but
they're not getting the same," Ryan said.</TE>

<TE>   The buyers have complained that Weyerhaeuser insists on recovering
all of its losses from them. But Marshack, the bankruptcy court
trustee, said the company is asserting its legal rights.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the buyers have been living in their homes rent-free
for a year. During that time, property values in Yorba Linda have
risen 25%, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think if there had been a 50% drop in property values they
would've stayed there?" said Marshack.</TE>
<TE>   The buyers bristle when reminded that they have not made a
mortgage payment since they moved in. They point out they have had to
pay legal bills -- more than $100,000 for the 12 families so far --
instead.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd prefer to pay a mortgage company each month instead of a
lawyer," added Anne Lindby. "We haven't made a house payment, but
we're not living here free."</TE>
<TE>   Privett said the residents have suffered hidden costs as well. At
least two families have had to pay capital gains taxes on the sale of
their homes because they waited too long to reinvest the money in
another home, she said. In addition, the families have been unable to
deduct mortgage interest and property taxes from the income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The Lindbys and their neighbors want answers from Roberts. But it
remains a mystery why he ran out of money.</TE>
<TE>   Yorba Linda Estates is one of several Roberts developments with
financial problems. In 2001, 25 buyers in another Roberts project, La
Vina Estates in Altadena, found themselves in legal limbo when
Compass Homes defaulted on another loan.</TE>

<CX>   Capital gains taxes -- A story in some editions of the California
section Nov. 3 about residents who accuse a developer of abandoning
their Yorba Linda housing tract included an inaccurate account of tax
law. A lawyer representing the home buyers said at least two families
had to pay capital gains taxes on the sale of their previous homes
because they were unable to complete the purchases of the new homes
in time. Since a 1997 change in tax law, however, homeowners are no
longer required to reinvest sale proceeds in a new home to avoid the
taxes.</CX>

Drought</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We've been here before, haven't we? Two days away from another
election, we feel insulted, soiled, numb, patronized.</LD>
<LD>   Lobotomized.</LD>
<LD>   We can't imagine how such insipid candidates for California
governor are spawned, and I don't know about you, but I'd rather have
car doors slammed on my fingers than be forced to watch another
loathsome TV ad.</LD>
<TE>   Those who do vote -- the shrinking minority who haven't had all
sense of civic duty beaten out of us -- will probably cast a ballot
for the lesser of evils.</TE>
<TE>   So how does this keep happening, not just in the California
governor's race but throughout American politics? How come the
country that can't stop pitching democracy to the rest of the world
is unable to conduct an election that enlightens and engages the
public?</TE>
<TE>   Lots of reasons, and I could talk about the need for public
financing of campaigns or caps on fund-raising. But today I'll focus
on something else.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sitting at home in front of the television, sacrificing the
few remaining brain cells to regular programming, and what do I see
virtually every time there's a commercial break?</TE>
<TE>   Another political ad.</TE>
<TE>   As of Oct. 15 in Los Angeles, 14,294 TV ads had been aired in the
campaign 2002 season. In the San Francisco-Oakland market, there were
13,400 ads, according to the Alliance for Better Campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   These ads are not cheap. If they were, Gov. Gray Davis might not
have spent his entire term hitting up every breathing resident for
cash, raising allegations the man can be bought.</TE>
<TE>   Do you have any idea how much money California's TV stations had
raked in from political ads as of Oct. 15? The answer is a staggering
$72,189,287, and that was before the crushing assault of last-minute
ads over the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what politics is in California," says Paul Taylor of
Better Campaigns. "No one does anything but beg for dollars to pay
for TV ads."</TE>
<TE>   We're not alone. Nationally, TV stations will pocket $1 billion
for this campaign season, says Taylor. It wouldn't be so bad if you
could learn something from these 30-second spots. But they're a
plague.</TE>
<TE>   We'd have had a better run for governor if Dick Riordan had
survived the primary. But Gov. Davis blew him out of the water with
TV ads before anyone knew whether Riordan could swim.</TE>
<TE>   TV ads are simplifications at best, gross distortions at worst,
and perhaps as responsible as any factor in feeding voter cynicism.
So what might TV stations do in return for profiting like robber
barons while performing such a public disservice?</TE>
<TE>   They might now and then drop one car chase, one celebrity puff
ball, one vapid exchange between look-alike anchors, and use the time
to help clarify a campaign issue. But if a candidate is not in a
stolen car, a fire, or the daily homicide, the chance for air time is
slim.</TE>
<TE>   "Back in 1994, the O.J. trial was taking place at the height of
the campaign season, so we would schedule major media events in the
parking lot across from the courthouse," says Dan Schnur, who did PR
for former Gov. Pete Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   TV stations in the nation's 50 largest markets air four times as
many political ads as campaign stories, according to a report last
week co-sponsored by the Norman Lear Center at USC. Of the 4,850
stations in the study, 63% had no campaign coverage, and less than 5%
had any stories challenging the distortions in the paid ads.</TE>
<TE>   "The common point of view is that covering politics is ratings
poison," says Marty Kaplan of USC. "But it certainly doesn't seem to
affect their decisions about airing ads."</TE>
<TE>   The ratings argument by TV news people is a sham. It's not like
the stuff they do broadcast has us on the edge of our seats. And a
12-year-old could come up with creative ways to cover political
issues that affect the lives of every viewer.</TE>
<TE>   KTVU in Oakland does more and better political coverage than any
other commercial news station in California. Political reporter Randy
Shandobil says there's no indication that ratings tank when his
station devotes five- and six-minute stories to the governor's race,
as it did for an entire week during the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   KTLA anchor Hal Fishman says his station hits the political
highlights. But TV news is a headline service that offers up "a
seven-course meal" each night.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't go into tremendous depth," Fishman admitted. "We're not
the L.A. Times."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody in their right mind is expecting tremendous depth. We're
just looking for that seven-course meal to occasionally have a few
nutrients.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Lear had it right when he once told me that TV isn't an
information or entertainment venture; it's a marketing medium.</TE>
<TE>   But given the fact the public owns the airwaves, and TV stations
operate at the discretion of the government, they've got a moral
responsibility to give something back.</TE>
<TE>   And if they don't comply out of a sense of duty, there might soon
be a gun to their heads.</TE>
<TE>   A bill introduced two weeks ago by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and
Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) would require TV and radio stations to air at
least two hours a week of candidate- or issue-centered programming in
the homestretch of campaigns for national office.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would also help lesser-known candidates compete with the
fat cats by offering TV air-time vouchers to those who can gather
enough small-potatoes campaign contributions. It's one more way of
helping to break the rule of big money in politics.</TE>
<TE>   I don't see why we can't take some of these ideas and apply them
to state campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no wonder people don't want to vote," says Schnur, the
Republican strategist. "How many Californians can relate to either
the zillionaire or the fund-raising android?"</TE>
<TE>   We don't have to wait until election day to know the answer to
that one.</TE>

<HD>Casino Boss Can't Cash In on Game He Developed</HD>
<DH>Pai gow poker's originator never secured a patent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is a gambling tale about a casino boss who took a seat at
history's card table and bet the house on a royal flush of an
invention.</LD>
<LD>   He watched it change the course of California gaming and sweep the
world -- then he walked away in anonymity as the revolution he
created left him behind.</LD>
<LD>   Pai gow poker is the game.</LD>
<TE>   It is steeped in Asian superstitions, and even Hong Kong high
rollers think it originated in China. But pai gow poker's first
casino hands were actually dealt in 1985, in the Bell card club of
Sam Torosian.</TE>
<TE>   The Boyle Heights-raised son of Armenian immigrants, Torosian was
trying to save his struggling casino. He bet correctly that pai gow
poker's blend of ancient Asian influences and straight-ahead poker
would deal a winner.</TE>
<TE>   But even as pai gow poker's popularity crossed cultures and the
globe -- from Las Vegas to Atlantic City, Macao to Buenos Aires --
Torosian's dreams of fortune fizzled.</TE>
<TE>   One thing was missing from Torosian's plan: a patent. An attorney,
Torosian says, told him that a game based on a 52-card deck wasn't
patentable. Turns out it was.Over the years, Torosian watched
hundreds of card games, including Caribbean stud, let it ride and
even pai gow poker variations, receive patents. Demoralized and
battered by debts and partner disputes, he eventually closed his
club.</TE>
<TE>   Torosian, a short man who sports a pencil-thin mustache and whose
dress is as sharp as his memory at 72, rarely sets foot in casinos
anymore. When he does, only old-timers or former employees recognize
him among the crowds of pai gow poker players.</TE>
<TE>   "I never forget good bosses like Sam," said Commerce Casino's
restaurant chef, Tony Ortega, giving Torosian a hearty handshake on a
recent visit.</TE>
<TE>   Torosian should be getting more than handshakes.</TE>
<TE>   In gaming, inventors earn royalties that are based on the number
of casino tables offering their games. Conservative estimates have
Torosian earning $70,000 a month, had he patented the game. Some
experts say his fortune might have reached $100 million by now.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, gaming history is poised to forget his name, just as it
has forgotten the names of the creators of blackjack and baccarat.</TE>
<TE>   "He should, by all rights, be receiving a royalty check from every
casino that uses his game around the world, and he doesn't.... But
that's gambling. Life in the casinos takes very strange twists," said
Peter Ruchman, a Las Vegas-based gaming analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Torosian, a onetime bread delivery man turned real estate
investor, was already a successful entrepreneur in 1984 when he first
toured the California Bell Casino.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Vicky, a wig shop owner, liked to play draw poker there,
and encouraged her husband to add to his mini-empire of hardware
stores and food stamp distribution outlets.</TE>
<TE>   Torosian bought the casino for $750,000. It had dozens of tables
and 750 employees, but some nights there were only enough customers
to keep four games going.</TE>
<TE>   It was a similar story at card rooms across southeast Los Angeles
County, where a casino building boom had left dealers staring into
space, shuffling alone.</TE>
<TE>   Nervous casino bosses held monthly strategy meetings at a
conference room off the main bar at the Bicycle Club Casino in Bell
Gardens. Torosian and the others agreed that they needed to start new
games. Pai gow -- an ancient Chinese domino game that means "near
nine" -- had achieved some success, but its complexities and low
revenue limited its appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Some bosses wanted to lobby lawmakers to change the state's
gambling law, which was nearly 100 years old. Under that law, only
three card games were permitted: draw poker, low-ball and panguingue.</TE>
<TE>   But Torosian had his own ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "My deal was, I'm not going to wait," he recalled telling his
fellow casino owners. "I'm going to create something new."</TE>
<TE>   Torosian rarely gambled. The only numbers he knew were on the
bottom line, and the most creative thing he had ever done was
painting a house.</TE>
<TE>   The way Torosian tells it, he walked around his empty casino for
days, letting the ideas swirl in his head. Then one night, an elderly
Filipino poker player pulled him aside and told him about a game
called puy soy.</TE>
<TE>   Puy soy is a Chinese card game in which players receive 13 cards
and cut them into three poker hands. They then play against a
banker's three hands.</TE>
<TE>   Torosian believed a 13-card game would be too slow. But, he
thought, what if gamblers could play  two hands: one with five cards,
the other with two? Players beating the bank's two hands would win.</TE>
<TE>   Pai gow poker was a perfect fusion of Eastern and Western
influences, "a modern game in Asian clothing," said George Hardie,
the former owner of the Bicycle Club.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of splitting the hands came from the ancient pai gow
tiles game, and the aces-high ranking system was borrowed from
straight-ahead poker, which spread across America on trains and
Mississippi steamboats.</TE>
<TE>   But was such a hybrid legal?</TE>
<TE>   Torosian, card deck in hand, decided to visit Bell's top cop,
Chief Frank Fording, now deceased. Sitting across from Fording's desk
at the police station, Torosian dealt a few hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'What do you think, chief?' This is going to bring a lot
of revenue in," Torosian recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "He said: 'I like it.' "</TE>
<TE>   The chief's approval was the first of several victories that
eventually won the game legal status.</TE>
<TE>   A few gaming industry veterans doubt Torosian created the game.
They say gamblers played a form of pai gow poker for years in
underground gambling parlors in New York City's Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   But no one besides Torosian has laid claim to pai gow poker,
gaming experts say, and they agree that, even if he didn't invent it,
Torosian is most responsible for its popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "With any game, there are always roots of dispute," said Bob
Parente, vice president and general manager of Mikohn Gaming Inc.,
which holds a patent on a variation of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people emphatically say he did it, and others say it was
already out there.... But [Torosian] is the only guy that we can
actually pinpoint that is directly attributable to this game.... At a
minimum, he built the market and visibility."</TE>
<TE>   Torosian launched pai gow poker on a Friday night at two tables.</TE>
<TE>   By the next Friday, 30 tables were filled with gamblers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm telling you, it caught fire like you can't believe," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Torosian squeezed tables closer together, lined them in hallways,
and pushed them close to bathrooms and entrances.</TE>
<TE>   Like gamblers hearing victory yells at the craps table, other
casino bosses heard about the new game and began driving up the Long
Beach Freeway to pay Torosian a visit.</TE>
<TE>   When Hardie introduced pai gow poker at the Bicycle Club, then one
of the largest card clubs in the world, the game hit the big time and
never looked back.</TE>
<TE>   Asian gamblers enjoyed pai gow poker's fast pace, and its borrowed
Asian rituals, like the heavy, brass dice cup that players slam to
the felt to determine where the deal starts. Casino owners liked the
game because it generated far more revenue than traditional poker
games.</TE>
<TE>   Pai gow poker, along with pan 9, which was created by Torosian's
partner, Fred Wolf, helped keep the industry afloat in its toughest
days and financed huge expansions.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody ever thought that card clubs could win this kind of money
... and look at us now with our new beautiful hotel," said Howard
Liu, an assistant manager at the Commerce Casino, which just
completed an Assyrian-themed, 200-room hotel and casino addition.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1980s, pai gow poker had jumped to the Las Vegas
strip, and it is now played worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the only table where Torosian plays it is in the
dining room of his South Pasadena home. He likes to deal to some of
his four children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Torosian lives comfortably after retiring from the business. But
thoughts of how he missed out on a fortune for his family still
rankle him and his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you realize that if we had patented that game, I wouldn't be
talking to you right now, I'd be counting the money," said Vicky,
breaking into laughter.</TE>
<TE>   The Torosians appear to have been victims of a purist view of card
games. Popular among old-time poker players, it holds that any game
derivative of a 52-card deck shouldn't be patented.</TE>
<TE>   "Sam was upset with me because I advised him not to try to
copyright it ... I told him that anything done with a deck of cards
was in the public domain," said Michael Caro, an author of numerous
books on poker.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave them bad advice," he said. "But it was advice I felt was
ethical."</TE>
<TE>   Torosian won't say which attorney gave him similar advice, but he
soon learned it was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   His one-year window to lay claim to pai gow poker lapsed and the
game entered the public domain, just like regular poker.</TE>
<TE>   Others didn't make the same mistake, including Torosian's former
casino manager, Moe Mostashari, who went on to create, and patent, no
bust blackjack.</TE>
<TE>   "Sam got the wrong advice," Mostashari said. "Talk about a lost
opportunity.... Nobody has ever lost more money by not patenting a
game than Sam."</TE>
<TE>   Torosian played his cards wrong, but he can now chuckle about it.</TE>
<TE>   Recovering from heart bypass surgery, he treasures his health and
family, and spends his days watching Lakers and Dodgers games, or
tending his garden.</TE>
<TE>   Still, when he walks across a packed casino floor and marvels at
the wealth pai gow poker created, sometimes it's as if the former
casino boss can hear the gaming world's back room celebration.</TE>
<TE>   The casino barons -- past, present and future -- are chomping
their cigars, laughing all the way to the bank.</TE>
<TE>   And Torosian's not invited. "They never even bought me a cup of
coffee," he said.</TE>

<LD>For a tough-talking cowboy lawman, Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael
D. Bradbury turned soft as worn saddle leather in the days before
retirement.</LD>
<LD>   Kicking around his Ojai Valley ranch last week, the 60-year-old
lawyer known for his political power and hard-nosed crime-fighting
style talked about his memorable ride as the county's longest-serving
district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   "It's one emotional layer on top of another," said Bradbury, who
struggled to hold back tears in the days before hanging up his spurs.</LD>
<TE>   "It gets hard," he said. "But you kind of put on your game face,
your trial face."</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury, who handed over the reins Friday to prosecutor Greg
Totten, begins work this week as a highly paid partner at a Los
Angeles law firm after an unprecedented six terms as Ventura County
district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   During those 24 years, he built a reputation as the most
influential politician in a county routinely ranked as the safest in
the western United States.</TE>
<TE>   He reigned over a golden age in local law enforcement, a time when
Ventura County went further than any other in California to shield
public safety agencies from budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   As the county evolved from a farm region to a mushrooming suburb
of Los Angeles, Bradbury tripled the size of the district attorney's
office. His deputies prosecuted cases big and small, sending 14
killers to death row and also suing a candy manufacturer for skimping
on the number of sweets per box.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury went after law enforcement colleagues with the same verve
when he felt they had done wrong. He infuriated a Los Angeles sheriff
and a Santa Barbara prosecutor by questioning their handling of
cases.</TE>
<TE>   And throughout his years, Bradbury held firm to a stubborn policy
of no plea bargaining that continues to force between 9% and 13% of
cases to trial--more than twice the state average.</TE>
<TE>   "We're known as a tough no-nonsense office, and it is in large
measure to the practices and policies that he established," Totten
said. "You do a crime, you'll do the time in this county."</TE>
<TE>   A rural police chief's son raised in Northern California, Bradbury
graduated from the University of Oregon and earned a law degree from
Hastings Law School in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Before his graduation in 1967, he was recruited to the Ventura
County district attorney's office and, aside from a stint in private
practice, spent his career as a prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury was first elected district attorney in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, he refused to deal down misdemeanor drunk-driving
cases. Defense attorneys argued that borderline cases were being
unnecessarily charged. Bradbury would not budge.</TE>
<TE>   "It was common practice to reduce those to reckless driving, and
that offended Mike," said George C. Eskin, a former prosecutor and
retired criminal defense attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury's distaste for plea bargains was perhaps most visible in
the prosecution of Diane Mannes, a drunk driver who struck five teens
on the Conejo Grade in 1989, killing three.</TE>
<TE>   Mannes repeatedly offered to plead guilty to manslaughter.
Bradbury insisted on prosecuting her for second-degree murder--even
after a jury failed to convict her and a judge dismissed the case.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors unsuccessfully appealed. After a four-year legal
battle, Mannes pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   "There is kind of a long battle of fighting cases that we think
are overcharged," said Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman, whose
office represented Mannes.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury took on his most politically perilous investigation a
decade ago, when he questioned the motives of Los Angeles County
sheriff's deputies who shot and killed Malibu millionaire Don Scott
in a bungled drug raid.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury, who investigated the shooting because Scott's ranch is
in Ventura County, concluded that Deputy Gary Spencer shot the
gun-wielding rancher in an early-morning raid in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   But he also found that the deputy should not have been on the
property in the first place and called the raid "a land grab."</TE>
<TE>   The report set off a political firestorm.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block cleared his deputies of
wrongdoing and recommended public censure of Bradbury for "willful
distortions of fact" to grab publicity.</TE>
<TE>   State Atty. Gen. Daniel Lungren also disputed Bradbury's
conclusions that the deputies raided Scott's $5-million ranch to
seize it as government property, and chastised the prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury stands by his report.</TE>
<TE>   "You just don't criticize other law enforcement agencies, that's
sort of an unwritten rule," he said. "I just couldn't walk away from
it."</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury couldn't walk away from a Santa Barbara case, either.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Ventura County investigators uncovered evidence
that Santa Barbara County prosecutors put away the wrong man, Efren
Cruz, for a 1997 slaying.</TE>
<TE>   After Santa Barbara prosecutors refused to reopen the case,
Bradbury's deputies secured a taped confession from an Oxnard gang
member who admitted to the killing.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence led a Santa Barbara County judge to overturn Cruz's
conviction. It also caused a rift between Bradbury and Santa Barbara
County Dist. Atty. Thomas W. Sneddon.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura attorney Kevin DeNoce, a former prosecutor, said those
cases show Bradbury's independent streak.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the thing people like and dislike about Mike is that he
was beholden to no one," DeNoce said. "He pressed the envelope in a
lot of areas where a lot of district attorneys wouldn't."</TE>
<TE>   Flanked by boxes in his office at the Ventura County Government
Center last month, Bradbury said he considers his main accomplishment
recruiting and training high-quality attorneys, many of whom went on
to become judges and successful private attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   But he will be remembered for more. His costly five-year pursuit
of the Ventura Hells Angels chapter stands out as both a success and
a failure.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 28 Hells Angels and associates were indicted in the
largest drug and racketeering case in county history. But a judge
undermined the case by throwing out some of the charges because the
indicting grand jury included too few women.</TE>
<TE>   Plea agreements were then struck with Hells Angels leader George
Christie Jr. and others who were released on probation. Critics
blasted Bradbury for wasting taxpayers' money.</TE>
<TE>   But Bradbury, while acknowledging disappointment, insists the
prosecution was a major accomplishment since it shut down a crime
syndicate that dealt drugs to children.</TE>
<TE>   Outside of the courtroom, Bradbury reshaped the political
landscape by securing, along with former Sheriff Larry Carpenter,
tens of millions of dollars for public safety.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, California voters approved a special half-cent sales tax
for public safety and the two lawmen persuaded county leaders to
adopt an ordinance guaranteeing the money for law enforcement
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   But the Board of Supervisors scaled back the funding last year, a
move Bradbury contends was illegal. He has consulted with two law
firms, but left a decision on possible legal action to his successor.</TE>
<TE>   Totten also inherits an office that has struggled with low morale
and reduced staffing in the face of increasing caseloads.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, an ugly fight continues between the department
and two prosecutors who opposed Totten, Bradbury's hand-picked
successor, in a spring campaign to elect a new district attorney. The
prosecutors, formerly front-line trial lawyers, are appealing their
reassignment to a county child-support unit.</TE>
<TE>   Some prosecutors say the dispute illustrates a nastier side of
Bradbury's regime: If you crossed Bradbury, you paid for it.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important to be perceived as a team player," said one
prosecutor, who asked not to be identified. "I believe the primary
motivation was that these people were perceived as disloyal and they
had to be moved out."</TE>
<TE>   Those criticisms are no longer Bradbury's problem.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday he begins work at Weston, Benshoof, Rochefort, Rubalcava
&amp; MacCuish, a downtown Los Angeles firm specializing in business law.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders say he will be a rainmaker, bringing in prominent Ventura
County clients. They say he will be paid about double the $157,000 a
year he made as district attorney. And he will receive $135,000
annually in retirement.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Heidi, have two sons, Mike, 6, and Sean, 4, and
are hoping to adopt a daughter soon.</TE>
<TE>   The couple enjoy spending time with a dozen horses, a mule, sheep,
goats and six dogs on their 10-acre Hang 'Em High Ranch. It is a
world apart from the courtroom, Bradbury said, and keeps his feet on
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't define myself as Mr. District Attorney," he said. "I
define myself as Honey and Dad these days. And that probably makes it
a little easier to move on to something else."</TE>

<HD>Valley School Trains Dogs for War Against Terrorism</HD>
<DH>The nonprofit Pups for Peace has sent 17 bomb-sniffing
canines to Israel, and eventually hopes to provide 1,000 of them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Israel's consul general in Los Angeles, Yuval Rotem receives up to
200 e-mail messages a day, many with offbeat, sometimes absurd
suggestions on how Israel can better protect its citizens against
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   But not all the messages are quickly deleted.</LD>
<LD>   Last spring, shortly after the Passover suicide bombing in the
Israeli coastal town of Netanya that killed 21 people, Rotem received
an intriguing message from Glen Yago. The director of capital studies
at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica, Yago proposed starting a
local bomb detection school for dogs, which could then send the
trained animals to Israel to thwart terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The military, police and private security firms in Israel already
deploy about 200 bomb-sniffing dogs, but, according to Yago, that is
nowhere near enough to cover thousands of potential targets.</TE>
<TE>   So Yago proposed the bomb school, to be funded primarily with
private donations. After checking with the Foreign Ministry in
Israel, Rotem gave Yago the thumbs up.</TE>
<TE>   Five months later, the Israeli Defense Forces have an extra 17
highly trained canines to sniff out bombs. And more are on the way.</TE>
<TE>   Trained in a secret location in the San Fernando Valley, the dogs
are the first offerings of Pups for Peace, a nonprofit organization
founded by Yago that hopes to eventually send 1,000 dogs to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the canines -- Labrador retrievers, German shepherds and
Belgium shepherds known as Malinois -- are purchased for several
thousand dollars each from noted breeders in Europe. The dogs then
undergo about two months of extensive training at their Southern
California base before they graduate and are shipped to the Middle
East.</TE>
<TE>   At the Valley training center, every possible bombing scenario is
simulated, using buses, cars, buildings and people.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs are trained to detect a wide range of weapons, from crude
homemade devices equipped with nails to sophisticated bombs packed
with powerful explosives such as C4.</TE>
<TE>   It was the explosion at the Park Hotel in Netanya that spurred
Yago to action. For Yago, a Jew, it was the last straw. He had to do
something to help stop the killings.</TE>
<TE>   At a family dinner, his son, who lives in New York City, told him
about the large police dog presence in Manhattan after the Sept. 11
attacks. That gave him his idea.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe if there were more trained bomb-detection dogs in Israel,
they could help prevent the carnage suicide bombers so often
brought," Yago said last week in a telephone interview from the Tel
Aviv Sheraton Hotel. "I inquired and found there was a real shortage
of dogs."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Yago was researching on the Internet. A name kept popping up
-- Mike Herstik, one of the premier trainers of bomb-detection dogs
in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of the blue I get this call from this guy, Glen Yago, asking
me if I would be interested in training dogs that would be sent to
Israel," said Herstik, 46. "Then he wanted to know if we could train
1,000 dogs in a month. Of course, that's impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Herstik and Yago quickly teamed up and formed Pups for
Peace. Within two months, there were 60 dogs enrolled in the program,
some purchased, some donated, others rescued from shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Dogs have always been a part of Herstik's life.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the kid on the block who had a dog with him wherever he
went," said Herstik, the son of Auschwitz survivors who was born in
Tel Aviv and grew up in the Valley. "It was just natural my life went
that way professionally."</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, Herstik entered dogs in obedience and tracking
competitions. He made a living training dogs as an adult. Then, after
the Alfred E. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was destroyed
in a bombing attack in 1995, Herstik focused his attention on
explosives detection.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a tremendous shortage of dogs, and given the situation
in the world, I knew there was going to be a great need for them," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He immersed himself in study. He picked the brains of every dog
trainer he could find, contacted law enforcement agencies and
interviewed bomb technicians. In 1998, he obtained an operating
license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</TE>
<TE>   The lead detective of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb
squad said he only buys Herstik-trained canines.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike has the best dogs," said Det. Joe Pau, who recently took
possession of one Labrador and has an order for three more at about
$10,000 each. "He does things with dogs that make them head and
shoulders over anyone else's."</TE>
<TE>   When Herstik's dogs detect something suspicious, they sit and
stare at the probable location. Other trained dogs merely sit down
once they sense something, according to Pau.</TE>
<TE>   "Say a Mike dog senses explosives in the top drawer of a desk, he
will stare, not just at the desk, but at that top drawer," said Pau,
who has been in the bomb squad for 20 years. "When you get a dog like
that, it eliminates a lot of work and saves a lot of time."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, one of Herstik's dogs saved Pau some valuable man
hours.</TE>
<TE>   On July 3, Burbank police in an alley spotted a suspicious car
with a man sleeping inside, and notified the LAPD's bomb squad.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that evening, a man had been throwing pipe bombs near
Rodeo Road.</TE>
<TE>   A dog sniffed out bomb material stashed in a rear taillight and a
canister of powder in the car.</TE>
<TE>   "I called Mike and told him it was the first time in 10 years we
got a find from a dog," Pau said.</TE>
<TE>   Herstik thrives on calls like that one.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me feel good when I hear my dogs have made their finds,"
he said. "When I get a call that starts with, 'Guess what your dog
did,' that's the best feeling in the world, that your dog actually
busted a bomber. I haven't got that call from Israel yet, but I sure
hope to get a bunch like that."</TE>

<HD>Voters Will Have Plenty of Decisions to Make</HD>
<DH>Growth issues and races for city councils, school boards,
Assembly and Congress are on Tuesday's ballot. But a tepid turnout is
forecast.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While local turnout for Tuesday's election is not expected to set any
records, at least 217 voters will march into their polling places
with high excitement and higher expectations.</LD>
<LD>   All are vying to represent Ventura County residents in positions
ranging from a seat on the smallest library board to two in Congress.</LD>
<LD>   While ballot measures involving development in three cities have
sparked the fiercest rhetoric, voters also will choose council
members in nine of the county's 10 cities, members of 12 school
boards, a new Ventura County clerk and recorder, four members of the
state Assembly and two congressional representatives.</LD>
<TE>   There is no shortage of choices: With the crisscrossing boundary
lines of cities and assorted voting districts, the county has printed
157 variations of Tuesday's ballot.</TE>
<TE>   For all that, election officials anticipate a tepid response at
the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Only 50% to 55% of the county's registered voters will cast
ballots, predicted Bruce Bradley, the county's assistant registrar of
voters. By contrast, 78% of Ventura County's registered voters
participated in the 2000 election, making choices in both the
presidential race and a bitter contest over control of the county's
$260-million tobacco settlement.</TE>
<TE>   In the current off-year election, California Secretary of State
Bill Jones has forecast a 58% turnout statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's a little rosy," said Bradley, who based his lower
estimate on a lukewarm demand for absentee ballots.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the most recent off-year election, Jones predicted a 62%
turnout. In fact, statewide participation dropped to a record low of
just over 50%. In Ventura County, it was about 55%.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, Bradley said, participation in Tuesday's vote is likely
to be highest in Ventura, Santa Paula and Simi Valley, where
residents are faced with contentious growth measures.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's Measure A would allow home construction on the rugged
hillsides that serve as the city's backdrop, but also sets aside open
space. In Santa Paula, Measure F would sanction construction in an
outlying canyon, virtually doubling the city's size. And in Simi
Valley, Measure B would block building in three canyons being eyed by
developers.</TE>
<TE>   Growth also is the driving force in a number of city council
contests.</TE>
<TE>   In Thousand Oaks, four of the 12 candidates are running as an
environmental bloc for the four open seats, accusing incumbents of
being excessively influenced by developers. The campaign has been
marked by personal attacks and avowals of environmental purity; one
critic even chided the slow-growth candidates for distributing a
brochure on paper that wasn't recyclable.</TE>
<TE>   Some other council races are notably fireworks-free. In Camarillo,
for instance, only one challenger is taking on the three incumbents
seeking reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere are voters faced with more choices than in Santa Paula. In
addition to Measure F, voters will elect three council members and
determine whether to split the city into voting districts. At-large
voting unfairly limits opportunities for Latino candidates, the U.S.
Department of Justice charged in a lawsuit against the city two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Council elections are being held in every local city but Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   On the state and national levels, redistricting after the most
recent U.S. census strengthened most local Assembly and congressional
incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly members Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), Keith Richman
(R-Northridge) and Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark) all are running
against lesser-funded candidates in redrawn districts that favor
their parties.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) is running
without substantial competition because her Republican opponent bowed
out to fight a recently diagnosed cancer condition.</TE>
<TE>   In congressional contests, 16-year incumbent Elton Gallegly
(R-Simi Valley) is facing a Democrat, Fern Rudin, who has not run for
office before and has collected less than $5,000 in contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara) is in a contest likely to be
closer. Capps and her Republican challenger, Beth Rogers, have
collected more than $1.3 million each, and each is well known in
different parts of the sprawling district.</TE>
<TE>   If Capps wins, she would be the first Democrat to represent
western Ventura County in Congress since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Education is also a big item on Tuesday's ballot. Three seats are
open on the board of the Ventura County Community College District,
which was rocked earlier this year by a financial scandal involving
former Chancellor Philip Westin. All but one of the sitting board
members were accused of negligence in approving a raise for Westin
even as he was being accused of excessive personal spending.</TE>
<TE>   School districts with board races are: Briggs, Conejo Valley,
Fillmore, Moorpark, Oak Park, Ojai, the Oxnard high school district,
the Oxnard elementary district, Pleasant Valley, Rio, Santa Paula and
Simi Valley.</TE>

<HD>Pioneer's Old House in Need of a New Home</HD>
<DH>Antelope Valley history buffs managed to save the 1880s
structure from the wrecking ball. Now, they just need to find
somewhere to put it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Chambers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than a century on an Antelope Valley almond farm, the old
Godde place is a house without a home.</LD>
<LD>   Built in the 1880s by pioneer Max Godde on land along what is now
55th Street West in Quartz Hill, the farmhouse was set to be
demolished recently to make way for a housing development.</LD>
<LD>   But the day before the bulldozers were to roll, area activists and
historians moved the four-room structure -- with the developer's
blessing -- to Quartz Hill Town Councilman Ed Frommer's property as a
temporary solution.</LD>
<TE>   The Town Council, which now owns the house, hoped one of the
area's historical groups would find a permanent site for the
structure and restore it as a library or museum. That was in April.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Frommer is in a bind. Instead of the pool, horse arena and
fruit trees he planned to build on his property, he's got a piece of
history.</TE>
<TE>   "My immediate thought was to save the house, save history," said
Frommer, 45. "But I also want to be able to use my property. People
called me up and said they would take some of the wood. But I don't
want to see this place go for scrap lumber. I'd like to see it used
by the genealogy society. It suits their purpose."</TE>
<TE>   The Antelope Valley Genealogical Society hopes to move the
farmhouse to Lancaster to use as a research library. A resident has
offered to donate a one-acre site at 85th Street West and Avenue L,
society President Beverlee Gurel said. But the hitch is funding the
move. The society, which got one quote for $9,000 to do the job,
plans a fund-raising raffle at its Nov. 12 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "We firmly believe in saving Antelope Valley history," Gurel said.
"Of the five pioneer family homes left here, this is in the best
shape. It's one of the oldest remaining structures in the valley."</TE>
<TE>   According to records and family accounts, Godde and several of his
brothers arrived in America from Germany in the 1880s, settling in
the Quartz Hill area.</TE>
<TE>   "The story in the family is that Max and his brothers got off the
train in Lancaster and started walking west to stake their claim.
This is where they stopped," said Max's granddaughter, Marge Cox.</TE>
<TE>   She said the brothers chose a sloping site west of what was then
called Soledad Township, because almond trees don't freeze on a
slope.</TE>
<TE>   Godde was the area's first farmer to claim his land under the
Homestead Act of 1862, which required that he build a structure, farm
the land and live there for five years. Records show he was granted
title to his 160-acre parcel in 1891, which suggests the house was
built in 1886.</TE>
<TE>   His descendants often wonder what attracted Godde to the high
desert, which was so unlike his native Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes when I'm out riding my horse in the desert, I think,
'Why did they ever come here? Why couldn't they have kept going to
someplace like, say, Santa Barbara?' " said great-granddaughter Kim
McBride. "Then I remember hearing that the year they came here, there
was so much grass that, if a cow lay down, you couldn't see it. Must
have been an El Nino year."</TE>
<TE>   The old Godde house has its detractors, some of whom call it the
"Godde Outhouse." Some neighbors have complained that the boarded-up
"shack" is an eyesore that negatively affects property values,
Frommer said.</TE>
<TE>   Frommer does not intend to keep the Godde place forever. If the
genealogical society is unable to move the house, he said he may just
run an ad: "Free house circa 1890. Must take all."</TE>
<TE>   It is likely he could unload every board and nail on EBay. But
most folks don't want to see that happen. A 116-year-old farmhouse
may be commonplace "back East" or in Europe, they say, but it's a
rare gem in the West.</TE>
<TE>   "You never see anything of that age anymore," said neighbor Bob
Sundstrom, 44, who has been driving past the house for 30 years,
always wishing to take a peek inside. Now it sits directly across the
street. "It's very important that it be saved," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's right," Frommer said. "Once it's gone, it's gone forever.
It's toast."</TE>

<LD>Cesar Orozco smiles bashfully, barely revealing his teeth, in a
Polaroid photo pinned to a bulletin board next to a gray dentist's
chair. The 5-year-old started coming this year to Children's Dental
Health Center in Costa Mesa with what volunteer Mary Ree described as
a "bombed-out mouth: teeth rotted down to little brown nubs."</LD>
<LD>   He cried constantly during his first visit and still tears up
during the extensive root canals and extractions necessary to repair
his teeth. But after each visit he hugs everyone in the office. His
dentist keeps a snapshot of him in her wallet.</LD>
<LD>   Such relationships are possible because each of the 2,500 children
who come to the center sees the same dentist each time, said Ree, who
runs the center, part of the Assistance League of Newport-Mesa, in
Costa Mesa. Ree, 53, of Fountain Valley, is vice president of the
league.</LD>
<TE>   Children of low-income families who are students in the
Newport-Mesa School District can receive services at the center
ranging from cleanings to braces, for fees that top out at $60 for a
root canal. The dental office is benefiting from a grant from the
Holiday Campaign of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a clinic," said Ree. "This is a place where we really
get to know them and we have a chance to see them grow up into
healthy children.... For Cesar, his nutrition is going to be affected
by being able to eat without pain. His whole life is going to
change."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the $10,000 the league received last year went to another
program, Operation School Bell, which provides clothing to low-income
children. Ree said it is difficult to raise money for the dental
center.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't get as excited giving money for instruments they
can't pronounce," she said. "It's not the immediate gratification of
putting clothes on a child, but it's just as worthy a cause."</TE>
<TE>   More money would mean new dental chairs -- the newest in the
office are a decade old -- and updated equipment. Between
appointments, the dentists and assistants repair malfunctioning
machines themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Lisa Kato is one of 11 dentists who work at the center once or
twice a week for $300 a day. They fill cavities and clean teeth in an
office where four patients' chairs are divided by low walls. Children
of various ages lie in the chairs, the littlest scampering off to
choose a treat from a cardboard treasure chest of stickers and
plastic spider rings after they are finished.</TE>
<TE>   High school freshman Jose Aragon has been coming to the center
since first grade, seeing Kato for half those years. "I wouldn't like
having to go to a different dentist every time," he said after having
a cavity filled recently. "When Dr. Kato treats me she doesn't go
rough, and that makes it really not scary to come here."</TE>

<HD>'Forgotten Patriots' Honored for Service</HD>
<DH>Teaching U.S. officers Japanese in WWII kept 138 tutors
from internment camps and earned them praise years later.</DH>

<LD>The ceremony felt more like a family reunion than the long-overdue
military rite it was. Toddlers waltzed in the aisles, their
grandparents and great-grandparents hovering nearby. Camera-laden kin
snapped shot after shot.</LD>
<LD>   And elderly men and women fought back tears as they grasped in
their hands the Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award, an
acknowledgment of their work during World War II as Japanese language
teachers at the U.S. Navy Language School in Boulder, Colo.</LD>
<LD>   The work of teaching naval intelligence officers how to speak and
write Japanese kept the teachers -- who were Japanese American -- out
of internment camps. It also provided the students -- who would go on
to become politicians, journalists and academics -- with insights
into a country that was little understood.</LD>
<TE>   At a time when most Japanese Americans were locked away for fear
that they might somehow be acting as spies for the land of their
ancestors, the teachers in Boulder were given free rein. In intimate
classes of four or five, they taught their students the skills they
would need to interrogate prisoners of war, break codes and translate
intercepted documents. And they schooled the military men and women
in the richness of Japanese culture by screening 1930s
black-and-white Japanese movies, teaching folk songs and introducing
the students to the concept of eating raw fish.</TE>
<TE>   The students were honored by the Navy long ago. But for their
teachers -- "forgotten patriots," as Pedro Loureiro of the Pacific
Basin Institute dubbed them -- Saturday was a day of recognition. The
director of naval intelligence came from Washington, D.C., to pass
out the certificates, apologizing for the bureaucracy that kept them
from being awarded sooner.</TE>
<TE>   It was also a day of resurrecting memories that had long been
pushed aside. Many of the teachers said they rarely spoke of their
time at the school, and few had kept in touch with one another.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised," said Miye Sano, who lived with her husband,
Joseph, on the school campus. "Some people, I hadn't seen in years. I
wouldn't have recognized them if they hadn't told me their names."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the 138 teachers who worked at the school between August
1941 and July 1946 have died, but they were represented at the
ceremony by widows and widowers, children and grandchildren. The 12
who did attend range in age from 89 to 97.</TE>
<TE>   One of them was Fumiko Morita Imai, who will turn 91 on Wednesday.
She was recruited by a professor at the University of Washington,
where she had minored in Oriental studies. She said her only previous
experience was teaching the violin.</TE>
<TE>   By teaching, she managed to avoid the internment camp where her
father, mother and brother were taken and spent the war years.</TE>
<TE>   Imai showed off a black-and-white Navy School photo identification
card and then another one from the University of Michigan, where she
taught Army intelligence officers. Her parents, who had moved from
Japan to Seattle before she was born, "were proud of me teaching,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   When asked to recall what she remembered best about her time at
the language schools, Imai giggled. "It's so long ago," she said. And
then she thought for a moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a good time with the students."</TE>
<TE>   Frank B. Gibney, the president of the Pacific Basin Institute, a
center that studies East Asian and U.S. policies, was among the many
graduates of the language school. Along with Loureiro, he had pushed
for the recognition of the people he calls sensei, the Japanese word
for teacher or master.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers, he said, were charged with a daunting task, but they
succeeded and he is grateful. "We owe you a great deal, indeed."</TE>

<HD>Growers, Labor Advocates Unite on Bond for Farm-Worker
Housing</HD>
<DH>The statewide measure prompts local groups to put aside
their differences.</DH>

<LD>Seizing an opportunity to shore up Ventura County's stock of low-cost
housing, farmers and farm-worker advocates have joined to support a
statewide measure that could help shelter those who supply the muscle
for the county's $1-billion agricultural industry.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 46 on Tuesday's ballot would funnel $200 million to
the state's primary grant program for farm-worker housing.</LD>
<LD>   If approved, the money -- part of a $2.1-billion housing bond on
the ballot -- would come at a time of unprecedented attention to
local farm-worker housing needs.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's important to send a message to the Legislature that
the voters of California really do care about housing," said Cesar
Hernandez, outreach coordinator for a nonprofit group that helped
stage a rally Saturday in support of the proposition.</TE>
<TE>   The rally drew dozens of sign-waving supporters of low-cost
housing to the Saticoy offices of Cabrillo Economic Development
Corp., the county's largest builder of affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   "Farm-worker housing is an especially critical issue," Hernandez
said. "And there are a number of stakeholders in agriculture coming
together to say this is an issue we need to take care of."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, farmers and farm-worker advocates have put aside
occasional differences to work toward passage of the bond issue. The
proposition is supported by such diverse groups as the United Farm
Workers union, the Ag Futures Alliance and the Ventura County
Agricultural Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the county Board of Supervisors and several city councils
have adopted resolutions supporting the bond issue.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents include the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. and a handful
of state legislators.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the spirit of cooperation, which some say is
unprecedented, has been spurred in part by a growing belief that in
order to keep farmers in business, steps must be taken to house those
who work the harvest.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, one policy group reported last year that housing for farm
workers was in such dwindling supply that it threatened the stability
of the county's oldest and most prominent industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel it's a very important issue locally for the viability of
agriculture," said Rob Roy, president and general counsel for the
Ventura County Agricultural Assn. "More importantly, it's the right
thing to do for farm workers in our community."</TE>
<TE>   At least three local committees are studying the issues, looking
at everything from current housing conditions to potential land-use
strategies for development. Those efforts are expected to provide the
foundation for seeking the money and support needed to build the
first significant block of farm-worker housing in the county in
nearly a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one thing the community can do to really push those
efforts forward and address a major need that will allow farm workers
to have decent, safe and affordable housing," Hernandez said.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Are Hoping for a Statewide Sweep</HD>
<DH>It would be a first for the party to take all five offices.
The GOP has done it three times.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Morain and Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Heading into the campaign's final hours, Democrats had visions of
pulling off something they've never done in this state: win all
statewide offices.</LD>
<LD>   Trying to avoid an election-day debacle, the state and national
levels of the Republican Party have poured nearly $2 million into
races for controller, secretary of state, insurance commissioner and
lieutenant governor.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats are all but certain to retain control of the
Legislature. But campaign experts believe the GOP has a chance of
gaining a seat in the state Senate, where Democrats outnumber
Republicans 26 to 14, and one or two in the Assembly, where Democrats
hold 50 seats to Republicans' 30.</LD>
<TE>   "If Republicans get a seat or two in the Assembly or Senate, and
one or two constitutional offices, that is going to look like a
tremendously successful outing for them," said consultant Darry
Sragow, who oversees the Assembly Democrats' campaign. "It's kind of
sad."</TE>
<TE>   So-called down-ballot races are overshadowed by a governor's race
in which incumbent Democrat Gray Davis has spent $51 million this
year and failed to pull significantly ahead of Republican Bill Simon
Jr. That makes handicapping the down-ballot races, in which voters
have little or no feel for candidates, difficult at best.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple million people are going to polls Tuesday to vote for
people they can't stand," Republican consultant Ray McNally said. "I
don't know how that plays out."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have swept statewide offices three times, most
recently in 1971, according to the secretary of state's office.
Democrats are hoping that 2002 will be their first sweep. Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer and Treasurer Phil Angelides, both Democrats, are so
confident of victories that they are saving their campaign cash and
airing no television ads in the final days of the campaign. Other
Democrats are not so confident.</TE>
<TE>   Among the contested races, former Republican Assemblyman Keith
Olberg is taking on Assemblyman Kevin Shelley (D-San Francisco) for
secretary of state; Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa Cruz) is trying to
unseat Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante; and Republican Gary Mendoza, a
former official in Gov. Pete Wilson's administration, is trying to
block former Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi from recapturing
his old job.</TE>
<TE>   In a state where retail politics, such as shaking hands with
workers outside factory gates, is a quaint concept, candidates with
the most money for television ads generally win. Statewide,
Democratic candidates have more money than Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   But in an effort to level the field, the state and national GOP
shifted more than $1.2 million to Mendoza in recent days and have
given six-figure sums to Olberg and McPherson.</TE>
<TE>   The Republicans' best chance of victory is in the race for
controller. Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), a loner within his
own party, is being outspent by Democrat Steve Westly, a former EBay
executive who is spending $5 million of his own money. Westly
criticizes McClintock as being an extremist on social issues.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock, who narrowly lost a run for controller in 1994, has
sufficient money to air television spots in which a narrator with a
Scottish accent portrays McClintock as tight with a dollar. Westly
insists he would be independent of Davis. But McClintock is using
opposition to Davis as the overriding theme of his candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to have these massive budget deficits and Gray
Davis as governor, you need Tom McClintock as controller," said
McClintock's chief consultant, Wayne Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Consultants say voter turnout is a wild card. Secretary of State
Bill Jones predicts 58% of the eligible voters will cast ballots.
Several consultants believe that is optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no anger," said a Democratic consultant, Gale Kaufman.
"There is complete indifference. Voters don't like either
[gubernatorial] choice. That doesn't make them angry. That makes them
not want to vote."</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman is managing Sen. Jack O'Connell's run for superintendent
of public instruction, a nonpartisan office. O'Connell (D-San Luis
Obispo) is opposed by Republican Katherine Smith, an Anaheim high
school board member.</TE>
<TE>   Among legislative races, interest groups are spending $6
million-plus on a San Joaquin Valley Senate contest in which Democrat
Rusty Areias, Davis' director of the Department of Parks and
Recreation, is running against Republican Jeff Denham. Denham has
aired seven television commercials, most of which attack Areias.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the more striking developments, the California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn., in alliance with some Indian
tribes that operate casinos, has spent more than $200,000 on an
independent campaign to boost Libertarian candidate David Eaton. The
campaign by the tribes and prison guards' union is aimed at helping
Areias by peeling votes from Denham. Eaton, who opposes the prison
guards' recent pay hike of as much as 37%, has disavowed the tactic.</TE>

<HD>Area Crime Rate Lowest in West</HD>

<LD>Ventura County remained the most crime-free urban area in the West
last year, and a falling crime rate made it the sixth safest
metropolitan region in the nation, new FBI data show.</LD>
<LD>   It was the ninth consecutive year that the affluent coastal county
has had the lowest crime rate in the 13 Western states for an area
with at least 50,000 residents.</LD>
<LD>   No urban area west of Pennsylvania had a lower rate of major
criminal offenses last year, according to the FBI's annual Uniform
Crime Reports.</LD>
<TE>   "A consistent feature of our ranking is that the community is very
supportive of public safety and interested in a wholesome
environment," said Ventura County Sheriff Bob Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,500 volunteers assist the Sheriff's Department, Brooks
said. They handle everything from religious, educational and
vocational training in jails, to search and rescue missions and
citizen patrols.</TE>
<TE>   Even as crime ticked up in the state and nation last year, total
offenses reported in Ventura County dropped by 486, or 2.8%, compared
with the previous year. Violent offenses fell slightly.</TE>
<TE>   After 10 straight years of decline, crime in Ventura County has
dropped by nearly half.</TE>
<TE>   The crime rate in the steadily growing county of 780,000 residents
fell from 22.9 crimes per 1,000 residents in 2000 to 22.1 last year.</TE>
<TE>   That compares with a U.S. crime rate of 41.6 and a rate of 39.0
for all of California. After steep increases in reported crime, Los
Angeles and Orange counties had rates of 40.3 and 27.5, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Urban policy expert Joel Kotkin said Ventura County crime
continues to drop because, in a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy,
residents move to its smaller suburban cities for safety.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, these communities are more focused on law enforcement
than, let's say, Los Angeles," said Kotkin, a senior fellow at
Pepperdine University's Davenport Institute for Public Policy and the
Milken Institute. "There's a high sensitivity to the issue."</TE>
<TE>   Barry Glassner, a professor of sociology at USC and author of "The
Culture of Fear," said Ventura County's low crime rate reflects its
affluence and family-oriented communities.</TE>
<TE>   "Where there is relative stability of income and family
composition, crime tends to be pretty stable and pretty low," he
said. "Crime goes up where there are economic problems or hardships
or where, for one reason or another, there is a lot of family
disruption."</TE>
<TE>   The new FBI analysis, released last week, reflects crimes reported
by 17,000 local police agencies to the FBI in seven
categories--murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary,
theft and auto theft.</TE>

<HD>Years of Melodrama Led to Nursery Closing</HD>
<DH>Nature, the law and family troubles took turns assaulting
garden in Topanga Canyon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In life and in love, the Sassafras Lady of Topanga Canyon never
seemed to catch a break. Not in death, either.</LD>
<LD>   Pamela Ingram certainly could have used some better luck as she
battled to turn a poison oak-covered canyon gully into a delicate
grotto with an international reputation for its British clematis
vines and delicate perennials.</LD>
<LD>   For nearly 50 years, the Englishwoman lived in the mountains
midway between the dusty San Fernando Valley and the ocean shoreline
that reminded her so much of home. Time and again, she was burned out
by fire, flooded out by storms and shoved out by landslides that
attacked the fragile garden she called Sassafras Nursery.</LD>
<TE>   Until the very end, Ingram struggled to survive. When she died of
emphysema in 2000 at age 81, she was fighting to rescue her beloved
mountain flower patch from economic calamity -- and from a nasty
family feud that is still being played out.</TE>
<TE>   Now the dispute over her estate has managed to do what even
Ingram's lifetime of bad luck couldn't do: wipe out the Sassafras
Nursery.</TE>
<TE>   Ingram's daughter is attempting to overturn the court-forced sale
of the Sassafras grounds near the center of the canyon to an
investor. Deborah Ingram Harper said she wants to reestablish the
nursery and resume its operation in memory -- and the manner -- of
her mother.</TE>
<TE>   Some say it is amazing that the Sassafras Lady was ever able to
establish her life in the canyon in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Born in India to a British army officer and his wife, Ingram
bounced around the world, living in China, Denmark and England before
marrying a Hungarian survivor of the Holocaust. After the war, they
immigrated to Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   But the husband, Henry Ingram, was a gambler. He had ducked out on
a gambling debt and was on the run from the Chicago mob when he and
his family sneaked into Topanga Canyon in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   "My father found his best friend dead in the trunk of his
Lincoln," said Harper, 51. "He fled for his life. He wore a disguise
for years and hid out in Topanga until he repaid the loan."</TE>
<TE>   Ingram was supporting the family by breeding toy poodles and
Siamese cats when the family's rented Entrado Drive cottage burned
down in a 1956 brush fire. The couple had divorced by 1959, when
Ingram used the fire insurance money to purchase a parcel on the
stream in the middle of the canyon.</TE>
<TE>   She dreamed of turning the sycamore-studded land into a lush
garden where she could grow some of the flowers and plants she loved
so much in England.</TE>
<TE>   Acquisition of the property at 275 N. Topanga Canyon Blvd. seemed
to be jinxed, however.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of buying 5 1/2 acres, as she thought she was doing,
Ingram was purchasing less than half that much. Part of the land she
thought was hers was actually an unused and forgotten next-door
parcel owned by the state parks system.</TE>
<TE>   Ingram had constructed Sassafras Nursery's retail buildings on the
parkland and was running her business out of them in 1984 when parks
officials noticed that she was trespassing. They eventually allowed
her to continue using the park property after a land-use consultant
convinced them that the Sassafras Lady had "thought she was buying
the piece of land that the Realtor showed her."</TE>
<TE>   By then, Ingram's usual bad luck had come into play. On Christmas
Eve of 1983, an electrical short caused a fire that burned down her
house on the Sassafras grounds. Losing all of her belongings in the
blaze, she was forced into a smaller building on the nursery site.</TE>
<TE>   "I no longer care about possessions because I have lost so many of
them," Ingram said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   She remarried, but the union didn't last. Before they parted, her
new husband, Bud Alley, was caught in one of the winter floods that
ravaged Sassafras Nursery almost yearly.</TE>
<TE>   He was trying to ford Topanga Creek at the Sassafras driveway when
storm water swept his car a quarter-mile downstream. The auto was
destroyed, but he escaped with minor injuries, Harper said.</TE>
<TE>   Sassafras Nursery was closed whenever the driveway creek crossing
was inundated. Every few years, the surging stream rose high enough
to wash plants from growing areas and damage buildings. Severe
flooding in 1995 that washed away part of Topanga Canyon Boulevard
isolated the nursery from customers in Malibu and Pacific Palisades
for nearly a month.</TE>
<TE>   Landslides caused by storm erosion and by an unstable hillside
above the nursery also periodically damaged growing stock and
structures. The 1994 earthquake caused even more damage.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Ingram's personal life had long been in its own upheaval.
Her oldest son had died of a drug overdose in 1984. After becoming
husband-less a second time, Ingram decided she was bisexual and
entered into a relationship with a woman.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, she drew up a will that included her companion as a
beneficiary of Sassafras Nursery, along with her daughter and her
surviving younger son.</TE>
<TE>   "I, her only daughter, was to retain the property and run the
business with her lover and her lover's sister, who had been in love
with my older brother. So it was sort of a family thing," Harper
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That was all just fine and dandy. But then in 1994, my mother was
drinking a little bit much, fell down and broke her hip and ended up
in the hospital, very much concerned for her life, as she should have
been. She needed to update her will -- her lover was no longer with
her."</TE>
<TE>   A new will and trust were prepared, but Ingram was dissatisfied
with it and never deeded the nursery property to the trust, according
to Harper. Three years later, a new one was created, establishing the
Sassafras Family Trust. But it excluded Harper's brother, David
Alley.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, the family disintegrated pretty rapidly" as she and
Alley clashed, Harper said. Ingram was disheartened by the acrimony.
"She couldn't stand us fighting. She hated it."</TE>
<TE>   Although a series of Small Business Administration disaster loans
was secured in the mid-1990s to keep the garden operating after the
string of natural disasters, Sassafras Nursery was forced to close in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Harper said that she was falsely accused in the meantime by her
brother of abusing their mother. About the same time, Harper was
arrested for stealing food from a grocery store, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "By this time, we had, part of the time, no running water and no
electricity without a generator. It was very difficult. I was giving
some of the food I took to my mother. She was very embarrassed,"
Harper said.</TE>
<TE>   Harper was jailed for 11 months. She was released two weeks before
her mother died on Feb. 26, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   After Ingram's death, Alley sued to overturn the Sassafras Family
Trust. As part of the negotiated settlement, the nursery property was
ordered sold and Alley's inclusion was ordered in the distribution of
the proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   The land sold for $600,000 last November. After Ingram's five
disaster loans, payments to four former nursery employees and
lawyers' fees were paid, court records show, Alley received $74,545
and Harper $44,979. Harper said her share went to pay for her legal
costs and the cleanup of the Sassafras site.</TE>
<TE>   Alley, 41, who has a brush clearance business in Topanga Canyon
and no longer speaks with his sister, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Harper was evicted from the Sassafras property at the first of the
year as parks officials retrieved the land owned by the state. Final
remnants of the nursery are being removed.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Harper lives in a tiny travel trailer on a friend's
Topanga ranch. A large shipping container shaded by a corral oak tree
holds mementos from Sassafras Nursery, including garden show award
plaques that Pamela Ingram won for her beloved English flowers and
plants.</TE>
<TE>   On a makeshift table in the steel container, Harper types out a
legal brief that she hopes will lead an appeals court to overturn the
sale of the property and clear the way for the reopening of Sassafras
Nursery.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother always said she didn't want to live in a soap opera.
And yet she wrote one very well," said Harper with a shrug, glancing
at boxes of Pamela Ingram's belongings.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Sassafras Lady's ashes were placed beneath a redwood
tree at the nursery as a memorial. One friend, a 42-year-old onetime
nursery worker, Walter Palahnuk, doubts that she is resting in peace.</TE>
<TE>   "I imagine Pamela is trying to scoop up her ashes beneath that
tree so she can come back and clean up this mess."</TE>

<HD>Crew Fights for Balance as Carrier Heads to Mideast</HD>
<DH>Hard-working sailors on the San Diego-based Constellation
value quiet time and find ways to carve out space for their personal
lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Garrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ABOARD THE USS CONSTELLATION</DL>
<LD>Sometimes, when this giant aircraft carrier lurches in rough seas,
sailors tumble out of their yoga poses. Delicate balances and calm
minds are hard enough to achieve when not on a warship.</LD>
<LD>   And as yoga teacher and ship doctor Lt. Errika Walker notes, the
forward bomb assembly is "the least meditative place" for her class.
But in a noisy floating behemoth where sailors sleep like sardines in
three-tier bunk beds, it has to do.</LD>
<LD>   Steaming toward possible combat in the Persian Gulf, the 5,500 men
and three dozen women aboard grab their moments of peace and
relaxation however they can.</LD>
<TE>   After round-the-clock training exercises in the Pacific last week,
the 41-year-old Constellation headed to sea Saturday from its San
Diego base. The ship's six-month deployment, said Navy Rear Adm.
Barry Costello, could put it "into harm's way."</TE>
<TE>   Even without that prospect, days "underway" pass for most who live
here in a haze of monotonous, dangerous, backbreaking work. The
seasons slip by unnoticed in the windowless 13 stories beneath the
4.5-acre flight deck. Fresh fruit gives way to canned. Young children
at home forget their traveling parents' faces.</TE>
<TE>   These sailors make such sacrifices for love of country, or because
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks propelled them to a recruitment office
or because they joined the Navy in peacetime and suddenly found the
world turned upside down.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they manage to carve out little spaces for personal life.
Friendships are forged and tested, pranks abound and movies and video
games flicker ceaselessly from the ship's thousands of television
sets. There is a soccer team, a martial arts class, a band room for
rock 'n' roll practice and near-constant access to e-mail for writing
little white lies to mom, downplaying the perils of daily life.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, as the roll of the ocean rocks them to sleep in their
tightly packed quarters, the sailors find their thoughts turning to
what many think could be a war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, however, they work. "It's not 12 hours," said Carol
Paddock, 45, of Washington state. "It's 16 or 18."</TE>
<TE>   On the wind-whipped flight deck, where the roar of jets taking off
and landing rattles teeth and sucks breath from the body, the workers
wear bright vests and shirts color-coded to tasks. Blue moves the
planes. Brown maintains them. Green handles the catapults that thrust
the aircraft into the sky. Purple fuels the jets; red loads the
weapons. Yellow keeps everyone moving and white brings the planes in
safely.</TE>
<TE>   When the jets take off or land, the whole vessel shudders and
clanks. The men and women work until their heads hurt and their
muscles scream for a break. That's why they prize their stolen
moments of recreation. Many of the women especially like yoga; they
dislike the gym because of the male gazes that they say bore into
them there.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike newer, nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, the Constellation
was built when war was for men only. Because the "Connie" is to be
retired next year, officials decided it would be too expensive to
reconfigure its living spaces and bathrooms to accommodate more
women.</TE>
<TE>   At first, many servicewomen say, they were stunned to find
themselves in such a heavily male environment. Many had served on
other carriers, such as the John C. Stennis, which sleeps hundreds of
women.</TE>
<TE>   But most say they have adjusted -- with a few concessions. Instead
of sending their underwear to the ship's laundry, for example, they
wash it themselves. Otherwise, it tends to go missing. And although
most of the men are respectful, the women say, not everyone is.</TE>
<TE>   "I got sniffed," Walker said, her voice rising in disbelief at the
memory. A man walked up to her and sniffed the back of her neck, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   There are the inevitable requests for dates (though dating is not
allowed). And as rumors whip through the ship's warren of hallways, a
woman who makes friends with a man is assumed to be his lover.</TE>
<TE>   And always, there are the eyes, hungrier as the ship is at sea
longer, following the women wherever they go.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost easier to ignore it than to be the [shrew] on the
ship," said Lt. Sarah Copeland of Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she said, these are minor annoyances, small sacrifices
among many that she gladly makes for her country. "I'm very
patriotic," she said, her blue eyes shining and her face becoming
serious as she sat in her narrow stateroom next to an immaculate
desk. "I'm doing a service for my country."</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Mark Fox, commander of the ship's 72 aircraft, said that
sense of service and sacrifice has grown visibly in recent months.
"There's a much greater sense of mission," said the pilot, who chokes
up as he discusses his responsibility to those under his command.</TE>
<TE>   Down another claustrophobic hallway, Ensign Karen Gossard, 25,
pondered the ship's mission. "You talk about it in jokes," she said.
"You don't look at the big picture.... It would be so overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   Gossard's stateroom is plastered with pictures of her smiling
daughter. She is 9 months old, and she'll be at least 15 months --
walking and talking -- by the time her mother sees her again.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Shipley, a fighter pilot from Summit, N.J., views the prospect
of combat philosophically. "Somebody's got to do it," he said. "It
might as well be us."</TE>
<TE>   "Any intelligent human being with morals is going to question what
he does," he added. But Shipley, who flew missions over Kosovo in the
1990s, said he sleeps more easily, knowing that George W. Bush
occupies the White House.</TE>
<TE>   His Marine squadron's office looks like a theme-park exhibit. Two
garish paintings of snakes guard the door in honor of the group's
name: Death Rattlers. Brown netting floats from the ceiling in great
plumes, and the chairs are upholstered in dark-green camouflage. The
pilots lounge here in their flight suits, or work out in the gym or
on the stationary bicycles that are tucked into almost every unused
corner of the ship.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, they eat. The ship serves 18,000 meals a day
(imagine the food in your school cafeteria) and countless cups of
coffee. It comes labeled strong and weak. Decaf is not an option.</TE>
<TE>   In their nearby rooms, which accommodate more than 100 men in
stacked beds, almost everyone seems to have a video game console at
the ready. Playing mock sports or war games is a great way to relax,
they say.</TE>
<TE>   So is enjoying a joke at a friend's expense.</TE>
<TE>   "People like to find out what your weakness is and jab at it,"
said Mark Hawkins, a 32-year-old pilot from Tulsa, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   Favorite pranks include "channel fever," said Seaman Frank
Pertnoy, 37, drawing on a cigarette outside the cavernous hangar bay,
where airplanes are repaired.</TE>
<TE>   Pertnoy said he had almost pulled off the channel fever prank a
few days before. He persuaded a fellow sailor that the victim needed
a shot against deadly channel fever (there's no such thing) before
going ashore. But the medic who was in on the gag, poised to give the
injection of harmless saline, broke into guffaws. Joke over.</TE>
<TE>   One reason such pranks fly is that the vast majority of the 5,500
sailors on board are in their late teens and early 20s, and they're
not very worldly.</TE>
<TE>   "You're taking care of a bunch of 19-year-olds," said Lt. Patrick
Fernandes, 32, sitting in the officers' mess near midnight, his eyes
glassy with fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   Between jokes and bites, Fernandes said that, though he is a pilot
now, he remembers what it was like to be a young enlisted man: "A lot
of them -- it's their first time away from home."</TE>

<LD>A shallow bluff-top trench covered with ice plant overlooks the
coastline and marks the spot where infantrymen once guarded Los
Angeles Harbor against a Japanese invasion. Ft. MacArthur, now the
centerpiece of Angels Gate Park, was the "Guardian of Los Angeles,"
the coast's first line of defense from 1914 through 1982.</LD>
<LD>   More than half a century ago, these peaceful hills bristled with
30,000 soldiers, 5,000 feet of tunnels, gun crews, machine-gunners
and aircraft spotters. The fort, one of nine along the California
coast, was named for Civil War hero Lt. Gen. Arthur MacArthur, father
of Gen. Douglas MacArthur.</LD>
<LD>   Today, it's a reminder of World War II's profound effect on the
Pacific Coast, as well as evidence that today's anxieties about
terrorism are nothing new. Back then, people on this side of the
ocean lived in fear. Newspaper stories asked readers to heed
blackouts, prepare for air raids and learn to extinguish incendiary
bombs.</LD>
<TE>   Before Pearl Harbor, no one dreamed that Ft. MacArthur -- the only
fort in the nation with 14-inch disappearing gun batteries -- would
actually be called upon to defend the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   But after Dec. 7, 1941, nine Japanese submarines moved east to
target merchant ships off the Pacific Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Just 13 days after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese sub Nishino
torpedoed and sank the tanker Emidio off the coast of Eureka, Calif.,
killing five seamen.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, the 440-foot tanker Montebello was torpedoed by
the Matsummura off the coast of Cambria. The tanker went down in
about 900 feet of water with its cargo -- 75,000 barrels of crude
oil. As the crew escaped in lifeboats, the submarine surfaced and
opened fire with its deck gun. Miraculously, all 38 of the Montebello
crew members survived.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Montebello sits upright on the southern edge of the
Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, its millions of gallons of
oil intact.</TE>
<TE>   On Christmas Eve 1941, soldiers at Ft. MacArthur watched in
disbelief as a torpedo struck the lumber freighter Absaroka five
miles offshore. Badly damaged, the ship limped into the harbor with
one of its sailors dead.</TE>
<TE>   Military aircraft scrambled to intercept the raider, and the next
day headlines screamed: "Army Flyer Sinks Coast Raider. Air Filled
With Debris as Nippon Submarine Is Destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   There was debris, all right, but it turned out to be the remains
of the fishing barge Kohala, a victim of American warplanes' friendly
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Arming the Pier</TE>
<TE>   Ed Ries watched the torpedo strike from the deck of a Navy
minesweeper off San Pedro. Afterward, "although the sub was long
gone, fear spread and on Christmas Day soldiers from Ft. MacArthur
set up field artillery and machine guns at the end of the Redondo
pier," he said in an interview from San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few days, six other tankers were attacked off the
California and Oregon coasts, but escaped with little or no damage.</TE>
<TE>   Other ships along the West Coast would be sunk by Japanese
submarines in the coming months, and at least eight more lives would
be lost. The Japanese would also invade Kiska and Attu in Alaska's
Aleutian Islands in June 1942, killing 38 people and wounding 28
others -- the first time invaders had captured U.S. territory since
the War of 1812. It took U.S. forces several weeks and 500 lives to
retake the islands a few months later. Nearly all 2,350 of the
Japanese trying to hold the islands died.</TE>
<TE>   The first attack on the U.S. mainland came Feb. 23, 1942, in the
midst of one of President Roosevelt's fireside chats. A Japanese
submarine rose out of the sea at Goleta, 12 miles north of Santa
Barbara, fired 13 shells at the Ellwood oil field and caused $500 in
damage. Oil field supervisors handed out pitchforks and told workers
to defend the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Although no one was hurt, the enemy's proximity had a profound
psychological effect on coast dwellers and confirmed public fears
that Japan was capable of bringing war to America's doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, in the predawn darkness, the worst fears seemed to
be coming true. The dreaded five-blast signal of an impending attack
was sounded along the Southern California coast. Radar had detected
an unidentified object that was widely believed to herald a Japanese
air raid, triggering a five-hour blackout.</TE>
<TE>   Searchlights pierced the sky and anti-aircraft guns yammered for
an hour, loosing 1,430 shells in what became known as the "Battle of
Los Angeles." The noise awakened thousands who either hid under their
beds or switched on their lights and rushed outside.</TE>
<TE>   Air raid wardens desperately tried to enforce the blackout. In
Pasadena, a warden broke his hip when he fell from a retaining wall
while urging occupants of an apartment house to shut off their
lights. Another warden gashed his leg kicking out the window of a
Hollywood store, and another sprained his ankle jumping over a
Hollywood fence. Los Angeles resident Eve Clayton was arrested for
leaving her lights on while intoxicated.</TE>
<TE>   'Blackout Babies'</TE>
<TE>   But life continued. Hospitals reported that the stork delivered 14
babies while the guns roared. The new arrivals were dubbed "blackout
babies."</TE>
<TE>   A barrage of bullets came from regular citizens as well as the
Home Guard militia, which opened fire from atop Patriotic Hall in Los
Angeles. In the melee, a round hit a small plane that crashed near
185th Street and Vermont Avenue, injuring the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Shell fragments fell from the sky, littering the streets and
damaging a number of homes and buildings. An unexploded shell crashed
through the kitchen roof of Dr. F.W. Stewart in Long Beach. He was
unhurt. Another shell cut a good-sized divot from a golf course. The
sheriff arrested 20 Japanese Americans, accusing them of firing
flares from their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Five deaths -- three in traffic accidents, two the result of heart
attacks -- were attributed to the blackout.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, there had been no enemy aircraft over Los
Angeles. The Army called the incident a case of the jitters.</TE>
<TE>   But real Japanese forays continued. On Sept. 9, 1942, two pilots
catapulted in their seaplane off the 30-foot deck of a Japanese
submarine and dropped two incendiary bombs near the coastal town of
Brookings, Ore. The idea was to start forest fires that would spread
to the cities, causing panic, but that didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   On May 21, 1944, the San Pedro-bound tanker Neches hit a Japanese
mine that was believed to have drifted from somewhere in the South
Pacific to 60 miles off the San Pedro coast, according to Steve
Lawson, a researcher with California Wreck Divers. The tanker limped
into the harbor with a 15-by-22-foot hole in its bow, but no one was
hurt.</TE>
<TE>   In 1945, about 355 unmanned balloon bombs crafted of durable rice
paper reached U.S. territory via the jet stream. The devices, 70 feet
high and 30 feet in diameter, were intended to cause panic and start
forest fires. They, too, failed, but there were casualties: Six
picnickers in Bly, Ore., died when one of them touched the fallen
device and it exploded.</TE>
<TE>   A rare balloon bomb with a rubber coating and radio transmitter
was found 66 miles off San Pedro. Another blasted a crater in the dry
bed of the Santa Clara River near Saticoy in Ventura County. An
entire balloon was found in Moorpark, its untriggered incendiary
bombs intact.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of balloon bombs and remnants were found throughout the
United States, but the attacks weren't revealed at the time. The
media cooperated with the government to prevent the Japanese from
knowing whether their unassuming weapons had made it to American
shores.</TE>
<TE>   Patriotic Japanese schoolchildren had crafted more than 10,000
balloons as part of the war effort. In 1987, several tried to atone.
They folded 1,000 paper cranes, a Japanese symbol of healing and
peace, and sent them to the families of the Oregon picnickers. An
excerpt from one of the accompanying letters:</TE>
<TE>   "We participated in the building of weapons used to kill people
without understanding much beyond the knowledge that America was our
adversary in a war. To think that the weapons we made took your lives
as you were out on a picnic! We were overwhelmed with deep sorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Duty Discharged</TE>
<TE>   When peace came in 1945, Ft. MacArthur became a separation center
where more than 150,000 soldiers received discharge papers.</TE>
<TE>   During the Cold War, Ft. MacArthur was the headquarters for Nike
Missile site bases that were up to 70 miles away. The fort included a
cemetery for the dogs that helped guard the sprawling bases.</TE>
<TE>   Today, part of the fort is submerged under Cabrillo Marina, but
most vestiges remain. Old barracks are used as classrooms for the Los
Angeles Unified School District and the Marine Mammal Care Center.
Former Army and Navy officers' mansion-like houses and administration
buildings belong to the Air Force. And the artillery bunker that
houses the 20-acre Ft. MacArthur Military Museum is listed on the
National Register of Historic Places.</TE>
<TE>   Historic battles are re-created and weapons of war are on display
at the museum, but the big guns are gone -- turned to scrap when
airplanes and missiles rendered them obsolete.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the fort was deeded to the city of Los Angeles under the
federal Lands to Parks program in the mid-1970s, but a few soldiers
remained until 1982.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Going to Asia to Boost Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn plans a 10-day mission to Asia  to
boost tourism, enhance the environmental operations at the Port of
Los Angeles, promote the use of LAX and regional airports and bring
more business opportunities to local companies.</LD>
<LD>   Leaving with the mayor Nov. 16 will be City Council President Alex
Padilla, Councilman Eric Garcetti and Councilwoman Janice Hahn, along
with six members of Hahn's staff and three representatives each from
the airport, the port and the Department of Water and Power. A
delegation of business executives, whose names have not been released
by the mayor's office, also will be accompanying the mayor, but they
will pay their own way.</LD>
<LD>   The trip is to include stops in Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo,
Hong Kong and Taipei, and is expected to cost about $450,000.</LD>
<TE>   The mayor has been planning the trip since the terrorist attacks
last year accelerated a downturn in the local economy, aides said.
Hahn expects to return with agreements and contracts designed to help
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still suffering the effects of a bad economy in Asia,
especially in Japan," Hahn said. "I think we need to drum up some
business, convince people that we need, not only tourists, but we
need to continue to have investment both ways -- our companies should
have opportunities in Asia as well. It's really about bringing more
dollars back here to Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   To help boost tourism, the mayor will hold several "splashy" press
conferences, aides said, promoting the city, its sports teams, its
movies and its history. The mayor will meet with tourism officials
and tour operators, as well.</TE>
<TE>   The Asian market supplies a huge portion of the tourism dollars in
Los Angeles, though it has been declining over the last couple of
years. The new shopping complex at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland
Avenue even has a duty-free store for those visitors.</TE>
<TE>   For the port, the mayor is hoping to convince shipping line
officials to contract with the city for electricity, thereby
eliminating their use of bunker fuel, which increases emissions and
pollutants. Such contracts would be a revenue source for the city
because these shipping lines would contract with the DWP, and they
would address environmentalists' concerns, said Deputy Mayor Troy
Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also is to talk to Asian airline carriers about the LAX
master plan to promote its benefits, and also to encourage more use
of such regional airports as Ontario. The mayor's trip to Mexico City
last year helped complete agreements for airlines there to begin
using Ontario.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Inquiry Is Linked to Utah Abduction</HD>
<DH>Prosecutor in Buena Park fondling case is suspended after
the defendant becomes a figure in Elizabeth Smart investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County prosecutor's handling of a local sexual battery case
is under scrutiny after Utah detectives began investigating whether
the defendant played a role while out on bail in the high-profile
kidnapping of a Salt Lake City girl last summer.</LD>
<LD>   The inquiry by Utah authorities led Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas to suspend Deputy Dist. Atty. Randy Payne, the veteran
sex-crimes prosecutor who handled the case involving two young female
victims from Buena Park earlier this year, according to officials
familiar with the situation.</LD>
<LD>   James Witbaard, 51, was arrested in January on suspicion of
fondling the two girls, who lived in his neighborhood. Witbaard spent
23 days in jail before posting bail. He pleaded guilty in July to
felony sexual battery and was sentenced to time served plus five
years' probation and counseling.</LD>
<TE>   In Salt Lake City, Elizabeth Smart was snatched at gunpoint from
her home June 5 while Witbaard was out on bail. The 14-year-old girl
is still missing.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City police became interested in Witbaard after learning
that he visited Utah last summer, said Salt Lake City Police Capt.
Cory Lyman, commander of a task force investigating Smart's
disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Lyman stressed that Witbaard is only one of several people whom
investigators are examining and that they have no direct evidence
linking him to the Smart abduction.</TE>
<TE>   Witbaard's attorney said his client had nothing to do with the
Utah kidnapping and predicted that detectives will soon move on to
other suspects.</TE>
<TE>   After learning of the Utah investigation in September, Orange
County prosecutors opened an investigation into Payne's handling of
the case. Payne was placed on paid administrative leave Oct. 4,
according to district attorney officials familiar with the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Payne's other cases, including one scheduled for jury trial three
days later, were assigned to other prosecutors in the office.</TE>
<TE>   Several prosecutors, judges and defense lawyers expressed surprise
at Payne's situation. They described him as a fair-minded but tough
prosecutor who has handled several high-profile child molestation
cases.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the best trial lawyer I've ever had in my court," said
Orange County Superior Court Judge Suzanne S. Shaw, who recently
presided over a case that Payne prosecuted. "He's prepared. He knows
the evidence inside and out. He doesn't have an agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy ought to be training other deputies in how to handle
cases," Shaw said. "This is amazing to me."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Payne prosecuted Boy Scout volunteer Kenneth Teague,
who was convicted of 16 felony molestation counts and sentenced to
more than 100 years in prison. In September, Payne filed charges
against a part-time vocal instructor for the All-American Boys Chorus
for allegedly molesting a teen-age boy for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas declined to comment for this story. Sources said
officials are examining several cases Payne handled, including the
Witbaard case.</TE>
<TE>   Witbaard's lawyer, Orange County Deputy Public Defender Doug
Lobato, said Payne handled the case responsibly and that the plea
bargain was fair, especially considering evidence problems the
prosecutor faced.</TE>
<TE>   Lobato noted that the charges did not involve significant sexual
contact -- Witbaard was alleged to have smacked the girls on the
bottom.</TE>
<TE>   A psychologist who interviewed Witbaard after he was charged with
assaulting the Buena Park girls found he was not likely to offend
again, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "My client is not a risk to anyone," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his arrest for the Buena Park assaults, Witbaard
was on probation for the sexual battery of a 40-year-old woman in
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Lobato said he believes Rackauckas took action against Payne in an
effort to protect his own image. The district attorney has appeared
on national talk shows to speak about the rash of child abduction
cases this year, notably that of Stanton 5-year-old Samantha Runnion,
who was molested and killed.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess there was a possibility of some bad publicity coming out
of this," Lobato said.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to a tip, Orange County probation officials arrested
Witbaard Sept. 12 for leaving California without authorization.
During a search of Witbaard's car, probation officers found a kitchen
knife, an ax and photographs of adult and preteen females in bathing
suits and underwear, according to an Orange County probation report.
He is being held in Orange County Jail without bail.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators vacuumed the car to collect potential evidence, such
as hair or clothing fibers. Utah investigators have sent the evidence
to a crime lab, where it is being evaluated, Lyman said.</TE>
<TE>   Lobato, Witbaard's attorney, said his client was homeless and that
he kept the knife and ax in his car to use while camping. He said
there's no evidence his client abducted Smart and that he does not
expect charges to be filed.</TE>
<TE>   The Utah investigation is continuing, even though a man
authorities initially considered a prime suspect in the case,
handyman Richard Ricci, died Aug. 30 while jailed on an alleged
parole violation.</TE>

<LD>Four people suffered minor wounds early Saturday at a fast-food
restaurant in what police called a gang-related shooting. Officers
shot and captured one of the attackers when he and two accomplices
tried to flee, Westminster police said.</LD>
<LD>   According to police, Westminster officers near Brookhurst Street
heard gunshots about 2:30 a.m. Police said four people at Alberto's
Mexican Food, whom they declined to identify, were wounded. When
officers arrived, they saw a dark Acura speeding away.</LD>
<LD>   The car turned onto McFadden Avenue, heading toward Santa Ana,
with police in pursuit. The chase ended at Ward Street when the car
struck a utility pole.</LD>
<TE>   Officers wounded and arrested one person after he fled the
vehicle. Two others escaped into a residential area.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they didn't know whether the wounded suspect had fired
at them or whether the other two suspects were hit by police bullets.
Officers said they recovered three handguns left behind by what they
said were Vietnamese American gang members.</TE>
<TE>   The four victims were taken to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital
and Medical Center and treated for minor wounds, police said. The
captured suspect was taken to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana,
where he was reported to be in critical but stable condition.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHONGQING, China</DL>
<LD>Yin Jiaxu is the model of free-market success in a land where market
was a dirty word until only a quarter of a century ago.</LD>
<LD>   The head of an auto maker here, Yin helped transform a floundering
state-owned enterprise into a thriving business. His company is
listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange; a new line of cars will roll
off the factory floor within weeks. Prospects have never seemed
brighter for Yin.</LD>
<LD>   From his corporate headquarters, it's a six-hour drive to where Gu
Xiuquan plows away at her job, which could hardly be less glamorous.
She runs a crossing signal on the Yangtze River, a monotonous,
government-provided post she has held for 19 years.</LD>
<TE>   But not for much longer. Next year, the massive Three Gorges Dam
is expected to flood her lonely outpost, washing away her job. "I
don't know what my colleagues and I will do after that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Their fortunes may run in opposite directions, but one thing
unites Yin and Gu: Both are card-carrying members of Communist Party
who will attend a crucial gathering this week in Beijing that could
shape the future of the world's most populous country.</TE>
<TE>   The 2,120 delegates to the 16th National Congress are the most
diverse in the party's 81-year history. They include businessmen like
Yin, who have benefited from China's development, and state employees
like Gu, who will suffer because of it. There are intellectuals like
Cao Zhenli, a Canadian-trained scientist, and rural cadres like Chang
Desheng, who went from collecting dog droppings for fertilizer as a
boy to becoming a local party boss.</TE>
<TE>   All four -- Yin, Gu, Cao and Chang -- are attending their first
national party conclave, an event held once every five years.</TE>
<TE>   The congress that opens Friday is significant because China's
ruling graybeards, such as President Jiang Zemin, 76, are expected to
make way for a new crop of leaders in what would be the most orderly
transfer of power in the history of the People's Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever succeeds Jiang at the helm of the Communist Party inherits
a 66-million-member organization in the grip of something of an
identity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The party has ruled China absolutely and often disastrously for
the last 53 years. But it is now struggling to stay relevant -- and
in power -- amid the profound changes sweeping the country. Two
decades of explosive economic growth have unleashed creative forces,
new ideas and limited social freedoms among China's 1.3 billion
people, who increasingly view the party as an anachronism, if not an
outright hindrance to progress.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang has made it his mission to haul the party abreast of the
times and to co-opt China's growing economic elites -- to the point
of inviting private business owners to join the party, a policy that
turns Communist orthodoxy on its head.</TE>
<TE>   This week's congress is expected to write Jiang's ideas into the
party charter, enshrining them alongside the theories of Marx and
Mao. Analysts say the party may even introduce a limited form of
internal democracy, although it would not extend to the rest of the
people, who still have no power to pick their leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Yin, Gu, Cao and Chang were chosen as delegates to the congress at
low-level gatherings this year. None will have a say in who takes
over the top spots in the hierarchy. None sits on the Central
Committee, which will set the party's agenda for the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   But their views and experiences point up how the world's largest
Communist Party has evolved from its origins as a ragtag band of
uneducated farmers and workers.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, the four delegates show themselves willing to come
to an accommodation with the party and its new brand of communism,
which some old revolutionaries think hardly merits the name. They
take a flexible, fuzzy or forget-about-it approach toward Marx but
embrace Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's market-oriented
economic reforms, who supposedly once declared that "to get rich is
glorious."</TE>
<TE>   For them, as for many Chinese, communism has ceased to be a grand
nationwide experiment or mass ideological movement. Instead, party
membership has become a personal, pragmatic matter: a way to get
ahead and enrich yourself or your hometown.</TE>
<TE>   "Society has changed," Chang said. "The party should follow the
trend and catch up."</TE>
<TE>   The Cadre</TE>
<TE>   Chang, 58, knows firsthand just how much the country has changed
and in how short a time.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the party as a young man, convinced that it was China's
best hope for ending the grinding poverty he experienced growing up
in Jiangsu province near Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   The third of five children, Chang helped his father dredge mud in
the river and picked through human waste at outdoor toilets for worms
to feed the family's pigs and ducks. His parents gave away one of his
sisters four times because they could not afford to keep her.</TE>
<TE>   "My strongest memory is of going hungry," he said. "My childhood
was all about being bullied, humiliated and famished."</TE>
<TE>   As a boy, Chang tagged along with his father to Communist Party
meetings and absorbed the idealism on display. "I got to know that
the goal of socialism is to give the poor a better life. I yearned
for a better life and had faith it would come one day."</TE>
<TE>   It did -- but not under Mao's disastrous policies of
collectivization and class struggle. Chang's entry into the party in
1966 coincided with the beginning of the 10-year reign of terror
known as the Cultural Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   For eight years he toiled as the head of the production brigade of
Jiangxiang village. It was only after the Cultural Revolution ended
and economic reforms began that Chang found a way to put his
creativity and junior high school education to use as Jiangxiang's
party secretary.</TE>
<TE>   He persuaded villagers to join him in starting a collective
enterprise manufacturing steel door and window frames and other
items.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Jiangxiang is a success story almost beyond imagination.
Chang's Jiangsu Changsheng Group Co. boasted $32 million in sales
last year. Residents watched their annual per capita income shoot up
from $163 in 1989 to $1,212 last year. And Jiangxiang has been
transformed from a poor backwater into a planned community -- tract
homes, schools and all -- that looks more like Irvine than a rural
Chinese village.</TE>
<TE>   Chang grows a tad embarrassed when asked if the fruits of his
labor resemble those of capitalism. He still credits the Communist
Party for his achievements.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the party's policy of reform and opening up, it would've
been impossible for me, a poor boy who collected garbage from the
Yangtze River 40 years ago, to have my achievements today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chang has no trouble allowing private entrepreneurs, who were once
condemned as "exploiters," into the fold. He is prepared to see that
written into the party charter at the congress.</TE>
<TE>   Economic development, he says, is the key. Old-fashioned notions
of the downtrodden masses, which the party still claims to champion,
are subordinate.</TE>
<TE>   "The party has changed greatly, just as the country has," he said.
"When I joined in the '60s, party members in the countryside were
mainly peasants. But there are all kinds of folks in the party now. I
think it's a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   The Worker</TE>
<TE>   Gu, the Yangtze River signal worker, agrees that the party needs
fresh faces and fresh ideas to stay in step with the modern world,
which China has gradually joined after decades of self-imposed
isolation.</TE>
<TE>   "Entrepreneurs and intellectuals are new blood," said Gu, 37.
"With them the party has more outstanding people to strive for its
great causes."</TE>
<TE>   But Gu is concerned about ensuring that, in the rush to embrace
the new forces in society, one of the party's original great causes
-- improving the lot of workers like her -- does not get cast aside.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, industrial and state workers were the privileged in
Chinese society, the "leading class" of the revolution that was
supposed to create an egalitarian utopia. The regime's "iron rice
bowl" policy guaranteed them housing, medical benefits, pensions and
high status.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of these laborers are now out of work, made redundant by
the demands of the market. Those once considered masters of the new
society now often work as servants in the newer society -- as
nannies, cooks and housekeepers -- when they can find jobs at all.
Keeping a lid on their disillusionment and anger has become one of
the regime's biggest headaches.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment will be a bitter reversal of fortune for Gu, who was
named a national model worker last year. A television miniseries is
being shot based on her life, an inspiring tale of how she overcame a
physical disability and little schooling to become a labor hero.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Gu traveled to Beijing to accept her award, her first
visit to the capital. In wonder, she toured places such as Tiananmen
Square that she had seen only on TV or in textbooks. This week, she
plans to return clear-eyed and determined to speak up.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of waterway workers will be laid off after the dam is built,
and most of them have worked here for generations. I have an
obligation to report their problems to the central party," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gu joined the party four years ago out of a sense of personal
ambition and development. Membership has its privileges: access to
connections, better chances at promotion.</TE>
<TE>   "The best way to get ahead is to join the party. That's why I
wanted to be a member," said Gu, who is among the small proportion --
only 18% -- of delegates to this year's congress who are women,
despite Mao's contention that "women hold up half the sky."</TE>
<TE>   She is also among the even tinier fraction who do not boast a
college education. A record 92% of this year's delegates have a
college degree -- another indication of the party's increasing
emphasis on China's elites.</TE>
<TE>   The Intellectual</TE>
<TE>   Cao, 43, not only holds a bachelor's degree but a master's and a
doctorate as well.</TE>
<TE>   That classifies him as one of China's intellectuals, a label that
seems to sit easily on a man who speaks fluent English and heads the
300-member Pulp and Paper Industry Research Institute in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Cao is the first to acknowledge that where he is today is due in
large part to an accident of birth. A native of Shandong province, he
was just the right age to take the national university entrance exam
in 1977, the year Deng reinstituted it after the Cultural Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   That allowed Cao to continue an education that had been
interrupted because of his "bad" class background: His grandmother
came from a land-holding family. Only the intervention of a dedicated
school principal got him back in school.</TE>
<TE>   The experience probably helps explain why Cao so firmly supports
throwing open the party's doors to people according to merit, not
background or profession.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what kind of work you do or where you work, as long as
you contribute to the common good, then you're part of the leading
class," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His training as a scientist, including a doctorate from the
University of Saskatchewan in Canada, has imbued Cao with a dose of
realism, which he applies to politics and the party. What matters, he
says, is results, not ideology.</TE>
<TE>   "What Marx wrote about was how to establish power. But once you're
in power, you have to use it to develop society, or else what's the
use?" Cao said. "The government's responsibility is to get everybody
rich. That's true of everywhere -- the U.S., Canada or China."</TE>
<TE>   For Cao, the benefits of development have been stark.</TE>
<TE>   When he left for college in 1977 in the southern city of
Guangzhou, he was able to wrap all his belongings in a single piece
of cloth, which he then slung over his shoulder like a hobo. A dozen
years later, he packed up again to continue his education in Canada.
His possessions filled two large suitcases.</TE>
<TE>   While he was overseas, China was seized by the tumult of the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre, in which hundreds of pro-democracy
protesters were killed by troops. Cao, who joined the party in 1987,
kept a watchful eye on his homeland as he pursued his studies. A 1992
speech by Deng, which helped jump-start a languishing economy,
persuaded Cao to return home.</TE>
<TE>   What he sees now is an increasingly but unevenly prosperous
country, a place of dismaying contrasts between rich and poor. The
party, as it sets its agenda for the next five years, must address
this widening disparity.</TE>
<TE>   The Beijing gathering must also push for the rule of law, Cao
said. But he stopped short of advocating Western-style political
reform.</TE>
<TE>   "The political structure isn't important," he said. "The ultimate
goal is the same, which is to help people prosper."</TE>
<TE>   The Businessman</TE>
<TE>   Prosperity for Yin has come in the form of a mammoth enterprise
called the Changan Automobile Group, based here in Chongqing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a venerable history stretching for more than a century,
the company was steadily losing market share until Yin took over as
general manager in 1998. Changan now boasts 23,000 employees and more
than $1 billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   The 46-year-old Yin is also Changan's party vice secretary. As a
state-owned enterprise, the company has a party hierarchy in addition
to its corporate structure, a messy, often confusing arrangement from
an outsider's perspective but one that allows the Communist regime to
keep a hand in company affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Yin sees no contradiction between his capitalist pursuits and
Communist ideals.</TE>
<TE>   "You can compare it to religion," he said. "In the U.S., a state
governor can be a Protestant or a follower of the Eastern Orthodox
Church, but it doesn't prevent him from being a governor. It's the
same way with my situation.... Being an entrepreneur is my work, my
vocation. Which party I join reflects my ideals and beliefs. There's
no conflict there."</TE>
<TE>   Yet what Yin describes as his ideals do not sound terribly
Communist. They come across more as a set of personal values -- hard
work, public service and self-improvement -- than a grand social
blueprint. And even those values get subjected to the demands of the
bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   The company has had to lay off hundreds of people during recent
years of retrenchment, although Yin says a good portion get retrained
and rehired. Benefits such as housing and health have been phased
out, replaced by pay hikes.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to develop your business first; only then can your
workers' wages rise," he said. "If the business is struggling, then
you have to tell your workers that they'll have to bite the bullet
and strive harder."</TE>
<TE>   The son of a poor coal miner, Yin credits the party with pulling
his father up from "the lowest level of society." Yin joined in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   But like Cao, he sees problems -- primarily official corruption,
which has spread like a cancer and created a credibility gap for the
party.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, as the head of a successful state-owned enterprise, Yin
belongs to a class that many Chinese assume profited dishonestly.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to bring up at the congress the dissatisfaction harbored
by so many ordinary people.</TE>
<TE>   "The party should stress ideological development and clean
government," Yin said. "These are the people's basic demands."</TE>

<HD>Mubarak Scion's Rise Fuels Talk of Successor</HD>
<DH>The 39-year-old businessman has developed a popular
following in Egypt, particularly among young professionals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Lamb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>With Egypt's leadership composed of men in their 60s and 70s whose
careers date from Gamal Abdel Nasser's era of pan-Arab socialism, the
political ascendancy of a reform-minded, 39-year-old businessman has
Cairo abuzz that the next president may now be serving his
apprenticeship.</LD>
<LD>   The speculation is particularly intriguing because the former Bank
of America executive is Gamal Mubarak, the younger son of President
Hosni Mubarak, 74, whose fourth six-year term expires in 2005 but who
has given no hint of his plans.</LD>
<LD>   A former air force commander, Mubarak took office in 1981 after
the assassination of Anwar Sadat and has never named a vice president
or groomed an heir.</LD>
<TE>   Both Mubaraks dismiss talk of succession, saying Egypt is neither
a monarchy nor a dynasty. Most Egyptians won't even discuss the issue
because conjecture about the first family is verboten here.</TE>
<TE>   Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a human rights advocate, believes that he
recently was sent to prison for seven years not because his think
tank received unapproved funds for election monitoring, as charged,
but because of his comments about succession, his friends say.</TE>
<TE>   "Succession is a red line Egyptians won't cross in conversation,"
said a Cairo academic, requesting anonymity. "But I think Gamal is
playing the game very well and I wouldn't be surprised to see him
take over. A lot of people say, why not? He couldn't be worse than an
army general or someone from the intelligence service."</TE>
<TE>   Affable and handsome, Gamal Mubarak has a master's degree from
American University in Cairo. He worked for Bank of America in Cairo
and London and later set up a private equity firm, MedInvest, which
has $100 million in assets. Keen not to be seen as abusing his status
as the president's son, he maintains a low profile and does not raise
funds for his firm, leaving that responsibility to a Cairo bank,
EFG-Hermes. The fund has put money into high-tech Egyptian companies.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Gamal Mubarak was pushed into the political
limelight at the general congress of the National Democratic Party,
Egypt's entrenched party that holds 388 of the 444 seats in
parliament and is generally considered rife with corruption,
patronage and old guard conservatism. In his newly created position
as secretary of policies, Mubarak in effect became responsible for
shaping the party's general policies at home and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak, who as a businessman works out of a modestly furnished
office in a nondescript concrete building north of Cairo, in
Heliopolis, caught the attention of Egyptians several years ago with
the founding of the Future Generation Foundation, an organization
focusing on housing, employment and other problems affecting the
young.</TE>
<TE>   He has also called for social and economic reform and the need for
increased democracy to bring young Egyptians into the decision-making
process. For a while he considered setting up an opposition party to
challenge the NDP.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't sense any immediacy to the succession issue because
President Mubarak can run for another term if he chooses," a Western
political analyst said. "Certainly Gamal is in position to be a
serious player, but I doubt President Mubarak has made a decision
yet. He's aware that no one here wants Egypt to be another Syria"
[where the constitution was amended in 2000 so Bashar Assad could
succeed his deceased father].</TE>
<TE>   Gamal Mubarak has developed a popular following, particularly
among young professionals, because of calls for long-overdue reforms.
With Egypt still in a state of emergency as a result of Sadat's
assassination 21 years ago, most people have grown tired of excessive
government controls, inadequate social services and a stagnant
economy unable to provide jobs for the 600,000 entering the workforce
every year.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt was particularly hard hit by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
on the United States, losing $1 billion in tourism and seeing a
decrease in Suez Canal transit fees and the weakening of the Egyptian
pound, the government says. The stock market has fallen 70%, and
unemployment tops 20%. Egypt has spent $7 billion, or one-third its
hard currency reserves, trying to shore up the pound over the last
three years.</TE>
<TE>   If the younger Mubarak, who has no military experience, does
indeed have presidential aspirations, he could face an obstacle with
the generals. They have no official role in politics but remain
politically influential.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt has twice seen smooth transfers of power from a president to
a vice president: to Sadat in 1970 when Nasser died of a heart
attack, and to Mubarak when Sadat was killed by Islamic extremists in
1981. Nasser, Sadat and Mubarak all came from the military ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 1971 constitution, if Mubarak were to die with no vice
president in place, the speaker of parliament would serve as interim
president. Within 60 days, parliament would hold an election, with a
two-thirds majority required to choose a president.</TE>

<HD>Kashmiris on the Hunt for the Elusive Tourist</HD>
<DH>Idyllic Himalayan valley loses its draw after 13 years of
secessionist violence. Businesspeople pounce on the few travelers who
come.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>Forget the snow leopard or ibex. Kashmir residents are looking for a
different endangered species these days: tourists.</LD>
<LD>   Once touted in brochures as "Heaven on Earth" and "Shangri-La,"
this idyllic valley in the Himalayan foothills has been racked by 13
years of bombings and secessionist violence.</LD>
<LD>   Toss in Kashmir's disputed status between nuclear powers India and
Pakistan, the hundreds of thousands of soldiers facing off on the two
nations' frontier and an ongoing rebel campaign to wrest control of
this portion of Kashmir from Indian rule and you have a pretty hard
sell for those in the travel promotion business.</LD>
<TE>   "Kashmir used to be a brand for paradise," said Mohammed Ashraf,
director general of tourism for India's Jammu and Kashmir state. "Now
it's a brand for trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Locals are so desperate for business that the few remaining
tourists are besieged.</TE>
<TE>   "Customers are like rare birds," said Ajaz Ahmad, a resident here
in Srinagar, the state's summer capital, whose house abuts several
lakeside souvenir shops. "So everyone rushes in to grab at their
golden eggs."</TE>
<TE>   Days pass without a sighting, said houseboat owner Nazir Dubloo.
Weeks slip by before he snags a tourist.</TE>
<TE>   Catching such elusive prey demands skill and cunning. Three Swiss
backpackers recently appeared only to be mobbed by hungry boat
owners. Dubloo, a longtime angler, held back and eventually earned
the foreigners' trust. "Sometimes to catch a fish, you need to be
very quiet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism once accounted for one in five jobs here in the Kashmir
Valley, as visitors flocked from elsewhere in India and abroad to
enjoy the cool summer air, luxuriate on houseboats and eat local
delicacies.</TE>
<TE>   After rebels went on the offensive in 1989, however, the exodus
was swift and merciless. Fewer than 20 visitors a day showed up in
1991, in contrast to the nearly 2,000 a day that flocked here the
previous year. And many of the shrinking pool of visitors were
journalists or relatives of residents.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the numbers have fluctuated, with about 30,000
visitors expected this year.</TE>
<TE>   At the airport, a faded sign reads "Visit Tourist Paradise" in and
among half a dozen checkpoints, sandbag barriers and tire traps.</TE>
<TE>   On beautiful Dal Lake, more than 1,000 houseboats nudge each other
in the calm waters. These famous floating hotels -- a legacy of 19th
century imperialism after Kashmir's maharajah refused to let the
British build summer homes on land -- boast balconies, Internet
access and names the likes of "New Cherry Ripe" and "Queen's Lap."</TE>
<TE>   With lakeside streetlamps casting a romantic glow as dusk
descends, however, few people other than the struggling owners are
around to enjoy the scenery.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all suffering, the government hasn't helped us a bit and we
can't pay our children's school fees," said Mohammed Amin Kawa, one
of several angry owners killing time at the group's lakeside hangout.
"What can we do, eat our houseboats?"</TE>
<TE>   Hariparbat Fort, once a must-see on the tourist trail, has become
a well-defended base for border police fighting insurgents, a
throwback to its 16th century origins. Cheshmashahi Garden is closed
to all but VIPs because of fears that its grounds might be used to
attack the nearby governor's mansion.</TE>
<TE>   A sign at the entrance to the Grand Plaza hotel -- once a
maharajah's palace and now an Intercontinental -- warns visitors to
leave their weapons at the door. Inside, its long empty hallways
evoke haunted hotel scenes in the 1980 horror classic "The Shining."</TE>
<TE>   Closer to town, the Broadway Hotel has switched clientele and now
specializes in war correspondents. Another two dozen hotels,
including the Bilwar and the Dok, are de facto barracks for police,
army, border and special operations forces amassed in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The number of taxi drivers has been cut in half as banks repossess
their chariots. "Having three or four cars blown up and our drivers
killed didn't help," said Abdul Majid, president of the Kashmir Taxi
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   For locals who lived through the boom years, it's all a waste.</TE>
<TE>   "If only Kashmir's problems can ever be solved, the tourists will
flood in once again," said motorized rickshaw driver Mohammed Ismael
Kaloo. "Our livelihood has been smashed from us. I feel we deserve to
get it back."</TE>
<TE>   In a classic case of bad timing, the Royal Springs golf course
recently staged its grand opening, 15 years after this "golfer's
dream" was envisioned. Since then, it has slashed greens fees and
waived membership rules, and there's never a wait.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials dream of a Tiger Woods visit to put the course on
the map. "We're told Tiger needs a minimum of $1 million to play
anywhere," said Ashraf, the tourism director. "Our argument is: We
have billion-dollar mountain views."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the course has worked to turn a liability into an
asset by hosting an all-India police tournament. "One thing there's
no shortage of around here is police and armed forces," said grounds
manager Nazhat Gul.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Ashraf is an eternal optimist. He has to be. He has
one of the toughest jobs in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent travel agent convention in New Delhi, a panel
discussed the 12-month setback British tourism was suffering from a
"mad-cow" scare before noticing Ashraf in the audience. "Look, he's
been promoting tourism in Kashmir for over 12 years," one panelist
said, "and he's still smiling."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping a sense of humor is important for someone who's been
called indefatigable, a fool, and everything in between. Ashraf
gently chides tourists for their timidity, the media for its
sensationalism and government travel warnings for their excessive
caution.</TE>
<TE>   That said, tourists deserve some slack -- given the 60,000 or so
people killed in Kashmir since 1989. Though most victims were locals,
rebels occasionally target foreigners, including six Western
backpackers kidnapped in 1995. One of them escaped, two others were
slain, and the rest are presumed dead.</TE>
<TE>   "Also, in the past year, several Western foreigners have been
attacked in an effort to ensure tourism does not get a new start in
these areas," the U.S. State Department says in its latest advisory.</TE>
<TE>   Ashraf counters that these advisories often are inconsistent.</TE>
<TE>   "Latin America probably has three or four kidnappings a day and a
coup a month, but you don't see the State Department warning against
visits to Brazil," he said. "The situation in Kashmir is not so bad."</TE>
<TE>   In a bid to bring the droves back, Ashraf wants Srinagar's
airfield upgraded to an international airport, is promoting the
region among Chinese and Arabs and over the Internet, and hands out
free trips so travel agents and writers can see Kashmir for
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no peaceful paradise anymore," he said, citing last
month's attack in Bali that killed more than 180 people. "Still, you
can't give up."</TE>
<TE>   Although security experts characterize Kashmir as a "long-term,
low-intensity conflict," these subtleties tend to be lost on those
intent on dominating a deck chair in the company of an umbrella
drink.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mighty Himalayas -- A Journey Into Faith" reads a dusty
1980s-era poster on a tourism office wall. Unfortunately, many are
taking the slogan literally.</TE>
<TE>   Marcel Mannetje, a 40-year-old Dutch computer programmer, and his
wife, Laila, are glad that they made the trip even as they keep their
eyes peeled.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole situation is so sad, this is such a beautiful place,"
Mannetje said, before adding: "Can I ask you a favor, though? We're
going trekking. If for some reason we don't return in 10 days, here's
the number of our agent."</TE>

<HD>'Muhammad' Movie Sets Out Religious Hurdles for Makers</HD>
<DH>Animated feature being shown in the Mideast is a
collaboration between a U.S. director and an Arab businessman, who
call it a 'bridge maker.'</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MUSCAT, Oman</DL>
<LD>As Ahmed bin Khalifan and his two sons hurried toward the Al Shatti
Plaza movie complex, he knew exactly what he wanted to see.</LD>
<LD>   Not "Bad Company" with Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins. "Too
vulgar, too American," said the 35-year-old plumbing contractor. And
not "K-19: The Widowmaker," with Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson. "The
reviews were bad," he said.</LD>
<LD>   The Khalifans, arriving in a late-model Lexus, were headed for the
animated feature "Muhammad: The Last Prophet," which is attracting
respectable, if not blockbuster, audiences throughout the Middle East
since opening Oct. 16.</LD>
<TE>   "This is family entertainment," said Khalifan with a nod as his
sons, ages 9 and 11, headed for the snack bar.</TE>
<TE>   That the 90-minute movie was even made is a testament to the
collaboration between a former Disney animation director and a Middle
Eastern businessman eager to break into the movie business.</TE>
<TE>   "When we began, people were very skeptical but I knew there would
be an audience if we did things right," said Muwaffak Harithy, whose
other credits include working in his family's construction,
maintenance, real estate and portfolio management interests.</TE>
<TE>   "This movie is a bridge maker, a way to show Islam the way it
truly is," said Harithy, chairman of Syria-based Badr Intl. "The
journey has been the reward."</TE>
<TE>   A half-dozen years and upward of $10 million in the making, the
film had to fight objections by Islamic clerics concerned about how
their holy story of Muhammad and the Koran would be handled by a
moviemaking technique associated with Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny.</TE>
<TE>   For openers, director and producer Richard Rich -- selected by
Harithy because of his animation experience and track record of
successful religious films -- faced an obstacle that few moviemakers
encounter: His hero could not appear on screen.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic law considers it a sin to display images of Muhammad, the
7th century prophet who spoke out against corrupt political and
military leaders in Mecca, was driven into exile, and later led a
battle to liberate the holy city from nonbelievers.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew from day one that our main character could not be seen
and could not be heard," Rich said. "Our goal was to be true to
Islam, not to give our version or interpretation of it."</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad is symbolized by blinding light. His words are never
heard, but his message is relayed by a loyal follower who is
persecuted.</TE>
<TE>   Rich and other employees of his Rich-Crest Animation in Burbank
videotaped themselves acting each scene. The tape would then be sent
over the Internet to animators in South Korea, a process known as
"smacking." Nearly 196,000 drawings were needed before "Muhammad" was
finished.</TE>
<TE>   The ghost of the 1976 "The Message," another biopic of the
prophet, starring Anthony Quinn (as Muhammad's uncle, Hamza) hung
over the production. The Quinn movie drew protests from Islamic
fundamentalists incensed over a rumor that Charlton Heston or Peter
O'Toole would play Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   The Moroccan government withdrew permission for filming, and the
company took refuge in Libya under the sponsorship of Moammar Kadafi,
which only increased the controversy. The effort was a financial
flop.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid the same fate, "Muhammad: The Last Prophet" omitted not
just the prophet but also his uncle.</TE>
<TE>   And the film was submitted to Shiite clerics in Lebanon and
scholars at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, the most respected
theological center in the Sunni Muslim world. With minor changes,
both gave their stamp of approval.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the chief censor in Egypt, invited to a sneak preview, was
incensed at scenes showing Muslims smashing idols that looked like
Pharaonic statues. The scenes were cut, and the movie opened as
scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   In Oman, a traditional Islamic society where Western influence is
not as apparent as in more tourist-dependent Persian Gulf countries,
"Muhammad" was approved by the state censor without a hitch. The Al
Shatti Plaza complex is part of an outdoor mall popular with the
middle and upper-middle classes.</TE>
<TE>   Rich worked 14 years in the Disney animation department before
leaving in the mid-1980s to start his own company.</TE>
<TE>   At Disney, he directed "The Fox and the Hound" and "The Black
Cauldron." For his own firm, he has directed "The Swan Princess,"
"The King and I," and "The Trumpet of the Swan," as well as more than
50 videos from stories taken from scriptures and world history,
including the "Animated Heroes Series" that aired on HBO.</TE>
<TE>   For "Muhammad," Rich wanted an epic feel, something that "captures
the moment."</TE>
<TE>   The colors are vivid, the movement lifelike and captivating, and
even a viewer who doesn't speak Arabic is drawn into the drama of the
battle for Mecca. Composer William Kidd, a Hollywood veteran, did the
musical score.</TE>
<TE>   Initial plans were for "Muhammad" to be shown in the U.S. with
English subtitles.</TE>
<TE>   Movie publicist Don Barrett pitched distributors with the idea
that, more than ever, the U.S. needs a movie that can help Americans
understand the founding of Islam. The reaction, he said, was not
encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   "9/11 has complicated the problem [of getting the movie shown] in
the U.S.," Barrett said.</TE>
<TE>   In Oman, and eight other countries in the region, there is no such
problem. The audience this night included families, younger teenagers
and even a German couple on holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "Now my sons will have more respect for Muhammad the prophet
because he has his own movie," explained Khalifan as he left the
theater.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Readying Its Bridges for River in Iraq</HD>
<DH>The Pentagon is pre-positioning equipment so troops could
transit the Euphrates in any effort to topple Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Esther Schrader</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon is outfitting Army engineering units with
state-of-the-art river-crossing equipment capable of moving large
numbers of troops and heavy materiel across the Euphrates quickly if
the decision is made to attack Iraq, current and former defense
officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The portable bridges -- carried on truck beds in retractable
sections that snap out into flat spans when they hit the water -- are
being delivered to some of the dozen or so units at U.S. and European
bases that might deploy to the Persian Gulf in the event of war.</LD>
<LD>   Any U.S. military drive to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
from power probably would require not just airstrikes but also a
full-scale ground attack.</LD>
<TE>   Military officials say it would be impossible to control Iraq
without crossing the broad Euphrates, which flows the length of the
country and passes near Baghdad. The rapidly deployed bridges could
play a crucial role, minimizing U.S. casualties by speeding large
numbers of soldiers and heavy equipment across the river.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how U.S. troops were to advance across Iraq, they would
face the task of bridging and controlling the strategic waterway.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, there will have to be equipment moved
across the Euphrates, because if you want to control Iraq, you have
to have forces on both sides of that river," said retired Lt. Gen.
James Terry Scott, former commander of the Army's Special Operations
Command. "And it will have to be over something that we can
construct, because Iraq just doesn't have big enough existing bridges
to move that kind of heavy equipment. And if it does, Saddam Hussein
is going to make sure they get blown up."</TE>
<TE>   Units that specialize in the muddy, difficult work of a major
river crossing recently have stepped up training. In September, the
Army's armor-heavy 1st Cavalry Division, based at Ft. Hood, Texas,
conducted a huge exercise to practice the procedure. Military
officials say the unit most likely would be the first deployed in any
invasion of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Other units are following suit, honing their skills at a task that
was considered an important capability in Cold War days, when the
military needed to be ready to cross the many rivers of Europe with
ease.</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of the Cold War, the focus of U.S. military
operations has shifted from Europe to areas of the globe with fewer
broad rivers, and the technique of fighting has shifted from the
deployment of massive ground forces to heavy reliance on air power,
making river crossing less important.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1991 Persian Gulf War, U.S. forces had no need to cross the
Euphrates because their goal was simply to expel Iraq from occupied
Kuwait. This time, however, the stated aim is ousting Hussein from
power and changing the Iraqi regime -- a task likely to require entry
into Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Military history is replete with tales of crucial and treacherous
river operations, from Washington crossing the Delaware to the U.S.
3rd Army's rush over the Rhine in 1945, but American forces have not
faced enemy fire while crossing a major river with a large force in
five decades.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, Iraq has a half-mile-wide moat that the American
Army is going to have to get across," said John Pike, director of
GlobalSecurity.org, a military research firm. "If there's one place
that the Republican Guard might counterattack, that would be it."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the U.S. military were to face no enemy at the banks of
the Euphrates, it would have a complex logistical challenge on its
hands.</TE>
<TE>   The last time U.S. ground forces crossed a major river under
conditions that might have led to combat was in Bosnia-Herzegovina in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   That crossing of the Sava River was unopposed. But it was severely
complicated by the worst flooding on the river in 70 years, at the
height of the harsh Balkan winter. Few commanders involved had
executed a major river operation, even in training, said retired Army
Maj. Gen. William Nash, who commanded U.S. ground forces in Bosnia at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, U.S. forces were so confident about the operation that
they ferried troops and equipment across in helicopters and rafts
long before the bridge was completed. After almost a week of
attempts, Army engineering brigades built a 373-foot one-lane span in
72 hours. During the next few weeks, it was expanded to allow two-way
traffic; 20,000 vehicles, many of them heavy fuel tankers and
artillery pieces, crossed over it safely.</TE>
<TE>   The last time U.S. forces faced an enemy while crossing a river of
any size was during the 1950-53 Korean War, at the Han River. In
World War II, the 3rd Army under Gen. George S. Patton Jr. used some
of the techniques still employed today to cross the Rhine.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike the situation that faced Washington crossing the Delaware,
Robert E. Lee and Patton, for that matter, we've got a capacity
today, with our air and mobile capacities, that allows us to jump
that river with a lot less vulnerability to the forces doing the
crossing," Nash said. "But you've still got to move a lot of things
across that river that can't fly."</TE>
<TE>   Military planners at the Pentagon are analyzing a broad range of
options for an invasion of Iraq, but all call for advancing
significant ground forces deep into the country and for crossing the
wide, slow-moving expanse of the Euphrates to take control of nearby
Baghdad, defense officials said. Several plans also call for crossing
the Tigris, the other major river that slices across Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the contingencies that has to be addressed, and
that planners are addressing," said a defense official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. "It's pretty simple. If what we need to do is
on the other side, we have to cross that river."</TE>
<TE>   Getting an armored force, even a relatively light force, across a
river is anything but simple. Although every ground unit is trained
and outfitted to get troops and equipment across small rivers, creeks
and gaps, crossing a major river is a different challenge altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Although many aspects of waging war have gotten easier with the
advent of modern technology, crossing a river has in some respects
become harder, because a modern army has so much equipment to move.</TE>
<TE>   And although technology has made it possible for the modern army
to protect crossers with air power as it unfurls bridges off the
backs of trucks, the fundamentals of attacking an enemy across a
river have not changed since ancient times, when the Persian army
built bridges in the 5th century BC during its invasion of Greece,
and ancient Macedonia, a century later, first used professional
engineers to speed a river crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Any U.S. ground force driving to Baghdad would number 2,000
vehicles at a bare minimum, according to former military officials
with experience in such crossings.</TE>
<TE>   Before a bridge could be constructed, ground forces would have to
get the structure and the necessary heavy equipment -- including
rafts and small boats -- to the river. Once there, warplanes and
combat helicopters would protect the bridge-building operation.
Troops and light equipment would be ferried across the river on
helicopters and rafts to secure the other side.</TE>
<TE>   Although military planners think it unlikely that Hussein's army
would be capable of mounting any significant opposition at the banks
of the Euphrates or the Tigris, the Iraqis could do some mischief,
the planners say.</TE>
<TE>   If the Army slowed while crossing the river, that could give the
enemy a chance to lob artillery shells at the Americans. Iraqi combat
engineers, considered among their nation's most competent soldiers,
also could dynamite standing bridges over the Euphrates, making
crossing with even light ground forces significantly more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   If Hussein chose to launch a chemical or biological attack against
invading U.S. forces, the banks of the Euphrates could give him the
chance to do so while the American military had a large number of
troops and equipment in one place. There are also major dams along
both the Tigris and the Euphrates that the Iraqis could open to swell
the rivers.</TE>
<TE>   During the past decade, the U.S. Army has reduced the number of
units trained to cross major rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, there are six such units at the division level,
according to Russell Glenn, a senior defense analyst at Rand, a Santa
Monica-based think tank, who as an Army officer commanded an infantry
division's bridge company in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The bridge units are attached to mechanized and armored divisions.
Two are based at Ft. Hood and one at Ft. Stewart in Georgia. Two more
are based in Germany and another in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The Army also has reserve units trained to get personnel and
equipment across rivers and already has positioned in the Gulf region
some of the bridges, trucks and other heavy equipment that would be
needed for crossing the Euphrates.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the divisions will finish regularly scheduled training by
the end of this year that would ready them for an assault on Iraq in
January or February.</TE>
<TE>   The new bridge being deployed to the units, the Improved Float
Bridge (Ribbon Bridge), is carried on a modified Army truck chassis.
The Pentagon began deploying the equipment in June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The bridge, produced by a German company, is a significant
improvement over earlier ribbon bridges, according to Glenn. Copied
in Cold War days from satellite photos of Soviet ribbon bridges, plus
one captured by the Israelis from the Egyptians, it is made up of
several sections. Some of the sections have ramps and supports to
secure the structure against steep riverbanks; others are designed to
attach to the end sections and float on pontoons in the middle of a
river.</TE>
<TE>   At the touch of a series of controls, the bridge sections slide
off the back of the truck and flatten out as they hit the water. When
they are deployed, tug-like boats -- also brought to the banks of a
river on trucks -- push the sections together. Soldiers then secure
them to each other.</TE>
<TE>   The new bridge supports more weight than earlier versions and can
be secured to steeper riverbanks. The bridge also stays more stable
in faster currents than earlier models. With modern military mobile
artillery pieces weighing in at as much as 140,000 pounds, such
improvements become critical, according to military analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "River crossings are technically difficult feats of amazing
technology and skill," Glenn said. "To get vast amounts of heavy
equipment across a major river, you can't bring it in by air; you
have to worry about currents, muddy banks, steepness of the banks,
depth of the water. It's never been easy."</TE>

<HD>World Shrinking for Wary Travelers</HD>
<DH>Americans are staying away from many vacation destinations
while foreign tourists balk at coming to the United States.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. Michael Kennedy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Heath had worked for months on the surprise birthday trip for
his wife, Colleen. He secretly bought plane tickets and reserved a
hotel. He even conspired with his wife's boss to arrange vacation
time behind her back.</LD>
<LD>   The dream destination: Bali. But not anymore.</LD>
<LD>   In the aftermath of the nightclub bombing that killed nearly 200
people last month, Heath and his wife opted for an out-of-the way
Mexican Pacific resort in Barra de Navidad rather than the South
Pacific.</LD>
<TE>   "As soon as I saw the news reports I knew there was no way I was
going to bring my wife there," said Heath, of Monrovia. "I wasn't
going to be looking over my shoulder all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Their story is becoming increasingly common. Americans who see
themselves as targets are staying away from foreign vacation
destinations in droves as the once-expansive world of travel shrinks
with each new threat and violent incident.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-seven countries are listed by the State Department as
places where American travelers should use extreme caution or avoid
altogether, apparently a record number. Of those, 24 have a travel
warning, which means "stay away." "The sense is that we have many
more now than we ever did," State Department spokesman Stuart Pratt
said of the warnings.</TE>
<TE>   That may bode ill for the adventurous American tourist. Americans
began traveling abroad in large numbers with the introduction of
transoceanic jet travel in 1958. With a few exceptions, those numbers
continued to climb through the next three decades.</TE>
<TE>   The last major downturn in travel to foreign destinations came
during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when Americans hunkered down to see
what would happen in the battle to free Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.
Even the number of Americans visiting comparatively safe Europe
dropped by more than 1 million in 1991, a 16% decrease from the
previous year. Since then, however, the number of Americans traveling
abroad had risen dramatically -- until 2001, when they again stayed
home.</TE>
<TE>   Travel experts say that in the event of a Middle East war,
Americans will seek out familiar places like Europe for vacations, or
will simply stay close to home. Recreational-vehicle sales and
rentals, for instance, are booming. The bed-and-breakfast business is
up, and so are visits to national parks.</TE>
<TE>   "Any place with an Indiana Jones kind of atmosphere can forget
it," said John Valerio, owner of Crown City Travel in Pasadena. "If
it has a smidgen of intrigue, people aren't going to go there."</TE>
<TE>   Not Even on the List</TE>
<TE>   And that includes places not even on the warning list. Valerio's
bookings to Turkey are way off. Ditto for Eastern Europe. Suddenly, a
trip north to Canada is starting to look more appealing than a
biblical pilgrimage to Israel, which has been racked by terrorist
attacks and other fighting. Tourism is up 5% in Canada while it has
dropped 70% in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "No one's coming," said Hani abu Dayyeh, a Jerusalem-based tour
operator whose family has been involved in the Middle East travel
industry for many years. "It's a big mess."</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Abu Dayyeh's company had to sell several
hotels and about half its bus fleet just to stay afloat. The staff at
his Jerusalem office has dwindled from 22 to three. He said that the
American tourist presence is almost nil and that it has been that way
for two years. The culprit is not only West Bank violence but also
suicide bombings throughout Israel that have made cafes and buses
common targets.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Eckert, whose Adventure Woman tour company caters to women
30 and older, said she had to plan her 2003 trips carefully to avoid
places that are potential trouble spots. This year she canceled trips
to both India and Nepal because of unstable conditions there.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to go anywhere near places where there have been
problems," said Eckert, who runs her company out of Bozeman, Mont.
"We used to go places where we can't go anymore." She cited Rwanda
and Zimbabwe, among others, where she no longer takes her tours.</TE>
<TE>   Even Europe, though, may not be free of anti-American sentiment.
Richard Dekmejian, a USC political science professor, said Europeans
are becoming increasingly dismayed with the bellicose threats of war
against Iraq by the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The stuff coming out of the State Department is having such a
negative resonance right across Europe," he said. "Our friends in
Europe and the non-Islamic world are aghast."</TE>
<TE>   Another industry that has been forced to make changes is the
cruise-line business, particularly those that offered
around-the-world packages.</TE>
<TE>   "World cruises are struggling," said Mike Driscoll, editor of
Cruise Week, a trade publication. "These are cruises that often have
40 stops. But it's hard to find 40 countries that aren't near a
worrisome area."</TE>
<TE>   He also said cruise lines are operating out of more American
ports, allowing vacationers to drive to a ship and avoid a flight.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Palmer, head of the Student and Youth Assn. of North
America -- a Detroit-based trade group that specializes in student
travel -- said some school boards are balking at allowing travel
abroad. He said restrictions on youth group travel are driven by
liability and safety issues, despite the fact that the most popular
destinations are Western Europe and Japan. But he said he expected
the number of young people traveling abroad to increase, despite the
impression that the world is a more dangerous place.</TE>
<TE>   "Younger people always tend to take more risks than older people,"
he said. "This particular age group is pretty sharp in looking at
problems and finding solutions."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Seen as Dangerous</TE>
<TE>   Palmer also noted that foreigners who are balking at coming to the
United States because it is now considered too dangerous make up the
biggest falloff in international travel. At an international youth
conference in Toronto this year, less than half the students showed
up. The reason most often given: It was too close to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   International travel to the United States fell by 11% in 2001 and
is going to stay in the dumper this year as well, according to the
Travel Industry Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   A Canadian government advisory, for instance, warns of possible
further attacks in the United States, with targets including
airports, apartment buildings, popular landmarks, bridges, nuclear
power plants, and oil and gas refineries, as well as the danger of
more airplane hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   The Australian government warns its citizens "to be especially
alert to their own security" in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Epstein of the Massachusetts-based Odysseys Unlimited
touring company said people he talks to abroad are less likely now to
travel to the U.S. than they were before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, the U.S. had to be considered one of the safest possible
destinations in the world," he said. "Now people give it a second and
third thought."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that fewer people are traveling has left the American
travel industry in a serious funk that isn't expected to rebound for
at least a couple more years.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic and international travel expenditures dropped by $33.3
billion in 2001 and are expected to decline by an additional $1.9
billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   At a tourism forum last month, Delos Smith, a senior analyst with
the nonprofit Conference Board, which produces the Consumer
Confidence Index, warned that war with Iraq could make international
travel an even harder sell.</TE>
<TE>   "For this industry, war clouds are the worst thing you can have,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a silver lining in all this for some. Christine
Gustafson of the California Assn. of Bed and Breakfast Inns, said
business is booming around the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to think of escaping to someplace exotic," she said. "But
now that just makes people anxious."</TE>

<HD>Electorate in Turkey Has Overriding Goal -- Change</HD>
<DH>Vote today is expected to bring a housecleaning of the
government. But the leading party's Islamic roots trouble many,
especially the military.</DH>

<LD>ANKARA, Turkey -- Omer Kaptan was a farmer. But fertilizer prices
climbed too high, so he left his land and moved to the city, where he
sold pots and pans on the streets until the economy collapsed last
year and workers from peddlers to bankers lost their jobs.</LD>
<LD>   These days, Kaptan strolls a poor neighborhood of illegal shanties
hammered into a hillside here on the outskirts of Turkey's capital.
There are wilting cabbage piles and chimney smoke and women knitting
in the sun. Cats and children pick through garbage. And a man rants
in the road -- his neighbors shaking their heads -- because he has no
way to feed his family.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no work in this country. We're finished," said the
55-year-old Kaptan, a sturdy man with a graying beard. "The number of
coffee shops increased because of all the unemployed. They sit with
nothing to do. Husbands and wives are quarreling. Even at my age, I
am quarreling with my wife.</LD>
<TE>   "Look," he said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out the
equivalent of 60 cents. "This is all I have for my 10 children."</TE>
<TE>   Disillusionment and anger are expected to sweep the current
government from power in Sunday's national elections. Turks want new
faces to staunch the worst economic crisis since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the polls is the Justice and Development Party, or AKP,
whose populist appeal and Islamic roots are a troubling sign for
many, especially the military, that Turkey's deeply avowed secularism
is under threat.</TE>
<TE>   The AKP bills itself as a westward-leaning party with a commitment
to democratic principles. It has captured 30% support in recent
surveys and leads a field of 18 parties. Running second with nearly
20% in the polls is the Republican People's Party, or CHP, with its
charismatic economic reformer, Kemal Dervis. Many analysts predict
that the AKP and CHP will enter a coalition government. Such a
scenario would please the military, which views the latter as an
ideal counterbalance to Islamic influence.</TE>
<TE>   But nearly a third of voters polled have said they are undecided,
making it difficult to predict what influence the rising popularity
of radical groups such as the Young Party, which is promising free
education and free land, will have on the outcome. Young Party leader
Cem Uzan, whose family owns the nation's second-largest mobile phone
company, is facing racketeering changes in the U.S. for allegedly
defaulting on nearly $3 billion in loans from Nokia and Motorola.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't made up my mind yet. We don't trust any of these guys,"
said Hatice Kucuk, sitting with other women in Kaptan's shantytown.
"They're all the same."</TE>
<TE>   One thing is clear: Turks want to purge their government of old
coalitions and the political corruption that has infected this nation
of more than 65 million for decades. While many voting for the AKP
are choosing it for religious reasons, most Turks just want something
different. The AKP logo of a light bulb and its feisty leader, Recep
Tayyip Erdogan, have capitalized on the desire for change, even if
the party has been vague on prescriptions for reducing a $200-billion
national debt and leading the country toward its long cherished dream
of entering the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   The military is watching closely. The protector of secularism in a
country that's 97% Muslim, the military forced an Islamic party from
power in 1997. Since modern Turkey's founding by Kemal Ataturk in
1923, the military and special police, often accused of human rights
abuses, have been battling Islamists for the nation's soul. Erdogan,
the former mayor of Istanbul, was jailed several years ago for
reciting a poem that read, "Minarets are our bayonets.... Mosques are
our barracks."</TE>
<TE>   But the ruined economy -- with an unofficial 20% unemployment rate
and $16 billion in loans from the West -- is proving a more immediate
threat. The national intelligence service recently urged television
stations to limit the airing of celebrity magazine shows featuring
wealth and baubles. The government said such programs were "causing
deep reactions among the masses who are in economic crisis."</TE>
<TE>   When asked how much money she earned for a fashion shoot, a model
replied: "If I told you, there'd be a social implosion."</TE>
<TE>   The nation's economic woes are propelling the AKP in the polls.
Discontent is so strong that Prime Minster Bulent Ecevit's Party of
the Democratic Left is not expected to win 10% of the vote, the
minimum required to hold seats in parliament.</TE>
<TE>   "If the AKP comes to power," Kaptan said, "Turkey will enter the
European Union and I'll be able to go to Europe and find a job."</TE>
<TE>   Most political analysts don't regard this election as the
watershed Turkey needs to overhaul a history of government
inefficiency, patronage and strong military influence. No party or
politician is seen as possessing the skills to clean up the
bureaucracy, stop torture and human rights abuses in the ethnic
Kurdish southeast, and quickly lift Turkey into the fold of the West.
But an AKP victory, according to politicians and analysts, could
trigger the beginning of social change and more emphasis on
democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "This election is not only driven by anger and dissent," said Dogu
Ergil, director of the Center for Research on Societal Problems.
"It's about a search for a new social contract that will allow
religious and other groups more breathing space.... The AKP's
challenge will be to contain its radicals and religious extremists.
They must suppress this, or it could threaten the party and the
government."</TE>
<TE>   The party's officials acknowledge that they must tread gingerly,
especially with regard to issues such as the ban on wearing Islamic
head scarves in public buildings. The debate has roiled for years and
has domestic and international ramifications for a nation that
straddles East and West.</TE>
<TE>   Lifting the head-scarf ban could be considered a welcome step
toward more democratic freedoms. But it also could be interpreted as
an Islamic victory at a time when a wary Europe is considering Turkey
for EU membership and the U.S. is lining up allies for a possible war
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Turkey's a democratic country. There's some question marks about
that, but we are," said Reha Denemec, one of the AKP's founding
members. "We don't think of the head scarf in terms of religious
elements. It's a human rights question. Seventy-six percent of Turks
want to solve the head-scarf issue."</TE>
<TE>   Bilge Dogan is one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Shopping the other day outside the Haci Bayram Mosque, Dogan, with
only her hands and face visible, stopped near a vendor selling prayer
beads.</TE>
<TE>   "The AKP will bring me freedom to wear my head scarf," she said.
"I haven't been able to study at university for six years because
they banned the head scarf. I would have liked to have been an
engineer."</TE>
<TE>   Such talk worries Turks like Husayin Alakus, an unemployed truck
driver with three children.</TE>
<TE>   "The AKP is going to turn Turkey into Iran," said Alakus, who is
voting for the Young Party. "Why should we let them do that?"</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's leading Jewish industrialist, Ishak Alaton, said he
doesn't believe the AKP wants to create an Islamic state.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have a grandiose project to change the basic elements
of society," he said. "They have proof of what they'll risk....
Tayyip Erdogan has been trying to give the right messages to certain
forces, including the Jewish lobby."</TE>
<TE>   Despite being the party's energetic touchstone, Erdogan most
likely would not have a place in an AKP government. His 1998
conviction on religious sedition has banned him from parliament and
from serving as prime minister. Federal prosecutors are attempting to
have him removed as party chairman.</TE>
<TE>   The AKP was formed in 2001 when the Islamic Virtue Party split
over disagreements between moderates and religious hard-liners.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan, who in the mid-1990s opposed Turkey's entry into the EU,
brought together young, Western-educated professionals to widen the
AKP's appeal to secularists and to the U.S. and Europe, both crucial
for improving Turkey's economy and stock market.</TE>
<TE>   The last Islamic party to come to power was the Welfare Party. The
military forced its collapse in 1997 because of fears that it was
steering Turkey toward the Middle East instead of Europe.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Learned to Play Along</HD>
<DH>During the four-year antitrust suit, the software giant got
smarter about politics and polished its approach in court.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court last year unanimously declared Microsoft
Corp. a monopolist that abused its market power to hobble
competitors. Yet when it came time last week to punish the world's
most valuable company, Microsoft escaped devastating sanctions.</LD>
<LD>   The reasons are many. The Redmond, Wash.-based software maker got
smarter about how to play Washington, D.C., politics. Its opponents
dwindled and misplayed some of the few cards they had left. And
Microsoft just plain got lucky.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly on Friday approved a
settlement to end the four-year antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft
without imposing many of the tough restrictions sought by California
and eight other states. The Justice Department and Microsoft hailed
the ruling as good for technology and good for consumers, but critics
disagreed on both counts.</LD>
<TE>   The most important factor in avoiding stiff sanctions may have
been Microsoft's adaptable corporate culture, cultivated by its
co-founder, Bill Gates. Gates' company dramatically improves weak
initial versions of its software until it gets them right. In much
the same way, Microsoft eventually learned how to grease the right
Washington wheels and come across more reasonably in court. Then it
benefited from mistakes by the states and from events beyond the
control of either side -- especially the 2000 election of George W.
Bush as president.</TE>
<TE>   "The conventional wisdom is that regime change in Washington is
what caused all this, and certainly a regime change was a substantial
proximate cause. But it was not the only cause," said Silicon Valley
lawyer Gary Reback, who helped design the government's initial legal
assault at the behest of such Microsoft rivals as Sun Microsystems
Inc. and Oracle Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department and 19 states sued Microsoft in 1998, but
that effort "lost its start-up quality" over time, Reback said
Saturday. The states' agendas fractured and money and enthusiasm ran
short.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Friday's opinion by Kollar-Kotelly offers insight into how,
even in its late stages, the campaign against Microsoft could have
ended differently.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the case, Microsoft hewed to the same sort of
scorched-earth approach in the courtroom its rivals accused it of
taking in business. Gates personally oversaw the strategy that
exploited inherent weaknesses in the legal system.</TE>
<TE>   Any judicial proceeding of such magnitude takes years to
prosecute, especially against such a well-heeled opponent. Antitrust
law in particular is complex, turning on arcane economic theories and
statistics. And technology advanced even as the case proceeded. For
instance, by the time the case reached the appeals court, Microsoft
already had taken the lead in the Internet browser market from
onetime leader Netscape Communications Corp., which has since been
acquired by AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're always seeking a remedy after the fact, you're never
going to fix these markets," said Reback, explaining that a
punishment can fit an old crime without preventing a new one. "If you
come in and say 'don't do it again,' he says 'fine' -- he has the
benefit of the illegal conduct."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Microsoft began bundling its browser, Internet Explorer,
free with every copy of Windows, which powers more than 90% of the
world's PCs. Its competitors cried foul.</TE>
<TE>   After months of lobbying, the competitors forced a reluctant U.S.
Justice Department to argue that Microsoft was violating a 1994
consent decree. But the company prevailed on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1998, a separate suit by the Clinton administration and 19
states revisited the issues. The Justice Department hired star
litigator David Boies and spent more than $7 million accusing
Microsoft of illegally maintaining its desktop monopoly by quashing a
combined threat by Netscape and Sun's Java programming language. Java
and Netscape enabled programmers to write software less dependent on
Windows.</TE>
<TE>   A key second accusation was that Microsoft was breaking the law by
trying to extend its monopoly into the browser market.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft fought every point in court. But it also made changes to
the way it approached Washington. Like many technology companies, it
had all but ignored the political process.</TE>
<TE>   A Big Corporate Donor</TE>
<TE>   But it began funneling millions to a range of candidates, favoring
Republicans as they grew in strength. By the time of the 2000
Republican national convention, as the litigation was entering a
crucial phase, Microsoft was the second-largest corporate donor,
giving $4.3 million to the two parties -- a far cry from the $256,000
it gave in 1996. Just over half went to Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   On the campaign trail, then-candidate Bush said he was worried the
company would be broken up, which he said was the "great fear" in the
case. In June 2000, about four months before the election, U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered Microsoft broken
apart. Microsoft appealed.</TE>
<TE>   After the election, the Bush administration's new antitrust
enforcer, Charles James, showed less enthusiasm for the Microsoft
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   When the federal appeals court overturned Jackson's breakup order
in 2001, James got a chance to change course. The judges said Jackson
had not done enough to consider the effect of a split. And the
appeals court removed Jackson from the case for speaking with
reporters while the case was pending, another unpredictable event in
Microsoft's favor.</TE>
<TE>   On Jackson's findings, the appeals court said the government had
proved that Microsoft acted improperly in protecting its monopoly,
but not that it improperly went after the browser market by tying
Internet Explorer to Windows. James announced that the U.S. wouldn't
seek a breakup or a retrial on the issue of tying.</TE>
<TE>   The states, which had taken a back seat to the Justice Department,
had almost no notice that federal officials were backing off.
Eventually they decided to follow -- a step some lawyers on both
sides now see as a mistake because it limited the states' options and
surrendered the momentum.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as Kollar-Kotelly took control, meeting the two sides just
weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, any remaining enthusiasm
among the states took another hit. Citing the terrorist attacks, she
said the country had more important things to worry about.</TE>
<TE>   "That changed the emotional feeling around the case," said Jim
Tierney, a onetime Maine attorney general with ties to Oracle who
lobbied the attorneys general to stand firm.</TE>
<TE>   As the states' lawyers looked at each other in amazement,
Kollar-Kotelly urged Microsoft and the government to settle their
differences. "I expect [both sides] to make all efforts, seven days a
week, around the clock," she said.</TE>
<TE>   James did just that, emerging with a mediated settlement and
telling the states they could take it or leave it. The 18 remaining
states split down the middle, and the dissidents lost a major voice
when New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer joined in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The nine holdout states, now financed largely by California, had
depleted resources and a judge that proved to be more inscrutable,
meticulous and conservative than her predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, the settlement was a tough hurdle for the states to
overcome, said former Justice Department lawyer Daniel M. Wall. But
he said the team "had great witnesses; they had help from outside
lawyers representing Sun and other Microsoft rivals."</TE>
<TE>   From the start, the states angered Kollar-Kotelly by causing a
one-week delay in the court proceedings. Days later, they compounded
their woes by modifying some of the antitrust sanctions they sought
and by trying to introduce testimony from more than a dozen Microsoft
employees after the deadline for witnesses had passed.</TE>
<TE>   The case put on by the states fell short in several ways,
Kollar-Kotelly wrote. They produced only one economic expert, and he
disagreed with some of their proposed remedies. And they tried to
introduce evidence of wrongdoing that the appeals court hadn't found
to be illegal -- or had told the government to try to prove again, in
new proceedings the states had opted to skip.</TE>
<TE>   "Plaintiffs sought to gather all existing complaints regarding
Microsoft's business practices and bring them before the court at
this late stage," Kollar-Kotelly wrote Friday. "Plaintiffs have shown
little respect for the parameters of liability that were so precisely
delineated by the appellate court."</TE>
<TE>   Learning From Missteps</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft meanwhile was applying the lessons from its earlier
courtroom failures.</TE>
<TE>   One of the company's darkest hours had come before Judge Jackson,
in February 1999, when it played a videotape that was supposed to
prove a key defense point but instead undermined Microsoft's
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   The video was supposed to reenact a demonstration showing that
removing components of Internet Explorer impaired the Windows 98
operating system. In a moment out of "Perry Mason," Boies replayed
the tape, isolating frames that showed the video was a composite.</TE>
<TE>   Equally damaging was Gates' videotaped deposition, in which he
seemed unwilling to answer questions as basic as whether he had
marked an e-mail as high-priority.</TE>
<TE>   But Microsoft changed everything during the second trial. To
project a less combative image, the company hired former Iran-Contra
prosecutor Dan K. Webb, a Chicago trial lawyer known for his
unflappable demeanor.</TE>
<TE>   And when Gates appeared in the flesh, he came across as
cooperative and truthful.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kollar-Kotelly chastised both sides during the 32-day
trial, Microsoft benefited from her keeping the trial focused on
narrow antitrust issues. And with scant experience in technology and
antitrust cases, she seemed reluctant to stake out territory in
fields with which she was unfamiliar.</TE>
<TE>   "It would take a judge with a lot of self-confidence to go against
the Justice Department, which has great expertise in antitrust
matters," said Robert Lande, a law professor at the University of
Baltimore. "But here you have a judge with no antitrust experience
and no technology experience.... It's asking a lot to have her stick
her neck out."</TE>

<HD>Costa Mesa Council Race Becomes a West-Side Story</HD>
<DH>The five candidates differ on the city's role in shaping
the industrial, commercial and residential area, which is mostly
Latino.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vivian LeTran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Costa Mesa's west side -- an industrial neighborhood mixed with
rental housing, shops, street vendors and mom-and-pop businesses --
is the key talking point in the City Council race as candidates
debate how large a role the city should play in shaping the area's
future.</LD>
<LD>   Five candidates -- two incumbents, two planning commissioners and
a county law enforcement officer -- are battling in Tuesday's
election for two council seats.</LD>
<LD>   Some candidates, including Mayor Linda Dixon, Planning Commission
Chairwoman Katrina Foley and Deputy Sheriff Allan R. Mansoor, have
championed improvements in the commercial and residential community
west of Harbor Boulevard, an older section of town they believe is
blighted.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel strongly about looking at redevelopment and beautification
of the area," said Dixon, who wants to see more homes and fewer
low-end rental units in the area. Dixon said she has no specific
plans for rezoning the area.</TE>
<TE>   The west side neighborhood is a mix of middle-income homeowners,
with homes valued at up to $400,000, and rental units. Chains as well
as mom-and-pop shops and Mexican-style street vendors make up the
retail landscape.</TE>
<TE>   While nearly everyone concedes that street improvements and
landscaping are needed, some voters believe the talk of redevelopment
is aimed at dealing with the predominantly Latino community living in
multifamily units.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very sensitive issue," because average-income families
can't afford the high cost of homes in the city anymore, said Hank
Panian, 74, who has lived in Costa Mesa since 1956. Anti-immigrant
sentiments have always arisen, he added, especially during elections.</TE>
<TE>   "The race and ethnicity bias is still a big problem in the city,"
Panian said. "Time and time again, the Anglos-versus-Latinos debates
keep creeping into the issues."</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Gary Monahan, a restaurateur and councilman, said the
call for improvements is not a veiled way to force out Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "The Latinos in this community want what we all want:
better-quality housing, better services and a neighborhood that's
safe," said Monahan, 43, adding that some low-income housing would be
provided as part of the redevelopment plan. "If the west side is
improved, then all the residents benefit. It has nothing to do with
the different cultures."</TE>
<TE>   Monahan and candidate William "Bill" Perkins speak out against
ordinances they believe are too restrictive and infringe on personal
freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to work on improving Costa Mesa without heavy
restrictions placed on individuals who already do their part," said
Perkins, 26, a retailer and planning commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   As an incumbent, Monahan said he has spoken out against Costa Mesa
ordinances he views as heavy-handed, such as the strict review of
second-story home additions and restrictions on chain-link fences.</TE>
<TE>   "Costa Mesa has always had a less bureaucratic, live-and-let-live
attitude," Monahan said. "My campaign is about keeping the overly
burdensome government from intruding on our personal rights."</TE>
<TE>   Panian said he will vote for candidates based on how responsive
they are to residents' concerns and how they deal with problems that
affect the entire city, such as educational and recreational programs
for youths.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned about the issues of the city as a whole being dealt
with, not just the west side or a specific section," he said.</TE>

<HD>Candidates Trudge On as Voters Tune Out</HD>

<LD>The major candidates for California governor struggled Saturday to
rouse voters who have tuned out or grown turned off by months of
ceaseless attacks, as the bitter contest hurtled into its final 48
hours.</LD>
<LD>   Incumbent Democrat Gray Davis, the front-runner, had just a single
event, a traditional get-out-the-vote rally at a Pittsburg union
hall. "If you want to go forward, stick with the winning team in
Sacramento," Davis told about 200 ironworkers, painters and
machinists, who spent the morning knocking on doors, urging people to
the polls. "If you want to go backwards, the other guy's your
choice."</LD>
<LD>   Republican challenger Bill Simon Jr. covered more turf as he bid
to make up ground, skipping up the coast from Santa Barbara to
Monterey, then inland to San Jose and the Central Valley. "We only
have to put up with Gray Davis for four days!" Simon shouted to
roughly three dozen supporters at an airport rally in Santa Barbara.
"Four more days," the crowd chanted.</LD>
<TE>   Simon, who traveled with other candidates on the state GOP ticket,
is seeking to buck history: It has been 60 years since a California
governor was denied a second term.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a target in Republican races across the state, was trying
to make history as well. The governor was hoping not just to win a
second term on Tuesday, but also to lead Democrats to the first party
sweep of statewide offices since 1950.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever wins the governorship, he will have little in the way of a
mandate, given a campaign focused more on tactics and innuendo than
anything either man hopes to accomplish in office.</TE>
<TE>   "After most elections, you've learned something about what voters
think about taxes or crime or abortion or immigration," said Dan
Schnur, a Republican communications strategist who sat out the
governor's race. "In this campaign, the two most significant
questions are whether Gray Davis has been a corrupt governor and
whether Bill Simon has been a competent candidate."</TE>
<TE>   Dispiriting as many find it, the race for governor will have
important implications, not just in Sacramento -- where the next
chief executive will immediately face a monstrous budget deficit --
but also in the 2004 presidential race, when California will figure
heavily in both parties' calculations.</TE>
<TE>   Despite tens of millions of dollars spent by the two leading
candidates, the 2002 governor's race probably won't be the most
expensive in state history; that contest, topping $118 million, was
held four years ago. It likely will not even be the costliest this
year; in the New York governor's race, three candidates, including a
free-spending billionaire, will outpace California's.</TE>
<TE>   But it may set a record for voter discontent. Many analysts
forecast the lowest turnout in modern California history.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen, in the 30 years I've been watching, a greater
dissatisfaction with the electoral process," said Bruce Cain, an
analyst at UC Berkeley's Institute for Governmental Studies. "The
emphasis on character assassination as the primary focus of the
campaign has really bothered people and driven them up the wall."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, negative campaigning is hardly new. In fact, it is
standard practice for incumbents like Davis with low popularity
ratings and whose best chance to win, in the words of Democratic
strategist Darry Sragow, is "by beating the daylights out of the
alternative."</TE>
<TE>   Having succeeded in tarnishing Simon, Davis has lately devoted
himself to rallying his party's base, an effort that continued with
Saturday's union rally in Pittsburg.</TE>
<TE>   With the sleeves of his blue dress shirt rolled up, Davis touted
his record on union issues and promised to do more for organized
labor in a second term. "This is not about me," Davis told the
workers, gathered in a parking lot wedged between warehouses and
lumberyards in an industrial neighborhood. "I'm just the vehicle for
your hopes and aspirations."</TE>
<TE>   He asked labor members to volunteer for at least one more shift of
precinct walking -- and encouraged them to do three or four. "You can
sleep in all day Wednesday," the governor joked. "I'll sign a note."
After the rally, Davis spent about 40 minutes talking to people in a
nearby working-class neighborhood, urging them to vote.</TE>
<TE>   At one house, Davis gave the family a leaflet touting union
measures he had signed into law. "All these things we did here, he's
against," Davis said of Simon as he pointed to the flier.</TE>
<TE>   Among the verities proved once more this election season is the
difficulty faced by first-time candidates running atop the ticket in
California. Simon's frequent campaign stumbles point up a lesson
previously learned by wealthy businessmen Michael Huffington, Al
Checchi, William Matson Roth and Norton Simon, among others, that
"political experience counts," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior
scholar at USC's School of Policy, Planning and Development.
"Political instincts are important."</TE>
<TE>   While GOP strategists continued to publicly express their
confidence in Simon, privately, their assessments were more somber.
One concern was the effect a big loss might have on the rest of the
statewide ticket -- and that contributed to Simon's aggressive tone
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by his ticket-mates, the GOP challenger spent much of
his time on the attack. "Davis has not improved our schools," Simon
said. "He brags about his track record with our kids. But everybody
knows that we've got 2 million kids trapped in our failing schools."</TE>
<TE>   Davis fails to recognize that California's water and power systems
are in "crisis," Simon continued, and he predicted "the first thing
he would do if he's reelected is raise your taxes."</TE>
<TE>   The governor enters Tuesday's election with both momentum and
precedent on his side. But he remains a deeply unpopular figure
across the state. Indeed, Davis has served this election season as a
kind of all-purpose villain in Republican races up and down the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Bruce McPherson of Santa Cruz, the GOP candidate for
lieutenant governor, has broadcast a television ad suggesting he
would serve as a brake on Davis in a second term -- even though he
insisted Saturday he wasn't writing Simon off.</TE>
<TE>   "As part of our system of checks and balances, California's
lieutenant governor is independently elected," McPherson, who is
challenging incumbent Democrat Cruz Bustamante, reminded voters. "But
it only works if the lieutenant governor speaks up when the governor
is wrong. I won't stay silent. I'll speak up for California."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' name has popped up in a bitter Assembly race in Contra
Costa County, a neck-and-neck fight in the affluent East Bay suburbs
that is perhaps the most hotly contested legislative race in
California. "If you like Gray Davis, you're going to love Donna
Gerber," said a GOP mailer for her Republican rival, Guy Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The governor has even surfaced as a boogeyman in Irvine's
municipal elections, where Republican strategists have gone after the
governor as a stand-in for Democrat Larry Agran, the incumbent mayor.
"People identify with it immediately and understand the connection,"
said Rob Stutzman, a GOP consultant working on Irvine's City Council
races.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis has become a symbol for incompetence and mismanagement that
can be applied across the board."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the state and local levels, the race for governor also
carries implications in the next race for the White House, quietly
underway now for months.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has long been mentioned as a possible White House contestant
-- the speculation comes with the job -- and the governor has done
nothing to quell the talk. Even if Davis decides against running for
president, as close advisors expect, he could still be a major
irritant to President Bush. That is one of the reasons that national
Republicans tried to soften Davis up last year with attack
advertising launched even before his reelection effort began.</TE>
<TE>   If he wins Tuesday, Davis is expected to sit down with advisors to
consider whether to seek the White House, as three of his four
predecessors have. But even if he is reelected handily, many in the
Democratic Party dismiss Davis' chances.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody believes his success in the campaign was due almost
wholly to the ineptitude of his opponent, which doesn't set him up
for great things," said one party strategist in Washington, who is
close to several other possible presidential contestants.</TE>
<TE>   For Republicans, yet another loss at the top of the ticket -- the
fourth in successive statewide elections -- would hardly offer much
encouragement for Bush, who, like his father eight years before, lost
California in a landslide in 2000. Whatever happens Tuesday, "There's
going to need to be a healthy debate about the direction of the party
[in California] and how to put together a winning coalition," said
Scott Reed, a veteran GOP strategist in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the California governor's race has enshrined one page in
the political playbook: Davis' brash intervention in the GOP primary
served as a model in other states, with varying degrees of success.</TE>
<TE>   By spending roughly $10 million on ads savaging the Republican
front-runner, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Davis helped
Simon storm past Riordan in a major upset -- and handed the governor
the opponent he much preferred to face.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans tried a similar tack, meddling in Democratic primaries
in Massachusetts and Florida, but the strategy didn't work there. If
anything, analysts say, the effort backfired in Florida, where
attacks on Democrat Bill McBride actually elevated his status and
helped push him past former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, the candidate
incumbent Republican Jeb Bush would rather have run against on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The brother of the president is now locked in a stiff fight for
reelection. But the failure of the pick-your-opponent strategy in
Florida may simply speak to another of the verities of this election
season: the importance of money.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans "just didn't spend enough" trying to take McBride out
in the primary, said Lance dehaven-Smith, a Florida State University
political scientist. Had the GOP spent a Davis-sized sum,
Dehaven-Smith said, "absolutely it would have worked. No doubt about
it."</TE>

<HD>Temple Opens Door to Jewish History</HD>
<DH>New mini-museum in Aliso Viejo will exhibit items from
large institutions. Founders see it as a resource for the entire
community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Temple Beth El in Aliso Viejo will open a small museum today
dedicated to educating the public about Jewish history, becoming one
of only a handful of synagogues in the United States that house such
an institution.</LD>
<LD>   The Kershaw Museum will open with the exhibit "Triumph of Light:
The Hanukkah Menorah" that features 60 menorahs -- some dating from
the 18th century -- and a free lecture tonight by a scholar of the
ancient Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   "We were fortunate to have this beautiful space" in Temple Beth
El's new $18-million building, said Norma Kershaw, who, with her
husband, Reuben, endowed the museum through a family trust. "And a
museum of Jewish history will be a tremendous enrichment to the
culture in Orange County and beyond."</LD>
<TE>   The idea for the mini-museum -- the pieces are displayed in a
space about the size of a classroom -- was a collaborative effort
between Rabbi Allen Krause, a history buff, and Norma Kershaw, a
congregant, art historian and archeologist. She serves on the board
of a variety of international organizations devoted to ancient art.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just natural for me to connect with Norma," Krause said.</TE>
<TE>   Kershaw brought in an expert to design the museum with
professional lighting, high-quality display cases and decor
appropriate for a major cultural venue. She also lined up nationally
renowned speakers on Middle Eastern history and art to give lectures.</TE>
<TE>   Jodi Magness, a professor of religious studies at the University
of North Carolina and author of the recently released book "The
Archaeology of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls," will speak at 7:30
tonight on menorahs in the ancient synagogues of Israel. In December,
George Bass, called the "father of nautical archeology," will tell
about the artifacts found on a wrecked ship that sailed in 14th
century B.C. from what is now Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the museum include displaying samples of major exhibits
from Los Angeles museums, including the Skirball Cultural Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not in competition with anyone," Kershaw said. "By having a
smaller version of a large exhibit, it's like giving out little hors
d'oeuvres."</TE>
<TE>   The temple has been promised ancient pottery on permanent loan
from Skirball and Hebrew Union College in Jerusalem. Work is underway
to turn an alcove outside the one-room museum into a model of a
"tel," a mound that grows over centuries as successive civilizations
build upon the ruins of their predecessors. On the walls will be maps
of the Middle East and a historical timeline.</TE>
<TE>   Krause said the temple has sent letters to public and private
schools in south Orange County, inviting schoolchildren to view the
exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   "We look to it to be a source of Jewish knowledge for the entire
Orange County community, not just for our congregation, not just for
Jews," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The menorahs in the inaugural exhibit were contributed by
congregants and other Orange County Jews. They are large and small
and made of silver, brass and tin. Some hold candles, others burn
oil. A number of 2,000-year-old ceramic oil lamps -- precursors to
the menorahs -- are also on display.</TE>
<TE>   The eight days of Hanukkah, which begin this year Nov. 29,
celebrate the rededication of the temple in Jerusalem in 165 B.C.
This followed a military victory over the Syrians, who had taken
control of the temple and tried to stamp out Judaism. To mark the
event, one menorah candle is lighted on the first night of Hanukkah
with an additional candle lighted each of the next seven nights.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the menorahs come with moving stories. Holding her
scratched and dinged family menorah, Irene Breisacher reminisced
about how her late husband, Walter, escaped Nazi Germany with the
menorah at age 16.</TE>

<HD>Battle Over Breakup Enters Final Hours</HD>
<DH>Supporters and foes of cityhood for the Valley and
Hollywood use precinct walkers, rallies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sue Fox and Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With just three days to go before voters decide whether to break up
Los Angeles, the anti-secession campaign led by Mayor James K. Hahn
swarmed the San Fernando Valley with more than 1,000 precinct walkers
Saturday, while a few dozen separatists staged a rally in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   It was a stark reflection of the lopsided forces battling over the
future shape of the nation's second-largest city. Fortified by $6
million in contributions from developers, unions and others, Hahn's
L.A. United campaign has dominated the debate with blunt warnings
that a split could increase taxes and deplete public services.</LD>
<LD>   Other anti-secession efforts spearheaded by council members and
union leaders raked in an additional $1 million for the campaigns to
keep Los Angeles together.</LD>
<TE>   "We have put together a broad coalition who love this city and
want to save this city," Hahn said at a boisterous San Fernando rally
jammed with local politicians and about 600 electricians, sanitation
workers and other union members. "That's why we are going to be able
to win on election day."</TE>
<TE>   Another 200 workers showed up at the union hall later to pick up
lists of union households to visit. As the workers fanned out across
the Valley, the mayor headed to another rally at the Encino
headquarters of the Democratic Party of the San Fernando Valley. The
Democrats dispatched about 300 volunteers to urge people to reject
secession.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away in Sherman Oaks, secessionists threw a vintage
car parade, honking horns and waving signs from three Model-T Fords
and a Mustang convertible.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of female candidates seeking council seats in the
proposed Valley city led the charge over the Cahuenga Pass and into
Hollywood, where they joined a pro-secession women's rally.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all candidates, God love us!" Terry Stone, a candidate in
the proposed 10th Valley council district, shouted to a man sitting
outside a fast-food restaurant. "Let our people go!"</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood rally drew about 35 people. Acknowledging they were
up against powerful opponents, speakers exhorted fellow activists to
press ahead in the final days of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our chance to make our neighborhoods our own," shouted
Hollywood secessionist Missy Kelly. "Call your neighbors! Call your
friends! Get out the vote!"</TE>
<TE>   Across the city in Woodland Hills, one of the leading candidates
for Valley mayor juggled two phones as he kept up a steady patter of
cold calls urging strangers to vote for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I need your vote," Mel Wilson told one voter. "We have a very
important election coming up."</TE>
<TE>   It was the end game in a campaign that catapulted the secession
proposals from vague threats -- generally dismissed by City Hall --
into the voting booth.</TE>
<TE>   Simply getting secession onto Tuesday's ballot was a hard-won
achievement for the separatists. Since then, however, their
five-month campaign has been crippled by meager fund-raising,
leadership woes, a lack of volunteers and a failure to attract
well-known candidates to run for office.</TE>
<TE>   Valley and Hollywood separatists have raised a combined $1.7
million, limiting their message to cable television networks while
their opponents blanket the airwaves with ads branding secession "a
gamble that's not worth taking."</TE>
<TE>   A recent Times Poll of likely voters found overwhelming opposition
citywide to both breakup proposals. Valley residents were more
closely divided, however, with likely voters in the East Valley
opposing the breakup even as those in the West Valley were split on
the prospect.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the campaign, Hahn and his allies have tried to raise
doubts on secession's impact in a number of areas, notably public
safety and finances: Would taxes go up? Could services be slashed?
What about police and fire protection in the event of an earthquake?</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists brush off such concerns as "scare tactics" from city
leaders desperate to stay in power. They insist a smaller city would
trim the fat from a bloated L.A. government, providing better
services for a cheaper price.</TE>
<TE>   Communicating that message to a city of 3.7 million people has
been difficult, however. Valley secessionists have spent little time
or money reaching out to residents south of Mulholland Drive, the
dividing line between the Valley and the rest of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, meanwhile, millionaire nightclub owner Gene La
Pietra has almost single-handedly bankrolled the breakup bid -- but
even he balked at the cost of running ads on broadcast TV stations.</TE>
<TE>   To win, secession needs a majority vote in the breakaway areas and
citywide. Separatists are banking on a large turnout of pro-cityhood
voters in the Valley -- which generally has a high turnout -- to
carry the election citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Roxy Tuetken, a retired teacher from Studio City who supports
Valley independence, went looking for those voters Saturday morning
in a leafy neighborhood near her home.</TE>
<TE>   "Hello!" she called over a fence to one man while waving a
pro-secession pamphlet in the air. "I'm here just to encourage you to
vote for secession on Tuesday." "I'm against it," the man replied
tersely. The dog at his feet began to growl.</TE>
<TE>   Tuetken, a 68-year-old volunteer who hasn't walked precincts since
Ronald Reagan ran for governor, marched off to the next house. "I
think people are scared," she said, noting that some of her friends
oppose secession because they fear higher taxes or the loss of
rent-control laws. "You know, it takes a certain amount of courage to
go into the unknown."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also hit the streets Saturday, trooping door-to-door
with a few union members in Valley Village. One voter told Hahn he
planned to vote for secession because he believes City Hall has
mistreated the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest objection is I'm not seeing tax dollars spent
proportionally in the Valley," Rees Barr, an engineer, told the
mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's election comes after decades of political skirmishing
between Valley activists and downtown leaders. Ever since the region
joined Los Angeles in 1915 to gain access to water, some Valley
dwellers have grumbled about what they perceived as inadequate public
services from a distant City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest campaign, led by the secession group Valley VOTE,
separatists collected signatures from 25% of the Valley's registered
voters to trigger a study of a breakup. After a two-year review, the
Local Agency Formation Commission concluded that Valley and Hollywood
cities could be financially viable without hurting the rest of Los
Angeles, clearing the way for a citywide vote.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by voters, a Valley city would be born on July 1,
2003, as the nation's sixth-largest. An elected mayor and 14 city
council members would oversee a $1.2-billion budget and a sprawling
city of 1.35 million people.</TE>
<TE>   A Hollywood city would begin with a $183-million budget. Home to
184,000 residents, it would be run by five at-large council members
who would choose a mayor from their ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles would lose a third of its residents and nearly half
its land in the breakup. It would become the nation's third-largest
city, behind New York and Chicago. To shield what remained of L.A.
from financial harm, the Valley would have to pay $127 million the
first year. Hollywood would owe L.A. $21.3 million. These so-called
alimony payments would drop 5% annually over 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   In a confusing bit of math difficult for many voters to follow,
the alimony payments -- while they may seem like money snatched from
the Valley and Hollywood's pockets -- actually represent cash those
taxpayers already send downtown beyond what those areas receive in
services. Because the payments would decline over time, secession
leaders say they will actually be plugging the hole.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley, for instance, would get to keep $1.3 billion over 20
years -- money that otherwise would flow to other parts of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO found that the new cities would have sufficient reserves for
at least three years. They would initially contract with Los Angeles
for nearly all municipal services, but eventually they could form
their own agencies, hire employees and renegotiate union contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, on the streets of Valley Village, Hahn argued against
that prospect. He told residents, "I love the Valley and I don't want
to lose you."</TE>

<HD>Election Reflects National Parity</HD>
<DH>GOP will probably keep grip on the House while Democrats
retain the Senate, analysts say. But neither party has any wiggle
room for error.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As the race for control of Congress sprints through its final
weekend, voters appear poised to maintain the narrow division of
power that has marked American politics for nearly a decade.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts in both parties consider Republicans the favorite to
maintain -- and possibly even expand -- their slender six-seat
majority in the House. And Democrats seem positioned to maintain --
or enlarge -- their one-seat Senate majority. Enough races remained
within reach, however, to sustain Republican hopes of a takeover.</LD>
<LD>   What seems least likely on Tuesday are decisive gains for either
party in either chamber. After months of campaigning, vast
expenditures and endless cycles of attacks and counterattacks through
televised ads, this election may not do much to alter the basic
parity between the parties vividly demonstrated in the razor-thin
2000 presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore.</LD>
<TE>   "The 2000 election was ultimately a story about how evenly divided
the country is politically, and that story line is very much
continued in 2002," said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin.</TE>
<TE>   Because the country, and Congress, are so closely split, each
party is operating with virtually no margin of error. By holding the
House and gaining just a single seat in the Senate, Republicans would
reestablish unified control of the federal government and greatly
improve the odds for President Bush to advance his agenda in the next
two years.</TE>
<TE>   Alternately, if Democrats can take back the House while holding
the Senate, they would be in position to highlight their ideas -- and
perhaps place Bush on the defensive leading into his reelection
campaign, just as a Democratic Congress did with his father in 1991
and 1992.</TE>
<TE>   With Congress so evenly divided, virtually every competitive race
around the country has become a proxy war between the national
parties and their allied interest groups. The Senate, in particular,
is so precariously balanced that just a few thousand voters -- or
perhaps hundreds -- in states such as Colorado, New Hampshire and
South Dakota are likely to decide which party holds the majority.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the close races is an exquisite balance of conflicting
forces.</TE>
<TE>   Boosting Republicans have been Bush's high approval rating and a
perception among many voters that the party is better able to handle
national security and terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Boosting Democrats have been comparable advantages for their party
on domestic issues such as Social Security and health care, along
with widespread gloom over the economy. Many analysts believe,
though, that the Democratic failure to articulate an alternative
economic plan has prevented the party from establishing a consistent
advantage when voters are asked which side can better produce
prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   These contrasting forces have produced an electoral environment
where candidates have been slugging it out without help from a
discernible national tailwind for either side.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone keeps waiting for this election to break toward one side
or the other," said GOP pollster Bill McInturff. "Well, it doesn't
have to break."</TE>
<TE>   In all, voters this year are selecting 34 senators, 36 governors
and all 435 members of the House.</TE>
<TE>   These three groups of races have been moving in different
directions. Democrats appear certain to gain ground in the
governorships -- in part because Republicans are defending twice as
many seats. The Senate is a toe-to-toe title fight that could see
either party make small gains. And Republicans have grown
increasingly optimistic about the prospects for retaining control of
the House.</TE>
<TE>   In the House races, history favors the Democrats. Since the Civil
War, the party holding the White House has gained House seats in a
president's first midterm election only once: in 1934, when the glow
surrounding Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal propelled Democrats to a
nine-seat advance.</TE>
<TE>   But through the fall, Democrats have seen a number of
once-promising races deteriorate. In four contests where
redistricting has forced Democratic and Republican incumbents to run
against each other, Republicans now hold clear advantages in three.
Democratic challenges against such Republican representatives as Jim
Nussle in Iowa, Shelley Moore Capito in West Virginia and Rob Simmons
in Connecticut appear to have faded. And Republicans have established
advantages in open or new seats in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado,
Nevada, Georgia, Louisiana and New Hampshire that Democrats once
targeted.</TE>
<TE>   In their final assessments, the two major independent analysts
tracking House races gave Republicans strong odds of holding the
chamber. Stuart Rothenberg, publisher of a political newsletter, gave
the GOP the advantage in 220 seats (two more than the 218 needed for
a majority), Democrats the advantage in 207, with eight too close to
call.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Cook, who publishes a competing political newsletter,
identified 217 districts leaning toward the GOP, 202 toward the
Democrats and 16 as too close to call.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats aren't ready to throw in the towel on the House. But
they acknowledge that the party will need the political equivalent of
an inside straight, winning virtually all of the remaining
competitive seats, to capture the majority.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got enough races within the margin of error that it is
difficult to predict what is going to happen," said one senior House
Democratic aide. "But to win the House back, it has to be a flawless
election."</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, the needle is tilting toward the Democrats,
analysts in both parties agree. "We are just running out of room in
terms of seats," says one top GOP strategist.</TE>
<TE>   But there are enough conflicting polls, and neck-and-neck races,
that the outcome is still in doubt--so much so that it might not be
clear for weeks which party holds the Senate majority.</TE>
<TE>   That prospect is raised by the unusual nature of Louisiana's
election system. Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu holds a large lead in
the polls over three Republicans. But if she doesn't receive more
than 50% of the vote on Tuesday, she will have to face the
second-place finisher Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   If the Republicans and Democrats come out of election day tied at
49 senators each -- Vermont's James M. Jeffords is an independent --
and Landrieu doesn't clear 50%, the stage would be set for an
unprecedented monthlong siege between the parties over the Louisiana
seat. For now, Landrieu appears on track to just avoid a runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming Landrieu holds on, six seats seem most likely to decide
Senate control, with three others looming as potential surprises.</TE>
<TE>   Each party has one incumbent who appears especially endangered.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Tim Hutchinson (R-Ark.), a social conservative hurt by
controversy over his divorce and remarriage, has consistently trailed
Democratic Atty. Gen. Mark Pryor, who has run an effective campaign
blending centrist and populist themes.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jean Carnahan (D-Mo.), appointed to the seat in 2000 after
her husband, Mel Carnahan, was killed in a plane crash yet still won
the election, has trailed former Republican Rep. Jim Talent in most
of the latest surveys.</TE>
<TE>   Each side has two other seats at significant risk. Republicans are
straining to hold seats in Colorado and New Hampshire; Democrats in
Minnesota and South Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   In Colorado, first-term Sen. Wayne Allard has struggled in a
rematch against Democrat Tom Strickland. The state leans toward the
GOP, but Strickland appears to be pulling ahead in late public polls.</TE>
<TE>   In New Hampshire's Senate race, outgoing Democratic Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen has opened a small but consistent lead over GOP Rep. John
Sununu in three of the four public polls released late last week.
Emphasizing her support for abortion rights, Shaheen is benefiting
from a huge advantage among women over Sununu, who ousted Republican
Sen. Bob Smith in a primary.</TE>
<TE>   In South Dakota, GOP Rep. John R. Thune and Democratic Sen. Tim
Johnson have been jostling within the polling margin of error all
year. This race is likely to be decided by which side does a better
job of turning out its supporters.</TE>
<TE>   In Minnesota, the first public poll last week showed former Vice
President Walter F. Mondale comfortably leading Republican Norm
Coleman in a Senate race upended by the death in a plane crash of
Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone. But a Wellstone memorial that morphed
into a campaign rally generated a backlash, and both sides see the
race tightening.</TE>
<TE>   Three other races hold the greatest potential for an upset. An
Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll late last week showed Sen. Max
Cleland (D-Ga.) clinging to just a three-point lead among likely
voters over Republican Rep. Saxby Chambliss. And Democratic
candidates Erskine Bowles and Ron Kirk remain within range of
Republican rivals Elizabeth Dole and John Cornyn respectively for
open seats now held by the GOP in North Carolina and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   In the governorships, Democrat Gray Davis is favored in California
and Republican incumbents Rick Perry, George Pataki and Jeb Bush are
given the edge in the other three largest states: Texas, New York and
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats are expecting to recapture governorships in Michigan,
Pennsylvania and probably Illinois. Republicans are optimistic about
ousting Democratic incumbents in Alabama and South Carolina, which
would reverse a Democratic mini-revival in the region.</TE>
<TE>   In a closely watched race, Democratic Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy
Townsend, the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, has struggled against
Republican Rep. Bob Ehrlich in Maryland, despite the state's strong
Democratic tilt.</TE>
<TE>   That's a fitting emblem for a year in which so many statewide
races are so close that both parties are sweating the campaign's
final hours.</TE>

<HD>Few Clues, Many Theories on 'Executions' in Desert</HD>
<DH>Whoever bound and shot eight migrants in Arizona wanted
them found, sheriff says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan K. Stack</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MARICOPA COUNTY, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>When their time came, the men were brought to these rough washes of
bleached sand and broken rock. They died in a place that feels
bottomless, where nothing but the echo of passing jets breaks the
desert silence and there is nobody around to hear gunshots or cries
or crunching tires.</LD>
<LD>   Eight migrants have been shot dead since March in a desolate patch
of rattlesnake holes and scraggly paloverde trees where Interstate 10
rolls west out of Phoenix. Their hands were pulled back and bound
with handcuffs, duct tape or the waistband of their own jockey
shorts. They were shot at close range, their bodies left to mummify
in the sun.</LD>
<LD>   "I call these executions," said Sheriff Joseph M. Arpaio. "I
believe they were tied up, driven to that area and killed. It was
brazen; they didn't try to bury the bodies. They're trying to send a
message."</LD>
<TE>   The trouble is, there are no known witnesses and no leads -- just
an inscrutable landscape that swallows footprints and tire tracks as
if they were never there. A mounted posse is hunting for more bodies.
Meanwhile, officials are baffled over what the killings portend.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has their theories," says Alan Hubbard, director of
protection for the Mexican consulate in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's drug warfare, or turf battles between immigrant
smuggling organizations, or some combination of the two. The slayings
could be punishment for migrants unable to cough up the fees they owe
their smugglers, or graphic calling cards from Arizona's notorious
anti-immigration vigilantes. Arizona's migrants are in the midst of
the deadliest year in history -- at least 169 Mexicans have died
trying to cross the state's brutal desert since January.</TE>
<TE>   In this new mystery, worried investigators see a harbinger of
bloodier days -- a sign that the ruthless warfare that periodically
rages along the border has crept deep into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Never, never have we had a pattern of execution-style murders in
this area," Arpaio said. "Why would I be stupid enough to say I have
eight murders I can't solve? Because in my mind I think we have a
dead end. We're just not getting anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   In a daunting vacuum of information, there is little to
investigate but the victims themselves. And so, in a sketchy group of
dead migrants, investigators are struggling to discern a pattern.
They compare fingerprints with immigration records, scour pockets for
scrawled addresses, hand photographs over to the Mexican government
to be posted south of the border.</TE>
<TE>   One of the bodies was so badly decomposed that investigators have
meager hope of pulling even a name from the remains. And even when
prints match an immigration record, it can cause confusion: Migrants
often give fake names to authorities. "We had one man call us from
Mexico and say, 'That's my brother, but you've got the wrong name,' "
Hubbard said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the men were born in Mexico; the only exception identified
so far is Daniel Vargas Baena, a 19-year-old from Ecuador. When the
consulate phoned a Mexican woman whose number was jotted on a slip of
paper in the dead man's pocket, she said she sneaked with Vargas
Baena into the United States. The Border Patrol caught them, though,
and the pair lost touch.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the slain men were locked up for drug charges in the same
cell of the county jail last summer. And in two of the killings, the
gunman fired a .38 Super, a gun that used to be a weapon of choice in
Mexico. Beyond those faint connections, the victims are a baffling
assortment. Tracking down their families is tough; convincing them to
talk is even more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   It was this very phenomenon that inspired the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to ignore the immigration status of witnesses
who came forth with leads during the hunt for the Washington,
D.C.-area sniper. Looking on from Arizona, Arpaio's temper smoldered.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff sat down and penned a letter to the INS. In it, he
asked that tipsters who could feed his investigation be given the
same protection granted to potential Washington witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "The loss of life in Maricopa County is no less regrettable than
the murders along the East Coast freeway system," he wrote. "Our
intelligence resources indicate that illegal aliens with potential
information are reluctant to come forward." The INS agreed to look
for ways to cooperate with the sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   Here on the edge of the torrential streams of people and goods
that run between Mexico and the United States, officials read
disappearances, arrests and drug busts like augurs. The crimes are
glimpses into the illicit trade lines that lace the two nations.</TE>
<TE>   Arpaio, who for years prowled among drug traffickers as DEA
director in Mexico City, has rigged an intelligence network
throughout Maricopa County. Drawing on those sources, he says some
gangs of "coyotes" that had been exclusively preoccupied with the
smuggling of illegal immigrants have expanded their enterprise to run
dope as well. "We feel there's a war going on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Like most desert towns, when Phoenix ends, it ends fast. The tidy
patchwork of urban blocks gives way to trailer parks, alfalfa fields
and rose farms. Those, in turn, taper into vast, monochromatic land
under a huge and brilliant sky. This is where subdivisions grow,
bloom and wither; where land is broken and consumed in the West's
tireless and sprawling expanse.</TE>
<TE>   Interstate 10 runs past a state prison, a truck stop and a gravel
quarry. Thirty miles west of Phoenix, the White Tank Mountains rise
on the horizon like a rocky shrug. The power company cut a network of
dirt roads north of the freeway, but nobody uses them much aside from
ATV enthusiasts, horseback riders and high school kids looking for a
place to drink beer.</TE>
<TE>   These were the garbage-strewn foothills that became a killing
field. To the west, a smooth black road waits for a neighborhood that
never came. Locals call it the "Highway to Nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knows what you're doing out here; nobody knows any
different," says Deputy Sgt. Paul Chagolla. "You can't yell for help.
You can't attract anybody's attention."</TE>
<TE>   The first body turned up in mid-March when scavengers looking for
shell casings stumbled across the remains of a Mexican immigrant
named Pedro Ambrosioso Ochoa-Felix. His hands were wrapped in
telephone cord; he'd been shot several times.</TE>
<TE>   All spring and summer, a new set of bones came to light about once
a month. The most recent discovery came Oct. 13, when a horseback
rider spotted the remains of a Mexican man on a shallow wash of
cactus. His hands were bound by duct tape, and he'd been shot.
Investigators managed to identify him this week but were unable to
track down his family.</TE>
<TE>   Bodies in the Arizona desert are nothing new. The bright
wastelands make easy dumping grounds for all sorts of things: old
paint cans and bed mattresses, stolen cars that thieves light afire
and burn into the sand -- and homicide victims.</TE>
<TE>   But gangland, execution-style killings have generally stuck closer
to the frontier. At least, they have until now. "You don't have this
-- this is unique," said Arpaio.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's a big business to smuggle immigrants. And it's becoming
a violent business."</TE>

<HD>Colombian Government Blocks the Release of 2 Jailed Drug
Lords</HD>
<DH>A judge had ruled that the brothers who headed the Cali
cartel could leave prison early.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>The Colombian government blocked the release from prison of two
former bosses of the Cali cocaine cartel a day after a judge
infuriated President Alvaro Uribe by ruling that the two powerful
drug lords could go free with less than half their sentences served.</LD>
<LD>   "The government has ordered that the prisoners not be released
while many doubts exist," Uribe said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Uribe took office as president in August on pledges to crack down
on illegal armed groups and the drug trade that is fueling the
nation's 38-year-old civil war.</LD>
<TE>   In a surprise move, Judge Pedro Jose Suarez on Friday ordered the
release of brothers Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, who were
sentenced to 17 years and 15 years in prison, respectively, after
their 1995 arrests by elite Colombian police and the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The Rodriguez Orejuela brothers controlled up to 80% of the
world's cocaine after the 1993 killing of drug lord Pablo Escobar,
who led the rival Medellin cartel. The DEA estimated that the Cali
cartel hauled in $7 billion in profits annually in its heyday, and a
top Colombian anti-drug official has said the Cali cartel is still
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Allowing the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers to walk out of prison
would be an international embarrassment for Uribe and would likely
damage Colombia's relations with the United States, which has spent
$1.5 billion in mostly military aid to help Bogota fight a drug
industry that exports about 580 tons of cocaine a year.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has long sought their extradition.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian government accused the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers
of using their "gigantic power" to buy justice, and it immediately
pledged to halt their release from a maximum-security prison near
Bogota, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said he had ordered their release because they had
maintained "correct social behavior in prison."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking from the Colombian island of San Andres, Uribe said:
"These are issues of profound national and international sensitivity.
Their dealings involve the dignity of a nation, the people's
credibility in their institutions, the prestige of justice and
international respectability."</TE>
<TE>   Uribe, a former mayor of Medellin -- the city that saw the rise
and fall of Escobar's multibillion-dollar cocaine empire -- insists
that fighting Colombia's drug trade is key to ending a war that
claims the lives of thousands every year. He wants more U.S.
cooperation in the war on drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-drug officials have said that leftist rebels and right-wing
paramilitary outlaws now control Colombia's drug industry.</TE>

<HD>Dissident Petition Ignored at Meeting of Cuban Legislature</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>Cuba's National Assembly met Saturday but did not discuss a pending
dissident petition for moderate reforms of the island's one-party
Communist government.</LD>
<LD>   The rubber-stamp legislature, which meets twice a year for a few
days, unanimously approved a law granting private agricultural
cooperatives greater profit incentives to spur food production in the
economically battered country.</LD>
<LD>   Dissidents on Thursday called on the assembly to debate their
petition for political and economic reforms that they presented in
May, backed by more than 11,000 signatures. But assembly members said
it was not on the agenda.</LD>
<TE>   President Fidel Castro, whose government has so far ignored the
petition known as the Varela Project, lashed out at his enemies at
the opening session of the 600-member assembly.</TE>
<TE>   "They are like fish out of water. There is no oxygen for
counterrevolution," Castro, 76, and in power since the 1959
revolution, told the assembly.</TE>
<TE>   "They are ideologically defeated. They have no weapons to face the
revolution. All they have is hypocrisy and lies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Varela Project calls for legal reforms to ensure freedom of
expression and assembly, the right to own a private business and the
release of political prisoners, said to number 230 by human rights
groups. It proposes that the reforms be put to Cubans in a
referendum.</TE>
<TE>   The reform petition is led by Christian Democrat Oswaldo Paya, who
last month won the European Parliament's top human rights award.</TE>
<TE>   Most Cubans first heard of the petition when former President
Carter praised it in a speech in Havana in May that was broadcast
live on Cuba's state-run media.</TE>
<TE>   Castro's government responded by marshaling millions of signatures
to push through amendments to the Cuban Constitution that cast in
concrete the socialist nature of the workers' state. The authorities
have ignored requests that the dissident petition be published for
public debate.</TE>

<HD>Former Army Chief of Staff Accepts Post as Israel's Defense
Minister</HD>
<DH>Shaul Mofaz, known as a hard-liner, is appointed after
recent Cabinet upheaval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israel's former army chief of staff accepted the job of defense
minister Saturday, after the post became vacant with the resignation
of Labor Party leader Binyamin Ben-Eliezer from the coalition
government.</LD>
<LD>   Shaul Mofaz's appointment by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is to be
put before Israel's parliament for confirmation Monday, Sharon's
office said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   Mofaz has a reputation as a hard-liner and oversaw the army's
crackdown against the Palestinian uprising for most of the last two
years. He also has advocated exiling Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.</LD>
<TE>   In the West Bank on Saturday, Israeli soldiers thwarted an
attempted suicide bombing when they stopped two Palestinians carrying
an explosive belt in a car at a checkpoint in the West Bank, the army
said.</TE>
<TE>   The men were stopped at Tappuah junction, south of the city of
Nablus, and taken in for questioning. The belt was detonated, an army
statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer and five other Labor ministers quit the government on
Wednesday amid a squabble over settlements funding in the West Bank
and Gaza. The move left Sharon's coalition with only 55 seats in the
120-seat parliament. He is widely expected to turn to ultra-right and
religious parties to muster the majority he needs.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon held talks Friday night with former Premier Benjamin
Netanyahu, offering him the foreign affairs portfolio formerly held
by Labor's Shimon Peres. No decision was reached, and the two planned
to resume talks today, an official said.</TE>
<TE>   A senior official in Sharon's office, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that despite the Cabinet upheaval, the government's
policies would remain unchanged and Israel would honor all its
pledges to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The official did not elaborate, but one of Sharon's commitments to
President Bush is to not physically harm Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in an interview broadcast Saturday on BBC television,
Peres said he thought that the Sharon government's days were now
numbered.</TE>
<TE>   "He can limp on, [but] not for a very long period of time, because
when you have a small coalition -- which means a small grouping with
many parties -- you are in trouble. Every small party becomes a
pressure group," Peres said. The interview took place in Mallorca,
Spain, where Peres was attending an annual Israeli-Palestinian
political conference.</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said a
hard-line government could revitalize liberal opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "An extreme right government could put wind back into the sails of
the peace movement," Dalia Rabin-Pelossof told Israeli television at
a Tel Aviv gathering marking seven years since the Nov. 4, 1995,
assassination of her father.</TE>
<TE>   About 100,000 people turned up for the event, held in the same
square where Rabin was gunned down by an extremist Israeli who
opposed his policy of compromise with the Palestinians, the
television report said.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd watched videotaped greetings from former President
Clinton, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah,
who said that if Rabin were alive today he would be shocked and
angered by the Mideast violence but not discouraged from trying to
end it.</TE>

<HD>Shots Fired Near U.S. Soldiers in Kuwait</HD>
<DH>Four people are being sought by authorities. An American
diplomat, however, said sport shooters are probably responsible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KUWAIT CITY</DL>
<LD>Kuwaiti police searched Saturday for four people who fired guns near
U.S. troops in the latest shooting involving American forces. But a
U.S. diplomat played down the incident, suggesting that the shots may
have come from sport shooters.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody was injured in the Friday incident, which occurred as
Americans trained in the desert south of Kuwait City, officials said.
About one-quarter of the country was declared off-limits for the
military exercises.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. military said the shots came from two white pickup
trucks, each carrying two people. It was unclear what kind of weapons
were used.</LD>
<TE>   Early reports indicated that four people were arrested, but U.S.
authorities withdrew that account without explanation.</TE>
<TE>   An American diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
described the shooting as a "recreational incident" involving young
Kuwaitis firing weapons in the desert near Arifjan, 35 miles south of
Kuwait City.</TE>
<TE>   Concern over the safety of U.S. troops here rose after the fatal
shooting of a Marine and the wounding of another during an attack by
Islamic extremists Oct. 8 on Faylakah island. The two assailants were
killed by other Marines.</TE>
<TE>   Six days later, shots were fired near U.S. troops in the
northwestern desert. Kuwaiti officials said privately that the shots
probably came from Bedouin hunters who were not trying to harm
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the Kuwaiti government sealed off nearly a quarter of
the country -- including the area near the Iraqi border -- saying the
move was to safeguard civilians during ongoing military exercises in
the country's northwestern desert.</TE>
<TE>   But Kuwaiti officials say privately that the closure is also
designed to protect U.S. troops. The shooting Friday took place
outside the closed area.</TE>
<TE>   Attacks on U.S. military personnel have shocked Kuwaitis, who
depend on Washington for protection from Iraq, which invaded this
oil-rich country in 1990. A U.S.-led coalition drove out the Iraqis
the following year.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwait signed a defense pact with Washington after the Iraqis were
defeated.</TE>
<TE>   Many Kuwaiti fundamentalist leaders have said the young people who
attacked U.S. troops were "misguided," and the number of militant
extremists here is believed to be small.</TE>
<TE>   About 10,000 American forces are in Kuwait for routine desert
training or maintaining equipment positioned to defend the country.
U.S. fighter jets use two Kuwaiti air bases to patrol a "no-fly" zone
in southern Iraq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Because county prosecutors are mere mortals, we can't demand
perfection. They don't have to win every case they take to trial.</LD>
<LD>   But we'd like to believe that anyone they haul into court with a
murder charge wrapped around his neck is the right guy. And as an
added bonus, that they can at least come close to proving it to a
jury.</LD>
<LD>   If you disagree -- that is, if the plight of the accused doesn't
faze you -- look up what it costs to defend yourself in court. Or go
spend some time in jail awaiting trial. Or imagine how people look at
you when they find out you're on trial for murder.</LD>
<TE>   Having never faced those situations, I'll play a hunch: It ain't
no fun.</TE>
<TE>   That puts a moral burden on prosecutors to take the right people
to trial. In deciding last week not to retry Hugh "Randy" McDonald
for the 1997 murder of Janie Pang, prosecutors proved they blew it
the first time around.</TE>
<TE>   Who says they blew it? How about the jury, which voted 10-2 a
month ago to acquit McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   Had jurors split 6-6 or 7-5 or anywhere close, I wouldn't be so
cranky. But 10-2 tells you that prosecutors badly misjudged the
evidence and raises legitimate questions about why he was tried in
the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are supposed to be guided by a legal canon that says
they don't take someone to trial without a "good-faith belief" they
can get a conviction. I'd love to hear their thinking on McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, they had no physical evidence and no plausible
motive. The backbone of the case apparently was that McDonald, an
attorney, had done business with Pang's husband and that, within days
of her murder, McDonald left Orange County for Northern California,
where he faked his suicide. He then lived under various false
identities until his arrest in 2001. Prosecutors argued that the
timing of McDonald's disappearance, which he attributed to a
downward-spiraling life, was just too suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   I'd buy that if anything else linked him to Janie Pang. Otherwise,
he's just a guy who disappeared the week she died.</TE>
<TE>   "In a perfect world," says McDonald's attorney, Michael Molfetta,
"if you're going to prosecute someone for a capital crime, you better
know he did it. I don't think they came anywhere close to proving
that."</TE>
<TE>   I put in a call to Deputy Dist. Atty. Walt Schwarm, who prosecuted
McDonald, in the hopes he'd give me a plausible post-mortem, but
didn't hear back from him.</TE>
<TE>   Molfetta says the fault lies not with Schwarm's handling of the
case but with the decision -- presumably made by more people than
just Schwarm -- to take McDonald to trial. Molfetta lays much of the
blame on the D.A.'s investigators, who, he says, gave prosecutors a
skewed view of the evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Even though McDonald was bound over at a preliminary hearing,
Molfetta says it revealed holes in the case that wouldn't be patched
in a full trial. "There comes a certain point when a prosecutor has
to sit back and realistically evaluate the case he has," Molfetta
says. "I don't think that was done in this case."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the D.A.'s office feels OK because McDonald 'fessed up to
unsavory deeds before and after his departure from Orange County.
Perhaps it thinks he's not very nice and that the four months he
spent in jail after his arrest are no big deal.</TE>
<TE>   But as McDonald had to publicly confess his sins, so should the
D.A.'s office. With flimsy evidence, it tried to send a guy to prison
for life.</TE>
<TE>   Forget the waste of time and money. Ten to two for acquittal.
What's the price tag on the D.A.'s loss of credibility?</TE>

<HD>Family, Politics Converge in Florida</HD>
<DH>As President Bush pushes hard for his brother, the pivotal
state's governor, Bill Clinton goes to bat for the Democrats' choice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>They couldn't be from a more competitive family. They tease one
another about their sports prowess. They even joke about height: Jeb,
who is younger, stands an inch or so taller than his brother, the
president.</LD>
<LD>   But in politics, the family business, they depend on each other.
And though only Jeb is on the ballot this year, seeking reelection as
governor of Florida, President Bush has much at stake in the race.</LD>
<LD>   Before this weekend, he had visited the state six times this year.
On Saturday, his seventh stop found him shoulder to shoulder with his
brother at a rally inside the University of South Florida's Sun Dome
here. To roars of approval, the president said of the crowd's
welcome, and of the support it offered his brother: "You're lifting
his spirits and I appreciate it more than you know."</LD>
<TE>   That may have been an oblique reference to the difficulty facing
the governor's daughter, Noelle, who has struggled with drug
problems.</TE>
<TE>   The governor said he was proud "to see the president of the United
States, my brother, in a leadership position during these difficult
times."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the Democrats campaigning in the state over the
weekend -- among them former President Clinton, Jesse Jackson and
fellow civil rights leader Al Sharpton, he added: "You could multiply
that by 50 and I would take one George W. Bush."</TE>
<TE>   The two, grinning, exchanged brief hugs as the younger Bush
relinquished the lectern to his brother.</TE>
<TE>   It was President Bush's fourth campaign speech of the day as he
carries out a daily blitz on behalf of GOP candidates that will
continue through Monday. He will visit the states with some of the
nation's closest Senate races, including Minnesota, South Dakota,
Missouri and Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   Jeb Bush's opponent is Bill McBride, a trial lawyer who upset
former U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to claim the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination. Recent polls have given Jeb Bush a slight
edge, but McBride remains within striking distance.</TE>
<TE>   Along with obvious personal reasons for wanting his brother to
win, the president has a strong political interest in the outcome.
Winning Florida is often essential to the hopes of GOP presidential
candidates, and in 2004 George Bush wants his brother in the
governor's office for what is likely to be a hard-fought contest for
the state's electoral votes.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get in that voting booth, I've got a suggestion for
you," the president said. "Send Jeb Bush back to Tallahassee....
Jeb's counting on your help and so am I."</TE>
<TE>   For many on both sides of Florida's political fence, this year's
gubernatorial race also is a replay of the bitter recount battle that
decided the 2000 presidential election. And that has galvanized
Democrats too.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton and Al Gore, his vice president and the 2000 Democratic
presidential nominee, have devoted attention to the gubernatorial
race.</TE>
<TE>   Across the state at Miami-Dade Community College, the Democrats
brought out Clinton, who lauded McBride's commitment to civil rights
and equal opportunity during an appearance before a mostly black
audience.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton urged Democrats not to despair, Florida's election
controversies of 2000 and September's Democratic primary
notwithstanding. Those results particularly rankle black voters --
about 11% of the state's electorate -- many of whom believe they were
victims of a Republican plot to disenfranchise them.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to tell everybody you can find between now and Tuesday,
if you don't go this time because of what happened last time, it's
like letting them take your vote away twice," Clinton said to
applause and cheers from the crowd of about 250.</TE>
<TE>   In the Sept. 10 primary, McBride narrowly defeated Reno, the
Democrat preferred by the overwhelming majority of Florida's black
electorate. Since then, McBride has been trying to build bridges to
the black community, and Clinton's appearance was an 11th-hour effort
in that direction.</TE>
<TE>   McBride said at the rally on the Miami campus that the choice
Tuesday is between an incumbent who governs for the few and
well-to-do, and a challenger who will be mindful of even the
neediest.</TE>
<TE>   "I say to the people of Florida, if you like the status quo, if
you think things have been good for the past four years, vote for Jeb
Bush," McBride said. "If you believe in fundamental fairness for
everybody, you'll vote for me."</TE>
<TE>   In his speeches Saturday, President Bush reviewed his
administration's accomplishments at midterm, but he also offered a
preview of the rough road the nation may travel in coming months and
years.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's terrorist attacks, the president told an audience in
Blountville, Tenn., underscored the need for elected officials "who
are clear-eyed realists, people who see the world the way it is, not
the way we would hope it to be."</TE>
<TE>   That is the reason, he said, "why I started the debate in our
Congress and ... in the world community about the threat to America
and threat to our friends and allies from [Iraqi President] Saddam
Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   He also took note of the domestic issue that could undercut his
hopes for a strong GOP showing Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Our economy is bumping along; it's not doing as well as it
should," the president acknowledged. But he sought to place much of
the blame for that on the terrorist attacks. "After all, we're coming
out of a recession, then the enemy hit us."</TE>
<TE>   In the party's weekly radio address, Democrats urged voters to
base their decisions on their concerns about the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been hit hard by the downturn in the economy," said
Tom Strickland, who has a solid shot at defeating Sen. Wayne Allard
(R-Colo.). "If you agree that we need to turn things around, then I
hope on Tuesday that you will join us and start to get our economy
working again for all our families."</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, Republican political veterans readily acknowledge that
a loss by Jeb Bush would provide energy and optimism to Democratic
prospects in the 2004 presidential race.</TE>
<TE>   A new U.S. poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press found President Bush's approval rating had fallen to 59%, the
lowest it has been since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The Democrats would almost trade control of the United States
Senate for knocking off Jeb Bush," said one veteran Republican
political operative of the political effect a Jeb Bush loss would
have on national politics.</TE>
<TE>   But Rich Bond, former chairman of the Republican National
Committee, said it was family loyalty that has brought the president
to the state time and again.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing of all is, it's his brother, his No. 1
political ally," Bond said.</TE>

<HD>Inquiry Into Flight 587 Crash May Take 6 More Months</HD>
<DH>A federal hearing ends without a ruling. The focus remains
on the co-pilot's use of rudder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Malnic and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After more than 11 months of investigation, some 30 hours of
testimony and nearly 3,500 pages of documentation, the biggest
question remains unanswered: Why did an American Airlines Airbus
jetliner crash into a New York neighborhood a year ago?</LD>
<LD>   It's not that a list of suspects hasn't been identified.</LD>
<LD>   The National Transportation Safety Board hearings here last week
focused on the actions of the co-pilot, the sensitivity of the
controls and the training and advance warning given to pilots about
aggressive flight maneuvers. But the board adjourned Friday with a
caution that it could take an additional six months of investigation
before the probable cause is officially determined.</LD>
<TE>   The board usually concludes that multiple factors caused or
contributed to an airplane accident, and the findings on the Nov. 12
crash of American Flight 587 probably will be no exception.</TE>
<TE>   The Airbus A300 jetliner took off without incident from John F.
Kennedy International Airport on a scheduled flight to the Dominican
Republic. About two minutes after that, as it climbed out over
Jamaica Bay, the big jet wobbled slightly as it flew through the wake
generated by one of the wings of a bigger jet ahead of it, a Japan
Air Lines Boeing 747.</TE>
<TE>   Seven seconds later, the Airbus plane wobbled more noticeably as
it encountered the wake from the 747's other wing.</TE>
<TE>   In what may have begun as an effort to compensate for this wobble,
the A300 co-pilot, 1st Officer Sten Molin, apparently pushed hard on
his control pedals, moving the big rudder on the tail sharply to the
right and causing the plane to abruptly jolt sideways.</TE>
<TE>   The rudder is a large movable panel on the tail. It is normally
used only to keep the plane aligned properly on takeoffs and landings
and in extremely rare instances of engine failure.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps trying to compensate for an initial overreaction, Molin
appears to have moved the rudder back to the left. He only succeeded
in making matters worse. He then apparently went right again, then
left, then right one last time, generating such forces that the
plane's tail snapped off. It all happened in 7 1/2 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Flight 587 slammed into a residential neighborhood in Queens,
killing all 260 aboard the plane and five on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's four-day hearing by the NTSB highlighted the design of
the rudder system and the training American gave its pilots on using
that system.</TE>
<TE>   It boiled down to a battle between Airbus, the company that
designed and built the A300, and American, the company that employed
and trained the pilots who flew it. Caught in the middle was Molin,
the man at the controls, and, to a lesser extent, the U.S. and French
officials who had certified the A300 as safe for passenger flight.</TE>
<TE>   The Airbus rudder controls are designed so that it takes less
force on the pedals to apply full rudder at higher speeds than at
lower speeds. Thus the pilot has little indication of how far the
rudder has swung.</TE>
<TE>   Did this design feature confuse Molin, leading him to overreact on
the controls? Should the Federal Aviation Administration and French
air officials have certified this design? Should manufacturers be
expected to anticipate inappropriate control movements? Can any
airplane be expected to withstand the forces generated by such
movements?</TE>
<TE>   A senior American Airlines pilot, John Lavelle, told the NTSB last
summer that five years ago, while flying with Molin, he noticed that
Molin used the rudder too aggressively during a takeoff.</TE>
<TE>   Lavelle said Molin told him that American had trained him to use
the rudder that way, and Airbus contends that American trained its
pilots to rely excessively on the rudder.</TE>
<TE>   American denies this. However, in 1997, four years before the
crash, an American Airlines pilot, David Tribout, expressed concerns
about the way his company's pilots were being trained to use rudders,
saying what they were being taught was "potentially dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, reacting to a turbulence incident involving another A300
flown by American, Airbus warned the NTSB in a memo that rapid
back-and-forth movements of the rudder "can lead to structural loads
that exceed the design load of the [tail] fin and other associated
airframe components."</TE>
<TE>   A copy of the memo was sent to American.</TE>
<TE>   Officials for the NTSB and the carrier say privately that because
there had been no crash owing to tail failure at the time, the memo
was probably filed without attracting much notice. In any event, the
warning about the rudder was not the main subject of the memo. Pilots
were not told about it.</TE>
<TE>   Since the crash of Flight 587, the NTSB has warned all airline
pilots to go easy on the rudder.</TE>
<TE>   The assumption thus far is that the rudder on Flight 587 moved in
response to Molin's pressing on the pedals. There is no evidence thus
far that the control system malfunctioned, causing the rudder to move
on its own.</TE>
<TE>   Some concerns raised early in the investigation now seem to have
been laid largely to rest.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony during the hearing indicated that the composite material
used to build the tail fin was as strong as the metal used on other
planes. It failed only when subjected to stresses far above those
experienced during normal flight. There is no evidence the tail on
Flight 587 had been damaged before the crash.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of the NTSB investigation is of more than academic
interest, especially to Airbus and American. Both companies have
reputations to protect, and public perceptions could have an effect
on the financial futures of each.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there is the question of liability.</TE>
<TE>   A number of lawsuits have been filed on behalf of the families of
the crash victims, and although the total monetary liability has yet
to be decided in the courts, it could well exceed $100 million.
Flight 587 was an international flight, and under international
agreement, punitive damages are not considered.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus and American -- or, more exactly, their insurers -- will
probably pick up most, if not all, of the tab. Despite their
sometimes acrimonious disputes at the hearing, they probably will
eventually sit down quietly together and figure out how to split it.</TE>
<TE>   In most such cases, the award to each litigant is to be determined
through a formula designed to gauge the "value" of each victim. The
computation typically depends on the victim's remaining life
expectancy, earning power, number of dependents and other related
factors.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB isn't interested in any of these monetary concerns, some
of which are resolved before the board issues its final ruling on
proper cause.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's objective is to prevent another similar crash. And to
that end, its investigation will continue, as long as it takes,
probably until sometime next spring.</TE>
<TE>   "We will pursue every lead in our search for answers," board
Chairwoman Carol Carmody said Friday as she closed the hearing.</TE>

<LD>Another strong showing by Oklahoma's defense helped the No. 2 Sooners
avoid the fate of the three teams ranked directly below them.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Brown became the first back in four seasons to gain 100
yards rushing against Oklahoma, but the Sooners forced four turnovers

Tech, No. 4 Notre Dame and No. 5 Georgia all lost Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, the nation's leading rusher at 162.9 yards per game
entering Saturday's contest, needed 25 carries to gain 103 yards on a
cold, sometimes rainy day.</LD>
<TE>   "He's a great player. He deserves his reputation," Oklahoma Coach
Bob Stoops said. "We were fortunate to make our plays a part of the
time. He made his, but in the end to keep them to 11 points is pretty
special."</TE>
<TE>   Brown is the first back to top 100 yards against Oklahoma since
Deuce McAllister of Mississippi did it in the 1999 Independence Bowl,
a span of 33 games.</TE>
<TE>   Nate Hybl threw three touchdown passes, all of them after Colorado
mistakes left the Sooners with a short field. Those three touchdown
drives covered only 39, 24 and nine yards.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Griffin ran for 128 yards in 21 carries and Kejuan Jones
had 82 yards in 20 carries for the Sooners (8-0, 4-0 in conference),
who had been 0-8-1 against Colorado since 1988. In the first half,
Colorado (6-3, 4-1) lost two fumbles, had a pass intercepted, muffed
a pooch kickoff and had a field goal blocked. Oklahoma turned the
mistakes into 17 points to lead 20-3 at halftime, and it could have
been worse.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's first possession of the third quarter ended with an
interception by Oklahoma linebacker Teddy Lehman, who returned it 31
yards to set up Hybl's third touchdown pass, making the score 27-3.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same story all year," defensive tackle Kory Klein said.
"No one is waiting on anyone else. Someone steps up and makes the big
play. That's the kind of defense we have."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado made it 27-11 late in the third quarter on a 12-yard run
by Bobby Purify and a two-point conversion pass. The Buffaloes came
up empty in the fourth after driving to the Oklahoma 23, eight and 10
-- they missed a field goal the first time and turned the ball over
on downs twice.</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 Kansas State 64, Kansas 0 -- Ell Roberson ran for three
touchdowns and threw for another -- all before halftime -- as the
Wildcats (7-2, 3-2) won at Lawrence, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Darren Sproles had 110 yards rushing and two touchdowns for the
Wildcats, who had five touchdown drives of one minute or less and
outgained Kansas (2-8, 0-6), 494-115, in the most lopsided game in
the series' history.</TE>
<TE>   The Jayhawks have not defeated the Wildcats for the Governor's Cup
since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   No. 22 Iowa State 42, Missouri 35 -- Seneca Wallace set a school
record with 493 total yards, but the Cyclones needed Mike Wagner's
one-yard touchdown run with 32 seconds left to help Iowa State win at
Ames, Iowa. Missouri (4-5, 1-4) tied it at 35 when Marcus James
returned a punt 80 yards for a touchdown with 10:26 left --
Missouri's first punt return for a touchdown since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   But Iowa State (7-3, 4-2) got the final score when Wallace
directed a 13-play, 93-yard drive for the winning touchdown. Wallace
completed all four of his passes on the drive for 29 yards and ran
four times for 59 yards, including runs of 33 and 11 yards, before
Wagner scored.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace was 31 for 47 for 425 yards and a touchdown and had 10
carries for 68 yards rushing and another touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State 28, Texas A&amp;M 23 -- Tatum Bell rushed for 143 yards
and three touchdowns and Vernon Grant intercepted a pass in the end
zone with a minute remaining as Oklahoma State held on to win at
Stillwater, Okla. Bell scored from 64, five and two yards for the
Cowboys (4-4, 2-2).</TE>
<TE>   Grant's interception of Dustin Long's pass ended a late Aggie
drive as the Cowboys beat Texas A&amp;M (5-4, 2-3) for the first time
since 1988, a span of six consecutive losses. Long completed 25 of 43
passes for 332 yards, with two touchdowns and two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech 62, Baylor 11 -- Kliff Kingsbury threw for 373 yards
and three touchdowns as Texas Tech gained 654 yards and won easily at
Lubbock, Texas. Reserve quarterback B.J. Symons added three more
touchdowns passes after replacing Kingsbury midway through the third
quarter for Texas Tech (6-4, 3-2). Baylor is 3-6, 1-4.</TE>

<HD>Pittsburgh, Miree Dash Virginia Tech's Hopes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pittsburgh did it again to Virginia Tech, this time taking the team
it wants to emulate out of national championship contention.</LD>
<LD>   Brandon Miree ran 53 yards for a touchdown with 4 minutes 11
seconds remaining, completing Pittsburgh's comeback from a
two-touchdown, third-quarter deficit to help lift the Panthers past
No. 3 Virginia Tech, 28-21, Saturday at Blacksburg, Va.</LD>
<LD>   "You need to pinch me right now," said Miree, who rushed for 161
yards in 23 carries. "I'm still in awe of everything. Virginia Tech
is a great program. I've been watching them for years, and like Coach
[Mike Harris] said, we do idolize this team and this program."</LD>
<TE>   With the victory, the Panthers (7-2, 4-0) moved ahead of the
Hokies (8-1, 3-1) in the Big East race. Pittsburgh hadn't won its
first four conference games since the Big East was formed for
football in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, they handed the Hokies their worst loss in five years,
38-7. The victory was the Panthers' first against a top-five team
since they beat No. 4 Notre Dame in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh plays Temple next Saturday, then has 10 days to prepare
for a Nov. 21 showdown against No. 1 Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working our way up the ladder," Harris said. "To win here
with this crowd, this atmosphere, to be down 14-0 ... to still come
back and win the game, it's almost more than I can fathom."</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh got three touchdown passes from Rod Rutherford to
freshman sensation Larry Fitzgerald and 275 yards rushing against the
nation's best defense against the run (40.75 yards), including
Miree's big run.</TE>
<TE>   On the play, a simple off-tackle run, he burst through the line,
slipped a tackle and ran it in virtually untouched.</TE>
<TE>   The Hokies were done in by their offense, which scored its
touchdowns on first-half drives of three and 21 yards set up by
special teams plays, and on Lee Suggs' 59-yard touchdown run just
after halftime. The Panthers outgained Virginia Tech, 483-275, and
the Hokies committed three turnovers, giving them 10 in three games.
Quarterback Bryan Randall had an interception and a fumble.</TE>
<TE>   "We never really got the momentum today on offense, but you've got
to give the credit to their defense. They did exactly what we thought
they were going to do. It was a matter of executing, and we didn't,"
Randall said.</TE>
<TE>   With 37 seconds left and one last chance to tie, Randall threw
incomplete on first down, was sacked and fumbled out of bounds at the
Hokie six.</TE>
<TE>   Randall then completed a pass to Ernest Wilford at the 39. A
late-hit penalty against Pittsburgh put the Hokies at the Panther 46,
but a final pass for Wilford fell incomplete as time ran out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Syracuse 38, Central Florida 35 --Walter Reyes rushed for a
career-high 130 yards and three touchdowns, including the go-ahead
score in the fourth quarter, to help the Orangemen (2-6) rally from
an 18-point deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Central Florida (3-5), which had 539 yards of total offense, got
within three, and had a chance to tie late. But Steve Gregory, who
also had a fumble recovery, blocked Matt Prater's 47-yard field-goal
attempt -- Syracuse's second block of the game -- to seal the win.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Schneider completed 28 of 47 passes for a school-record 440
yards and a touchdown. Central Florida's previous best was 438 yards,
set by Daunte Culpepper against Louisiana-Lafayette in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia 46, Temple 20 -- Avon Cobourne ran for 94 yards and
two touchdowns and quarterback Rasheed Marshall added 98 yards
rushing and two touchdowns to help West Virginia (6-3, 3-1) win at
Philadelphia. Temple is 3-6, 1-3.</TE>

<HD>Buffalo Wing Man</HD>
<DH>Bledsoe, cast off by Patriots, has made Bills better and
made himself a part of tight-knit community</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Just a simple piece of advice. That's what Jim Kelly had for Drew
Bledsoe when Bledsoe arrived in April, replacing Rob Johnson as
quarterback of the Buffalo Bills. Seeing as how Kelly is not only a
Hall of Fame quarterback but is permanently entrenched as the city's
golden boy, Bledsoe would have been a fool to ignore these three
simple words:</LD>
<LD>   Location, location, location.</LD>
<LD>   Not location of Bledsoe's throws, mind you; he's one of the game's
most accurate passers. Kelly advised him to get comfortable in
Buffalo. Don't be aloof, he urged. Don't give people the impression
you're a high-priced mercenary. This town is about Buffalo wings,
fried baloney sandwiches and "beef on weck" -- roast beef on a salty
kaiser roll. It's about rolling countryside and bitter-cold winters.
Mostly, though, it's about football.</LD>
<TE>   "Western New York is a different place," Kelly explained this
week. "This is a blue-collar area and people expect you to become
part of the community. Move everything here. That's what I did when I
came. Rob came here and lived in hotel rooms during the course of his
career. He didn't listen to me. You've got to show people you want to
be here."</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe was more than happy to get out of New England, where his
services were no longer required. The Patriots, who play at Buffalo
today, had cast their lot with Tom Brady, who took over last season
when Bledsoe went down with a serious chest injury, and helped lead
the franchise to its first championship. Suddenly, Bledsoe, the first
overall pick in the 1993 draft and a three-time Pro Bowl selection,
became the NFL's most overpaid clipboard holder.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe bought a house in East Aurora, an upscale Buffalo suburb
where lots are large and there's a snow blower in just about every
garage.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a small-town kid," said Bledsoe, who grew up in Walla Walla,
Wash.</TE>
<TE>   "Living in a small town like this is a natural fit for me."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, he's in an ideal system, one that's built around his
drop-back style. The Patriots traded him within the division -- pure
insanity, in the estimation of a lot of people -- for a first-round
pick in the 2003 draft. And now, for a number of reasons, the tables
have turned. Brady and the 3-4 Patriots suddenly look very
vulnerable, and Bledsoe is off to the best statistical start of any
quarterback in Bill history.</TE>
<TE>   Through eight games, he leads the league with 2,500 yards passing
and has more than three times as many touchdowns, 16, as
interceptions, five.</TE>
<TE>   At 5-3, the Bills are half a game behind Miami in the AFC East.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe's No. 1 target is Eric Moulds, who leads the NFL in yards
receiving with 785, and has 57 receptions, one fewer than league
leader Marvin Harrison of Indianapolis. Moulds and Peerless Price
form the NFL's top receiving tandem, and fullback Larry Centers is
the NFL's all-time leader in receptions and yards receiving by a
running back. Throw in running back Travis Henry, tight end Jay
Riemersma and rookie receiver Josh Reed, and the Bills have one of
the most potent, versatile offenses in football.</TE>
<TE>   It's quite a change from last season, when the Bills finished 3-13
and, players say, there was constant bickering in the huddle.
Bledsoe, criticized by fans in New England for being too easygoing,
has been much more demonstrative in Buffalo. Not as fiery as Kelly
was, but close.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew coming in there was some talent here, there were a lot of
good players on this team," Bledsoe said. "I also came in with
confidence that we could turn it around very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   He was also encouraged by the league's recent history. The last
three champions -- New England, Baltimore and St. Louis -- failed to
make the playoffs the season before their Super Bowl victories.</TE>
<TE>   As the yards passing and touchdowns pile up in Buffalo, more and
more people are wondering how the Patriots could be so brazen as to
trade Bledsoe within the division.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, 'Go to Cincinnati, man. Do not stay in the division,'
" Miami linebacker Zach Thomas said. "That was ridiculous, you know?
But hopefully it comes back and bites New England."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly was just as incredulous. He quietly wondered if Bledsoe
might be damaged goods, if the Patriots knew something the rest of
the NFL didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard it was going to happen, I said, 'There ain't no
way,' " Kelly said. "[The Patriots] ain't that stupid. I thought, 'Do
they know something we don't?' But they just had so much confidence
in Tom Brady."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say that confidence was misplaced. Quarterback isn't
really the problem for the Patriots, whose most glaring weaknesses
are a battered offensive line and a horrible red-zone defense.</TE>
<TE>   New England Coach Bill Belichick this week defended the decision
to keep Brady over Bledsoe, and said there were no other options but
to trade Bledsoe within the division.</TE>
<TE>   "I made the decisions I felt were in the best interest of the
football team," he said. "There's a million different scenarios that
we can always create, but in the end, there were certain options that
were available and certain options that weren't."</TE>
<TE>   There is no denying Bledsoe has been reborn in Buffalo, although
the memory of losing his job in New England -- or, more accurately,
not getting a chance to win it back -- still courses just below the
surface.</TE>
<TE>   "Having this change, having to go through what I went through last
year and then having a chance to get back on the field, has really
renewed my passion for the game," Bledsoe said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if facing his former team would be just another game for
him, Bledsoe said, "I'd be lying if I said it was. And you'd know I
was lying."</TE>
<TE>   One Buffalo Hall of Famer can appreciate that kind of honesty.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great guy," Kelly said. "He's one of us."</TE>

<TE>   Put-down: Columnist Joe Henderson of the Tampa Tribune was at the
Orlando Magic's opening NBA game and was not impressed by the missing
fans: "The lights bounced off about 2,000 empty seats, testament to
what seems to be increasing indifference to the Magic by this loose
incorporation of strip malls and amusement parks known as a city."</TE>

<TE>   Always the editor: Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel: "Two
friends were walking home after a Halloween party and took a shortcut
through the cemetery. They were startled to see an old man using a
chisel to deface one of the headstones.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Hey, old man,' one of them cried, 'What do you think you're
doing?' Replied the old man: 'Those fools misspelled my name.' ''</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dubious distinction: Dick Jerardi in the Philadelphia Daily News:
"Penn State has to be the best three-loss team in America. Which is
not exactly the kind of praise players and coaches are seeking.</TE>
<TE>   " 'It is obviously hard,' said Coach Joe Paterno. 'It is hard for
me. It is a long plane ride back home. It's nights without sleeping,
thinking about what you could do, should do.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yawn: Jay Leno, commenting on the Angels' victory celebration:
"Today at Disneyland, they celebrated by having a parade down Main
Street. That's something that doesn't happen every day! Boy, how
unusual!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Futility: The New York Giants have scored 89 points in seven
games. Only the Cincinnati Bengals have scored fewer, 75.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Serby of the New York Post calls the Giants' offense "Three
Yards and a Cloud of Bust."</TE>

Runner-up is USC's John McKay, 1960-75, 70-17-23, .794.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nap time: Laker Coach Phil Jackson: "If I hear [Angel Manager]
Mike Scioscia right, he's always talking about 'staying focused.' I
thought they were really able to maintain that focus that is so easy
to lose in baseball because it's such a boring game."</TE>

<TE>   And finally: San Francisco Chronicle reader Joe Arcilla says the

<HD>Kanaan Downplays Pole Position</HD>
<DH>He qualifies first for Toyota 500 at 232.011 mph, then
predicts there will be a lot of lead changes in race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Kupper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>FONTANA</DL>
<LD>Tony Kanaan, the last driver to give it a try, won the pole Saturday
for today's Toyota 500 CART champ car race at California Speedway,
then allowed as how that dramatic gesture probably didn't mean much.</LD>
<LD>   "It feels good and that's it," he said. "But it doesn't help
anything. By Turn 1, I'll probably be third or fourth, but then first
again by Turn 4. It's open for everybody. Anyone can win. I think
there is going to be a lot of passing for sure. I don't want to
predict anything, but I think you'll see a lot of lead changes."</LD>
<LD>   If the race, at 500 miles, CART's longest and its only American
superspeedway event of the nearly completed season, is anything like
last year's, Kanaan may very well be correct.</LD>
<TE>   A year ago, 19 drivers accounted for 73 lead changes in a
late-starting race shortened to 440 miles because of oncoming
darkness. Today's field can't duplicate that, if only because there
won't be 19 drivers competing. There will be 18, though, and at least
the top eight figure to be running at about the same speeds around
the two-mile Fontana track.</TE>
<TE>   And this time around, thanks to a couple of rule changes, the race
may be more a shootout and less an economy run. In the last several
years, because of fuel restraints, drivers were reluctant to lead,
preferring to save fuel by tucking in behind another car and riding
in the draft. Today, however, cars will start with full tanks, then
have 250 gallons of fuel available in the pits, more than enough for
a 500-mile race. And pit stops have been mandated every 33 laps,
which means at least seven stops for any car going the distance. That
may make for complicated scoring, but CART also hopes it makes for
great racing.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody has to worry about the fuel-economy issue anymore, which
is great," said Cristiano da Matta, the recently crowned series
champion, who qualified third.</TE>
<TE>   Old habits may be hard to break, though, for Da Matta also
observed, "You want to be in the front of the pack late, but not
leading."</TE>
<TE>   If it comes down to the last lap, figure on Kanaan playing a key
role. As he took to the track Saturday in his Honda-powered Lola,
fellow Brazilians Bruno Junqueira and Da Matta were at the top of the
list, Junqueira in a Lola-Toyota at 231.145 mph, Da Matta in a
similar car at 230.575.</TE>
<TE>   And Junqueira was mighty happy to be there.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unbelievable," he said. "I almost spun on my second lap.
[The car] was a little loose and that made me nervous, but I just
hung on and held my breath. I really wanted the pole today, but
that's OK."</TE>
<TE>   Kanaan wanted it too, and was slightly better equipped to get it.
It was apparent in his warmup laps that he was going to be fast, then
on his first qualifier, he cranked a lap at 232.011 mph, bumping
Junqueira over to the second spot.</TE>
<TE>   "That was payback for Japan," Kanaan said, alluding to Junqueira's
knocking him off the pole at Motegi, Japan, in April. "I thought I
had the pole won there, but he went after me and beat my time. Today,
it was the other way around and it sure feels good."</TE>
<TE>   The pole was Kanaan's second this season, fourth of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Andretti, driving a Lola-Honda, qualified fourth at
230.532, and Paul Tracy, also in a Lola-Honda, was fifth at 230.176.</TE>
<TE>   Andretti had hoped for better in his last CART superspeedway race.
He is bound for the rival Indy Racing League next season.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we would be a little bit quicker," he said. "I was
hoping to get a lap about 231 mph."</TE>
<TE>   Andretti, CART's leading winner with 42 victories, put himself at
the center of a controversy last weekend in Surfers Paradise,
Australia, when he suggested that CART officials had snookered him
out of a 43rd.</TE>
<TE>   After a wild first-lap crash in the rain, and an hour's delay to
clean up the mess, CART had to cut the 70-lap race short. Ordinarily
in those conditions, races go one lap more than halfway. That would
have been 36 laps at Queensland. Andretti was leading at that point
and would have won had the race been called.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, CART ruled that the race would go 44 laps, so all drivers
could get in two pit stops, then called it after 40 when rain
continued falling. Rookie Mario Dominguez of Mexico was leading by
then and became a first-time winner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame politics had to get into it," Andretti said.</TE>
<TE>   In qualifying here, Dominguez was 17th -- twice. He went out early
in one car and turned a fast lap at 227.141. Then, hoping to move up
the grid, he went out in another car after everyone else had
qualified -- and bumped only himself, hitting 227.644, still ahead of
Oriol Servia but still behind Toranosuke Takagi.</TE>
<TE>   Today's race would seem fertile ground for any political games.
Three of the top five qualifiers are expected to be racing elsewhere
when CART opens the 2003 season.</TE>
<TE>   Kanaan will be joining Andretti on an IRL team next season --
Dario Franchitti is going with them as well -- and Da Matta is
considered 99% certain to be driving for Toyota in Formula One.</TE>

<HD>Kariya, Rucchin Surge Near Top of the Charts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A couple of Mighty Ducks popped up among the NHL leaders the last few
days, which says a lot about the team's improvement.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Kariya has seven goals, one behind league leaders Sergei
Fedorov (Detroit) and Alexei Kovalev (Pittsburgh) through Friday's
games. Steve Rucchin is tied for third with 10 assists and is tied
for ninth with 13 points.</LD>
<LD>   "If your team is going to be good, your best players have to be
good," Coach Mike Babcock said. "I think Rucchin has been great. I
was real happy with Paul's speed the last game. The guys who are
quick, if they can get on the other team's defense, then the other
team doesn't move the puck very good."</LD>
<TE>   Rucchin, sidelined much of the last two seasons because of
injuries, assisted on two of Kariya's three goals Thursday against
Boston. Rucchin had scored more points than Fedorov, Colorado's Joe
Sakic, Carolina's Rod Brind'amour and Philadelphia's Jeremy Roenick,
some of the top centers in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve has been our best player," Kariya said. "It shows a big
reason why we missed the playoffs the last two seasons was we didn't
have him. Getting him back is like signing a restricted free agent
who is still young."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kariya and Rucchin clicked in past seasons with Teemu Selanne.
Patric Kjellberg, their current linemate, is a different type of
player. He is known more for his defensive abilities and being a
checker but has worked out well since being moved to the top line two
games ago.</TE>
<TE>   "[Kjellberg] is a veteran guy," Kariya said. "He plays well
defensively. That's nice for me. I can take more chances out there."</TE>

<TE>   Update -- Adam Oates, who suffered a broken hand against Vancouver
on Oct. 24, will begin skating today but is still two weeks away from
attempting to use a stick during practice. "After that, it will just
be a matter of how much pain I can stand," Oates said.</TE>

<LD>Suppose your team finished the regular season undefeated and was
denied a chance to play for the national championship.</LD>
<LD>   "You'd be screaming bloody murder," Notre Dame Coach Tyrone
Willingham said last week.</LD>
<LD>   Willingham won't have to worry after Notre Dame, in a staggering
display of offensive ineptitude, went belly-up Saturday against
Boston College.</LD>
<TE>   Virginia Tech, Georgia and North Carolina State also suffered
their first losses, to Pittsburgh, Florida and Georgia Tech,
respectively. Suddenly, the road to the national title game doesn't
look so log-jammed.</TE>
<TE>   There were eight undefeated Division I teams before Saturday,
creating a potentially troubling scenario for the bowl championship
series, which matches the top two teams in a national championship
game -- this year it's the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   But only four undefeated teams remain, and one of them, Bowling
Green, is not a realistic contender because it plays outside of BCS
consideration in the Mid-American Conference.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves Oklahoma, Miami and Ohio State. Oklahoma and Miami
occupy the top two spots in the BCS rankings and have the best chance
of meeting for the national title if they win out. That could leave
an unbeaten Ohio State on the outside, with the Buckeyes having to
settle for a spot in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   History would indicate that someone else will stumble. Since the
BCS system started in 1998, there have never been more than two major
undefeated teams at the end of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, BCS coordinator Michael Tranghese is preaching
patience. "The BCS poll still determines who plays in the national
championship game," said Tranghese, Big East commissioner. "And, yes,
there will be controversy. But this is the system."</TE>

<TE>   He Forgot His Rally Monkey</TE>
<TE>   Dusty Baker enjoyed his first visit to the Notre Dame campus, but
he might have to wait awhile to be invited back.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, manager of the San Francisco Giants, addressed the Notre
Dame pep rally Friday night. Then he and his father, Johnnie Baker
Sr., watched Saturday's game as guests of Willingham. The Irish
promptly lost, 14-7, to Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, I feel bad," Baker said. "I didn't go here and I don't coach
here, but I feel bad. I wish they could have won."</TE>

<TE>   Spartans Get Smoked</TE>
<TE>   Michigan got rid of the bad taste from last year's controversial
loss to Michigan State by pounding the Spartans, 49-3, at Ann Arbor.</TE>
<TE>   In handing Michigan State its worst defeat since 1947, the
Wolverines avenged last season's 26-24 loss that was marred by
questionable timekeeping at the finish.</TE>
<TE>   With no timeouts, Michigan State quarterback Jeff Smoker scrambled
to the Michigan two and spiked the ball to stop the clock and set up
a final play. Replays showed that the clock should have expired, but
officials ruled that one second remained, allowing Smoker to throw a
game-winning, two-yard touchdown pass to T.J. Duckett.</TE>
<TE>   "It was on my mind a lot during spring ball and two-a-days," said
Michigan running back B.J. Askew, who rushed for a career-best 149
yards in 32 carries and scored two touchdowns. "That made it even
more important for us to win this one."</TE>
<TE>   Said Wolverine cornerback Marlin Jackson: "There was no
controversy this year, just a straight-up whipping."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the controversy leading up to Saturday's game centered on
Smoker, who was indefinitely suspended Oct. 24 for breaking an
unspecified team rule. The suspension led to a barrage of
unsubstantiated reports that Smoker was in trouble with the law.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State, meanwhile, appears to be playing out the string
after losing for the sixth time in its last seven games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too late for a turnaround," said Charles Rogers, the
Spartans' standout receiver. "We'll be lucky if we win another game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the End, a Hart-Breaker</TE>
<TE>   From the mouths of babes....</TE>
<TE>   Before making his first start for Rutgers, freshman quarterback
Ryan Hart made it clear he wasn't intimidated about facing No. 1
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got weaknesses just like any other team in the country,
and we're going to capitalize on them," Hart said.</TE>
<TE>   What sounded like a brash prediction became a startling reality
when lowly Rutgers took a 17-14 lead into the fourth quarter, before
Miami rallied for a 42-17 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "For three quarters, we led the No. 1 team in the country,"
Rutgers Coach Greg Schiano said. "When we figure out how to do it for
four quarters, then we'll be the No. 1 team in the country someday."</TE>
<TE>   Rutgers still has a ways to go. The Scarlet Knights had their Big
East losing streak extended to 20 games, while Miami pushed its
overall winning streak to 30, a school record. The Hurricanes have
never lost to Rutgers, winning the last three games by a combined
score of 167-23.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Passing Into History</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps only an injury can stop Texas Tech quarterback Kliff
Kingsbury, who continued his assault on the record book in a 62-11
victory over Baylor.</TE>
<TE>   Kingsbury passed for 373 yards and three touchdowns, moving to
eighth on the NCAA career passing list with 10,969 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Kingsbury, who was hobbled slightly by an injured right ankle in
the first quarter, completed 34 of 41 passes with three interceptions
to break the Division I-A record for career passing attempts. He has
1,696, 17 more than Louisville's Chris Redman.</TE>
<TE>   B.J. Symons replaced Kingsbury midway through the third quarter
and added three more touchdown passes for the Red Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Better Luck Next Time</TE>
<TE>   With a minute left in the first half, Columbia Coach Ray Tellier
chose to run on fourth and one from the Columbia 45.</TE>
<TE>   "We're 1-5, we were down 14-0," Tellier said. "If we can't make
half a yard, we're not going to win the game anyway."</TE>
<TE>   That's right, Coach.</TE>
<TE>   Yale stopped Dan Reed for a two-yard loss, then scored with 13
seconds left in the half to take a 21-0 lead en route to a 35-7 Ivy
League victory.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Columbia is 1-6.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quick Kicks</TE>
<TE>   * Jason Wright, a graduate of Diamond Bar High, rushed for a
career-best 219 yards and four touchdowns to help Northwestern end a
five-game losing streak with a 41-37 victory over Indiana. With 1,106
yards, Wright is only the eighth Northwestern player to rush for
1,000 yards in a season.</TE>
<TE>   * Quarterbacks Seneca Wallace of Iowa State and Brad Smith of
Missouri each set school total offense records in the Cyclones' 42-35
victory. Wallace set a game record with 493 yards. Smith, a redshirt
freshman, had 318 yards to set a season mark of 2,683 yards.</TE>
<TE>   * Robbie Mixon rushed for 377 yards to set a Mid-American
Conference record and scored four touchdowns for Central Michigan in
a 47-21 victory over Eastern Michigan. Mixon, who had 43 carries,
surpassed the previous record of 376 yards set by Travis Prentice of
Miami of Ohio against Akron in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Barrera Gets In Jabs for Win</HD>
<DH>He methodically batters Tapia to earn unanimous decision in
a nontitle fight that matched top featherweights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Dwyre</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS -- Johnny Tapia had the heart of a champion, but the other
guy had a better jab, better body, better technique and a better game
plan.</LD>
<LD>   And so the so-called Battle of the Warriors, a match between two
of the more appealing featherweights to ever lace up the gloves, was
won Saturday night by Marco Antonio Barrera. The unanimous decision
was greeted by scattered jeers from those in the crowd of 7,707 in
the MGM Grand Garden who watched with their hearts and not with their
eyes.</LD>
<LD>   Barrera, of Iztacalco, Mexico, at 28 seven years younger than
Tapia, weighed the same 126 pounds as the veteran from Albuquerque
but looked stronger and sturdier and basically won with a jab that
snapped Tapia's head back repeatedly.</LD>
<TE>   Strength and body shape weren't the only differences in these two.
Barrera went about his business with an expressionless calm unusual
in the middle of a 12-round brawl. He moved and jabbed and danced and
jabbed and said afterward, "My corner told me to jab and counter, to
make sure there were no accidents."</TE>
<TE>   And there were none, even though Tapia, who resembles a 6-year-old
on a sugar high, bobbed and weaved and wiggled and squirmed and
smiled and grimaced and generally looked like somebody who just had a
garter snake slipped into his pants.</TE>
<TE>   None of it mattered. Barrera was better and earned his $1-million
payday in a fight that had no alphabet boxing organization title on
the line. Barrera walked away from his World Boxing Council title to
fight Tapia, rather than the top WBC contender. Tapia, who got
$750,000 for his efforts, did the same with his International Boxing
Federation title.</TE>
<TE>   Tapia, who was at his best at about 115 pounds and won several
world titles there, seemed a tad small for Barrera, whose record is
now 56-3. Tapia, who may be beyond the twilight of his career and
heading toward midnight, is now 52-3-2. The statistical difference
told the story: Barrera threw 800 punches, landed 323 and connected
on 179 of his 467 jabs. Tapia threw 509 punches, connected on just
124 and landed only 17 of the 221 jabs he tried.</TE>
<TE>   Tapia, who is a proclaimed Barrera fan and friend, who called
himself a "99-1 longshot" going into the fight, said afterward, "It
took me a while to get into the fight, but once I did, and started to
move my head, I thought I was able to find a way to be effective."</TE>
<TE>   In the match just before the main event, Olympian Ricardo Williams
took an impressive unanimous decision over Terronn Millett.</TE>

<HD>Ohio State, Iowa Maintain the Edge</HD>
<DH>No. 9 Hawkeyes stay unbeaten in conference as Banks,
defense lead 20-3 win over Wisconsin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>IOWA CITY, Iowa</DL>
<LD>Maybe Iowa quarterback Brad Banks will finally get noticed. Even on
his own campus.</LD>
<LD>   Banks completed 17 of 30 passes for 275 yards and two touchdowns
as the ninth-ranked Hawkeyes maintained their lead in the Big Ten
with a 20-3 victory over Wisconsin on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Banks is a big reason the Hawkeyes are 9-1 overall, a half-game
ahead of Ohio State in the Big Ten standings at 6-0, and have a
chance to reach the Rose Bowl for the first time in 12 years. Yet the
senior isn't as recognizable as some of the star players from other
top 10 teams.</LD>
<TE>   "People still don't notice me around here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his passing, Banks ran for 36 yards and made two
play-fakes that helped get his receivers open for touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely not trading Brad Banks for anybody," said Coach
Kirk Ferentz. "He's done a great job of leading our football team."</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin (6-4, 1-4) had beaten Iowa five consecutive times, but
the Badgers struggled on offense all day.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Brooks Bollinger was injured late in the first half
and didn't return. He was two of nine passing for 46 yards and had
only six yards rushing. Running back Anthony Davis was held to 34
yards in 16 carries, and Wisconsin gained only 215 total yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We go out and play hard-nosed defense," said Iowa defensive
lineman Colin Cole. "We came in trying to stop the run, and I think
we did that pretty well today."</TE>

<HD>Irish Look Unsightly in Green</HD>
<DH>Wearing "lucky" jerseys for first time at home since 1985,
Notre Dame loses three fumbles, suffers first loss of year, 14-7, to
Boston College.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SOUTH BEND, Ind.</DL>
<LD>We may never fully understand why Notre Dame, smack-dab in a national
title race with the 107th-rated offense, thought Saturday was the
right day to break out the "lucky" green jerseys at home for the
first time since 1985.</LD>
<LD>   As if this season hadn't been magical enough? The Irish wanted
more luck?</LD>
<LD>   These and other questions would be asked in the wake of Boston
College's 14-7 upset of No. 4 Notre Dame before a record 80,935 at
Notre Dame Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   The defeat dropped the Irish to 8-1 and might have wrecked their
national title hopes. Boston College improved to 5-3 while ending a
23-game, regular-season losing streak against ranked opponents.</TE>
<TE>   The jerseys?</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a great time," Irish Coach Tyrone Willingham
said of the unveiling.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the way the Irish handled the ball, fumbling seven
times and losing three, it appeared someone greased the green jerseys
with slime.</TE>
<TE>   Surely, Irish players were well versed in Boston College's history
of being giant killers. Let's see, there was Doug Flutie's pass to
beat Miami in 1984 and, closer to home, a 41-39 victory over No. 1
Notre Dame in 1993, the week after the Irish upset Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the morning line and the number of people who thought the
Eagles had a chance, maybe Boston College should have worn green.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Notre Dame's plan backfired, and it all started in
the backfield.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, I thought our kids were excited when they saw the green
jerseys," Boston College Coach Tom O'Brien said.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of a season in which virtually nothing has gone
wrong, Notre Dame somehow found a way to motivate its opponent, the
Eagles, who borrowed the script the Irish have used all year to
scrape out victories.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College used two Irish turnovers to build a 14-0 lead and
then withstood Notre Dame's last-gasp effort to keep its perfect
season.</TE>
<TE>   The bobble-fest started in the first quarter, when Notre Dame
quarterback Carlyle Holiday botched a handoff exchange with Ryan
Grant and Boston College's Josh Ott jumped on the fumble at the Irish
38. Six plays later, the Eagles landed in the end zone on Derrick
Knight's three-yard scoring run, the lead holding at 6-0 when the
extra point was missed.</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter, with Holiday temporarily out of the game
with a slight head injury, backup quarterback Pat Dillingham, under
pressure, flipped an ill-advised back-handed pass that Ott picked out
of the air and returned 71 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Brian St. Pierre's pass to Sean Ryan on the two-point attempt made
it 14-0.</TE>
<TE>   What luck came with those green jerseys?</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame dominated most of the game, outgaining Boston College
in total yards, 357-184, but committed five turnovers and even got
robbed when an official incorrectly ruled Irish receiver Omar Jenkins
out of bounds in the end zone on an apparent second-quarter scoring
pass.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, I don't know why they didn't call it a touchdown,"
Jenkins said. "I had it in control."</TE>
<TE>   That opportunity lost, Notre Dame spent the rest of the game
handling the ball as if it were a bar of soap. Most of the seven
fumbles were unforced errors, the cough-ups coming either on a bad
exchange or, in the case of one Grant fumble, the ball just falling
out of his arms as he approached the line of scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   "It just goes on the ground over and over and over again," Notre
Dame receiver Arnaz Battle said of the bouncing ball.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what went wrong, Battle said, "I can't put my finger on it."</TE>
<TE>   The real problem with the ball was Irish players couldn't keep
five fingers on it.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Battle said, "There wasn't one point in the game I didn't
think we couldn't win."</TE>
<TE>   And darn if Notre Dame didn't make it interesting in the end. The
Irish finally scored a touchdown that counted with 2:25 left, when
Holiday scrambled out of the pocket and threw a scoring strike to
Maurice Stoval in the corner of the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame trailed, 14-7, and had two timeouts left, so Willingham
decided against an on-side kick in the hope his defense could hold.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed a good bet, but it didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   With 2:16 left, Boston College situated at its own 28, and
everyone in the stadium knowing the Eagles were going to run the ball
and force the Irish to burn their last two timeouts, Knight rushed
for four and nine yards in two carries to get a first down.</TE>
<TE>   It was, perhaps, the first time this season the Notre Dame defense
did not come up big when needed.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone built them up to be everything in the world," Knight,
who finished with 133 yards in 26 carries, said of the Irish. "But I
looked at the tape, and those were the same guys we beat three out of
the last four years."</TE>
<TE>   Boston College pushed the ball to midfield before finally having
to punt, pinning the Irish on their own 23 with 12 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Two incompletions later, Notre Dame's perfect season had ended.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hurt, I'm disappointed, because I felt it didn't have to
happen," Willingham said of his first defeat suffered as Notre Dame
coach. "But that's competition, that's athletics."</TE>
<TE>   After the victory, Boston College players danced their way off the
field, some trying to pry chunks of turf from Notre Dame Stadium. Two
Eagles, Ott and Doug Bessette, knelt near the goal line and said a
prayer as a small but boisterous group of Boston College fans smacked
together yellow noise sticks in a section near the scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   With a win, the Irish probably would have surpassed Miami for the
No. 2 spot in this week's bowl championship series standings and
could have been perhaps three victories away from a spot in the
national title game at the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "Things like this happen," Holiday, the losing quarterback,
reasoned. "But all of our goals are still attainable."</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins, the receiver who thought he had caught a touchdown pass,
put the loss in perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't finished on a team that finished 11-1," Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Ever?</TE>
<TE>   "Ever."</TE>

<LD>The Kings started Saturday night's game against Nashville with the
second best penalty-killing unit in the NHL, giving up only five
power-play goals in 59 short-handed situations.</LD>
<LD>   But the Kings sure had their problems stopping the Predators'
power play in the first period. Nashville scored twice in four

accounting for the goals. It was the first time this season that an

<HD>Deadmarsh Leaves No Doubts</HD>
<DH>Forward, who wasn't sure he would play because of wrist
injury, gets two goals and one assist in Kings' 6-5 overtime win over
Predators.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Adam Deadmarsh's sprained right wrist was bothering him Saturday
night against Nashville, you couldn't tell from the two goals and one
assist he had in the Kings' 6-5 overtime victory at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Deadmarsh, who was listed as questionable after sitting out the
Kings' overtime loss at Chicago on Thursday, scored his sixth and
seventh goals of the season and defenseman Jaroslav Modry scored two
goals, including the game-winner for the Kings in front of a sellout
crowd of 18,118.</LD>
<LD>   Deadmarsh, who has six goals in his last four games, said the
absence of injured center Jason Allison had nothing to do with his
decision to play.</LD>
<TE>   "I just want to be in the lineup as much as possible and felt this
morning that I would be able to go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who improved to 6-2-2-1, also received a big game from
rookie Alexander Frolov, who scored two goals to help overcome an off
game for goaltender Felix Potvin, who stopped 23 of 28 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "We came back from the road trip and wanted to play a tight
defensive game and tonight was totally opposite of what we were
looking for," said Modry, who has scored all three of his goals this
season in the last two games. "It was just a crazy game, but it had a
good ending. We finished with one more goal than them and that's what
counts."</TE>
<TE>   To say that the Predators were struggling before Saturday's game
would be an understatement. Nashville had won only one of its first
nine games and was coming off an embarrassing 7-0 loss at St. Louis
on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But the Predators started fast against the Kings, highlighted by a
productive power play that scored two goals in four man-advantage
situations during the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville forward David Legwand scored the first goal only 1
minute 50 seconds into the game when he found himself open in the
slot and beat Potvin for his third score of the season.</TE>
<TE>   That set the stage for Deadmarsh's first goal of the game on a
nifty redirect off a blue-line shot by Bryan Smolinski to beat
Nashville goaltender Mike Dunham at 15:52. What made Deadmarsh's
score so impressive was that he had to fully extend his arm to reach
the puck.</TE>
<TE>   After Andreas Johansson gave the Predators a 2-1 lead when his
shot deflected off Potvin, who knocked the puck into the net himself
with 51 seconds remaining in the period, the Kings dominated the
second period. They got goals from Deadmarsh and Modry.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kings could not keep their 3-2 lead in a third period,
which featured five goals.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville regained the lead by scored goals 61 seconds apart.
Predator winger Vladimir Orszagh tied the score, then Legwand put
Nashville back on top with his second goal of the game at 4:12.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kings answered with Frolov's first goal of the game when
he picked up a bouncing rebound off a shot by Deadmarsh at 6:29.
However, the Predators scored again on a power-play goal by Adam Hall
at 11:22 before Frolov finished the scoring in regulation with
another rebound goal at 13:15.</TE>
<TE>   In overtime, the Kings finally put the Predators away when Modry
fired home his power-play goal 1:45 into the extra period.</TE>
<TE>   "We obviously don't win many games when we play like we did
tonight, but we found a way," King Coach Andy Murray said. "And
that's the most important thing."</TE>

<LD>If it were any other game, Coach Don Morel would have been bitterly
disappointed with the outcome.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of coaches wouldn't be too excited about losing
33-to-whatever to a team that started the day 0-6," Morel said. "With
all we've been through, I'm thrilled."</LD>
<LD>   Morel's La Verne football team on Saturday played for the first
time since Rollie Dykstra, the Leopards' starting senior quarterback,
suffered a serious head injury when he was tackled in an Oct. 19 game
against Redlands.</LD>
<TE>   Whittier pounded the Leopards as Poet quarterback Mark Mejia threw
four first-half touchdown passes and led the hosts to a 33-12 victory
at Chief Newman Memorial Field.</TE>
<TE>   Whittier improved to 1-6 overall, 1-2 in the Southern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.</TE>
<TE>   La Verne (1-5, 0-4) didn't score until 14:35 remained in the
fourth quarter. Running back Justin Wolfchief's touchdown came on a
10-yard carry. With 4:21 left in the game, Gabe Lujan, Dykstra's
replacement at quarterback, tossed an eight-yard touchdown pass to
receiver Michael Raffee.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a tough game to play in, because Rollie's a good friend
of mine," Lujan said. "It was one of those things where you just had
to fight through a lot of the thoughts running through your head."</TE>
<TE>   Lujan completed 13 of 22 passes for 197 yards. Two of his passes
were intercepted. Lujan started the season as the Leopard
quarterback, but two games ago moved to wide receiver in favor of
Dykstra, a 24-year-old from Redlands who had last attended Florida
A&amp;M.</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra remains comatose and in serious condition at Pomona Valley
Hospital Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We were thinking about other things in the first half -- Rollie,
of course," offensive lineman Jacob Round said of the Leopards, who
canceled their scheduled nonconference game against Azusa Pacific on
Oct. 26. "In the second half, we paid attention to the task at hand."</TE>
<TE>   Said Morel: "We think about Rollie Dykstra every minute of every
day. Today, it was good just to play."</TE>

<DL>PISCATAWAY, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The Miami Hurricanes are making a habit of playing close games.
Whether the latest one hurts them in the polls remains to be seen.</LD>
<LD>   For the third consecutive game, the top-ranked Hurricanes had to
rally to win. Lowly Rutgers put a fright into them on Saturday,
taking a 17-14 lead into the fourth quarter before Ken Dorsey led
them to a 42-17 Big East Conference victory.</LD>
<LD>   Despite injuring his non-throwing hand, Dorsey completed a 20-yard
touchdown pass to Andre Johnson early in the fourth quarter, then
added a one-yard touchdown pass to Kellen Winslow.</LD>
<TE>   The Hurricanes added two more touchdowns in the final eight
minutes to push their winning streak to 30, a school record.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we ever thought we were going to lose the football
game," Miami Coach Larry Coker said.</TE>
<TE>   Willis McGahee added 187 yards rushing and two scores for Miami
(8-0, 4-0 Big East), which struggled for three quarters against the
Scarlet Knights (1-8, 0-5), much like it did against West Virginia
and Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   Miami broke the school record for consecutive victories set by
Dennis Erickson's teams from 1990-92.</TE>

<LD>Championship Auto Racing Teams, an organization beset recently by
driver and sponsor defections, got some good news, for a change,
Saturday when Bridgestone tires announced it was signing on as
presenting sponsor for next season.</LD>
<LD>   Bridgestone has been the sole supplier of racing tires for CART
this season and will continue in that role next season.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a significant development for us," said Chris Pook,
CART's president and chief executive. Federal Express will not be
back next season; it has been the series title sponsor since 1998,
and Pook said a replacement was being sought. He added that
Bridgestone, as a presenting sponsor, would not be required to make
as great an investment as a title sponsor.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd like to remind you that a presenting sponsor comes first,"
said Al Speyer, executive director of Bridgestone Motorsports.
"That's very important to us, to be first in line."</TE>
<TE>   So, although CART's new series title remains to be determined,
depending on how successful it is in finding a title sponsor, that
title apparently will begin with, "Bridgestone Presents ... "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Brack has no answers. At least, none that he's revealing.</TE>
<TE>   The 1999 Indianapolis 500 winner knows he will drive an open wheel
car next season, and that he won't be driving for Chip Ganassi. He's
saying nothing more than that.</TE>
<TE>   "There's the driver, team, sponsor and sometimes the engine
manufacturer, and no one wants to talk about it until it's time to
make the announcement," Brack said. "I'd tell you if I could."</TE>
<TE>   One thing Brack doesn't have to reveal is his level of
frustration, because it's obvious. He is in 10th place in the
standings.</TE>
<TE>   Brack's average qualifying position is 6.3, and he has started in
the front two rows nine times in the first 17 races. He starts 15th
among 18 drivers today in the Toyota 500 at California Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at that, we should be fighting for the championship,"
Brack said. "We're third in laps led, but in laps completed, we're
basically last. That's a terrible statistic.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fast, competitive, but we can't finish races."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Injured driver/owner Adrian Fernandez dispelled speculation that
his hand was being forced by sponsors to use Mexican driver Luis Diaz
as a replacement if Fernandez is unable to compete in the Mexico City
race on Nov. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez's sponsorship comprises mostly Mexican companies.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives us a chance to see into the future," Fernandez said.
"It just fits. If I retire one day, Luis may be able to take my
place.</TE>
<TE>   "Max [Papis] has done a great job, but Mexico's another case. I've
been wanting to test [Diaz] for a while."</TE>

<LD>Jamie McMurray's great luck continued Saturday with his second
consecutive Busch series victory, achieved because leaders Jeff Green
and Michael Waltrip wrecked each other with one lap to go in the
Sam's Club 200 at Rockingham, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   McMurray was running third, watching Green and Waltrip battle for
the lead ahead of him with three laps to go, when Waltrip tried to
bang Green out of his way. The cars hit and went into a spin, and
McMurray coasted to victory.</LD>
<LD>   McMurray earned his first Busch victory last week at Atlanta Motor
Speedway after leader Joe Nemechek ran out of gas on the last lap.</LD>
<TE>   "I cannot believe the luck we've had," McMurray said. "Once again
we did not have the best car. But we had a top-five car and we were
in the right place at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Greg Biffle finished second to give him a 212-point lead in the
Busch standings over Jason Keller with two races to go -- enough of a
margin to almost guarantee him the title.</TE>
<TE>   Randy LaJoie finished third, followed by David Green, Stacy
Compton, Jeff Green and Waltrip.</TE>

<HD>Musgrave Aims for Win, Gets It</HD>
<DH>His second American Racing Wheels 200 victory in a row puts
him 107 points behind the series leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>FONTANA</DL>
<LD>Makes no difference to Ted Musgrave, if he is going to race a truck
at California Speedway, he is going to win. The former Winston Cup
driver aced the field Saturday, winning the NASCAR Craftsman Truck
Series' American Racing Wheels 200 for the second year in a row.</LD>
<LD>   Musgrave, who qualified 11th but was moved toward the back of the
field because he changed engines before Friday qualifying, led the
final 29 laps. He started 30th among 36 drivers and took the lead on
Lap 26 of the 100-lap race around the two-mile California Speedway.
He led a race-high 51 laps.</LD>
<LD>   Musgrave's teammate, Jason Leffler of Long Beach, finished second,
giving Ultra Motorsports team owner Jim Smith a 1-2 finish with his
Dodge Rams. Smith owns Ultra Wheels, the business rival of the race's
presenting sponsor. "He's got to be gloating," said Leffler, who is
fifth in the truck series.</LD>
<TE>   It was Musgrave's third victory of the season, but his first in 14
races. He won two of the first six events, but had been on the podium
only twice since winning at Dover, Del., on May 31. "I had a very
good truck when we unloaded," Musgrave said. "We worked on a race
setup while everyone else was working on qualifying. That's why we
didn't qualify very well. We knew right away, when Happy Hour
started, we were right at the top of the board and stayed there.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to win the race. To win the pole is fine and dandy
but to win the race pays the most points." With his victory, Musgrave
remained in third place in the series, but closed from 149 points to
107 behind leader Mike Bliss, who finished ninth in his Chevrolet.</TE>
<TE>   Leffler has finished second six times this season; he has yet to
win. The race average was 140.296 mph, the fifth-fastest in series
history. Musgrave beat Leffler by 1.603 seconds. It could have been
more.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end with six, seven laps to go, I eased up and didn't
pressure the truck," Musgrave said. "You got that big of a lead, the
worst thing in the world is [to] screw up and lose the race." He got
the big lead because he was in front when the caution came out for
oil on the track. There was so much Quick-Dry laid down across three
grooves during the 12-lap caution, it made the racing tenuous.</TE>
<TE>   "We wasted five or six laps [on the caution], then it took three
more laps to get the tires clean," said Brendan Gaughan, the series'
leading rookie who finished third to give Dodge a sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Gaughan finished ahead of Travis Kvapil, Rick Crawford, Coy Gibbs
and Robert Pressley, who led 17 laps. Crawford is second in the

<HD>Singh Putts His Way to Three-Stroke Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vijay Singh was in familiar territory Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   With an 80-foot eagle putt that left him feeling as if he were in
the Twilight Zone, Singh blew away Tiger Woods and the rest of his
challengers to build a three-stroke lead in the Tour Championship at
Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   It was the third consecutive time Singh has held at least a share
of the 54-hole lead at East Lake, only this time he has some
breathing room.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a lot better than going out with a one-shot lead," Singh
said after a five-under-par 65 gave him a comfortable margin over
Charles Howell III.</TE>
<TE>   Singh can thank No. 15 for that, a par five with a green he knows
all too well.</TE>
<TE>   Clinging to a one-stroke lead over Woods, Singh reached the
495-yard uphill hole with a five iron that stopped 80 feet beyond the
flag.</TE>
<TE>   "It was weird, because where my ball was, that's where the pin was
yesterday," he said. "And where the pin was, my ball was there
yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   He three-putted for par Friday. He made the eagle putt Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew the line," Singh said with a laugh. "I was glad to see it
go in."</TE>
<TE>   Singh was at nine-under 201 and can only hope his third chance at
winning the season-ending Tour Championship is successful.</TE>
<TE>   His most probable challenge figures to come from Howell, who kept
in the hunt with an aggressive birdie on No. 17 for a 69, making him
the only player in the 30-man field to break par at East Lake in all
three rounds.</TE>

<HD>Bertuzzi Gets Canucks Off to a Wild Start</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It only took a little more than a minute for the Vancouver Canucks to
put away the Minnesota Wild.</LD>
<LD>   Todd Bertuzzi scored the first of three goals in a 1:08 span of
the first period and the Canucks defeated the Wild, 4-2, Saturday
night at St. Paul, Minn.</LD>
<LD>   Bertuzzi had two assists to help the Canucks hand the Wild its
second loss in 12 games this season. The defeat ended a six-game
unbeaten streak for Minnesota, which is tied with Philadelphia for
the most points in the league, each with 18.</LD>
<TE>   "We stuck to our game plan," Bertuzzi said. "Instead of sitting
around and not doing anything about it, we went right out and got
one."</TE>
<TE>   Marion Gaborik opened the scoring with his seventh goal 8:04 in,
and the game had the feel of another Wild victory.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be careful when a team gets [the first] goal,"
Minnesota Coach Jacques Lemaire said. "The line that takes over at
that point needs to keep the pressure on and play in their end. It
didn't work out that way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Tampa Bay 3 -- Mario Lemieux scored one goal and set
up three others, and Kent Manderville broke a tie with 3:30 to play
at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei Kovalev scored two power-play goals for Pittsburgh to
extend his scoring streak to 10 games and give him 10 goals in the
last eight games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Toronto 2 -- Oleg Petrov and Richard Zednik each
scored twice to lead the Canadiens to their first victory at
Toronto's Air Canada Center.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Hackett made 30 saves for the Canadiens, who last won in
Toronto on Dec. 26, 1998, the final game between the Original Six
rivals at Maple Leaf Gardens.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 6, New York Islanders 1 -- Scott Mellanby and Cory
Stillman each had a goal and an assist at Uniondale, N.Y., and the
Blues won their seventh consecutive game, spoiling the return of
Islander captain Michael Peca.</TE>
<TE>   Peca played for the first time since tearing a knee ligament April
26.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 4, Calgary 4 -- Martin Gelinas scored twice, including
the tying goal, to give Colorado a tie at Calgary, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   A harmless-looking wrist shot from the blue line by Calgary
defenseman Robyn Regehr was going wide of the net when Gelinas stuck
out his stick and deflected the puck past Patrick Roy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, New York Rangers 2 -- Brian Berard scored on a deflected
shot with 38.8 seconds to play at Boston, where the Bruins rallied
from a two-goal deficit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 5, Detroit 2 -- Patrick Lalime made 20 saves at Ottawa and
the Senators ended a four-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 2, Washington 1 -- Dennis Seidenberg and Keith
Primeau scored at Philadelphia, leading the Flyers to their fifth
consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 5, Chicago 1 -- Jamie Langenbrunner got the Devils
going with a goal 10 seconds into the game at East Rutherford, N.J.,
and scored another goal later in the period.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3, Florida 1 -- Frantisek Kaberle and Tony Hrkac scored
third-period goals at Sunrise, Fla., to help the Thrashers end a
19-game winless streak.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Ohio State's defense appreciates being tested.</LD>
<LD>   "We knew that Minnesota was in the top 10 in the nation as far as
running the ball and we didn't want those guys to control the clock,"
two-time All-American strong safety Michael Doss said after the
sixth-ranked Buckeyes defeated No. 23 Minnesota, 34-3, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "We decided to take that as a challenge."</LD>
<TE>   There were plenty of offensive standouts for Ohio State, 10-0
overall and 5-0 in the conference. Lydell Ross ran for two
touchdowns. Chris Vance caught a 30-yard touchdown pass from Craig
Krenzel. Mike Nugent kicked two field goals to set a school record
with 20 this season and extend his overall mark to 21 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the defense that controlled the game, holding Minnesota
to only 112 yards while running its streak without giving up a
touchdown to 10 quarters.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Gophers (7-2, 3-2) came in averaging 271 yards rushing
but finished with only 53 yards in 36 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that we'd have a tough go running against these guys,"
Minnesota Coach Glen Mason said.</TE>
<TE>   Darrion Scott had two sacks and David Thompson had two tackles for
losses.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State improved to 10-0 for the first time since 1996 and the
10th time in school history.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been 10-0 in anything," free safety Donnie Nickey
said. "Knowing that we can get to where we set out to go is
exciting."</TE>

<HD>USOC Turns to New York</HD>
<DH>The city beats out San Francisco, now faces international
contenders for 2012 Summer Olympics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.</DL>
<LD>New York, pitching the power of a transforming dream and asking not
for pity or sympathy but for a chance to make that dream come true,
was selected Saturday as the U.S. candidate to play host to the
Summer Olympics in 2012, trumping San Francisco and the notion of a
"low-risk, value proposition" Games.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Olympic Committee's board of directors picked New York in
a complicated and weighted ballot, giving it 132.02 out of 223.038
votes, wrapping up a domestic bid-city process that over the last two
years had seen Los Angeles and five other cities eliminated.</LD>
<LD>   Now New York, which was portrayed in a star-filled presentation to
USOC voters as a place where courage, resilience and commitment are
on display daily since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, will compete
against Moscow and perhaps Toronto and Paris as well as candidates
from Germany, Spain and elsewhere. The International Olympic
Committee will pick the 2012 site in 2005.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement sent New York 2012 supporters leaping out of
their chairs in glee. They hugged and shouted and exchanged
high-fives while Frank Sinatra's "New York, New York" belted out over
loudspeakers inside a convention hall at the Broadmoor Hotel. Asked
how satisfying it was to win, Dan Doctoroff, a New York deputy mayor
and the bid chief, replied, "On a scale of one to 10? 5,000!"</TE>
<TE>   Without overtly referring to the attacks, the New York
presentation had repeatedly shown delegates photos of the scarred
skyline. Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who drew a standing ovation
when he appeared on stage, said, "New Yorkers never give up. Never
have. Never will."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Michael Bloomberg asked the crowd rhetorically, "Which city
has the resources and the moxie to win in 2005?"</TE>
<TE>   Doctoroff said upon winning, "We are completely committed to this
notion of bringing the Games back to America, and we will do
everything in our power to achieve that."</TE>
<TE>   The USOC depends on a domestic Games to boost revenue and wants
the Games back here as soon as possible; 2012 is the first
possibility. The 2004 Summer Games will be in Athens, 2008 in
Beijing; the 2006 Winter Games will be staged in Turin, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the process is the selection for the 2010 Winter
Games. The IOC will pick that city next year. Vancouver, Canada, and
Salzburg, Austria, are the leading candidates. A Vancouver win for
2010 might make it problematic for the U.S. candidate in 2012; the
IOC prefers to spread the Games around continents.</TE>
<TE>   The vote Saturday followed presentations that emphasized the
differences between the San Francisco and New York bids -- even down
to the stars who shilled for each.</TE>
<TE>   Comedian Robin Williams, for instance, appeared in a video touting
San Francisco -- dressed up as a fake TV weatherman named "Del
Mundo," pointing to a map that showed San Francisco as "paradise" and
New York as "hot." He urged, "Vote for San Francisco! You will like
it! No mas caliente!"</TE>
<TE>   Comic Billy Crystal showed up for New York -- in person. The jokes
came fast and furious. He said about New York: "Eight million people,
five boroughs, two Clintons." In New York, "All the foreigners are
already there.... It's like a giant 7-Eleven." He asked, "Why even
have the Olympics in Beijing? We've got better Chinese food." And
finally: "Best of all, it's not New Jersey."</TE>
<TE>   On the serious side, San Francisco told the USOC delegates that
Northern California is beautiful, the weather great and many of its
venues already in place -- thus, San Francisco officials said,
resulting in capital costs of only $211 million and, at the end of
the Games, a $400-million surplus.</TE>
<TE>   A main thrust of the bid had been to earmark $140 million of that
surplus for the 28 national governing bodies that oversee the Summer
Olympic sports in the United States, $5 million to each -- seen by
some as a naked appeal to the USOC's financial interests.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately before Saturday's presentations began, however, voters
were told by Charles M. Moore, the USOC official who directed the bid
process, that, 10 years out, any surpluses were hypothetical and they
essentially ought to ignore any such claims. "They have no right to
go there," Moore said later.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to San Francisco, Jack Kelly, who was involved in
Houston's unsuccessful bid, said, "They were slammed, and then
[delegates] heard it five times."</TE>
<TE>   Another uncertainty in the San Francisco bid was the location of
the athletes' village. Bid documents say it would be built at Moffett
Field, but the former naval airbase might not be available. San
Francisco officials never said Saturday where the village would be
built.</TE>
<TE>   New York took the USOC delegates through a detailed showing of
each of its venues -- almost all of which are in the city itself --
and emphasized security, transport and other technical matters.</TE>
<TE>   It made sure voters knew that New York is the undisputed capital
of commerce and diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   The weather in New York in July and August is surprisingly OK,
with highs averaging 82 degrees, bid officials said. They said they'd
even researched this nugget -- during the 1990s, the Yankees and Mets
played 154 home games during the days the Games would run in New
York, from July 27 through Aug. 12. There were only four rainouts.</TE>
<TE>   To win internationally, however, a city must present a strong
story -- for the IOC has made it clear recently that it wants to show
the world with its selection of an Olympic city the relevance and
strength of what, in marketing terms, experts would call the "Olympic
brand."</TE>
<TE>   Athens won 2004 by connecting with the values of the ancient
Games. Beijing won 2008 because the IOC sees the opportunity to bring
the magic of the five rings to one of every five people on earth, the
population of China.</TE>
<TE>   Here the advantage New York had made clear during the months of
the domestic bid process became plain.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco's presentation returned again and again to weather
and pretty scenery. There was no overarching tale of inspiring values
or moral high notes. Kelly, the former Houston 2012 official, said
about the San Francisco story, in a wry reference to Gertrude Stein's
famous remark long associated with Oakland, "There was no there
there."</TE>
<TE>   New York's presentation emphasized in song and film the power of
those who live there, today's immigrants and those who came before,
to dream big -- and, as the Sinatra song says, to make it there.
Woody Allen, Robert DeNiro, Larry King, Michael J. Fox and others
took turns sharing the video screen with the likes of a city bus
driver.</TE>
<TE>   Again, without specifically mentioning the terrorist attacks, as
John Lennon's "Imagine" played, images of the city flickered across a
huge video screen, the Brooklyn Bridge, Chinatown, Times Square,
segueing into shots of fireworks blazing around the Statue of
Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   With the lights up, Giuliani said, "If you choose New York, if you
do us this honor, we want you to know in no uncertain terms: We will
not fail you."</TE>

<LD>Oregon had this one wrapped up by halftime.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Fife threw three touchdown passes and ran for another score
Saturday as the No. 19 Ducks bounced back from two consecutive
defeats with a 41-14 win over Stanford at Eugene, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a great effort in the first half, a workmanlike effort in
the second," Coach Mike Bellotti said. "It's much more fun to sit
here and talk about this after a win, making ourselves bowl eligible,
and ensuring a winning season."</LD>
<TE>   Oregon, coming off home losses to Arizona State and USC, beat
Stanford for only the second time in six tries at Autzen Stadium but
started slow.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't doing the little things again, and it kind of scared
me at first," Fife said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, 7-2 overall, 3-2 in the conference, won without
starting tailback Onterrio Smith, sidelined with a minor knee injury
that is not expected to keep him out next week against Washington
State.</TE>
<TE>   Terrence Whitehead rushed for 132 yards in 29 carries in place of
Smith, the conference's leading rusher.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of Jason Siegel's field goal with 1:20 left,
the Ducks did all their scoring in the first half -- building a 38-7
lead by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt freshman quarterback Kyle Matter completed nine of 19
passes for 71 yards for Stanford (2-6, 1-4). Matter started in place
of Chris Lewis, who had an injured shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal handed Oregon its only loss last season en route to
its second consecutive conference title and a No. 2 national ranking.</TE>

<TE>   Oregon State 38, Arizona 3 -- Steven Jackson rushed for 134 yards
and two touchdowns as the Beavers (6-3, 2-3) defeated the Wildcats
(3-6, 0-5) at Corvallis, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Anderson passed for 239 yards and a score for Oregon State,
which won its second in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona, which has lost five in a row and remained the only
winless team in the Pac-10, had minus-23 yards rushing and 93 yards
overall.</TE>

<HD>The New Bruins: Cardiac Kids With a Pulse in November</HD>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>There is heart in this UCLA football team and that is a big deal. It
shouldn't be. It is assumed that college sports teams are filled with
young athletes who have non-stop enthusiasm, optimism and energy, who
always look forward and always keep trying.</LD>
<LD>   This has not been the case with Bruin football teams. Not the most
recent ones coached by Bob Toledo. Not the last three, which have
gone 4-11 over the last five games of the season.</LD>
<LD>   It has been embarrassing, it has been discouraging, it has come to
be expected. UCLA will deflate like a hot-air balloon when the gas
goes off.</LD>
<TE>   "This team has heart," redshirt freshman linebacker Spencer Havner
said. Havner said this just after he finished a game with an
interception returned for a touchdown, the final touchdown, the
game-clinching touchdown in UCLA's 34-24 win over Washington
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have heart," said Marcus Reese, a senior linebacker who had an
interception too, after Havner had tipped a Cody Pickett pass.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said, before Havner spoke, that his seniors have taken it
upon themselves to educate the youngsters, the 10 true freshmen, the
12 redshirt freshmen who are getting serious playing time for the
Bruins. The seniors are teaching the rookies how a college football
team should behave when October turns to November.</TE>
<TE>   This might seem wrongheaded, having the same guys who have
collapsed three years running explain to the young and uninitiated
how not to fold up. But it's working.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins could have quit Saturday. Heck, they had been dead and
buried two weeks ago when they'd lost to Cal and had two quarterbacks
-- starter Cory Paus and backup Drew Olson -- injured. That game was
lost, and freshman quarterback Matt Moore lost his redshirt year by
playing in the following week's game, a victory over Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   There were even some UCLA fans who, having lost faith in Toledo,
were upset because now, they thought, Toledo might be given a pass on
a bad season. It would not be Toledo's fault, this collapse, because
he'd lost his quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Except the Bruins are not dead and buried.</TE>
<TE>   The way they beat the Huskies -- barely hanging on, looking
exhausted in the fourth quarter, seemingly having suffered one too
many injuries, having to put one too many rookies, scout-team guys,
last-gasp players on the field -- this win proved something.</TE>
<TE>   "We have heart," defensive end Dave Ball said.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned this team will not quit," senior cornerback Ricky
Manning said. Manning knows about the quitting. He's seen it happen
three years in a row. He will not talk about the past. He will say,
"This team is different. We know what's been said about us. But not
about this team. Don't talk about this team. This team has heart."</TE>
<TE>   There was a point in the fourth quarter, after Washington had
scored on a 66-yard pass from Pickett to receiver Paul Arnold, when
the Bruins could have quit. Arnold had faked Joe Hunter -- who had
come in for Matt Ware because Ware's hamstring was killing him --
right out of Husky Stadium, leaving him lying face-down on the field.
He lifted his head in time to see Arnold scoring untouched, a
touchdown that made the score 27-24 after the Bruins had once led,
27-14. This was when the Bruins could have caved in.</TE>
<TE>   Washington got the ball back twice with a chance to tie with a
field goal or win with a touchdown. Bruin players were cramping, even
in the cold. They were gasping for air, the ones still able to play.
The final stats would show Washington with 31 first downs to UCLA's
13; 498 total yards to UCLA's 316, 33 minutes 35 seconds of
possession to UCLA's 26:25.</TE>
<TE>   Twice in a row, though, the Bruin defense held. Once on third and
18 after Ball had sacked Pickett for an 11-yard loss, and again when
Havner intercepted Pickett's fourth-down pass and went 42 yards for
the clinching touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   These are plays of heart -- a big sack, a desperate interception,
one by a freshman, one by a defeat-hardened junior.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any huge superstars," Reese said. "Just a bunch of
normal guys. The new kids come in, they give the old guys a new
perspective. And now the chemistry's great."</TE>
<TE>   If this sounds as though the Bruins have taken a page from the
Angels' playbook, that's not a bad thing.</TE>
<TE>   "The senior leadership has been phenomenal," Toledo said. "Not one
person has quit on us. We lose to Oregon by a point. In the Cal game
we lose two quarterbacks and maybe should have won anyway. We're a
team that was very close to having a great season."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo knows what's been said about his teams, about how they
don't have the heart or stamina or will to finish strong. He will not
take exception. He will only say that things are different, that
there is "heart" and there is "chemistry."</TE>
<TE>   "We can't change people's minds by talking," Manning said.
"Opinions only change if we change."</TE>
<TE>   It will take more than this victory to change minds. The Bruins
will have to win at Arizona next weekend and acquit themselves well
in home games against USC and Washington State. The Bruins will have
to play three more times as if they were playing the most important
games ever. Because they are. These three games mean everything to a
program that needs its identity changed.</TE>

<HD>Florida Spoils Party Again for No. 5 Georgia, 20-13</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was no party for Georgia on this night. That privilege belonged
once again to Florida, the team that befuddles the Bulldogs like no
other.</LD>
<LD>   On a night when the fifth-ranked Bulldogs could have clinched a
title, Rex Grossman ruined those plans. The Florida quarterback
completed 36 of 46 passes for 339 yards Saturday to help the Gators
breathe life into their on-and-off season with a 20-13 victory at
Jacksonville, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   "This was huge," Grossman said. "It couldn't have been any bigger
for us."</LD>
<TE>   In a season on the verge of flaming out, the Gators (6-3, 4-2)
proved they didn't need Steve Spurrier to beat Georgia. Florida won
the game known as the World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party for the
12th time in 13 years, this time with Ron Zook as coach.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs (8-1, 5-1) could have clinched the SEC East -- their
first significant title since they won the conference in 1982 -- and
made headway in the national-title race on a day in which three other
undefeated teams lost.</TE>
<TE>   Leading receiver Taylor Jacobs left during the first series with
an injured right knee that could keep him out four weeks. But
trailing 13-12 early in the fourth quarter, Grossman led Florida on
an 89-yard touchdown drive he called the best his team has produced
this year. He capped it with a perfect 10-yard touchdown lob to Ben
Troupe.</TE>
<TE>   Troupe's pretty touchdown catch was a welcome reprieve from a
night filled with mistakes and missed opportunities. The Gators
missed a 27-yard field goal and an extra point, turned the ball over
four times and came up empty on three first-half trips inside
Georgia's 20.</TE>
<TE>   But Georgia matched Florida error for error. The Bulldogs
committed three turnovers. They netted nothing on two trips inside
Florida's 20 in the second half. They went 0 for 13 on third-down
conversions. D.J. Shockley had a pass that was intercepted by Guss
Scott and returned 47 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The capper came with 2:23 left, when receiver Terrence Edwards was
wide open at the Florida 30 but dropped a long pass from David Greene
that landed right in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   Three plays after the drop, on fourth and one from the Florida 42
with 1:50 left, Greene threw high to Tony Milton, who couldn't hang
on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 Alabama 30, Vanderbilt 8 -- Tyler Watts threw for 176 yards
and ran for a touchdown and the defense set the tone as Alabama won
at Nashville to post its 18th consecutive victory in the series. The
Crimson Tide (7-2, 4-1) held the Commodores (2-7, 0-5) to a
season-low 162 yards and forced two turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 25 Tennessee 18, South Carolina 10 -- Playing without injured
star Kelley Washington and in danger of losing three in a row for the
first time in 10 years, Casey Clausen threw for one touchdown and ran
for another -- scoring on a five-yard run on fourth and one in the
fourth quarter -- to help the Volunteers win at Columbia, S.C.
Tennessee (5-3, 2-3) has won 10 in a row over South Carolina (5-4,
3-3).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Auburn 31, Mississippi 24 -- Travaris Robinson's interception in
the end zone with 1:52 remaining helped seal the victory for Auburn
at Oxford, Miss. Ronnie Brown rushed for 224 yards and three
touchdowns in 33 carries for the Tigers (6-3, 4-2). The Rebels fell
to 5-4, 2-3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky 45, Mississippi State 24 -- Derek Abney returned two
punts for touchdowns to help the Wildcats win at Starkville, Miss.
Abney's first touchdown came on a 69-yard punt return to turn a close
game into a rout for Kentucky (6-3, 2-3). Mississippi State is 3-5,
0-4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas 23, Troy State 0 -- Cornerback Bo Mosley scored two
touchdowns, on a blocked punt and an interception, to help the
Razorbacks win at Little Rock, Ark. The Razorbacks are 5-3; Troy
State is 3-7.</TE>

<LD>Bouncing here and there around the Los Angeles area, while also
reminding ESPN there is life west of Denver....</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   I WAS on my way to Fontana and the California Speedway for the
qualifying run for today's Championship Auto Racing Teams Toyota 500
when I heard Tony Kanaan took the pole position at 232.01 mph -- only
42.01 mph faster than what my daughter had been clocked by the
California Highway Patrol on Interstate 15 recently. I've seen the
Grocery Store Bagger, so there's no need to hurry home.</LD>
<TE>   "I was only going 90 mph; not 190," the daughter said, and she
told the same thing to the CHP officer, and can't figure out why he
gave her a ticket.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WENT to the Clipper-Laker game Friday night at Staples Center to
see how Kobe Bryant would respond to an ESPN.com story calling Bryant
"uncoachable," and came away once again impressed with Bryant's
maturity.</TE>
<TE>   Charley Rosen, who wrote a book with Phil Jackson, apparently took
an informal and implied off-the-record conversation with assistant
coach Tex Winter and made a story out of it condemning Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson called it "irresponsible journalism," and because Rosen
didn't make an appearance at the news conference, I relayed Jackson's
comment to him.</TE>
<TE>   "[Winter] still said those things," Rosen said, and I said that
doesn't mean he's still not a journalist being irresponsible. Rosen
didn't disagree. That was too late to save Bryant from having to
defend himself, which he did with honesty, eloquence and then with
one of the best on-court performances of his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I ASKED Jackson if he'd be writing his next book with Rosen, and
he said he's doing it himself. I asked what he intended to call it,
and he said, "Four Play." He might have also said, "Fore Play," or
"Foreplay." I can't be sure because I didn't ask him how to spell it,
or who might be writing the forward in this new page turner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IN WHAT must be considered landmark TV for ESPN, the network has
decided to acknowledge the West Coast and include a sports columnist
from The Times when "Around the Horn" makes its debut Monday at 2
p.m. (ESPN rejected the idea of naming the sports rant, which
features four shouting columnists and a screaming young host, "The
SIMERS Show.")</TE>
<TE>   I predicted the show might be canceled after Day 1, but to prevent
this, ESPN has asked The Times columnist to stay off camera Tuesday
and Wednesday -- in what insiders are calling a move to maintain
quality control.</TE>
<TE>   This will also allow ESPN to resume regular East Coast bias
programming without a West Coast presence on the screen -- making
this show no different from most ESPN presentations.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN, based in Connecticut, already features the "Sports
Reporters," which is based in New York featuring East Coast reporters
talking about the Yankees; "Sports Reporters II," based in New York
and featuring East Coast broadcasters talking about the Yankees;
"Pardon the Interruption," based in Washington and featuring two
Washington Post writers talking about Michael Jordan; and now "Around
the Horn," based in Washington featuring host Max Kellerman, who has
never been farther west than Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   I hope to provide ESPN with a map so it can find its way to the
land of champions, which already includes the Angels, Lakers, Galaxy
and Sparks. I've got so much to say about the Sparks, but I'm being
held back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TROJANS unveiled a Heisman Trophy campaign featuring Carson
Palmer leading into a week in which he wasn't playing. That's
probably a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   USC's Heisman campaign says: "The critics are raving about the
Carson show," quoting Coach Pete Carroll: "He's got to be one of the
best quarterbacks in America." That was news to me: I had no idea
Carroll had been one of his critics.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA COACH Bob Toledo has a little Steve Lavin in him -- just when
you think you've got him down, it's time to sing his praises.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AS A public service, I'd like to say to anyone who wants to invite
sports enthusiast and comedian George Lopez to play in a pro-am golf
tournament -- don't. Watch "The George Lopez Show" on ABC Wednesdays
because it's hilarious. Catch one of his stand-up routines. Invite
him to the pro-am dinner. But do not find yourself standing in the
same zip code or nearby area codes when he's hitting a golf ball.</TE>
<TE>   We played at Oakmont Country Club in Glendale, and if someone's
car got hit on Verdugo Road around 11:14 a.m., "Be sure to bring your
receipt from Bob's World of Windshields if you want me to pay for
it," Lopez said. I guess he has done this before.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, who grew up a die-hard Dodger fan and who fashions himself
an athlete despite the bowler's physique, is going to appear Nov. 11
on "Best Damn Sports Show Period!" Which means it will be safe to
drive down Verdugo again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ACTRESS SANDRA Bullock gave Lopez his big TV shot, and producer
Frank Pace keeps the show running smoothly, while also playing golf
with Lopez when no one else will. Pace invited Steve Garvey, Rod
Carew, Jim Palmer and Joe Morgan to appear as bobblehead dolls on a
recent show. I was invited to the set to watch the proceedings, so
Bullock left town.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WENT to Santa Anita for the California Cup on Saturday to
interview jockey Julie Krone, riding now after retiring three years
ago, but was told I'd have to wait until she finished showering and
got ready. Even though it might be a couple of days, I'll let you
know when I get the chance to talk to her.</TE>

<HD>Cohen's Win Not Perfect</HD>

<DL>QUEBEC CITY</DL>
<LD>Happy though she was to earn her first Grand Prix figure skating
title, Sasha Cohen was realistic about her Skate Canada triumph.</LD>
<LD>   In a field that lacked Olympic champion Sarah Hughes, reigning
world champion Irina Slutskaya and four-time world champion Michelle
Kwan, Cohen easily outskated Fumie Suguri of Japan and Viktoria
Volchkova of Russia Saturday with a crowd-pleasing performance.</LD>
<LD>   However, she simplified two planned triple-triple combination
jumps to triple-doubles and fell on the first part of another
triple-triple, leaving her philosophical.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel like it's an OK place to start from," said Cohen, whose
family left Laguna Niguel in September so she could train in
Connecticut with Tatiana Tarasova. "It's definitely special to win,
but it's a little empty without all my strongest competitors here.
I'm happy that I won, but I wasn't quite as happy with my skate."</TE>
<TE>   None of the top three women skated exceptionally well, reflecting
the early stage of the figure skating season. The other U.S. entrant,
Jennifer Kirk, moved up from seventh to sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen was electrifying during her spiral sequence and a rapid
closing spin that dazzled the crowd of 6,555 at the Colisee Pepsi.
But her fall marred the overall effect, as did Volchkova's fall on a
triple flip. Suguri, whose third-place finish at the World
Championships was one spot ahead of Cohen, didn't fall Saturday but
wobbled on several landings and opened up on the first part of a
planned triple-triple.</TE>
<TE>   Under the interim judging system in use this season, Cohen's marks
from the 10 judges ranged from 5.3 to 5.7 (out of 6.0) for technical
merit and 5.7s and 5.8s for presentation. Suguri's technical marks
went from 5.1 to 5.5 and her presentation marks from 5.1 to 5.7.
Volchkova, fighting back pain from a collision with Kirk on Saturday
morning, got 4.7 to 5.4 for technical merit and 5.0 to 5.7 for
presentation.</TE>
<TE>   "For today, is enough for me," Tarasova said of Cohen's
performance. "It's after that we [will] show more, more, more. She is
competing for a high position in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cohen: "After an Olympic year there's a lot of letdown, and
everybody's getting ready for another season.... We'd better all get
in shape by worlds."</TE>
<TE>   Takeshi Honda of Japan, who trains in Canada, landed a quadruple
salchow and a quadruple toe loop in overtaking Canada's Emanuel
Sandhu for the men's title. Sandhu, notorious for collapsing in the
long program, held onto second, ahead of Stanislav Timchenko of
Russia. Derrick Delmore of the U.S. was fifth, with compatriot Ryan
Bradley sixth.</TE>

<HD>Williams Draw String Continues</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The familiar sight of Serena Williams and Venus Williams meeting in
another significant final could unfold at Staples Center in the
season-ending $3-million WTA Championships.</LD>
<LD>   It happened in three of the four Grand Slam tournaments in 2002,
so why not again?</LD>
<LD>   As usual this year, the sisters were seeded first and second and
placed on opposite sides of the draw, which was conducted Saturday in
Santa Monica. The tournament, which moved from Munich, Germany, to
Los Angeles, will open with first-round matches Wednesday and
conclude Nov. 11 with a Monday night final. It is a
single-elimination format.</LD>
<TE>   If form holds, top-seeded Serena, the defending champion, would
face No. 3 Jennifer Capriati in the semifinals, and No. 2 Venus would
meet No. 4 Justine Henin of Belgium. Serena beat Venus in three Grand
Slam finals this year -- the French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open.
Capriati won the first major of the season, the Australian Open in
January, and has not won a tournament since.</TE>
<TE>   The draw didn't grant any favors to close friends Monica Seles and
Lindsay Davenport, who will meet in the opening round. The
sixth-seeded Seles has not played a tournament since the week after
the U.S. Open because of injuries, and Davenport has been playing
regularly to qualify for this event, a car ride away from her home in
Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams has not played much more than Seles since the Open
and faces a tricky first-round opponent in Patty Schnyder of
Switzerland. Venus has been idle since Oct. 3, when she lost to
Magdalena Maleeva in Moscow. Schnyder, meanwhile, defeated Davenport
in three sets to win the title at Zurich last month.</TE>
<TE>   Belgians Henin and No. 5 Kim Clijsters could meet in the
quarterfinals, and the two seem to have a way of running into each
other, most notably when Clijsters beat Henin in the semifinals of
the 2001 French Open. Clijsters has defeated Henin twice in three
matches this year.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Smashnova of Israel, Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia and
Anastasia Myskina of Russia are first-time qualifiers for the event.</TE>

<HD>Nebraska Loses at Home Again to No. 7 Texas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LINCOLN, Neb.</DL>
<LD>No matter how poorly Nebraska has played on the road, it's nearly
invincible at home. That is, until the Texas Longhorns come to town.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Simms passed for a career-high 419 yards and Nathan Vasher
intercepted Jammal Lord's pass at the Texas one-yard line in the
closing seconds to give No. 7 Texas a 27-24 victory over Nebraska on
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Roy Williams caught 13 of Simms' passes for 161 yards as the
Longhorns (8-1, 4-1 in conference) handed the Cornhuskers (7-3, 3-2)
only their second home loss since Sept. 21, 1991.</LD>
<TE>   On Oct. 31, 1998, the Longhorns came into Lincoln and won, 20-16,
ending Nebraska's school-record streak of 47 consecutive victories at
Memorial Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Simms' performance overshadowed a career day for Lord, who ran for
234 yards and passed for 98, including a 60-yard touchdown pass to
tight end Matt Herian.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska's final possession came after DeJuan Groce's 44-yard punt
return gave the Cornhuskers the ball at the Texas 16 with less than a
minute left. Three plays later, Lord tried to hit split end Wilson
Thomas on the right side, but his pass was picked off by Vasher.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Takes Its Picks</HD>
<DH>Four interceptions make the difference in 34-24 victory
over Washington, including a 42-yard return for a touchdown with 1:17
to play. Olson overcomes nerves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>No one will remember the five UCLA false starts. Not when quarterback
Drew Olson's first start had such a pleasant ending.</LD>
<LD>   No one will remember Washington quarterback Cody Pickett for his
429 yards passing. Not when simply pronouncing his name will remind
the Bruins that they intercepted four of his passes.</LD>
<LD>   No one will remember the injury that sidelined UCLA cornerback
Matt Ware. Not when defensive end Dave Ball turned up the heat and
sacked Pickett three times.</LD>
<TE>   And no one will remember recent Bruin red zone woes. Not when
tailback Tyler Ebell made like one of the boats in adjacent Lake
Washington and brought the Bruins into the safe harbor of the end
zone three times.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA overcame 13 penalties, another nervous freshman quarterback
and a banged-up secondary to defeat Washington, 34-24, Saturday at
Husky Stadium in a Pacific 10 Conference game that might have created
a contender and revealed a pretender.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago UCLA had an identical record, 6-3, but the feeling in
Westwood was totally different.</TE>
<TE>   That team had just lost three in a row with 23 seniors and its
focus was irreparably fractured.</TE>
<TE>   This team has won two in a row and is 4-1 on the road and 3-2 in
the conference with 22 freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   As for focus, it's on next week's game against Arizona. No talk of
qualifying for a bowl game with a sixth victory. And certainly no
pie-in-the-sky discussion of the possibility of winning three more
and sneaking into the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned that lesson last year," cornerback Ricky Manning said.
"We're not talking about being bowl eligible."</TE>
<TE>   Manning had one of the interceptions that thwarted Washington
(4-5, 1-4), which is in danger of posting a nonwinning record for the
first time in 26 years. Marcus Reese, Jarrad Page and Spencer Havner
had the others, and each one silenced the crowd of 72,017 that
alternately thundered and grumbled.</TE>
<TE>   "[Pickett] was frustrated that there were a couple things that
happened during the game where he was wondering about the
communication," Washington Coach Rick Neuheisel said. "All I am
trying to do is get him to relax. When he is in that kind of rhythm,
he is outstanding. When things get going, as is the case with most
human beings, it's more difficult to function as effectively."</TE>
<TE>   Reese's interception was the first sign of trouble for Pickett,
and it set up a touchdown early in the second quarter that extended
UCLA's lead to 17-7. The pass was tipped by Havner and Reese returned
it 29 yards to the Washington one-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   The next interception was Manning's, which ended a long Husky
drive late in the second quarter that began at the UCLA two. A
pass-interference call gave Washington the ball at the UCLA 26 with
13 seconds left, but Manning caught the errant pass at the goal line
and the half ended with UCLA ahead, 24-14.</TE>
<TE>   Page, a freshman safety who played despite a bruised shin, sore
knee and sprained thumb, made his first career interception in the
first minute of the third quarter. He returned it 14 yards to
midfield and after Olson hit Mike Seidman for a 42-yard gain on third
down, Nate Fikse kicked his second field goal to stretch the lead to
27-14.</TE>
<TE>   Havner's interception nailed the coffin. Washington trailed by
only three with 1:17 to play when he speared Pickett's pass and
returned it 42 yards for a touchdown, his second score of the season.</TE>
<TE>   And Ball, who has 10 sacks this season, headed a strong rush that
forced Pickett to rush many of his passes.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody did a great job of making up for me being out," said
Ware, who left late in the second quarter because of a strained
hamstring, an injury that is not expected to be serious.</TE>
<TE>   His replacement, Joe Hunter, became the hunted much of the second
half. Pickett picked on him time and again, and he held his own until
Paul Arnold turned a five-yard catch into a 66-yard touchdown after
juking Hunter near the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Marcus Cassel replaced Hunter for a few plays, then gave
way to Keith Short, who nearly had an interception two plays before
Havner made his big play.</TE>
<TE>   "We started running out of players," UCLA Coach Bob Toledo said.
"Keith Short did a nice job. So did Cassel and [reserve safety] Kevin
Brandt."</TE>
<TE>   The most prominent player thrust into action was Olson, who last
week watched fellow freshman Matt Moore defeat Stanford in his first
start.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo informed Olson six hours before game time that he would
make his first start. Although he was nervous early, tripping and
falling while dropping back on a third-down play from the Husky
five-yard line, eventually his passes were as crisp as a Washington
apple.</TE>
<TE>   "He was anxious, antsy, then he started to smooth it out,"
receiver Tab Perry said. "When he called plays early in the game he
was rushing, but he picked up more confidence after he completed a
few passes."</TE>
<TE>   Olson had modest numbers, completing 13 of 27 passes for 189 yards
with no touchdowns. But like Moore a week earlier, he did not have a
pass intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   "This was such a loud stadium," Olson said. "Once I completed a
few, I relaxed and calmed down."</TE>
<TE>   Washington held a brief 7-3 lead after a blocked punt set up a
13-yard touchdown pass from Pickett to Reggie Williams. After Ebell,
who rushed for 102 yards, scored twice on one-yard runs, Pickett hit
Kevin Ware from 20 yards for Washington's only other points of the
half.</TE>
<TE>   Olson's early nervousness was masked by big plays from his
teammates. Ebell bolted 23 yards on his first carry, Craig Bragg
returned a punt 48 yards and Junior Taylor took a pitch from Olson on
a swinging gate trick play for 38 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of guys contributed, young and old," Ball said. "That's the
way it's gotten on this team. It's becoming a fun season."</TE>

<LD>Steve Henson's keys to the game, and how the Bruins measured up:</LD>
<LD>   1. Tailback Tyler Ebell must run well against a Husky defense that
is porous against the pass and stingy against the run: Ebell rushed
for 102 yards, his fifth consecutive game of more than 100, and had
three touchdowns on one-yard runs.</LD>
<LD>   2. The Bruin secondary must intercept passes to ease the burden on
the Bruin offense: UCLA made a season-high four interceptions, one
each by Ricky Manning, Jarrad Page, Marcus Reese and Spencer Havner.</LD>
<TE>   3. Nate Fikse must continue to kick well in his second week of
double duty: Fikse was two for two on field goals, giving him seven
of seven in two games since taking over for Chris Griffith.</TE>

<HD>Ebell Rushes to Top of Freshman List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Tyler Ebell's yardage total is climbing as fast as an Eminem CD.</LD>
<LD>   The tailback became UCLA's all-time freshman rusher on a 22-yard
run in the second quarter that keyed a drive that ended with his
third touchdown of the game.</LD>
<LD>   Ebell had 80 of his 102 yards by halftime against a Washington
defense that had been surrendering a Pacific 10 Conference-best 79
yards a game. It was his fifth consecutive 100-yard performance, a
feat surpassed only once at UCLA, by Gaston Green in 1986.</LD>
<TE>   Ebell has 734 yards this season, surpassing the 706 gained by Eric
Ball when he was a freshman in 1985. But the 5-foot-9, 170-pound back
was happiest about scoring three times on one-yard runs.</TE>
<TE>   "There were red-zone issues and short-yardage issues, and I'm glad
we responded to that," he said. "I feel I can be dependable in
short-yardage situations and I proved I could be."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ebell's punt returning duties might be over. At one time it was a
way for him to get his hands on the ball. Now it is an unnecessary
burden for a runner who has 153 carries in the last five games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big load off my shoulders," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Bragg, another big-play threat, returned three punts for 63
yards, including a 48-yarder.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't going to use Bragg as much in the offense," Coach Bob
Toledo said. "This was a way to get him more involved in the game."</TE>
<TE>   For the season, Bragg is averaging 15.7 yards on six returns;
Ebell is averaging 11.6 yards on 23 returns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Matt Ware said his strained left hamstring should not
sideline him for next week's game at Arizona. He left the game late
in the second quarter and did not return.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat on the bench during the second half with a towel on my
head," he said. "I felt like I was letting my teammates down. But
they really came through."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dave Ball extended his sack streak to seven games with a flourish,
notching three.</TE>
<TE>   The first came in the second quarter, the second came on the last
play of the third quarter, but neither was as important as the last
one.</TE>
<TE>   With UCLA clinging to a 27-24 lead, Washington marched to the
Bruin 31 when Ball brought down quarterback Cody Pickett for a
10-yard loss on second down. Brandon Chillar knocked down a pass on
third down and the Huskies had to punt with 3:12 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to put on pressure by shortening the edge," he said.
"I'm just feeling a little quicker every week."</TE>
<TE>   Ball, a junior defensive end, has 10 sacks this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A trick play -- the swinging gate -- that the Bruins worked on all
week in practice helped quarterback Drew Olson overcome his
nervousness and led to their first points.</TE>
<TE>   On third and 17 from the Washington 43 in the first quarter, Olson
walked up to the ball and pitched it to Junior Taylor, who was lined
up behind a wall of blockers near the left hashmark.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, a freshman receiver, galloped 38 yards. UCLA had to settle
for a field goal after Olson tripped and fell while dropping back on
third down.</TE>
<TE>   The play was called again in the third quarter, but a five-yard
gain by Taylor was nullified because Bruin linemen were not set.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chris Singleton started at tailback for Washington only because
Rich Alexis was injured. Now the job might be his for good.</TE>
<TE>   The Husky running game, ranked last in the Pac-10, got a boost
from the sophomore, who rushed for 92 yards in 20 carries. Singleton
started the game with only 124 yards.</TE>

<HD>Washington State, Gesser Are Second to None</HD>
<DH>Quarterback sets two records, gives Cougars sole possession
of Pac-10 lead with 44-22 win over Arizona State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PULLMAN, Wash.</DL>
<LD>The Washington State Cougars found someone to pummel other than
themselves. Not surprisingly, they scored a knockout.</LD>
<LD>   Demonstrating the concept of applied learning, eighth-ranked
Washington State came out swinging Saturday and dropped No. 16
Arizona State, 44-22, before 37,444 fans in chilly weather at Martin
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   For a team that could have been fractured by a locker room fight
Tuesday, the Cougars did almost nothing wrong, owning a 37-8 lead
entering the fourth quarter and taking clear control of the Pacific
10 Conference race.</LD>
<TE>   The postgame celebration on the field was an obvious turnaround
from a few days earlier, when linebacker Ira Davis sucker-punched
cornerback Jason David because of an apparent spat over a female
student, whom Washington State Coach Mike Price cryptically referred
to all week as "a third party."</TE>
<TE>   It was a literal black eye for a program that had become a
national darling of sorts, basking in a reputation as those gutsy
little guys from the Pacific Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was suspended indefinitely and David, the Pac-10 leader in
interceptions and former Covina Charter Oak High standout, will be
out for a month because of a broken cheekbone, leaving the Cougars
with only two scholarship defensive backs and what was believed to be
a divided team.</TE>
<TE>   Throw in the fact that 19 players suffered from flu-like symptoms
during the week, and it appeared the Washington State defense would
never rest against Arizona State quarterback Andrew Walter, who
shredded Oregon two weeks ago for a Pac-10 record 536 passing yards.</TE>
<TE>   But the Cougars had eight sacks, Jason Gesser set two school
passing records and Price heaved a sigh of relief at his postgame
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "With everything that went on this week, it seemed like it had
been a month since our last game," Price said. "When things like this
happen, they can bleed and go on and on and on. We hit it head on,
told [our players] what happened and said we need to do this as a
team."</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars also did Pac-10 number-crunchers a favor, eliminating
-- for now -- the need for Rose Bowl tiebreaker formulas. .</TE>
<TE>   Washington State (8-1, 5-0 in the Pac-10) has a decisive edge over
Arizona State (7-3, 4-1) and USC (6-2, 4-1) because it has beaten
both of them.</TE>
<TE>   The depleted Cougar defense also had an edge for most of
Saturday's game. Arizona State's offense crumbled whenever it came
close to the goal line. Walter was sacked six times and failed to get
the Sun Devils into the end zone until 13:51 remained.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State had four turnovers and was held to a field goal on
three drives that penetrated the Cougars' five-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the whole game right there," Arizona State Coach Dirk
Koetter said. "Take every story and throw it out the window because
if you get the ball inside the five three times and score three
points, you're not going to win."</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils had problems on defense too. Terrell Suggs ripped
through Washington's offensive linemen last week as if they were
turnstiles, getting 4 1/2 sacks. Suggs was held to one sack and four
tackles Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it was because of the cold or something," Washington State
offensive lineman Calvin Armstrong said. "He seemed a half-step slow.
He was a little off his game today."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Gesser continued to be the man responsible for pulling
the Cougars out of their late-'90s funk.</TE>
<TE>   The antithesis of 6-foot-5 statues Ryan Leaf and Drew Bledsoe,
Gesser scrambled, shimmied and screen-passed his way to the
Washington State career passing record, breaking Jack Thompson's
yardage mark with a five-yard toss to Jerome Riley with 11:33 left.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-1 Gesser has 7,841 yards passing after completing 18 of
32 passes for 250 yards and three touchdowns. He also broke Leaf's
school record for career touchdown passes (59) when he connected with
Riley for a 31-yard score 1:15 into the game.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser is also 18-3 in his last 21 games and has provided a
refreshing blast of polar air to a program that had gone 10-24 in the
three seasons after losing to Michigan in the 1998 Rose Bowl. In the
last two seasons, only Miami and Oklahoma have better records than
Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the season, I'll look back and say, 'Boy this was
phenomenal,' " said Gesser, a fifth-year senior.</TE>
<TE>   "At that time, hopefully I'll have a smile on my face and say, 'We
won the Pac-10 championship, we won the Rose Bowl and we had a good
time along the way.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Broken Record</TE>
<TE>   After becoming Washington State's total offense leader last week,
quarterback Jason Gesser added two more records to his list of
accomplishments Saturday as he passed Jack Thompson as the school's
all-time leader in passing yards and Ryan Leaf in touchdown passes. A

<LD>Chris Vance helped Ohio State defeat Minnesota, 34-3, Saturday at
Columbus, Ohio, despite playing with a heavy heart.</LD>
<LD>   Vance learned before the game that his 21-year-old younger
brother, Percy Burton, was shot to death Friday night in Fort Myers,
Fla. The senior wide receiver had Burton's name, birth date, date of
death and "R.I.P." written on his uniform.</LD>
<LD>   "It was my decision to play," Vance said. "And it was my escape."</LD>
<TE>   Vance, whose father died of AIDS in prison before last year's
Minnesota game, caught only one pass, but it went for a 30-yard
touchdown with 1:15 left in the third quarter that gave the Buckeyes
a 27-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted him to make a big catch," quarterback Craig Krenzel
said. "For him to do that is something special."</TE>
<TE>   Vance dedicated the touchdown to his brother, saying, "I know he
would have wanted me to play."</TE>

<HD>Civility in Political Campaigns Turns Out to Be a Fad</HD>
<DH>A change in tone after the 9/11 attacks has gone by the
wayside, affecting this fall's races and threatening to suppress
Tuesday's turnout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>So much for the 9/11 effect on politics.</LD>
<LD>   Despite hints that the political dialogue after last year's
terrorist attacks would take a more civil tone, the 2002
congressional campaign is winding up with a barrage of mudslinging,
name-calling and downright nasty advertising.</LD>
<LD>   It reverses a trend, documented in a study by the University of
Wisconsin Advertising Project, which found that for several months
after the terrorist attacks, political ads were considerably more
positive in tone than in the past.</LD>
<TE>   But in the last six weeks, the study found, mudslinging has
returned with a vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's back to negativity as usual," said Kenneth M. Goldstein, a
professor who conducted the study.</TE>
<TE>   In some races, the negative ads -- or backlash against them -- is
having real effect on the course of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In Montana, a Republican Senate candidate stopped campaigning
because of an ad that he said suggested he was homosexual. In New
York, a House Republican's race for reelection went from a slam-dunk
to a toss-up because of backlash against an attack ad he ran. In
Colorado, a tight Senate race has been marked by a steady diet of
negative campaigning, which analysts say is why a big chunk of the
electorate remains uncommitted to either candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The negative tone also may explain why experts predict middling
turnout in virtually every state on Tuesday, even though several
contests will determine control of the House and Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Advertising in the race for California governor has been
unremittingly negative, due largely to the campaign waged by
incumbent Democrat Gray Davis, starting in last winter's Republican
primary. In an extraordinary move, Davis intervened in the GOP
contest by sponsoring roughly $10 million in negative ads that
targeted the Republican front-runner, former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan. That helped long-shot businessman Bill Simon Jr.
defeat Riordan -- and gave Davis his preferred opponent for the fall
matchup.</TE>
<TE>   After just a few months' pause, Davis resumed the attack strategy,
this time savaging Simon's business record and integrity in a barrage
of spots that has scarcely let up since early June. Simon, with less
money to spend, has also taken a largely negative tack in his ads,
assailing Davis' record.</TE>
<TE>   But elsewhere in the country, the tone was different earlier in
the election cycle. Goldstein's study of congressional campaign ads
found that in the months before this year's anniversary of the Sept.
11 attacks, 82% of the ads paid for by House and Senate candidates
and 53% of those financed by political parties were positive -- up
from 73% and 14% respectively during the comparable period in the
2000 election cycle.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 anniversary, the percentage of positive ads
dropped to 65% for those paid for by candidates and 27% for those
financed by the parties. In one week in October, only 43% of all
kinds of ads were positive.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic media consultant, said that the
national trauma of last year's terrorist attacks had a lasting effect
on the ads she produced for politicians this year. For the first
time, she said, she made a point of including American flags in them:
"I made a conscious decision to avoid imagery disturbing to people."</TE>
<TE>   But with election day approaching, and the stakes so high, it's
not surprising that the gloves came off in many races.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein said that ads critiquing an opponent's personality and
positions on issues are not necessarily bad. Negative ads, he said,
often provide more information to voters than positive ones promoting
a given candidate's virtues.</TE>
<TE>   But experts agree candidates get into trouble when their attack
ads are based on false information or seem to voters to go too far.</TE>
<TE>   That may have happened in New York. GOP Rep. Felix J. Grucci Jr.
thrust his reelection contest into a maelstrom of controversy with a
radio ad that accused his opponent, Tim Bishop, of turning his back
on rape victims while president of Southampton College and of
falsifying the school's rape statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop said the ad was inaccurate, and a newspaper editorialized
that the ad brought "nasty new meaning to the word 'scurrilous.' "</TE>
<TE>   Grucci's campaign stood by the ad's accuracy, but it is no longer
running. Meanwhile, Grucci's race has abruptly turned from an easy
ride for him to one of the closest House contests.</TE>
<TE>   One of the campaign's most controversial ads was run in Georgia by
GOP Senate challenger Saxby Chambliss. It featured images of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, and questioned
Democratic Sen. Max Cleland's "courage to lead" because he has
opposed aspects of President Bush's proposal for a homeland security
department.</TE>
<TE>   Cleland, a Vietnam veteran who lost three limbs in combat, called
the ad "character assassination." Faced with a barrage of criticism,
Chambliss' campaign changed the ad to drop the images of Bin Laden
and Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   In House races, Republicans have targeted several Democratic
candidates with hard-hitting ads attacking their business and
financial practices.</TE>
<TE>   In a newly drawn district in Nevada, the GOP has highlighted the
ethics problems of Democratic candidate Dario Herrera, a county
commissioner who has been accused of improperly landing a no-bid
contract to do work for the Las Vegas Housing Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "Character is an important issue in elections," said Steve
Schmidt, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic strategists concede that the attack ads have
contributed to dimming their hopes of winning a seat once considered
promising for them.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats have done their share of attack ads -- most notoriously
in Montana, where polls have shown Sen. Max Baucus running way ahead
of his GOP opponent, Mike Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ran an ad
criticizing Taylor's past management of a beauty school. More
controversial than the words were the pictures shown of Taylor as a
beautician giving a facial to a man. Taylor claimed it implied
falsely that he was homosexual, and in early October quit the
contest. His name remains on the ballot, and he recently said he
would resume the race "to save our democracy from the smear
campaigns."</TE>
<TE>   Candidates from both parties have been hurling insults in the
Colorado Senate race, which the University of Wisconsin study found
had the second-highest percentage of negative ads in the country.
Ranked first was the New Jersey Senate race, where Republicans
appeared headed for victory by spotlighting ethical questions
surrounding Democratic incumbent Robert Torricelli. He has since
dropped out of the race and his replacement, former Sen. Frank R.
Lautenberg, is now favored to win.</TE>
<TE>   In Colorado, GOP Sen. Wayne Allard and his Democratic opponent,
Tom Strickland, have been attacking each other for months. Last
spring, Strickland ran an ad blasting Allard for opposing federal
accounting rules that he said might have averted the collapse of
Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Allard fired back with an ad noting that Strickland, a former U.S.
attorney who is now a lawyer, had lobbied for another spectacular
business failure, Global Crossing Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd Ciruli, a nonpartisan pollster in Denver, said the effect of
the mudfest has been to make it harder for either candidate to win
crucial swing voters.</TE>
<TE>   "They are in so much mud, [the candidates] can't get any
traction," Ciruli said.</TE>

<LD>   "I certainly sympathize with them, I understand their agony.
Whatever makes life easiest for them," Ryan said after addressing the
National Assn. of Criminal Defense Lawyers. "They've been through a
lot of pain...."</LD>
<LD>   Nine days of unprecedented clemency hearings for almost all the
inmates on Illinois' death row ended Monday. The hearings came more
than two years after Ryan halted all executions, citing the wrongful

<HD>Senate Foes in Missouri Offer Stark Contrast</HD>
<DH>Personalities may be as important as issues in the intense
race between incumbent Democrat Carnahan and GOP challenger Talent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DES PERES, Mo.</DL>
<LD>The candidates in one of the nation's tightest Senate races are
talking about all the big issues: Social Security, the dragging
economy, missile defense, taxes.</LD>
<LD>   But at least here in this key battleground of suburban St. Louis,
voters are focused more on personality than on positions.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Gregory, 29, says he'll vote for incumbent Democrat Jean
Carnahan "because she seems like a down-to-earth kind of person," not
a polished politician.</LD>
<TE>   "She's like the lady next door," puts in his friend, 28-year-old
Kay Reid.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Spillane, 67, backs the challenger, former Rep. Jim Talent
-- not on issues, but on the principle that the Republican candidate
is "more apt to support the president, and the president needs
support" in these uncertain times.</TE>
<TE>   A mid-October survey of likely voters found Talent leading, 47% to
41%. A month earlier, the same polling company, Zogby International,
found Carnahan ahead by 8 points. Given the margins of error in both
surveys -- and the difficulty determining which voters will actually
trek to the polls Tuesday -- most pundits call the race
excruciatingly close.</TE>
<TE>   That's no surprise; Missouri is a classic swing state. Republicans
and Democrats traditionally run neck and neck in statewide races.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a microcosm of the country as a whole," said David
Robertson, a political scientist at the University of Missouri.
"We're a reflection of the divisions we see in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Those divisions, however, are playing out with a twist in this
grinding, expensive, sometimes angry Senate race.</TE>
<TE>   Though she is the incumbent, Carnahan is a novice politician. In
fact, this is her first campaign. Her husband, Gov. Mel Carnahan, had
been running for the Senate when he was killed in a plane crash less
than three weeks before the 2000 election.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, it was too late for the Democrats to select a
replacement, so the governor's name remained on the ballot -- and
voters elected him posthumously, knowing that his wife had agreed to
serve in his place.</TE>
<TE>   The 68-year-old widow continues to draw voter sympathy for the
tragedy that put her in the Senate. (She lost not only her husband,
but also their oldest son, who was piloting the plane.) The recent
death of Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone in a campaign plane crash
revived memories of Carnahan's loss; some analysts suggest that can
only help the Missouri senator.</TE>
<TE>   But Carnahan's history cuts both ways.</TE>
<TE>   She has been termed the "accidental senator," portrayed as a sweet
grandmother who stumbled into office unprepared. Veteran Capitol Hill
analyst Charlie Cook, who publishes a nonpartisan newsletter, wrote
this year that Carnahan at times seemed "lost" in the Senate -- a
criticism he said he heard first from her fellow Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri Republicans have picked up the theme, with a commercial
suggesting that Carnahan doesn't understand the legislative process.</TE>
<TE>   Carnahan rejects such comments as political hatchet jobs; she
proudly puts her record up against any second-year senator's. Some
outside analysts, too, bristle at what they see as a demeaning
stereotype of a woman who is, by all accounts, bright, articulate and
politically savvy from three decades of promoting her husband's
career.</TE>
<TE>   "When men run for the Senate or for governor without any political
experience, hardly a word is spoken because they're men, so they're
somehow equipped to govern. But all of a sudden, Jean Carnahan comes
in and she's 'the grandma.' Well, how many grandfathers are there in
the Senate?" said Karen O'Connor, director of the Women &amp; Politics
Institute at American University in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The perception of Carnahan as ill-prepared for national politics
might also stem from her vote against John Ashcroft's appointment as
U.S. attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few months earlier, Ashcroft -- who was then Missouri's
junior senator -- had conceded after losing his seat to Carnahan's
late husband, declining to contest the unusual election. Ashcroft's
concession was universally praised as magnanimous. So when Carnahan
voted against his appointment, many Missourians were furious.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have much of an opinion of her," said Doris Werkema, 80,
who plans to back Talent. "I didn't think she was very gracious about
Ashcroft."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Talent does not talk much about how his opponent
gained her office. Instead, he emphasizes his own experience as a
legislator -- eight years in the Missouri House and another eight in
the U.S. House.</TE>
<TE>   Talent, 46, built that career on conservative principles -- above
all, cutting taxes and shrinking government. He wants to expand
President Bush's tax cuts: "I don't think you can balance the budget
without cutting taxes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Talent has opposed a ban on assault weapons and a hike in the
minimum wage. He helped write the five-year time limit for welfare
recipients -- and unsuccessfully sought to ban cash grants for women
who had children out of wedlock.</TE>
<TE>   Talent also backed early efforts to let younger workers invest
some of their Social Security contributions in the stock market. He
now insists, however, that he does not support privatizing Social
Security.</TE>
<TE>   Carnahan's positions are, in most cases, the reverse. She opposes
drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, calls for a
substantial increase in the minimum wage and wants the government to
offer seniors a prescription-drug benefit through Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   Such stances have prompted Talent to portray his opponent as a
pawn of Senate liberals. Carnahan, however, sells herself to Missouri
as a centrist.</TE>
<TE>   To win over hunters worried about her views on gun control, she
staged a skeet-shooting campaign stop over the summer, hitting nine
of 15 clay pigeons.</TE>
<TE>   She frequently reminds voters that she has sided with President
Bush on more than 70% of Senate votes, including his tax cut and
authorization of military action in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Yet she just as frequently tells the Democratic faithful that
she's the "No. 1 target of the White House."</TE>
<TE>   Bush has stumped for Talent at least three times -- and is
planning to return Monday. He has sent several special guests to
Missouri as well, including his wife, his father, members of his
Cabinet and key staffers.</TE>
<TE>   Carnahan has brought in her own luminaries, including fellow
senators and singer Sheryl Crow. Through mid-October, she had raised
more than $10 million, a Missouri record. Talent had raised nearly $7
million.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates have benefited from intense -- and sometimes nasty
-- advertising purchased by the national parties and by
special-interest groups concerned with everything from abortion to
taxes to defense.</TE>
<TE>   But the furious volleys have not made much impression on Darren
Dickerson, 38.</TE>
<TE>   Relaxing in a posh mall here in this wealthy suburb, he confessed
to tuning it all out. He does plan to vote. But for whom? "I couldn't
tell you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Informed that pundits are proclaiming Missouri's race pivotal --
and predicting that it will be every-vote-counts close -- Dickerson
vowed to study up before election day.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd better get busy," he said.</TE>

<LD>Walter F. Mondale and Norm Coleman will make time during their
six-day sprint to replace the late Sen. Paul Wellstone for a debate
on the eve of the election, their campaigns announced Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, both sides turned their attention Saturday for the
first time to trustworthiness and national security -- the topics
that had divided the race before Wellstone was killed in a plane
crash Oct. 25.</LD>
<LD>   Mondale, the Democrat and former vice president who jumped into
the campaign after Wellstone's death, asked voters to think about who
they would trust more in the Senate. Wellstone, in speeches and
advertising, repeatedly suggested Coleman couldn't be trusted.</LD>
<TE>   "Who do you trust? That's a big thing in politics because words
don't mean anything unless there is trust," Mondale said to voters in
Virginia, one of several towns he visited in northern Minnesota, a
traditionally Democratic region dominated by mining and forestry.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, a former St. Paul mayor, toured southern Minnesota, a
farm-rich area that tends to vote Republican. He also gingerly
returned to some of the issues that separated him and Wellstone.</TE>
<TE>   "I will work with our president to make sure our nation is
secure," Coleman said, without specifically mentioning Wellstone's
vote against a resolution authorizing President Bush to use military
force in Iraq. The House and Senate overwhelmingly passed the
resolution; Mondale earlier this week said he would have voted
against it.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates will get their first and only chance to hit on
those and other issues when they meet head to head in Monday
morning's debate at the Fitzgerald Theater.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important for voters to hear the vice president at
this point," Coleman said.</TE>

<DL>SILVER SPRING, Md.</DL>
<LD>Laurence M. Foley, the U.S. aid worker killed in a possible terrorist
attack in Jordan, was remembered Saturday as a big, boisterous man
whose humor and mischievous charm won him and his country countless
friends.</LD>
<LD>   About 250 people attended a memorial service at a Unitarian
Universalist church outside Washington that was marked by more
laughter than tears and more talk of his zest for life than his
violent death.</LD>
<LD>   "First, he hit you with his humor," said his son, Michael. "Then,
when you weren't looking, he'd smack you with his integrity."</LD>
<TE>   Foley, 60, was shot at close range Monday in front of his home in
Amman. The gunman escaped. No arrests have been made, but Islamic
extremists are suspected.</TE>
<TE>   Foley previously had postings in the Philippines, Bolivia, Peru
and Zimbabwe for the U.S. Agency for International Development and,
previously, the Peace Corps.</TE>
<TE>   Family and friends took turns describing how Foley loved his
travels and his work. He took delight in the people he met, "that
humanity came in so many shapes and sizes," said his daughter Megan.</TE>
<TE>   Many recalled how he reveled in the quirky moments in the life of
an aid worker: spending a night in a chicken coop to find out why
hens were mysteriously dying, eating at a Philippine restaurant built
out of an airplane once used by Elvis Presley or having an elegant
Indian man point to his freckles and ask, "Is that your desire, or is
that a disease?"</TE>
<TE>   Maja Cubarrubia, a Filipina colleague of Foley in the Peace Corps,
described her constant banter with him: He would tease her about her
height, she would tell him to lose weight.</TE>
<TE>   But she said she learned from Foley. He broke down the stereotypes
she had about Americans as rich, divorced and arrogant. And she
learned about herself.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry taught me through how he lived his life not to just be
tolerant of other people -- tolerant is not enough. He taught me to
accept and celebrate diversity and learn from it," she said.</TE>

<HD>Trial Proves Costly for Judge in Microsoft Case</HD>
<DH>She adhered to ethics rules and sold slumping technology
stocks for prices much lower than she had paid for them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Microsoft antitrust trial proved an expensive experience for the
trial judge. She sold her family's technology stocks during a
faltering economic period last year to abide by ethics rules,
according to the judge's latest financial records.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, whose overall holdings
still approach $1 million, took extraordinary losses last year in
some of those trades, which occurred during a serious slump in the
technology sector.</LD>
<LD>   The judge purchased up to $15,000 worth of stock in Sun
Microsystems Inc., one of Microsoft's fiercest rivals, in January
when its price closed at $30.88, records show. Sun developed the Java
programming technology that a U.S. appeals court determined was the
victim of an illegal Microsoft campaign to undermine its popularity.</LD>
<TE>   But weeks after her appointment in a courthouse lottery as the new
Microsoft trial judge in August last year -- and facing ethics rules
against such ownership -- she unloaded Sun when the price had plunged
to $10.95.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the judge purchased up to $15,000 in shares of Compaq
Computer Corp. in January, when the price was $15.78. But when she
sold her shares, also weeks after her new appointment, Compaq's price
had fallen to $8.52.</TE>
<TE>   Compaq, now owned by Hewlett Packard Co., has been a close ally of
Microsoft's and gains new freedom in how it can sell computers loaded
with the company's Windows software.</TE>
<TE>   The judge had previously said she sold technology holdings worth
$45,000 to $65,000 between Jan. 1 and Sept. 28 of last year to avoid
potential ethics conflicts. Details of those trades were unavailable
until she filed these latest disclosure documents with the
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.</TE>
<TE>   Executives or employees from Sun and Compaq testified before the
original trial judge in the case, Thomas Penfield Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly, who was named to replace Jackson, did not report
owning any Microsoft stock.</TE>
<TE>   Both U.S. law and federal ethics rules prohibit judges from ruling
in cases in which they have a financial interest that could be
substantially affected.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHUA, N.H.</DL>
<LD>Laura Bush, a librarian by profession, is spending a rare weekend as
a campaigner, politicking for Republicans in a four-state swing from
New Hampshire to South Dakota.</LD>
<LD>   The venture by the first lady, who normally avoids campaigning, is
a sign of how seriously her husband's administration is taking
Tuesday's midterm elections.</LD>
<LD>   "Everywhere I go people ask me what they can do to help the
president, and there is something you can do: You can elect these
great candidates here today to work with President Bush," Mrs. Bush
said Saturday at a rally for Rep. John Sununu, running for New
Hampshire's open Senate seat against a popular Democrat, Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen.</LD>
<TE>   The president, at a rally in Savannah, Ga., said he found it
"pretty ironic that she's the lead campaigner for my family. After
all, when I met her, she was a public school librarian. That in
itself doesn't say much except the truth is, she didn't like
politics, and she certainly didn't like politicians."</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Bush set out on a heavy day of get-out-the-vote appearances
in New Hampshire, Iowa and Minnesota. She was staying overnight in
South Dakota, then was to join the president for more campaigning
there today. Bush is particularly avid about the race in South
Dakota, where Rep. John R. Thune, the state's only congressman,
answered Bush's personal request to run against Democratic Sen. Tim
Johnson.</TE>

<HD>Surprise Contender in Oregon: Health Care for All</HD>
<DH>Full-coverage measure faced long odds because of tax
increase but also taps deep frustration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Y. Hong</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>On a crisp fall morning, Dan Isaacson and Britt McEachern walk door
to door in a neighborhood of tidy bungalows, eagerly selling their
health insurance plan.</LD>
<LD>   They promise a health care paradise: no deductibles or
co-payments, free prescription drugs, choice of any doctor, free
mental health care, dental, vision and long-term care.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not an HMO," they tell anyone who will listen. "The only
one who will say you can or can't have a procedure is your doctor."</LD>
<TE>   The catch? Oregonians would pay for that care through new income
and payroll taxes. And the state would manage all medical coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Isaacson, 22, and McEachern, 23, are managing a ballot initiative
campaign to make Oregon the first state to guarantee medical coverage
for everyone. Oregonians -- who already are voting by mail -- will
decide by Tuesday whether to adopt Measure 23.</TE>
<TE>   Because it calls for new taxes, Measure 23 faces long odds. But
with roughly 13% of Oregon residents without health insurance (close
to the national uninsured rate of 14.6%), frustration over health
care runs deep in the state.</TE>
<TE>   A recent newspaper poll found the health plan trailing by just 3
percentage points, within the poll's margin of error. The plan's
sponsors, a grass-roots group calling itself Health Care for All
Oregon, achieved that statistical dead heat despite being outspent 20
to 1 by the opposition, which is funded mostly by insurance
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Health Care for All Oregon was created by a handful of volunteers,
including retirees, physicians and community activists. With a
campaign headquartered in Isaacson's 10-year-old Dodge Spirit and
3,000 volunteers, the plan's backers have stunned their opponents,
who thought the measure would never get enough signatures to make it
onto the ballot. If the measure passes, Oregon will accomplish what
the Clinton administration failed to achieve nationally when its
health-care reform plan -- spearheaded by Hillary Rodham Clinton --
was shot down in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Under Measure 23, private medical insurance in Oregon would
disappear. The state would pay medical bills, which are expected to
total about $20 billion in 2005, when the program would begin.
Oregon's state budget is $16 billion.</TE>
<TE>   To finance the program, individuals would pay up to an additional
8% in income taxes, capped at $25,000. People with income at or below
150% of federal poverty guidelines would be exempt. Employers would
face a new payroll tax from 3% to 11.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of Measure 23 contend that the new taxes would be largely
offset by eliminating insurance premiums, deductibles, co-payments
and out of pocket drug costs.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the mere specter of tax increases will be enough to
defeat the measure. Even liberals routinely vote against tax
increases in a state without a sales tax, said Mark Nelson, the
lobbyist chairing Oregonians Against Unhealthy Taxes, the campaign
against the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said eliminating private insurance would be too radical for
most voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone believes we should continue to find ways to further
cover the uninsured, but their method is to toss out the entire
system," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Measure 23's opponents also have warned that sick people from
other states would move to Oregon and wealthy individuals or
businesses would move away to escape higher taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Isaacson and McEachern, hired to drum up support for the health
plan, contend that Measure 23 would cut health-care costs through
preventive care and lower administrative expenses. They say private
insurance companies waste money on high salaries and extravagant
offices. The charge that out-of-staters would flood Oregon is pure
speculation, they say.</TE>
<TE>   They nevertheless face constant reminders of the public's
suspicion. During an appearance on a conservative talk radio show,
"one person said we are Satan and Measure 23 is the apple," McEachern
said. But even those critics, he said, will give the devil his due.
"They'll say that, but they won't say the current system is working."</TE>
<TE>   If anything is more frightening to the public than a new
government bureaucracy, it might well be the health-care industry.
Measure 23 is offered at a time when health insurance and drug
companies are routinely cast as villains in movies, television shows
and books.</TE>
<TE>   "People may not like us, but they hate the insurance industry,"
Isaacson said.</TE>
<TE>   McEachern likened the behavior of insurance companies to free
advertising for Measure 23.</TE>
<TE>   "The insurance companies end up becoming our biggest supporters.
Every time they cut benefits and raise premiums, it helps us."</TE>
<TE>   By election day, insurers and other health industry donors will
have spent about $1.3 million to defeat the health plan, Nelson said,
adding that his group was late to begin fund-raising because its
backers thought the measure would not get enough signatures to
qualify for the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Isaacson and McEachern have less than $50,000 -- raised mostly
from individuals -- to run their campaign. They say they've been paid
about $1,000 each for their work over the last three months.</TE>
<TE>   Dissatisfaction with the status quo is obvious in Isaacson and
McEachern's visits to homes, even in the affluent, somewhat
conservative Eugene neighborhood they visited recently. Some told the
pair they were unwilling to pay more taxes, but many others, such as
Paul Armstrong, 60, spent more time talking than listening.</TE>
<TE>   "I had 58 stitches on this hand and I paid for it myself," said
Armstrong, holding up a hand with faint scars running across his
fingers, the vestiges of an accident with a table saw. A retired
builder, Armstrong said he spent so much on medical coverage for his
24 employees that he could not afford insurance for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong, a Republican, said he will take a chance by voting for
Measure 23 because the risk of higher taxes and more bureaucracy
seems less worrisome than the current system.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be topsy-turvy getting it organized, but somebody has to
start it. A lot of people now have no means whatsoever and really
need help," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To turn the disgust with the system into votes for the initiative,
the campaign is relying on personal contacts by volunteers. Their
plan is to speak in person or by phone to 300,000 voters.</TE>
<TE>   Although confident the measure will fail, Nelson acknowledges that
it "sounds very enticing" to many voters. Senior citizens whose
health-care costs are high, but whose incomes are low enough to be
exempt from the new taxes, for instance, are potential supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "When you put different populations together, you'll have a
sizable group of people," he said.</TE>

<HD>White House Reinterpreting Law on Environmental Reviews</HD>
<DH>The administration seeks to end red tape on federal lands,
but critics see a policy 'assault.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a series of efforts to limit the reach of the nation's bedrock
environmental law, the Bush administration is working to prevent
environmental impact statements from blocking or stalling energy
production, logging and other controversial uses of federal lands and
waters.</LD>
<LD>   From oceans to deserts, the administration is making the case that
the National Environmental Policy Act applies only to activities that
could potentially cause major environmental damage.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration argues that the 1969 law has become a
bureaucratic obstacle to action because it has been interpreted as
requiring environmental impact statements even when proposed actions
would obviously have no major effect. It says its goal is to cut red
tape, streamline decision making and get more done.</LD>
<TE>   "What we're trying to do is return [the law] to its original
vision as a tool that can help us make wise decisions," said Lynn
Scarlett, an assistant Interior secretary.</TE>
<TE>   But to Marty Hayden, legislative director of the environmental
legal group Earthjustice, the administration is conducting "a
systematic assault on our nation's premier environmental law."</TE>
<TE>   One typical case involves plans for managing the nation's 192
million acres of national forests, grasslands and prairies. A draft
proposal circulating within the administration would exempt all but
major changes to national forest management plans from the thorough
environmental reviews now required.</TE>
<TE>   The document says the new process would "allow for new plans,
amendments, or revisions to be categorically excluded from
documentation" in environmental impact statements.</TE>
<TE>   The management plans are important because they determine which
lands are targeted for mineral development, grazing or timber
harvests and which are preserved for wildlife, recreation or
wilderness. Omitting environmental impact statements could swing some
decisions in favor of commercial development.</TE>
<TE>   If the Bush administration's draft proposal goes into effect, the
U.S. Forest Service would still undertake lengthy environmental
impact statements when proposed forest plans represented major
changes from existing plans, according to Mark Rey, the Agriculture
undersecretary who oversees the Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   But comprehensive environmental reviews would become the exception
rather than the rule.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to do the level of environmental review that is
justified proportionate to the decision that is being made," Rey
said. For instance, the administration argues that it would not be a
good use of time and money to launch a full environmental impact
statement when officials are updating the forest plan for a smaller
eastern forest without any significant changes to guidelines or
standards, Rey said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have a different take. "The administration
appears intent on taking away the public's long-standing ability to
have a say in how their public lands are managed," said Linda Lance,
a vice president of the Wilderness Society, a national environmental
group.</TE>
<TE>   On average, forest plans take four to five years to develop and
cost $4 million to $5 million. The administration cannot say exactly
how much time and money is for the environmental analysis, but
Agriculture Department spokesman Dick Smith said it accounted for
more than half.</TE>
<TE>   The changes being introduced by the Bush administration directly
affect only the way the government does business, not the policies it
pursues. But the procedures can influence the policies, regardless of
who the president happens to be.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration, for example, was tripped up over its
Northwestern forest plan, which governs 19 national forests in
Oregon, Washington and Northern California within the range of
northern spotted owl. The Forest Service suggested relaxing the width
of the unlogged strip of forest that it was required to leave on
either side of intermittent streams to act as a buffer against
erosion.</TE>
<TE>   The rule had been 100 feet; the Forest Service proposed 50 feet.
Environmental groups and government scientists expressed concern that
the plan would make streams dirtier and their banks less hospitable
to wildlife. The final plan, finished in 1994, called for full-sized
forested buffers of at least 100 feet.</TE>
<TE>   On other fronts, the Bureau of Land Management, seeking to expand
domestic energy production, has repeatedly forgone environmental
impact statements for new projects, even when other federal agencies
urge such assessments.</TE>
<TE>   And the administration has proposed exempting from environmental
impact statements 10 large projects aimed at diminishing fire risk in
federal lands. It is seeking to speed up thinning and proscribed
burns on some of the most fire-prone federal lands, thus lessening
the risk of severe forest fires.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists charge that the administration's real goal is to
undertake large timber harvests without scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Navy has joined the debate, arguing that the law does not
apply beyond the 12 miles of territorial waters along the U.S.
coastline. In particular, the Navy wants to be excused from preparing
comprehensive analyses of the effect of its low-frequency sonar on
whales and other sea mammals.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists took the Navy to court, arguing that the law
applies throughout the so-called exclusive economic zone, which
extends to 200 miles offshore.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder in Los Angeles rejected
the administration's arguments last month, concluding that the law
applies not only in territorial waters but in the exclusive economic
zone.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists hope the defeat will deter the administration in
other environmental issues as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It was extremely important to rein in the Bush administration's
attack on the most fundamental environmental law that we have," said
Joel Reynolds, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, which brought the case.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, the administration does not seem deterred. Its quest
to open public lands for oil, gas and coal production has been
fertile ground for disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, the Bush administration opted not to undertake a
comprehensive environmental assessment of a large new oil and gas
exploration project in Utah's remote Book Cliffs region.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance and several other
environmental groups sued the Bureau of Land Management in September.</TE>
<TE>   The oil and gas project, which would be the largest ever in Utah,
would encompass seven areas that are also proposed wilderness areas.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Environmental Protection Agency commented that the
relatively brief environmental assessment conducted by the Bureau of
Land Management "does not adequately characterize the direct and
indirect effects to wildlife habitat and soils."</TE>
<TE>   Book Cliffs is the third seismic project in Utah approved by the
Bush administration without environmental impact statements. Another
was the decision to send large seismic "thumper" trucks into the Dome
Plateau area, home to several threatened and endangered species.
Several federal agencies had unsuccessfully urged the Bureau of Land
Management's Utah office to conduct a thorough environmental impact
review.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, a federal judge, agreeing that the exploration could
harm the fragile desert landscape, temporarily halted the project.</TE>

<HD>Candidate May Quit N.Y. Governor Race</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Billionaire Thomas Golisano, who has been running a strong third in
the governor's race as the Independence Party candidate, canceled
campaign appearances Saturday and scheduled an announcement for today
after Democrats asked him to drop out of the race and endorse their
candidate.</LD>
<LD>   "I am a candidate for governor of this state. I've put a lot of
effort into it, but there will be a special broadcast tomorrow
afternoon," Golisano said during a televised debate Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   When pressed for details, Golisano wouldn't elaborate.</LD>
<TE>   "There are some Democrats who are arguing to Mr. Golisano that he
should endorse Carl McCall," said Roger Stone, Golisano's chief
strategist. "I'm not saying he's decided to do that, but we are
getting entreaties to do so."</TE>
<TE>   After the debate, during which McCall and Golisano took turns
hammering at Republican Gov. George Pataki's tenure, McCall said he
had no idea what Golisano planned to do.</TE>
<TE>   Golisano and McCall have been trailing the governor in recent
polls.</TE>
<TE>   A Marist College survey released a week ago showed Pataki with
47%, followed by McCall with 27% and Golisano with 17%. When Golisano
was taken out of the equation, Pataki led McCall, 54% to 33%. The
poll of 432 likely voters had a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 5 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   "Just in and of itself, there's not enough Golisano numbers there
to change the outcome," Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said Saturday.
"There has to be an added impact for McCall to have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Miringoff said the best McCall could hope for is for Golisano to
quit the race and do heavy television advertising on Monday urging
New Yorkers to vote for McCall.</TE>
<TE>   Golisano has spent more than $54 million on his self-financed
campaign and run ads that have largely targeted Pataki's record as
governor. He recently canceled some television advertising, though an
aide said he was cutting back ads in New York City and Long Island to
focus on more traditionally conservative upstate voters.</TE>
<TE>   Pataki campaign spokesman Michael McKeon said it won't matter what
Golisano does.</TE>
<TE>   "Every poll has shown that half the Golisano support comes from us
and half comes from Carl McCall, and so if he ends up being a
quitter, then we expect the votes will return in about that
proportion," McKeon said.</TE>

<HD>Judge Keeps Young Sniper Suspect's Hearing Closed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Baltimore declined to allow open access to a court
hearing Monday for 17-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo, ruling that "enormous"
public interest in the Washington-area sniper case does not outweigh
the suspect's right to be shielded from scrutiny as a juvenile.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling came Friday on a motion by news organizations that
wanted to attend Monday's hearing. U.S. Magistrate Judge James K.
Bredar said he was not convinced that the public's interest in the
case warranted an exception to a federal law designed to protect
juveniles from public stigma that might hinder attempts to
rehabilitate them.</LD>
<LD>   Monday's hearing is to decide whether Malvo should be detained on
federal juvenile charges related to the sniper attacks, which killed
10 people and wounded three from Oct. 2 to 22. The proceeding could
include "embarrassing" and "delicate" testimony about his mental
health, family history and past conduct, Bredar said.</LD>
<TE>   "To release it publicly would potentially stigmatize this child,"
Bredar said.</TE>
<TE>   The motion by the Washington Post, Associated Press, the New York
Times and the Baltimore Sun sought to open all proceedings in Malvo's
case to the media and public, just as court proceedings for the other
suspect, John Allen Muhammad, 41, are open.</TE>

<HD>Death Toll at Trade Center Falls by 2</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The World Trade Center death toll has dropped by two to 2,795 after a
New York City woman and a Florida man who had been reported missing
after the terrorist attacks were found alive, city officials said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Police located Tina Spicer of Manhattan and Peter Montoulieu of
Miami more than a year after they were listed as terrorism victims,
and seven weeks after their names were read during the ground zero
anniversary ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   "It was verified that they are alive and well," said Police
Inspector Jeremiah Quinlan, who has overseen the trade center
missing-persons effort.</LD>
<TE>   Montoulieu told Associated Press on Friday that the closest he got
to the trade center last year was during a layover at New York's La
Guardia Airport about a week before the terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   He said his former wife reported him missing because she thought
he had attended a convention in Manhattan. He called police recently
after he learned that his name was on the victim list.</TE>
<TE>   "They were really happy to hear from me," said Montoulieu, 44.</TE>
<TE>   After city officials made the list public in anticipation of the
ground zero ceremony, several people listed as missing were found
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Officials did not say how the Spicer error was discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Quinlan said Spicer's mother reported her missing in the aftermath
of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of worried relatives and friends placed such calls,
causing the toll to swell to a peak of 6,700 about two weeks after

<TE>   At the ceremony, 2,801 names were read. Since then, five people

<HD>Pincay, Calkins Road Achieve Stated Purpose</HD>
<DH>Jockey guides 3-year-old to upset victory in the California
Cup Classic at Santa Anita. Valenzuela rides three winners.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Riding in the $1.325-million California Cup for the first time since
1999, jockey Patrick Valenzuela won three times, but the day's
biggest prize went to Laffit Pincay.</LD>
<LD>   At the expense of Valenzuela and his mount, Continental Red,
Pincay rallied on 10-1 shot Calkins Road to win the $250,000 Classic,
an eventful race from start to finish.</LD>
<LD>   Hot Market and Grey Memo, the first two betting choices in the
field of nine, had their chances compromised at different stages.</LD>
<TE>   A dedicated front-runner and the 5-2 second choice, Hot Market was
eliminated at the break when he reared in the gate and was away
behind the field. He did well to finish fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Grey Memo, a strong closer and the 5-2 favorite, was caught in
heavy traffic when rallying along the inside -- he appeared to be the
fastest horse -- and had to settle for fourth, beaten by about two
lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Their bad luck was good news for Calkins Road, who shows up on
days highlighting California-breds. Earlier this year, the 3-year-old
Illinois Storm colt won the Snow Chief, the feature event on Gold
Rush Day, which is Hollywood Park's answer to the California Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Calkins Road, owned and bred by Tom and Deborah Shapiro and
trained by John Shirreffs, prevailed by a head for his third win in
eight starts and gave Pincay his second Cal Cup Classic victory in
three years.</TE>
<TE>   "Laffit, John and Calkins Road did all the work," said Tom
Shapiro, the grandson of L.K. Shapiro, who owned the great Native
Diver, a local thoroughbred star of the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela, who trails Pincay, 27-25, in the jockey race heading
into the final day of the Oak Tree season, did most of his damage
earlier in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   A winner of five Cal Cup races before Saturday, Valenzuela swept
the early double with 5-1 shot Noble Kinsman in the $50,000 Starter
Handicap and favored Super High in the $150,000 Matron, then
completed his triple with 6-1 shot Unlimited Value in the $150,000
Sprint. Both Super High and Unlimited Value are owned by John Harris
and trained by Carla Gaines.</TE>
<TE>   The Sprint was marred by a nasty spill. Rio Oro, the 7-2 second
choice, suffered a fatal breakdown while battling for the lead around
the far turn and McCordnskuba, a 34-1 shot, also went down when
unable to avoid the fallen horse. McCordnskuba appeared OK afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Both riders, Kent Desormeaux on Rio Oro and Isaias Enriquez on
McCordnskuba, escaped serious injury, but Enriquez took off his final
mount on the card, saying he was sore.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Geli's Pie, the longshot he was to have ridden
in the $125,000 Juvenile Fillies, was scratched about 10 minutes
before post time.</TE>
<TE>   Pincay's other win came on a Cal Cup repeater. Lil Sister Stich,
who won the Distaff Starter Handicap in 2001, stepped up in the
$150,000 Distaff. The 3-1 favorite and 5-year-old daughter of Seattle
Bound won by a length over 25-1 shot Party Pirate in 1:13 1/5 at
about 6 1/2 furlongs on turf.</TE>
<TE>   The only other jockey with more than one win was Desormeaux. He
won the $50,000 Starter Sprint Handicap with 8-1 shot Giovannetti and
the $100,000 Distance Handicap with 5-2 favorite Nicole's Pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Stoney, the prohibitive 1-2 choice in the Starter Sprint, suffered
a leg injury early in the race. He was pulled up by jockey Victor
Espinoza and vanned off the track.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other California Cup winners were Crackup in the $125,000
Juvenile; Turkish Prize, who scored an 8-1 surprise in the $175,000
Mile; and Summer Wind Dancer, who surged past longshot Buttertart
near the wire in the $125,000 Juvenile Fillies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami Cartel, a 7-1 shot, beat 13-1 outsider Agouti by a head to
win the $288,950 Los Alamitos Derby late Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by James Azevedo and Charles Boyles and trained by Paul
Jones, who also trains Agouti, Miami Cartel completed the 400 yards
in 19.71 seconds under jockey Ramon Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   With the win, Miami Cartel, a son of Corona Cartel, earned a spot
in the Champion of Champions next month.</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Piatkowski Will Start at Shooting Guard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Piatkowski will return to the starting lineup as the Clipper
shooting guard today against the Detroit Pistons. Quentin Richardson
will move into a reserve role.</LD>
<LD>   That's the way the Clippers played it last season, when Piatkowski
got them rolling with accurate outside shooting and Richardson gave
them a boost whenever he entered the game.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not a major change," Coach Alvin Gentry said after
Saturday's practice at Los Angeles Southwest College, wishing to make
it clear the team's 0-2 start to the season shouldn't be blamed on a
lack of production at the shooting guard spot.</LD>
<TE>   Piatkowski and Richardson said the change was fine with them.
Neither had a good game in the Clippers' loss Friday against the
Lakers. Piatkowski scored seven points in 12 minutes. Richardson had
10 points on two-for-eight shooting in 20 minutes. Marko Jaric,
another guard, did not score in 26 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Mentally, the most important thing is knowing you're going to get
a certain amount of minutes," Piatkowski said. "You're going to play
the first quarter and the third quarter and if you're having a good
game, you'll play some in the fourth. When you're coming off the
bench it's tough. You're always asking yourself, 'When am I going to
go in? When am I going to go in?' In certain situations, you might
not get in the game at all."</TE>
<TE>   Said Richardson: "Coach had told me in the summer I had definitely
earned the position. He also told me this isn't about whether I'm
better than Pike or whether Pike is better than me. [Gentry] feels he
needs something off the bench. He feels I'm best coming off the
bench. I don't care as long as we win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry on the Clippers' slow start: "We're not 0-25. There's no
reason to panic. We're 0-2. We had a tough start the first year I was
here. We didn't get off to a good start last year. We're a long way
from panicking."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Proves Relentless in 9-0 Rout of Panama</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Monica Franco must have felt like the proverbial duck in a shooting
gallery. A tall duck, to be sure, but a duck nonetheless.</LD>
<LD>   And Tiffeny Milbrett was the shotgun.</LD>
<LD>   It was Franco's misfortune Saturday night to be in the nets for
Panama at a time when the United States women's national team, and
Milbrett in particular, decided to take target practice en route to a
9-0 victory.</LD>
<TE>   And so for Franco, a 19-year-old, wet-behind-the-ears goalkeeper
from the University of Panama, this is how the first half of the
CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup game at Safeco Field went in front of a
stunned crowd of 21,522:</TE>
<TE>   2:58 -- Goal Milbrett, from an Aly Wagner pass.</TE>
<TE>   4:53 -- Goal Milbrett, from a Wagner pass.</TE>
<TE>   8:24 -- Goal Milbrett, from a Shannon MacMillan pass.</TE>
<TE>   11:45 -- Goal MacMillan, from an Abby Wambach pass.</TE>
<TE>   13:06 -- Goal MacMillan, from an Angela Hucles pass.</TE>
<TE>   21:45 -- Goal Milbrett, from a Wagner pass.</TE>
<TE>   33:57 -- Goal Milbrett, unassisted.</TE>
<TE>   39:53 -- Goal Tiffany Roberts, from a Wambach pass.</TE>
<TE>   No one was more relieved to hear the halftime whistle than Franco,
who did her best but was powerless against a U.S. team that seemed
intent on sending a message to Canada, which had won its first two
Gold Cup games by scores of 11-1 and 9-0.</TE>
<TE>   The teams are on course to meet in the final Saturday at the Rose
Bowl, and Saturday night's impressive performance made it clear that
the Canadians are not the only ones with firepower.</TE>
<TE>   Milbrett's five first-half strikes tied a U.S. record for most
goals in a game set by Brandi Chastain against Mexico in 1991 and
equaled later that year by Michelle Akers against Taiwan during the
first Women's World Cup in China.</TE>
<TE>   Milbrett's night ended before she had the chance to make the
record her own. Ten minutes into the second half, she twisted her
right knee and left the game. The U.S. already had used its permitted
three substitutes and had to play a woman short for the last 35
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was absolutely panicked," said U.S. Coach April Heinrichs. "The
way that she turned, I saw her turn, I saw her fall, and I was
absolutely convinced she had torn her ACL [anterior cruciate
ligament].</TE>
<TE>   "To have to go a year without Tiffeny Milbrett would have been a
devastating blow."</TE>
<TE>   But Milbrett shook off the injury and was able to laugh about it
afterward, having tripped herself by catching one shoe in the other
while turning.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like we came out and played well, did what we had to do,"
she said. "We really wanted to work on getting behind [opposing
defenses]. I was actually surprised that we were able to find the
space that we did [to attack]. There were some great balls out of the
midfield. That makes my job so much easier because I can be a forward
and be a finisher.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great to be out there, great to finish them [the scoring
chances] and great to finish No. 1 in our group."</TE>
<TE>   Even without Milbrett, the Americans continued to attack, but
Franco came up with a big foot-save in the 67th minute to deny
Wambach, the 2002 Women's United Soccer Assn. rookie of the year who
had been added to the U.S. roster Friday after teenage forward
Heather O'Reilly was sidelined for the rest of the tournament because
of a hip flexor injury.</TE>
<TE>   Wambach also hit the right post with a shot in the 83rd minute,
but made up for that miss with a goal two minutes later off a pass
from Hucles.</TE>
<TE>   And so it ended up at 9-0, not quite surpassing Canada's lopsided
victories over Haiti and Jamaica, but three times more satisfying
than the U.S. team's earlier 3-0 shutouts of Mexico and Trinidad and
Tobago.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Heinrichs said she was not looking beyond Wednesday's
semifinals, when the U.S. is expected to play Costa Rica, unless the
Central Americans somehow manage to upset Canada today in Victoria,
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a player on our team thinking about Canada
right now," she said. "I think our focus has been to make sure that
we advanced in the finest fashion that we could and I think we'll
take our semifinal game with tremendous respect."</TE>
<TE>   In the first half of Saturday night's doubleheader, Mexico secured
its place in the semifinals by blanking Trinidad and Tobago, on two
goals by Monica Gerardo in the 6th and 60th minutes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's rare a Santa Ana Mater Dei football team feels it isn't getting
respect and even more rare when the Monarchs are underdogs. Win five
Southern Section titles in 11 years as Mater Dei has done and you'll
usually enter a game a respected favorite. Not so against Anaheim
Servite.</LD>
<LD>   Servite has its best team in nearly two decades, one that seemed
destined to end a 13-game winless streak against Mater Dei that
includes a 0-0 tie in 1992. This was supposed to be one of the weaker
Mater Dei teams in years, one Servite should handle without a
problem. But showing a drive to prove it still belongs among Southern
California's elite, Mater Dei rolled to a 24-7 victory Saturday night
at Cal State Fullerton and moved into a first-place tie with
Bellflower St. John Bosco in the Serra League.</LD>
<LD>   "We felt challenged going into this game," Mater Dei Coach Bruce
Rollinson said. "We felt that perhaps we weren't getting enough
respect. There were some comments made and everyone was saying that
this was not one of the best Mater Dei teams in years, but now we're
sitting at 7-1 and in first place."</LD>
<TE>   The Monarchs (7-1, 3-0 in league play), ranked No. 9 by The Times
and No. 4 in the Division I poll, dominated the line of scrimmage and
executed an option-based veer offense to perfection. Quarterback
Jason Forcier, a sophomore, had 191 yards and a touchdown in 17
carries.</TE>
<TE>   The Mater Dei defense allowed a 68-yard touchdown on Servite's
second play from scrimmage, then allowed only 182 yards the rest of
the game.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Rafael Rice added 62 yards and two touchdowns in 15
carries for Mater Dei, which gained 402 total yards, 318 rushing.</TE>
<TE>   Servite (7-1, 2-1), No. 8 in The Times' rankings and No. 3 in the
Division I, crossed into Mater Dei territory just three times after
its early score.</TE>
<TE>   Forcier ran 62 yards out of the option on the first play of the
game to set up a 22-yard field goal by Jerry Corona and a 3-0 Mater
Dei lead. Servite answered with a 68-yard run by Conor Martin.</TE>
<TE>   -- Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Loyola 7, Santa Margarita 0 -- Bo Renaud rushed for 147 yards
and a touchdown with 44 seconds to play in the first quarter in 20
carries for the host Cubs (6-2, 1-2) in a Serra League victory at
Glendale High.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola, despite 165 yards of offense and two missed field goals,
kept its playoff hopes alive.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles (5-3, 0-3) were without running back Ashton White, who
sat out for the second consecutive week because of a sore knee.
White, who has rushed for 805 yards and eight touchdowns, was
replaced by Chase McWhorter, who rushed 13 times for 28 yards. Santa
Margarita had 106 yards of offense.</TE>

<HD>CIF Meeting Generates Questions</HD>

<LD>The California Interscholastic Federation emerged from its federated
council meeting Friday at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near Los Angeles
International Airport with a lengthy list of issues to resolve before
deciding whether to add more high school state championships.</LD>
<LD>   The council generated questions ranging from the philosophical
(Whose interests would be served by more state championships?) to the
logistical (Where would championship games be played?). The council
agreed to find as many answers as possible before returning for
further discussion at its next meeting in February.</LD>
<LD>   The CIF currently offers state championships in boys' and girls'
basketball, track and field, cross-country, wrestling and girls'
volleyball.</LD>
<TE>   Adding championships is not an easy task, considering the CIF is
broken into 10 sections. Not all sports are played in all sections
and some sports are played in different seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Another issue is the set of criteria to be used to determine entry
into a state playoff system.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Section Commissioner Jim Staunton voiced disappointment
that he was unable to present his proposal to create state
championships in boys' and girls' golf. The council agreed to resolve
more wide-ranging issues before considering individual proposals.</TE>

<LD>When pitcher Ta'Tyana McElroy of L.A. Washington High signs a letter
of intent with Oregon State next week, Bob Dylan's 1964 song, "The
Times They Are a-Changin' " would be an appropriate musical
accompaniment.</LD>
<LD>   McElroy will become the first African American softball player at
Oregon State and the first player from the softball component of
Reviving Baseball in Innercities to earn a scholarship to a Pacific
10 Conference school.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a breakthrough," Crenshaw High Coach Frank Price said.</LD>
<TE>   RBI was launched in 1989 by former major league scout John Young
to reinvigorate baseball participation in South Central Los Angeles
and other urban communities. Young's goal was to use baseball to help
youths overcome academic and social disadvantages. The program has
spread to more than 160 cities.</TE>
<TE>   Softball leagues were added in 1997, and they could end up having
a greater impact in putting girls on the path to college.</TE>
<TE>   "The girls are easier," Young said. "The boys come in thinking
they're going to play in the big league, and until that June day when
they're not drafted, they're not thinking of college."</TE>
<TE>   RBI has teamed with the Department of Recreation and Parks to run
leagues for baseball and softball. There are more than 1,600 boys and
girls participating from ages 8 to 18. Grants from Major League
Baseball and the Amateur Athletic Foundation have provided funding.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, RBI formed an 18-and-under gold softball team to travel
around the country and compete in top summer tournaments. Playing for
a club team has become virtually the only way to receive a softball
scholarship because summer is when most scouting takes place.</TE>
<TE>   The cost for a club player can be as high as $5,000 for travel
expenses and fees. Thanks to donations from Dodger pitcher Kevin
Brown, San Fernando Valley resident Liz Shapiro and others, RBI does
not charge its players and requires only that its girls participate
in a community service program.</TE>
<TE>   The team is made up of African American and Latina players from
some of the toughest neighborhoods in Los Angeles. There's no denying
what the team has meant for the girls' future.</TE>
<TE>   "For some of the girls, it's kept them out of trouble," McElroy
said. "I know one girl who was always in trouble. It gives her
something to look forward to."</TE>
<TE>   McElroy has been the team's top pitcher. She had extra guidance to
succeed. Her brother, Jim, was a wide receiver at UCLA from 1994 to
'97. Her father, Jim Sr., has been her coach at Washington and with
RBI. She was talented enough to play for a more high-profile club
team but stayed loyal to RBI.</TE>
<TE>   "It is exciting, especially to see my friends come up and
accomplish so much," she said.</TE>
<TE>   No one has benefited more from RBI than Kenora Posey, a junior
infielder at Crenshaw who has 113 stolen bases in the last two
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Young remembers Posey as an 11-year-old hanging out at a park in
South Central Los Angeles. She was known for her speed and "beating
up boys."</TE>
<TE>   She joined RBI and is considered the second-best player, next to
McElroy. UCLA, the eight-time NCAA softball champion, sent a
recruiting questionnaire to Posey, the first time the school has
requested any information from one of Price's players.</TE>
<TE>   "This kid used to climb out of windows at home at night," Price
said. "She was clearly lacking something in her life."</TE>
<TE>   David Blakely, program director at 109th Street Park, is amazed at
the changes Posey has made since joining the softball program.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a piece of coal who turned into a diamond," he said. "I
see the maturity, 'yes sir,' 'no sir,' the use of the English
language, not the slang."</TE>
<TE>   Said Posey: "If it wasn't for RBI, I'd be in a very bad situation.
It's helped me get this far and I wouldn't give it up for anything."</TE>
<TE>   For players to reach college, they need good grades and a
qualifying SAT score. RBI pays for its players to enroll in an SAT
preparation class and hires academic tutors, which is something Posey
is relying on to improve her college chances.</TE>
<TE>   RBI has sent softball players to Alabama State, Southern
University and St. John's, but McElroy's arrival in the premier
softball conference in America will be a turning point. College
coaches know there are others ready to join her.</TE>
<TE>   "I know for a fact that we are missing a tremendous group of
athletes from the inner city, and I get excited knowing they are
starting to get the exposure and opportunities they deserve," UCLA
softball Coach Sue Enquist said.</TE>
<TE>   Jim McElroy Sr. said there's still a challenge trying to convince
girls to choose softball as their sport to focus on.</TE>
<TE>   "You figure the average inner-city girl thinks softball is what
you do at a family picnic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't know how intense it is. They don't understand about
scholarships. They all think it's for basketball and track and
field."</TE>
<TE>   There's no telling how many lives have been changed because of
Young's vision and dedication to reaching boys and girls in the inner
cities of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "John Young has been a hero," Price said. "He can't leap buildings
in a single bound. He's not bulletproof, but he's saving lives."</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 13, when McElroy makes it official and signs with Oregon
State, she'll be setting the standard for others to follow.</TE>
<TE>   "It opens up doors for girls," her father said.</TE>

<LD>As the students filter single-file through the door of the main
building, they flash school ID cards before a security guard,
confirming they are entitled to leave campus for the day.</LD>
<LD>   On a comfortable fall afternoon, they all meet the
school-prescribed dress code: tan pants or tan skirts and cardinal
red or white sweatshirts.</LD>
<LD>   Back inside, the athletic facilities begin to bustle with
afternoon activities.</LD>
<TE>   At the indoor pool, surrounded by walls draped with one
championship banner after another, the water churns as swim team
members take their daily laps.</TE>
<TE>   The floor of the freshly painted gymnasium fills with dozens of
enthusiastic volleyball players, and the football team heads onto the
field of the 5,000-seat stadium, ready to tackle another day of
practice.</TE>
<TE>   It's a setting that might be considered commonplace at any of the
Southland's private high schools, but this is Long Beach Wilson, a
public school of about 4,300 students located on the city's east
side.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, like a lot of private schools, has made its name in
athletics by succeeding in sports more commonly enjoyed on family
vacations. This fall has been no exception.</TE>
<TE>   The boys' water polo and girls' volleyball teams are favored to
retain their Southern Section Division I titles this month, and the
girls' golf team also sits atop The Times' top 10 rankings. The
girls' cross-country team made its debut in the top 10 in October,
giving Wilson a spot in four of the seven fall rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "Wilson has always done well in the country club-type sports,"
said Jim Ferguson, the boys' and girls' golf coach. "We're fortunate
in that we draw kids from some of the more affluent families in Long
Beach."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson has grown more attractive in recent years because it has
begun mixing private school qualities with public school access.</TE>
<TE>   Alli Dillon, a senior setter on the Bruins' volleyball team,
attended private schools for nine years before enrolling at Wilson as
a freshman. She was set to go to Lakewood St. Joseph, a private
school, but at the last moment decided to follow her older brother to
Wilson. She hasn't regretted her decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Academics are just as high a priority [at Wilson], if not higher,
than at a private school," she said. "The rules we have to follow
give us a bigger reputation to live up to."</TE>
<TE>   In February 1997, the board of education for the Long Beach
Unified School District, in an effort to establish stronger standards
for academic achievement and dress, approved the transformation of
Wilson into Wilson Classical High School.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson students are enrolled in seven classes a day -- one more
than at most high schools -- and are required to take four years of a
foreign language, as well as four years of science, math and English,
three years of history and social science, two years of fine arts and
one year of technology.</TE>
<TE>   Students and their parents must sign a contract in which they
agree to meet the school's attendance, conduct and homework
requirements. Failure to comply may result in dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   The program was phased in over four years, beginning in 1997 with
the freshman class.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't all work and no play at Wilson, where Rick Jones, the
boys' athletic director the last 13 years, estimates that between
half and three-quarters of the students participate in
extracurricular activities.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said turnouts in some sports have been staggering. About 70
athletes participate in the water polo program, between 120 and 140
tried out for soccer last winter and another 100 went out for
baseball last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids who come here know about the school and are proud of the
school," Wilson Principal Keith Hansen said. "They start to develop
that winning attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who began coaching water polo at Wilson in 1977, said a
stable coaching staff is a key reason for the school's success in the
so-called minor sports.</TE>
<TE>   He said the school rarely has a coaching position open, and when
it does, he fields dozens of applications.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson, who coached the Wilson boys' basketball team from 1977
to '92, has been at the school for 26 years. Klaus Barth, the boys'
swimming coach, is in his 20th year at the school, and James Arquilla
has spent 19 seasons coaching boys' cross-country.</TE>
<TE>   Even Tony Martinho, in only his fourth season as boys' water polo
coach, has a long relationship with the school. He played on the
Bruins' first Southern Section championship team in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson has only two varsity head coaches who are not teachers at
the school.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things I truly believe has created a great deal of
success," Jones said, "is that [nearly] all of the head coaches are
educators."</TE>
<TE>   Said volleyball player Dillon: "We have a lot of support among the
administration and the teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "When an article is in the paper, they talk about it in class and
put it up in the rooms. They encourage us to get involved outside of
the classroom."</TE>
<TE>   Hansen said one of the biggest goals for Wilson's teachers and
administrators is to ensure their athletes are qualified to play at
the next level.</TE>
<TE>   "When a student comes here, they're going to concentrate on being
a scholarship athlete," Hansen said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing more discouraging than to see kids get accepted
at a certain college and then don't play because of grades. We don't
want to be in that boat."</TE>

<LD>If the showdown between Tates Creek and Voodoo Dancer in today's
$200,000 Las Palmas Handicap at Santa Anita is even half as good as
their last one, racing fans are in for quite a treat.</LD>
<LD>   The fillies to beat in the Grade II, one of two stakes on the
closing day card, last got together in the Diana Handicap, also a
Grade II, on July 27 at Saratoga. In an extremely tight finish, Tates
Creek, a 7-2 shot, prevailed by a nose over Voodoo Dancer.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, Tates Creek, who began her career in California, has
won two of three, including a Grade III at Belmont, while Voodoo
Dancer won the Palomar at Del Mar before finishing second to Golden
Apples in the Yellow Ribbon here last month.</LD>
<TE>   Today's 1 1/8-mile turf race attracted eight others, but Surya and
longshot Polaire are expected to be scratched. Noches De Rosa, I'm
The Business, Desiraes My Candy, Tout Charmant, Crazy Ensign and
Magic Mission round out the field.</TE>
<TE>   About an hour earlier, course specialist El Cielo will make his
first start since Jan. 26 against Eddie Read Handicap winner Sarafan
and eight others in the $100,000 Morvich Handicap at about 6 1/2
furlongs on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Century City, who won four of eight in Europe and
once finished second to the brilliant Rock Of Gibraltar, heads the
field in the $100,000 Bay Meadows Derby, the closing day feature.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Is It True Mex. The gelding won for the 10th time in 15
starts on the turf on Oct. 26 and will make his graded stakes debut
in the Morvich Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Liane Davis. The Illinois-based trainer is two for 47
in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: Pick three singling J. Cash in the second,
Gratis, Sir Bertrando and Mr. Powerful in the third and Irish Nip,
Cat Flight, Rafid and Ice Prince in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/72. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $37.80/$421.80. Total money bet: $442.</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Joins Practice for 15 Minutes</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recovery of Shaquille O'Neal continues to resemble climbing Mt.
Everest. Every day is another step closer, but progress can seem
incremental.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal, who is on the injured list while healing from off-season
toe surgery, practiced with the team for about 15 minutes Saturday,
running the full court at times, playing in the half court at other
times. It was his second practice since the surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, O'Neal -- who took himself out whenever he tired --
said there was no pain in the surgically repaired area, although "the
bottom of my foot is hurtin'; hopefully it will go away." He said he
is more concerned with getting back into basketball shape than any
setbacks with the toe.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of people like to come [into the season] in 100% basketball
shape," O'Neal said. "I like to come in about 85% and have something
to work to. It's easier for me to start at 85% and get to 100% than
it is for me to come in at 100% and stay there. That's been my
secret. That's why other guys wear out before I do.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now I'm about 75%. A couple more sprints, a couple more
days, and I think I'll be all right. I want to give us at least 20
points and 10 rebounds in 25-30 minutes. If I can do that, I'll be
OK."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he would be evaluated again this week. "[The doctors]
say if I feel pain, don't push it."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson is encouraged by O'Neal's progress. "He looks
good, he's moving well. He's still working on timing on some things,
but his offense is going well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark Madsen, recovering from a pulled hamstring, is a role player,
but that doesn't mean he hasn't been missed.</TE>
<TE>   Madsen still does not have a definitive return date and has been
told to take it slowly.</TE>
<TE>   "With a hamstring you have to be careful," Madsen said. "I've been
working out a little more each day. The key right now is to not get
too gung-ho and be smart about it. But I feel I'm on schedule. I'm
hoping I can return soon."</TE>

<TE>   Kobe Bryant, who had the fourth triple-double of his career in
Friday's victory over the Clippers, had some swelling in the left
ankle he had sprained against Portland on Wednesday and was held out
of most of Saturday's workout.</TE>
<TE>   But Jackson said he expected Bryant to be ready for tonight's
game.</TE>

<TE>   Update  -- Phil Jackson is glad the Lakers get another shot at
Portland so soon after the Trail Blazers ripped his team, 102-90. "We
won three of the quarters the other night, but the quarter we lost
was devastating," Jackson said. "But that's the challenge you keep
offering your team -- go out and win the quarters, and worry about
the score when it's all over." Tonight's game will be the fourth in
five nights for the Trail Blazers.</TE>

<HD>Nets' Victory Is Pure Kidd's Play</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Kidd finished off Michael Jordan and the Washington Wizards.</LD>
<LD>   Kidd and Jordan each reentered the game with 7:10 remaining, when
the New Jersey Nets were making two free throws for a five-point
lead.</LD>
<LD>   From there, Kidd took over -- and Jordan was a nonfactor. Kidd
stole the ball from Jerry Stackhouse, converted the layup and added
four more points in a 19-7 run to lead the Nets over the Wizards,
87-79, Saturday night at Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The Nets had five players score in double figures, led by Kidd's
18 points. New Jersey is 3-0, and Washington in three games has gone
from very bad to very good to not good enough to beat the defending
Eastern Conference champions.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason Kidd showed why he is talked about as being the MVP of the
league," Washington Coach Doug Collins said. "He came in and had a
little stretch there of about three minutes where he just changed the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan finished with 21 points. Stackhouse led Washington with 23
points.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 100, Milwaukee 90 -- Tracy McGrady scored 47 points and
the Magic ended an eight-game losing streak at Milwaukee's Bradley
Center.</TE>
<TE>   McGrady came within three points of his career high of 50 points,
set against Washington last season.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 87, Minnesota 80 -- Brad Miller had 22 points and 16
rebounds, and Jermaine O'Neal had 21 points and 14 rebounds to lift
the Pacers at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers held Kevin Garnett to 12 points on four-for-16
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 117, New York 107 -- Paul Pierce scored 46 points,
including 14 in the fourth quarter, for the Celtics at Madison Square
Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce finished two points shy of his career high set last season,
scoring 14 of Boston's last 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 116, Memphis 99 -- Vlade Divac scored 24 points, one of
six Sacramento players to score in double figures at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings had little trouble with the Grizzlies despite playing
without Chris Webber, who sat out because of an abdominal strain.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 98, Chicago 92 -- Glenn Robinson became the first Hawk to
score 30 points in three consecutive games to start a season.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Terry scored 23 points for the host Hawks. The Bulls fell
short of their first 3-0 start since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 88, Toronto 76 -- Steve Francis scored 28 points to lead
the Rockets at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto's Vince Carter left with 6:17 to go in the first quarter
because of a strained left knee and did not return. Carter sat out
the last 14 games last season after surgery to repair the same knee.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 100, Miami 95 -- Jamal Mashburn had 35 points at New
Orleans to lead the Hornets against his former team.</TE>
<TE>   Mashburn made a jump shot near the top of the key and a free throw
in the last minute to stave off a rally by the Heat, which trailed by
as many as 11 points in the fourth quarter after leading by 12 points
at the half.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 97, Phoenix 83 -- Dirk Nowitzki scored 22 points and
Michael Finley scored eight of his 17 points during a third-quarter
run that sparked the Mavericks in their home opener.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas starter Raef LaFrentz sprained his right ankle early in the
third quarter. He did not return.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 101, Golden State 92 -- Karl Malone scored 26 points at Salt
Lake City, and the Jazz averted its first 0-3 start since 1979.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz defeated the Warriors for the 24th time in their last 25
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Denver 96, Portland 79 -- James Posey had 19 points, 14 rebounds
and 10 assists at Portland, Ore., and the Nuggets won for the first
time this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuggets dominated the second half even without forward Juwan
Howard, who sat out because of a stomach virus.</TE>

<HD>Hornets Haven't Created Much Buzz</HD>

<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hi ho, hi ho, it's back to work they go: Hopefully everyone got their
rest because it's not easy these days, even with giants walking the
earth.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers and Boston Celtics of the '80s revived the NBA, the
Chicago Bulls carried it to its zenith in the '90s, but the modern
Lakers just won three titles while the league waits for a halo
effect.</LD>
<LD>   The salary cap just shrank -- meaning revenues fell -- for the
first time. With the '90s arena boom receding into history, most of
the openers failed to sell out.</LD>
<TE>   After 16 years without a move, two franchises have relocated in
two seasons, with Michael Heisley forsaking Vancouver for smaller
Memphis (and an arena-deal payoff from FedEx) and Hornet owners
George Shinn and Ray Wooldridge, who alienated Charlotte, fleeing to
New Orleans, which has better ambience but worse demographics.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte has a vibrant economy. New Orleans is so small, the NFL
Saints say they struggle to sell 40,000 season tickets and they play
only eight home games.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets listed their opener as a sellout, despite empty seats
in the lower bowl of New Orleans Arena. Meanwhile, ebullient co-owner
Shinn, long dormant in North Carolina, resurfaced, crowing he was
"back where I belong, at the lead role of this franchise."</TE>
<TE>   You could get an argument about where he belongs. In
basketball-mad Charlotte, they sold out their 23,000-seat arena for
10 seasons in a row. In party-mad New Orleans, the streak was
expected to end at one game.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Shinn suggests the team might have worked things out
with Charlotte officials ... were it not for Wooldridge.</TE>
<TE>   "With me and all my baggage ... it seemed like the reasonable
thing to do so I just turned it completely over to Ray," Shinn told
the Charlotte Observer, referring to his being accused of sexual
assault but found not guilty in a long-running civil trial.</TE>
<TE>   "I got feedback that Ray was upsetting people, handling things
wrong, showing up late to meetings, not showing up at all. I was told
that. I know that Ray has a strong personality that some people find
abrasive.... I was convinced that he was just doing a good job, that
he was a better negotiator, that he was outmaneuvering them and that
therefore they were disliking him because he was successful....</TE>
<TE>   "Do I think things would have been different if I had been doing
the negotiations? That's hard to say."</TE>
<TE>   Shinn's new marketing strategy includes hiding Wooldridge and
becoming "the only team, I think, in professional sports that will
have a prayer before every home game."</TE>
<TE>   The first was delivered not by a member of the clergy but by New
Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, who appeared to be unfamiliar with the usual
protocol.</TE>
<TE>   "We ask two things, Heavenly Father," intoned Nagin, "that the
Hornets beat the Jazz tonight and that New Orleans wins an NBA
championship this year."</TE>
<TE>   This embarrassed visiting Commissioner David Stern, who had
already been obliged to acknowledge his doubts about the city. ("You
have to be skeptical. You can lay out the demographics of New
Orleans, talk about corporate presence, income, education.... ") Now
Stern had to take a position on prayer (he thought it should be
personal).</TE>
<TE>   As if to make it up to Charlotte, or compounding the shame, Stern
awarded it yet another expansion team, although not at the 1988 price
of $35 million.</TE>
<TE>   This time the tab will be more like $350 million.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, when there's a $10.2-million windfall for each of the other
29 teams -- including the Hornets -- you bet your sweet life you can
go home again.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't [vote against it] for a lot of reasons," Shinn told
the New Orleans Times-Picayune. "One of them is a $10-million reason
that we'll get if they get an expansion team. So I'm not stupid. I
want the thing to work."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, everyone has ratings/franchise issues. Los Angeles is
in its eighth season without an NFL team. Fox Sports' Ed Goren just
predicted the World Series would, at least, beat last spring's
four-game NBA Finals, after which the Series went seven games and
posted its lowest all-time rating.</TE>
<TE>   Better times await someone, presumably.</TE>
<TE>   Rough Week in Paradise</TE>
<TE>   * Locally, where everyone has been spoiled by the Laker dynasty
and the rise of the exciting, young Clippers, things were a little
bumpy. The entertainment (Randy Newman, Santana, Michelle Branch) was
top-notch, but the teams started a combined 0-3.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, they met Friday night, meaning someone had to get a
win.</TE>
<TE>   The victorious Lakers, of course, will soon be the team of
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant again, but until then, have some
problems.</TE>
<TE>   At full strength, they have (just) enough role players, but they
have never found the big man to back up O'Neal. Nor are they getting
warmer.</TE>
<TE>   Jelani McCoy (now starting in Toronto), Greg Foster and John
Salley were all better than Soumaila Samake. Actually, since Salley
gets $600,000 from the Lakers this season, they could call him. He's
only 38 and would love the attention.</TE>
<TE>   After escaping Sacramento last spring, the Lakers talked privately
about Charles Oakley. Then they stomped the New Jersey Nets and their
sense of urgency seemed to dissipate, along with their appetite for a
mouthy tough guy on his last legs.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, big men went every which way, especially to rivals who
knew they had to attack in waves. The Kings got Keon Clark for the
$4.5-million exception. The San Antonio Spurs added Kevin Willis and
Mengke Bateer on minimum-salary deals.</TE>
<TE>   Last week Phil Jackson, exuding calm, as usual, joked about going
0-7 but it was more like advance notice just in case, hoping to avert
panic in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, by now Phil can handle these things in his sleep.</TE>
<TE>   "We played the last year ... in Chicago without [Scottie] Pippen
until January and we anticipated the same thing," said Jackson. "We
started off slow. We ended up still tying Utah for the best record in
the league."</TE>
<TE>   Pippen got back so late because he was angry with management,
which wasn't going to re-sign him, and postponed his surgery until
just before camp.</TE>
<TE>   The spring before, Jackson, also estranged from the front office,
was given a window to entertain offers from other teams and actually
did -- while the Bulls were still playing.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls started that last season 12-9 while Pippen called owner
Jerry Reinsdorf a liar.</TE>
<TE>   Now that was a mess.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the Eastern Conference didn't have challengers
as good as the Kings or Spurs. You remember how hard it was for the
Lakers to get out of the West last season? It hasn't gotten any
easier.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, problems are one thing. Hopelessness is another.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, composed mostly of young players inevitably fixated
on long-term contracts, was dismayed en masse when owner Donald T.
Sterling failed to re-sign Michael Olowokandi or Elton Brand.</TE>
<TE>   Time will tell if they can get past it, and not much time either.
Their season is two games old and already teetering.</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   Not that Bill Walton isn't capable of saying something that hurt
O'Neal's feelings, but weight is the wrong issue to get defensive
about. It's true that even at 350 to 360 pounds, Shaq can play at
pretty close to his usual level, suggesting to him that it's OK.
However, there's no way that the extra stress on his feet and joints
can be anything but destructive. This isn't likely to be the last
time he's hurt.... Hello, Dark Ages: The New York Knicks, who ran
their sellout streak to nine seasons by whatever accounting means
necessary, now have tickets available for all games. The end of the
streak -- 433 after Saturday's home opener -- is expected Monday....
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time: These days, it takes a
few games before all the guys who were suspended over the summer are
back. Dallas Maverick Coach Don Nelson and his assistant/son Donnie,
had to miss the opener for watching draft-ineligible players work out
in Yugoslavia. While the team cruised in Memphis, owner Mark Cuban
sponsored a party at a Dallas restaurant, which the Nelsons attended
in black-and-white-striped prison suits.... The Knicks' Antonio
McDyess suffered his season-ending knee injury with 1:55 left in an
exhibition, after playing 38 minutes. Said Net Coach Byron Scott:
"I'd just never play my guys a lot of minutes in the preseason. If
that's going to happen to my guys, it's going to happen in the first
quarter because they're not going to be in it in the fourth." Fumed
Knick Coach Don Chaney: "I run this team the way I run this team."</TE>
<TE>   That's so both of you: In a Utah Jazz intrasquad game, Karl
Malone, claiming his team had been short-changed, harangued a PR aide
into putting two more points on the scoreboard. Then John Stockton,
playing on the other team, got so upset, the aide gave his team two
more points too.... At a symposium of commissioners, the NHL's Gary
Bettman praised his owners, at which point his old boss, Stern,
joked, "Quit sucking up to your owners." Replied Bettman: "I learned
that from the master."</TE>

<LD>MARK HEISLER'S NBA RANKINGS AND COMMENTS:</LD>
<LD>   Michael Jordan comes off the bench for limited minutes (46 in the
first two games) but Jerry Stackhouse and comers Kwame Brown and
Jared Jeffries make this an intriguing mix. Shaquille O'Neal isn't
expected back until after this game, which would make the Lakers the
underdogs.</LD>
<TE>*--*
Rank  Team (rec.)          Comment
1     SACRAMENTO (3-0)     On one hand, Bibby out five weeks. On
                           other, it doesn't look as if Kings notice
2     NEW JERSEY  (3-0)    New starter Jefferson averaging 15. New
                           center Mutombo averaging 3.0 blocks
3     SAN ANTONIO (2-1)    Retiring Admiral, who used to hit snooze
                           alarm until New Year's, averaging 11-11
4     DALLAS (2-0)         All Mavericks' work on defense paid off as
                           they give up 108 to Memphis
5     DETROIT  (2-0)       East Euro-theme: Last year it was 6-11
                           Zeljko Rebraca, now 6-10 Mehmet Okur
6     INDIANA  (2-1)       Young, promising like Clippers -- except
                           Pacers just re-signed Bender and Artest
7     MINNESOTA (2-1)      Young, promising like Clippers -- except
                           Timberwolves just re-signed Szczerbiak
8     NEW ORLEANS  (2-1)   Baron zinged for trying to take over U.S.
                           team in summer; Hornets say it's OK
9     PHILADELPHIA  (2-1)  Return of Keith Van Horn: He averages 18
                           points, nine rebounds in first three
10    SEATTLE  (2-0)       May have sold soul over summer: Brent
                           Barry gets 50 points in first two games
11    PORTLAND  (1-2)      Payroll $106 million -- meaning Trail
                           Blazers will pay $50 million in tax
12    WASHINGTON  (1-2)    H-e-r-e's Kwame: 20-year-old arrives in a
                           hurry, getting 33-24 in first two
13    PHOENIX  (1-2)       Good news is Gugliotta is back starting.
                           Bad news is he's averaging 5.0 points
14    UTAH  (1-2)          There you go again: Mailman says it'd be
                           neat playing near home in New Orleans
15    HOUSTON  (2-1)       Owner says Yao story bigger than Jackie

17    ORLANDO  (3-1)       Huh? Riley says McGrady, Hill better as
                           tandem than Magic and Worthy
18    MILWAUKEE  (0-2)     Must be Forgotten Bruin Week in NBA:
                           Second-round pick Gadzuric starting
19    ATLANTA  (2-1)       Big Dog, now Big Hawk, scores 64 in his
                           first two, with 15 rebounds, 15 assists
20    CHICAGO  (2-1)       The last time they ranked this high,
                           Clinton was president, MJ was a Bull
21    LAKERS  (1-2)        Shaq's back soon. Of course, by then they
                           could be five games behind Kings
22    BOSTON (1-2)         Not start Celtics hoped for: Blow 13-point
                           lead over Bulls, lose to Wizards by 45
23    CLEVELAND  (1-2)     Sound (for moment) Tyrone Hill, Ilgauskas
                           make Cavaliers semi-legit
24    CLIPPERS  (0-2)      Oh, oh: Needed a way better start than
                           this to get their minds off $$$
25    MIAMI (0-2)          Riley, asked how he measures rebuilding
                           teams: "I don't know. Never had one."
26    MEMPHIS  (0-3)       West gives Lowe a chance, but giving up
                           119, 109, 116 doesn't look good
27    GOLDEN STATE (1-2)   Oops: Dunleavy, third pick in draft,
                           stunned to get one minute in opener
28    NEW YORK (0-3)       Before Knicks even open, Chaney, Layden
                           get vote of confidence/kiss of death
29    DENVER  (1-2)        Can't afford many more wins like

<DL></DL>
<LD>**** Makings of a classic</LD>
<LD>   *** Smash-mouth football</LD>
<LD>   ** Good for an end around</LD>
<TE>   * Strictly fantasy fodder</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ** Baltimore (3-4) at Atlanta (4-3), 10 a.m.: Michael Vick has
become such a dangerous weapon at quarterback, even Ray Lewis
probably isn't that broken up over the shoulder injury that will keep
him sidelined. LINE: Atlanta by 7 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   *** New England (3-4) at Buffalo (5-3), 10 a.m., KNX (1070):
Former Patriot quarterback Drew Bledsoe is next on the agenda for
struggling New England. Can't imagine many in the Northeast will want
to read the minutes after this meeting. LINE: Buffalo by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Philadelphia (5-2) at Chicago (2-5), 10 a.m., Channel 11: When
Bears had best defense last season, Donovan McNabb led Eagles to 33
points, 299 yards passing and a playoff victory. These days, Chicago
defense is weak and McNabb is better than ever. LINE: Philadelphia by
6 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   *** Pittsburgh (4-3) at Cleveland (4-4), 10 a.m.: Browns still
kicking themselves over Week 3 loss to Steelers, but Cleveland
linebacker/philosopher Kenard Lang refuses to lament the defeat: "If
ifs and buts were candy and nuts, every day would be Christmas."
LINE: Pittsburgh by 3.</TE>
<TE>   * Dallas (3-5) at Detroit (2-5), 10 a.m.: Just think: If Barry
Sanders hadn't retired three years ago, this might be a matchup of
the Nos. 1 and 2 all-time leading rushers with Emmitt Smith playing
second fiddle. LINE: Detroit by 3.</TE>
<TE>   *** Cincinnati (0-7) at Houston (2-5), 10 a.m.: In light of Bengal
Coach Dick LeBeau's victory guarantee and the fact that the
oddsmakers actually favor the Texans, Houston Coach Dom Capers points
to sign above locker room door: "Deeds, not words." LINE: Houston by
3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Tennessee (3-4) at Indianapolis (4-3), 10 a.m.: The bad news
for the Colts: Eddie George has consecutive 100-yard rushing efforts.
Worse news for the Colts: Four of their eight players listed as
questionable or doubtful this week are defensive linemen. LINE:
Indianapolis by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Minnesota (2-5) at Tampa Bay (6-2), 10 a.m.: By changing hotels
and imposing an earlier curfew, Viking Coach Mike Tice is doing
everything he can to minimize distractions. What he forgets is that
he has a bad team. LINE: Tampa Bay by 7.</TE>
<TE>   *** New York Jets (2-5) at San Diego (6-1), 1 p.m., Channel 2: Of
the Chargers' bye week, Marcellus Wiley said: "A lot of guys ... ate
a lot of good food and came back fat." In next breath he says, "A lot
of guys are thirsty for another game." Thank goodness they aren't
hungry. LINE: San Diego by 7 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** St. Louis (2-5) at Arizona (4-3), 1:15 p.m., KLAC (570),
KLSX-FM (97.1): Cardinal defense gives up only 3.5 yards per rush.
Marshall Faulk has rushed for 393 yards in 60 carries (6.6 yards per
carry) in the last two games. Something has to give. LINE: St. Louis
by 3.</TE>
<TE>   **** San Francisco (5-2) at Oakland (4-3), 1:15 p.m., Channel 11,
KMPC (1540), KNX (1070): In this Bay Area battle between the
wine-and-cheese 49er fans and blue-collar Raider backers, wouldn't
Barry Bonds be perfect to throw out the ceremonial sour grape? LINE:
Oakland by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Washington (3-4) at Seattle (2-5), 1:15 p.m.: Quarterbacks will
be the story one way or another. Matt Hasselbeck is back in the fold
for Seahawks after injury to Trent Dilfer as Jeff George waits in
wings. As for Redskins, Shane Matthews drew the short straw this
week. LINE: Seattle by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Jacksonville (3-4) at New York Giants (3-4), 5:30 p.m., ESPN,
KLSX-FM (97.1): Boy, think about all that's at stake in this one: The
winner can still convince itself for another week that it actually
has a chance to make a difference in the postseason. Wow. LINE: New
York by 3.</TE>
<TE>   **** Miami (5-2) at Green Bay (6-1), Monday, 6 p.m., Channel 7,
KNX (1070): Will Brett Favre play? In his career, the Packer
quarterback has been knocked out of a game three times and the next
week he returned. His numbers in those games? 719 yards passing,
eight touchdowns and a 3-0 record. LINE: Green Bay by 4.</TE>
<TE>   Open date: Carolina, Denver, Kansas City, New Orleans.</TE>

<LD>Beat New York?</LD>
<LD>   We did that just the other day, Angels over Yankees in the
American League playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Beat New Jersey?</LD>
<TE>   We did that too, Lakers over Nets in the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Never knowing when to quit, New York and New Jersey have joined
forces in an effort to land a future Super Bowl, competing against
Los Angeles for the same prize.</TE>
<TE>   New York would get Super Bowl Week -- the six days and nights
before the game -- for obvious reasons.</TE>
<TE>   (Although the "Exotic Erotic Commissioners Party" in North Jersey
would be unprecedented in pro football.)</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey would get the game, in Giants Stadium. Considering the
current state of the Jets and Giants, league officials are confident
any such Super Bowl would be played at a neutral site.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles counters with the Rose Bowl, hallowed home of the
Granddaddy of Them All, give or take the odd Miami-Nebraska clunker,
as well as five previous Super Bowls, although none since 1993. We're
overdue.</TE>
<TE>   NFL owners will meet again in May to dole out the 2007, 2008 and
2009 Super Bowls. That gives them ample time to consider both bids.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles: A Super Bowl would enable the league to get back into
the nation's second-largest market.</TE>
<TE>   New York/New Jersey: In late January, when Super Bowls are
traditionally played, it is very, very cold.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles: A Super Bowl would be seen as a goodwill gesture to a
city abandoned by the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   New York/New Jersey: The average temperature in New York during
January is about 33 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles: A Super Bowl could trigger the kind of Rose Bowl
renovations needed to lure an existing NFL team to relocate in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   New York/New Jersey: The average high in New Jersey during January
is 38 degrees; the average low is 24.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles: After San Diego in 2003, the next three Super Bowls
will be played in Houston, Jacksonville and Detroit. After that run,
the league won't want to take a winter vacation in Hollywood -- it
will need one.</TE>
<TE>   New York/New Jersey: The coldest temperature ever recorded in the
state of New Jersey is minus-34 degrees in River Vale, Jan. 5, 1904.
River Vale is about 17 miles from Giants Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles: Tourists in town for the Super Bowl will be able to
enjoy leisurely rounds of golf, outdoor tennis and patio dining at
the area's many outstanding restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   New York/New Jersey: Jan. 19-20, 1978, a blizzard dumped 13.6
inches of snow on New York.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles: A crowd of 103,985 -- the biggest in Super Bowl
history -- watched the Pittsburgh Steelers rally to defeat the Los
Angeles Rams, 31-19, at the Rose Bowl on Jan. 20, 1980.</TE>
<TE>   New York/New Jersey: On Jan. 25, 1821, the Hudson River froze,
allowing thousands to cross the ice from New York to New Jersey. On
Super Bowl Sunday, this could help expedite traffic flow around
Giants Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles: The Dallas Cowboys came within three points of the
Super Bowl record when they defeated the Buffalo Bills, 52-17, at the
Rose Bowl on Jan. 31, 1993.</TE>
<TE>   New York/New Jersey: On Jan. 25, 1780, it was 16-below in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles: January 2007 would mark the 40th anniversary of the
first Super Bowl, which was played in Los Angeles, at the Coliseum,
with the Green Bay Packers defeating the Kansas City Chiefs, 35-10.</TE>
<TE>   New York/New Jersey: Remember the "Sopranos" episode where Paulie
and Christopher get lost in the woods, they're up to their shins in
snow, Paulie loses a shoe, the sun sets, they think they're going to
freeze to death and they wind up huddled in a plumber's abandoned
van, shivering and sucking on packets of fast-food relish for
sustenance? That's New Jersey in January.</TE>
<TE>   NFL owners, the choice is yours.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the Source</TE>
<TE>   At last week's NFL owners' meetings in New York, several owners
addressed the prospect of a New York/New Jersey Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo's Ralph Wilson, being from Buffalo, isn't keen on the
idea, telling reporters he believes "the Super Bowl should be played
under championship conditions. I feel uneasy about having the game
played where there may be a chance of bad weather."</TE>
<TE>   However, New England's Bob Kraft thinks football in the snow is
great fun, noting how exciting last year's Oakland-at-New England
playoff game was.</TE>
<TE>   Kraft's Patriots won that game, due in large part to the freezing
temperature and inclement conditions. Who would you rather have
kicking a field goal in the snow with a trip to the conference final
on the line, Adam Vinatieri or Sebastian Janikowski?</TE>
<TE>   Raider owner Al Davis has used many adjectives to describe that
game. "Exciting" isn't one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Going for 6-0</TE>
<TE>   Drew Bledsoe, who passed for 29,657 yards in nine seasons with the
Patriots, plays against his former team for the first time today when
Buffalo plays New England at home.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe is about to join a select list of NFL quarterbacks who
have passed for 25,000 yards with one team and then got the chance to
oppose that team in a regular-season game. Only five others have done
it -- and here is how they fared in their first games against their
former team:</TE>
<TE>   John Hadl, playing for Green Bay against San Diego in 1974: Green
Bay 34, San Diego 0.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Krieg, playing for Kansas City against Seattle in 1992:
Kansas City 26, Seattle 7.</TE>
<TE>   Boomer Esiason, playing for the New York Jets against Cincinnati
in 1993: New York 17, Cincinnati 12.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Montana, playing for Kansas City against San Francisco in
1994: Kansas City 24, San Francisco 17.</TE>
<TE>   Warren Moon, playing for Minnesota against Houston in 1995:
Minnesota 23, Houston 17, in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Scoreboard: Quarterbacks 5, Former Teams 0 ... with Bledsoe
favored to make it 6-0 today.</TE>
