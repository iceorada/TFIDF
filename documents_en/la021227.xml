<HD>Israeli music warms up to controversy</HD>
<DH>As mainstream artists shy away from overt stands, hip-hop
acts have taken risks with political issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gwen Ackerman</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>"The land absorbs our blood and tears," raps a local hip-hop star,
but the person "has yet to be born who can stop the state of Israel."</LD>
<LD>   Hip-hop, rooted in the urban ghettos of the United States, has
become the voice of defiant Israeli youngsters whose social life has
been jolted by suicide bombings in cafes, pubs and discos during a
Palestinian uprising.</LD>
<LD>   "Hip-hop used to be too out there, too extreme, too nonconformist
for the Israeli public," said Gad Gidor, artist and repertoire
manager at Israel's Helicon Records. "Nowadays, it is like the rock
'n' roll of Israel because [hip-hop performers] dare to speak about
things commercial artists don't."</LD>
<TE>   Take Subliminal and the Shadow, whose black album cover shows a
muddy hand clutching a Star of David, a symbol of the Jewish state.
"United we stand, divided we fall" is the theme of the popular album.</TE>
<TE>   More mainstream Israeli singers do not ignore the more than
2-year-old uprising but prefer to raise issues in a less
confrontational style.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not using it to raise the flag. Established artists are
afraid of doing that because the country is too divided and they are
bound to lose some audience if they are too clear about their
opinions," Gidor said.</TE>
<TE>   Shalom Hanoch, a rocker in his 50s, recently left an exit sign
lighted on stage for an entire concert, pointing to it and noting:
"That is what we should do, but this is not a political concert."
Hanoch was referring to an Israeli withdrawal from land it occupied
in the 1967 Mideast war.</TE>
<TE>   Young hip-hop artists, however, can be more vocal than musicians
like Hanoch because they have little to lose and can establish a
following by sounding a political note.</TE>
<TE>   Subliminal and the Shadow strike right-wing themes in their music.
Their album incorporates a folksong from Hanukkah, the Jewish
festival of lights, celebrating the victory of the biblical Maccabee
rebels over the Greek Syrian Seleucid empire.</TE>
<TE>   "We have come to banish the darkness," the song goes.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the political spectrum, rapper Mook E slams
Israel's occupation of land that Palestinians want for a state in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. "Everyone is talking about peace but no one
is talking about justice," note the lyrics of one Mook E song.</TE>
<TE>   Although hip-hop is popular among the youth, older Israelis are
looking for more escapism in their music, said Izhar Ashdot, a
recording artist and producer. Pop songs written 10 to 20 years ago
are seeing a comeback, which Ashdot attributes to a hunger for "a
period in memory that seems better than today."</TE>
<TE>   Riding this wave of nostalgia is "Our Path Is Not Easy," a cover
of an old love ballad released last year. It has become an unofficial
anthem.</TE>
<TE>   "The song was adopted to the national situation. With all the
[Palestinian] attacks, it came at the right place at the right time,
when there is not a lot of new music being written," said Yossi
Cahana, an Israel Radio music editor.</TE>

<LD>Shania Twain's "Up!" is No. 1 on the nation's album sales chart for
the fifth consecutive week, as the country singer and other recording
artists enjoyed a merry surge in holiday sales.</LD>
<LD>   "Up!" sold 456,000 copies in the week that ended Sunday, up from
373,000 copies the previous week, and similar bumps were seen all
through the chart. All the albums down to No. 42, for instance, sold
100,000 or more copies, when just a month ago there were titles in
the Top 10 that fell shy of that threshold.</LD>
<LD>   After Twain, the Top 5 was rounded out by the "8 Mile" soundtrack,
the Dixie Chicks, Avril Lavigne and Jennifer Lopez, respectively.</LD>
<TE>   Only a handful of albums debuted on the chart, since labels
release few records the week before Christmas, when they can get lost
in the holiday swirl. The most notable was Lil' Romeo's "Game Time"
at No. 33.</TE>

<HD>Does Hollywood heed critics?</HD>
<DH>The number of awards dilutes their effect, but some do call
attention to movies the Oscars might otherwise ignore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Anderson</AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The New York Film Critics Circle Awards are generally tarted up and
strutted out (by the group's own publicists!) as being precursors to
the Oscars, which is something either group could protest as a gross
slur upon its character.</LD>
<LD>   The East Coast group would not, for instance, ever select as
artistically dubious a filmmaker as Ron Howard as best director (as
the Oscars did last year). The West Coast-based Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences would be loath to select a commercially
modest masterpiece like "Far From Heaven" as its best picture (as the
circle did Dec. 16).</LD>
<LD>   Seldom the twain shall meet. In fact, you have to go back to 1993
to find the two outfits agreeing on a year's best film -- in that
case, "Schindler's List." In 1991, the groups also saw eye-to-eye on
"The Silence of the Lambs."</LD>
<TE>   No, the importance to the Oscar race of the New York group (to
which all three Newsday critics belong, along with 30-odd others --
and I mean odd) is that it puts people and movies in contention. That
the choices might have any value as a judge of film quality is of
distant, secondary importance to the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, however, talent reaps the benefits. Diane Lane,
selected as best actress in New York for her rather splendid work in
the unsplendid "Unfaithful," now seems to have an academy nomination
in her pocket. "Far From Heaven," the Todd Haynes hommage  to Douglas
Sirk, now has Oscar legs: With New York awards for director, best
supporting actor (Dennis Quaid), best supporting actress (Patricia
Clarkson) and cinematography (by Ed Lachmann), it would seem a likely
beneficiary of academy members' fear of being thought of as
philistines.</TE>
<TE>   The thing is, there are so many critics' awards that their effect
gets diluted. If you're a movie company with a movie you'd like to
have win awards, there is usually a group that will accommodate you.
The esteemed Los Angeles Film Critics Assn. recently gave the
wonderful "About Schmidt" its big prize. New York Film Critics
Online, a group that seems open to anyone who can access a Web site,
picked "Chicago." The National Board of Review selected "The Hours."
The International Documentary Assn. picked "Bowling for Columbine,"
not just as the year's best documentary but as the best ever. That's
right, ever.</TE>
<TE>   Someone used to say to me, "If you can't say anything nice, don't
say anything at all," a piece of advice that obviously went in one
ear and out the other.</TE>
<TE>   That would mean the end of meaningful criticism as we know it.
Sometimes saying something nice -- even if you do it in what
scholarscall implied speech, as in the bestowing of an award -- is
the most effective, constructive thing a critic can do. No one's
writing is going to stop anyone from seeing "Maid in Manhattan," if
the viewer is really so sadly inclined. But last year there would
have been no future or even, perhaps, a release for "In the Bedroom,"
and the Oscar nomination for Sissy Spacek, without massive critical
support for Todd Fields' movie.</TE>
<TE>   This year, how many people would have seen the exquisite "Spirited
Away" if it hadn't received so many four-star reviews? "Russian Ark,"
one of this or any other year's great films, will have a life (even
if the New York circle overlooked it) because of critics.</TE>
<TE>   This has been a good year, all in all. Yes, there were lumbering,
bloated spectacles ("Four Feathers"), painful embarrassments ("The
Banger Sisters") and unspeakable nightmares ("Swept Away"). On the
other hand, there was a resurgence in auteurish films such as "Far
From Heaven," "Adaptation," "Solaris" and "Talk to Her." I I think
the support system has reasons to be happy.</TE>

<LD>By the Sword</LD>
<LD>   A History of Gladiators, Musketeers, Samurai, Swashbucklers, and
Olympic Champions</LD>
<LD>   Richard Cohen</LD>
<TE>   Random House: 520 pages, $29.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Richard Cohen writes of fencing that "of all sports arguably the
most romantic, it also most closely simulates the act of armed
manslaughter." A five-time national saber champion in Britain and
member of the British team in four Olympics, Cohen hangs on this
observation an exhaustive book on the history of swords and
swordsmanship.</TE>
<TE>   Fencers and other sword fanciers will be engrossed by the details
of "By the Sword: A History of Gladiators, Musketeers, Samurai,
Swashbucklers, and Olympic Champions." Others will discover in it a
more ambiguous picture of life, in which death and the ways to
inflict it become entwined with personal honor, technological
improvements and, yes, elegance and beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Much as Patrick O'Brian, in his novels about the royal navy in the
Napoleonic Wars, revived the seafaring past of the English tongue,
Cohen reminds us that it is easy to find vestiges of swordsmanship in
modern society and that it is common in all modern languages to find
metaphors and aphorisms for thrusting, cutting and slashing.</TE>
<TE>   "We shake hands," he writes, "to show that we are not reaching for
our swords; a gentleman offers a lady his right arm because at one
time his sword was at his left hip; a man's coat buttons left over
right, so that a duelist might unbutton it with his left, unarmed
hand. The two main parties in the House of Commons are separated by
the precise length of two sword blades; and each MP's locker still
contains a loop of silk on which to hang up his sword. Kamikaze
pilots took their samurai swords with them into their cockpits."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen surveys the history of metallurgy and swords around the
world. He quotes R. Ewart Oakeshott, an authority on early arms, as
believing that swords first appeared between 1500 and 1100 BC in
Minoan Crete and Celtic Britain. The earliest known depiction of
fencing is in a temple built around 1190 BC near Luxor in upper Egypt
by Ramses III. The Chinese, Japanese, Persians, Babylonians and
Romans sometimes fenced as a pastime, but fencing was mostly used by
soldiers in combat. Ancient Hindu legend recounts that the god Brahma
taught his priest-warriors martial exercise with the sword.</TE>
<TE>   By the European Middle Ages, the sword had become the symbol of
dominion and kingship. And even as the longbow and then gunpowder
pushed the sword from center stage in combat, it took on in Europe a
new aura of personal skill and manliness. Here began the romance, if
that is what it truly is, of fencing and swordsmanship that persists
to this day. And began too the custom -- or rather the fashion -- of
dueling.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen is good on how dueling came about, but short on the why. It
seems to have been an expression of individuality as, in the 18th and
19th centuries, societies moved from emphasis on hierarchy to that of
the individual (and the exquisite as well as, perhaps, absurd
cultivation of personal points of honor). Dueling was intimately
related to the Romantic movement in art, music and sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   In cinema, fencing had become fun and games. Cohen has a lively
section on fencing in films. He writes that Alexandre Dumas, author
of "The Three Musketeers," "did more to popularize swordfighting than
anyone in history -- because so many people read him and because he
created the archetypes who would reign again in cinema."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood had its fencing masters too. Cohen thinks the best
fencing actors were Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Errol Flynn, because
they did it themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen quotes from a letter to him from Nicolo Perno, who coached
both the Italian and German national teams in the fascist years: "The
fencing strip has always seemed to me a metaphor for life itself: he
who knows how to move on it, how to overcome a rival by honest means,
has really discovered how life itself must be." Many fencers have
said similar things of the sport, and readers of "By the Sword" are
entitled to wonder which element, romance or combat, outweighs the
other.</TE>

<HD>An indelible impression rich with humor and dignity</HD>
<DH>Despite his death 25 years ago this week, Charlie Chaplin
endures as an icon, in part because of his characters' humanity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jay Boyar</AU>
<BD>Orlando Sentinel</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Close your eyes and he appears before you: Slight frame. Bowler hat.
Short-but-thick mustache. Big, floppy shoes. Shabby, ill-fitting
coat. Baggy pants. Tricky cane. Surprisingly delicate smile.</LD>
<LD>   Charlie Chaplin passed away this week in 1977 -- 25 Christmases
ago. But his name lives on and so does his image as "the Little
Tramp" of the silent-film era. Again shut your eyes and he starts to
walk -- that odd little waddle -- and soon he has slipped or stumbled
or tripped. But then in an instant, with that always-amazing grace,
he's managed to right himself.</LD>
<LD>   "He's one of those larger-than-life icons," says Matthew Curtis,
programming director for Enzian Theater in Maitland, Fla. "He's just
entered the fabric of culture."</LD>
<TE>   Considered to be the movies' first superstar, Charles Spencer
Chaplin was born in London to parents who were music-hall
entertainers. When he was 5, his father died and his mother suffered
a nervous breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, little Charlie was living a Dickensian life on the streets
and in charity homes. Eventually, he hooked up with a children's
musical troupe and when Chaplin was still in his early 20s,
sharp-eyed Keystone Kops producer Mack Sennett signed him up. In
1914, in "Kid Auto Races at Venice," Chaplin introduced the Little
Tramp character and there was no stopping him.</TE>
<TE>   It's sad but fitting that the great silent clown died, at age 88,
on Christmas Day. The yuletides of his impoverished youth were
especially difficult days when even the gift of a single orange could
not be counted on.</TE>
<TE>   Long after Chaplin had become a world-famous success, the holiday
season remained a sore point. So his family would try to cheer him up
by showing one of his comedies. One Christmas he insisted on seeing
"The Kid," the film in which his character attempts to raise a street
urchin, whom the authorities want to take from him. The thought of a
poor child suddenly torn from a parental figure hit too close to
home.</TE>
<TE>   "We put 'The Kid' on and he cried," daughter Jane Chaplin once
recalled. "It was a very emotional Christmas afternoon."</TE>
<TE>   Many people today may never have seen an entire Chaplin classic
such as "The Kid" or "City Lights" or "Modern Times" or "The Gold
Rush." So how does the Chaplin legend live on?</TE>
<TE>   To a large extent, he continues to exist through the many
imitations of his image in popular culture. A Chaplin character
played by Eddie Izzard appeared this year in the murder mystery "The
Cat's Meow," and Robert Downey Jr. played him in the 1992 biopic
"Chaplin."</TE>
<TE>   In September, the Toronto International Film Festival featured
silent Chaplin shorts with music performed by the Toronto Symphony
Orchestra. "I've enjoyed listening to you," composer-conductor Carl
Davis told the audibly appreciative crowd. According to Steve
Gravestock, the Toronto festival's programming manager, an impressive
number of children showed up for the program, even though it wasn't
specifically marketed to kids, and had a great time.</TE>
<TE>   Chaplin understood how to create a character that people could
take to heart. "You know, the little man struggling to overcome, in
love and work and everything," says Curtis. "I just think people can
identify with what he did."</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody felt like they were his friend," says Pat Hanson, a
film historian for the American Film Institute. "He was like, 'our
Charlie.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Little Tramp might be shabbily dressed, but there is a certain
dignity to the way he comports himself -- a dignity, says Gravestock,
that "is always being affronted."</TE>
<TE>   "Of all comedians," critic James Agee once observed, Chaplin had
the shrewdest and most sensitive understanding "of what a human being
is, and is up against."</TE>
<TE>   Another key to Chaplin's appeal may be the mixed emotions he
inspires. "He could evoke both comedy and sadness at the same time
and really hit all the right buttons for the audience," says Hanson.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Gold Rush" -- "the picture I want to be remembered by," as
Chaplin called it -- there's a famous holiday dinner scene in which
his starving character is reduced to boiling an old shoe and eating
it. The shoe is still steaming as he sets it on a platter and removes
the laces with his knife and fork. Then he carefully separates the
upper part of the shoe from the sole, which he then chews pensively,
as if considering the merits of its texture and flavor.</TE>
<TE>   There are moments during that sequence when his hungry eyes tell a
desperate story. But his fastidiousness throughout the entire process
-- the dainty way he twirls the laces on his fork, as if they were
spaghetti strands -- is hilarious.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like: I'm going to starve with dignity," Hanson says. "We
may feel sorry for him, but he doesn't really seem to feel sorry for
himself."</TE>

<HD>Angels score a new home with KDIS-KSPN switch</HD>

<LD>This past season, the Anaheim Angels ended up in a place they'd never
been, among the company of major league baseball's world champions.
Next season, their fans will find them in a more familiar spot: back
at 710 on the AM radio dial.</LD>
<LD>   The move is part of a reshuffling that takes effect Wednesday when
the Southland affiliates of Radio Disney and ESPN -- KDIS-AM (710)
and KSPN-AM (1110) -- switch frequencies. Fans of sports talk and
live game coverage will have to spin a bit farther to the left to
hear the likes of Dan Patrick and his colleagues, while the kids and
parents who are the target audience of Disney's family-friendly pop
will have to ratchet up their dials a few more kilohertz.</LD>
<LD>   The move is a homecoming for the Angels, who had 710 AM as their
flagship station for 36 years, when its call letters were KMPC. In a
way, the team owes its existence to the station.</LD>
<TE>   Cowboy crooner Gene Autry owned a string of radio stations,
including KMPC. In 1961, after the Los Angeles Dodgers left KMPC for
a rival station, Autry went to the baseball owners' winter meeting
hoping to replace them by securing the broadcast rights for one of
the upcoming season's two new expansion teams. When a prospective
team owner dropped out, Autry stepped in and came home with the
Angels as well as programming for his station.</TE>
<TE>   KMPC was the Angels' home until 1997, when Disney bought both. It
moved the Angels to KLAC-AM (570) and turned KMPC into KDIS, Radio
Disney. Disney/ABC, which also owns ESPN, turned the former KRLA-AM
(1110) into an ESPN Radio affiliate in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are leaving KLAC, which also carries the Lakers and had
bumped the Angels several times when game times conflicted. In
addition, the ESPN-Disney station switch places the team on the
outlet with the stronger signal of the two.</TE>
<TE>   The station locked up the Angels for five years on their heritage
frequency, said ESPN Radio spokeswoman Linda Bernson.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Disney/ABC officials are confident that Radio Disney
fans will find their station at its new location. "KDIS has no direct
format competitors," Bernson said. "There was no concern they would
get lost on the dial."</TE>
<TE>   And though baseball season is still far off, the new ESPN radio
will launch with much fanfare Wednesday, carrying a full slate of New
Year's Day college football bowl games, including the Rose Bowl at
1:30 p.m. The station will also air the Fiesta Bowl at 4:30 p.m. Jan.
3, with the Miami Hurricanes and Ohio State Buckeyes meeting for the
national championship.</TE>
<TE>   The ESPN switch is just one change that sports radio fans will
have to reckon with in the new year. Clear Channel Communications is
merging its all-sports stations in L.A. and San Diego, KXTA-AM (1150)
and XTRA-AM (690), respectively. The company is consolidating staff
and will simulcast programming.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to create the biggest sports station in Southern
California," said Robin Bertolucci, director of AM programming for
Clear Channel-Los Angeles. "Our signals are both in the same area,
and instead of fighting for the same audience, we decided to make one
superstation."</TE>
<TE>   The merger had been scheduled for mid-December but was pushed back
to Jan. 6.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Art Bell will be saying farewell</TE>
<TE>   Art Bell, whose overnight radio program "Coast to Coast AM"
explores unexplained phenomena ranging from UFOs to Bigfoot, will
relinquish the show following his New Year's Eve broadcast next week.</TE>
<TE>   It's not paranormal forces, nor agents of the shadow government
controlling the country that are forcing him off the air, but
something far more mundane: a chronic bad back that makes it
unbearable for him to sit in a chair for several hours a night
broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   His replacement, George Noory, is a kindred spirit and a familiar
voice to "Coast to Coast" listeners. Noory began filling in for Bell
two years ago and became his regular guest host when Bell's back
trouble meant he missed more and more shows.</TE>
<TE>   When he announced his plans to leave in October, Bell said, "It's
not fair to listeners for me to be gone so much." Noory was already
host of the show three nights a week, with Barbara Simpson the host
on Sunday nights.</TE>
<TE>   "Noory's ratings for when he's filled in have kept pace with Art's
ratings," said Keven Bellows, spokeswoman for Premiere Radio, which
distributes "Coast to Coast." She said officials there hope Bell's
audience will remain with the new host.</TE>
<TE>   Bell started the show in 1993 and broadcasts to more than 500
stations from his home studio outside Las Vegas. Locally he's heard
from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. weeknights on KFI-AM (640).</TE>
<TE>   His final regular show will be his annual New Year's Eve
prediction program, with visions for 2003 and a review of what was
expected for 2002. He will return periodically to fill in for Noory.</TE>
<TE>   Noory comes from KTRS in St. Louis, where his show "The Nighthawk"
has aired since 1997, examining many of the same unusual topics
covered on "Coast to Coast."</TE>
<TE>   Though much of his 30-year broadcasting career included stints as
a television news producer and director, the two shows hark back to
his teenage fascination with unidentified flying objects.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Coast to Coast AM' may just be the most unusual show I have
ever witnessed or been a part of," Noory said in a statement. "You
really almost have to be born into that arena, I think, to handle it.
I was very lucky in that's the way I was guiding my own career. It
was this thirst to really get to the bottom of some of these stories
that kept pushing me."</TE>
<TE>   The retirement is actually Bell's third. He left in 1998 because
of what he called a "threatening, terrible event" that happened to
his family, according to his cryptic farewell message. It turned out
his son had been kidnapped and assaulted by a substitute teacher, and
Bell left to deal with the event and the ensuing trial. Bell
returned, only to quit again in 2000 after he was falsely accused of
child molestation. He returned in February 2001.</TE>

<HD>Vermont's old theater curtains tell their tales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SUDBURY, Vt.</DL>
<LD>Armed with a steam iron, an old sewing machine and a large crew of
staff and volunteers, Christine Hadsel is bringing the life back to
rolled-up theater curtains that have been gathering dust for almost a
century in town halls and local theaters all over Vermont.</LD>
<LD>   The Burlington resident set out four years ago to inventory what
she expected to be a dozen or so of the painted canvas curtains that
were popular in the early 1900s.</LD>
<LD>   After writing to clerks and historians in every town and putting
notices in papers about the missing curtains, Hadsel started hearing
back about curtains that were stashed under unused stages; curtains
that hadn't been unrolled in anyone's memory and curtains that were
still being used for theatrical productions in the little towns where
they'd been doing duty for 100 years.</LD>
<TE>   Hadsel now knows of at least 125 curtains in 80 towns that have
survived into modern times, decades beyond the vaudeville era. Some
have been restored; others are torn or badly damaged by water.
Reports of newly discovered curtains come in all the time.</TE>
<TE>   "These curtains were an investment in community culture," she said
recently. "It makes me really curious about the kind of entertainment
that happened in a place like Sudbury."</TE>

<HD>Polanski's tragic 'Pianist' achieves greatness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Roman Polanski's "The Pianist," nothing is more absurd or surreal
than war.</LD>
<LD>   Based on a memoir by a Polish Jew who survived the Warsaw ghetto,
the composer and concert pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, the film opens
on Sept. 23, 1939. Germany had invaded Poland weeks earlier, but the
pianist had continued to give recitals on Warsaw Radio, stepping over
corpses and dead horses on his way to the broadcast studio. That
September afternoon, he played a Chopin nocturne as the Luftwaffe
rained bombs on the city; the noise was so deafening he could barely
hear himself play. Several days later, Warsaw fell and he saw his
first German soldiers. Not long afterward he read his first Nazi
proclamation targeted at Jews. "Their lives," read the decree, "would
be absolutely secure."</LD>
<TE>   Szpilman published his memoir in 1946. It was too soon after the
war for him to cushion his language with politesse and the book is at
once tough and tough going, shocking in its directness and its
chilled lack of sentimentalism. A memoir written by a man for whom
history is not dead and is yet littered with the dead, it is a book
that doesn't obviously lend itself to cinematic interpretation. It is
never easy to watch people suffer and die without even the glimmer of
hope, which makes it extraordinary that Polanski, another Polish Jew
who survived, has been able to bring Szpilman's detachment to the
screen. All the more so given that "The Pianist" achieves the
monumental without abandoning the modesty of its origins.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Poland surrenders, the 27-year-old Szpilman (Adrien
Brody), his two sisters, brother and parents make the calamitous
decision to stay in Warsaw. Clustered around the radio and hearing
that Britain and France have joined against Germany, they reason "all
will be well." All is not well, although it takes a while for the
Nazis' second war, the one against the Jews, to surface in its
violent extravagance, since it is a war initially waged with rules
and regulations and only spasms of terror. Jews are to wear a
precisely measured white armband branded with the Star of David on
their right arms. Jews are forbidden to enter Warsaw's parks, sit on
its benches or stroll along its sidewalks. They must use the gutter
or, as Szpilman's father (Frank Finlay) discovers, risk the wrath of
passing German soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Inch by inch, Jews are removed from the city's public life, then
literally removed from its streets, herded together in a ghetto.
Forced to abandon their apartment, the Szpilmans crowd into a few
rooms and, along with the nearly half a million other Jews crammed
into the ghetto's 1.3 square miles, they struggle for survival. As
the pianist plays in a cafe frequented by profiteers, again stepping
around corpses on his way to work, his younger brother, Henryk (Ed
Stoppard), sells the family's books in a market frantic with
desperation. On a good day, Henryk sells a copy of Dostoevsky's "The
Idiot." On a bad night, the family watches in mute horror as Nazis
dump an elderly neighbor out a fourth-floor window because the man,
confined to a wheelchair, has not stood to salute them.</TE>
<TE>   Life inside the ghetto was initially a mirror of life outside,
only more terrible. As the Szpilman family clings to the remnants of
their middle-class past, the rich laugh it up in exclusive cafes
while the poor drop dead in their tracks. As he does throughout the
film, Polanski refuses to linger over any of this. He doesn't want us
to get caught up in isolated incidents -- to get blindsided by the
harrowing image of a tiny child smuggler whom Szpilman tries to
rescue or the sight of a starving beggar licking gruel off the
pavement -- because he doesn't want us distracted by emotion. Our
tears, the director seems to be saying, shouldn't get in the way of
our understanding.</TE>
<TE>   The late critic Kenneth Tynan wrote that Polanski is "totally
armored against sentiment," and that serves the director brilliantly
in "The Pianist." This armature allows Polanski to focus on Szpilman
without losing sight of the larger devastation and, as important, it
gives the director the intellectual distance to point out not just
the tragedy of the Shoah but its inherent surrealism. "It's too
absurd," one of Szpilman's friends says plaintively, as she watches
Warsaw's Jews marched into the ghetto. "The Germans will never
squander such a huge labor force," says an old man quite reasonably,
waving away rumors of extermination hours before he's whisked off to
a camp. Never before has a fiction film so clearly and to such
devastating effect laid out the calculation of the Nazi machinery of
death and its irrationality.</TE>
<TE>   As the war grinds on and food becomes increasingly scarce,
Szpilman begins to shrink inside his suit. Brody's large eyes grow
positively enormous even as his performance remains delicate, muted.
The pianist tries to join the resistance, only to be rebuffed. "You
musicians," a partisan smiles, "don't make good conspirators." The
instinct for survival, Polanski reminds us repeatedly, puts a lie to
heroic fantasy. In this nightmarish world where corpses litter the
streets, the bodies of dead Jews serve as a continual threats and
reminders for the living. Through administrative measures and the
spectacle of terror the Nazis strip away resistance. Like everyone
else, the Szpilmans believe their survival hinges on their
cooperation. So they scramble for work permits that won't need and,
when the order for deportation comes, pack suitcases they can't
bring.</TE>
<TE>   There are, perhaps, a limited number of ways to narrate the
catastrophe of the Holocaust. One way is to present the overwhelming
evidence as Raul Hilberg does in "The Destruction of the European
Jews" and Claude Lanzmann does in his documentary "Shoah." Another
way is to filter some of that evidence through the experience of an
individual. Polanski, who escaped the Krakow ghetto when he was a
child, has spent his entire filmmaking career making movies that,
steeped in alienation and paranoia, carry traces of the Holocaust.
This time, faced with the historical event, he tempers his style, and
the alienation and paranoia creep in from the outside, unescorted and
relentless. With "The Pianist," Polanski's strange genius serves
Szpilman's remembrance and, in doing so, rescues his legacy from the
blunder of much of the director's recent work.</TE>
<TE>   We know that Szpilman survived. In his book and in Polanski's
telling, the musician's tortuous journey is neither triumphant nor
beautiful; it is, rather, a testament to the essential human desire
to live. In one of the more eccentric passages in "The Pianist,"
Szpilman simply watches the war unfold while peeping from behind a
window curtain. Every so often, a Polish man who's meant to regularly
supply him with provisions but rarely shows, drops by the apartment
with a few crumbs. "Still alive, then," he says, with a wild smile.
The pianist registers the comment and shoots the man a quick look in
which disbelief fights with disgust and hunger. Then the pianist does
what anyone would. He picks up some food and begins to eat.</TE>

<HD>Feeding the Kitty</HD>
<DH>The posh big girls are flocking to Henri Bendel to get
their fix of the cartoon feline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jill Gerston</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL>New York</DL>
<LD>New York</LD>
<LD>   Everywhere you look in a cluttered niche of the store you see
Hello Kitty, the winsome white cat with the button nose and blank
stare, peering up at you from T-shirts, notepads and even an electric
toothbrush.</LD>
<LD>   This must be the little girls' aisle in Zany Brainy or Toys R Us,
right?</LD>
<TE>   Wrong.</TE>
<TE>   This is the Lair boutique at Henri Bendel, the 5th Avenue
specialty store where Prada-clad big girls, if you can call size 2
twigs big girls, flock for their fix of Hello Kitty tchotchkes.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, the $90 retractable dog leashes and the $600 backpacks have
sold out, but a $175 tennis bag and $50 spa slippers are still
available to fashionistas who like to accessorize their wardrobes
with a wink and a grin.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so allergic to pretentiousness in fashion, and I think
everyone else is too," said Tiffany Dubin, the socialite and former
director of Sotheby's fashion department who last year founded Lair,
a chic little den that sells funky collectibles, vintage jewelry and
an exclusive "couture" range of Hello Kitty accessories, like a $40
belt with an enamel buckle of you-know-who. "Now, having a sense of
fun is where it's at, like wearing your Marc Jacobs coat with a
plastic Hello Kitty purse."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, to relieve the tedium of a dull dinner party, Dubin has
been known to flash the pink lights surrounding the face of her Hello
Kitty watch. The insouciant feline has come a long way since the
Tokyo-based Sanrio Co. introduced the character in 1974 (1976 in the
United States) as a cute adornment for notepads, coin purses and
other accessories for the pig-tailed set.</TE>
<TE>   She set off a craze in Japan, where little girls, their teenage
sisters and mothers amassed such treasures as Hello Kitty teacups,
skateboards, kimonos, lip gloss, cat food and, briefly, vibrators
(which were deemed inappropriate and pulled off the market).</TE>
<TE>   Although American fans aren't as obsessed -- we do not yet have
Hello Kitty cafes serving kitty-shaped waffles as they do in Hong
Kong and Tokyo -- many nevertheless remain loyal from kindergarten to
college to corporate suite. They still coo over Hello Kitty
accessories -- "cute! cute!" is the mantra of Kittyphiles -- and
display an inordinate fondness for pastel pink and blue, the cat's
preferred colors. Maybe it's nostalgia or a need to channel their
inner cutie-pie or just a passion for kitschy fashion. Whatever the
reason, legions of women, sporting $200 haircuts and La Perla
lingerie, have lost their hearts to Hello Kitty.</TE>
<TE>   "A trip to a Sanrio store by grown women is not an uncommon
thing," said Mariah O'Brien, a 30-year-old actress who lives in
Hollywood with her husband and daughter, Lucia, 5, and traces her
Hello Kitty roots back to fifth grade. "If I go to buy my daughter
something, it's impossible to get out of the store without buying
something for myself."</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien estimated that she owns about 30 Hello Kitty items,
including a CD player, a toaster (which imprints a kitty face on the
bread), clothes, nail polish and a brush coveted by her daughter.
Last year, O'Brien gave her best friend a Hello Kitty beaded evening
bag for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "Wearing Hello Kitty is like wearing a designer logo, but cooler,"
said O'Brien, who favors Miu Miu and Prada and tucks a Hello Kitty
address book into her Balenciaga bag. "It says the person is hip, fun
and doesn't take fashion too seriously. For sure, there is a cool
factor to Hello Kitty."</TE>
<TE>   Which may be why several in the red carpet brigade strut around
with all sorts of Hello Kitty paraphernalia. Mariah Carey totes a
boom box, Tyra Banks carries a sequined evening bag, Selma Blair
sports a hat and mittens, Drew Barrymore wears a watch and Gwen
Stefani uses a cell phone case. Christina Aguilera went so far as to
proclaim her passion for Hello Kitty gum to Jay Leno.</TE>
<TE>   Singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb is a collector too. "Hello Kitty
brings a sense of fun to the mundane things in life, like putting on
a scarf or making coffee," said Loeb, whose trove includes leg
warmers, a stereo, rice cooker, waffle maker, pajamas and a
microphone cover given to her by a Japanese fan. In tongue-in-cheek
homage, Loeb's latest CD is called "Hello Lisa," and the cover
features the singer wearing Hello Kitty's signature hair bow and the
cat wearing Loeb's trademark glasses.</TE>
<TE>   Why are so many women besotted?</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing is that Hello Kitty is really adorable and cute,
what the Japanese call kawaii, and that appeals to a lot of women on
a direct level," said fashion historian Valerie Steele, acting
director of the museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New
York. "Then, on another level, there is this ironic element of a
grown-up wearing a kid's cartoon character. You can use it to express
parts of your personality, including your inner child. A
businesswoman who takes out a Hello Kitty pen at a meeting shows she
is not just another corporate suit but an individual. Hello Kitty
represents the best part of fashion, the freedom part."</TE>
<TE>   Tarina Tarantino, 32, a jewelry and accessories designer who lives
in the Hollywood Hills and has a collection of more than 100 Hello
Kitty items, agreed. "A woman who wears Hello Kitty is not afraid of
what people think," said Tarantino, whose hair is hot pink and whose
taste in clothes runs to the "eclectic, colorful and funky."</TE>
<TE>   "You see these women carrying their Prada bags with a Hello Kitty
key chain hanging from them. I love that." The designer, whose
colorful crystal and Lucite jewelry has been worn by Claire Danes,
Cameron Diaz and Heather Graham, is currently negotiating with Sanrio
to do a collection of accessories and jewelry featuring a pink-haired
Hello Kitty.</TE>
<TE>   Every month, Sanrio unleashes a slew of new Hello Kitty
merchandise -- a pink microwave oven and a pink phone with angel
wings are holiday offerings -- which is sold in its stores from Des
Moines to Dubai. Production is limited and items are kept on the
shelves for a brief period, thus ensuring that Sanrio's star cat
becomes a hot collectible. (Two years ago, Kitty buffs in Singapore
rioted at McDonald's outlets when the chain ran out of little plastic
Hello Kittys clad in wedding gowns on the first day of a monthlong
promo.)</TE>
<TE>   The company, with annual revenue exceeding $1 billion, markets
children's products featuring dozens of other characters, including
Badtz Maru, a playful penguin; Pinki Lili, a teddy bear; Pochacco, a
frisky puppy, and My Melody, a little bunny. Although the other
characters share the shelves with Hello Kitty in various outlets,
including Target, FAO Schwarz and the Learning Express, none comes
close to matching the appeal of the superstar feline.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing the emotional attachment women have for Hello
Kitty," said Bill Hensley, the marketing director of Sanrio Inc., the
company's U.S. subsidiary. "Twenty-year-olds write to us and use
words like 'addiction,' which is pretty powerful. What they tell us
is that they find Hello Kitty irresistible because she's so cute."</TE>
<TE>   Don't snicker. At a time when the nightly news and morning
headlines bring a barrage of bad tidings, there is something
delightful about waking up to waffles shaped like a big kitten face.</TE>
<TE>   What can be the harm in a little whimsy, a lot of pink and an
adorable cat to coax a grin?</TE>
<TE>   "I once had a pair of Hello Kitty rain boots and whenever I wore
them on the subway, women would come rushing up to me and say,
'Wherever did you get those wonderful boots?' " recalled Steele.
"They made people happy just to look at them. Now, especially, people
are drawn to fashion that gives you a happy feeling. And Hello Kitty
makes you smile."</TE>

<HD>Cinematographer casts a long shadow</HD>
<DH>Janusz Kaminski creates the dark side of Steven Spielberg's
films.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Henderson</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are the oddest of couples: a sunny Hollywood storyteller with a
strong sentimental streak and his director of photography, a master
of shadows, beckoning him to the dark side.</LD>
<LD>   Director Steven Spielberg dwells on beauty, Janusz Kaminski,
Spielberg's director of photography, said in a recent interview.</LD>
<LD>   Kaminski, for his part, sees beauty in the bleak and the ugly.</LD>
<TE>   "He is very much interested in classical beauty," said Kaminski,
42, who first teamed up with Spielberg on "Schindler's List," which
won both men Oscars, for cinematography and directing, as well as
best picture honors.</TE>
<TE>   "I see beauty in bleakness," said Kaminski, who created the stark
and at times startling black-and-white palette of the Holocaust
drama.</TE>
<TE>   Working with Spielberg, whom he calls the "ultimate director,"
Kaminski has cast the shadows that permeate the Hollywood director's
last seven movies, including "Catch Me If You Can," a comedy that
opened on Christmas Day.</TE>
<TE>   The cameraman wants to present the audience with a "real" world,
and he says Spielberg understands.</TE>
<TE>   "He has just mellowed out so much," Kaminski said.</TE>
<TE>   Kaminski chose the strong lights that cast the dark shadows of
Spielberg's "Minority Report" and also did the lighting for "Saving
Private Ryan" and "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   "If it is required to go a little bit ugly, I'll go ugly,"
Kaminski says.</TE>
<TE>   Directors of photography are often said to "paint with light."
They design the look of films and collaborate with the directors on
shifting focus, jobs that requires technical skill and have
tremendous artistic effect.</TE>
<TE>   Kaminski describes "Catch Me If You Can" as "champagne," a bubbly
caper movie, although after his first viewing of the completed film,
he agreed there was a somber side to it.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI agent played by Tom Hanks tracks down a masterful con man
played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and the two develop an unlikely
friendship.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI agent and the check forger are both lonely figures on a
chase that takes them through a lush 1960s world that Kaminski calls
funky and quirky.</TE>
<TE>   But Kaminski also created the unflattering, bleached-out look of
the FBI office where Hanks' character works.</TE>
<TE>   "You get this naive character such as Tom Hanks' in this kind of
an ugly, ugly environment to emphasize his innocence, to emphasize
his naivete," Kaminski said. "I'm attracted to ugliness for the sake
of beauty."</TE>
<TE>   Kaminski grew up in Poland on a cultural diet of American music
and such films as "The Graduate" and the dark comedy "Harold and
Maude."</TE>
<TE>   However, he took up filmmaking as a profession at Columbia College
in Chicago only after immigrating to the United States when he was
21.</TE>
<TE>   He credits growing up in Eastern Europe, dominated by the Soviet
Union at the time, for tuning his artistic sensibility and interest
in the beauty of bleakness.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>You may recall that last year's post-yule column celebrated an
unknown work by Charles Dickens that was remarkably similar to his
great classic "A Christmas Carol."</LD>
<LD>   Now, amazingly, comes news of another discovery among the papers
of Dickens. This incandescent masterwork also features humbugging old
Ebenezer Scourge in a tale of redemption completed shortly before
Dickens' death, showing just how prophetic he was.</LD>
<LD>   Although competition for it was fierce, permission was granted to
publish it here first, in keeping with this column's high literary
tradition.</LD>
<TE>   The setting is again the wintry bleakness of Scourge's dusty
chambers, where he retires for the evening only to be awakened by
loud clanking. Cowering behind his covers, a terrified Scourge is
confronted by a ghost.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Who and what are you?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: The Ghost of TV Past.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: What do you want of me at this hour, ghost?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: I'm here to show you wreckage of a squandered medium known
as television.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Where are you taking me?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: To the TV set. Behold! Shows from the past!</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Why it's "Supermarket Sweep" and "The Partridge Family"
and "Manimal" and "My Mother the Car" and "Me and the Chimp." But who
are those other two figures?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Observe closely, Scourge.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Why it's Donny and Marie Osmond. They had their own show.
I'd almost forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   A second ghost: Look upon me, now, Scourge, for I am the Ghost of
TV Present.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: What do you want of me, spirit?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Behold the screen!</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Why it's a tiny tract house. Who lives there?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Do you not recognize the blissfully indigent Bob Cratchits?</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: My clerk, Bob, and his wife and children. They're in
front of a TV set watching....</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: "Fear Factor."</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: But who are those other people positioning lights,
cameras and cable in their house?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Observe closely, Scourge. Do you not recognize a TV crew?</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: The Cratchits invited a TV crew for a Christmas pudding?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: No, Scourge.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: What other explanation could there be, except.... You
don't mean.... Say it isn't so.... The Cratchits are....</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Yes, a reality show.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Like "The Osbournes"? With cameras witnessing their every
move?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Yes, Scourge. "The Cratchits" is the smash hit of the
season. A 40 share in the Nielsens.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Cratchit, shooting his wife a sly wink: You look especially
fetching in your little bonnet and ribbons, dear. While the kids are
watching TV, how about sneaking upstairs with me for a little you
know what?</TE>
<TE>   Floor director: Let's try it again, Bob, and this time grab your
crotch.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Oh, no!</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: There's something more, Scourge, something ominous,
something unknown to Bob and his wife as they ascend the stairs
toward ecstasy.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: More? Ominous? Unknown?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Inside the house is ...</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Tell me, spirit! Please, tell me!</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: A mole!</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: No, no, I can hardly bear it. But who would this
dastardly infiltrator be who would spy on the Cratchits so
insidiously and cruelly sabotage their lives and not be unmasked
until the last episode of the season for maximum ratings impact?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Observe closely, Scourge, and behold the angelic tyke
walking with crutches.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Oh, no, not him. Anyone but him. The mole is ...</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Tiny Tim.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Please, no more, spirit.</TE>
<TE>   A third ghost: Come with me, Scourge.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Who are you?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: The Ghost of TV Future.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: What are you showing me on those six TV monitors?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Behold ... newscasts!</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: But I don't understand, spirit. They all look and sound
alike.</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: They are alike, Scourge. Exact replicas.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: But how could that be?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Behold the noodleheads of the Federal Communications
Commission who loosened ownership regulations to the point that AOL
Time Warner, Viacom Inc., News Corp. and Walt Disney Co. were allowed
to merge into a single behemoth corporation in control of all radio
and television, one inevitably purchased by the single most powerful
person in media.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Tell me who, spirit. Don't make me wait.</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Behold, Scourge. Do you not recognize Oprah?</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Which is why she is anchoring the news on all six
monitors?</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Yes, Scourge, and why her boyfriend, Stedman Graham, is
doing weather and sports.</TE>
<TE>   Scourge: Will this nightmare never end, ghost? I beseech you to
show me no more.</TE>
<TE>   Ghost: Only if you promise to tune in next season, when the
Cratchits and the Osbournes face off in "Reality Show Boxing."</TE>

<KH>ALL THAT JAZZ</KH>
<HD>What to look for in the new year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's up in 2003 for jazz and world music? Quite a bit, most of it
favorable, but with some aspects inevitably reflecting the general
sense of uncertainty throughout the music business in the post-Sept.
11 world. Here's my list of 10 developments to watch in the two
genres as 2003 unfolds:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   The continuing saga of female jazz singers. This year, the ball
took at least one unexpected bounce in the female jazz vocalist
category. Norah Jones, initially surfacing as a nominal jazz singer,
largely due to her presence on the jazz-oriented Blue Note label,
turned out to be a multimillion-selling pop artist with a distinctly
country orientation. Will she return to her jazz roots in 2003? Don't
count on it. The sale of 3 million records makes a persuasive case to
keep on keeping on with what she did in "Come Away With Me."</LD>
<TE>   Among other jazz singers, Diana Krall (who started the recent rush
of new arrivals) will finally release a new album. And the same
question arises: Will she return to her fundamental jazz roots? In
her case, the answer may well be yes. Jane Monheit's 2003 release,
meanwhile, will have to persuade the jazz audience that she can make
a recording that swings as convincingly as her live performances.
Lizz Wright, meanwhile, a much-touted young artist waiting in the
wings, will finally have a CD proving, or disproving, the accuracy of
the advance buzz about her singing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Doing it themselves. Pop-folk singer Ani DiFranco's success with
her own go-it-alone record company is reverberating in the jazz world
with new labels run by saxophonist Branford Marsalis (Marsalis Music)
and George Duke (BigPiano Music). The initial releases feature the
two principals, and the real test will come when they must find a
balance between art and commerce in other performers they sign.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz artists have been issuing their own albums for years, mostly
as a matter of necessity. It remains to be seen whether the Marsalis
and Duke efforts are evidence of a new trend or simply another
approach to boutique recordings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the grooves -- uh, in the bytes, that is. Plenty of new jazz
releases will arrive in the first few months of 2003 (later dates are
still unannounced), among them CDs from Jason Moran, Dianne Reeves,
the Benny Green and Russell Malone duo, the super group Scolohofo
(John Scofield, Joe Lovano, Dave Holland and Al Foster), Manhattan
Transfer, Dave Brubeck and Freddy Cole.</TE>
<TE>   In other label developments, 2003 should see some interesting
results from the presence of veteran jazz producers Joel Dorn at
Hyena Records and Steve Backer at the reconstituted Savoy Records.</TE>
<TE>   Also worth noting, Concord Records celebrates its 30th anniversary
with a flow of new releases, including 30 albums mixed and mastered
in the new SACD format (which is compatible with current compact disc
players).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jazz at the Philharmonic. The L.A. Philharmonic's appointment of
singer Reeves as the creative chair for jazz opens up a potentially
large window for the music's exposure. With eight Hollywood Bowl
concerts and events at the new Walt Disney Concert Hall to program,
Reeves has the opportunity to bring an unprecedented amount of
authentic jazz to Southland audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Centennials galore -- with one big one. It's amazing how many
100th anniversaries of major jazz artists are occurring in 2003.
Pioneering violinist Joe Venuti, the great pianist and bandleader
Earl "Fatha" Hines, blues great Jimmy Rushing, alto saxophonist
Hilton Jefferson, bandleader-pianist Claude Hopkins.</TE>
<TE>   And -- the big one -- trumpeter Bix Beiderbecke, the model for the
shooting star, burn-out-early, stereotypical image of the jazzman,
but nonetheless one of the music's primary figures. Expect to see
numerous reissue collections.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Catalina finds a new spot. Jazz fans who have been daunted by the
current Cahuenga Boulevard location of Catalina Bar &amp; Grill will be
pleased to hear that Catalina Popescu, the club's founder and guiding
light, plans to reopen in a larger, Sunset Boulevard location at a
still undetermined date in 2003. Larger in size, with a patio and a
nearby parking structure, the new room should make Catalina an even
more engaging location to hear world-class jazz artists.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Year of the Blues. One of the more vital currents flowing into
jazz has always been the blues, so the designation of 2003 as the
Year of the Blues has significance for jazz as well. The media
centerpiece for the celebration is "The Blues," a series of seven
90-minute films produced by Martin Scorsese and scheduled for the
fall on PBS, embracing the history of the blues. But live
performances and events, many jazz-related, will take place
throughout the year. Best place for info: www.yearoftheblues.org.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who's arriving and who isn't? There have been continuing
cancellations of appearances by world music acts, especially those
from the Middle East, since Sept. 11. Will the trend continue in
2003? The answer is obviously directly tied to a potential war in
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Performances in the next few months that could be affected: KODO
(February), the Buena Vista Social Club (April), Youssou N'Dour (May)
and Ustad Vilayat Khan (May) at UCLA, Habib Koite and Bamada
(January) at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, and the Scots Guards Band
(March) at the Cerritos Center.</TE>
<TE>   But the greatest effect may well be upon the summer world music
series at the Hollywood Bowl. Stay tuned to the news and in touch
with box offices.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   World roots music. Before world music became a genre in itself,
listeners looking beyond pop, jazz and classical had to scour the
"ethnic music" bins to find sounds from other parts of the globe.
Until the Nonesuch Explorer series, that is, which released, from
1967 to 1984, an enormous collection of recordings made in the field
in every area of the globe. Nonesuch is now releasing this extremely
valuable, compelling collection of music on CDs in issues grouped by
global region. The first set of 13, released late in 2002, was
devoted to African music. The next set, scheduled for January, will
consist of 10 titles from Indonesia and the South Pacific -- each a
precious window into another culture.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A final thought. This column has long campaigned for a national
jazz artists support organization -- one that takes into account the
need for medical insurance, pension plans, financial advice, and
management and promotion support. It hasn't happened yet. But if it
comes together in 2003, that alone will make it a year to remember.</TE>

<HD>Meet young Adolf, budding art student</HD>
<DH>Menno Meyjes' film 'Max' explores early major turns in
Hitler's life, but, regretfully, we know how the whole thing turns
out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there were truth in advertising standards for film titles, "Max"
would never get away with calling itself "Max." At the very least it
would have to be "Max and Adolph" or maybe "Hitler: The Early Years,"
a behind-the-music look at the 20th century's greatest Satan when he
was the kind of young and footloose guy someone might actually ask,
"Do you want to meet some girls?"</LD>
<LD>   While the thought of the Fuhrer out on a date sounds like a scene
from the musical "Springtime for Hitler" that enlivened Mel Brooks'
"The Producers," "Max," written and directed by Menno Meyjes, wants
very much to be taken very seriously. Wouldn't it be instructive, the
film posits, to view Hitler as the human being he undoubtedly was and
examine the forces at work during the formative time he spent in 1918
Munich after World War I came, for Germany, to an ignominious end?</LD>
<LD>   It's an intriguing and reasonable notion, at least in theory, but
that apparently hasn't stopped any number of bloviators with way too
much time on their hands from publicly railing against this film for
daring to treat the Fuhrer as just folk. If anything, forgetting that
ultimate evil is always human is the perfect recipe for having it
return to decimate us all over again.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, just because people are objecting to "Max" for all
the wrong reasons doesn't make it a good film, and it's not. It's a
bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its
potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script,
unimpressive acting and indifferent direction.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the most consistently convincing aspect of "Max" is its
look. Producer Andras Hamori suggested the film be shot in his native
Budapest, where, among other things, a deserted train factory was
found that serves beautifully as the shabby chic Munich art gallery
that is the central to the story.</TE>
<TE>   The gallery is owned by Max Rothman (John Cusack), a wealthy
Jewish art dealer who comes fully equipped with an elegant wife
(Molly Parker) and a young, artistic mistress (Leelee Sobieski). Max
wanted to be an artist himself, but he lost his right arm during the
war. Now he devotes himself to selling the kind of unsentimental art
typified by the work of George Grosz, who makes a standard artist's
cameo appearance as a wild and crazy guy who says things like "I am
George Grosz, I am for sale."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Herr Hitler (Noah Taylor of "Shine" and "Almost
Famous") has remained in the German army, which provides minimal food
and a place to sleep. He is, no surprise here, a morose, easily
offended type, nursing dreams of artistic greatness along with a
vague distaste for the Jewish people, who he nevertheless admires for
preserving the purity of their blood.</TE>
<TE>   Max and Adolf meet and bond over their war experience as well as
their passion for art. The dealer, in part chagrined by the bleakness
of Hitler's life, keeps encouraging him to "go deeper" with his work.
"I have the feeling," he says, "that you're holding something back."
Hitler, for his part, feels art should reflect eternal values and
keeps getting distracted from the canvas by the army officer
("Celebration's" Ulrich Thomsen) who sees him as more promising as a
rabble-rouser than a painter.</TE>
<TE>   Though Cusack is always interesting and Taylor certainly looks the
part with a shock of black hair falling across his face, neither
succeeds in enabling his character to rise above the schematic.
Providing remarkably little help is the lackluster nature of the
words they have to work with.</TE>
<TE>   Because we can't help but know, even if these people do not, what
Hitler became, the film's dialogue has an added burden to overcome.
Unfortunately, "Max's" intentions end up being undercut by the innate
preposterousness of lines like "Hitler, come on, I'll buy you a glass
of lemonade" and "You're an awfully hard man to like, Hitler." While
the real Hitler must have had things like that said to him in real
life, it's beyond the ability of writer-director Meyjes to make them
sound real on film.</TE>
<TE>   Even if that dialogue could be ignored, the filmmaker (best known
for his equally earnest "The Color Purple" script) really ruins
things for himself with the film's contrived, fake-ironic ending. If
you're making a film about Hitler, the one thing you don't want to be
is glib, and that is one of the numerous pitfalls this debut director
hasn't had the skill to avoid.</TE>

<HD>Nicolas Cage's 'Sonny' surprises with its emotion</HD>
<DH>The world of prostitution is affectingly portrayed in the
actor's assured directorial debut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the deeply affecting "Sonny," Nicolas Cage displays the same
sensitivity, emotional resonance and daring in his feature
directorial debut that has characterized his splendid work in front
of the camera.</LD>
<LD>   In bringing John Carlen's much-admired but long-languishing script
to the screen, Cage has taken on a daunting challenge, requiring him
to confront the potentially sordid and exploitative with emotion and
empathy but also with clear-eyed clinical detachment. "Sonny" may be
modest in scale and budget, but in its way it is an ambitious
undertaking that by and large succeeds.</LD>
<LD>   Early one bright morning in New Orleans in 1981, a young man,
Sonny (James Franco), in an Army uniform strolls down vacant Bourbon
Street, its bars, strip clubs and jazz joints nearly silent but with
the debris of a long, rowdy night strewn about. At the end of the
commercial strip, Sonny stops in front of a large, old white
clapboard house. He has come home after completing his military
service, and as most mothers would be, Jewel (Brenda Blethyn) is
overjoyed to see him.</LD>
<TE>   Jewel and Sonny, however, are far from an ordinary mother and son.
Jewel is an aging former prostitute and now struggling madam, down to
just one girl, Carol (Mena Suvari), resilient yet vulnerable, who in
Jewel's estimation is "a hard worker, but she likes to give it away."
Far from having protected Sonny from her profession, Jewel takes
pride in having trained Sonny in her trade and turned him out at the
tender age of 12. By the time Sonny enlisted in an attempt to get
away and find himself, he was a local legend among a legion of
wealthy middle-aged women who could afford his services.</TE>
<TE>   Jewel is a flashy, tough, low-class dame, but she both adores
Sonny and looks to him to be the moneymaker he once was. (She insists
that Sonny is all she has to show for her life, but that she either
owns or manages to pay the rent on her French Quarter residence makes
it appear she is not without financial resources.)</TE>
<TE>   Jewel is taken aback, to say the least, by Sonny's announcement
that he has no intention of resuming a life of prostitution and
intends to go off to a small Texas town, where he has been promised a
job by an Army buddy (Scott Caan) in a bookstore owned by the buddy's
father.</TE>
<TE>   Jewel is skeptical of her son's making it in the "square" world,
especially with such meager prospects, but her longtime friend Henry
(Harry Dean Stanton), a professional thief and an avuncular figure in
Sonny's life, encourages him to give it a try, warning him, however,
that it will involve exchanging one set of problems and challenges
for another.</TE>
<TE>   In the seductively romantic antiquity of the French Quarter, it is
easy to recall that the city's notorious red-light district,
Storyville, stood (until 1949, though closed down in 1917) only a
short walk from Jewel's place and that Louis Malle's "Pretty Baby,"
set in Storyville, was based on the factual reminiscences of a woman
who had been turned out by her prostitute mother at the same age
Sonny was.</TE>
<TE>   Decadence hangs heavily in the atmosphere, underlining just how
hard it is for a handsome, personable young man of Sonny's formidable
sexual finesse to resist returning to the only thing he knows. That
Sonny loves and pities his mother, and that he and Carol are drawn to
each other add to Sonny's growing inner conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   The way Sonny's destiny unfolds is not so predictable, and it is
fully, often painfully, sometimes amusingly and always honestly
illuminated. Cage, who years ago had wanted to play Sonny, appears
briefly as a peroxided, coke-sniffing male madam long eager to
persuade Sonny to include men among his clientele.</TE>
<TE>   Cage unflinchingly depicts how unappealing Sonny's work truly is,
yet he is as compassionate to the fleshy older women he services as
he is to Sonny himself. (The fleshiest is played with amusing
exuberance by Brenda Vaccaro, as a woman who deludes herself to think
that she is the perfect partner for Sonny.)</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Cage has inspired trust from his actors, and "Sonny"
takes Franco and Suvari to a new level of accomplishment. Stanton is
indelible as usual. The ubiquitous and often excellent Blethyn,
however, proves problematic. There's never the feeling that she has a
handle on either a Southern accent or the character of Jewel, whom
she tends to let lapse into caricature. In short, she is miscast.</TE>
<TE>   The strength of "Sonny" is that it reveals the world of
prostitution as part of, rather than apart from, the larger world. It
is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental, and makes clear that a
prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients. The
day-to-day realities, especially economic, of Sonny and Jewel's lives
could have been more fully detailed to good effect, and Cage might
have also have risked setting off the tenderness of his storytelling
with an edgier style. Even so, few films take the viewer by surprise
with such emotional impact as "Sonny."</TE>

<HD>It's not Fosse's town, but 'Chicago' still has a kick</HD>
<DH>Rob Marshall's film version of the sizzling play owes a lot
to the fierce energy of Catherine Zeta-Jones.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since she landed in Hollywood a couple years back, the
Welsh-born actress Catherine Zeta-Jones has been playing the part of
an old-fashioned star with a vengeance. She made a splash in silly
(but lucrative) entertainments like "The Mask of Zorro" and
"Entrapment" in which she confidently flaunted her lush physicality,
only to turn around and flex her acting chops with a supporting role
in Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic." Few moments in that film were as
shocking as the image of the then-hugely pregnant actress seated
behind the wheel of a luxury SUV screaming obscenities into a cell
phone at her personal contract killer. Here was a star who really
acted like one.</LD>
<TE>   In "Chicago," Rob Marshall's film version of the 1975 musical
first staged by Bob Fosse, Zeta-Jones plays a different kind of
beautiful monster, Velma Kelley, a former habitue of the Chicago
stage now appearing in prison. The time is 1929, a time of
bootleggers and Tommy guns, and Velma has, as they used to say, done
her man wrong. (Her sister, too, whom she discovered en flagrante
with the deceased.) As far as Velma and her lawyer, Billy Flynn
(Richard Gere), are concerned, however, jail is just another public
relations opportunity. On stage, the showgirl had to share the
limelight with her sister, but whether she's putting in face time
with Billy at the courtroom or granting interviews from behind bars,
Velma now receives top billing. She's a Chicago star, like Al Capone.</TE>
<TE>   A star on the fade, alas. Velma isn't really the main attraction
in this iteration of the musical, which centers far more on the
trials of Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger), a would-be chorine who shoots
her lover (Dominic West) and begs her husband (John C. Reilly) to
take the rap. He does and then he doesn't, which is how Roxie lands
on the same prison block with her vaudeville idol, Velma. Aided by
Matron Mama Morton (an underused Queen Latifah), Roxie follows
Velma's lead, hires Billy Flynn and with his assistance transforms
into Chicago's newest tabloid sensation. As far as Roxie is
concerned, murderesses row isn't much different from tryouts in the
sticks. If you're not killed, you may hit the big time.</TE>
<TE>   Fosse based his 1975 musical on the Maurine Dallas Watkins play,
which in turn took its inspiration from cases she'd covered as a
journalist while working at the Chicago Tribune. (Frank Urson
directed one film version in the 1920s and nearly two decades later
Nunnally Johnson wrote another, "Roxie Hart.") Fosse's "Chicago,"
which he created with John Kander and Fred Ebb, is often marked for
its darkly cynical attitude toward the media and celebrity, a
cynicism which holds true only for those who have never seen plays
like "The Front Page" or films like "A Face in the Crowd." A quarter
of a century later, Fosse's ostensible cynicism, at least as
interpreted by Marshall, who also did the choreography for the film,
seems quaintly earnest. Denuded of satire, the musical now comes
across as another charming if creaky theatrical contrivance.</TE>
<TE>   For musical lovers, this likely won't matter. There isn't much
Fosse in evidence in this "Chicago," which means there's little
raunch and next to no heat, and Marshall has an exasperatingly
impatient filmmaking style. Like Baz Luhrmann in the superior "Moulin
Rouge," he simply refuses to sit still. Instead of letting his
performers just do their own thing, he chops up their bodies like
some lunatic cubist then frantically tosses the pieces around.
There's a reason why, when Fred Astaire started in movies, he
insisted that the cinematographer film his entire body; he wanted us
to see what he was doing. None of Marshall's three leads is truly up
to the demands of either the choreography or Kander and Ebb's sly
vaudeville pastiche, but it's maddening that for most of their
numbers, you're not allowed to fully watch them try.</TE>
<TE>   Energetic and eager to please, the three stars nonetheless appear
to be having a good time, with Gere, in particular, taking obvious
pleasure in his role as a press corps puppeteer. His matinee looks
stand up better to the film's grubby cinematography, as well, which
turns shadows into murky puddles and tends to be hard on Zellweger,
especially in close-up. It takes Zellweger some time to warm up,
although she finally does, but it's Zeta-Jones who keeps you watching
from start to finish. Whether bouncing into a split during "All That
Jazz" or vamping through "I Simply Cannot Do It Alone," she refuses
to let you go. You'd have to go back to Joan Crawford in her hungry
prime, in films like "Rain" and "The Women," to find another female
film star who grabs hold of the screen with such ferocity. If
musicals are dreams, she is their greatest dreamer.</TE>

<LD>If next Dec. 20 you should see me packing and ask where I'm going and
I say Las Vegas, you have my permission to knock me unconscious, tie
me to the bed and not release me until my head has cleared and my
senses are restored.</LD>
<LD>   The reason for that is at the moment I write it is Christmas Eve
and we have just returned from the Land of Dreams and Nightmares and
our tree isn't up, the presents aren't wrapped, the roof leaks and
we're expecting a house full of company tomorrow.</LD>
<LD>   We flew to Vegas to be with friends but for some reason failed to
anticipate that squeezing four days' work into about 12 hours on the
day before Christmas might border on the improbable and possibly even
the insane.</LD>
<TE>   Cinelli and I are great squeezers, but the yuletide season and Las
Vegas were never intended to be combined, although they do present a
nice dichotomy of piety and sin. The friend we went to Vegas to join
is going to have to change her birthday to September if she expects
to see us there again next year.</TE>
<TE>   I hadn't been to what many regard as L.A. East for a few years,
and discovered enough changes to fortify anyone's notion that America
is indeed the most decadent place on Earth. "But it's our right to be
decadent if we want to," a partygoer remarked on the 30th floor of
the Mirage, where the birthday celebration was being held. "That's
what freedom is all about." I'm not sure that freedom is all about
seeing topless showgirls kicking their long legs and old ladies
blowing their Social Security checks at the craps table, but I guess
there is an element of freedom in options.</TE>
<TE>   I kept thinking as we looked down on the glittery Strip, with its
erupting volcano, its Venetian canals, its hotel roller coaster, its
Eiffel Tower and its Statue of Liberty, that Osama bin Laden would go
nuts here. Not nuts with an increased hatred toward the U.S., but
nuts trying to keep up with the night life, not to mention the day
life. Sure, there's debauchery all around, but there's art too.</TE>
<TE>   Cinelli wanted to see the art, which was at the Guggenheim
Hermitage museum in the Venetian, where the canals are. Once in Las
Vegas, I wasn't that interested in pondering the works of
neoclassicist artists, I was there to do what the Romans probably
hadn't thought of yet. "The trouble with you," Cinelli said as we
stood before a painting by David Teniers the Younger, whoever he was,
"is you're so male." It was difficult to debate her contention that I
was, you know, male, so I just smiled stupidly and thought about the
topless show we had seen the night before at the Bally, in between
the Guggenheim art and a Bellagio Hotel collection of Faberge eggs.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know how Las Vegas, where nudity is next to probity, ever
got the idea of sandwiching art between sex and greed, but it works.
Appeasing decent people with art while their counterparts practice
moral depravity elsewhere is a stroke of genius. Sort of like leaving
the kids in a play area while daddy shoots the works downstairs.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't squeeze a lot of degeneracy into the time we had,
although I did whine and wheedle my way to the aforementioned show at
the Bally. Titled "Jubilee," it somehow managed to combine
semi-nudity and tumbling on the same stage to a degree that was both
curious and enticing.</TE>
<TE>   When a man reaches my age, he has most likely seen enough naked
mammary glands to accompany him into hell, but for some reason they
all seem new again when they're before you. But then after dozens of
beautiful, leggy, topless showgirls in spangles and feathers bounce
by in row after kicking row, you begin to wonder if there's going to
be any other kind of diversion.</TE>
<TE>   Well, sir, there's not only a high-wire act with muscular young
men swinging out over the audience, but there's also the sinking of
the Titanic, with all the accompanying screams and bravery and the
band playing "Nearer My God to Thee." This was the only part of the
revue that wasn't topless, which was something of a relief.</TE>
<TE>   Now I am home again and it's Christmas Eve and I'm disoriented and
behind in everything and a little crazy trying to get back on track.
I keep thinking of the surreal combination of art and degeneracy in
Vegas and wondering if it might not be a good place to invite Bin
Laden to visit. After a night out, he might even consider it the
Paradise he's been promising in his twisted interpretation of the
Koran, although I wouldn't count on a lot of virgins there if I were
him.</TE>

<HD>Redesigning and redefining the House of Halston</HD>
<DH>L.A. designer Bradley Bayou brings his celebrity style to
the American label.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Booth Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most people who recognize the name Bradley Bayou probably know him
for his daytime TV persona: He's a regular guest on the
estrogen-fueled kaffeeklatsch known as "The View" on ABC. On
Lifetime, he rescues the aesthetically challenged in a show called
"Operation Style."</LD>
<LD>   But he is also a fashion designer, and earlier this month, he was
named creative director for the American fashion house Halston, which
might be just the thing the long-suffering brand needs.</LD>
<LD>   Then again, it might be yet another futile attempt to rescue
Halston from licensing obscurity.</LD>
<TE>   Bayou follows a long list of designers who have tried
unsuccessfully over the last four years to resuscitate the Halston
name (Kevan Hall, Randolph Duke, among others), leading some to
wonder if the effort is even worth it. Others are optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "The name is still valid," said Joan Kaner, Neiman Marcus fashion
director. "It's like a lot of names that have lain fallow....If they
get the right person in there and allow them to do their thing, it
could be important."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Celebrity clientele</TE>
<TE>   Bayou, 46, who moved to L.A. from New York six years ago, is known
as a dressmaker for clients who can drop $1,500 and more on a
garment. He has a Robertson Boulevard boutique and a nearby design
studio, where the Halston line will be produced next fall.</TE>
<TE>   His roster of customers includes Halle Berry, Geena Davis and
Oprah Winfrey -- who wore his pale yellow gown so successfully to the
Emmys in February.</TE>
<TE>   One thing Bayou has in common with Halston is a surfeit of
charisma. Halston started his design career as a milliner, creating
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' famed pillbox hat. Later, he became known
for simple, modern clothes with clean lines -- notably caftans and
Ultrasuede shirt dresses -- and for late nights at Studio 54 with
Liza Minnelli, Bianca Jagger, Andy Warhol and others.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first celebrity-designers, he ushered in the era in
which fashion success depends as much on personality as talent.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s and '80s, Halston, who was among the first designers
to recognize the potential of licensing, signed myriad agreements for
products including eyeglasses, towels, luggage, uniforms for the Girl
Scouts, a clothing line for J.C. Penney and, of course, perfume. As
his business was bought by successively larger companies, the
pressure for profit grew.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to control the licenses and plagued by rumors of drug use,
Halston was effectively paid not to design by the companies that
owned his name. Until his AIDS-related death in 1990, Halston
struggled in vain to buy back his own name.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Teddy bear charm</TE>
<TE>   Like Halston, Bayou's design philosophy is decidedly democratic.
He is fond of saying, "I just want to make people look and feel
better." A bodybuilder with a hulking, 6-foot-3-inch frame, he cuts a
mean figure in tight black Comme des Garcons pants, a Calvin Klein
T-shirt and shiny Prada shoes. And despite his rather imposing
appearance, he's all Texas teddy bear charm, as eager to ask
questions as to answer them. ("Where you from?" "Where'd you go to
school?" "How long have you lived in L.A.?")</TE>
<TE>   Born Bradley Bayoud, he never had formal fashion training, but his
mother, Joan, owned several fashion boutiques in Dallas, and as a
child, he accompanied her on buying trips to Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Although he never met Halston, he did come close -- within a few
feet to be exact. "In 1978, my ex-wife and I went to Studio 54.
Halston was sitting there in a booth with Liza Minnelli and the
Rolling Stones. I was completely flabbergasted," Bayou said recently
over lunch at Morton's. "We went and sat behind the booth and
pretended like we were a part of his entourage. It was so cool."</TE>
<TE>   Career-wise, Bayou has had more lives than a cat. He started out
in Dallas as a real estate developer with a wife and two young
children. In 1988, he divorced, moved to Los Angeles to become a
painter and even had a few gallery shows.</TE>
<TE>   He fell into fashion in 1989 after seeing a segment on MTV's
"House of Style" about vests being a new trend. Thinking he could do
better than what he saw on the show, he marched down to the Salvation
Army, bought several men's tuxedo vests for $1.50 each and
hand-painted them with acrylics. The rest is Fred Segal history. A
friend took Bayou's creations to a buyer at the trend-setting L.A.
store, who placed an order on the spot. Soon, orders followed from
Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Barneys New York.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A vested interest</TE>
<TE>   Guessing that the vests would be a passing fad, he began making
painted and beaded gowns in 1990. The dresses sold quickly, and Bayou
debuted a full collection for the 1990 fall/winter season.</TE>
<TE>   After several pieces landed in the windows at Saks Fifth Avenue in
New York, he moved there and began showing during New York Fashion
Week.</TE>
<TE>   Although he continued to receive orders from Barneys and Saks, in
1996 his financial backer pulled out, he said. Bayou closed his
showroom doors and packed his bags for L.A.</TE>
<TE>   He opened his shop and legendary L.A. designer James Galanos, who
retired in 1998, brought him clients. (The two were introduced by
Bayou's sister, Laura Hunt, who married into the famous Texas family.
Bayou employs several seamstresses and patternmakers who once worked
for Galanos.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Branching into TV</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time, Bayou also started developing ideas for TV,
including "Operation Style," which debuted last year.</TE>
<TE>   On the show, a kind of lifestyle "Mission: Impossible," Bayou and
other experts are given design challenges from people who apply for
help. A homemaker wants to cook a romantic dinner for less than $100,
for example, or a working woman needs to redecorate a dining room in
one weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Bayou said he was approached by Halston for the job a few months
ago. It's not the first time the house has sought a Hollywood
connection. Piyawat Pattanapuckdee, who formerly worked for L.A.
designer Richard Tyler, designed the spring collection presented in
New York in September and sold in Saks and Nordstrom. And Hall and
Duke, both L.A.-based designers with a celebrity clientele, designed
for Halston briefly.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been good designers in place before," said James
Ammeen, chief executive officer of Neema Clothing, the privately held
parent company of the Halston name.</TE>
<TE>   "But the brand didn't have the overall direction and support that
it needed. It needed a spokesperson ... someone to live the brand,
speak the brand and promote the brand to the public," he said.
"Halston was bigger than life. He was a personality, he set trends.
When he was at a party people knew it. And Bradley will be very much
that way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Runway show in L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   Since acquiring Halston in 1999, Ammeen has pared down to only a
handful of licenses. He hopes now that the focus can be on the
designer collection, and that eventually Bayou will branch into
menswear and home furnishings. The first line of women's ready to
wear will include about 60 pieces. Instead of showing on a runway
during New York Fashion Week in February, Bayou said he wants to do
something different, possibly in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   He says the clothes will appeal to a range of women -- from the
18-year-old supermodel to the 50-year-old woman who has a luncheon to
attend, Bayou said, adding, "I really like people to look better.
That's what style is all about. If you just needed clothes, you could
wear a sack."</TE>

<LD>Nicole Eisenman has long been known for her humor -- a tool she
deploys to slice open social convention and skewer traditional
notions of gender and sexuality. Here, in a wonderfully stimulating
exhibition of new work, this humor assumes a rather sweet, even
poignant quality. The social critique is generally less overt than in
past work, but is gainfully fused in several works with what seems a
compassionate interest in issues of childhood and adolescence.</LD>
<LD>   "The Anxiety of Adolescent Boys Hanging Onto the Last Moments of
Their Innocence" (2002), for example, is a large painting in which a
1950s-era printed image of two boys swinging on a rope floats at the
center of a dense, yellow and orange storm of hellfire strewn with
Dante-esque knots of naked, groping bodies.</LD>
<LD>   It is an emotionally rich, albeit remarkably straightforward, work
in which the agile combination of classical and pop culture allusions
comes to seem not only effortless, but also strangely profound.</LD>
<TE>   Eisenman has worked in a wide variety of media successfully, but
the current exhibition benefits from its two-dimensional focus.
Fusing elements of Italian Renaissance painting, American social
realism, comic books and, in the paintings, fragments of found
photography, Eisenman has forged a rich and unique style.</TE>
<TE>   It's a pleasure simply to revel in the confidently sensual lines
of her drawings, to drift through the adventurous palette that
characterizes each painting and to wonder at the peculiar narratives
that animate her full-bodied figures.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the paintings are equally memorable, but the three or
four that stand out rank among the most interesting encountered in
recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most spectacular of these is "Mournful Tribute to the
Willow Tree by Troupe of Virginal Monster Children" (2002), in which
a gaggle of slightly green-skinned young girls in pink frocks stumble
toward the viewer across a flat turquoise field, flailing their arms
in a muted sort of hysteria.</TE>
<TE>   It's a bizarre but utterly hypnotic painting that lingers in the
memory long after one leaves the gallery.</TE>
<TE>   If Eisenman grapples, as many do, with the possibilities and
limitations of figurative painting in the contemporary world, she
lights upon a small revelation here: the capacity of such painting to
challenge the viewer's mental hold on the world by suffusing an
approximation of visual reality with an illogical emotional
resonance. The effect is entrancing.</TE>

<TE>   An unsettling path through girlhood</TE>
<TE>   The first photograph one encounters in "Girl Culture," Lauren
Greenfield's current exhibition at Stephen Cohen Gallery, depicts a
4-year-old girl named Allegra playing dress-up in a sunny Malibu
bedroom. Wearing a pink leotard and oversize gold lame shoes, she
assumes a pose of exaggerated femininity that might be construed as
mere play but for the alarmingly precise expression of runway-model
cool in the girl's striking blue eyes. Although too young to read,
Greenfield suggests, Allegra has already begun to master the
intricate codes of gesture and expression that go into the social
performance of female beauty.</TE>
<TE>   The photographs that follow -- which constitute about half of the
total number in Greenfield's recently published book of the same
title -- chart an unsettling path through the rites and rituals of
American girlhood.</TE>
<TE>   More than a little indebted to Joan Jacobs Brumberg's eye-opening
book "The Body Project: An Intimate History of American Girls," which
argues that despite major feminist advances during the last century,
girls are more dangerously body conscious today than ever before,
Greenfield focuses primarily on the ways in which these girls grapple
with their physicality.</TE>
<TE>   She tends toward extremes: weight-loss camps and eating disorder
clinics, debutante balls and bodybuilding competitions, strip clubs
and raunchy spring break gatherings in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, she proves herself an extremely talented
photojournalist with an acute sensitivity for the relationship
between subject and environment, as well as a knack for cultivating
images that are both communicative and visually compelling.</TE>
<TE>   It is not, on the whole, a cheerful story. There's little joy, it
seems, on either end of the beauty spectrum: the rail-thin actress
modeling Versace in the lobby of the Standard Hotel, or the homely
13-year-old Leah posing gloomily for her "before" picture at
weight-loss camp. Although these girls smile for Greenfield's camera
when it addresses them directly, their most common expression by far
is one of nervous preoccupation. These girls' bodies, to paraphrase
Barbara Kruger, are battlegrounds; they are accumulating scars,
visible and invisible, every day.</TE>
<TE>   One might argue that there's another side to this story -- the
girl-power angle. Greenfield's take is probably, on the whole, the
more realistic, and it is to her credit that she captures it with
such clarity.</TE>

<TE>   Battle of the gods of industry, nature</TE>
<TE>   German photographer Hans-Christian Schink spent six years -- from
1995 to 2001 -- tracking the development of a vast new network of
autobahns across the countryside of what was once East Germany. Given
plans for future routes and special access to construction sites, he
was able to observe the mechanics of the project at close range and
with a privileged familiarity.</TE>
<TE>   The series that resulted, however, now on view at Ace Gallery,
comes across less as a technological or sociological document than a
fantasy epic in which the gods of nature and industry battle it out
for control of the planet.</TE>
<TE>   The photographs are monumental, both in size (72 by 85 inches) and
composition. In each, some branch of the autobahn system -- a flat
freeway, a bridge, an overpass or a tunnel -- stretches across a
landscape of bucolic farmland. The concrete and iron structures,
often photographed at close range, are colossal and dauntingly
imperious in design. As Schink configures them, they look a lot like
soldiers in a sci-fi army of giants: mindless and inhumanly
efficient.</TE>
<TE>   The countryside, on the other hand, might as well have been
extracted from an 18th century romantic novel: There are green
fields, still ponds and picturesque valleys with rugged dirt paths,
along which one might expect to find a lumbering donkey cart loaded
with produce for market. The only signs of human life in the
photographs are a few clumps of modest farmhouses.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, Schink himself doesn't seem to have chosen sides in
this battle: He is as fascinated by the new structures as he is
nostalgic for the landscape. A native of East Germany, he's no doubt
aware of the political and historical implications of the region's
economic redevelopment, but he raises those issues to a symbolic
level here. In the stark contrast between freeway and landscape, one
discerns larger struggles between technology and nature, progress and
history, mobility and tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Visually articulate but resolutely impersonal, the photographs
leave to the viewer any conclusions regarding these issues.</TE>

<TE>   An elegant yet spare lesson</TE>
<TE>   "Voice Lessons," Claudia Matzko's exhibition at Angles, is a
studiously refined project that remains true at every turn to the
concept set forward in its title.</TE>
<TE>   One of the works is an elegant installation of bone props -- tiny,
capsule-shaped objects used to train the mouth and vocal cords --
that Matzko has cast in silver-plated bronze and embedded like a
constellation of stars in one of the gallery's walls.</TE>
<TE>   Another involves a live myna bird that is subjected every
half-hour to a passage of Henry Purcell's opera "Dido and Aeneas,"
and that may or may not be learning to repeat the principal phrase of
that passage, "Remember me."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most intriguing of the works -- although not
especially interesting to watch -- is "The Teacher" (2002), a video
projection involving an empty stage and four consecutive versions of
a song by Samuel Barber, the progression between which reflects the
teaching process itself. In the first, we hear only the voice of one
male tenor (presumably the teacher); in the second, both his voice
and that of a female soprano who then appears on the stage
(presumably the student); in the third, a digital combination of the
two voices; and in the fourth, only the soprano.</TE>
<TE>   It's a spare body of work: a few clever conceptual strands
threaded through a self-consciously minimal assortment of objects.
Unfortunately, none of these concepts comes through as a real
revelation. Many are difficult to infer from the objects themselves,
and, once revealed, fail to expand much with contemplation.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the show feels a little like a pleasant cocktail party
with too few hors d'oeuvres: With little for either the eye or the
mind to feast upon, one leaves disappointedly hungry.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Like the Dickens novel on which it's based, director Douglas
McGrath's "Nicholas Nickleby" overcomes the earnest blandness of its
eponymous hero with wonderful side characters. First and foremost is
the invaluable Nathan Lane doing double duty as the story's narrator
and as theater impresario Vincent Crummles, who befriends Nickleby
(Charlie Hunnam) on his flight from an evil school, Dotheboys Hall.
Accompanying Lane gloriously is Barry Humphries, who plays Mrs.
Crummles in his persona as Dame Edna without a suggestion of mockery,
confirming the suspicion that sometimes straying from the obvious is
the best idea.</LD>
<LD>   Having recently lost his father, Nicholas and his sister and
mother have been forced to throw themselves on the mercy of Nicholas
Sr.'s brother, a usurious businessman, Ralph (a terrific Christopher
Plummer). Ralph had found employment for his nephew at the school,
but Nicholas, appalled at the, well, Dickensian horror of the place,
has left, accompanied by the pitiful Smike (Jamie Bell), an orphan
whose adoration of his handsome friend borders on the, well, erotic.
Nicolas and Smike join Crummleses' theater company for about two
seconds before traveling on to London for the inevitable showdown
with Ralph.</LD>
<TE>   McGrath, who adapted the novel, manages to catch the flavor of it
without its tang. It would be hard to do otherwise, given the length
of the book, which teems with enough characters, subplots and
discursive descriptions to fill hours of a television miniseries.
Still, although he's had to contend with an embarrassment of
narrative riches, McGrath primarily suffers from a malady that can
affect filmmakers who take on classics. He's not irreverent enough.
He gives us Dame Edna, Tom Courtenay, Timothy Spall, Juliet Stevenson
and Alan Cumming (in a kilt!) but, like Smike, he can't keep his eyes
off Nicholas.</TE>

<HD>Micro art's big impact on digital</HD>
<DH>The Museum of Jurassic Technology's four tiny new
exhibitions draw on odd passions with haunting beauty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pagel</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four new exhibitions at the Museum of Jurassic Technology trace the
roots of digital technology back to the 19th century. They pull the
rug out from under the feet of visitors who think that the offbeat
institution is a throwback, and they demonstrate that the
idiosyncratic venue is ahead of its time -- and worlds apart from the
bigger-is-better ethos of high-profile museums.</LD>
<LD>   Compressing information like the most advanced gadgets, none of
the four little shows takes up much floor space. The two largest
occupy darkened galleries no bigger than many Beverly Hills closets.
Installed in hallways, the smaller two feel less like featured
presentations than playful invitations to pause on your way from one
room to the next.</LD>
<LD>   The first one you come across is "The Micromosaics of Harold
Dalton (1829-1912)." It's installed in a slender vitrine in the
middle of a hall already jam-packed with works on paper and
light-and-sound tableaux.</LD>
<TE>   Protruding from the display case's glass cover are the eyepieces
of eight ordinary microscopes. Each allows you to see one of Dalton's
tiny still lifes. About the size of a child's thumbnail, the
exquisitely rendered images depict a variety of flowers and ferns
tastefully arranged in vases and urns or as bouquets. Lizards,
chickens, birds and butterflies adorn every scene, giving the
little-known artist ample opportunity to indulge his love of
saturated color. Each image resembles a stained-glass window whose
iridescent palette covers the spectrum and includes such metallic
tints as copper, silver and gold.</TE>
<TE>   A wall label explains that every dot of color in Dalton's works is
a single section of a butterfly wing. In 1863, after contracting
tuberculosis, the English scientist moved to France, where he spent
his days capturing various species of butterflies. At night, he
dissected their wings and sorted the cellular sections by shape and
color. At the same time that the Impressionists were making paintings
by placing solitary dabs of paint side-by-side, Dalton was making
microscopic collages by arranging nature's most stunning colors in
harmonious compositions. Working with needles and single boar
bristles, he had to breathe through a glass tube to keep from blowing
the wing fragments away. When he completed a mosaic, he sandwiched it
between two sheets of glass.</TE>
<TE>   Dalton's art is a testament to the virtues of human patience; the
other hallway exhibition gives physical form to the volatile
relationship between culture and nature. "Rotten Luck: An Exhibit of
Failing Dice From the Collections of Ricky Jay" presents 30 antique
dice that are decaying so rapidly they seem to be crumbling before
your eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Mounted in seven glass boxes that recall the window displays of
fine jewelers, some look like sugar cubes dissolving in teacups.
Others appear to be rusting, suffering the effects of extreme heat or
prolonged exposure to subzero temperatures. Several ivory dice are
turning green, like moldy food, and a group of nine looks as if it
exploded.</TE>
<TE>   The magic of Jay's dice resides in the fact that nothing was done
to them to produce these extreme effects. After decades of unchanging
durability, they suddenly began to disintegrate. That's because they
were made of the first commercially viable form of plastic, an
unstable nitrate-based celluloid invented by John Wesley Hyatt in
1868. Jay's disfigured dice are modern memento mori, silent reminders
of life's unpredictability and the suddenness with which everything
can fall apart.</TE>
<TE>   The two largest exhibitions also feature the fusion of art,
science and entertainment. The first consists of nine vectographs,
3-D photographs from the collection of Susan Pinsky and David
Starkman. Mounted behind special goggles that sharpen the images, the
vectographs are crisp black-and-white images whose depth of field
mirrors that of the real world. What they depict (a film crew, a
Navajo weaver and a scientific diagram, among other scenes) is far
less interesting than how they do so -- with the vividness of the
real thing.</TE>
<TE>   A wall label explains that in 1939 Edwin H. Land unveiled the
vectographic process, in which two sheets of polarized film are fused
into one double-sided sheet. Unlike conventional 3-D images, which
require side-by-side images, vectographs effectively put two pictures
in one plane. This creates the impression, in the brain, that the
eyes are seeing volumetric objects. Unfortunately, high production
costs (and chemical instability) prevented vectographs from attaining
the popularity of ordinary photographs.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth exhibition features a new version of the vectographic
process. Developed by Julius J. Scarpetti and Vivian K. Walworth,
this process combines inkjet technology and a unique polarized
substrate to create hauntingly beautiful 3-D images.</TE>
<TE>   The 15 that make up "The Floral Radiographs of Albert Richards"
pay homage to the chemical engineer and physicist who patented X-ray
machines used in dental offices all over the world. Seen through
hand-held glasses, each backlighted image presents a
larger-than-life-size X-ray view of a fully blossomed flower. At once
ghostly and futuristic, the various roses, lady slippers, calla
lilies, jack-in-a-pulpits and star magnolias look like the
genetically engineered offspring of jellyfish and stealth bombers.</TE>
<TE>   As a group, the four exhibitions do for museums what the iPod does
for CDs: compress vast amounts of artistry into unbelievably small
spaces.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike music played over headphones, the works in these shows
do not promote social isolation. Rather than letting individuals get
lost in their own heads, they draw on odd passions and eccentric
expertise to inspire viewers to think freely and loosely -- to link
far-flung ideas and idiosyncratic experiences in ways that engage the
world's weird beauty.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors here have opened an investigation into whether the "Harry
Potter" series of children's books incites religious hatred, an
official said.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation was started at the request of a Moscow woman who
was upset by the novels, said Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for
the Moscow city prosecutor's office.</LD>
<LD>   Petrenko gave no further details on the complaint. The Interfax
news agency reported that the woman who sought the investigation
believes the second volume in the series -- known in the United
States as "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," the film
adaptation of which is currently playing in U.S. theaters -- contains
occult propaganda.</LD>
<TE>   Petrenko said an investigation is required under law when a
request is filed. Once the investigation is completed, prosecutors
will determine if any criminal charges will be filed, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Potter books have drawn some complaints in the United States
from parents who feel they promote wizardry as a religion.</TE>
<TE>   The Rosman publishing house, which has the license for Harry
Potter books in Russia, said it is "baffled" by the investigation.
Tatyana Uspenskaya, marketing director, noted the similar complaints
in other countries and said law enforcement officials hadn't become
involved elsewhere, Interfax reported.</TE>
<TE>   She said the publishers hadn't yet been contacted by prosecutors
because no criminal charges had been filed.</TE>
<TE>   The books by J.K. Rowling are popular in Russia and have inspired
a highly similar local version with a hero named Tanya Grotter,
prompting Rowling's publishers to threaten a lawsuit for plagiarism.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the category of New Year's resolutions, Pete Townshend of the Who
has pledged to work on a new studio album under the classic rock
band's banner, which would be its first since "It's Hard" in 1982.</LD>
<LD>   "Expect some new music to arrive in about a year, maybe later,"
the guitarist and songwriter said in a statement posted this week on
his Web site (www.petetownshend.co.uk).</LD>
<LD>   Townshend also wrote that he enjoyed a "very warm meeting" earlier
this month with Who singer Roger Daltrey, and goes on to say that he
wants his bandmate to have a substantial writing presence on the new
album -- a thought that might surprise longtime Who fans familiar
with the pair's jockeying for control in the band's glory years.</LD>
<TE>   "I am very keen too to see Roger find some creative outlet on this
future Who recording," Townshend wrote. "He is full of ideas, passion
and energy -- he bears quite a disturbed and serious view of the
world at the moment."</TE>
<TE>   Townshend and Daltrey are the only surviving original members of
the band after the drug-related deaths of drummer Keith Moon in 1978
and bassist John Entwistle last summer.</TE>

<HD>Eastwood sues biographer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actor Clint Eastwood has filed a $10-million libel suit against the
author and publisher of an unauthorized biography, which he says
portrays him as an atheist and wife abuser.</LD>
<LD>   In the suit, which was filed in federal court in San Jose,
Eastwood accused St. Martin's Press and Milwaukee author Patrick
McGilligan of lying about him and "setting out intentionally to
destroy [his] reputation -- both as a maker of motion pictures and as
a man."</LD>
<LD>   McGilligan, reached at his home in Milwaukee, stood by his book,
"Clint: The Life and Legend."</LD>
<TE>   "He has sued people religiously," McGilligan said. "He's made a
career of suppressing dissidence. I'm a very honest, factual reporter
who had no preconception of Clint Eastwood."</TE>
<TE>   The book was first published several years ago in England. It was
released in the United States in August.</TE>
<TE>   Eastwood wants $10 million in damages for the tarnishing of his
"reputation and standing in the community, mortification and
embarrassment." He's also asked for unspecified punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   McGilligan said he was upset but not surprised by the suit. "I'm
fascinated by how this little David in Milwaukee has hurt Goliath,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Cousteau film to focus on oil spill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jean-Michel Cousteau, the son of the late ocean explorer Jacques
Cousteau, hopes to capture the devastation of last month's massive
oil spill in northwestern Spain on film for a possible documentary,
the oceanographer and environmentalist said.</LD>
<LD>   The film team of his Santa Barbara-based Ocean Futures Society
plans to focus on the residents, workers and fishermen of A Coruna, a
town on the Galician coast. The tanker Prestige broke in two and sank
Nov. 19, about a week after it ruptured in a storm. Officials
estimate it spilled just under a quarter of its 77,000 tons of fuel
oil.</LD>
<LD>   Cousteau hopes the film can educate the public and force
governments to remove aging and obsolete oil tankers from the ocean.
"Thousands and thousands of people are completely out of work because
they were completely dependent on the ocean for their way of living,"
he said.</LD>

<HD>Dick Clark, that New Year's Eve idol, to get competition</HD>
<DH>Ryan Seacrest, 28, will go head-to-head against the
73-year-old TV host's annual Times Square bash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>"American Idol" host Ryan Seacrest is betting a swank casino setting
can help him steal some New Year's Eve viewers away from his idol,
Dick Clark.</LD>
<LD>   The Fox TV talent show host and Los Angeles radio disc jockey is
hosting a New Year's television concert special in Las Vegas that
pits him -- and Sin City -- against Clark's long-running Times Square
bash on ABC.</LD>
<LD>   "He's one of the people that I very much look up to," Seacrest
said. "It's exciting for me to be on television at the same time as
my idol. But I still want to win."</LD>
<TE>   Clark is 73. Seacrest turned 28 on Tuesday and thinks he can lure
viewers with the "young, sexy and hip" crowd that makes it inside an
invitation-only party at the lavish Venetian hotel-casino on the Las
Vegas Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's hourlong "America's Party" special at 11 p.m. Tuesday is to
include performances from Sheryl Crow, Ashanti and Sugar Ray. The
Rolling Stones and Bon Jovi will appear in taped segments.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's "Idol" winner, Kelly Clarkson, couldn't make it,
Seacrest said. She was busy in Florida working on a movie named after
the show.</TE>
<TE>   Seacrest promised the next "Idol" would include a more diverse
array of wannabe stars.</TE>
<TE>   "We captured a huge spectrum of different talent this time," he
said. "There's jazz vocalists, blues singers and rockers. I don't
think we had all of our bases covered last year."</TE>
<TE>   More than 50,000 tried out for the hit show's second season. About
200 went to Los Angeles for taped auditions that will be broadcast on
the Jan. 21 premiere. Live episodes featuring 32 finalists begin
airing in early February.</TE>

It's time to write a letter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joan Springhetti</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear McDonald's Corp.,</LD>
<LD>   What a downer about your stock tanking. I'm not among your
stockholders (at least I don't think so, but with all these mutual
funds, who knows?), but like many Americans, I am a former employee
and an occasional customer.</LD>
<LD>   Since your stunning announcement that you are shutting down 175
stores, I have been disoriented. McDonald's opens restaurants, it
doesn't close them!</LD>
<TE>   It's taking awhile for the news to sink in: McDonald's, the
company that invented supersizing, is downsizing. You've named a new
CEO to step in Jan. 1, and have announced you will "close three
countries" and restructure four. You could not have shaken us more if
you had announced you were switching from Coke to Pepsi.</TE>
<TE>   At your very heart has always been the belief that we live in an
ever-expanding universe, one full of infinite possibilities for the
spread of your systems and meal plan. You've always been a leader
(you make a dollar menu, Burger King follows with a 99-cent one) and
ready to fry new foods (pie!).</TE>
<TE>   It was while working for you that I learned about the importance
of not simply giving customers their food, but of presenting it. I
learned that "If you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean."
And I learned through your unprecedentedly detailed training films
how to settle a shake, wrap a burger, dress a bun, salt fries -- and
to place orders with precision in crisply opened paper bags before
sliding them smoothly forward across a shiny clean counter into the
hands of valued customers.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, I stopped in at the McDonald's where I used to work and
hardly recognized the place. Sure, you had added a Playland, but
that's not what threw me: You had put in one of those self-serve soda
fountains. Where's the presentation in that? It just seems so
Wendy's.</TE>
<TE>   Also, there didn't seem to be the masses of people coming in. I
remember how the lunch and dinner crowds and tour buses seemed
endlessly to be pulling into the parking lot. We were really cooking
then, huh? You know, I was one of the few who could run a rolling
double-48 on the grill (that's 96 little all-beef patties sizzling at
once) -- but then, of course, I couldn't have done it without the
unflinching support of a crack bun crew.</TE>
<TE>   But I digress. It was you who turned fast food in this country
into a system, into a cash cow, and took the concept to new
continents. It is in some of those newer markets that you're pulling
back -- in Latin America and the Middle East. You say that the stores
you are closing are under-performing. Are they not in strong traffic
centers? Has quality control been uneven? Or is it a trickier issue,
such as a finite IEO (Informal Eating Out) market?</TE>
<TE>   You have more than 30,000 stores sprinkled across the universe.
Not evenly of course, the greatest concentration is right here in the
USA, where, let's face it, the market was ripe for the picking back
when Ray Kroc saw what a great thing Dick and Mac McDonald had going
over in San Bernardino. Some parts of the world have been totally
with the game plan -- like Japan, where the teriyaki burger has been
a hit and you squeezed 2,400 restaurants into a very small space.
Europe has been tougher -- just 1,200 sites in the U.K., 900 in
France and 230 in Italy. They are so full of Old World ideas over
there about food and dining, aren't they? Then there's all this
anti-globalization and mad cow disease.</TE>
<TE>   Has the universe simply gotten too unruly? Or are 121 countries
just too many to keep track of? I'm sure the customers who've learned
to love the Big Mac in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Brazil,
Bolivia, Peru and Guatemala are nervous -- just as I would be if I
thought the franchises in my neighborhood might vanish.</TE>
<TE>   I know you're still grappling with all this, but I don't doubt
that just as you have always charged ahead with McConfidence, you
will pull back with it.</TE>
<TE>   All the best in the new year.</TE>

<HD>Difficult 'Emigrants' goes deep</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. Kathleen Foley;Philip Brandes</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First produced in 1975, "The Emigrants," by eminent Polish playwright
Slawomir Mrozek, conceals a cargo of sly social protest under a layer
of philosophical obtuseness. As with much drama from the Cold War-era
Eastern bloc, the play is unwieldy, laborious and pointedly
discursive, a kind of coded message intended to blind the watchdogs
of totalitarianism to its subtly dissident themes.</LD>
<LD>   Director Neno Pervan, working from a translation by Henry Beissel,
effectively tightens the dialectic of Mrozek's often rambling
two-person play in his crisp and no-frills staging. Neatly skirting
caricature at every turn, Tim Choate and Zoran Radanovich convey
their characters' comical desperation without pandering to their
obvious absurdities.</LD>
<LD>   Choate plays AA, a political dissident from an unnamed country who
has fled to another unnamed country, where he lies low -- literally
-- in a squalid basement flat (Lada Pervan's nicely realized set)
that he shares with his countryman XX (Radanovich). In dramatic
contrast to the cerebral AA, XX is a brutish laborer who hopes to
make a fortune abroad and return home in glory to his wife and
children someday. Yet, as the play progresses, it becomes obvious
that both are as trapped in their present circumstances as night
crawlers in a roach motel.</LD>
<TE>   In essence, the play is simply a prolonged conversation, starting
with prosaic observations about bus stops and insects and progressing
to a penetrating discussion about the roles of slaves and masters in
a dictatorship. Bitter arguments follow at every twist in topic, and
violence threatens to erupt at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   Not for escapists, this is difficult material, well done by a
capable company. Arduous and at times difficult to follow, it may
reward those who brave its obscurities.</TE>
<TE>   -- F. Kathleen Foley</TE>
<TE>   "The Emigrants," Coronet Studio, 366 N. La Cienega Blvd., Los
Angeles. Jan. 9-11, 8 p.m. Ends Jan. 11. $18. (310) 657-7377. Running
time: 1 hour, 40 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Shakespeare rides the wild range</TE>
<TE>   Many a casual punster might have been content with a comic riff on
John Wayne as the Duke in "As You Like It," but it took a true
devotee of the genre to map western movie icons onto every character
in Shakespeare's classic comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Jaz Davison's inventive staging concept mines goofy, unexpected
laughs in "As Ya Like It ... Pardner" at Pasadena's Knightsbridge
Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   That the script actually calls for two Dukes poses no problem;
Derik Van Derbeken proves equally capable portraying the usurper Duke
as the stiff, U.S. Cavalry-suited Wayne of "Red River" and the
banished good Duke as the more affable, pastoral Wayne of "She Wore a
Yellow Ribbon."</TE>
<TE>   Other inspired associations include a stuttering Jimmy Stewart
(John Gorman) as the timid romantic doormat Silvius and Melancholy
Jaques reinvented as that archetypal loner Alan Ladd (Jesse Harper)
-- cries of "Jakes! Jakes!" echoing at his departing figure slyly
spoof the ending of "Shane."</TE>
<TE>   Even peripheral characters are fair game: The aged servant Adam
becomes a crotchety Walter Brennan in Rich Williams' spot-on vocal
impersonation, the prankster Touchstone is a befuddled Ken Curtis
(Art Oden) and the wrestler Charles (Clint Von Hummel), bested by the
hero Orlando in an early scene, morphs into a sneering Jack Palance:
"You thought I was dead, didn't you? Believe it -- or not."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, you need to be steeped in an unusually deep cultural
heritage to fully appreciate the intricate allusions here. Some
familiarity with the incidental plotting and dialogue by Billy
Shakespeare is also a plus, though it does appear to create
additional challenges for Jen Nikolaisen, whose plucky heroine
sometimes drops her tough-as-nails Joanne Dru persona to convincingly
depict Rosalind's fuller range of emotional nuances. Spoilsport.</TE>
<TE>   With such a large ensemble called upon to impersonate well-known
stars, some performances inevitably fall short of the conceit.
There's no trace of Montgomery Clift's agonized brooding in Daniel S.
Joseph's Orlando; Celia (Megan Kay) is only recognizable as Natalie
Wood by her Indian outfit from "The Searchers."</TE>
<TE>   Fun though the concept may be, more creative energy has gone into

<TE>   Cliches dominate 'Without Mother'</TE>
<TE>   In a time when splintered families are all too commonplace,
writer-director Cindy Teruya's "Life Without Mother" at American
Renegade Theatre tackles an admirably urgent theme: long-separated
siblings who meet as they prepare to begin their adult lives.</TE>
<TE>   Both concept and characters show promise. An unseen druggie mother
exacts a terrible psychic toll on her three children: studious,
uptight Marcus (Jonathan Sela), ground into milquetoast by having to
shoulder head-of-household responsibilities prematurely; feisty,
rebellious Julia (Hillary Klein); and confused Jacob (Steve Spencer).</TE>
<TE>   Split up by social services, the children follow different paths
in their foster homes. Jacob is adopted by wealthy Bostonians who
change his name to Stewart. Klein's Julia remains hopelessly mired in
poverty and eventually, in the play's best performance, tries to lose
herself in self-destructive sex. As for Marcus, well, once a nerd,
always a nerd.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, in its awkward construction and shaky
implementation the play rarely finds a convincing emotional footing;
instead, it settles for far too many dramatic cliches and superficial
characterizations.</TE>
<TE>   What are we to make of Stewart's meaningless one-night stand with
a manipulator (Suzan Babaa), when he's already met a girl (Kate
Gopaoco) who's offered him genuine caring and loyalty? He's hardly in
a position to pass judgment on his sister's lifestyle when they meet
up.</TE>
<TE>   That meeting comes way too late in the game, after a succession of
scenes that merely skim turbulent waters. The problems crystallize
with the continuing reliance on a pair of angels to fill in the
characters' holes with exposition, including concluding
single-paragraph summaries of the rest of their lives. Leo Tolstoy
claimed that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, but this
generic, opaque muddle seems out to prove him wrong.</TE>

<TE>   Laughing all the way: 'Santasia'</TE>
<TE>   Santa's elves are mad as hell, and they're not going to take it
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   In a nutshell, that's the thin but serviceable conceit behind
"Santasia Rocks," a wacky evening of Christmas-themed sketch comedy
running through this weekend at the Whitmore-Lindley Theatre in NoHo
(make that NoHoHoHo). A critic could have a field day belaboring
comical metaphors for "Santasia." Let's just say this production is a
lot like a holiday cheese log -- a cheesy filling of dubious origin
surrounded by a bunch of nuts. In this case, the nuts are the show's
ensemble -- Michael Alvarado, Chris Cause, Kit Davlin, Andrew J.
Hillis, Erick Lopez, Brandon Loeser and Shaun William Loeser.
Brothers, the Loesers produced the newly reworked show, originally
developed in Chicago, for its third Los Angeles engagement. The
latter Loeser directs.</TE>
<TE>   Engaging filberts all, the performers roll in the prevalent
cheesiness with infectious abandon. And Shaun Loeser's scenic design
-- all glitz and tinsel and hilariously low-budget "effects" -- is in
the same appropriately cheesy vein.</TE>
<TE>   If the cheese images are wearing thin, let's jumble the metaphor.
The ensemble-scripted material ("Santasia" gets the writing credit
here) is a mixed bag, including a few packages that should be
returned to sender. More often than not, though, the bountiful laughs
come tightly wrapped. Interstitial video segments, including the
parody promo "Elves Gone Wild," is a gold-plated hoot. The movement
sequences, such as a mimed sledding sketch, smartly executed on this
tiny stage, are particularly inspired. And the evening's "Full Monty"
finale is a side-splitter that may leave your rental Santa suit in
shreds.</TE>

<TE>   Sugary plot weakens 'Holiday'</TE>
<TE>   If you know someone in the cast, you'll probably want to see "A
Jolly Holly Holiday" at the Norris Center for the Performing Arts.
Otherwise, you may feel like you are attending a big neighborhood
block party where you don't know a soul.</TE>
<TE>   This "original musical," written and directed by Michael Sartor,
is really glorified community theater. Oh, some of the people
involved have professional theater credits. Mostly, however, the
performances are about as good as you would see in your average
Christmas pageant.</TE>
<TE>   The setting is the fictional town of Cedar Falls, a community that
has a history of bad luck at Christmastime. Pies don't get baked in
time, the children's choir is unrehearsed and, for the last three
years, the town Christmas tree has shorted out during the annual
tree-lighting ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, little Annabelle (Alison Ford Kaufman) has been asking
for a puppy for so long, she's about to give up on the meaning of
Christmas. But when Mrs. Santa Claus (Brandee Williams) comes to
town, strewing glitter and Christmas magic, trees light without
problem, pies win contests and Christmas arrives on schedule -- right
along with Annabelle's gift-wrapped puppy, not to mention the town's
absent soldier, who has been off at an unnamed location fighting for
democracy and the American way.</TE>
<TE>   That simple-minded plot is just the packaging for what is
essentially a revue of holiday music, performed to uneven effect by
an amateurish cast. Sartor contributed a couple of original songs as
well as a few rewritten parody lyrics for old standards ("The Most
Wonderful Time of the Year" resurfaces as "The Most Fattening Time of
the Year" and so on.)</TE>
<TE>   Be forewarned. Unalloyed cuteness may cause Scrooge-like symptoms
in even the most ardent holiday buffs. If you haven't already
overloaded on the glutinous plot, pie is served at intermission, and
caramel corn is handed out as you exit the theater, yet more
sugar-coating on this sticky holiday fare.</TE>

<LD>MARIA and Alfonso were spending a few days at the lodge where Uncle
Ruben worked as a nature guide in the San Bernardino Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   They were taking a short walk up to the hill where all the pine
trees grow. Uncle Ruben wanted the children to see how to collect the
pine nuts from the trees.</LD>
<LD>   "Wow, look at all these big cones," said Maria.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't know they grew so big," said Alfonso, eagerly picking
one up. He quickly dropped it as the sharp prickles of the cone's
scales poked his fingers.</TE>
<TE>   "Ouch!" complained Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, be careful," said Uncle Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   "In the old days, the Indian people would shake out the nuts from
these cones and eat the seeds, like so," explained Uncle Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   After they finished collecting seeds, Uncle Ruben put some on a
flat rock.</TE>
<TE>   "See how it's done," said Uncle Ruben. "You put the seed here and
then gently hit it with another rock. Presto, the white edible
portion breaks out and you have food from the forest."</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso quickly ate one, declared it delicious and started to
crack more.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to take some of the cones back to the lodge for
tonight's fire," said Uncle Ruben, "but I didn't bring a pack. I want
you children to watch as I make one from my sweatshirt."</TE>
<TE>   They both stared at him in surprise as he took off his
long-sleeved sweatshirt. Using a small piece of twine, he tied off
the neck and filled the body of the sweatshirt with cones. When it
was full, he tied off the waist of the sweatshirt with more twine,
then tied off the wrists and finally tied each wrist of the
sweatshirt to the waist. Using the arms of the sweatshirt as the pack
straps, he put on the "pack."</TE>
<TE>   They walked back to the lodge, the children laughing the entire
way.</TE>

<LD>Shirley Temple Black is 74, but she still seems as energetic and
cheerful as when her famous dimples and curly hair captivated the
country decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   On Christmas, Fox Movie Channel aired "ShirleyMania," a
documentary about the continuing phenomenon of "the best little girl
in the world," the childhood star of such films as "Curly Top"
(1935), "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" (1938) and "The Little Princess"
(1939).</LD>
<LD>   "Who knew?" Black says. "I didn't."</LD>
<TE>   Black said she hasn't seen her movies on television in a while.</TE>
<TE>   "But if there is one thing I would like to say, it is how much I
enjoy that people think of me, especially those of all ages," she
told the San Francisco Chronicle. "You know, I get a lot of kids at
my house for Halloween. And one year a little girl came up and said,
'Are you really Shirley Temple?' And I said, 'Yes, Shirley Temple
Black.' She looked at me for a long time in silence and then she
said, 'I see the resemblance.' "</TE>

<HD>Wooden-headed 'Pinocchio'</HD>
<DH>Although lavishly made, the Italian film, directed by and
starring Roberto Benigni, is self-serving, lifeless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roberto Benigni's "Pinocchio," the most expensive Italian movie ever
made, with a $45-million budget, opened in Italy in October with
tremendous fanfare at a record 860 theaters -- and also a record
weekend take estimated at $7.9 million, overriding mixed reviews. By
contrast, it opened in America in a dubbed version, ostensibly the
better to connect with the family trade, on Christmas Day with little
hullabaloo and no press previews, which is scarcely encouraging.</LD>
<LD>   While it's hard to imagine that in Italian it would seem anything
but a stultifying monument to Benigni's self-indulgence, it could
conceivably at least have come alive, if only fitfully. Although
technically a superior example of dubbing in regard to intelligent
English speech coming out of Italian mouths in reasonably good
synchronization, the film nevertheless remains stubbornly moribund.
That's because the English dialogue track has that dreaded hollow and
colorless sound of most dubbed movies, and its flatness is further
underlined by the contrasting richness of Nicola Piovani's lovely
score.</LD>
<TE>   This "Pinocchio" in fact is lovely to look at, the final work of
late, great production and costume designer Danilo Donati, who built
a charming medieval town whose citizens are dressed in clothes
inspired by Daumier prints, which would set the story roughly in the
era when Carlo Collodi wrote it in 1881. Among the many confections
Donati created are a red plush and baroque gilt circus arena, a vast
interior of a whale filled with such picturesque detritus as a ship's
prow complete with figurehead and, for Pinocchio's mentor, the Blue
Fairy (Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's wife and producer), an exquisite
Gothic castle and a mice-driven coach so gossamer as to outshine any
conceived for Cinderella (or owned by Elizabeth II).</TE>
<TE>   But the film is all too literally an instance of "all dressed up
and no place to go." As the wooden puppet who yearns to be human,
Benigni, again directing himself in his first outing since the
seriously overrated "Life Is Beautiful," is steadfastly insufferable,
from his naughty, naive stage through a transformation to a state of
virtue that is steeped in a self-congratulatory martyrdom and
nobility.</TE>
<TE>   When Benigni starred in Federico Fellini's 1990 "Voice of the
Moon," Fellini envisioned making a "Pinocchio" with Benigni, and with
his seductive and often profound visionary style, he might well have
pulled it off. Would that Benigni had let the idea die with the
maestro.</TE>

<HD>A night of song and dance honors Kennedy Center's all-star
lineup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Years ago, an excited Paul Simon called Steve Martin to tell him he
had just finished writing a song called "47 Ways to Leave Your
Lover." Martin suggested "50 Ways" would have a better ring, but
Simon said he couldn't think of any more.</LD>
<LD>   "What about 'Make a new plan, Stan, don't need to be coy, Roy,
drop off the key, Lee'?"</LD>
<LD>   At least that's how a deadpan Martin remembers it.</LD>
<TE>   Good humor and great talent are on display tonight in "The 25th
Annual the Kennedy Center Honors: A Celebration of the Performing
Arts" (9 p.m., CBS), a glittery salute to Simon, Elizabeth Taylor,
James Earl Jones, Chita Rivera and conductor James Levine.</TE>
<TE>   The night starts on an uneven note, with a frustratingly short
reel of Taylor clips in movies including "A Place in the Sun" and
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" followed by a musical number,
Stephen Sondheim's "Not Getting Married." It must have seemed like an
amusing choice to honor the oft-wedded diva, but it probably works
better in context.</TE>
<TE>   Sidney Poitier and other actors offer an emotional tribute to
Jones, the shy country boy who grew up to become a commanding stage
and screen presence.</TE>
<TE>   Poitier concludes with a quote from Jones: "I'm not big and strong
to myself, so I like to play characters who reveal their conflicts
and vulnerabilities. I don't have to find the answers but to explore
the mystery that lives inside each one of us."</TE>
<TE>   A song-and-dance medley honoring Rivera glides from the lively
"West Side Story" number "Dance at the Gym" featuring Charlotte
d'Amboise, to the title track from "Kiss of the Spider Woman" sung by
Donna Murphy, to Valarie Pettiford's sultry "All That Jazz" from
"Chicago."</TE>
<TE>   Placido Domingo, who has done 300 operas with Levine, remembers
the first, when he was told that conducting "Tosca" would be the
young maestro "Laveenay." Levine turned out to be a kid from
Cincinnati, not an Italian -- but that didn't keep him from later
leading New York's Metropolitan Opera to new heights.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon tribute features Alicia Keys singing the wistful "Bridge
Over Troubled Water" and James Taylor teaming with Alison Krauss on
"The Boxer."</TE>
<TE>   For the finale, a chorus of stars joins in on the blissful "Loves
Me Like a Rock." Even President Bush, watching from the balcony, is
clapping his hands and tapping his feet.</TE>

<HD>The hour has come</HD>
<DH>The Pulitzer-winning novel shouldn't work as a studio film,
but it does -- splendidly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Cunningham's "The Hours" is a superlative piece of fiction, a
novelist's novel that became a surprise bestseller and won the
Pulitzer Prize. But, paradoxically, the very things that made it so
impressive militated against any kind of successful studio film
emerging out of its pages.</LD>
<LD>   "The Hours" is exquisitely written, graced with a gift for elusive
emotions and an effortless ability to delineate interior lives. And
it has a complex, multilayered plot that intertwines the stories of
three women in three different time periods, women linked by their
despair and the difficulty they have in finding places for themselves
in the world. This trio also share a relationship to yet another
fictional woman, the title character of Virginia Woolf's "Mrs.
Dalloway." All in all, definitely not the kind of situation Hollywood
is most at home with.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, almost against reason, "The Hours" has turned out to be a
splendid film.</LD>
<TE>   It uses all the resources of cinema -- masterful writing, superb
acting, directorial intelligence, an enveloping score,
top-of-the-line production design, costumes, cinematography and
editing -- to make a film whose cumulative emotional power takes
viewers by surprise, capturing us unawares in its ability to move us
as deeply as it does.</TE>
<TE>   For perhaps the best thing about "The Hours" is the fearlessness
of its emotionality. Stephen Daldry, a noted British theater director
whose debut film was "Billy Elliot," is not frightened of strong
feelings but instead embraces them in a way that is often
incompatible with the kind of intelligence and restraint that also
characterizes "The Hours."</TE>
<TE>   But though the emotion sometimes overwhelmed "Billy Elliott," it
is well under control here, a situation that in part results from
David Hare's spare, eloquent script, which in turn benefited from his
decision to write it without flashbacks and without voice-overs (with
the sole exception of Woolf reading her own words.)</TE>
<TE>   While the script departs from the novel in places, it is
remarkably faithful to the original's tone and spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Daldry also works well with performers, in this case primarily
actresses, and in "The Hours" he got to collaborate with three of the
best. Nicole Kidman is galvanizing as Virginia Woolf, Meryl Streep is
right behind her as a contemporary Manhattan version of Woolf's Mrs.
Dalloway and Julianne Moore is also strong as a 1951 Los Angeles
housewife whose life is changed by Woolf's book.</TE>
<TE>   Daldry's success in making "The Hours" an enlarging, fortifying
experience is especially impressive because the themes involved are
not automatically uplifting ones.</TE>
<TE>   Even the title's reference to the time we have before us is
capable of being interpreted in opposing ways, as a span of hopeful
possibility or an agony that must be endured.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, though not everyone in the piece does so, "The Hours"
is about choosing life over death, about why we persist in holding on
to our existence despite the pain it is sure to cause us. It's about
those things we don't say because they don't fit into words, a film
of lost feelings, strange unraveling moods and the importance of what
lies beneath the surface.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hours" is not afraid to admit how terrifyingly alone we can
be, how deep the chasms between individuals are, how little we care
to or are even able to let others into our emotional lives. Yet it
shows not only how critical but also how fragile are the attachments
we do form.</TE>
<TE>   As Streep's contemporary character says about a particularly
intense moment, "I remember thinking, 'This is the beginning of
happiness.' That's what I thought. 'So this is the feeling. This is
where it starts. And of course there'll always be more.' It never
occurred to me: It wasn't the beginning. It was happiness. It was the
moment, right then."</TE>
<TE>   It is, finally, the joy we take in these brutally
brief connections, the push-pull between how fleeting yet how indelible
these small moments are, that is life's hard-won balm, that is what
we treasure even as we learn how evanescent any kind of pleasure can
be. As Woolf says of her characters in the midst of creating "Mrs.
Dalloway," "Someone has to die so the rest of us can value life
more."</TE>
<TE>   It is Woolf we are introduced to first, in a brief prologue set in
1941, the year of her suicide.</TE>
<TE>   After that "The Hours" alternates among three worlds, each finely
re-created by production designer Maria Djurkovic. There is Woolf in
1923, simultaneously recovering from a mental collapse and in the
throes of writing "Mrs. Dalloway." There is 1951's Laura Brown, at
sea to the point of drowning in marriage and motherhood. Finally,
there is 2001's Clarissa Vaughn, intent on giving a celebration
dinner for her best friend, who has just won a major poetry prize but
is dying of AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   While Cunningham's book emphasized the interconnectedness of these
lives by alternating chapters about each of them, "The Hours" goes it
one better, especially in its early stages, by confidently and
intimately intercutting the stories by means of parallel gestures and
words.</TE>
<TE>   So, in a tightly cut sequence (Peter Boyle is the editor) about
the three women awaking, both Kidman's Woolf and Streep's Vaughn make
the identical gesture in putting up their hair. When Woolf bends
forward to splash water on her face, the next image shows Vaughn
pulling her face out of a basin. When we see Woolf writing "Mrs.
Dalloway's" first line, that's followed by Laura Brown reading it and
Vaughn saying the modern version, "I think I'll buy the flowers
myself."</TE>
<TE>   As the film progresses, more thematic elements, on the order of
passionate kisses, are repeated as well. This may sound gimmicky, but
it is just the opposite, an exhilarating reveling in film's power to
seduce the mind into making the kinds of connections, instantaneous
as well as meaningful, even novels can't always manage.</TE>
<TE>   With its own emphasis on repetition, Philip Glass' lush score
enhances these connections, heightening the film's emotional quotient
and giving the story added grandeur, melancholy and uneasiness.</TE>
<TE>   As Cunningham himself wrote in liner notes to the score, "We are
creatures who repeat ourselves, we humans, and if we refuse to
embrace repetition -- if we balk at art that seeks to praise its
textures and rhythms, its endlessly subtle variations -- we ignore
much of what is meant by life itself."</TE>
<TE>   Though Woolf is not the most electrifying character in
Cunningham's book, she is that on screen, with full credit going to
Kidman's piercing performance, a powerful piece of acting that is
unsettling in the best sense.</TE>
<TE>   Unrecognizable in a false nose and Ann Roth's excellent costumes,
Kidman has gotten a death grip on this character. Completely
inhabiting the role, she allows us to feel, especially in scenes with
her sister Vanessa (the always reliable Miranda Richardson), how
agonizing it is for her to be banned from the excitements of London
on doctor's orders.</TE>
<TE>   We also see the controlled turmoil of creativity, understanding
intuitively what a key moment it is when Woolf says to husband
Leonard (an immaculate Stephen Dillane), "I believe I may have a
first sentence." These two share the film's strongest scene, a train
platform argument about returning to London that ends with Virginia's
poignant belief that "you do not find peace by avoiding life."</TE>
<TE>   Though the nature of her character mandates that her performance
will not be as showy, Streep is subtle and devastating as Clarissa
Vaughn, a contemporary New Yorker nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway and, like
her namesake, a confident hostess who can bring irresistible
enthusiasm to phrases like "Let's just have buckets of roses."</TE>
<TE>   Also like the original Mrs. Dalloway, Vaughn is shown on a single
day, preparing for a party, but a day fraught with personal baggage.
The guest of honor, poet Richard (Ed Harris, at times trying too hard) is
not only a friend ravaged by disease but a former lover before both of
them found same-sex partners (Allison Janey plays hers; Jeff Daniels an
old beau of his).  Playing a caregiver intent on holding things together,
making the conveying of complex emotions seem like second nature, Streep
(who appears as herself in "The Hours") gives a beautifully modulated
performance whose seeming artlessness makss a wealth of skill.</TE>
<TE>   Coming between these two chronologically, the 1951 Los Angeles
section starring Moore as a desperate housewife is, though handsomely
mounted, the most problematic part of the film.</TE>
<TE>   In part this is because the tone Daldry has chosen for the segment
is less natural and more stylized than the others (witness John C.
Riley's obsequious, artificial turn as husband Dan Brown). It's also
because Mrs. Brown, alone of the three women, lacks someone she can
have an honest conversation with and so, without the book's interior
monologues to fall back on, her intentions and thought patterns are
inevitably more opaque than those of her co-protagonists. But even
with its flaws, this section still functions as it should as a key
component of the piece's intricate dance of relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Though "The Hours" makes expert use of both the contemporary novel
and "Mrs. Dalloway," you don't need to know anything about either to
enjoy this films' lushly photographed (by Seamus McGarvey) riches.
All you need is an openness to emotion and a mature empathy for the
vicissitudes of human need. A Woolf voice-over that serves as the
film's peroration puts it best: "To look life in the face, always to
look life in the face, and to know what it is, to love it for what it
is. At last to know it. To love it for what it is. And then to put it
away."</TE>

<HD>Limits on Drug Firm Incentives Opposed</HD>
<DH>Groups including doctors say federal plan to curtail
promotions could hurt patient care.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merck &amp; Co., Johnson &amp; Johnson, doctors and insurers are among those
protesting proposed limits on drug makers' use of discounts and cash
incentives to encourage the use of their products.</LD>
<LD>   The Department of Health and Human Services has suggested that
routine incentives offered to persuade doctors and insurers to switch
patients to their medicines or include them on lists of preferred
drugs may violate federal kickback laws.</LD>
<LD>   The agency proposed voluntary limits on such promotions in
October.</LD>
<TE>   The drug industry, insurers, pharmacists, biotechnology companies
and wholesalers say the guidelines from the HHS inspector general's
office fail to distinguish between legal and illegal discounts and
other promotions and may increase health-care spending and hurt
patient care.</TE>
<TE>   "The guidance provides little practical instruction on which
practices the government believes should be changed or curtailed and
which practices are viewed more favorably," Patrick Davish, Merck's
senior director of public policy, wrote in a letter to Health and
Human Services Inspector General Janet Rehnquist.</TE>
<TE>   The HHS has said the drug industry promotional practices may drive
up spending by Medicare and Medicaid, the government health insurance
plans for the elderly, disabled and poor.</TE>
<TE>   The American Assn. of Health Plans, whose members include Aetna
Inc., Cigna Corp., PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. and WellPoint
Health Networks Inc., said the rules "could have the unfortunate
effect of increasing costs throughout the health- care system."</TE>
<TE>   The American Medical Assn. called some of the recommendations
vague and asked for more details on whether drug companies would be
allowed to help pay for doctors' educational programs and
conferences.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general's office has collected about 142 letters on
the proposed guidelines as part of the process of developing final
rules on drug-maker incentives and promotions.</TE>

<HD>Farmer Bros. Exec Defends Cash Hoarding</HD>
<DH>CFO tells shareholders the funds are needed for liquidity.
Management defeats disclosure plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For months, management of Farmer Bros. Co. had steadfastly refused to
tell shareholders why it was building a huge cash hoard. Those who
called the Torrance-based coffee roaster and distributor to inquire
would typically get a response as cold as an iced latte.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, though, that changed.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at the annual meeting, Chief Financial Officer John
Simmons offered an 11-page defense of Farmer's management practices,
explaining why the company is hanging on to $300 million in cash and
securities -- an amount that eclipses its $200 million in annual
sales.</LD>
<TE>   "Our cash is our working capital, our business-interruption
insurance -- our lifeline -- and we have always made sure it is
liquid and safe," Simmons told about 100 people gathered at the
company's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   For some stockholders, Simmons' comments didn't go far enough,
however.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, his presentation came after Farmer management
successfully rebuffed a measure on the annual ballot that would have
forced the company to make greater financial disclosure. The plan had
been offered by Franklin Mutual Advisors, which holds nearly 10% of
Farmer stock.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal won about 30% of the shares voted at Thursday's
meeting. Management has voting control over 52% of the company's
stock.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders' Push</TE>
<TE>   Bradley Takahashi, a Franklin vice president who represented the
mutual fund at the meeting, said he would continue to push for more
financial disclosure from the company as long it remains public.</TE>
<TE>   "Farmer Bros. is a legacy, and they want to run it as a private
company," he said. "They can take it private. That's the easiest way
to address the concerns of shareholders. We would really like to have
a discussion with management about that."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Mitchell, who heads Mitchell Partners, a Costa Mesa money
management firm that supported Franklin's effort, said he was pleased
that it received "a significant amount of votes considering
management's stake."</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, management now understands the issues and concerns of
the major shareholders and will take some positive actions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Simmons said the company was reluctant to disclose any
information beyond the bare minimum required by the Securities and
Exchange Commission because that would only help Farmer's
competitors. Many of these rivals, he noted, are privately held
companies or divisions of large public concerns such as Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. and thus not obligated to divulge much financial
information.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Simmons did offer a rare peek into management's
thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Coffee is a commodity business, he explained, subject to wide
fluctuations in pricing. Having a pile of cash allows Farmer to
survive droughts, freezes and other climatic disasters that affect
prices, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The company also recently launched a two-year, $5-million overhaul
of its computer systems. When the project is completed, Simmons said
Farmer may look for acquisitions, which could be accomplished without
borrowings, thanks to its cash cushion.</TE>
<TE>   "Tomorrow may bring a crisis or opportunity that would dissipate
cash rapidly, and we intend to have the liquidity to meet that crisis
or seize that opportunity," Simmons said.</TE>
<TE>   Independent Director</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Thursday, Farmer gave its dissident shareholders a
post-Christmas present in the form of a pledge to add an independent
director to the insular company's board.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1912, Farmer has faced criticism in recent months for
its lack of independent board members.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons acknowledged the concerns and said the company had begun
the search for an independent director and was committed to meeting
new federal regulations in that area.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research
Center said only one of Farmer Bros.' six directors -- Glendale
accountant John Merrell -- met its standards of independence.</TE>
<TE>   And Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises more than
950 institutional and corporate clients on corporate governance
issues, told shareholders to withhold votes for Roy F. Farmer, the
company's 86-year-old chairman and chief executive; his son Roy E.
Farmer, who is president of the company; and Guenter Berger, Farmer's
vice president of production.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockville, Md., advisory service made its recommendations as a
protest over the lack of an independent nominating committee for the
board but had no expectations of unseating the incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there were no opposing nominees. All six directors were
reelected by wide margins at the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Roy F. Farmer, who has missed at least half of the company's board
meetings over the last two years, is recovering from surgery and did
not attend the shareholders meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons said shareholders had little to complain about considering
that the company is profitable and debt-free.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Bros. shares fell $6.10 to close at $312.25 on Nasdaq on
Thursday. They have risen 18% this year.</TE>

<HD>GM Planning to Beef Up Production of Hybrids</HD>
<DH>The world's largest automaker hopes to manufacture 1
million of the vehicles by 2007. It also is pushing sales to the
military.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. plans to offer hybrid gasoline-electric engines
in up to 1 million of its most popular cars, pickup trucks and sport
utility vehicles by 2007 -- with California expected to be the
biggest market.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest automaker also is talking to the Pentagon
about building tens of thousands more hybrid vehicles, according to
sources who have been briefed about the programs. The armed forces
have "a strong appetite for this," especially because using hybrids
in regions like the Middle East would greatly reduce the amount of
fuel that military units would have to transport with them in combat
areas, said one source.</LD>
<LD>   GM is expected to sell hybrid engines as soon as next year in the
company's best-selling lines -- Chevrolet cars and trucks, Cadillac,
Saturn and GMC trucks, sources said.</LD>
<TE>   California is the largest market for low-emission vehicles.
Because of its severe air quality problems, California is the only
state allowed to set up emission standards that are tougher than
those of the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   The state's stricter rules have forced automakers to invest in
expensive pollution-control technologies and sparked wider research
into vehicles that run on alternative fuels.</TE>
<TE>   Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. are the only automakers
offering hybrid vehicles in the U.S. Hybrids increase fuel economy by
using electric motors to boost the output of a small gasoline engine.
The two companies have sold about 25,000 hybrids this year.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts see GM's plans as acknowledgment that Toyota and
Honda have struck a chord with American consumers concerned about
dependence on foreign oil.</TE>
<TE>   The five-seat Toyota Prius and Honda Civic hybrids and two-seat
Honda Insight all have EPA fuel economy ratings of 45 miles per
gallon or better.</TE>
<TE>   GM has spent billions on alternate fuel technologies and sees
hybrid motors as a bridge between conventional internal combustion
engines and the emission-free fuel cell that use hydrogen to produce
electricity to power a car's electric motor.</TE>
<TE>   GM plans to offer three types of hybrids, sources said, and it
will seek federal tax incentives -- Toyota and Honda hybrids each
qualify for a $2,000 federal tax deduction, as well as state and
local incentives -- to help offset the higher cost of the systems.</TE>
<TE>   GM's talks with the Pentagon are especially important because
military vehicles would use GM's gasoline-to-hydrogen fuel cell
system, as well as the less esoteric gas-electric hybrid systems,
providing one of the first widespread uses of fuel cells in passenger
and work vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   GM's discussions with the Defense Department also involve
establishment of hydrogen manufacturing and fueling stations on
military bases.</TE>

<HD>Hooters Owner Buys N.C. Charter Carrier</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.</DL>
<LD>The owner of the Hooters restaurant chain, dashed in an earlier
attempt to buy an airline, has acquired a small North Carolina
carrier with hopes of launching Hooters Air.</LD>
<LD>   Hooters of America Inc. Chairman Robert H. Brooks said Thursday he
had bought Pace Airlines, a division of Piedmont Hawthorne Aviation.</LD>
<LD>   The airline has 17 Boeing jets and 350 employees, most based near
Piedmont's headquarters in Winston-Salem, N.C. Pace specializes in
corporate shuttles and business jets, catering to sports teams, VIP
business travelers and vacation charters.</LD>
<TE>   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "We would hope to stay in Winston-Salem, pending the outcome of
negotiations," Darrell Richardson, president and chief executive of
Pace, told the Winston-Salem Journal.</TE>
<TE>   Messages left with Pace Airlines and Hooters of America by the
Associated Press were not immediately returned Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In a news release, Brooks said he plans to establish a charter air
service called Hooters Air and would provide leisure travel service
for the golf industry to Myrtle Beach, S.C. Brooks also has a home
there.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Vanguard Airlines Inc. rejected Brooks' offer to buy
the assets of the failed Kansas City, Mo., company.</TE>
<TE>   "While things did not work out with Vanguard, I learned through my
due diligence efforts that the charter service segment is a healthier
business arena and much better suited for extending the Hooters
brand," Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   Hooters was founded in 1983, and Brooks and a group of Atlanta
investors bought expansion and franchise rights for the chain in
1984. Brooks eventually bought majority control and became chairman
in March.</TE>

<HD>Sharper Image Pierces Through Retail Gloom</HD>
<DH>The specialty chain says sales are strong this month. But
Wal-Mart, others offer bad news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sharper Image Corp. is looking, well, sharper than most of the retail
pack.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based purveyor of unusual gifts and gadgets said
Thursday that December same-store sales rose a healthy 7% through
Christmas Eve, reaching the high end of its expectations. The chain
store operator also said Internet sales exceeded its projections,
jumping 68%.</LD>
<LD>   Investors were pleased. Sharper Image shares jumped 18%, or $2.79,
to $18.54 in Nasdaq trading Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   The company's announcement came amid more signs that Chistmas
hasn't been very merry for most of the rest of the retail sector.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. on Thursday trimmed its
December sales forecast for the second time in recent weeks. The
dreary news from the world's largest retailer was, for some, a bit
like learning there's no Santa Claus.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the epitome in retailing," said Matthew Kaufler of
Clover Capital Management. "If they are feeling it, it's a pretty
tough environment."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Wan, Sharper Image's president, figures that her company is
"bucking the trend" because of its unusual product mix. Among its
hottest sellers: noiseless air purifiers, personal robots and
"electronic locaters" to help people find their keys and other lost
items.</TE>
<TE>   Counting both new outlets as well as stores open for at least a
year, monthly sales at Sharper Image through Dec. 24 were a record
$111 million, up 28% over the same period in 2001. A strong close to
the year is particularly important for the company because it is so
reliant on Christmas business; it generally does not turn a profit
until its fiscal fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Sharper Image earned $1.3 million after posting losses
in each of its first three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Sharper Image has 127 locations nationwide, including 25 in
California.</TE>
<TE>   At the Sharper Image store in Newport Beach on Thursday, Ethan
Wayne was back for some post-Christmas browsing. The semiretired
40-year-old said he had purchased nearly all of his holiday gifts at
the store, including three scooters, four alarm clocks and five
manicure kits. Now, he was looking to buy something for himself,
testing a massage chair with a price tag of just under $3,000. "I'll
probably get one eventually," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For many retailers that sell more prosaic goods, meanwhile, it was
a limp to the finish of what has been a brutal holiday selling race.
Consider:</TE>
<TE>   * In trimming its sales forecast, Wal-Mart conceded that improved
business in the days before Christmas was "too late and too little"
to allow the Bentonville, Ark.-based discounter to make its target
for the five-week period ending Jan 3.</TE>
<TE>   * The National Retail Federation and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi said
Thursday that 55% of the retailers they polled expect the industry's
fourth-quarter profits to be weaker -- or much weaker -- than last
year's. The slump was attributed in part to the inability of stores
to raise prices, a fact confirmed by the "50% off" signs
proliferating at just about every mall in America.</TE>
<TE>   * Despite the aggressive discounting, U.S. retail sales fell 11%
between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared with last year, according
to an estimate released by ShopperTrak RCT.</TE>
<TE>   It is debatable, however, whether the two periods are directly
comparable, given that the span between holidays had six fewer days
this year. Some experts say people will have spent whatever they were
going to, whatever the length of the season, while others believe
sales have been hurt with fewer days to buy.</TE>
<TE>   With the scent of bargains still lingering in the air, Southland
shoppers returned to stores Thursday, eager to cash in gift cards or
to find fresh markdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles resident Maxine Young, 70, shopped with her daughter
at Fashion Island in Newport Beach, looking for shoes, Christmas tree
ornaments and other goodies.</TE>
<TE>   "We pick up a sweater here, a pair of pants there," said Young, a
retired education administrator. "You have to be open to the quest."</TE>
<TE>   But some were disappointed, saying pre-Christmas prices were as
low or even lower than what they found in stores Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   After buying a man's suit at Robinsons-May before Christmas for
$200, attorney Cori Ferrentino found that she would have to pay more
to get another one the day after the holiday. The Newport Beach store
was offering the same suit for $450, while throwing in a second suit
at no charge, the 38-year-old Costa Mesa resident said.</TE>
<TE>   At South Coast Plaza, well-heeled shoppers got some breaks as
certain high-end stores that eschew pre-Christmas sales marked down
merchandise while workers scraped fake snow off the windows. Jeweler
Black, Starr &amp; Frost, for example, cut the price of a $30,000 diamond
ring in half.</TE>

<HD>New Jobless Benefit Claims Fall by 60,000</HD>
<DH>The steepest weekly drop since October 2001 provides hope
of a recovering economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jube Shiver Jr.</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Defying a sluggish economy, new claims for jobless benefits showed
their sharpest one-week decline in more than a year, the Labor
Department reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   New claims for state unemployment benefits -- an indication of the
severity of worker layoffs -- fell by a seasonally adjusted 60,000 to
378,000 for the workweek ended Dec. 21 from a revised 438,000 for the
prior period.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second consecutive week in which new jobless claims
dropped and the steepest plunge since October 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The decline was seen as an encouraging -- but not definitive --
sign that the nation's economy may be recovering after a year of
stumbling over lackluster business spending, a slumping stock market
and massive layoffs in the beleaguered telecommunications industry.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers sparked an early market rally, but the Dow Jones
industrial average and Nasdaq both closed down. The Dow fell 15.50
points to 8,432.61, and Nasdaq dipped 4.58 points to 1,367.89.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts cautioned that jobless benefits numbers are too erratic
to read too much into a single week's tally. In particular, the
Thanksgiving-to-Christmas period is often skewed by short work
schedules and bad weather.</TE>
<TE>   "This is unmitigated good news," said Robert Litan, an economist
at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington. "Sixty
thousand is a big number. And it could be a harbinger that we had
stronger growth in the fourth quarter than most forecasters had been
expecting. But I'm not ready to predict that because these are
volatile" reports.</TE>
<TE>   The number of new claims was down more sharply than economists had
forecast, and Labor Department officials ventured no explanation for
the surprising results.</TE>
<TE>   However, experts say weaknesses in the overall job market have
been obscured by transitory government hiring, mostly of airport
security guards and other homeland security staffing.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department's report was not all positive. The agency
noted that its four-week moving average of jobless claims, which
irons out week-to-week fluctuations, rose to 404,500, the highest
mark since the week ended Oct. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the Labor Department reported that the number of people
who continue to draw unemployment benefits fell just 12,000 to 3.46
million in the week ended Dec. 14, signaling that the rate of new
hiring did not increase as dramatically as claims decreased.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Says Plan to Restrict Nonlawyers' Legal Advice Would
Hurt Consumers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission said a plan
to restrict nonlawyers from offering some forms of legal advice would
result in "significant consumer harm."</LD>
<LD>   The American Bar Assn. has proposed a rule that would prevent
nonlawyers from giving advice on situations such as closing real
estate loans and making wills, the Justice Department said. The rule
also might prohibit accountants and bankers from advising their
clients about relevant laws, the government said.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter sent Friday to the largest U.S. lawyers' organization,
the department said the rule would hurt consumers by reducing their
choices in getting help and forcing them to pay higher prices for
legal information.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no evidence before the ABA of which we are aware that
consumers are hurt by this competition and there is substantial
evidence that they benefit from it," wrote Acting Assistant Atty.
Gen. R. Hewitt Pate.</TE>
<TE>   The public benefits from competition between lawyers and
nonlawyers in areas such as tenant rights and income tax preparation,
the Justice Department said.</TE>
<TE>   An ABA task force plans to hold meetings next year on the proposed
rule, which would broaden the activities considered legal practice. A
person practicing law must be licensed to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The rule also would put restrictions on software allowing
consumers to write up their own legal papers, the Justice Department
said.</TE>

<HD>Hacker's Internet Cuffs Coming Off</HD>
<DH>Felon Kevin Mitnick's probation ends Jan. 20. He says he's
starting a computer security firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>A man the federal government once labeled "the most wanted computer
criminal in U.S. history" can soon resume surfing the Internet and
using electronic devices he was forced to give up after his
conviction.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Mitnick, 39, of Thousand Oaks served five years in federal
prison for stealing software and altering data at Motorola Inc.,
Novell Inc., Nokia Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc. and USC. Prosecutors
accused him of causing tens of millions of dollars in damage to
corporate computer networks.</LD>
<LD>   Mitnick was freed in January 2000. The terms of his probation,
which expires Jan. 20, require that he get government permission
before using computers, software, modems or any devices that connect
to the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   Mitnick has been allowed to use a cell phone for two years and
received permission this year to type a manuscript on a computer not
connected to the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "Not being allowed to use the Internet is kind of like not being
allowed to use a telephone," Mitnick said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Mitnick said he was starting a firm to help companies protect
themselves from computer attacks. He said the end of his probation
would allow him to do hands-on work.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Painter, deputy chief of the Justice Department's
computer crime section and the former assistant U.S. attorney who
prosecuted Mitnick, said that once Mitnick's probation is over, he
would not be subject to special surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   Mitnick led the FBI on a three-year manhunt that ended in 1995,
when agents arrested him in Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Mitnick also can soon return to another device he missed: the ham
radio.</TE>
<TE>   He applied to renew his ham radio license in 1999 while in prison.
The Federal Communications Commission ordered a hearing, noting that
Mitnick was once "the most wanted computer criminal in U.S. history."</TE>
<TE>   FCC Administrative Law Judge Richard Sippel granted the license in
a ruling made public Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He started hacking as an inquisitive teenager and wound up a
disgraced felon," Sippel wrote. "There is reliable evidence that Mr.
Mitnick has focused on becoming an honest, productive citizen."</TE>
<TE>   Mitnick, who began using ham radios when he was 13, said it cost
him more than $16,000 in legal expenses to renew his license. Typical
renewals are free.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most expensive amateur radio license in the world,"
Mitnick said.</TE>

<HD>Mortgage Rates Drop to Lowest Level on Record</HD>
<DH>Freddie Mac says 30-year fixed loans fell this week to an
average of 5.93% and one-year ARMs to 4.01%, fueling boom in the
housing sector.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Continuing their record-breaking streak, mortgage rates dipped to
their lowest levels on record, mortgage company Freddie Mac said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   For the week ending today, Freddie Mac said 30-year fixed mortgage
rates fell to a record average of 5.93% from 6.03%. The 30-year rate
has remained below the key 7% level since mid-April and fell to its
previous lowest level in the week that ended Nov. 15.</LD>
<LD>   "2002 was an amazing year for the housing sector," said Frank
Nothaft, Freddie Mac's chief economist, adding that the 30-year rate
averaged 6.5% this year, the lowest annual average in more than 31
years.</LD>
<TE>   "The outlook for the future is rosy as we start out the new year
with mortgage rates at or below 6% across the nation," he added.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of these record lows, U.S. mortgage applications fell
7.8% last week but remained at levels above last year's average,
according to the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   Mortgage rates are expected to plateau next year because the
Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut its key interest rates further as
the economy is showing signs of a recovery, in part fueled by the
strong housing market.</TE>
<TE>   Record low rates were "the primary factor that led to an
incredible amount of home building, home sales and refinancing, all
of which helped keep the economy from another recession," Nothaft
said.</TE>
<TE>   Freddie Mac said rates on 15-year mortgages inched lower to 5.32%
from 5.42% a week ago, matching the record low attained in the week
ended Nov. 15.</TE>
<TE>   One-year adjustable rate mortgages also fell to an all-time low of
4.01% from 4.07%.</TE>
<TE>   Freddie Mac said lenders charged an average of 0.6% in fees and
points on 30- and 15-year mortgages as well as on ARMs, unchanged
from last week.</TE>
<TE>   Freddie Mac is a corporation chartered by Congress that buys
mortgages from lenders and packages them into securities for
investors or holds them in its own portfolio.</TE>

<HD>Municipal Power Struggle</HD>
<DH>Electricity consultants are telling cities that they can
break free of the big utilities, which are fighting back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The weather was sizzling and the electric bills sizable in August
when Tulare City Manager Kevin Northcraft opened a letter promising a
tonic for the Central Valley town's energy woes.</LD>
<LD>   If Tulare were to form a municipal utility, it could lower the
power tab for businesses and residents alike, went the pitch from EES
Consulting Inc., a mid-size engineering firm in Kirkland, Wash.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't just listen to the daily complaints of your friends and
neighbors. Join the growing list of California communities that are
trying to do something about high electric costs," said the missive
from the president of EES, Gary Saleba.</LD>
<TE>   In classic calamity-breeds-opportunity fashion, EES Consulting and
a small group of other firms have turned the wreckage of California's
ill-fated energy deregulation experiment into something of a cottage
industry, peddling their expertise to communities that might want to
break free of the large investor-owned utilities that have always
brought them electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other municipal-electricity consultants working in
California are Henwood Energy Services of Sacramento, R.W. Beck of
Seattle and Navigant Consulting of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, EES Consulting has played a prominent role in the
three major efforts in the Southland over the last 18 months to
create government-owned electric utilities, including a recent bid by
Corona to seize Southern California Edison Co. facilities using its
power of eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   Edison and other utilities are fighting back. They say EES
exaggerates the benefit -- and low-balls the cost -- of starting up a
municipal utility. And in at least two cities that have hired EES,
public officials say they were dissatisfied with the company's work.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the counterattacks have helped stall or defeat most of the
attempts to take away hundreds of millions of dollars of annual
revenue that come from distributing electrons to customers. But EES
officials stand by their work, saying they fulfill a legitimate need
to help cities find a way to break free of the grip of the utilities.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people," like those in Corona, who are "just
fed up with what's gone on over the last five years, who decided to
take their future into their own hands -- and I say, more power to
them," Saleba asserted. "I get calls from other cities weekly, if not
daily."</TE>
<TE>   Higher electricity rates are one of the hangovers from
California's energy crisis of 2000 and 2001, afflicting the customers
of Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and San
Diego Gas &amp; Electric. It is a headache not visited on customers of
municipal utilities in the state -- including those of the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power -- who sailed through the
turmoil with fewer problems.</TE>
<TE>   In Corona, which announced plans in October to take over Edison's
distribution system, EES Consulting has projected that the city would
save 15% on electricity rates under a municipal utility. EES also
made similar savings projections for a six-city coalition in the
Coachella Valley and for the San Diego County city of San Marcos.</TE>
<TE>   Based near Seattle, the 50-person firm provides a variety of
energy-related consulting expertise, from estimating the value of
power plants to helping groups of customers band together to acquire
natural gas or electricity service.</TE>
<TE>   In San Marcos, the Coachella Valley and Corona, EES Consulting was
hired to forecast the cost of seizing the existing power distribution
systems and the rates a new municipal utility would charge. EES
Consulting landed those jobs through a competitive bidding process.</TE>
<TE>   "EES had the best sales pitch," said Indian Wells City Councilman
Percy Byrd, who headed an electricity study group for the Coachella
Valley cities of Indian Wells, Palm Springs, Palm Desert, Rancho
Mirage, Cathedral City and Desert Hot Springs. "They had the best
track record of putting together the best report."</TE>
<TE>   But Edison, which faced EES Consulting in Corona and the Coachella
Valley, and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, which came up against the
company in San Marcos, are sharply critical of EES' studies.</TE>
<TE>   The reports were riddled with errors, utility representatives
contend, including underestimating the value of existing facilities,
inflating potential savings and presenting only a best-case
projection of costs.</TE>
<TE>   In San Marcos, which wanted a municipal utility to serve newly
developed parts of town, "we felt the report was very optimistic,"
said Frank Urtasun, a San Diego Gas &amp; Electric regional public
affairs manager. SDG&amp;E put out its own study that predicted rates
would not fall 23% to 36%, as EES Consulting had said, but instead
would increase.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to educate the City Council that the energy crisis was
about generation and not about the delivery system," Urtasun said.
"This is a very complicated industry with a lot of risk and
uncertainty and a regulatory arena that changes very often."</TE>
<TE>   In Edison territory, the choreography was similar.</TE>
<TE>   Corona marks "the second time we have seen their work, and it's
the second time a community has been given a recommendation to move
ahead with an expensive taking of a utility distribution system,"
Edison spokesman Charley Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Studies Criticized</TE>
<TE>   Yet it's not just the utilities that have been critical of EES'
studies at times.</TE>
<TE>   Former San Marcos City Councilman Mark Rozmus, for example, said
he initially supported the creation of a municipal utility and the
city's investment in a 250-megawatt power plant in Burbank. But
Rozmus, a certified public accountant, became dismayed when EES
unexpectedly revised the projected savings figures downward on the
eve of a key City Council vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that they were fully capable of giving us
information that we could rely on to spend the public's money
reasonably," Rozmus said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, San Marcos scrapped the muni concept after several
legislative roadblocks, including potentially steep exit fees to
leave SDG&amp;E's system, stymied the city's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   In Palm Springs, meanwhile, contentious letters were exchanged by
Saleba and Assistant City Manager Troy Butzlaff when the municipality
hired another consulting firm to verify certain estimates by EES.
Edison, which paid for the new study, said EES had inflated potential
savings in the Coachella Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Saleba refused a request by Palm Springs officials to provide the
data that went into the EES analysis, maintaining that the city was
on a witch hunt. The new study by Henwood Energy Services said EES'
estimate of a distribution rate used to determine savings was too
high, and Edison's estimate was too low.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Edison's challenge of the EES report helped sideline
the municipal utility drive in the Coachella Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "All Edison wanted to do was criticize," said Byrd, the Indian
Wells councilman, who praised EES' work. "They looked for an excuse
to pick on one number and then say the whole thing was not valid."</TE>
<TE>   Saleba said he is not surprised that his firm's studies have come
under fire on occasion. "This is a big deal for the utilities," he
said. "There are a lot of Coronas out there.</TE>
<TE>   "My experience is that the incumbent utilities usually have a
standard way they go at this," he added. "You do a study. It looks
like the numbers pencil out. The incumbent utility will immediately
question the numbers in the study ... cast doubt about the economic
feasibility. And then the incumbent will begin their political
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some Corona officials say they are bracing for a possible
recall drive against City Council members, although Edison spokesman
Paul Klein said his company has no plans to launch one. Edison has,
however, vowed to fight the takeover in court.</TE>
<TE>   Foes Are Well-Funded</TE>
<TE>   The opposition to the new municipal utilities is well-funded,
despite the recent financial problems at Pacific Gas &amp; Electric,
which is in bankruptcy proceedings, and at Edison, which plunged into
technical insolvency during the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, PG&amp;E supplied the bulk of the $2.7 million spent
to defeat a November ballot measure that would have authorized San
Francisco to take over power-buying duties for the city, paving the
way for a buyout of the PG&amp;E distribution system there.</TE>
<TE>   Edison officials declined to say how much they have spent battling
the formation of municipal utilities in the Coachella Valley and
Corona. SDG&amp;E also refused to release spending figures for its battle
in San Marcos.</TE>
<TE>   All parties acknowledge that much of the dispute over rate
estimates under a municipal utility stems from a disagreement over
how to value poles, wires, substations and other distribution assets.</TE>
<TE>   EES Consulting bases its estimates on what it would cost to build
the structures today, less depreciation. Utilities prefer to value
their distribution systems on the basis of the original cost, less
depreciation, plus a premium. Utilities contend their method is more
accurate, but it makes the systems more costly to buy.</TE>
<TE>   The clash most likely will be settled in court, but no municipal
utility push has made it that far, with efforts stalled in both San
Marcos and the Coachella Valley.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, all eyes are on Corona, which has filed a
condemnation lawsuit against Edison.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is watching Corona right now because that's going to be
the big show," Saleba said. "How Corona goes will probably dictate
how a lot of other" cities go.</TE>
<TE>   Corona City Manager George Guayante said officials are prepared
for a tough fight, but he is convinced that EES' recommendation makes
sense. "We had a pretty good idea what we were getting into, but we
think the numbers work for us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Tulare, which got one of EES Consulting's letters, the
sales pitch fell flat.</TE>
<TE>   Edison is a major employer in town, providing jobs for more than
100 of Tulare's 40,000 residents at a service center, substation and
an agriculture technology demonstration center, complete with exhibit
hall and dining facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Forming an electric utility "would have been a difficult policy
issue for us to pursue because we are well vested with Edison," said
Northcraft, the city manager. "It seems highly risky, and we have our
hands full already."</TE>

<HD>Credit-Rating Cuts Top Record Set in 2001, Moody's Says</HD>
<DH>The outlook for 2003 is optimistic, as companies are
expected to revamp their accounting and control indebtedness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. credit-rating cuts topped last year's record as a slump in the
energy and telecommunications industries hurt creditworthiness at
companies as diverse as Mirant Corp. and Qwest Communications
International Inc., according to Moody's Investors Service.</LD>
<LD>   Through Dec. 24, there were 647 rating cuts, two more than for all
of last year, said John Lonski, Moody's chief economist. Excluding
wholesale electric power, telecom and technology companies, rating
reductions would have fallen 16% from 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The forecast for creditworthiness is better for 2003, Lonski said,
as companies rework their accounting and keep indebtedness in check.
Ratings help determine the amount of extra yield investors demand to
buy corporate debt rather than Treasuries, with stronger-rated
companies usually paying lower interest rates when they borrow.
Corporate bond risk premiums shrank to five-month lows in December on
optimism that companies' prospects will improve.</LD>
<TE>   "You've had so much borrowing restraint take effect, with
companies managing their debt more conservatively and benefiting from
lower borrowing costs," Lonski said. "If these forecasts for an
improving economy prove to be true, chances are you are going to have
fewer downgrades and more upgrades in 2003."</TE>
<TE>   Ratings increases this year were the scarcest since 1991. Moody's
boosted ratings for 129 borrowers, compared with 219 last year,
Lonski said. Cuts will outpace increases again next year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mirant, Dynegy Inc., El Paso Corp., Qwest and WorldCom Inc. were
among the companies whose ratings were cut in 2002 amid accounting
inquiries and falling profits.</TE>
<TE>   Energy traders faced heightened scrutiny after Enron Corp.'s
bankruptcy filings in December 2001. Many top trading companies left
the business or scaled back after regulatory investigations
contributed to credit-rating cuts. Aquila Inc. quit wholesale trading
in August, and rivals such as El Paso and Williams Cos. reduced their
staffs. The three were among companies stripped of their
investment-grade credit ratings at Moody's in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Companies cut to below investment grade, or "junk," accounted for
about 30% of the quarter's investment-grade rating reductions through
the end of November, Moody's said.</TE>
<TE>   The five increases awarded to investment-grade companies in the
fourth quarter was the lowest quarterly total in Lonski's records,
which date to the start of 1986. The previous low was the six
increases meted out during the fourth quarter of 1987, he said. Bonds
rated below investment grade fared better, with 20 ratings increases
in the fourth quarter, Lonski said.</TE>
<TE>   Risk premiums, or the extra yield offered above Treasuries, as of
Dec. 24 averaged 1.86 percentage points for investment-grade bonds,
down from a decade high of 2.67 percentage points Oct. 10, Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. reported. The average for lower-rated debt shrank to 8.82
percentage points from 11 percentage points.</TE>

<LD>Investors suing Pasadena-based Idealab said Thursday that the
Securities and Exchange Commission has told them it is looking into
the status of the tech incubator's exemption from the Investment
Company Act of 1940.</LD>
<LD>   If Idealab's exemption were rescinded, investors would be entitled
to a full refund of the more than $700 million they put into the
firm, Martin Lybecker, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said.</LD>
<LD>   He said the plaintiffs recently were notified by the SEC that it
began an informal inquiry of Idealab's exemption in June.</LD>
<TE>   An Idealab spokesman said the firm responded to information
requests from the SEC in July and August, adding, "We have no reason
to believe there is any problem." The SEC could not be reached.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PepsiCo Inc. lost a bid to revive a lawsuit that accused rival
Coca-Cola Co., the world's largest soft-drink maker, of violating
antitrust laws by forcing distributors to sell only its drinks to
retailers.</LD>
<LD>   A two-judge appeals panel affirmed U.S. District Judge Loretta
Preska's September 2000 ruling dismissing the lawsuit brought by the
No. 2 soft-drink maker, which claimed that Coca-Cola committed
antitrust violations by barring its independent distributors -- which
supply restaurant and movie theater chains and other food-service
outlets -- from selling Pepsi.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo said the company was
disappointed but planned no further appeals.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Atlanta-based Coca-Cola fell 8 cents to $44.15 on the
New York Stock Exchange. PepsiCo shares, which also trade on the
NYSE, rose 41 cents to $42.41.</TE>

<LD>Delta Air Lines Inc. backed off a plan to charge $100 to leisure
travelers who fly standby on the same day for which they booked
tickets as the struggling airline industry tries to hold on to
customers.</LD>
<LD>   The third-biggest U.S. carrier cut the fee to $25 for most leisure
travelers who show up for a flight other than the one for which
they're booked effective March 1. In September, Delta said it would
charge $100 for passengers wanting to fly standby.</LD>
<LD>   Carriers such as Delta and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines are scaling
back stringent ticket policies put in place in recent months because
customers objected, said David Stempler, president of the Air
Travelers Assn.</LD>

<LD>   ICN, which owns 80% of Ribapharm, obtained a temporary restraining
order Tuesday from the Delaware Chancery Court restricting the board
of Ribapharm from taking actions outside the "ordinary course of
business" pending ICN's removal of five of six Ribapharm directors.</LD>

Ribapharm to clarify ICN's plans regarding the spinoff, as well as a
related tax-sharing arrangement between the two Costa Mesa-based
companies.</LD>

<HD>$80.3-Million Oregon Tobacco Verdict Upheld</HD>
<DH>Decision against Philip Morris marks first time a state
high court has backed punitive damage award in such cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myron Levin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a key West Coast defeat for Big Tobacco, the Oregon Supreme Court
refused to hear Philip Morris Cos.' appeal of an $80.3-million award
to the family of a lung cancer victim, marking the first time a state
high court has upheld a punitive damage verdict in a
smoking-and-health case.</LD>
<LD>   The top U.S. cigarette maker said Thursday that it would seek a
review by the U.S. Supreme Court, though there is no guarantee it
would take the case.</LD>
<LD>   By a 4-2 vote, the Oregon court rejected the appeal, declaring
simply that "the court has considered the petition for review and
orders that it be denied." Though issued Tuesday, the decision was
not publicly announced and did not reach lawyers in the case until
Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the farthest that a punitive damage award in a tobacco
case has gone, and we're talking a very substantial award," said
Richard Daynard, a Northeastern University law professor and director
of the Tobacco Products Liability Project, which promotes lawsuits
against the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris was seeking to overturn the award of damages to the
family of Jesse D. Williams, a Portland school custodian and longtime
Marlboro smoker who died of lung cancer five years ago at age 67.</TE>
<TE>   The 1999 award of about $800,000 in compensatory and $79.5 million
in punitive damages was at the time the largest verdict in favor of
an individual smoker. It has since been surpassed in cases in
California and Oregon, where six major plaintiffs' victories over
tobacco firms are in various stages of appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "We are happy that the courts are doing their job and that Philip
Morris is being slowly cornered -- to the point where they're going
to eventually have to accept accountability for what they've done,"
said William A. Gaylord, a lawyer for the Williams family.</TE>
<TE>   But the plaintiffs are not celebrating, Gaylord added, "because if
anything is predictable, it's that Philip Morris will try to drag
this out further."</TE>
<TE>   William S. Ohlemeyer, vice president and associate general counsel
for Philip Morris, said in a statement that he was "disappointed that
the Oregon Supreme Court sidestepped this case because it involves
legal issues that are critically important."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, he said, the ratio of punitive damages to
compensatory damages in the Williams case -- 97 to 1 -- violated the
principle that punitive awards bear a reasonable relationship to
actual harm suffered by a plaintiff.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups are hoping that a Utah case now before the U.S.
Supreme Court will establish guidelines or even a formula to rein in
punitive damage awards. The case involves a disputed award of $145
million in punitive damages to State Farm auto insurance
policyholders, whose compensatory award was $1 million. Philip Morris
alluded to the State Farm case Thursday in its statement on the
Williams ruling.</TE>
<TE>   After the Williams verdict in March 1999, the trial judge declared
the jury's punitive damage verdict excessive and trimmed it to $32
million.</TE>
<TE>   But in June of this year, the Oregon Court of Appeals ruled that
the trial judge had erred in reining in the jury. "An award that
might be a serious punishment for one defendant could be only a minor
inconvenience for another," the appeals court said.</TE>
<TE>   "We see nothing in a ratio of 97 to 1 that raises our judicial
eyebrows, given the egregious nature of the defendant's conduct as
implicitly determined by the jury," the appeals court found.</TE>
<TE>   It was this ruling that the Oregon Supreme Court declined to
review.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a rise in courtroom defeats for the once-invincible
industry, tobacco companies have yet to pay a dime in punitive
damages and have paid compensatory damages in only one
smoking-and-health case.</TE>
<TE>   Grady Carter, a longtime Florida smoker who contracted lung
cancer, last year received $1.1 million from Brown &amp; Williamson
Tobacco Corp. after the company exhausted its appeals.</TE>

<HD>Unocal Says Profit May Be 33% Below Forecasts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing falling prices for oil and natural gas, Unocal Corp. said
Thursday that its fourth-quarter profit could be as much as 33% lower
than earlier projections.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's second-largest independent oil company said it
expects adjusted earnings of 40 cents to 45 cents a share for the
fourth quarter ending Dec. 30, down from previous company estimates
of 50 cents to 60 cents.</LD>
<LD>   A protracted and disruptive strike by oil workers in Venezuela has
pushed oil and natural gas prices up in recent weeks, but El
Segundo-based Unocal said the average price over the last three
months remained below estimates.</LD>
<TE>   Unocal said its average per-barrel price for crude oil during the
quarter was $28.10, well below the expected price of $29.75. Natural
gas prices also fell below expectations, averaging $3.90 per million
British thermal units instead of earlier estimates of $4.10.</TE>
<TE>   The commodity price fluctuations will reduce adjusted earnings for
the quarter by 11 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal said it shaved another 4 cents off earlier estimates to
account for a noncash charge of $11 million after taxes that was
related to its purchase of Pure Resources Inc. at the end of October.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the acquisition, options for Pure Resources stock were
converted into options for 4.3 million Unocal shares, using Unocal's
stock price at the time of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock price has risen by more than $4 a share since
then, triggering the expected compensation expense charge to reflect
the increased value of the options, Unocal said.</TE>
<TE>   The company said its fourth-quarter net income will be reduced by
the commodity prices and stock-option items, and will further be cut
by the cost of additional environmental cleanup at various sites. The
new expenses boost Unocal's earlier cost estimates and will cut an
additional 10 cents a share from the company's fourth-quarter net
profit, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal reported the lowered estimate after the market closed. Its
shares Thursday closed at $31.65, down 27 cents in New York Stock
Exchange trading.</TE>

<HD>AT&amp;T Wireless Cuts Cities in 3G Rollout</HD>
<DH>Demand uncertainties will limit the 2004 debut of the
service, which will offer high-speed Web access in four markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc., skittish about customer demand, on
Thursday drastically scaled back the rollout of its next-generation
mobile phone service.</LD>
<LD>   The service, which would give cell phone users high-speed Internet
access, will launch at the end of 2004, half a year later than
previously planned. And it will debut in just four cities -- San
Diego, San Francisco, Dallas and Seattle -- instead of 13 as
originally proposed.</LD>
<LD>   The new plan "will allow the company to cover some of the most
promising U.S. markets while maintaining a prudent level of capital
expenditures," AT&amp;T said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said Thursday's announcement was not surprising, given
how reluctant U.S. consumers have been to use their cell phones for
anything other than making calls.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, corporations have been unwilling to sign up for
costly new services in a sluggish economy.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of customer interest has led many wireless carriers to
put off upgrading their networks to handle high-speed data transfers.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons for the delay is that demand has been
basically underwhelming," said Don Carros, senior research analyst
for Meta Group, a technology consulting firm based in Stamford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Cell phone users today can surf the Internet and get e-mail, but
the connections are slow and the experience is hampered by the small
screen size on a typical handset, Carros noted.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T's next-generation service, called 3G because it is considered
third-generation cell phone technology, would let consumers use more
devices to access the Internet at roughly twice the speed of an
average dial-up connection.</TE>
<TE>   Still, another reason that cell phone Internet service has been
slow to catch on is that it has to compete with WiFi, a technology
that lets laptops wirelessly connect at speeds five times faster than
3G service. Offered at some airports, hotels and cafes, WiFi has
become a popular way to access the Internet on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with such obstacles, AT&amp;T Wireless said it will form a
committee to gauge how quickly it will expand its 3G service.</TE>
<TE>   "Our technology committee will be assessing future markets so the
rollout is determined more in alignment with market demands," said
David Caouette, a spokesman for the Redmond, Wash., company.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Wireless, which was spun off from AT&amp;T Corp. in 2001,
originally announced its 3G plans in 2000. At the time, Tokyo-based
NTT DoCoMo Inc. paid $10 billion for a 16% stake in the No. 3
wireless carrier.</TE>
<TE>   DoCoMo is the largest mobile phone company in Japan, where
consumers have demonstrated more willingness to use their phones for
e-mail and Internet surfing.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Wireless shares fell 13 cents to $6.33 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Investors Take a Holiday as Shares Fall on Worries</HD>
<DH>Retail woes, a rise in oil prices and more war jitters
spark an afternoon sell-off that reverses early gains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors spooked by hostilities in Iraq and a steep rise in oil
prices sent stocks lower Thursday in light, post-Christmas trading.</LD>
<LD>   Retailers were pressured after Wal-Mart Stores lowered its
December sales expectations, while the dollar fell against the euro
and gold prices added to their recent gains.</LD>
<LD>   An afternoon sell-off on Wall Street ended a rally sparked by a
government report indicating that new claims for unemployment
benefits were dropping. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed more
than 116 points before reversing direction. By session's end, the Dow
was down 15.50 points, or 0.2%, at 8,432.61. Declines in Amazon.com
and Microsoft helped pull the Nasdaq composite index down 4.58
points, or 0.3%, to 1,367.89. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was off
2.81 points, or 0.3%, at 889.66.</LD>
<TE>   The Russell 2000 index, which tracks the shares of smaller
companies, eked out a small gain, rising 1.28 points, or 0.3%, to
389.40. Small-company stocks often outperform stocks of larger
companies during the last days of the year.</TE>
<TE>   With many trading floors sparsely staffed around Wednesday's
Christmas Day holiday and European markets closed for the day, volume
was the lowest for a full trading day since Aug. 25, 2000, according
to Bloomberg News. Decliners led advancers by 9 to 7 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Investors turned bearish after the U.S. military said warplanes
from the U.S.-British coalition bombed Iraqi military command and
communication targets in southern Iraq. The attack was in retaliation
for the downing of an unmanned American surveillance drone on Monday,
the military said.</TE>
<TE>   The official Iraqi News Agency, quoting a military spokesman,
countered that a mosque had been hit.</TE>
<TE>   The rising tension with Iraq, a major Middle Eastern oil producer,
along with the continued strike in Venezuela sent oil prices higher.
Oil prices for February delivery climbed 52 cents to $32.49, and some
analysts predict the price could hit $35 soon.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices have climbed more than $12, or 60%, this year -- and
more than $5 just in December, strengthening fears that higher energy
costs could stunt fragile economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart said it was cutting its December same-store sales
forecast and now expects sales to rise 2% to 3%, below its earlier
forecasts. Investors apparently anticipated the reduced sales figures
and sent Wal-Mart shares up 6 cents to $49.76. But Federated
Department Stores fell 24 cents to $27.66, and Amazon.com dropped
$1.58 to $20.30, even though the S&amp;P index of retail stocks managed a
slim 0.5% gain.</TE>
<TE>   The decline for Amazon.com came despite the online retailer's
announcement that it finished its "busiest holiday season ever."
Analysts speculated that investors had been rattled by Wal-Mart's
report and so didn't respond positively to Amazon's news.</TE>
<TE>   A Labor Department report showed that new claims for jobless
benefits fell by a seasonally adjusted 60,000 to 378,000 for the
workweek ending Dec. 21. The drop -- the largest decline since Oct.
6, 2001 -- left claims at their lowest level since Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Drug makers Pfizer and Pharmacia fell sharply after an article
in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that the widely used
arthritis drug Celebrex, made by Pharmacia, doesn't protect the
stomach from dangerous bleeding ulcers as much as thought. Pfizer and
Pharmacia co-promote the drug. Pfizer dropped $1.36 to $30.02, while
Pharmacia was down $2.02 to $40.98.</TE>
<TE>   * Microsoft fell 43 cents to $53.39 despite reporting that
shoppers spent a record $10.7 billion in the fourth quarter at its
MSN network of Internet services.</TE>
<TE>   * Amgen dropped 77 cents to $50.68. A federal judge dismissed the
Thousand Oaks-based company's lawsuit against the U.S. government
that sought to stop Medicare from lowering reimbursement for its
Aranesp anemia treatment when used in clinics and doctors' offices.</TE>
<TE>   * Gold closed higher on war fears, but it failed to push through
$350 an ounce. Near-term gold futures rose $1.90 to $348.70 in New
York trading.</TE>
<TE>   * The dollar slipped to a new three-year low against the euro in
trading thinned by closed European markets.</TE>

<HD>Negative Fund Flow Foreseen for '02</HD>
<DH>For the first 11 months of the year, outflows exceed
inflows by $19.9 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For U.S. mutual funds, 2002 is shaping up as the first calendar year
since 1988 that withdrawals from stock funds exceed purchases, a fund
industry trade group said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. stock mutual funds took in a net $6.5 billion in November,
reversing a five-month stretch when outflows exceeded inflows, the
Investment Company Institute reported. The return to positive flows
came as the U.S. stock market posted solid gains in November for the
second consecutive month.</LD>
<LD>   For the first 11 months of 2002, stock funds had net outflows of
$19.9 billion, according to the ICI. In the same period in 2001,
stock funds posted inflows of $29.1 billion.</LD>
<TE>   December could see a return to outflows for stock funds.
TrimTabs.com, a Santa Rosa, Calif., data firm, estimated the current
month will see outflows of $5.2 billion, based on a projection of
activity through Dec. 23.</TE>
<TE>   At that rate, stock mutual funds will post negative money flows
for the year, the first time since investors started pulling money
out of stock funds after the October 1987 crash.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have yanked money out of stock funds as major market
indexes tumbled during the first half of the year, and took another
steep dive in September and early October. Through Thursday, the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was down 22.5% for the year and was
headed for its third-straight losing year.</TE>
<TE>   Although investors withdrew more from stock funds than they put in
this year, bond funds are generating record sales.</TE>
<TE>   Bond funds took in a net $7.7 billion in November, the ICI said.
For the year through November, bond funds have seen inflows of more
than $133 billion. The previous record for net flows into bond funds
was $102.6 billion in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   In November, investors added a net $7.9 billion to taxable bond
funds while they withdrew a net $164 million from municipal bond
funds.</TE>
<TE>   Money market funds had inflows of $127.6 billion in November,
reflecting activity by institutions. Money market funds sold
primarily to individuals had outflows of $7.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Financial Research Corp., a Boston research and data firm,
calculated that American Funds was the best-selling fund group in
November, with $3.2 billion of net inflows. The company's Growth Fund
of America led all stock and bond funds with net sales of $647
million.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach-based Pimco Total Return Fund, which invests in
fixed income securities, was runner-up with monthly sales of $616
million, FRC said. For the year to date, Pimco Total Return was the
bestseller with $13.6 billion in net inflows.</TE>
<TE>   At Fidelity Investments, the largest U.S. fund company, a
spokesman said its major asset classes have all generated inflows
this month. In November, Fidelity had inflows of $1.5 billion for its
equity funds, $700 million for its bond funds, and $4.6 billion for
money market funds.</TE>
<TE>   Industrywide, stock fund portfolio managers bought a net $1.2
billion of stocks in November, compared with sales of $13.3 billion
in October, according to the ICI data. Cash levels at stock funds
were 5% of assets in November, compared with 5.1% in October and 5.6%
a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Assets of stock funds rose 6% to $2.82 trillion. Assets of funds
of all types, including money market funds, rose by 5% to $6.56
trillion.</TE>
<TE>   The ICI data is based on reports of sales activity from most of
the fund industry. The ICI figures differed from those of several
data firms that have estimated inflows in November.</TE>

<HD>A Fight for Freedom of Speech</HD>
<DH>Dissent doesn't mean a lack of patriotism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Foner and Glenda Gilmore</AU>
<BD>Eric Foner is a professor of history at Columbia
University. Glenda Gilmore is a professor of history at Yale
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We are two of the professors to whom Daniel Pipes refers when he
asks: "Why do American academics so often despise their own country
while finding excuses for repressive and dangerous regimes?"</LD>
<LD>   Pipes, a self-appointed arbiter of acceptable speech and founder
of Campus Watch, recently included us in a list of six "Professors
Who Hate America" in a New York publication. Using us as examples of
professors who relentlessly oppose their own government, he called
for "outsiders" (alumni, state legislators, parents of students and
others) to "take steps to ... establish standards for media
statements by faculty."</LD>
<LD>   If Pipes were simply displaying a profound misunderstanding of
academic freedom, there would be no cause for alarm. But his screed
is symptomatic of a broader trend among conservative commentators,
who since Sept. 11 have increasingly equated criticism of the Bush
administration with lack of patriotism.</LD>
<TE>   William J. Bennett, co-founder of the conservative think tank
Empower America, claims in his recent book "Why We Fight" that
scholars with whom he disagrees "sow widespread and debilitating
confusion" and "weaken the country's resolve." The American Council
of Trustees and Alumni, an organization founded in 1995 by Lynne
Cheney, wife of Vice President Dick Cheney, that calls on those
groups to take a more "active" role in determining what happens on
campuses, chastised professors who fail to teach the "truth" that
civilization itself "is best exemplified in the West and indeed in
America."</TE>
<TE>   Pipes' call for "outsiders" to police the statements of faculty
conjures up memories of World War I and the McCarthy era, when
critics of the government were jailed and institutions of higher
learning dismissed antiwar or "subversive" professors. Historians
today consider such episodes shameful anomalies in the history of
civil liberties in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In equating opposition to government policies with hatred of our
country, Pipes displays a deep hostility to the essence of a
democratic polity: the right to dissent.</TE>
<TE>   What was our sin that unleashed this assault? Our comments
appeared in our respective universities' student newspapers opposing
the Bush administration's assertion of the right to launch a
preemptive war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The same position was voiced by numerous public figures, including
members of the first Bush administration, former President Carter and
members of Congress. It is the viewpoint of virtually every country
in the world, including most of the longtime allies of the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of us offered any "excuse for dangerous and repressive
regimes." It is one thing to deem a regime repressive, quite another
to believe that the United States has the right to assume the
unilateral role of global policeman.</TE>
<TE>   There is little chance that Columbia or Yale, where we teach,
would heed the call to allow "outsiders" to dictate what opinions
faculty may voice. The danger is that institutions less financially
secure and more dependent on legislatures may bend to this gathering
threat to freedom of speech.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Pipes</AU>
<BD>Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum,
writes a weekly column for the New York Post, where a version of this
article appeared.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American universities have turned into hotbeds of opposition, and
it's time to take them back.</LD>
<LD>   Take the issue of Iraq. Americans generally focus on the regime's
brutal behavior toward its own population and the threat it poses to
the outside, while disagreeing over how to respond. Yet ask
professors what the problem is, and they are most likely to reply
that the United States, not Iraq, is the main menace and that oil,
not nukes, is the Bush administration's central concern.</LD>
<LD>   Two professors of history typify this outlook. Eric Foner of
Columbia University asserts that a preemptive war against Iraq would
take us back "to the notion of the rule of the jungle." He
preposterously finds Washington's argument today "exactly the same"
as that used by the Japanese to justify their assault on Pearl
Harbor.</LD>
<TE>   Glenda Gilmore of Yale University sees U.S. imperialism in
Washington's confrontation with Iraq. It's "the first step in Bush's
plan to transform our country into an aggressor nation that cannot
tolerate opposition." She has also stated: "We have met the enemy,
and it is us."</TE>
<TE>   Views like these echo through the campuses, confirming that
universities remain, as they have been since the mid-1960s, the most
radical, adversarial and alienated major institution in American
life.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to suggest censorship; professors have full privileges
to freedom of expression. But it does point to the need to raise some
difficult questions:</TE>
<TE>   * Why do American academics so readily see their own country as
the problem?</TE>
<TE>   * Why do universities hire people who relentlessly apologize for
U.S. enemies?</TE>
<TE>   * Why do professors consistently misunderstand the most important
challenges facing the country, such as the Vietnam War, the Cold War,
the Persian Gulf War and now the war on terror?</TE>
<TE>   * What long-term impact does a radicalized and repressive
university atmosphere have on students?</TE>
<TE>   The country needs its universities to become more mature,
responsible and patriotic. To achieve this change means taking the
wayward academy back from the faculty and administrators who now run
it.</TE>
<TE>   It's important to remember that universities, built over decades
and even centuries, do not belong -- legally, financially or morally
-- to the employees who happen to staff them. The latter do not have
a right to hijack these vital institutions out of the mainstream of
American life.</TE>
<TE>   Outside stakeholders -- board members, alumni, parents of students
and, in the case of state institutions, state legislators -- need to
start worrying more about politics than about football.</TE>
<TE>   They must take steps to re-create a politically balanced
environment, as it was before the 1960s, in which sound scholarship
and sound teaching can again take place.</TE>

<HD>Nuclear Pact Is All Bark and No Bite</HD>
<DH>Enforcement of nonproliferation can't be done without
creating other dangers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bennett Ramberg</AU>
<BD>Bennett Ramberg served in the State Department's Bureau
of Politico Military Affairs from 1989 to 1990 and is the author of
several books on international strategic issues.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is more at stake in the world's response to the nuclear weapons
ambitions of Iraq, Iran and North Korea than the nuclear future of
these countries alone. At risk is the legal bulwark against nuclear
proliferation in general: the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.</LD>
<LD>   Current events put this treaty in jeopardy not simply because of
the actions of these three "violators" but also because the options
available to defeat them are so onerous.</LD>
<LD>   With more than 180 parties, the nonproliferation treaty is one of
the most widely adhered to international agreements. Though the
agreement allows for International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring,
it lacks a compliance mechanism.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, the international community is at a loss on how to
respond when violations occur. There appear to be five options, all
of which challenge the future of this important treaty. They are
diplomatic and economic pressure, nuclear containment, attacks on
nuclear facilities, regime change and uncontested proliferation.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomatic pressure, coupled with economic sanctions, has been
tried and found wanting. They have failed to move the violators.
Economic incentives under the 1994 Agreed Framework between
Washington and Pyongyang also failed.</TE>
<TE>   In fairness, diplomacy can be frustratingly slow. In time,
arguably, it may still succeed. But its track record provides little
confidence. Rather, the violators have used diplomacy simply to buy
time to pursue their nuclear ambitions. Purported nonproliferation
allies also used the time to abet the violators. Pakistan and China
helped North Korea, Russia assisted Iran, and German companies
conducted nuclear business with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear containment is a second option. This strategy would
concede the nuclearization of the violators. In response, it would
resurrect the Cold War strategy of making U.S. nuclear weapons more
visible. This would include the reintroduction of American nuclear
bombs into South Korea and placement in Gulf states. However, we
ought not place too much confidence in this course of action.
Consider: During the superpower era, nuclear crises over Berlin, Cuba
and the Middle East nearly resulted in the nuclear catastrophe
nuclear deterrence sought to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Containment generates another risk. Cold War adversaries never
conveyed nuclear weapons to terrorists. The nuclear violators, by
contrast, may be less inhibited.</TE>
<TE>   The third option would be the Israeli approach: bombing nuclear
weapons plants and storage sites. In the 1990s, the Clinton
administration contemplated military action against North Korea's
reactors and reprocessing plants. Reports that the North already has
nuclear weapons may make the option impractical. (This assumes that
Pyongyang has the ability to deliver the weapons, a matter rarely
questioned.) Bombing would prevent North Korea from developing
additional weapons but, at the same time, it would generate
radiological consequences and, perhaps, most ominously, unleash a new
Korean war.</TE>
<TE>   In Iraq, the U.S. is already contemplating destroying all of
Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction, one way or another. Iran poses
a more difficult challenge. It reportedly is building enrichment
facilities and plans to inaugurate its first power reactor by the end
of 2003. Violating safeguards, it could use the reactor to generate
plutonium for its military program. Were the plant bombed after it
went into operation, significant radiological contamination could
spread broadly given the plant's size. This would put the Persian
Gulf oil fields at risk.</TE>
<TE>   Regime change is another option. Peaceful transformation worked in
Belarus, Ukraine and South Africa, all nuclear weapons states. In the
post-Cold War period and at the end of apartheid, successor regimes
abandoned nuclear weapons. Washington's Iraq policy already calls for
regime change, although implementation will require force unless
Saddam Hussein chooses voluntary exile.</TE>
<TE>   Political ferment in Iran points to the possibility of regime
change, although the mullahs probably will hang on for some time to
come. Given its dire economic situation, we should hope that North
Korea collapses much like the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, we cannot
count on it.</TE>
<TE>   There is one final option. We could sit tight and do nothing. In
East Asia, the result could be the nuclearization of Japan and South
Korea. In the Middle East, Arab states might be so motivated. Israel,
in turn, probably would respond by bringing its nuclear capability
out of the closet. This, in turn, could stimulate yet more
proliferation.</TE>
<TE>   The options present a conundrum. Sitting tight and relying on
nuclear containment eviscerate the nonproliferation treaty. Using
diplomacy, working toward peaceful regime change and bombing reactors
preserve the agreement. But diplomacy and regime change largely rely
on a prayer; the last option opens a Pandora's box legitimizing
attacks on power reactors across the globe.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, unless the violators suspend their nuclear ambitions,
their failure to abide by the treaty exposes the significant
noncompliance hole in its formulation. At the same time, preservation
of the treaty is important because its compliance mechanisms are
useful tripwires.</TE>
<TE>   What we have is a difficult situation where we cannot square the
hole. This raises the obvious, disturbing prospect of a more
dangerous nuclear world in the years to come with no sure fix in
sight.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In our passion to perfect and protect our children, are we damaging
something inside them?</LD>
<LD>   As a middle-class parent with obsessive tendencies, it's almost
impossible to resist the urge to sign up your children for classes
that will develop their nascent -- or so far totally hidden --
talents. It's hard not to get on the frantic circuit where you throw
bagels into the back seat of the van as you ferry them to soccer,
ballet, music, art, martial arts, swimming and computer classes.</LD>
<LD>   Then there's the push to spring-load their academic skills, so you
take the baby to sign language lessons or the 4-year-old to a reading
tutor (at $75 an hour). You're doing it because normal neurological
development can be so pokey, and you've read somewhere that these
classes can permanently enhance hand-eye (or foot-eye) coordination
and IQ scores.</LD>
<TE>   If you don't do it, what else are you going to do? As your
children get a little older, all their friends are signed up for
classes and practices, so there is no one left to play with.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, playing doesn't arise spontaneously from classmates
walking home from school and deciding to gather in someone's
backyard. "Play dates" are put together by parents with the kind of
advance notice and attention to appropriate pairings usually reserved
for arranged marriages.</TE>
<TE>   But you have no choice: It's too dangerous to let anyone younger
than a teenager out of your sight, what with bagel-throwing mothers
roaring around the streets and every stranger a potential pederast.</TE>
<TE>   Pounding at you is the uneasy notion that unless you manage it
right, childhood is a series of lost opportunities. If you wait too
long, someone else's daughter will end up being the oboe-playing,
multilingual figure skater who gets into the right college.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps in all our efforts to do it right, we are doing
something deeply wrong. By becoming managers of our children, by
having most of their waking hours mediated by adult instructors, we
are robbing them of some essential purposes of childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Toni Bickart of Teaching Strategies, a Washington, D.C., publisher
of early childhood curricula, says she has seen a dramatic change in
these kids over the last 10 years. Because they spend so little time
on the playground interacting with other children, they simply don't
understand concepts like taking turns. To compensate, teachers are
asking Bickart for lesson plans on how to make friends and use
imagination.</TE>
<TE>   The trend toward structuring young children's lives was documented
in a 1998 University of Michigan study that looked at how children
ages 3 to 11 spent their time and compared it with a similar 1981
survey. The later study showed that participation in organized sports
increased more than 50%. Not surprisingly, free time dropped to 25%
of the children's day, from 40% in 1981. And a recent Washington Post
article described how recess, the once guaranteed block of barely
contained anarchy in a child's day, has been disappearing, replaced
by organized gym time or more hours in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   In pushing out free play, we risk not just damaging social and
imaginative skills but also doing harm to the cognitive skills we are
hoping to boost. New York University psychologist Jerome Bruner talks
about the possible long-term damage done to psyche and intellect by
forcing young brains to master tasks they are not ready for.</TE>
<TE>   He compares the teaching of reading and writing in Hungary and
Britain. The Hungarians wait until their children are 7, and by age
12 they rank near the top of European literacy assessments. The
British, on the other hand, have pushed down reading instruction to
4; their literacy rankings have dropped concomitantly. Let this be a
warning for us against ever-earlier academics and standardized
testing.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, I have not been immune to the pressure. When my
daughter was 5, I signed her up for tap-dancing lessons. At the last
class, I saw the effort on her face as she mastered an astoundingly
tricky routine. When I praised her, she said, "I didn't want to make
my teacher sad. But I don't want to go back."</TE>
<TE>   She didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Then last year, when she was 6, I felt I should sign her up for a
soccer league. She says she likes it fine. But the other day, we had
four of her friends over. The girls found a basket of balls and ran
around the house in a homemade game of dodge ball. That game took
coordination and teamwork, the benefits ascribed to playing soccer.</TE>
<TE>   It also caused the kind of exultant laughter I have never heard on
the soccer field.</TE>

<HD>A Bad Bet for California</HD>
<DH>Lawmakers should resist the temptation to push for a bigger
stake in tribal casino winnings to help balance the budget.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With glittery Las Vegas-style resorts costing as much as $400 million
popping up statewide, California's gambling revenues have topped New
Jersey's, and the business is cutting into Reno's profits. If casinos
are allowed in major urban centers, more compulsive gamblers will
have a chance to pour in more money that might be spent on the
family's rent or groceries.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, even Native American tribes without casinos are
becoming wealthy because of a revenue-sharing program. And tribes'
generous campaign contributions have made them a major political
force.</LD>
<LD>   Tribal casinos also have become a legal nightmare. The
tribes exert their sovereignty. State and local governments counter by
pushing their jurisdiction to regulate public safety and
environmental issues near the casinos. The tribes usually win. Now
some are fighting the state Gambling Control Commission over
interpretation of the compacts that limit the number of slot machines
and set minimal environmental controls on casinos.</LD>
<TE>   The situation may get worse next year when the 60 tribal compacts
signed by Gov. Gray Davis come up for possible renegotiation. The
tribes, which are likely to seek an increase in the 2,000-per-tribe
limit on slot machines, have gone to court to challenge the state's
authority to set any limits on what were once called one-armed
bandits but might now better be termed computerized
cash-confiscators.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts are underway to open casinos in urban areas such as
Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area in spite of Davis' pledge
to have only a moderate increase in casino gambling and none in urban
areas. Davis has at least tried to stop a proposed club in West
Sacramento. The others may be beyond his control.</TE>
<TE>   Casino gambling is nearing a pivotal point as tribes gear up for
the renegotiations. With California suffering a staggering budget
deficit, some lawmakers talk of the state bargaining for a bigger
stake in casino winnings to help balance the budget. The trade-off
almost certainly would be more slot machines and more casinos. That
would no doubt tempt state finance officials scratching for every
dollar, but it's a bad bet for the state of California. Just remember
how the lottery was going to save the public schools.</TE>
<TE>   The voters have decreed that sovereign tribes should be allowed to
run casinos under restrained state control. They did not even hint
that they wanted California to become an eager partner in an industry
that preys on human weakness.</TE>

<LD>Good news for the careful folks who carry a bottle of water around
all the time, even at the office just feet from real faucets. No need
to worry about sudden droughts anymore; they've found more ice on
Mars.</LD>
<LD>   Even from this distance, people have long known that ice dominates
Mars' north pole, whereas dry ice was thought to dominate the red
planet's south pole. Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide, which is not
so good for drinking. Now, thanks to new satellite imaging, Science
magazine reports that there's also regular ice down south, too. What
a relief!</LD>
<LD>   Water is essential to human life as Californians know it. Without
water there would be nothing to wash cars with every week, dirty or
not. Water is essential for boating, water skiing, watching sunsets
and filling fountains left off to conserve power.</LD>
<TE>   Water has also proved important for unnecessarily long showers,
for making cups of tea with British names and for flushing waste into
the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Without a lot of water, at least on paper, California housing
developers can't build overpriced houses without basements to sell to
people who'll run their lawn sprinklers even during rainstorms.</TE>
<TE>   Governments obviously enjoy using water too; during recent rains,
freeway sprinklers blasted thousands of gallons onto already soaked
trees and plants, just to be sure.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, officials have long known the importance of, shall we
say, importing water from elsewhere. But water isn't just for filling
up long cement ditches from once-green valleys far away. Water can be
sold for high prices in little plastic bottles with nickel deposits
and carried around for stylish sipping anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, finding more ice on Mars can seem a so-what development in,
say, Chicago, which has its own lake to drink from and pollute. But
Mars ice should be very big news in Southern California, which knows
water well but little of ice.</TE>
<TE>   Mars ice is very frozen water; temperatures hover at minus 200
degrees. Without Mars ice, spaceships would have to carry many little
plastic water bottles. If water is available there, that could save a
lot of weight -- and bottle deposits. Then, if no one is watching,
maybe Southern California can figure some way to get Mars ice down
here for thawing so, for instance, the Los Angeles River can have
water other than treated sewage again.</TE>
<TE>   See, this is why seemingly distant science news can be so
important locally.</TE>

<HD>Children Lose in Park Feuds</HD>
<DH>Ball fields, school or undeveloped open space? Government
planners should consider the area's greatest needs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone cheered last year when state officials offered to buy two
large but ratty tracts of land downtown and make them parks. In a
city with far too little green space, especially in its urban core,
the 32-acre Cornfield next to Chinatown and the 30-acre Taylor Yard
in Cypress Park will make a big difference.</LD>
<LD>   Community leaders and environmental activists had pried these
properties away from commercial developers in a David-and-Goliath
struggle and then leaned on Gov. Gray Davis to buy them. But once the
state took title, the squabbling began over how to use these old rail
yards.</LD>
<LD>   Many local residents and youth advocates insist that more athletic
fields and sports leagues are the first priority -- and that they
were an implicit part of the deal for these parks. State officials
insist that they made no promises and argue that neighbors also want
space for a quiet stroll through meadows and trees. Moreover, these
officials contend, the mission of the state park service is to
protect natural resources and historic sites, not to operate ball
fields.</LD>
<TE>   Already, the hue and cry from the hundreds of local parents who
have had to schlep their soccer-playing kids to fields across town
has the state entertaining a land swap that would let the city run
sports programs on part of Taylor Yard.</TE>
<TE>   The Cornfield, environmental groups argue, should remain as open
space in part because remnants of the city's original water canal are
buried beneath it. But Chinatown parents desperately want a middle
school on at least part of that site so their children won't have to
ride the bus anymore. Others want space for a cultural museum and a
community center.</TE>
<TE>   State park officials who felt like heroes last year when they
wrote the checks for these garbage-choked lots must feel that no good
deed goes unpunished. This wrestling match will end only when all
parties recognize that no matter how they are developed, these two
properties alone won't fill every community need.</TE>
<TE>   An advisory group representing the neighborhood, the state and
others with an interest will in February make public its
recommendations for the Cornfield and Taylor Yard. State officials,
meanwhile, should take into account the significant open space nearby
in the city's 200-acre Ernest Debs Regional Park and Griffith Park.
Mayor James K. Hahn and other city officials should accelerate their
own plans to add new parks and recreational space.</TE>
<TE>   Until all of that happens, grown-ups will stay locked in a tug of
war over two parks-to-be, with local kids the big losers.</TE>

<LD>How sad that Robert Scheer should be so full of hatred and bitterness
aimed at Dr. Laura Schlessinger (Commentary, Dec. 24). His attack at
a time of sadness in the life of another human says more about the
one who is doing the kicking than the one who is down. We can expect
to be in a similar circumstance of loss one day. We can either
comfort the family remaining or prepare for our own losses. But there
is no call for such angry vituperation.</LD>

<TE>   I hope Scheer is mistaken in assuming Schlessinger "will no doubt
continue as a hot media product and a darling of the religious
conservatives." As recently demonstrated in the Sen. Trent Lott saga,
when an opportunist like Schlessinger is exposed, she should
gracefully retire and contemplate her duplicitous life.</TE>

<TE>   Scheer hits the nail on the head. Daily, Dr. Laura spews venom at
those who choose to have different views or live their lives
differently from hers, flinging invective at liberals, feminists, the
ACLU, teachers, homosexuals, working mothers, most therapists and
Democrats. She harangues listeners to "honor your mother and father"
while her mother lies rotting in her home for two months.</TE>
<TE>   She claims "I am my kid's mom" and bashes working mothers while
she spends the better part of each day doing a radio show, not to
mention writing books, traveling on promotional tours and speaking
engagements. I don't begrudge Dr. Laura her beliefs, just her desire
to impose them on the rest of us.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a psychologist I am often shocked by some of Schlessinger's
advice. Like Scheer and many detractors of her judgmental side, I
share in a degree of contemptuousness toward her. So it is with some
mixture of feelings that I feel compelled to rush to her defense. She
has stated that her mother refused to speak to her and others over 15
years ago. It is quite within the realm of possibility that Dr. Laura
made many attempts to communicate and failed. The person who refuses
to talk has all the power and is usually the person with the
unresolved problem. Rather than being so judgmental with Dr. Laura,
why don't we leave her alone in her grief?</TE>

<LD>Re "Advisors Put Under a Microscope," Dec. 23: It comes as no
surprise that an administration pursuing medieval policies
(subjugation of women, execution of nonviolent offenders) behaves as
the medieval church did toward its scientists. But wait: Aren't these
the same people who are so excited about developing robot drones and
space lasers to fight their holy crusades?</LD>
<LD>   You can't have it both ways; scientific progress depends on the
ability of scientists to work outside the bounds of political and
religious dogma. Surely the Republicans are as aware as I am that
Hitler never developed the atomic bomb due to his rejection of the
"Jewish pseudoscience," Einsteinian physics.</LD>

<LD>Niels Frenzen talks of the INS arresting hundreds of men who
voluntarily appeared at local INS offices and says that the rules
seem to be guided by political rather than security needs
(Commentary, Dec. 24). He never mentions that the men are in the
country illegally and in violation of the law. This is the same law
that professor Frenzen teaches at USC. This type of selective logic
is why so many hold the legal profession in disdain and academia in
disgust. Perhaps legal resources would be better focused on defending
the Constitution rather than on how to circumvent it.</LD>

<LD>I have been more heartened by the editorial series about the critical
needs of L.A. County's Department of Children and Family Services
than almost anything else I have read recently ("L.A.'s Parent of
Last Resort," Dec. 22-24). The series was thoughtful, particular and
concrete in its critique and suggestions. I commend you for treating
the issue seriously, and for not letting the blame fall solely on the
social workers, who I feel often are required, as in a fairy tale, to
knit gold out of straw.</LD>
<LD>   I have deep concern for the children in our county who are
vulnerable and powerless in dealing with the forces that shape their
destinies. I pray that the Board of Supervisors and people with
resources in the county community will be provoked to respond to your
clear call for action.</LD>

<TE>   As a former child welfare social worker and a former foster
parent, I identified keenly with the frustrations you described in
"Fixing Failed Families: Job for Heroes or Fools?" (Dec. 23). I have
long had in mind an alternative plan, designed to intervene before
the breakup of the family unit: a cadre of residential role models.
These would be women who have received training and raised their own
families and are willing to move in with a family and be a role model
for the parent(s) and children. No doubt everyone would be on their
best behavior for a few days, but ingrained behavior patterns would
surface and the role model would handle incidents as they arose,
modeling appropriate support for children's schoolwork and
alternative ways to discipline and resolve conflicts, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Would we have to pay a lot for these role models' services? You
bet. Would they be cheaper than foster care? Not at first, because
we'd be paying for both. However, they would teach these children how
to be better parents than their own parents. Are there people foolish
enough to become professional role models, to fix failed families?
You bet. Many of us make our life's work trying to make this world a
better place.</TE>

<TE>   Because of a concern for how the county treats teens who are
parenting, I recently had the privilege of seeing firsthand the daily
proceedings at Edelman Children's Court. "Forging Strong Adults from
Hard-Knock Kids" (Dec. 24) illuminates the sad picture I encountered.</TE>
<TE>   You offer good solutions and are correct to note that things have
improved for teens needing transitional housing. However, your
readers should be aware that L.A. County has about six, but no more
than 12, transitional spaces for parenting teens. While the county is
unable to document the number of teens in its charge who are parents,
there is reason to believe that there are several hundred. Another
good step toward improving the system would be to keep tabs on the
number of teen parents and assist them with their housing needs.</TE>

<LD>Re "North Korea Ratchets Up Its Nuclear Efforts," Dec. 23: I hope the
Bush administration listens to the voices of reason, experience and
statesmanship, Sens. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) and Joseph L. Biden
Jr. (D-Del.), in dealing with North Korea. Both senators know that
diplomacy is what makes this world a safer place. "We're all going to
have to talk, talk continuously," Lugar said.</LD>
<LD>   As the U.S. prepares for a war in Iraq while foolishly believing
that the rest of the world will be supportive, Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld boasts how the U.S. can win wars in North Korea and
Iraq at the same time, a reckless strategy of intimidation. What the
members of this administration need to understand, if it's not too
late, is that perception is everything. They need to take it
seriously when other countries feel threatened by us, have the
maturity not to take it personally and tap into the wisdom of a
peaceful approach. They have a responsibility to work diplomatically,
ease tensions and build relationships. It's a lot cheaper than a
faulty missile defense system and a lot safer than risking the lives
of countless civilians and those in our armed forces.</LD>

<TE>   "Military Action Possible, U.S. Warns N. Korea" (Dec. 24)convinced
me that the administration has gone over the edge. I believe that the
current gang in Washington is a dangerous threat to mankind, and if
Congress had a backbone it would consider impeachment.</TE>

of mass destruction. Who are we going after next? Zambia, Nigeria,
Haiti?</TE>

<TE>   It is indeed arrogant and, yes, ignorant, for Rumsfeld to threaten
North Korea with swift defeat. North Korea is no Iraq. That is why we
treat it with kid gloves and Iraq with an iron fist.</TE>
<TE>   Our 37,000 troops in South Korea are in extreme danger if North
Korea delivers on its threat of "uncontrollable catastrophe." This
administration's hawks have managed to do the impossible; this is the
first time in the last 54 years that both Koreas are united over one
thing -- anger and hate toward the U.S.</TE>

<TE>   Re "S. Koreans Shrug Off Nuclear Threat," Dec. 26: The South
Korean attitude underscores that famous phrase: "There is nothing
'free' in freedom." They may be right that North Korea is no threat.
If it were to drop a nuclear bomb on the South, it would do as much
harm to itself, via the fallout. Still, history demonstrates that nut
cases as heads of state have problems embracing rational thinking. In
the final analysis, it will be South Korea as the guinea pig to test
this novel geopolitical theory and their lives and freedom to win or
lose, not ours.</TE>
<TE>   Bring our troops home and let them figure that out for themselves.
It's no wonder that our best friends in the world are in Eastern
Europe, people who know all too well the price of freedom.</TE>

<LD>Justice Janice Rogers Brown's sharp dissents on the California
Supreme Court have frequently vexed her colleagues, but never has the
tension been more public than in People vs. Mar.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling earlier this year limited the use of stun belts --
devices that some criminal defendants have been forced to wear in
court so they can be zapped with a jolt of electricity if they
disrupt proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   The significance of the ruling attracted wide news coverage, but
legal scholars and court analysts were more intrigued by the fine
print. Dueling footnotes by Brown, the sole dissenter, and Chief
Justice Ronald M. George, who wrote the opinion, provided a rare
glimpse into behind-the-scene strains within the court.</LD>
<TE>   Brown's dissent belittled the court's research into stun belts
and, in particular, its reliance on student comment in a law review.
The student work came from St. Mary's University School of Law, and
Brown made fun in a footnote of what she considered the school's
obscurity.</TE>
<TE>   "For those who may not have heard of it,'' the footnote read, "St.
Mary's University School of Law is located in San Antonio, Texas.''
In the following days, a newspaper ran an article mentioning that
U.S. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist had taught at the school's
overseas campus. Other U.S. Supreme Court jurists also have lectured
there.</TE>
<TE>   Someone must have pointed this out to Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Court opinions are not final for at least 30 days, and Brown later
modified her dissent by taking out the sarcastic reference to St.
Mary's. She did not yield on her criticism of the majority's use of
student research, however. In another modification, she put italics
around the phrase "student comment'' in a sentence that criticized
the court's research.</TE>
<TE>   George fired back with a modification of his own. "Of course,'' he
wrote in a footnote, "it is customary for the opinions of appellate
courts to include citations to the published work of student
authors."</TE>
<TE>   It is so customary that Brown herself has done it, he observed.
Brown cited "a student Comment in Gonzaga Law Review, a student
Comment in the University of Richmond Law Review and a student Note
in the California Law Review" in a previous court opinion she wrote,
the footnote reported.</TE>
<TE>   "When tension under the surface bubbles up like this, it is so
noticeable because it is so out of character of the way courts
usually conduct themselves,'' said University of Santa Clara law
professor Gerald Uelmen.</TE>
<TE>   Convention requires that courts maintain a facade of collegiality,
and judges on appellate panels generally insist that they respect
each other even if they disagree. The exchange of footnotes in the
Mar case appears more personal than collegial.</TE>
<TE>   "It tells us there is some real friction between the chief and
Justice Brown," Uelmen said. Brown's "gratuitous insult in her
dissent ... is the kind of thing that can really get under the skin
of the target," the professor said.</TE>
<TE>   Justices on the state high court were reluctant to discuss the
exchange. One justice said tensions on the court should not be made
public, and another justice described the footnote battle as
"unusual."</TE>
<TE>   George's opinion overturned the conviction of a man who had been
forced to wear a stun belt while testifying. The ruling made it
difficult, if not impossible, for judges to order defendants to wear
the devices.</TE>
<TE>   Brown would have upheld the conviction without any comment on the
potential dangers of stun belts.</TE>
<TE>   The footnote about St. Mary's was not the only comment Brown made
in her dissent that derided her colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   She also accused her colleagues of "rushing to judgment after
conducting an embarrassing Google.com search'' and implied that a
high school student could have done a better job than the chief
justice in preparing the majority ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "A high school student who turned in a research paper with a
bibliography like that would be unlikely to get high marks for either
the distinction or balance of the authorities cited,'' she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Former Gov. Pete Wilson appointed George and Brown, and both are
Republican. But the justices are frequently out of sync on the court.</TE>
<TE>   George is a moderate who is sensitive to the court's public image
and the practical effects of the court's rulings. He is willing to
stick his neck out and rule in a way that might bring him criticism,
but he tempers his legal opinions to defuse controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, on the other hand, is often single-minded in expressing her
views. Quiet and reserved in person, she can deploy withering prose
in trying to discredit the reasoning of the majority. She also is one
of the most conservative members of the court on civil cases.</TE>
<TE>   "Justice Brown has an in-your-face style that the chief justice
and probably the other justices understandably don't like," said
Stephen Barnett, a professor at UC Berkeley's law school. "Sometimes
she does go a little far, but I think her approach is refreshing."</TE>
<TE>   He said the other justices should not take her criticism
"personally."</TE>
<TE>   But Clark Kelso, a professor at McGeorge School of Law, described
Brown's dissent in Mar as "over the top."</TE>
<TE>   "You can disagree with the majority without having language that
suggests somehow that the majority lacks intelligence," Kelso said.</TE>
<TE>   The case was by no means the first in which George and Brown have
sparred. Brown wasn't on the court long when George asked her to tone
down her dissents, a request she rebuffed, court sources say.</TE>
<TE>   In a concurring opinion two years ago, George took Brown to task
for the way she had written a majority ruling that overturned an
affirmative action program.</TE>
<TE>   Although he agreed with her on the ruling, he accused her of being
"less than evenhanded'' and of creating "a serious distortion of
history" in her statements about affirmative action .</TE>
<TE>   Brown is a loner on the court. Some of the other justices are
reluctant to sign her dissents because of their tone, sources said,
and she and George communicate by memo.</TE>
<TE>   Kelso said he thought it was appropriate that George had defended
the use of student research in response to Brown's "overkill"
dissent, but he added that the court is poorly served by such
exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   "The pages of judicial reports are not a place to vent spleen and
not a place to highlight personal differences," Kelso said. "It is a
place to say what the law is and how the law should develop."</TE>

<HD>Big Effort by Tiny Town's Band</HD>
<DH>Funding Rose Parade trip was tough row to hoe for rural
musicians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joe Mathews</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For high school bands, a once-in-a-lifetime invitation to march in
the Rose Parade touches off an immediate announcement and joyous
celebration.</LD>
<LD>   But when Don Rogers, band director at Attica Senior High School,
got the word that his musicians could come to Pasadena to march in
the 2003 Tournament of Roses, he kept the news to himself for three
weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "I had to do some soul-searching," says Rogers, who let only his
wife in on the secret. "I didn't know if we were on this level."</LD>
<TE>   Most Rose Parade bands have far more resources than Rogers'. They
often come from big high schools in prosperous suburbs, where they
are supported by booster clubs with the funds to fly young musicians
to national competitions or prestigious parades year after year.</TE>
<TE>   Attica High has just 600 students. It is in a small, rural
community in economically depressed western New York state. Its band
has always traveled by bus. The town is best known for a prison riot
31 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers wondered if his musicians could come up with the $1,000 per
head it would take to get to the Rose Parade. And even if they could
find the money, he wondered, how many band parents would agree, after
Sept. 11, to put their children on a plane?</TE>
<TE>   Despite his misgivings, Rogers decided to accept. The Attica band
is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles on Saturday, propelled by,
among other things, a cornfield maze and at least two dead steers.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has had a longer road to Pasadena," says Gary Thomas, the
Tournament of Roses president, who visited Attica last spring to
encourage the band. "They are a real underdog band."</TE>
<TE>   Their comeback story begins with the 57-year-old Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from a college in upstate New York 37 years ago,
he received his best job offer from the Attica school district:
elementary school music teacher. He taught in a two-room schoolhouse
at first and later spent 11 years as middle school band director, a
term interrupted for a three-year Army tour.</TE>
<TE>   When he took over the high school band in 1979, Rogers switched
its emphasis from concerts to marching in hopes of doing more
traveling. But some of the band's performances in the 1980s were
marked by hecklers who made references to the 1971 prison riot at
Attica that killed 32 inmates and 11 prison employees.</TE>
<TE>   "It was difficult to go on the road," Rogers says. "Our kids
became fed up. A lot of the time, they played angry."</TE>
<TE>   But as time passed and memories faded, the heckling died down and
the band grew. It now has 215 of Attica's current enrollment of 615
(the highest percentage of participation of any high school band in
the parade).</TE>
<TE>   In recruiting, Rogers learned to be flexible. He has grown
accustomed to losing some of his players -- many of whom are farm
kids -- during the harvest.</TE>
<TE>   And, at a small school determined to field sports teams, 85% of
his band members play a sport; it's not unusual for many of the band
members, in their athletic uniforms, to take up their instruments
right after a game.</TE>
<TE>   It has been over the last five years, Rogers says, that "the band
took a couple of steps up."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, it earned a spot in Detroit's Thanksgiving Day parade. A
year later, it performed well in a prestigious festival in Virginia,
and in 2001 it garnered a place in the Orange Bowl Parade. The bus
trip to Florida took 30 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Parade officials noticed the Miami performance and encouraged
Rogers to apply.</TE>
<TE>   While most bands submit letters of recommendation from senators
and governors, Attica's came from hotels where the band had stayed
and from the Buffalo Bills football team, for which it sometimes
plays.</TE>
<TE>   Parade officials were charmed.</TE>
<TE>   Leighton Anderson, a member of the tournament's music committee,
called Rogers in November 2001 and suggested, Why don't you come out
and watch the parade?</TE>
<TE>   Why? asked Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   Because you're going to be in it next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I never would have imagined I would bring a band to California,"
he says now.</TE>
<TE>   Preparation has not been easy.</TE>
<TE>   He has slowed down the band's cadence to match the speed of the
Rose Parade and has told some members to lose weight.</TE>
<TE>   The trip will cost $250,000 -- a huge amount for Attica, but about
half what many other bands will spend. Attica's musicians will save
money by limiting the number of tourist attractions they visit to two
(many bands visit four) and spending time decorating a float instead.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most of the Attica area's businesses have pitched in on
fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Band supporters even created a maze in a six-acre cornfield and
charged admission ($5 per person, $15 per family); from the air, the
maze looked like a rose that was framed by the words "Attica band."</TE>
<TE>   "The fund-raising has gone so well," says Norb Fuest, a longtime
band parent, who estimates that the money has cut the per-person cost
down to about $700. "Now, some of these kids realize they actually
are getting on a plane, and many have never flown before. They are
pretty nervous about it."</TE>
<TE>   Drum major Nicole Kelver, who lives on her family's dairy farm,
went even further. She and her brother Benjamin, a freshman saxophone
player, raised two steers specifically to help them for the trip. The
animals brought a total of $600 at slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rose Bowl steers help, and I know we aren't getting much for
Christmas this year," she says. "This has been hard, but I'm glad Mr.
Rogers is taking us. Material things don't mean much when you have a
chance to be in that parade."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who crashed his car into a utility pole in Cerritos and fled
into two homes, stabbing a woman in the stomach, was in custody
Thursday night after residents subdued him with a pot of boiling
water, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's deputies said Thanh Nguyen, 30, of Stockton was arguing
with his girlfriend as he drove down 166th Street about noon when he
lost control of the car and struck a telephone pole.</LD>
<LD>   He ran into a home in the 16600 block of Moorbrook Avenue, pushing
a woman aside and grabbing a knife from her kitchen, deputies said.
He ran around the block to Stowers Avenue and entered another house
through a garage door.</LD>
<TE>   There he stabbed a woman and bit her husband, deputies said. The
husband and neighbors subdued Nguyen after tossing scalding water at
him.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   The Stowers Avenue woman sustained stab wounds in her stomach, leg
and hands. Her husband suffered a bite on the hand. They were being
treated at St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood.</TE>

<KH>REFLECTIONS ON 2002: COURTS</KH>
<HD>'Under God' Ruling Spurred Angry Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a year in which child abductions, a July 4 shooting at LAX and
the arrests of aging radicals and Catholic priests for decades-old
crimes drew headlines.</LD>
<LD>   But it was an appellate decision concerning a couple of famous
words that provoked unparalleled legal controversy in 2002, a
firestorm that reached the White House and classrooms across the
nation.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in
June that the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional when recited
in classrooms because the words "under God" endorse religion.</LD>
<TE>   The decision, stemming from a lawsuit by an atheist father upset
about the recitation of the pledge in his daughter's elementary
school, was condemned by President Bush, Gov. Gray Davis and the U.S.
Senate. The Justice Department asked the court to rehear the case. In
the meantime, the ruling has been put on hold and children continue
to recite the pledge.</TE>
<TE>   Other court-related happenings caused some parishioners to be
concerned about their spiritual leaders, parents to fear for their
children's safety and baby boomers to remember the turbulent 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Among the top criminal justice stories: Former members of the
radical Symbionese Liberation Army pleaded guilty to a 27-year-old
murder, an outspoken East Coaster took the reins of the troubled Los
Angeles Police Department, a San Francisco couple were convicted in
the dog-mauling death of a neighbor and two Inglewood police officers
were indicted after the videotaped beating of a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   Several celebrities also made legal headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Blake, star of the 1970s television series "Baretta," was
arrested in April and charged with murdering his wife, Bonny Lee
Bakley, outside a Studio City restaurant in 2001. Prosecutors say he
tried to solicit two Hollywood stuntmen and then conspired with his
bodyguard to kill her. Blake, who insists that he is not guilty, is
being held in the Los Angeles County Jail without bail.</TE>
<TE>   Film star Winona Ryder was convicted in November of felony grand
theft and vandalism for shoplifting more than $5,500 worth of
designer clothes from Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   One guard testified at her trial that she had seen the
Oscar-nominated actress snip off security tags and later walk out of
the posh department store without paying for much of the merchandise
she was carrying. She was sentenced to three years' probation, mental
health counseling and 480 hours of community service.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal within the Catholic church swept across the nation as
alleged victims accused priests of sexual abuse. Six current or
former Archdiocese of Los Angeles priests were arrested and charged
with child molestation, including one who was taken into custody
while on a cruise bound for eastern Russia.</TE>
<TE>   More than 70 one-time clerics in the Los Angeles Archdiocese are
under investigation in connection with allegations of abuse dating as
far back as 1946.</TE>
<TE>   An unsettling string of child abductions began in February, when
7-year-old Danielle van Dam disappeared from her bedroom in a San
Diego suburb. Her body was found 25 days later along a rural road.
Neighbor David Westerfield was convicted of kidnapping and murdering
the girl, whose blood was found in his recreational vehicle and on
his jacket. A jury recommended that he be executed.</TE>
<TE>   Another high-profile abduction unfolded in Orange County. Samantha
Runnion, 5, was grabbed by a stranger as she played with a friend
outside her home in July. Her body was discovered the next day along
a mountain road. Alejandro Avila, a factory worker, was arrested and
faces charges that could bring the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The number of kidnappings also led to the use of the "Amber Alert"
network, which posts information about abducted children on radio, TV
and digital freeway signs.</TE>
<TE>   The alert system was praised for helping authorities rescue two
teenage girls abducted at gunpoint from an Antelope Valley lovers'
lane in August. Authorities tracked down the kidnapper in Kern
County, shooting him to death and bringing the girls to safety.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, William J. Bratton was selected in October to
reform the Los Angeles Police Department amid a rising crime rate,
low morale and a tarnished public image.</TE>
<TE>   The former New York City Police commissioner immediately announced
ambitious plans to turn the department around. But in a reflection of
the formidable challenges, 14 people were killed over a four-day
period in November, pushing the city's murder count to the highest
annual total since the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Several high-profile cases landed in California trial courtrooms
in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the year, four members of the Symbionese Liberation Army
were charged with the 1975 shotgun killing of a churchgoing mother of
four during a bank robbery near Sacramento. Last month, the aging
defendants -- Emily Montague, William Harris, Michael Bortin and Sara
Jane Olson -- pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. The day after
the pleas, the final fugitive, James Kilgore, was arrested in South
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Two Inglewood police officers were indicted by the Los Angeles
County Grand Jury on felony charges in July, just days after a
videotape showed a handcuffed 16-year-old being slammed onto the
trunk of a patrol car and struck in the face.</TE>
<TE>   The tape attracted nationwide attention, drawing comparisons with
the 1991 beating of Rodney G. King. Officer Jeremy Morse was charged
with assault under the color of authority and his partner, Bijan
Darvish, was charged with filing a false police report. Both are free
on bail, awaiting trial in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley also began a criminal
investigation into Entertainment Industry Development Corp. and its
president, Cody Cluff, with a series of raids from Hollywood
Boulevard to Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were seeking evidence to determine whether Cluff and
the EIDC, which coordinates city and county film permitting, had
misused corporate funds on lavish expenses and political
contributions to elected officials on its governing board. Cluff, who
has not been charged, recently stepped down from his post with the
EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles federal court, too, was highlighted this year by
numerous indictments against a variety of public officials, law
enforcement officers and corporate executives.</TE>
<TE>   The most sensational case was filed in November against Carson
Mayor Daryl Sweeney and three other present or former City Council
members accused of extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars from
waste haulers and other firms seeking municipal contracts. Also
indicted were three waste-hauling executives and two alleged
middlemen.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles police officers Rafael Perez and Nino Durden,
central figures in the LAPD's Rampart corruption scandal, were
sentenced in federal court to prison terms after pleading guilty to
violating the civil rights of suspected gang members by fabricating
evidence against them.</TE>
<TE>   A high-profile defendant awaiting trial in a federal case, Irv
Rubin, died in November after leaping over a jail balcony at the
Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, according to the FBI.
Rubin, the firebrand national leader of the Jewish Defense League,
was awaiting trial for allegedly plotting to bomb a Culver City
mosque.</TE>
<TE>   In a Los Angeles civil courtroom, a jury awarded a record $28
billion in punitive damages against Philip Morris Cos. in a case
brought by a longtime smoker with lung and liver cancer. The trial
judge later reduced the award to $28 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Pledge of Allegiance decision was not the only major appellate
decision in the state this year.</TE>
<TE>   The California Supreme Court ruled in August that criminal
defendants in court should no longer be forced to wear stun belts,
which can discharge debilitating electric shocks, unless there is no
less onerous alternative. The state high court also protected medical
marijuana users in a ruling that required prosecutors to dismiss
charges if a patient has evidence of a doctor's approval.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 9th Circuit struck down two long sentences imposed under
California's three-strikes law, saying that a 25-years-to-life term
for petty theft constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The
question of the validity of California's three-strikes law is pending
before the U.S. Supreme Court, stemming from a decision that a
50-years-to-life sentence for stealing children's videos had been
grossly disproportionate to the offense.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit also overturned several death sentences and upheld
California's assault weapons control act, ruling that individuals
have no constitutional right to keep and bear arms.</TE>
<TE>   And the court ruled that inmates have no constitutional right to
impregnate their wives by mailing sperm from a prison.</TE>

<HD>24 Cars Struck by 2 Drivers</HD>
<DH>The out-of-control motorists ran into mostly parked
vehicles in separate incidents Christmas night.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two out-of-control drivers struck a total of 24 cars in separate Los
Angeles incidents Christmas night, police said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Just before midnight, a driver zigzagged down Normandie Avenue,
crashing into 10 cars, most of them parked, police said. He turned
east on Beverly Boulevard and was finally stopped at Kenmore Avenue,
where patrol officers who had heard the last of the collisions from a
few blocks away caught up with the careening car.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Bill Urrutia of the Central Traffic Division said the driver
probably caused hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage.</LD>
<TE>   He was so drunk he hit cars "and continued on. He probably
would've kept going," Urrutia said. "His car is totaled."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the driver was booked on suspicion of felony drunk
driving. They would not release his name.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the night, a driver hit a parked car at Franklin Avenue
and Vista Street in Hollywood before turning south on Vista and
nicking 13 more parked cars. He told authorities one of his tires had
blown out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still hard for me to believe that even with a blown-out tire
you hit 14 cars," said Sgt. Russ Kilby of the West Traffic Division.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the 66-year-old driver finally came to a stop when his
car became disabled. He was treated at a hospital for minor injuries.
There was no indication of criminal intent or drunk driving, Kilby
said, but police may seek the revocation of the man's driver's
license.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, glass from car windows was strewn along Normandie,
where a few men were tending to their gnarled cars.</TE>
<TE>   "He just came up from behind and slammed into me," said Andres
Rivera, 46, who had been driving home with his two children after a
movie. "I didn't see him at all. He just took off."</TE>

<HD>Cal State Fullerton Taking PR to China</HD>
<DH>The master's program seeks to dovetail with the nation's
move toward a market economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Anton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Fred Zandpour's flight was delayed in Hong Kong, the plane sat
on the runway for two hours. Yet no one announced to the restless
passengers what was going on or how long they would be stuck there.</LD>
<LD>   Later, when some luggage was lost in Shanghai, "we didn't get much
in the way of customer service," Zandpour said.</LD>
<LD>   None of this surprised Zandpour, associate dean of Cal State
Fullerton's College of Communications, which in February will begin
offering a master's program in advertising and public relations to
Chinese students at the University of Hong Kong's School of
Professional and Continuing Education.</LD>
<TE>   "Public relations in China is not good," Zandpour said. "As China
moves toward a market economy, it needs a lot more people who
understand promotion and selling."</TE>
<TE>   Public relations is an industry in its infancy in China. Large
U.S. firms didn't set up shop in China until the mid-1980s. Until
recently, locally driven public relations efforts were orchestrated
by the government -- and often lubricated with bribes.</TE>
<TE>   "Advertising and public relations have become big issues in China
now, with their acceptance into the World Trade Organization and with
the 2008 Olympics in Beijing," said Rick Pullen, dean of Cal State
Fullerton's communications college. "It's a very hot topic in China."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, surveys from the China International Public Relations
Assn. show revenue generated by the nation's public relations
industry doubled from 1999 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Pullen said the University of Hong Kong officials sought out Cal
State Fullerton, which has one of only 11 public relations programs
certified by the Public Relations Society of America.</TE>
<TE>   "Here in the U.S., we understand what you must do so people
understand your message," Pullen said.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 students have signed up for the program's first session,
which will be taught in English by a Cal State Fullerton faculty
member. The university hopes to expand its program to Shanghai and to
develop a student-exchange program.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who have signed up for classes are modern Chinese
students," Pullen said.</TE>
<TE>   "They know what's going on in the world. They are young people who
are well informed. I'm sure there will be some cultural shock from
time to time, but they're ready to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Cultural differences will mean course work will be tailored to a
Chinese audience, however.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be very sensitive. Just because it works here, in our
culture, may not mean it works there," Pullen said.</TE>
<TE>   He cited the use of blatant sexual imagery so common in American
advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not for China," Pullen said.</TE>

<HD>No Touching at Strip Clubs? Lake Forest Called Too Touchy</HD>
<DH>The city says an ordinance could head off prostitution and
drugs. One club calls the rule absurd and poison for business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City officials call it bureaucratic fine-tuning -- a proposed
ordinance banning close contact between topless dancers and customers
at two Lake Forest strip clubs.</LD>
<LD>   But to the dancers, bouncers and managers at Captain Cream, a
freeway-close adult club in the south Orange County community, the
ordinance could be a business killer.</LD>
<LD>   "The idea is not regulation but elimination," said Les Hawthorne,
the club's chief operating officer. "They hope the regulations would
restrict the way we do our business so that they would eventually
eliminate us."</LD>
<TE>   The proposed ordinance would ban physical contact between
entertainers and customers, such as the practice of dancers
sauntering through the largely male crowd, collecting tips. It would
also prohibit performers from getting within six feet of a patron, a
rule that threatens such club staples as "table dances."</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest officials say the ordinance, which comes before the
City Council on Jan. 21, is not meant to put Captain Cream or the
Library, a second Lake Forest club, out of business. The intent, they
say, is to eliminate activity that could lead to "secondary effects,"
such as prostitution or drug abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Management at the Library wouldn't comment, saying it would see
how such rules work out.</TE>
<TE>   Dancers at Captain Cream say the city is creating a double
standard.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you not allowed to tip the pizza delivery guy by handing him
money anymore?" said Nikki, 32, a single mother who has danced at
Captain Cream for two years. "Let's make it the same for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   After her stage performance on a recent afternoon, Nikki strolled
by the tables in the dimly lighted club, slipping dollar-bill tips
inside her skimpy Santa suit and thanking the patrons, some of them
loyal regulars.</TE>
<TE>   Once the ordinance took effect, patrons would be asked to drop
their tips in a jar at least six feet from the stage. "It'll take the
fun out of it for the customers," Nikki said. "And it'll take the
personal touch out of it for us."</TE>
<TE>   The dancers say the freedom to mingle with customers is what
allows them to make a living in a job paid by tips only.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the city is wrong," said Shoni, 37, who says she has a
writing degree from Northwestern University and, like Nikki, prefers
to use only her first name. "We're being singled out for the way we
make our living."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hawthorne, "It's like paying to go into a baseball game and
then watching the game on a monitor."</TE>
<TE>   The club started as a quiet Christian teen dance establishment,
but was eventually turned into a bikini bar where scantily clad women
wrestled in pits of shaving cream.</TE>
<TE>   Later, a former club operator and his ex-wife, a stripper, did
away with shaving-cream wrestling and transformed Captain Cream into
one of Southern California's most widely known topless clubs.</TE>
<TE>   One regular, downing a beer on an afternoon at Captain Cream, said
the proposed ordinance shouldn't have a big effect there.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a low-contact strip club anyway," he said. "Those tips
they collect after the dances are almost like a tax. They come around
and almost everybody gives them a dollar."</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance would also require each dancer to be licensed before
working in such establishments as Captain Cream and the Library,
which is one offramp away on the San Diego Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's discriminating," said Shoni, one of more than 100
dancers employed by Captain Cream. She said the ordinance presupposes
that erotic dancing is decadent and leads to crime.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see it as shameful," she said. "It's been an important
part of most cultures over the years."</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest Mayor Richard T. Dixon insists that "we did not
initiate this ordinance to close up anyone's business."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, city officials say they hope to discourage other
adult establishments from opening in Lake Forest, a quiet
master-planned community of 60,000.</TE>
<TE>   In drafting the ordinance, the city reviewed court cases and
studied the effects of similar ordinances elsewhere. In 1999,
Anaheim's no-touch rule at several nude clubs was struck down by an
appeals court, which ruled that the ordinance went too far by
criminalizing such actions. Lake Forest officials, though, say their
proposed rules are legally sound.</TE>
<TE>   "By eliminating direct contact, studies show that secondary
effects are reduced," said Mark Pulone, Lake Forest's assistant city
manager.</TE>
<TE>   "We're simply trying to eliminate problems that might occur in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sheriff's Department said the neighborhood
around Captain Cream gets, on average, the most police calls in the
city. But Jon Fleischman, a department spokesman, said it's unclear
what impact the new ordinance might have on law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Hawthorne said the concern that physical contact between dancers
and customers at his club might lead to prostitution or drug activity
is off-target. "Just because people come together for adult
entertainment doesn't mean they're interested in prostitution and
drugs," he said. "The concept is that anybody who comes here is so
low that they would only be interested in those things.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is that nobody here wants to get in trouble. The girls
are here to earn a living.... It's like a Cheers in Lake Forest."</TE>
<TE>   Nikki said she'll simply adapt if the ordinance passes. "I guess
I'll just have to get used to a tip jar."</TE>

<HD>2nd Ventura Officer Testifies in Shooting of Girl, 14</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura police officer testified Thursday that a 14-year-old girl
was holding a knife and flailing her arms as she ran down stairs just
before a second officer shot the girl at her foster home in May.</LD>
<LD>   "She became very upset and started yelling and screaming and kind
of brushing and swinging her arms," Officer Greg Knupp said. "As [the
knife] moved, I could see the shine of the blade."</LD>
<LD>   The girl is on trial on suspicion of felony assault of an officer.</LD>
<TE>   But Knupp said the girl was holding the knife at her side during
the seconds he watched her, and that he never saw her raise it. When
he first saw her, Knupp testified, she was pointing the knife's blade
backward.</TE>
<TE>   Knupp's account differs from that of Officer Kristen Rupp, who
last week testified she had no choice but to shoot when the girl
raised the knife and rushed her.</TE>
<TE>   Knupp said his view of the girl was at times obstructed by other
officers, but he remembered hearing Rupp repeatedly telling the girl
to put down the knife.</TE>
<TE>   Rupp has testified she ordered the girl to drop the knife, but
that the girl became enraged and rushed her with the knife. Rupp
backed into the kitchen and shot the girl three times. Two bullets
hit the girl in the abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   Rupp has been cleared of wrongdoing by a departmental
investigation. The girl, a recent Chinese immigrant, has been charged
with assaulting a police officer with a deadly weapon.</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony Thursday, the girl's father, Wei Guo of Newbury
Park, described his daughter's troubled past.</TE>
<TE>   She was born in China and her mother wanted nothing to do with her
after the couple separated, he said. The girl has not seen her mother
since she was about 3 years old, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Guo said the girl spent her early years shuttling between a
boarding school and her grandmother's house in China. In 1998 she
joined Guo, a restaurant owner in the United States, but he said the
adjustment was tough.</TE>
<TE>   "She faced many difficulties," Guo said through a court
interpreter. "The main thing I told her was that everyone has to go
through this phase."</TE>
<TE>   Guo described how a county protective agency removed the girl from
his custody after he beat her with a belt three years ago. She was
sent to China, but was back with her father within months. The county
again removed the girl after she complained about her father's
strictness to a social worker, Guo said.</TE>
<TE>   The case is being monitored closely by members of the Southland's
Chinese American community. It has called for the girl's release.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's attorneys have filed a civil claim against the city of
Ventura and the county, saying the shooting was unjustified and
accusing the county of failing to train the girl's foster family and
not providing adequate treatment for her injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "She's been treated pretty harshly by the system," said Munson
Kwok, a vice president of the Chinese-American Citizens Alliance in
Los Angeles. "We will be looking for an acquittal."</TE>

<LD>Peter Mejia's mother placed him in Judy Zdravje's arms for the first
time when he wasn't much more than a week old.</LD>
<LD>   If words accompanied that motherly gesture, they are long
forgotten. But Zdravje, who has worked at the Variety Boys and Girls
Club in Boyle Heights for 32 years, knew it was a silent plea for
help.</LD>
<LD>   The absent father and the mother hobbled by kidney problems were
less important than the real message: "It can be a difficult
neighborhood, and a dangerous one," Zdravje said.</LD>
<TE>   Drugs and gangs pulled Mejia's older brother out of orbit; an
early pregnancy saddled his sister with too much responsibility, too
soon. Mejia is 25 now, and a college student.</TE>
<TE>   He also works at the club that made the difference for him.
"Without it, I think I would have gone the other way," Mejia said.</TE>
<TE>   Since its opening in 1949, the club has helped thousands of
children navigate their way to adulthood through the maze of social
ills that claim so many others. The club uses everyday tools to
prepare its 145 members for the world: pool tables, computers, chips,
soda, books. There's a lesson in every activity, and a set of rules
that, aside from an annual fee of $4, is the only cost of admission.</TE>
<TE>   Homework comes first, during the "power hour." Children earn chits
for completed assignments, and spend their earnings at a "store"
selling everything from bags of chips to Dodgers baseball caps and
sidewalk scooters.</TE>
<TE>   There, the children, from 7 to 17, learn to budget and save. A bag
of chips is $2, but a scooter costs a cool $100.</TE>
<TE>   Even during games of Foosball, pool, chess and dominoes, the
children learn social skills and responsibility: When you check out a
pool cue, say "please" and "thank you." Respect your opponent. Show
your membership card.</TE>
<TE>   Children can create their own Web sites in a computer lab, learn
woodworking in the crafts room, or study in a small library.</TE>
<TE>   Club members volunteer for graffiti removal and trash pickups in
the neighborhood. For three graduating members every year, there's a
$10,000 college scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   Most staff members are alumni -- adults who appreciate what the
club once did for them. Less known than the outlaws and thugs who
give the neighborhood a bad name, they're products of Boyle Heights,
too.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at these children. They're wonderful," Zdravje said, as a
group huddled over homework recently. "We just have to help them be
wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   This season, The Times is featuring organizations that have

<HD>The Prize: A Home of Her Very Own</HD>
<DH>Waitress Normene Woods doggedly pursues her dream of buying
a house. A federal program may help it happen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hanah Cho</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Normene Woods sees a soda can or bottle, she picks it up --
whether it's on the street or at the soul food restaurant where she
works as a cashier and waitress.</LD>
<LD>   At five cents a can or bottle, Woods said she makes about $45 a
month.</LD>
<LD>   She calls it "hustling" for a home of her own.</LD>
<TE>   For several months, the 46-year-old Inglewood mother of two
teenage boys and an adult daughter has been setting aside her modest
profits in hopes of raising enough for a down payment on her first
house.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who hopes to raise at least $3,600 by next summer, is now
trying to take advantage of an option under the federal Section 8
housing assistance program that allows some low-income families to
use the equivalent of their rental assistance toward monthly mortgage
payments.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Inglewood, which adopted the mortgage option in
November, other area housing agencies offering the homeownership
program include those in Los Angeles, Long Beach and Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   To be eligible for the program, residents receiving rental
assistance must meet requirements that include a minimum income level
and continuous employment for at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Inglewood Housing Authority wanted to move families on housing
assistance to self-sufficiency, said Art Waller, housing manager for
the Inglewood Community Development and Housing Department.</TE>
<TE>   The agency administers rental vouchers for 1,700 families, with
4,800 more on a waiting list, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It would give families the opportunity to live the American
dream, so to speak," Waller said. "It would build equity and wealth,
and stabilize the living situation."</TE>
<TE>   Because the homeownership option is voluntary, not all housing
authorities believe the program will work in their areas. The U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development does not provide
additional funds or vouchers for the homeownership program.</TE>
<TE>   Since Congress approved the homeownership program in 1999, about
500 families nationwide have used it to buy homes, according to HUD.
About 200 of the 1,200 housing authorities that administer the
Section 8 program offer the homeownership option, HUD said.</TE>
<TE>   In California, a little more than a dozen housing authorities
offer the program. An early participant, the San Bernardino County
Housing Authority, has helped eight families buy homes, said Sandy
Henson, development and acquisition manager for the authority.</TE>
<TE>   In Inglewood, housing officials hope to help the first family move
out of an apartment and into a house by the end of 2003, Waller said.</TE>
<TE>   Within five years, officials say, they want to see 25 Inglewood
families living in their own homes.</TE>
<TE>   Though HUD sets the criteria for eligibility, local housing
authorities can impose other requirements. Here's how the program
works in Inglewood:</TE>
<TE>   Participants must have a minimum annual income of $13,500. They
must work at least 30 hours a week and have been employed for at
least one year, have a good record as a Section 8 recipient, be a
first-time home buyer, and raise a down payment of at least 3%.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum time for assistance under the homeownership program is
15 years, meaning the buyer must have reached some level of
self-sufficiency to continue the terms of the mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   After participants are ruled eligible, they work directly with
Inglewood Neighborhood Housing Services, which provides extensive
counseling and helps secure mortgages.</TE>
<TE>   It can take up to two years from enrollment to closing the deal on
the house.</TE>
<TE>   The toughest part of the process may be finding affordable homes
in the current real estate market, some housing officials say.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the housing agency in Los Angeles County, for one,
decided against participating in the Section 8 homeownership program
in unincorporated areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Oftentimes you read about people paying or offering above the
asking price," said Marie Quon-Hom, assistant director of the
assisted housing division of the Los Angeles County Housing
Authority. "It's not a good market right now because of that."</TE>
<TE>   But officials in Inglewood are not discouraged.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be opportunities to purchase a home," said Waller,
Inglewood's housing manager. "You'll never know until you give it a
shot."</TE>
<TE>   Martina Guilfoil, executive director of Inglewood Neighborhood
Housing Services, points to the program's benefits not only for the
families but for the community.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who earns $1,400 a month at the restaurant, puts $300 a
month into a savings account sponsored by Housing Services, which
matches the money 5 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is Woods' "hustling."</TE>
<TE>   One day, when boxer Mike Tyson came into the restaurant -- the
Serving Spoon in Inglewood -- Woods said she took pictures of her
customers with the fighter. Then she bought some frames at a bargain
store.</TE>
<TE>   By selling the photos for $10 each, she made an $80 profit.</TE>
<TE>   "That went into my house account," she said. "Like I said: I'll do
what I have to do to come up with my $300."</TE>

<HD>Rural Hospital Appeals for Funds</HD>
<DH>Without a $600,000 infusion, 39-bed Santa Paula Memorial
may be forced to make severe staff reductions or close its doors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Polakovic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cash-strapped Santa Paula Memorial Hospital is testing how deep the
holiday spirit runs with an urgent plea for donations to keep the
Santa Clara Valley's only hospital afloat.</LD>
<LD>   For the second year in a row, the Ventura County hospital has gone
into the community, hand extended, seeking hundreds of thousands of
dollars to keep its doors open for a few more months. Without
$600,000 in donations, the facility -- a lifeline for thousands of
residents in the farm belt from Santa Paula to Fillmore and Piru --
could be forced to drastically downsize or shut down.</LD>
<LD>   The plea the hospital sent to supporters last Friday and spread
through newspaper ads on Sunday, is grim. It warns that the
41-year-old hospital, built from community contributions, is "on the
edge of a precipice" and could be "forced to permanently close its
doors" unless it stems a cash-flow problem of "drastic proportions."</LD>
<TE>   It adds that any donations made to the nonprofit medical center
before Dec. 31 are tax deductible on 2002 returns.</TE>
<TE>   If the plight of the tiny 39-bed hospital sounds familiar, it is
because Santa Paula Memorial has been experiencing hard times for a
while.</TE>
<TE>   The facility, operating at a loss since the 1980s, was forced to
borrow money for the first time earlier this year. A decade of losses
has drained $14 million from its reserves.</TE>
<TE>   "This is real. This is not just a promotion to get people to
donate money," said rancher Anita Tate, a longtime member of the
hospital board of directors. "There's a limit to how long you can
operate without making money."</TE>
<TE>   The problems at Santa Paula Memorial are indicative of a wider
crisis in rural health care in California.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-six hospitals have closed in Southern California in the
last seven years and nearly two-thirds of 440 hospitals in the state
are losing money on operations, according to the Health Care Assn. of
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula Memorial lost $325,000 last month alone, officials
said. It costs $1.3 million a month to operate, and expenses are
climbing by 2% per year.</TE>
<TE>   The money pays for a maternity unit, surgery stations and a
round-the-clock emergency room, the only one for miles around.</TE>

<TE>   The facility, operating at a loss since the 1980s, was forced to
borrow money for the first time earlier this year. A decade of losses
has drained $14 million from its reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Filling even its three dozen beds is proving increasingly
difficult as the facility loses customers to outpatient clinics and
bigger hospitals in Ventura and beyond. A similar plea for donations
from the community netted more than $120,000 earlier in the year,
said Mark Gregson, the hospital's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   "This is real. This is not just a promotion to get people to
donate money," said rancher Anita Tate, a longtime member of the
hospital board of directors. "There's a limit to how long you can
operate without making money."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital has stayed afloat through decades of special
donations or bequests from artists, ranchers, doctors and even a
movie star -- Kirk Douglas -- whose life was saved by its doctors
after a helicopter crash.</TE>
<TE>   The problems at Santa Paula Memorial are indicative of a wider
crisis in rural health care in California. Twenty-six hospitals have
closed in Southern California in the last seven years and nearly
two-thirds of 440 hospitals in the state are losing money on
operations, according to the Health Care Assn. of Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Avery, executive director of Rural Health Care Center, said
some small hospitals will not survive. Many are old, have inefficient
facilities and high maintenance costs and are in poor communities.
"It's very expensive to maintain a hospital in California in a small
town with a low population and low utilization. These small, rural,
isolated hospitals are slowly deteriorating," Avery said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula Memorial lost $325,000 last month alone, officials
said. It costs $1.3 million a month to operate, and expenses are
climbing by 2% per year. The money pays for a maternity unit, surgery
stations and a round-the-clock emergency room, the only one for miles
around.</TE>
<TE>   For many of the 45,000 residents of small towns along the lower
Santa Clara River the hospital could be the difference between life
and death.</TE>
<TE>   "I can think of about 200 heart attack patients that we have taken
there that I know would have died had that hospital not been there,"
Fillmore Fire Chief Pat Askren said of the facility. "There are
people on the street today who would not be around without that
hospital."</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Paula hospital was built with citizen donations from
1959 to 1961. Keeping it open is not only good for the health of
citizens, officials said, but is a source of pride in the farm town
of 28,000 residents. It is one of Santa Paula's biggest employers
with 250 workers, 180 full time.</TE>
<TE>   Gregson said the hospital has been working to increase revenue.
Surgeons do more operations and more babies are delivered. State
grants have paid for treating obesity, diabetes in children and teen
pregnancy. Administrators are trying to persuade more doctors to send
patients to Santa Paula Memorial instead of other hospitals. Gregson
said they are working with employers in the Santa Clara Valley to
include the hospital in employee health plans.</TE>
<TE>   While those measures are improving the hospital's bottom line and
eventually should help it to balance its budget, Gregson would not
predict when that might occur.Today, the long-awaited turnaround is
facing a new set of obstacles. Government budget cuts mean less money
will be available for Medicare and Medi-Cal patients.</TE>
<TE>   The sour economy is drying up private contributions. Changes in
managed health care, too, work against Santa Paula Memorial. For
example, the hospital has no contract with Kaiser, and other
health-care plans do not cover many of the costs incurred there.</TE>
<TE>   Making matters worse, the hospital and doctors are in a dispute
over costs for medical care. Local physicians refer more people to
out-patient clinics, which are cheaper to operate, to save insurance
costs. To make up for the lost business, the hospital seeks a new
contract for more money from Valley Care Independent Physician Assn.,
which includes the doctors who use the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Said Tate: "The big picture is we've been losing money because we
live in a medical environment that is dominated by insurance
companies, and we have suffered as citizens move to other hospitals
at the request of HMOs."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael Swartout, a Santa Paula internist and medical director
for Valley Care, said the more money physicians pay to Santa Paula
Memorial, the less they have available from insurance companies to
spend on patients. Nevertheless, he said local doctors recognize the
need to keep the hospital open.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to use that hospital. We're going to work to continue our
contract with Santa Paula hospital," Swartout said.</TE>

<HD>Big Bear Area Shooting Probe Takes an Odd Turn</HD>
<DH>Two 1967 murders may be cited as evidence in trials of
parents, son charged after near-fatal June attack on woman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High above the flatlands of San Bernardino County, after a Big Bear
man was accused of shooting his girlfriend and then leaving her in
his garage, investigators began focusing on the man's parents.</LD>
<LD>   First they uncovered evidence that the parents tended to the
woman's wounds for almost a week, but didn't call paramedics for help
because they wanted to protect their son.</LD>
<LD>   Then authorities discovered a hidden room in the parents' cabin
containing a cache of weapons, including hand grenades. That, it
turned out, only opened the door to a decades-old criminal intrigue.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators confirmed Friday that they are dusting off
35-year-old legal records indicating that the shooting suspect's
father was involved in the execution-style killings of two men -- a
crime that temporarily landed the father on the FBI's most wanted
list in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond being an unusual coincidence, those killings may be
introduced as evidence next year when the parents and their son go to
trial on charges related to the June 27 shooting of the woman in
Baldwin Lake, a community named for a dry lake bed on the outskirts
of Big Bear.</TE>
<TE>   The family has maintained to investigators that the shooting of
Christina Marie "Tina" Stebbins was accidental, and that she asked
not to be taken to a hospital while recuperating from three bullet
wounds.</TE>
<TE>   If the suspect's father, 69-year-old Robert Lindblad, repeats
those claims on the witness stand, investigators say, they hope to
pull out records outlining his involvement in the 35-year-old
slayings of two men in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Lindblad's arrest and subsequent incarceration at the West Valley
Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga has caused a minor sensation
among activists in the Big Bear area, where he was known as an
anti-government agitator and major supporter of environmental
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say they may argue that California law allows them to
impeach the father's testimony when he comes to trial by showing "a
readiness to do evil" -- allowing them, in layman's terms, to argue
to a judge or jury that the father's testimony should be taken with a
grain of salt because of his past violent acts.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe the shooting of Stebbins was intentional,
and law enforcement sources said Friday that they now believe the
suspect -- Lindblad's 36-year-old son, Christian -- may have
developed a severe paranoia from extended use of methamphetamine
before the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to tell what [Robert Lindblad's] mind set was at the
time [of the 1967 Nevada slayings], and what relation it has to his
mind set in this case," said San Bernardino County Sheriff's Det.
James Cornell, who uncovered hints of the older crimes through
electronic records checks and a confidential informant. "I hope the
information can be used."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys representing the Lindblad family members either
did not return phone calls or could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors acknowledge that they will face strong opposition from
the defense team, which will contend that evidence of the 35-year-old
contract shootings would be irrelevant and unnecessarily prejudicial
in any trial on the more recent case.</TE>
<TE>   The twist in the case has, at least for now, shifted the Big Bear
Lake community's near-obsession with the case from Christian Lindblad
to his father.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Lindblad is something of a legend in Big Bear. He is
described by friends and associates as fiercely independent, a
weapons fanatic with views of the government that border on
anarchistic.</TE>
<TE>   Most days, friends say, he can be found in his small office,
chain-smoking cigarettes and drinking Jack Daniels. The office walls
are adorned with gas masks, a friend said, a less-than-subtle
suggestion to those who are offended by his heavy smoking. With his
wife, Samantha, he has lived for years in a remote, 663-square-foot
cabin with no electricity or running water.</TE>
<TE>   He is no hermit, however -- far from it. Several years ago, he
inherited the reins of a prominent nonprofit environmental
organization, the Natural Heritage Foundation, from a friend and
neighbor who was leaving town and wanted the direction of the
organization to remain local.</TE>
<TE>   Associates of Robert Lindblad say the organization has at least $2
million at its disposal, and tax returns filed with the state show
that he paid himself $39,000 a year in 1998 and 1999, but no salary
in the last two calendar years.</TE>
<TE>   Contradictions</TE>
<TE>   Robert Lindblad, who is being held on $500,000 bail, reportedly
dislikes government and abhors bureaucracy, but is immersed in both.
His organization has worked with several government agencies,
including the city of Coachella and the Big Bear Area Regional
Wastewater Agency, on a series of environmental projects.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the foundation was instrumental, according to
government records and the recollection of other area
environmentalists, in paying for and pursuing the 145-acre Stanfield
Marsh project, intended as a wetlands preserve, on the east end of
Big Bear Lake.</TE>
<TE>   There have long been rumors circulating about Robert Lindblad's
past, but when questioned by friends, he has declined to discuss the
issue, associates say.</TE>
<TE>   "It was always a suspect thing," said Erv Nichols, a Fawnskin
resident, friend and chairman of a Sierra Club chapter in Big Bear.
"He is a mysterious guy.... I would classify him as the Hunter S.
Thompson of Big Bear. He's just an iconoclastic guy. He's a character
-- but then again, we have many of them up here."</TE>
<TE>   With the new revelations, friends say they aren't sure they ever
truly knew Robert Lindblad. "I like him very much. But I didn't know
his past, and now I do," Nichols said. "I'm saddened by it, more than
anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Several environmental projects could be in trouble too. The
Heritage Foundation was being counted on, Nichols said, to pony up as
much as $200,000 for a program to build islands for rare birds near
Big Bear Lake so they would be protected from coyotes. "Now
everything's up in the air," Nichols said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the saga began when an argument broke out between
Christian Lindblad and Stebbins, his girlfriend of three years.
Stebbins, 35, had reportedly lived with the Lindblad family under a
strict set of rules, and apparently discussed leaving Christian
Lindblad and taking their young son with her.</TE>
<TE>   Christian Lindblad, authorities said, shot Stebbins in the right
hand, right leg and stomach during an argument in the home they
shared near that of his parents.</TE>
<TE>   Six Days in a Garage</TE>
<TE>   Stebbins survived, but instead of taking her to a hospital,
Christian Lindblad contacted his parents, who helped him move her to
a cot in his garage. The parents tended to Stebbins' wounds for six
days, using gauze, soap and water. By the time paramedics discovered
her -- tipped off by a Lindblad family friend, officials said --
Stebbins had nearly died.</TE>
<TE>   Stebbins is "feeling much better" and is leading "a pretty normal
life," said Cornell, the sheriff's detective. But she still suffers
from lingering effects of the shooting, and is not expected to fully
recover for another year, the detective said. She faces additional
surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   Christian Lindblad was charged in July with attempted murder,
torture and other charges, and faces life in prison if convicted,
said San Bernardino County Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Brown.</TE>
<TE>   His parents were arrested a short time later and accused of being
accessories to the shooting. They face six years in prison if
convicted, Brown said. No trial date has been set.</TE>
<TE>   The parents posted bail, but were arrested again in September on
weapons charges after an anonymous tip led investigators to two
secret rooms in their cabin. There, authorities discovered a weapons
stockpile, including, according to law enforcement documents,
blasting caps and small explosive devices.</TE>
<TE>   The parents face an additional eight years in prison on charges
related to the weapons. That case could go to trial by the end of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Now, officials say they have also discovered a new tentacle of the
case.</TE>
<TE>   According to interviews and FBI records, Robert Lindblad was
accused in a murder-for-hire case in 1967. According to law
enforcement officials, he was charged with two others in the shooting
deaths of two Wyoming men. After the charges, Robert Lindblad went
into hiding -- possibly in South America and the Sierra Nevada,
Cornell said.</TE>
<TE>   FBI spokeswoman Laura Bosley said Robert Lindblad was placed on
the agency's most wanted list after a federal fugitive warrant was
issued in the summer of 1968. He remained on the list for about three
months until he surrendered to his attorney in October 1968.</TE>
<TE>   According to a 1968 article in the Mason Valley, Nev., News, when
Robert Lindblad turned himself in, he had a "flawless handlebar
mustache," apparently to conceal his identity.</TE>
<TE>   Also described by the newspaper as "an expert in desert survival
and karate," he apparently led investigators to a shallow desert
gravesite upon his arrest on a murder charge, according to the
article.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Lindblad was handed over to the FBI and then to local
authorities. He provided evidence against his co-defendants and
therefore avoided prosecution, officials said. He moved to Big Bear
Lake a short time later.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino County officials say that, so far, they have
incomplete accounts of the 1967 shootings, and are still working with
officials in two Nevada counties to get a better picture. They said
it is a strange coincidence that Robert Lindblad was on the most
wanted list, then surfaced in connection with the Big Bear shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing started as something that his son did," Cornell
said. "He and his wife became involved as a result of that. I don't
think there was any direct planning or anything that involved them.
Their involvement in it was sheer coincidence, just because they had
a son that lived close enough to them to rely on them. And they made
the wrong choices."</TE>

<LD>Daniel Ortiz, a 15-year-old gang member accused of murder, apparently
wanted only two things for Christmas: new braces (or at least an
adjustment of the ones he already had) and a "Get Out of Jail Free"
card.</LD>
<LD>   Santa doesn't always make visits to Central Juvenile Hall, but
that wasn't a problem in this case. The Los Angeles County Probation
Department played St. Nick on Monday and made young Daniel's
Christmas merry and bright.</LD>
<LD>   Two transportation deputies gave Ortiz -- whose street name is
Capone -- a ride to his orthodontist's office in Huntington Park.
While in shackles, Ortiz gave them the slip and disappeared in a car
driven by a man with a gun, becoming the sixth lad to bust out of
Probation Department custody this year.</LD>
<TE>   Friday morning quarterbacking is easy, sure, but let's not let
that stop us. As L.A. County Supervisor Mike Antonovich emphasized
Thursday, a pattern has developed, creating a public safety risk.</TE>
<TE>   In March, a 17-year-old convicted of three counts of attempted
murder broke out of lockup by smashing a window with a computer part.</TE>
<TE>   In April, two youths clocked a driver and commandeered a Probation
Department van.</TE>
<TE>   In July, a 17-year-old convicted of an execution-style murder
produced a .45-caliber gun while in custody, locked up three guards
and fled with a convicted murderer and a convicted carjacker.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, a suspected armed robber escaped while on a medical
visit.</TE>
<TE>   And now we have Daniel "Capone" Ortiz on the lam.</TE>
<TE>   I can't tell you what went wrong in all the other escapes, but I
think I can offer a few pointers to the Probation Department based on
the Ortiz case.</TE>
<TE>   The first red flag should have been the nickname. If Daniel
"Lefty" Ortiz says he wants to go see his dentist, that's one thing.
But here, the name Capone might be a clue.</TE>
<TE>   Let's keep in mind that Ortiz was not in custody for joyriding or
boosting stereo equipment. He was accused of killing a rival gang
member this summer at Compton Avenue and 49th Street.</TE>
<TE>   An alert probation officer would have sniffed out a flight risk.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, you could have stopped any dope on the street, laid out
the situation, and he would have seen it coming.</TE>
<TE>   They have phones in Juvenile Hall, you know. So with no trouble at
all, Ortiz could have made a call to someone on the outside and said,
"You're not going to believe it, but these chumps are taking me to
the orthodontist tomorrow. The appointment is at 11. Be there."</TE>
<TE>   Before I get ahead of myself, allow me one more observation.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure that Dr. Beauchamp's Western Dental on Gage Avenue in
Huntington Park does nice work, even though a receptionist hung up on
me when I called to ask about Daniel Ortiz's dental history.</TE>
<TE>   But Ortiz didn't have an abscessed tooth, as Supervisor Antonovich
pointed out Thursday. He didn't need a root canal either, the
supervisor said with proper indignation. And even if he did, they
have dentists in Juvenile Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Was it really necessary to take this guy to his personal
orthodontist for the sake of a winning smile? Like a lot of the
questions here, this one answers itself.</TE>
<TE>   So there they are. Ortiz is in the car, the two transportation
deputies are unarmed per office regulations, and they're on their way
to Dr. Beauchamp's. I don't know if Ortiz was laughing behind their
backs, but I would have been.</TE>
<TE>   They park, they all go inside, and who would've thunk it?</TE>
<TE>   "Several patients walked in the office, creating enough of a
distraction that the minor bolted for the door," a Probation
Department spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   My understanding is that Ortiz was still shackled at the ankles,
and I'm not quite sure how anyone can bolt anywhere with his legs
bound. Nor am I sure why, given the circumstances, an armed sheriff's
deputy didn't accompany the probation officers.</TE>
<TE>   But we've already established that we're not talking about the
swiftest folks in county government.</TE>
<TE>   Slow and Slower, the glue horses who were guarding Ortiz, had to
back off when they saw the driver flash a gun.</TE>
<TE>   And just like that, Ortiz disappeared down the street for some
last-minute Christmas shopping.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know if Chief Probation Officer Richard Shumsky is cut out
for this line of work, given the year he's had, but I'll give him
this much:</TE>
<TE>   When I called to ask what on Earth is going on under his watch, he
didn't make any excuses. It's not a manpower problem or a budgetary
problem, he said. In the Ortiz case, he admitted that someone, or
several people, screwed up, and he's trying to find out who.</TE>
<TE>   There was a court order authorizing outside medical visits for
Ortiz, Shumsky said. He wasn't sure why, or whether it specified
orthodontics as one of the medical services. But if so, he said, the
order should have been challenged by his office.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there was any good reason for this youngster to see
an orthodontist," he said with resignation and maybe some
embarrassment. If Ortiz had a dental emergency that couldn't be
handled at Juvenile Hall, Shumsky added, he could have been taken to
County-USC, where there's security for inmates.</TE>
<TE>   As of the day after Christmas, Capone was still on the loose. If
you happen to see someone with a mouthful of tinsel, laughing like a
con, call the police.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>County health officials closed a small section of Newport Bay on
Thursday after about 10 gallons of raw sewage leaked from a pump-out
station hose.</LD>
<LD>   Although the spill is a relatively small one, Bayside Drive Beach
and the waters near the Harbor Patrol were closed because the water
is used by swimmers and commercial divers who clean boat hulls, said
Larry Honeybourne, chief of the Orange County Health Care Agency's
water quality section.</LD>
<LD>   The spill was discovered at 9:40 a.m. by health care workers who
routinely monitor the hoses. The station will be closed to boaters
until repairs are made today, officials said. The waters will be
closed to swimmers and divers until Saturday.</LD>

<LD>You've logged on to Windows 2002, a review of the offbeat from the
past year:</LD>
<LD>   Did they lose their tempuras? Two people reported to be snorting
cocaine in a car in Seal Beach were actually eating Japanese food
with chopsticks.</LD>
<LD>   Messy wallet woes: A suspected car thief, stopped by an L.A.
County sheriff's deputy, handed over his driver's license, which had
something stuck to the back of it -- a small baggie of cocaine (not
Japanese food).</LD>
<TE>   Strangest aerial bombing: The windshield of a driver in Los
Alamitos was cracked when a crow dropped a steak bone it had plucked
from a restaurant trash can.</TE>
<TE>   Unreal estate: The year's unique properties (see accompanying)
included some with:</TE>
<TE>   * A promise of suffering (the first mortgage bill?).</TE>
<TE>   * A promise of sex.</TE>
<TE>   * A lack of homey qualities.</TE>
<TE>   * A room apparently designed for teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Most aptly named street: John Dowsing looked up to find it in
Torrance (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Dumbest choice for a robbery: Brandishing a crowbar, a man in a
ski mask strode into a Norwalk home-improvement store and announced:
"Cash, I want all your cash." One of the would-be victims shouted,
"Let's get this guy!" The next thing the intruder knew, a hammer and
a ladder were flying his way as he slalomed out of there on the
double.</TE>
<TE>   A hole in this theory: Spotting a hose sticking out of the exhaust
pipe of an idling car, neighbors in San Juan Capistrano were worried
the 70ish owner might be committing suicide. The hose led into the
backyard, where the owner explained he was trying to gas a gopher.</TE>
<TE>   Navel battle: Residents of Orange selected "A Slice of Old Towne
Charm" for the city's slogan, rejecting such suggestions as "Nicer
Than Stanton" and "Our Navel Is Better Than Christina Aguilera's."</TE>
<TE>   New type of phone solicitation: KNX radio anchor Dick Helton was
waiting in his Jeep at a stoplight on Sunset Boulevard when a
homeless type came up to his window and asked, "Could you spare some
cell minutes?"</TE>
<TE>   Another Hollywood mess: Journalist Henk Friezer came upon a
usually neat encampment of the homeless on Beverly Boulevard and
asked the two occupants why trash was strewn everywhere. They
explained that a movie company, filming a scene about homeless
people, wanted to create a more "realistic camp." They had the real
occupants move so that catered rubble could be brought in.</TE>
<TE>   Unmanned Flying Objects Dept.: A Norwalk resident reported a plane
crashing to Earth. It turned out to be a kite.</TE>
<TE>   No jury of PC users would convict him: A man heard screaming, "I
am going to kill you!" was actually addressing his computer.</TE>
<TE>   So that's why they don't moo much: A resident called the city of
Paramount to warn that a fence should be mended "before the cows get
away." He evidently didn't notice that the cows were metal cutouts.</TE>
<TE>   Putting a new face on things: R&amp;R Studios in West L.A. sent out
invites to a "Halloween Botox Party," at which attendees could choose
among drinks and hors d'oeuvres (both free) and cosmetic surgery (not
free).</TE>
<TE>   Worst case of mistaken identity: A young man with a shaved head,
reported standing in a resident's sideyard for 10 minutes in the Los
Alamitos area, was a dummy. A nonhuman one.</TE>
<TE>   Ending on a happy note ... : A Rancho Santa Margarita man phoned
authorities to ask if his car had been repossessed and "was ecstatic
to hear it may have been stolen."</TE>

<HD>Caught in Middle of U.S.-Iran Tensions</HD>

<LD>He's a guy named Moe. He's an engineer at Honeywell, has a
10-year-old and a 13-year-old and coaches both their soccer teams in
Laguna Niguel, which is about as American suburban as it gets.</LD>
<LD>   But because Moe is short for Mohammed and because Moe Banafti is
Iranian by birth, life in these United States is not as idyllic as it
might seem. Not that he came complaining to me; I reached him through
another contact to get his assessment of what Americans know --
really know -- about that part of the world. It seemed a valid
question, given that the U.S. government asked thousands of people
from some of those countries last week to register -- and, in so
doing, caused a major flap with the large Iranian population in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Turns out Moe Banafti, 44, has lots to say -- all delivered in
measured, philosophical tones and, at times, with more than a tinge
of sadness.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like having two parents and the two of them are going at
it," he says of U.S.-Iranian ties. "If you're in the middle, you're
watching, and you're pretty much torn."</TE>
<TE>   He sees opportunities for the United States to improve relations
with Iran but wonders if it will happen. His doubts stem from my
asking how much his fellow Americans (he's a citizen) know about his
homeland. During his 27 years in America, Banafti has concluded we
don't know a whole lot and that our education probably started in
1979, when Americans were taken hostage in Tehran.</TE>
<TE>   The harm in that knowledge gap, he says, "is that those who set
policy do it in the name of the average citizen and in the name of
the ideals the citizens believe in." If the U.S. public isn't fully
informed, with a textured understanding of how Iranians or Middle
Easterners see the history of U.S. policy in that region, it can't
help shape the U.S. response abroad, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Having said that, he knows how tough it is to keep up or even to
catch up on history. "The way life is structured in the U.S.," he
says, "doesn't accord people that opportunity -- as neighbors,
friends, teammates, co-workers -- to delve into it. It takes time,
plus there are so many contradictory sources of information."</TE>
<TE>   Banafti wonders how many Americans know, for example, the various
reasons that compelled Iranians to immigrate to the United States --
it wasn't just the revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed shah,
but also the internal strife and war with Iraq that followed. These
events are part of the fabric of Iranians' modern-day views of
America, Banafti says.</TE>
<TE>   He points to former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's belated
apology to Eastern Europeans for their oppression or former President
Clinton's apology to African Americans for past injustices.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of talk -- apologizing, for instance, to the Iranian
people for past intervention in internal matters -- would go a long
way in Iran, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Banafti says he wasn't surprised or outraged by the U.S. efforts
to review the status of Iranians in America. "To be honest, I
expected it to be a little bit worse," he says. American officials
fear another terrorist attack and, unsure of how to keep the country
secure, are trying everything, he says.</TE>
<TE>   But that's another subject, and Banafti thinks even those recent
missteps could be minimized if the American public got more engaged.
If only.</TE>
<TE>   He's not holding his breath that Americans will overcome their
lack of understanding of other countries. "I have grown to accept
it," he says. "It used to bother me a lot. I would think about it a
lot. I found out I can only deal with it one day at a time. I can
only talk to so many people in a day, week or month. I'll probably go
to my grave with this issue still outstanding."</TE>

<HD>Maps Identify Area's Seismic Hazard Zones</HD>
<DH>New state documents are part of an effort to hold builders
to the same quake standards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State geologists released maps this week that for the first time
identify six seismic hazard zones in Ventura County and are part of a
statewide project to hold all builders accountable to the same
engineering standards for earthquake safety.</LD>
<LD>   The maps show areas at risk from the secondary effects of
earthquakes in Fillmore, Ojai, Oxnard, Piru, Port Hueneme and the
Rincon Beach area north of Ventura. They could clarify seismic
conditions for city planners, developers and home buyers on the
potential hazards of landslides and liquefaction.</LD>
<LD>   They are part of an ongoing project to identify seismic hazards
throughout California, especially in high-density and high-growth
areas, said Candace Hill, a land use planner with the California
Geological Survey in the state Department of Conservation.</LD>
<TE>   "The bottom line is public safety," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   The new maps identify dangers in the event of a magnitude 6.0 or
greater earthquake in the six delineated areas of Ventura County.
They show stretches of potential landslide zones in the coastal
mountains and liquefaction zones from Fillmore to Oxnard, where a
quake could turn soil saturated with water into quicksand.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been waiting for those maps," said Fillmore City Manager
Roy Payne, whose rural town in the Santa Clara Valley was hard hit by
the 1994 Northridge earthquake. "After the first of the year, we're
going to look at them and see what we need to do to respond."</TE>
<TE>   Although developers who want to build in Fillmore are required to
conduct geological tests to determine the potential for liquefaction,
the maps will help city officials decide if further steps need to be
taken, Payne said.</TE>
<TE>   The maps show that a broad liquefaction zone covers most of
Fillmore and extends from east to west through the Santa Clara
Valley. Landslide zones were identified north of Fillmore in the
Topatopa Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, which has sandy soil and a high water table, the city
requires builders to conduct soil studies and meet certain foundation
standards to prevent quake-related damage and injuries, said city
Planning Manager Marilyn Miller.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, the entire Oxnard Plain is an area of liquefaction,"
Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Liquefaction -- which makes the ground jiggle like Jell-O when
water-saturated soil is disturbed by earthquake shock waves -- caused
considerable damage in Ventura County during the 1994 Northridge
earthquake. It triggered more than 11,000 landslides in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Liquefaction zones also were found in rural Piru from the foot of
the Topatopa Mountains south to the Santa Clara River. Most of the
mountains are potential landslide hazards if an earthquake hits, the
geologists said.</TE>
<TE>   The soil in the Upper Ojai Valley also could liquefy if a sizable
earthquake hit. There, the zone was found to run along Lion Creek
from Summit School in the Upper Ojai west to Dennison Park. The same
condition was found east of Ojai along Reeves Road and San Antonio
Creek to Camp Comfort county park. A liquefaction zone also covers a
12-block area in northwestern Ojai. The mountain areas around the
valley are potential landslide hazards.</TE>
<TE>   The zone most prone to liquefaction in the low-lying Rincon Point
area is restricted to the beach and includes the small residential
communities of La Conchita, Seacliff and Faria Beach. The mountainous
terrain just inland is a landslide hazard, geologists said.</TE>
<TE>   Similar maps released by the state in 1997 for Simi Valley and
Moorpark showed some locations there could experience landslides and
liquefaction in an earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   In areas where the state identifies a hazard, builders will be
required to test the stability of the ground before getting local
approval for projects. Those tests will determine whether special
anchoring must be added to new homes' foundations to resist
earthquake damage.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of any homes in the zones must be accompanied by full
disclosure to the buyer of the seismic hazards. More than 135 cities
are using the maps in their permit process.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eager to spend holiday cash, exchange gifts and hunt for the best
bargains of the season, day-after-Christmas shoppers thronged to
Ventura County malls Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   From Ventura to Thousand Oaks, parking lots were full, lines were
long and discount bins were ravaged as shoppers took part in what is
for many an annual tradition.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, we do this every year," said 27-year-old Rosary Villegas of
Pasadena, visiting the Camarillo Premium Outlets with her mother,
Felice. "No more gifts to buy, so now I get to shop for me."</LD>
<TE>   The strong turnout was good news for area retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Although mall managers said Christmas sales were better locally
than the meager 1% nationwide increase from 2001, they did not
completely escape the overall sluggishness.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably not an excellent season, but it was a good
season," said Cris Bremner, marketing manager at The Oaks mall in
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, retailers would like to see increases greater than
they are seeing," she said. "But compared to the rest of the country,
they are doing very well."</TE>
<TE>   Final sales figures won't be available until mid-January, Bremner
said.</TE>
<TE>   During the after-Christmas rush, she said, it's likely that deep
discounts and good weather will combine to boost sales even more.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no longer all about returns," she said. "There is a lot of
spending that goes on this week."</TE>
<TE>   At Pacific View Mall in Ventura, most retailers got their
Christmas wish -- an increase in sales over last year that is
expected to exceed 13%, said marketing manager Alice Love.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason for the spike is that this is the first year
that the mall has been completely leased since its remodeling and
1999 reopening.</TE>
<TE>   Individual stores also did well, Love said. The JCPenney at
Pacific View had the highest Christmas sales in the region, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think we're in a different environment in Ventura," she
said. "I don't think the recession has hit as hard."</TE>
<TE>   There was little evidence of a gloomy economy at the outlet mall
in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Tammy Maxwell said she was at the outlets from opening to closing
on Christmas Eve doing last-minute shopping. She drove from her Los
Angeles home Thursday morning to hunt for even better bargains, but
said most stores' discounts -- ranging from 25% to 60% -- appeared to
be the same as before the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "They probably think they can fool people," she said, "but they're
not going to fool me."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it didn't stop consumers from buying, even if it meant
standing in lines that snaked through the length of some stores.</TE>
<TE>   Seasonal items -- usually marked down by at least 50% -- were a
big draw.</TE>
<TE>   Marja Graab, 69, of Camarillo, said she never misses the chance to
buy cheap Christmas cards, which she plans to use next year.</TE>
<TE>   At the Gap outlet, Oxnard resident Mary Price held a pile of
merchandise near the end of a line of about 70 people.</TE>
<TE>   She was unfazed, and even smiling.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is pretty typical," she said. "This is what you're
going to get if you venture out on the day after Christmas."</TE>

<DH>Laker star keeps plans to wed girlfriend Shaunie Nelson at
Beverly Hills Hotel a secret.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan Garvey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keeping the curious from private weddings is a common dilemma for
celebrities. But imagine trying to hide a 7-foot, 300-plus pound NBA
superstar and his wedding party.</LD>
<LD>   Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal tried to keep secret the location
of his day-after-Christmas wedding ceremony with longtime love
Shaunie Nelson. She is the mother of two of his children, and the
couple have another one on the way.</LD>
<LD>   Even guests weren't told until the last minute. All day there were
rumored locations: Malibu, Bel-Air.</LD>
<TE>   Then, from behind the manicured hedges and pink stuccoed walls of
the Beverly Hills Hotel on Sunset Boulevard came the stirring of
news: bomb-sniffing police dogs passing through the ballrooms. A band
practicing in the courtyard. White and gold tulle being draped on
stairway banisters. White roses dripping from chandeliers.</TE>
<TE>   From the side entrances, half a dozen florists' trucks unloaded
potted cherry trees blooming with white buds. And an ever-increasing
cadre of tuxedoed and dark-suited security men appeared, giving the
once-over to passersby as they took direction from unseen voices in
miniature earpieces.</TE>
<TE>   For O'Neal, who only a few months ago had said he wasn't sure when
he would be ready to marry Nelson, Thursday finally proved to be the
day.</TE>
<TE>   By 4:45 p.m., reporters clustered near Sunset and Beverly Drive
swore they saw the smiling groom behind the wheel of an outsized
Cadillac Escalade. He was followed by a stream of luxury cars
whipping up the hotel driveway: Lotus, Ferrari, Range Rover and a
caravan of limousines with blackened windows.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel is not far from the opulent home he has shared with
Nelson and the two children they had together. The couple are also
raising Nelson's son from a previous marriage. O'Neal also has a
daughter from a previous relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, young girls paraded through the lobby in
dresses they might wear to a prom. Men wore tuxedos with fancy custom
vests.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a bride coming through," a woman announced about 6
p.m., drawing the attention of patrons browsing in the hotel shops.</TE>
<TE>   A minute later, O'Neal's bride appeared, her belly showing in a
white, beaded bridal grown. She wore a long veil and an elegant
headpiece.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson was surrounded by a coterie of women dressed in the style
of the Nation of Islam. They had squared-off head coverings falling
well below their shoulders and matching long-sleeved tunics over long
straight loose skirts. One was dark crimson, another royal blue.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson was whisked down the corridor, followed by hotel security
as a handful of hotel patrons, including a couple of starry-eyed
little girls who murmured good luck, best wishes and congratulations.</TE>
<TE>   Word spread fast. Television satellite trucks staked out locations
around the hotel. Security guards watched from street corners. News
helicopters flew overhead.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was rumored to have sold the rights to cover the wedding to
a celebrity magazine, prompting guards to ask all other news
photographers to leave the hotel grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Pushed back to a Beverly Hills sidewalk, TV news crews attracted
the curious.</TE>
<TE>   Luba Morales and Al Gleichauf -- tourists from Rochester, N.Y. --
stopped to view the spectacle. "I don't like sports," said Morales,
with a shrug. "But now I know who he is. He's a Laker."</TE>
<TE>   Morales, 54, joked that the O'Neal-Nelson nuptials might finally
prompt Gleichauf, her boyfriend of many years, to tie the knot.</TE>
<TE>   "We're inspired," Gleichauf, 51, said. "Then again, we don't have
any children together. So we're not that inspired yet."</TE>

<HD>Rap Mogul Calls Arrest Bogus</HD>
<DH>Jailed 'Suge' Knight says authorities are trying to force
him to talk about homicides that he knows nothing about. He also
denies gang ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips and Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rap mogul Marion "Suge" Knight said Thursday that his arrest for
parole violations two days before Christmas is a misguided effort by
authorities to force him to talk about homicides he knows nothing
about.</LD>
<LD>   Characterizing the parole violations as bogus, he denied
allegations of involvement with gang members, except in the course of
music label business.</LD>
<LD>   "I ain't no gangster. I'm too damn old. I'm a grown man trying to
run a business," Knight said. "The guys who work for me ain't out
wearing rags and gangbanging in the streets. We got families. We got
bills. Why don't they just leave us alone?"</LD>
<TE>   In his first interview from County Jail, Knight said his arrest in
Van Nuys on Monday was a last-ditch attempt by authorities to salvage
a high-profile raid by 175 sheriff's deputies last month that has
yielded no charges and little evidence regarding a string of gang
homicides this year.</TE>
<TE>   "My parole officer asked me to stop by before the holidays, but as
I opened the door to his office, this gang investigator was standing
there who tells me they plan to put me away for a real long time if I
don't start talking," said Knight, shackled and dressed in an orange
inmate jumpsuit. "I told him, 'You better handcuff me right now.
Because I don't know a thing about it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Det. Mike Caouette, who arrested Knight, agreed that he
approached him for information about the investigation but said
Knight refused to help.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Knight's parole violations stem from his alleged
association with gang members who police believe are connected to a
series of retaliatory shootings. Under conditions of his parole,
Knight is not allowed to associate with gang members.</TE>
<TE>   "I ain't trying to start a war with the police, but they know this
ain't right," Knight said. "My mom's sick. My family's worried. Why
do this to them on Christmas Eve?"</TE>
<TE>   During the 1990s, Knight built a successful rap label, now called
Tha Row, that hired talented ex-convicts from Compton, his hometown,
and other tough neighborhoods. At one time, the company generated
$100 million a year in album sales on the strength of rap stars who
emerged from the gang culture.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Knight was convicted of assault and federal weapons
violations and was placed on probation. In 1996, he was jailed for
five years for violating probation after he and several associates,
including rap star Tupac Shakur, were recorded on videotape beating a
gang rival in the lobby of a Las Vegas hotel. Three hours later,
Shakur was fatally shot on the Las Vegas Strip. Knight was wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Since his release from prison last year, Knight has continued to
focus his company on rap music -- a musical genre, he said Thursday,
that requires him to associate with individuals from crime-ridden
neighborhoods. Knight said he consulted the parole office last
December and was assured that hiring former gang members did not pose
a problem -- as long as he didn't hang out with them after work.</TE>
<TE>   "I told parole that if I had to stop dealing with people from the
'hood, I might as well shut down my business," Knight said. "I can't
just turn my back on the people I came up with. Rap comes from the
same place that I did -- the ghetto. I've had the same employees
since I got out of prison and the parole office never said nothing.
Why, all of sudden, on Christmas Eve, do they decide to violate me
and haul me away?"</TE>
<TE>   State parole official Fernando Rios said Knight is behind bars
because he violated the strict conditions of his parole by attending
social events with gang members listed in the California gangs
identification system. During the Nov. 14 raid on Knight's homes and
business, sheriff's deputies confiscated photographs of Knight at
parties in several states with active gang members. Sheriff's
investigators said they have a photograph of Knight making a gang
sign.</TE>
<TE>   "They think anything with fingers up in the air is a gang sign,"
Knight said. "That picture is a still shot from a music video
rehearsal. One of my acts, Crooked I, was performing a song that he
wrote in honor of my best friend, Buntry, who got killed."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said one of Knight's alleged parole violations is
connected to the day eight months ago when his best friend and former
employee, Alton "Buntry" McDonald, was shot to death in Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators stopped Knight's car hours after the April
3 shooting and found him with McDonald's brother, Tim "Timmy Ru"
McDonald, an alleged member of the Mob Town Pirus.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in a business meeting when I got the call that my best
friend had got shot, so I rushed to the hospital with his brother,
who worked for me, in my car," Knight said. "Listen, I've known these
guys since I was 5 years old. I know their moms. I know their
families. What was I supposed to do? By the time we got there, Buntry
was dead. They pulled me over right after I left the hospital."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, sheriff's investigators obtained an arrest warrant for
Tim McDonald as part of a probe into a string of retaliatory
shootings linked to Alton McDonald's murder.</TE>
<TE>   Tim McDonald, who is being sought by authorities, allegedly tried
to shoot a man Oct. 22 in retaliation for the slaying of Knight
associate Henry "Hendog" Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Bob Rifkin of the Los Angeles County sheriff's anti-gang unit
said the probe into the "conspiracy to commit murder" is ongoing.
Rifkin said Knight is not a suspect at this time.</TE>
<TE>   Knight said he wonders why investigators have spent so much energy
investigating alleged retaliatory shootings tied to Alton McDonald's
murder and so little time searching for his killer.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave five years of my life to the system," Knight said. "Ain't
that enough?"</TE>

<HD>Landmark Property-Tax Suit: It's All About Doing the Math</HD>
<DH>A court will decide whether the method Orange County uses
violates Prop. 13.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco and Phil Willon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a quarter-century after California voters revolted against
soaring property taxes by approving Proposition 13, a court battle
over a single paragraph in the measure could mean thousands of
dollars in tax refunds for individual homeowners and the loss of
billions in revenue for the cash-strapped state.</LD>
<LD>   An Orange County Superior Court judge has ruled that the method
local tax assessors have used for years to set property-tax rates
violated the 1978 landmark ballot initiative. If upheld on appeal,
the decision could lead to the biggest property-tax break since the
birth of Proposition 13.</LD>
<LD>   The case boils down to a basic question: What exactly did
Proposition 13 mean when it limited increases in property assessments
to 2% a year?</LD>
<TE>   County assessors around California have one interpretation. Tax
attorney Robert Pool had another, and he filed a lawsuit against
Orange County after the assessment on his $330,000 Seal Beach home
jumped 4% in 1999. He argued the increase clearly violated the
easy-to-understand language of Proposition 13, and in December 2001
Judge John M. Watson agreed. Last week, the judge turned the case
into a class-action suit, potentially extending any tax refunds to
millions of homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   "A victory for Pool would be a victory for taxpayers statewide.
It's not the government's money. It's the people's money," said Jon
Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., the anti-tax
organization founded by Proposition 13's author, Howard Jarvis.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Coupal and other tax experts said the potential effect of
Pool's lawsuit is muddied by legal complexities, and homeowners
banking on an eventual tax refund may find themselves sorely
disappointed. Even if Pool prevails on appeal, the state Legislature
may decide how tax refunds would be dished out.</TE>
<TE>   Before California voters approved Proposition 13 in June 1978,
assessments were based on a property's "fair market value, " and the
skyrocketing housing market was triggering mammoth property-tax
increases.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13 limited annual property-tax increases to 1% of the
assessed property value and prohibited counties from increasing a
property assessment more than 2% a year. The measure also mandated
that all future tax increases would be added to a base value defined
as the purchase price or, if in the hands of the same owner since
Proposition 13 was approved, the property's assessed value in the
1975-76 tax year.</TE>
<TE>   A companion ballot initiative, Proposition 8, passed in November
1978. It refined Proposition 13 to allow property values to be
reduced in a declining market.</TE>
<TE>   The much-argued paragraph at the heart of the matter, now part of
the state Constitution, reads: "The full cash value base may reflect
from year to year the inflationary rate not to exceed 2 percent for
any given year or reduction as shown in the consumer price index or
comparable data for the area under taxing jurisdiction, or may be
reduced to reflect substantial damage, destruction or other factors
causing a decline in value."</TE>
<TE>   Under Scrutiny</TE>
<TE>   This bureaucratic prose was put under the microscope in the Pool
case.</TE>
<TE>   Pool said the language in the Constitution is clear and must be
followed: The county is prohibited from raising a resident's property
assessment by more than 2% above the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   An example is what happened to Alan Lavallee of Buena Park. Though
not involved in the Pool lawsuit, Lavallee is among those closely
watching the issue. He complains his assessment jumped an average of
more than 9% per year in the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   "No one really understands what's been happening, what the county
has been doing," said Lavallee, who believes his last property-tax
bill overcharged him by about $1,600. "The county has really screwed
up."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Assessor Webster J. Guillory and state tax officials
said the language can be interpreted differently. He said the
Proposition 13 limit on a property-assessment increases at a rate of
2% every year from the time the property is purchased. That cap
continues to rise, no matter what. And a county is allowed to
increase assessments at any rate so long as the value remains under
that cap, they contend.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a $100,000 home purchased this year can have a
maximum assessment of $102,000 in 2003; a maximum assessment of
$104,040 in 2004; a maximum assessment of $106,120 in 2005; and a
maximum assessment of $108,242 in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Even if a flat housing market forces the county to keep the home's
assessment at $100,000 until 2005, the county can increase the
property assessment to $108,242 in 2006 if the market fully recovers
-- even though that is more than an 8% increase, Guillory argues.</TE>
<TE>   "All I'm doing is following the market, and I'm following the
market back to cap," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Temporary Changes</TE>
<TE>   Lowered assessments -- allowed by the passage of Proposition 8 --
are temporary, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, assessors treat a drop in property value the same way
they treat homes damaged by a disaster. When a house is significantly
damaged, the owner can apply to have the county lower the assessment
on the property. When repairs are complete, the house is reassessed
to the value of the property before the disaster -- even if the
assessment increase is greater than 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Under Pool's interpretation of the law, Guillory argued, a
homeowner whose house is gutted by a fire would only pay property
taxes based on the assessed value of the remains, even after the home
was restored.</TE>
<TE>   The case, which is expected to head to the state 4th District
Court of Appeal this winter, is being watched closely throughout the
state. All 58 counties in California use the same method for
determining property-tax assessments. Orange County tax officials
said if the ruling is upheld and applies to all taxpayers, the county
might have to refund up to $1 billion. Los Angeles County officials
said the cost could be as high as $4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two different readings of two different clauses in the
Constitution. I don't think this is a frivolous case at all," said
Paul Steinberg, senior tax counsel for the state Board of
Equalization.</TE>
<TE>   But legal opinions are far from unanimous. Though a judge ruled
for the plaintiff in Orange County, a judge in Los Angeles County
dismissed a similar case in April. "You've got a lot of uncertainties
on this. We didn't even attempt to assess the impact," Steinberg
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if courts find in favor of the plaintiffs, the ultimate
effect is hard to predict. To begin with, California has a three-or
four-year statute of limitations on claiming tax refunds. In the
Orange County case, the judge has one final element of the case to
decide. He is expected to rule Jan. 30 on how taxpayers should be
notified that they could be due a refund. He said he will suspend his
ruling to allow the case to move ahead on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Coupal said that if the courts uphold Pool's court victory, then
every assessor in California would be inundated with claims for
property-tax refunds. To avoid that bureaucratic nightmare, the state
Legislature would probably be forced to rush in with some sort of
remedy to streamline the process, he said.</TE>

<HD>The Great Christmas Tree Toss Has Begun</HD>
<DH>Recycling is the name of the game with many waste haulers
-- and compost follows.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unwrapped presents and Christmas trees stripped of decorations mark
the end of Christmas but not the end of the pines and firs that
filled homes with holiday cheer.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of allowing trees to decay in landfills, recycling
programs throughout Orange County ensure that they will eventually
fertilize lawns and gardens.</LD>
<LD>   "A tree is a tree -- you don't want to landfill a tree," said
Bruce Shuman, chief executive of Rainbow Disposal in Huntington
Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Cities throughout Orange County began picking up trees for
recycling Thursday, and most will continue until Jan 10.</TE>
<TE>   Most trash companies, such as Waste Management -- serving Irvine,
La Habra, Laguna Beach, Lake Forest, Mission Viejo, Orange, Rancho
Santa Margarita and Santa Ana -- require that trees taller than 6
feet be cut in half.</TE>
<TE>   Solag Disposal -- which serves Aliso Viejo, Dana Point, Laguna
Hills, Laguna Niguel, San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano --
requires that that be done for 8-foot trees.</TE>
<TE>   Many trees are turned into compost, which the public can take or
buy. Solag Disposal sells compost from recycling centers but also
holds a biannual compost and mulch giveaway. Residents can pick up a
30-pound bag of compost or mulch on dates and locations specified in
the company's newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   Solag will continue recycling trees after its Jan. 17 deadline if
residents cut them up. Rainbow Disposal prefers that trees be put out
by Jan. 10 but will pull trees from regular waste and recycle them if
they are tossed in the trash after the deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management will send trees to a landfill if they are set at
curbside after Jan. 9, while Anaheim Disposal asks residents to bring
trees to its recycling station.</TE>

<HD>Audit Criticizes Zoo Fund-Raiser</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hector Becerra</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Zoo's fund-raising group failed to meet its goals,
spent money raised without consulting the zoo and paid a former
president a salary and bonus not justified by his performance,
according to an audit by the Los Angeles city controller released
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., a nonprofit group, raised less
than its goal in three of the last five years, the audit states. The
report also criticizes the association for deciding how the $7.3
million it raised over the last several years would be spent on the
zoo, rather than turning the money over to zoo officials to spend.</LD>
<LD>   The audit recommends that the city attorney be asked for an
opinion on whether the nonprofit group should repay the $7.3 million
to the zoo. But Tom Mankiewicz, the association's new board of
trustees chairman, said the expenditures had been approved by the
city.</LD>
<TE>   The zoo and the nonprofit "should be operating in concert, sharing
the same objectives and goals," Controller Laura Chick wrote.
"Unfortunately, the audit showed that the relationship was strained
to the point of hindering the effectiveness of fund-raising
activities and the ability to start construction projects."</TE>
<TE>   For a while, officials from the zoo and the nonprofit did not
communicate, David Townes, interim zoo director, said Thursday.
Referring to the association, Townes said, "GLAZA people would not be
invited to zoo staff meetings and zoo people were not invited to
GLAZA meetings. Communication had basically ceased, which is a
dangerous situation."</TE>
<TE>   One of the projects delayed by lack of funds for as long as nine
months was a gorilla habitat, which is about to go out for bids, a
zoo official said.</TE>
<TE>   The audit also criticized the association's board of trustees for
paying the group's president, Don Youpa, $175,000 last year. The
trustees also gave him a $20,000 bonus, although the association had
raised 64% less than in the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The bonus was guaranteed when Youpa negotiated his contract, and
he would have gotten it regardless of how much money he helped raise,
said Mankiewicz.</TE>
<TE>   "The bonus was a mistake," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Mankiewicz also said that positions where people are expected
to raise tens of millions of dollars must pay competitive salaries.
Youpa was considered by many an expert fund-raiser when he worked for
KCET.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless you find an incredible diamond in the rough, if you want
to pay $100,000 to $125,000 to raise this kind of money, I've been
told, you're not going to get many people," Mankiewicz said. He said
Youpa's fund-raising efforts had been complicated by the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11, which happened just a few months after he took
over, and which chilled major philanthropy everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Youpa's tenure as president ended late last summer, and he's now a
part-time consultant for the group.</TE>
<TE>   Officials for the city, zoo and association said things have
markedly improved since the audit's completion this fall. However,
they also said the relationship between the nonprofit organization
and the zoo must improve to fund upcoming, ambitious projects.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo and the association, along with the city, are
renegotiating their operating agreement to better define their roles.
The agreement could be completed in a few months, Chick said.</TE>
<TE>   "We all want what is best for the zoo," she said.</TE>

<CX>   L.A. Zoo -- An article in Friday's California section about the
conflict between the city and the organization that raises money for
the Los Angeles Zoo misspelled zoo consultant David Towne's last name

<LD>ARIZONA AT DENVER</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: Denver by 11.</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: Jake Plummer auditions in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Chances are Plummer, a free agent after this season, will be
playing quarterback somewhere besides Arizona in 2003. Chances are
Brian Griese, benched by Coach Mike Shanahan for this must-win game
for the Broncos, won't be starting in Denver in 2003. Plummer can
help himself with an upbeat performance at the end of a forgettable
season, maybe even get the Broncos interested in the process. For the
short term, Denver needs 37-year-old Steve Beuerlein to grind out a
win -- and then get enough outside help to grab a wild card. For
Beuerlein, the future is now. For Griese, the future is the bench.</TE>

<TE>   ATLANTA AT CLEVELAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Atlanta by 2 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Wild card to the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Atlanta went 7-0-1 in between losses to Tampa Bay. Cleveland
is 6-3 since mid-October. So what are the Falcons and the Browns
doing here, heading into the regular season's final weekend with
nothing clinched except holiday egg nog tainted with angst? Well, the
Falcons had a bit of a problem with the NFC North, losing to Green
Bay and Chicago. The Browns couldn't put anybody away at home, losing
games at Browns Stadium to Kansas City, Baltimore, Pittsburgh,
Carolina and Indianapolis. Cleveland has the home field Sunday.
Advantage to Atlanta.</TE>

<TE>   BALTIMORE AT PITTSBURGH</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 7 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: No paper champions here.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: In the span of four remarkable quarters Monday night,
Steeler safety Lee Flowers went from loud-mouthed loose cannon to
sage, prophet, guru and a good man to consult before your next trip
to Las Vegas. Flowers wouldn't back down from his year-old "paper
champions" assessment of the Buccaneers, much to the initial chagrin
of Steeler teammates and fans, but then there was the final score
from Tampa: Steelers 17, Buccaneers 7. The win clinched the AFC North
championship for the Steelers, who can kick back here unless the
Raiders or Titans lose and the AFC's No. 2 seeding becomes available.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Flowers Pittsburgh Man of the Year"</TE>

<TE>   CAROLINA AT NEW ORLEANS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New Orleans by 7.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Hard to go marching anywhere after you've shot
yourself in both feet.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Name an NFL playoff team that has lost games to Cincinnati,
Detroit and Minnesota (combined record: 10-35) this season. There
isn't one, which pretty much illustrates the predicament the Saints
find themselves in this weekend after back-to-back losses to the
Vikings and the Bengals. (The Detroit loss came in September, shortly
after back-to-back victories over Tampa Bay and Green Bay.) If the
Giants beat the Eagles on Saturday, the Saints will need help to
finagle the final NFC wild card. Also, Aaron Brooks (0 for his last
11 passes) had better step up.</TE>

Themselves"</TE>

<TE>   CINCINNATI AT BUFFALO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Buffalo by 7.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Will the real Drew Bledsoe make one last stand?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Eric Moulds and Peerless Price enter this game chasing
Buffalo's single-season receptions record of 94, set by Moulds in
2000. Moulds has 91 catches for 1,212 yards; Price has 89 catches for
1,195. With five more yards by Price, the Bills will become the 10th
team to feature two 1,200-yard receivers in the same season. Of
course, all of this becomes a moot point if Bledsoe doesn't shake his
late-season slump. Bledsoe had two interceptions and the Bills had
six turnovers in a 10-0 loss at Green Bay. Then again, the Bengals
provide the opposition Sunday. Should be a record-setting day in
Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Bledsoe Ends Bengal Winning Streak at One"</TE>

<TE>   DALLAS AT WASHINGTON</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Washington by 6 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Three years of Campo makes for strange bedfellows.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: While Dave Campo was drawing up his next-to-last game plan
as coach of the Cowboys last week, Dallas owner Jerry Jones was
spending five hours talking football in a less-than-top-secret
meeting with bored-legend-turned-ESPN-analyst Bill Parcells. Thus
inspired, Campo went out and lost, 27-3, at home to Philadelphia. In
the interim, what in the world can Jones and Parcells be thinking? Is
this really a matchup that cries "great long-run potential"? Would
Texas have to annex Arkansas to find enough room for both these egos?
Then again, Campo is 15-32. You know, it might be worth a try.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New York by 1.</TE>
<TE>   The slant: Home-field advantage or one more week of football? Who
wants it more?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Should the Eagles lose to the Giants on Saturday, this game
in the Meadowlands will provide a fascinating study into the human
condition. The Packers would then have the chance to clinch
home-field advantage through the NFC playoffs with a win -- and the
Packers have never lost a playoff game at Lambeau Field. But the Jets
would need to win just to keep their playoff hopes alive. Which
desire is strongest -- comfort or survival? I think we know the
answer to that, which is why the Jets are favored.</TE>

<TE>   JACKSONVILLE AT INDIANAPOLIS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Off.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Eight is enough.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Tom Coughlin winds down his eighth season as the only coach
the Jaguars have had, and it might be time for a different face
behind the whistle. Coughlin is 19-28 in the last three seasons, and
he was booed by Jacksonville fans last Sunday while a plane circled
overhead dragging a sign that read, simply, "Coughlin?" If Coughlin
is coaching for his job, the Colts are in no position to toss out any
favors. Last week's home debacle against the Giants means the Colts
must win Sunday to clinch a wild card. Unless the next six AFC
wild-card contenders also lose. Considering this season, it could
happen.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Colts Put Coughlin Out of His Misery"</TE>

<TE>   KANSAS CITY AT OAKLAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Saturday, 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Oakland by 7.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Raiders contemplate the value of home-field
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: To make the playoffs, the Chiefs must win at Oakland and
have five teams seeded ahead of them lose. (Chief offense to Chief
defense: Thanks a lot, pals.) The Raiders have a much simpler game
plan: Win and they clinch home-field advantage throughout the
playoffs. And what would that be worth? Last season, it might have
cost the Raiders the Super Bowl -- instead their championship
aspirations got buried in the New England snow. On the other hand,
Oakland had the home field in 2000 and lost the AFC final to
Baltimore. On the other hand, Tony Siragusa and Bobby Hoying are both
gone.</TE>

<TE>   MIAMI AT NEW ENGLAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pick.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The hard road, twice traveled.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Memories have faded, along with the Dolphins and the
Patriots, so deep research is required. Yes, it says here that Miami
was once 5-1 and New England 3-0 during this season. Hard to imagine
considering recent events, such as Miami losing four consecutive road
games, including two this month to Buffalo and Minnesota, and New
England unraveling at home against the Jets on national TV. The
result is this: Miami must win on the road to clinch the AFC East
title, New England must win and have Green Bay defeat the Jets to
clinch the playoffs. It should never have come to this, but that is
the AFC in 2002.</TE>

<TE>   The line: Minnesota by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The New Orleans Saints' worst enemies. Excluding the
New Orleans Saints.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Vikings and the Lions are a combined 8-22, yet they have
victories over two common opponents. Minnesota and Detroit have
beaten Chicago (join the club) and New Orleans (Jim Haslett's
December insomnia explained). If the Saints miss the playoffs, the
Vikings and Lions will at least be able to say they spoiled
somebody's season besides their own. As for this one, the Vikings are
coming off consecutive victories over New Orleans and Miami -- much
better condition than the Lions, 0-7 since Nov. 3. But the Vikings
are 1-6 on the road, giving the Lions reason to suit up.</TE>

<TE>   The line: Philadelphia by 2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Saints, Falcons, Packers will be watching with keen
interest.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Sunday assignments for the Saints, Falcons and Packers will
be set after the outcome of this one. If the Eagles win, the Packers
will have no chance for the NFC's No. 1 seeding -- the Jets are
rooting against the Giants -- and the Falcons will clinch one wild
card with the Saints going into their game against Carolina knowing a
victory will earn them the other. If the Giants win, the Packers will
play for home-field advantage Sunday against the Jets, the Giants
clinch a wild card and the Saints will be eliminated if the Falcons
win at Cleveland. A.J. Feeley, Kerry Collins: It's all yours.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Diego by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Can you spot the team still in contention?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Seattle has a young quarterback who has found his stride,
winning four of his last seven starts, including his last two in a
row. San Diego has a young quarterback who has forgotten how to make
big plays, resulting in three consecutive defeats and a 2-6 record
down the stretch. So which team is already planning for 2003 and
which is playing for a possible wild card? Amazingly, the Chargers
are the team that can still advance to the postseason -- with a win
and a lot of help. That's because the Chargers once were 6-1. But
then they hit their open date, and have looked cold and rusty ever
since.</TE>

<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Off.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Where have you gone, Eric Crouch?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: As the 49ers play out the schedule trying not get anyone
important hurt before the playoffs, the Rams would like to close a
rotten season on an up note -- meaning they find someone to play
quarterback between now and Monday. Kurt Warner is done for the
season, Marc Bulger has three compression fractures in his back and
Jamie Martin has a sore knee. Scott Covington, a Bengal reject, took
all the snaps in practice Thursday and will start if Martin can't.
After that, it's "emergency quarterback" Marshall Faulk. Good thing
the season ends Monday.</TE>

<TE>   Quick slant: Shaun King versus Henry Burriss, anyone?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Tampa Bay's Brad Johnson has an aching back. Chicago's Chris
Chandler suffered the fifth concussion of his career last week. So
what's stopping the quarterback matchup of the millennium, King
versus Burriss, which very well could send the concept of the forward
pass back 90 years? Sadly, Buccaneer Coach Jon Gruden decided to play
spoiler, announcing that Rob Johnson will start if Brad can't go.
King and Burriss both played last week. King was nine for 26 for 73
yards, his first pass intercepted and returned for a score. Burriss
was eight for 22 for 50 yards. A great, great loss for science.</TE>

<TE>   The line: Tennessee by 8 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Prodigal traitors return.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: It's better now for Houston, seeing that the city has a new
NFL team capable of great things: beating Dallas in its first game,
winning three more with a revolutionary no-offensive-line formation,
getting more players voted into the Pro Bowl than the Titans, a.k.a.
the former Houston Oilers. But Houston remains bitter about the
Oiler/Titan departure for Tennessee after 1996 and a local
entrepreneur is selling T-shirts sporting a helmet with an outhouse
logo and the inscription, "Tennessee Hillbillies -- Y'all don't come
back here, ya hear?" Oh, but they are coming. Take the Hillbillies
and the points.</TE>

<LD>The Sacramento Kings' Christmas Day victory over the Lakers signaled
an awakening and resultant power shift in the heated rivalry,
according to Sacramento Bee columnist Ailene Voisin.</LD>
<LD>   "Indeed, the bragging rights move north," Voisin wrote. "The
better team resides in Arco. Heck, the Lakers might not even be the
best team in their own building.</LD>
<LD>   " 'They are not close to the team we played in the playoffs,' King
center Vlade Divac said. It's much harder to play the Clippers. But
if we play our game, we know we can beat anybody.'</LD>
<TE>   "[The Kings] defended their lead [against the Lakers] by
continuing to attack, with their exquisite passing, movement,
shooting and solid, fundamental defense," Voisin wrote. "With their
talent. So much talent."</TE>

<HD>Georgia's Richt Gets New Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving quickly to reward its championship coach, Georgia gave Mark
Richt a new $1.5 million-a-year contract that will keep him with the
Bulldogs through at least 2010.</LD>
<LD>   The eight-year deal was announced Thursday before the third-ranked
Bulldogs arrived in New Orleans for their Sugar Bowl game against
Florida State.</LD>
<LD>   Richt, 42, a former offensive coordinator at Florida State, guided
the Bulldogs (12-1) to their first Southeastern Conference title in
two decades.</LD>
<TE>   Richt initially signed a five-year, $3.75-million contract with
the Bulldogs. After going 8-4 in his first season, he received a
one-year extension and a $50,000 raise that brought his annual
compensation package to $800,000.</TE>
<TE>   The new deal nearly doubles his salary and places Richt among the
country's highest-paid coaches. Bob Stoops reportedly makes $2
million a year, while Dennis Franchione recently left Alabama for a
six-year deal worth $1.5 million to $2 million annually at Texas A&amp;M.</TE>
<TE>   The deal includes a buyout clause of at least $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There is a conspicuous lack of Nebraska fans in Shreveport, La.,
for today's Independence Bowl game against Mississippi (6-6).</TE>
<TE>   While Mississippi nearly sold its entire 12,000-ticket allotment,
Nebraska officials estimated they'd sell no more than 6,000 tickets
to the 50,000-seat Independence Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers finished the regular season 7-6, their worst
record since they went 3-6-1 in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   "The game's only a couple days after Christmas, it's pretty far
from home and it's pretty tough to get flights in here," Nebraska
split end Ross Pilkington said. "A lot of people will watch it on TV.
We know people will still be supporting us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Southern Mississippi (7-5), already without running back Derrick
Nix, who is sidelined because of a flare-up of a chronic kidney
disease, might have to do without quarterback Micky D'Angelo today in
the Houston Bowl against Oklahoma State (7-5).</TE>
<TE>   D'Angelo sprained his left knee in the regular-season finale
against East Carolina and still is hobbled.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State (7-5) averaged 52 points over its final three
games, all victories. More than 30,000 Cowboys fans are expected to
be in attendance at Reliant Stadium, compared with about 7,000
Southern Miss fans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State had a memorable send-off for its Fiesta Bowl battle
against No. 1 Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jim Tressel got a call asking if the team buses could make a
detour through the city's business district on the way to the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably 25 [degrees] or colder, and it was amazing how
many people came out of their office buildings and so forth and were
lined along the streets," Tressel said. "That was exciting. You know,
it's a reminder that we don't just represent ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Tressel said 75 to 80 players were aboard the team's flight, while
another 25 were traveling to Phoenix from various points after
spending Christmas Day with their families.</TE>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>There has been a lot that is special about the Ducks' special teams
this season, which has a lot to do with their success.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks rank fifth in the NHL in power-play percentage at 20.1%.
They are also fifth in penalty killing at 86.2%.</LD>
<LD>   "That's the game within the game, you got to have success in those
areas," Duck Coach Mike Babcock said. "It's been real positive for
us, our power-play in particular. We're not the biggest team in the
whole world, but if your power is going good, you get bigger fast."</LD>
<TE>   Before Thursday's game, the Ducks had a power-play goal in seven
consecutive games and 13 goals in their last 39 chances with a man
advantage. Their power play ranked last in the NHL in 2001-02.</TE>
<TE>   The penalty-killing units have blanked opponents 45 of the last 49
power-play opportunities. The Ducks were seventh in penalty killing
last season at 86.1%, a team record.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as the power play gets momentum for you, so does the
penalty kill," Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left wing Kevin Sawyer, out since leaving the King game after
being knocked woozy Dec. 19, was examined by doctors Thursday, but
there was no change in his status. Sawyer has been suffering from
headaches after a fight with the Kings' Brad Norton. He won't be
allowed to travel until the headaches subside.</TE>
<TE>   Duck officials said that Sawyer is not suffering from a
concussion.</TE>
<TE>   "Once he gets cleared, he'll have to get himself skating and has
to handle the exercise," Babcock said. "Once he handles the exercise,
he's back in the lineup. We're not rushing anything here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks signed center Joel Perreault to a three-year entry-level
contract Thursday. Perreault, 19, was a fifth-round pick in the 2001
draft.</TE>

<HD>Sharks Have Ducks' Number</HD>
<DH>Anaheim doesn't look like a playoff contender in losing for
the 10th time in last 12 games against San Jose, 4-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>All those thinking about buying Mighty Duck playoff tickets, hold
your horses.</LD>
<LD>   The long faces and short answers to questions Thursday made it
clear there is work left to do on this reclamation project. Whether
this is an omen or a one-night glitch will be played out.</LD>
<LD>   There was little evidence that the Ducks have risen from the
rubble. Nor was there any indication that the San Jose Sharks are a
team in crisis. This was business as usual with a 4-1 Shark victory,
their 10th in the last 12 games against the Ducks.</LD>
<TE>   The 17,496 had to leave HP Pavilion thinking that all the talk
about the Ducks being a serious playoff contender was much ado about
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Owen Nolan, who had only two goals in his last 17 games, had two
in the second period. Goalie Evgeni Nabokov stopped 19 of 21 shots.
Teemu Selanne scored his seventh goal and 14th point in the last 11
games. The Sharks put in the time and effort on the boards.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, meanwhile, arrived from the Christmas break bearing a
few gifts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a skating team and we didn't do that tonight," Coach Mike
Babcock said. "Christmas break is over. They executed. We looked a
step slow."</TE>
<TE>   That was never more evident than on the goal that put the game in
the Sharks' back pocket.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had an opportunity to get back into the game late in the
second period. Trailing, 2-0, Matt Cullen's one-man act cut the
deficit in half. He dug the puck out of the corner, slipped through
two Shark defenders and whipped a shot past Nabokov at 18 minutes 11
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   All that hard work was wiped out in a farcical moment 24 seconds
later. Defenseman Ruslan Salei lost control of the puck in front of
the net. Marco Sturm picked it up for the Sharks and Salei tried to
make up for the mistake by hacking at Sturm from behind. All he
managed to do was to hit Sturm's stick, which sent the puck trickling
on net and between the legs of goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, teams get lucky," Salei said. "We have scored some
lucky goals recently. I don't know how he got it in. It's my fault,
but we were unlucky."</TE>
<TE>   And before the Ducks could say "Huh?" the game was lost.</TE>
<TE>   "We got to get off vacation," team captain Paul Kariya said. "We
played horrible. That was probably our worst game of the year."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks went into their three-day Christmas break one of the
hottest teams in hockey, winning six of seven games. Their special
teams were sharp. Giguere had four shutouts in the previous six
games.</TE>
<TE>   Then post-holiday blues took over.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a bad night," Giguere said. "I have to make the first save.
All four of their goals were on the first shot."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are 1-6-2 against Pacific Division teams, with their
only victory coming against last-place Phoenix. They are winless in
two games against the Sharks and are 0-2-1 against the Kings, two
teams that the Ducks are competing with for a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   Three days off seemed to take some steam out of the Ducks' recent
hot streak and they were fortunate to get out of the first period
with a scoreless tie. The Sharks were dominating and that became
clear in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Nolan got the puck at the blue line and skated past the Ducks'
most reliable defenseman, Keith Carney, who fell down. That allowed
Nolan a free lane to the net. He faked, waited, then slipped a
backhand shot past Giguere for a 1-0 lead 2:16 into the period.</TE>
<TE>   Nolan made it 2-0 by burying a slap shot midway through the
period.</TE>

<HD>Death Awakens Soccer World</HD>
<DH>Since coroner ruled that English great Astle died because
of continuous heading of old, heavy leather ball, concern grows for
other victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Wallace</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Jeff Astle was known in the 1960s English soccer world as a player
who was "good in the air," a forward whose ability to out-jump
defenders and head the ball into the net made him one of the great
goal scorers of his era. Former teammates at West Bromwich Albion in
Birmingham remember him as a brave, powerful athlete, and long after
he'd retired, fans still hailed him on the city's streets as "the
King."</LD>
<LD>   Yet when he died last January at 59, after a four-year illness,
Astle couldn't remember anything about the game he loved, or even the
names of his grandchildren.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, a coroner ruled it was heading the soccer ball that
had killed him.</LD>
<TE>   "There was evidence of soft trauma to the brain from continual
heading of a heavy football," said South Staffordshire coroner Andrew
Haigh, who'd ordered the inquiry into Astle's death.</TE>
<TE>   All those balls bounced off his forehead and toward the net or the
feet of teammates were, it turns out, like taking jabs in the head to
a boxer.</TE>
<TE>   The coroner's ruling was registered as "death by industrial
disease," but the implications for the sport in Britain are
potentially more dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   It marks the first time any legal ruling has linked heading a
soccer ball and degenerative brain disease. No one knows how many
soccer old-timers are living out their years in the fog of damaged
brains but the anecdotal evidence suggests Astle was not a rare case,
and professional soccer is only now realizing it may have a big
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh there are quite a number of footballers who died of it," said
Tom Finney, 80, one of the legends of English football.</TE>
<TE>   Finney ticks off the names of some who ended their days suffering
from Alzheimer's-like symptoms. And he repeats the conventional
wisdom that the old, heavy leather balls the game once used are to
blame.</TE>
<TE>   "Now Willie Cunningham, if he headed that ball, he used to pass
out," Finney said.</TE>
<TE>   The sport's establishment accepts the heavy-ball theory, noting
that current synthetic balls are lighter and -- crucially --
engineered to be water repellent. Astle was part of a generation that
played with a ball that took on water as it rolled along wet grass.
The sodden ball would as much as double its one-pound weight by late
in a game.</TE>
<TE>   Those who played with the old leather recall it with dread.</TE>
<TE>   "On a wet day, just kicking it was bad enough," said Willie
O'Neill, who played with Glasgow Celtic in the mid-1960s.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill just laughed when asked if he'd been a big header of the
ball.</TE>
<TE>   "The name of the game is football," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Recalled Barry Fry, 58, a teammate and friend of Astle, "You had
loads of concussions in those days, but we just gone on with it,
really. Those old [fields] didn't drain well and sometimes we'd play
through six inches of mud and muck. That laced ball would cut your
forehead, cut your eye if you caught it wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Since the ruling on Astle's death, there have been numerous
attempts to describe what it felt like to head a leather ball. A bag
of bricks is the most popular analogy. A half-ton of impact, offered
one ballistics expert.</TE>
<TE>   "Think of someone heaving a bag of potatoes toward you, then you
rise to meet it while twisting your neck to redirect it," said
professor David Graham of the Institute of Neurological Sciences in
Glasgow, one of Britain's leading authorities on brain injuries.
"Because you have one or both feet off the ground, you're not stable,
so it may cause the brain to move inside the head.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the movement of the brain against the skull that causes the
damage," Graham said. "Even if you meet the ball head on, the brain
will still move."</TE>
<TE>   Before thousands of soccer moms and dads dissolve in panic, Graham
points out that he isn't drawing any firm conclusion on whether
heading the ball leads to cognitive impairment in later life.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd have to test for other factors, such as whether the
lifestyle of the post-career athlete enhances their predisposition to
changes in the brain," he said, a diplomatic reference to the
hard-living ways of English soccer.</TE>
<TE>   The style of play also has changed, with the ball played much more
along the ground than in the air these days. In retirement, Astle
would watch games on television and complain that players would not
go up for the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff would go, 'Ah, they're frightened of messing their hair up
now, they don't want to move the gel along,' " said his widow,
Laraine Astle.</TE>
<TE>   But with compensation lawyers warming up their briefs on the
sidelines, the game's authorities are taking a harder look at the
health implications of heading the ball.</TE>
<TE>   England's Football Assn., while expressing sorrow but no
culpability for what happened to Astle, commissioned a study last
year into the effects of heading. Thirty young players identified as
having good prospects for long careers are participating in tests
that will measure any changes to their brains over the next 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   But some science on the subject already exists. Norwegian
researchers first detected a problem in 1989, when a study of 33
members of their national squad found one-third suffering from
"central cerebral atrophy." A wider Norwegian survey three years
later discovered 80% of an even bigger sample of active and retired
players showed at least mild neuropsychological impairment, described
as headaches, dizziness and irritability.</TE>
<TE>   They also had a "significantly higher incidence and degree" of
spinal damage than the rest of the population.</TE>
<TE>   "So what?" goes one school of thought. All high-performance
athletes are pushing their bodies to extremes and doing damage in the
process. How does heading a soccer ball stack up against the health
risks of, say, the use of steroids or the helmet-to-helmet impact in
American football?</TE>
<TE>   After all, according to one report, more people are killed in
soccer by poorly anchored goalposts falling on them than from heading
the ball. And kids are now playing with a smaller, lighter ball,
making it a safer game -- even if the American Youth Soccer
Organization did narrowly reject a proposed rule change last year
that would have banned heading for players under 10.</TE>
<TE>   Yet with manufacturers bragging that their labs produce a modern
soccer ball that can be kicked at up to 114 mph, perhaps players are
entitled to full disclosure before they decide to stick their brain
in front of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff never thought about it, it was his job," Laraine Astle said.</TE>
<TE>   She met her future husband when they were teenagers and they were
married for 38 years. She wept as she told how, over four years of
wasting health, he turned from a "happy-go-lucky man with a marvelous
memory" into a restless invalid, angry and unaware what was wrong
with him.</TE>
<TE>   "More than half his goals were scored with his head because he
knew how to do it properly; he always hit it in the right place," she
said proudly. "He was the best header in the game. And now he's gone
and can't see his grandchildren, because football killed him."</TE>
<TE>   The coroner's verdict has given her something to hang onto.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people in the game who would like this swept under the
rug but they can't pretend anymore," she said. "I won't let it go
away. I want to know what football is going to do about it."</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler / ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Ring. Ring. Ring. Anyone Home?</HD>
<DH>After three consecutive championships, Lakers learning
their best may not be good enough anymore</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having taken their long-awaited reality check and failed it, the
11-19 Lakers now enter a state, which was always out there but never
actually experienced in the three-plus years of their dynasty:</LD>
<LD>   Desperation.</LD>
<LD>   More could be in peril than just the season. A December loss is
never actually devastating but this is a group that barely withstood
prosperity, winning its three titles amid constant wrangling.</LD>
<TE>   What will happen now when they have to fight through four months
of grinding adversity, which might not have the usual happy ending?</TE>
<TE>   In what might have been a (tiny) sign that they're pulling
together, the players asked Coach Phil Jackson, who would have given
them the day off, if they could get together Thursday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it wasn't that big a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to get out of the house," said Jackson. "You know,
they've probably got guests and company ... "</TE>
<TE>   So, other than Shaquille O'Neal's wedding, which reminded them
that life goes on and is even bigger than basketball, things didn't
look a lot better for the Lakers, as far as their jobs went, the day
after.</TE>
<TE>   Christmas certainly looked devastating. On the Lakers' own floor,
the Sacramento Kings took their best shot and brushed them aside like
ants. Even Kobe Bryant, whose confidence and denial mechanisms are up
there, said flatly that the Lakers had played well, meaning they
(gulp) weren't good enough.</TE>
<TE>   The day after, someone asked a subdued Rick Fox, with a new year
coming, shouldn't it be out with the old and in with the new?</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be careful with that," said Fox, grinning. "At my age, I
don't qualify as young."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it as simple as making one cut and throwing the ball to
Shaq and Kobe anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is still trying to get Bryant calibrated (that's not
enough shots, oops, that's too many) and Shaq isn't up to carrying a
franchise at present.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson shook up things further on Christmas, musing that O'Neal
might never have his old explosion, but said Thursday he thinks Shaq
is better than he was last season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, O'Neal scored 41 and 35 points in Games 6 and 7
against the Kings in the playoffs but he wasn't close to that man on
Christmas. In any case, Jackson says Shaq will need a lot more help.
Now, it's rally 'round their big guy.</TE>
<TE>   "I just know he's working real hard in all aspects to get his game
to 100%," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's giving us the best kind of effort that he can give and
that's good.... You have no gripes, no hopes, no anticipations that
he's going to be playing at another level and elevate his level from
what he's at.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm asking is for the other players who play around him to
play at another level. Kobe's defense, you know he's an all-defensive
player. His ability to take good, quality shots.</TE>
<TE>   "Rick's ability to be an offensive threat and do some things with
the basketball that create penetration and assists.</TE>
<TE>   "Derek Fisher's shooting and his choice of shots and his ability
to make the right decisions ... has to improve.</TE>
<TE>   "Samaki [Walker] has got to stay within the offense and understand
what the triangle's all about....</TE>
<TE>   "Rob [Horry] has to give us a little bit more than a lick and a
promise, even if he physically is not ready to play or not physically
100% every night. He's got to give more to the team defensively than
he has or been able to lately.</TE>
<TE>   "Our bench guards have to come in and give us a lift. Our
short-term backup players have to do the job they can do. Slava
[Medvedenko] come in and score, Mark Madsen rebound and defend.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes on and on, down the line."</TE>
<TE>   This season, it hasn't been going at all, which has been the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   There are other things they have done in the past that won't be
helpful under present conditions, either.</TE>
<TE>   Like: How about knocking off the finger-pointing?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they're used to doing it but now it's an indulgence
they can no longer afford.</TE>
<TE>   How about knocking off the "trade speculation" that's really just
wishful thinking?</TE>
<TE>   The reality is that any "deal" you hear about, in which the Lakers
get a starting player, is nonsense, as is any "deal" in which Bryant
is moved. No cavalry will be riding over the hill in the form of
Latrell Sprewell or Bonzi Wells.</TE>
<TE>   How about knocking off the feud stuff, at least until you're good
enough to hold up your end of the rivalry?</TE>
<TE>   It's borderline amusing when they win but dishonors them now.</TE>
<TE>   Teammates urged Fox not to shake Doug Christie's hand, to preserve
some kind of psych or mental edge, although it didn't turn out to be
that important, did it?</TE>
<TE>   This season, the Lakers may have to show they can lose with as
much grace -- OK, more would be good -- as they won with, rather than
going the way of the 1991 Detroit Pistons, who walked off the court
in the closing seconds while being eliminated by the Chicago Bulls,
to their everlasting shame.</TE>
<TE>   Any of you guys up for a little desperation?</TE>
<TE>   At this very early but very low point, nothing less will do.</TE>

<HD>Groundbreaking Win for Krone in Malibu</HD>
<DH>Jockey is the first woman to win a Grade I race at Santa
Anita, guiding 26-1 longshot Debonair Joe to victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Julie Krone had one more mount, in a race that would be run in about
20 minutes, but she was in no hurry to leave the winner's circle. The
jockeys' room and a change of silks could wait. Pictures? Take as
many as you want. Interviews? Just hand her the microphone. Hugs and
handshakes? She had a million of them.</LD>
<LD>   Krone's comeback, launched Nov. 1 at the same Santa Anita track,
reached an apex Thursday when the 39-year-old Hall of Fame jockey
rode Debonair Joe to an unlikely victory in the opening-day Malibu
Stakes before a crowd of 25,677. Debonair Joe was 26-1, the biggest
upset in Malibu history, and until Krone returned to the saddle,
after 3 1/2 years away, the odds on a woman winning a Grade I race at
Santa Anita had been in the millions.</LD>
<LD>   Which is to say, it had never been done before. Not at Santa
Anita, or any other track in California. Mainly because there has
never been a welcome mat for female riders. What few to come this way
have trudged off in frustration, unable to build a steady business,
far from getting assignments in major stakes. The more accomplished
female riders, paying attention, stayed in the East. Krone included.</LD>
<TE>   Krone is not one to delve into the gender thing, but even she was
staggered by the enormity of Thursday's feat. As she floated from the
winner's circle to the changing room, the ninth race one of the
furthest things from her mind, she said: "Other than the Belmont,
I've never been this excited about anything."</TE>
<TE>   At the time she re-opened a career that had produced 3,545
winners, the pinnacle had been winning the 1993 Belmont Stakes with
Colonial Affair. The Belmont is the Belmont, but for the cherry on
top she had also been the first woman to ever ride a winner in a
Triple Crown race.</TE>
<TE>   She had warmed up for this at the recent Hollywood Park meet,
riding 16 winners to finish seventh in the standings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little wild about this," she said. "There are a lot of
emotions that are running through me. You can't imagine what a
feeling it is to be in the stretch with a horse that's just pulling
you to the front."</TE>
<TE>   Not that long ago, Debonair Joe was more a candidate to be pulling
a wagon. The 3-year-old gelding, once a contender in some of the
better races for California-breds, had sunk this year to
bottom-of-the-barrel claiming company, and in September at Fairplex
Park had been bought from trainer Craig Lewis for $12,500.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Juan Pablo Silva, who made the claim, risked losing him
three times, for prices of either $28,000 or $40,000, but nobody was
interested, even though he started winning -- at Santa Anita in
October and again at Golden Gate Fields last month. When Silva hired
Krone to ride him for the first time, Debonair Joe won the Grade III
Vernon O. Underwood at Hollywood Park on Dec. 7. The $2 win mutuel
was a whopping $107.60. Thursday's payoff was $55.60.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess this is the reason they go ahead and run these races,"
said trainer Wayne Lukas, who saddled another longshot, Shah Jehan,
who finished next to last in the 11-horse field.</TE>
<TE>   At the half-mile mark, Debonair Joe was in eighth place. At the
eighth pole, he was fourth, three lengths from the front, but well
wide with no horses to block his path.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a horse that knows where the wire is," Krone said. "I've
worked him fast and I've worked him slow. You just have to let him do
what he wants to do. That's what keeps him happy."</TE>
<TE>   Total Limit finished second, beaten by a head, and American
System, one of the pace-setters, was third, another half-length back.
For his sixth victory in 18 starts, Debonair Joe earned $120,000,
running seven furlongs in 1:22 2/5. Sunday Break, the 5-2 favorite,
was close to the early pace before finishing last.</TE>
<TE>   The day Silva claimed Debonair Joe, for Lynne Ristad of Pismo
Beach, the horse finished fifth in a six-horse field.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lucky claim," Silva said. "The horse has been improving
and improving."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Delahoussaye, the Hall of Fame jockey who has been sidelined
for four months, said that he will retire if he doesn't receive
approval from his doctors to resume riding in mid-January.</TE>
<TE>   Delahoussaye, 51, suffered the fifth concussion of his 36-year
career in a spill at Del Mar on Aug. 30 and has been getting therapy
for a sore neck ever since. He is scheduled to undergo an MRI on Jan.
13.</TE>
<TE>   "If they won't release me, I'm just going to hang it up,"
Delahoussaye said.</TE>

<KH>ORANGE BOWL: USC vs. IOWA Thursday, 5 p.m., Channel 7</KH>
<HD>House-Swarming Party for Trojans</HD>
<DH>Home near campus rented by eight players has become the
team's unofficial headquarters</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. -- A soft ocean breeze wafted through the grounds of
USC's posh beachfront hotel here Thursday night as the Trojans
checked in for an eight-night stay in the lap of luxury.</LD>
<LD>   USC's Orange Bowl headquarters feature all the amenities typical
of a four-star resort, including three opulent swimming pools, soft
10-layer beds, championship golf and tennis facilities, a spa and
marble floors and accents throughout.</LD>
<LD>   Those accouterments, however, cannot duplicate the simpler
comforts of home.</LD>
<TE>   And if home is where the heart is, then the heart of this season's
Trojan team resides in a creaky but comfortably collegiate
106-year-old house in Los Angeles' historic West Adams district.</TE>
<TE>   Co-captains Carson Palmer and Troy Polamalu are among eight
players who live in the two-story house that has been converted into
a five-bedroom abode affectionately known to all Trojans by its
street address, "Ten-Thirteen."</TE>
<TE>   1013.</TE>
<TE>   The number is as recognizable to USC players as the No. 3 stitched
on the jersey of their Heisman Trophy winning quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, a fifth-year senior, and running back Malaefou MacKenzie,
a sixth-year senior, were among the five original Trojan tenants who
answered an ad in the campus newspaper and moved into the house three
years ago. The current lineup also includes Polamalu, flanker Keary
Colbert, offensive linemen Lenny Vandermade and Norm Katnik,
quarterback Matt Cassel and senior receiver Grant Mattos.</TE>
<TE>   But the house, located about a mile from campus, serves as a
hangout and crash-pad for any player who drops by.</TE>
<TE>   "The house seems to be the epicenter of the whole team," Polamalu
said.</TE>
<TE>   Like the house, the Trojans' 10-2 season was built on a strong
foundation. Vandermade calls 1013 "a beehive of leadership," though
no one follows, much less knows, the rules of Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Camaraderie developed during domino games on the wraparound porch
that features a couch, a couple of easy chairs and a two-seat swing.
Nightly video-game battles in the living room honed competitive
skills. On occasion, players even retired to a front-yard rose garden
for contemplative conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a big party group, just a good group of guys," Colbert
said. "We've got someone living there from almost every unit. So if
something is said at home that needs to be brought to the team, it's
easily done."</TE>
<TE>   The house, built in 1896, is one of 11 Victorian- and
Craftsman-style homes in the West Adams area owned by Edward and Ann
Dorr. The Dorrs, fourth-generation USC alumni, buy distressed
properties, revitalize them and then rent them to USC students.</TE>
<TE>   One address, four example, houses drama students. Engineering
students live in another. Then there's 1013, located right next door
to the Dorrs' landmark Victorian.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a nice group of kids," Ann Dorr said of her neighbors.
"They had a great big party there a few years ago and about 150
people showed up. But other than that, there's never been a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Not outwardly, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Before this season, residents at 1013 endured trying times on the
field and also at home.</TE>
<TE>   "We went through some serious stuff at the house," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, MacKenzie and former Trojan fullback Charlie Landrigan,
linebacker Zeke Moreno and receiver Matt Nickels were the first
football players who lived at 1013.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember one night, I was home alone and I heard this sound
coming from the kitchen," Landrigan recalled. "I got up and poked my
head in there and saw a rat.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a few of those. There's nothing funnier than seeing a
bunch of football players refusing to pick up a full rat trap."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the living room -- or the half of the room that was not
turned into Palmer's bedroom -- features a big-screen TV for sporting
events and a smaller set exclusively for video games.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always so cozy.</TE>
<TE>   After the 2000 season, bill paying lagged because Moreno moved out
and none of the players was certain about who was responsible for
utilities. Or, as Landrigan said, "We kind of got caught up in other
things." The result: residents at 1013 played all of last season
without heat or hot water, circumstances that continued through last
winter.</TE>
<TE>   The temperatures, combined with hardwood floors and thin window
panes, produced chilly conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "It was freezing in there -- I don't think anyone in the house had
lived like that," said Colbert, who grew up in Oxnard and moved in a
year ago, after the Las Vegas Bowl. "We all came from decent homes,
decent families."</TE>
<TE>   Said Palmer, whose family lives in Laguna Niguel: "We always had
hot water and we didn't have rats. It was definitely a change for
me."</TE>
<TE>   As winter turned to spring, Katnik could no longer take the cold
air and water temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, I said, 'The heck with it,' and put it in my name."</TE>
<TE>   With one signature, the fortunes of the house changed.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the big turnaround for 1013," Cassel said.</TE>
<TE>   For the Trojans as well.</TE>
<TE>   Warmed in body and spirit, USC put together its best regular
season since 1988 and earned its first berth in a bowl championship
series game.</TE>
<TE>   Almost two weeks ago, seven residents of 1013 gathered in the
living room with more than a dozen teammates and other friends to
watch the Heisman Trophy announcement.</TE>
<TE>   On the big-screen TV, they saw Palmer sitting nervously in the
front row at the Yale Club in New York.</TE>
<TE>   When Palmer was announced as the winner, the reaction shook the
walls and the rafters at 1013.</TE>
<TE>   "We just dog-piled right there in the middle of the room," Katnik
said.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction reverberated across the country. A few hours after
winning the award, Palmer was asked where he planned to keep the one
of the most famous statuettes in sports.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably 1013," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The trophy wound up at Palmer's parents' house, but Colbert said
the legacy of the player who won it would live on at 1013 after he
leaves to begin his professional career.</TE>
<TE>   Teammates are already jockeying to replace Palmer, Polamalu,
MacKenzie and Mattos when there is a vacancy.</TE>
<TE>   "We've helped restore some of the tradition to the USC program
this season," Colbert said. "I guess we have to keep it going at
1013."</TE>

<HD>Raising the Barr</HD>
<DH>Linebacker was on the ground floor of Hawkeyes' rebuilding
project</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>IOWA CITY, Iowa</DL>
<LD>Outside, a winter chill sweeps over the sprawling University of Iowa
campus. But inside the football team's bubble-domed practice
facility, senior linebacker Fred Barr is generating plenty of hot
air.</LD>
<LD>   Surrounded by a dozen reporters, Barr lives up to his reputation
as the blowhard of the Big Ten by questioning the toughness of USC,
Iowa's opponent in the Orange Bowl on Thursday, and saying Hawkeye
quarterback Brad Banks should have won the Heisman Trophy instead of
USC's Carson Palmer.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing personal, mind you. That's just the way Barr sees things,
and if you don't agree, that's fine. Teammates say he doesn't care
what others think of him.</LD>
<TE>   Barr figures he can back up his comments on the field. The
four-year starter leads Iowa with 109 tackles this season and ranks
fourth on the school's all-time list with 371.</TE>
<TE>   He's also the unofficial leader of the 12 Florida natives on the
Hawkeye roster, a position he earned by being the first Floridian to
buy Coach Kirk Ferentz's pitch that the Midwest has much to offer
young men from the sunshine state. Barr signed with Iowa in December
1998, only weeks after Ferentz replaced retiring Hayden Fry.</TE>
<TE>   "I just saw an opportunity to take a program that was going down
and build it back up," said Barr, who was not recruited by his home
state's big three -- Florida, Florida State and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Barr was an undersized linebacker at South Plantation High in Fort
Lauderdale, but he has grown into a 6 foot 2, 240-pound anchor for a
defense that ranks second nationally in rushing yards given up, 68.2
a game.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Barr signed with Iowa, the Hawkeyes received
commitments from his South Plantation teammate, defensive tackle
Colin Cole, and receiver Maurice Brown of Fort Lauderdale's St.
Thomas Aquinas High.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that Barr and Cole are All-Big Ten selections, and
that Brown has tied an Iowa record with 10 touchdown receptions this
season, it's safe to say Ferentz fared well with his first recruiting
class from Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that our first two recruits, Colin Cole and Fred Barr,
have been All-Big Ten performers, I think that's given us good ammo
down there with recruiting," Ferentz said. "Both are getting their
degrees. It's been a win-win story for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Other Floridians who have flourished at Iowa include Heisman
runner-up Banks and starting receiver C.J. Jones, cousins who signed
with the Hawkeyes after playing at out-of-state junior colleges. Five
Iowa starters are from Florida. Brown, who doesn't start but plays a
lot as the No. 3 receiver, leads the team in catches.</TE>
<TE>   "Naturally, we're going to keep going down there to keep that
pipeline going," Ferentz said.</TE>
<TE>   Barr appreciates the good times because he has been through the
bad. As a freshman, Iowa was 1-10 overall and 0-8 in the Big Ten.
Three years later, the Hawkeyes are 11-1 and 8-0.</TE>
<TE>   "It has definitely been a fun ride," Barr said.</TE>
<TE>   And it keeps getting better. One of the most joyous -- and
improbable -- holiday homecomings occurred Thursday, when the
Florida-bred Hawkeyes arrived in Miami with their teammates to begin
final preparations for the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "Never in my wildest dreams," Barr said. "The Rose Bowl, yes, but
never the Orange Bowl. I'm very excited."</TE>
<TE>   Judging by his comments, Barr doesn't intend to end his college
career with a defeat. Of USC, he said: "They've got very talented
people, but they're missing the physical aspect that we bring to the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing in the Big Ten, we're pounding every week. I don't think
they play that kind of football out there in the Pac-10."</TE>
<TE>   If the Trojans are offended by that observation, they'll have to
get in line. Barr has been speaking his mind about opponents for some
time.</TE>
<TE>   Of Michigan's hallowed tradition, Barr said: "It doesn't mean
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Before playing cross-state rival Iowa State, Barr said: "I hate
those guys. I can't stand them."</TE>
<TE>   The comments have provided plenty of bulletin-board material, but
Ferentz avoids playing the role of team censor.</TE>
<TE>   "If you say you don't like the opposition, well, why would you?"
Ferentz said. "That's stating the obvious there."</TE>
<TE>   For a while, Barr even hated Iowa, particularly the frigid
winters. He considered transferring.</TE>
<TE>   "But every kid goes through that, especially being so far from
home," he said. "The weather is so cold. I'm not used to wearing a
jacket every day [before] summer. It's a change, but you get used to
it."</TE>
<TE>   Cole, Barr's former high school teammate, also came close to
bolting from Iowa. During his freshman season, he talked to another
school about transferring.</TE>
<TE>   "It came down to the fact that I made a decision to come here,"
said Cole, who leads Iowa with 16 tackles for losses. "I felt if I
turned back, I'd be missing out on something eventually."</TE>
<TE>   Another Fort Lauderdale native is missing out. Starting cornerback
Benny Sapp was kicked off the team by Ferentz after he was arrested
Aug. 4 and charged with disorderly conduct and public intoxication.
That was a month after Sapp had been involved in an incident in which
he was stabbed at a bar, suffering a minor injury.</TE>
<TE>   Ferentz said Sapp "probably crossed the line one too many times,"
but the player's dismissal threatened to upset the chemistry of
Iowa's tight-knit group of Floridians. Sapp, a cousin of Tampa Bay
Buccaneer defensive lineman Warren Sapp, had played with Barr and
Brown in the highly regarded Lauderdale Lakes youth football program.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of Sapp's dismissal, Barr said: "I don't want to
disagree because it's Coach Ferentz's decision. If it was me, I feel
I would need him."</TE>
<TE>   Barr still acknowledges that the incident was painful, but it
helped that Sapp was able to stay close after transferring and
playing for Northern Iowa this season. "He's right down the road,"
Barr said. "He still comes around to hang out."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the incident, Iowa's Florida connection appears strong.
Abdul Hodge, a redshirt freshman from Fort Lauderdale, probably will
replace Barr next season. Among the Hawkeyes' 14 high school
commitments is one from Florida, and Iowa is recruiting four other
Florida preps, Ferentz said.</TE>
<TE>   If things had worked out different, Iowa would have one of USC's
top players. But receiver Mike Williams, a freshman from Tampa, Fla.,
turned down the Hawkeyes.</TE>
<TE>   The number of Florida players on Iowa's roster has created a
potentially difficult situation in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are the guys I have to watch," Ferentz said. "They have all
the friends down there."</TE>
<TE>   Barr, who has disagreed with his coaches before, says there's no
need to be concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [Ferentz] will have to worry more about the Iowa guys,"
Barr said. "Not coming from [Florida], they don't know the real
atmosphere, how to react in certain situations."</TE>
<TE>   And what should the Iowans expect?</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of beautiful girls," Barr said.</TE>

<LD>Jason Allison and the Kings knew there would be days when the
point-a-game center would not be able to play because of knee
stiffness. After all, Allison did return to the lineup a month early
following a right knee injury on Oct. 29.</LD>
<LD>   "His knee has been stiff after every game," Coach Andy Murray said
about Allison, who did not play against Phoenix Thursday night at
Staples Center. It was the second consecutive game that Allison sat
out after playing nine games in a row once he rejoined the Kings on
Dec. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Allison had an MRI exam Thursday, which revealed that he
aggravated his sprained medial collateral ligament. He's listed as
day to day.</LD>
<TE>   Murray said that it's important for the Kings to continue to play
their game as if Allison were still in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that we're missing one of our better players and without
him, there's more of a challenge for us offensively," Murray said.
"But we don't change our game no matter who's in the lineup."</TE>
<TE>   In 18 games, Allison has five goals and 24 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adam Deadmarsh, sidelined the last two weeks because of an
undetermined ailment, possibly related to an early season concussion,
did not play against the Coyotes but did work out with his teammates
Thursday morning.</TE>

<HD>Overtime Is Right Time for Chartrand</HD>
<DH>With Potvin struggling, King forward scores in the extra
period, leading L.A. past Phoenix, 4-3</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a game that seemed destined to end in a tie, Kings' forward Brad
Chartrand had a different finish in mind Thursday night at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   With a flick of the wrist from the top of the left faceoff circle,
Chartrand gave the Kings a 4-3 overtime victory in front of a
record-breaking crowd of 18,738, the team's 10th sellout of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   "At the end of a game like that, you're not looking for anything
fancy," said Chartrand, who has three goals over his last three
games, including two in a victory over the Mighty Ducks.</LD>
<TE>   Chartrand's goal ended a mediocre effort from the Kings, who added
another body to their injury list in the second period when Bryan
Smolinski had to leave the game with an eye injury. He's listed as
day to day.</TE>
<TE>   With Jason Allison, Adam Deadmarsh and Aaron Miller heading the
Kings' group of injured players, Coach Andy Murray was pleased to
pick up two points, but not with how his team played down the
stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, we had a lead in the third period and we let it get
away," said Murray, whose team ended a two-game overall losing streak
but extended their home winning streak to four.</TE>
<TE>   The Christmas break seemed to agree with Kings early when they
opened the scoring 98 seconds into the first period. Although he
never touched the puck with his stick, rookie Michael Cammalleri got
credit for the goal because of a little luck.</TE>
<TE>   From the left wing, Mikko Eloranta gathered in an Ian Laperriere
pass and fired a shot on goal that deflected off Cammalleri's left
skate into the Coyote net, giving the Kings a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, however, made sure the Coyotes received their own share
of gifts. Phoenix picked up its first soft goal off an odd bounce
from a shot by right wing Mike Johnson at 6:39. With the puck just
beyond the goal line deep in the right corner, Johnson fired it
toward the King net, only to have it bounce off goaltender Felix
Potvin's left skate to tie the game, 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Smolinski gave the Kings a 2-1 lead on a highlight play that would
make the Galaxy proud. After receiving a pass from defenseman Lubomir
Visnovski, Smolinski played a little soccer with the puck by knocking
it down with his stick and then kicking it back to his stick before
scoring at 6:39 for his seventh goal.</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes didn't have to work as hard as Smolinski to tie the
score at 2-2, benefiting again from a King miscue. This time it was
the Kings' failure to get the puck out of their own zone that led to
Phoenix's second score, which came on a goal from Daniel Briere, who
slid the puck between Potvin's legs at 13:19.</TE>
<TE>   In a wild second period, which featured a major fight between King
defenseman Brad Norton and former King Kelly Buchberger along with 38
combined penalty minutes, the Kings took their third lead of the game
on a power-play goal from defenseman Mathieu Schneider.</TE>
<TE>   But Phoenix right wing Branko Radivojevic tied the score at 3-3
and forced overtime when he launched a shot from the left circle that
seemed to catch Potvin off guard. The King goaltender allowed the
puck to sneak under his legs at 13:59.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd total was also the largest hockey crowd ever at Staples
Center, surpassing a mark of 18,700 established in the first round of
last season's playoffs against Colorado in Game 6 on April 27.</TE>

<HD>Top Supercross Rider McGrath Retires</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shav Glick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeremy McGrath, the rider who did more than anyone else to make the
stadium sport of supercross the fastest growing in motor racing, has
decided to retire at age 31.</LD>
<LD>   The seven-time American Motorcyclist Assn. supercross champion and
the winner of a record 72 main events, rode in two races in Europe
this month, but decided after returning home to call it a career. His
decision was reported by former national champion Rick Johnson on
www.supercross.com.</LD>
<LD>   "I've always told myself that when I have other things on my mind
besides giving 100% and winning, I would retire," McGrath was quoted
by Johnson.</LD>
<TE>   Two recent injuries, one a dislocated hip and the other a
concussion, contributed to his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since [the injuries,] I've been tentative on the bike and
not giving it 100%," McGrath said. "I'm not going to go out and ride
around mid-pack when people and companies have hired me to be near
the front of the pack, and winning."</TE>
<TE>   McGrath, who had switched manufacturers from Yamaha to KTM after
the 2002 season, finished seventh in the Netherlands and sixth in
Switzerland in world championship supercross events won by veteran
David Vuillemin of France and rookie Chad Reed, who is moving up to
the 250cc class after winning the 125cc eastern regional title last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The 2003 AMS supercross season will open Jan. 4 at Edison Field in
Anaheim with Ricky Carmichael, of Havana, Fla., defending his
championship. Between 1991, when McGrath came out of Murrieta to win
the first of two western 125cc titles, and 2001, when he was
dethroned by Carmichael, McGrath was the most exciting and successful
rider in the sport's history. During that period, supercross moved
from an off-breed relative of outdoor motocross into a stadium sport
that attracted capacity crowds at many of the country's leading
sports venues.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath, who began his racing career riding bicycle-motocross as a
teenager, won his first 250cc supercross championship as a rookie in
1993 and won six of the next seven years. In 1997, after switching to
a new bike, he finished second, then also was second in 2001 to
Carmichael. Last year he was third.</TE>
<TE>   He also won consecutive world championships in 1994 and 1995.</TE>

<HD>A Title Might Mean Retirement for Favre</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brett Favre hinted Thursday he might be ready for retirement if the
Green Bay Packers win the Super Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   The only three-time NFL most valuable player has been asked
several times this season about retirement, and the quarterback had
to respond to the questions again Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "I have every intention of coming back next year," Favre said, but
he also took the issue a step further. "I know the question has been
raised, 'What if you won the Super Bowl?' " Favre said. "Well, my
response has been and will always be, 'I hope I have that decision to
make.'</LD>
<TE>   "If we win the Super Bowl, it's not a guarantee that I would
retire," he said. "But, think about it from my standpoint -- wouldn't
you want to go out on top? Sure. Who wouldn't?</TE>
<TE>   "Now, a lot has to happen between now and then, but I have every
intention of coming back next year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First-year Washington Redskin Coach Steve Spurrier said he has
promoted running backs coach Hue Jackson, a former USC assistant, to
offensive coordinator, effective in January.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like every team in this league has an offensive
coordinator even though the head coach calls plays," Spurrier said.
"Looking back, I feel this is a good way for us to go."</TE>
<TE>   However, Spurrier said he will still continue to be the primary
play-caller and also continue to develop the Redskins' passing game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay quarterback Brad Johnson said his sore back is
improving, but it's unlikely he'll play Sunday night when the
Buccaneers play against the Chicago Bears.</TE>
<TE>   If he is unable to play against the Bears, Rob Johnson will make
his second start of the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Eagle quarterback Donovan McNabb is running and
throwing again, but his status for the playoffs remains uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb has been out since breaking his right ankle Nov. 17.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no guarantee that he'll be ready at all and we understand
that," Eagle Coach Andy Reid said. "He's pushing himself and he's
determined that he'll be ready to go, so we'll just see how it all
works out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jacksonville Jaguar quarterback Mark Brunell missed his second day
in a row of practice because of a hamstring strain and his status for
Sunday's game against Indianapolis will be decided at game time. If
Brunell can't play, rookie David Garrard will make his first career
start.... Oakland cornerback Tory James, who hasn't played since Dec.
12 after surgery for a cracked right fibula, will be back in the
starting lineup Saturday against the Kansas City Chiefs.... Denver
Bronco quarterback Brian Griese had little trouble with his sprained
left knee in practice, clearing the way for him to back up Steve
Beuerlein against Arizona.</TE>

<HD>Thrashers Dismiss Fraser as Their Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Curt Fraser was fired Thursday as coach of the Atlanta Thrashers, who
have the worst record in the NHL. He has been the only coach in the
team's 3 1/2-year history.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Don Waddell will be the interim head coach when
the Thrashers play at Carolina today. Waddell's only previous
coaching experience was in the minor leagues a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we all have to be held accountable," Waddell said at a
news conference. "I'll tell the players today when we meet that they
got a good guy, a good person, fired."</LD>
<TE>   Fraser is the fourth NHL coach to be dismissed since the start of
the season, following Darryl Sutter (San Jose), Greg Gilbert
(Calgary) and Bob Hartley (Colorado).</TE>
<TE>   Waddell said he made his decision Tuesday, a day after Atlanta
lost, 5-1, to Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "Talking with Curt ... he was devastated after that loss," Waddell
said. "This is probably the toughest business decision I've ever
made."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 3, Dallas 1 -- The Predators scored two goals in 30
seconds in the third period at Nashville to hold off the Stars, who
had Mike Modano back in the lineup after he sat out three games
because of a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 6, New York Rangers 1 -- Mario Lemieux, the NHL's
scoring leader, had a goal and two assists night to lead the Penguins
over the Rangers at New York. In two victories this season, the
Penguins have outscored the Rangers, 12-1.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Columbus 2 -- Tomas Holmstrom had his first two-goal
game since March 2001 to lead the Red Wings over the Blue Jackets at
Detroit. The defending Stanley Cup champions have lost only once in
the last 12 games (8-1-3).</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 4, Edmonton 2 -- Brendan Morrison and Todd Bertuzzi had
a goal and an assist each at Edmonton, Canada, as the Canucks beat
the Oilers for the third time in less than two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Colorado 2 -- Pavol Demitra had two goals and an
assist at St. Louis and Scott Mellanby scored the go-ahead goal when
the puck popped up in the air and dropped over Patrick Roy's
outstretched glove.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 2, Chicago 2 -- Theo Fleury stuffed in a rebound of Alex
Zhamnov's shot from the slot after Dwayne Roloson made a pad save at
3:06 of the third period to give the Blackhawks a tie with the Wild
at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 3, Buffalo 2 -- Daniel Alfredsson scored the tiebreaking
goal in the second period and had two assists to lift the Senators at
Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>

<HD>A Traveling Call on Harris</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oklahoma Sooners were missing an important face when they resumed
Rose Bowl preparations with a Thursday practice at Loyola Marymount
University.</LD>
<LD>   It was the team's first full day in Southern California and
All-American defensive tackle Tommie Harris was a no-show because of
confusion over his travel arrangements.</LD>
<LD>   The massive sophomore showed up for a Christmas Day flight to Los
Angeles thinking he had a confirmed reservation. Airline employees
thought different and sent him home.</LD>
<TE>   Harris was expected to join the team in time for this morning's
session, so Coach Bob Stoops did not seem overly concerned about the
slip-up.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all been there," he said. "It has happened to me three or
four times."</TE>
<TE>   Practice was otherwise uneventful, a few fans in the bleachers and
local high school coaches watching from the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Antwone Savage got his feet tangled with a defensive back
and limped for a while, but continued to work out. The team was happy
to be in the sunshine and ocean breezes after leaving 40-degree
temperatures, snow and ice in Norman, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   Stoops said his players had performed as expected after a few days
off. He had them run 40 or so live plays, explaining that
"scrimmaging always makes them play harder."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tournament of Roses executives said the Sooner Schooner, the
covered wagon that rumbles across the field before Oklahoma games,
would be allowed on the Rose Bowl turf. There had been some concern
that its wheels might damage the playing surface.</TE>
<TE>   With that situation resolved, an Oklahoma official wondered if
Boomer and Sooner, the matching white ponies that pull the wagon,
would be ready for the 5.5-mile Rose Parade earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   "The ponies have never walked that far," a spokesman said.
"They're not very big."</TE>
<TE>   The schooner -- modeled after the Conestoga wagons that carried
pioneers to Oklahoma -- will be adorned with flowers to satisfy
parade regulations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tustin High alumnus Chris Chester is one of only a few
Californians on the Oklahoma roster.</TE>
<TE>   Although the freshman tight end played sparingly this season, he
caught a crucial touchdown pass on a fake field goal at Missouri. And
when the team accepted a bid to come west, his teammates went to him
for advice about Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "They only knew the stereotypes that you see in the movies,"
Chester said. "They asked me to show them all the hot spots."</TE>
<TE>   Chester wasn't quite as much help as they might have thought.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm from Tustin," he said. "That's a little out of the way."</TE>

<LD>Bode Miller is doing his part to challenge Austria's World Cup alpine
skiing dominance.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, who won silver in the giant slalom and combined events at
the Salt Lake City Olympics, recorded his first World Cup victory of
the season Sunday on the strength of a bold first run of a giant
slalom at Alta Badia, Italy. His 1.06-second triumph over Davide
Simoncelli of Italy vaulted Miller into second place in the overall
World Cup standings, behind Stephan Eberharter of Austria.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a wait, but it was a great hill to do it," Miller said on
the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Assn. Web site. "This was the one I wanted
all year."</LD>
<TE>   After 13 World Cup races Miller has 433 points and Eberharter, who
injured his right knee two weeks ago at Val d'Isere, France, has 548
points. Eberharter was expected to be out for several weeks but was
cleared two days ago to compete in a downhill Sunday at Bormio,
Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter took home gold (giant slalom), silver (super-giant
slalom) and bronze (downhill) from Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Miller also is second in the giant slalom standings with 225
points, behind Michael Von Gruenigen of Switzerland, and 13th in the
downhill after four races. The native of Franconia, N.H., is
competing this season in all four events (downhill, slalom, giant
slalom and super-G) and is only now starting to feel comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I've begun developing into a four-event skier," he said.
"But to me, a four-event skier is someone who can compete to win in
all four events. I'm competing and I'm scoring good points, so I'm
getting there.... "I have my hands full being prepared for each race.
I'm really excited about how I'm skiing, though, and the feelings I'm
getting from my skis."</TE>
<TE>   The women's World Cup circuit resumes Saturday and Sunday with
giant slalom and slalom races at Semmering, Austria. Janica Kostelic
of Croatia, who won gold at Salt Lake City in the giant slalom,
slalom and combined plus silver in the super-G, is the overall
women's leader with 775 points. Last year's World Cup overall leader,
Michaela Dorfmeister of Austria, has 438. Three U.S. skiers are in
the top 20, with Kirsten Clark sixth, Caroline Lalive 17th and Sarah
Schleper 19th.</TE>
<TE>   Tracking Marion</TE>
<TE>   Nic Bideau, who coaches several Australian distance runners, said
the country's track and field federation should rescind its
invitation to Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery to run in a Grand Prix
meet in Melbourne in March because they were seen working with banned
coach Charlie Francis.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't be the first people I'd be bringing to Australia
anymore because this is what everyone is going to talk about. It will
be the focus of their trip," Bideau told The Australian, a national
newspaper. "Unless this is cleared up I would think it is not ideal
to have them here."</TE>
<TE>   Jones said earlier this month she had left coach Trevor Graham to
train under Canadian Derek Hansen. She and Montgomery were
photographed in Toronto working on the track with Hansen and with
Francis, who was prohibited from coaching Canadian athletes after
admitting he provided steroids to sprinter Ben Johnson. Johnson was
stripped of the 100-meter gold medal at Seoul in 1988 after testing
positive for banned substances.</TE>
<TE>   Bideau said he respects Francis' coaching ability, but added,
"ideally, you'd think Jones and Montgomery would prefer to find
someone else because of the baggage he carries."</TE>
<TE>   The head of Athletics Australia, Simon Allatson, told The
Australian he has no qualms about Jones and Montgomery training or
competing in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence that I'm aware of that would suggest Marion
and Tim are doing anything untoward," he said. "The fact that Francis
had a relationship with Ben Johnson and he was sanctioned by his
national federation, that is in the past.... "</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Lamine Diack, president of the International Assn. of Athletics
Federations (the governing body of track and field), plans to run for
office again. He is expected to announce at the IAAF Congress this
summer in Paris that he will run for another four-year term. Diack
succeeded Primo Nebiolo, who died in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   USA Track and Field's indoor Golden Spike Tour will consist of
four events, starting Feb. 1 with the Boston Indoor Games at the
Reggie Lewis Center in Boston. It will continue Feb. 7 with the
Millrose Games at New York's Madison Square Garden and Feb. 15 with
the Tyson Invitational at Fayetteville, Ark. The tour wraps up at the
Reggie Lewis Center March 1-2 with the U.S. indoor championships. The
top two finishers in the U.S. championships will qualify for the
world indoor championships, March 14-16 at Birmingham, England.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Garcia of Carson, 17, won her third consecutive U.S. junior
short track speedskating title last weekend in Cleveland Heights,
Ohio. She qualified for the junior world championships next month in
Budapest, Hungary, as did Lezleigh Jaworski of Long Beach and Alice
Kim of Reseda. Derek Gray of Muskegon, Mich., won the junior men's
title.... The U.S. senior long track speed skating championships
begin today at the Olympic Oval in Kerns, Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic bobsled silver medalists Todd Hays and Randy Jones won two
World Cup medals before the tour began a holiday break. They teamed
to win the two-man competition at La Plagne, France, for Hays' first
World Cup victory in a year, and finished second in the four-man
competition with Steve Mesler and Ivan Radcliff.... The U.S. women's
hockey team opened training camp Thursday at Lake Placid, N.Y. The
camp, which will include intra-squad scrimmages, is part of the
selection process for the team that will compete at the world
championships, April 3-9 in Beijing, China.</TE>
<TE>   Rena Inoue and John Baldwin of Santa Monica, expected to contend
for the pairs title at next month's U.S. figure skating
championships, are among 10 local skaters scheduled to perform in an
exhibition Thursday at 1 p.m. at the Ice Palace in Aliso Viejo.
Skaters will perform the programs they will skate at the U.S.
championships. Admission is free, but donations are welcome to help
pay skaters' training expenses.</TE>

<KH>Q &amp; A WITH MARCUS ALLEN</KH>
<HD>He's Proud of Palmer, Still Puzzled by Davis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 21 years, he had the distinction of being the last Trojan to win
the Heisman Trophy, until quarterback Carson Palmer was given the
award this season.</LD>
<LD>   He is expected to have the distinction of being in the next class
of inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame when the names are
revealed Super Bowl weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Marcus Allen, now a CBS broadcaster, is thrilled at Palmer's
honor, apprehensive about discussing his own chances next month and
still perplexed, all these years later, about his feud with Raider
owner Al Davis, which ultimately drove Allen out of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Question: Have you had a chance to talk to Palmer?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: I talked to him before the Heisman show on a cell phone. I
told him that I had admired the year he had had, how he handled
himself, how he had played. I talked to him about the East Coast bias
and I told him, whatever happens, he's a winner in my book.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How much bias do you feel there is with East Coast voters?</TE>
<TE>   A: There are some people who don't know they play football west of
the Mississippi. It seems like the East Coast players get a little
more attention. We hadn't had a Heisman Trophy winner on the West
Coast in 21 years. It sure seems like someone must have been
deserving.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How did you react when Palmer's name was announced?</TE>
<TE>   A: I was watching in Cleveland, where I was on an assignment. I
was a little nervous and, when they said Carson Palmer was the
winner, I started jumping up and down, like my own brother had won.
In a sense, as a fellow Trojan, he is my brother.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What was it like when you won?</TE>
<TE>   A: It was different. It was so clandestine. As soon as I got
there, they rushed me up the stairs, taking me the back way into a
room where I was told that I was the winner. John Jackson, my running
backs coach, was with me. He hugged me and started crying.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have you felt like crying, watching your Trojans struggle in
recent seasons?</TE>
<TE>   A: We had one of the more storied programs in all of sports. When
I went there, there wasn't a question in anybody's mind that was the
school to go to. There was a time when we would have three players
going in the first round of the NFL draft. That hasn't happened in a
long time. In recent years, we lost that luster, but now, with
[Coach] Pete Carroll and Carson winning the Heisman and the young
players we have, we've certainly got that luster back. This is not
just an ordinary university. You have a lot to live up to as a
player.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Much of the blame for USC's failures on the football field fell
on Athletic Director Mike Garrett. How do you think he handled the
situation?</TE>
<TE>   A: As a former player, you are more competitive than any nonplayer
would be, a lot more critical, a lot more frustrated. Mike has such
high standards for the players, both academically and athletically.
When I talk to Mike, he has always been very firm, very resolute
about the direction of the program, even when things weren't going
well. Has he suffered moments of uncertainty? I never saw any of
that. I know the kind of person he is. The hallmark of a great leader
is, does he change his mind every time he is criticized? In Mike's
case, absolutely not. When he hired Pete, a lot of people said, "What
are you doing?" The sign of a great leader is someone who does what
he thinks is right. Mike felt in his heart he was doing the right
thing for the kids, for the program, for USC.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Speaking of doing what you feel is right in your heart, if you
should make it to the Hall of Fame, which team -- the Raiders or the
Kansas City Chiefs -- would you want to be identified with?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't even like to talk about it, but if it happened, I would
like to go in representing both teams. I would want to pay homage to
both teams.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Does that mean you and Al Davis have finally settled your
differences?</TE>
<TE>   A: I made several attempts to do so, but it seemed as if there was
no energy to resolve things on the other side. So I finally gave up.
Now, I really don't care. That was another life.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What was the cause of the feud?</TE>
<TE>   A: To this day, it's still very mystifying to me. I couldn't
understand it. I wish the whole thing could have been avoided, but
it's hard to avoid something when you don't see any logical reason
why it is happening. There are a lot of theories. Some people say he
didn't want to draft me in the first place. Others say it's because
no one gets bigger than the organization and the organization is him.
Some people may have referred to the team as Marcus Allen and the
Raiders, but that was not by my doing. All I ever wanted to do was
play. If you say I wanted the ball, it was because I thought that was
our best chance of winning, not because I wanted to accomplish
anything individually. I was never a stat guy. How many receptions?
How many yards? I was never like that. I don't think anybody was more
dedicated to winning than I was. Lucid people could see what was
going on. It still baffles me. If you want to win, you have to have
your best players out there. They should have never had me coming
into camp No. 4 on the depth chart. Come on.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So looking back, there's nothing you could have done different?</TE>
<TE>   A: The only thing I wish was different was that there was free
agency at the time. Then I wouldn't have had to go through all that.
It was all such a waste. What I don't understand is, if you don't
want me, if I'm this cancer, this negative thing, then let me go, cut
me, release me. That's what I kept asking for. If I was so negative
for the team, how come the players voted me the winner of the
Commitment to Excellence award one season when I barely played? Then
[management] comes back and says they have to vote again because they
claimed it was so close, and I wound up sharing the award.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How about your relationship with former head coach Art Shell,
which also suffered in those days?</TE>
<TE>   A: I tried to talk to Art when he came to Kansas City [as an
assistant coach] because I didn't want any negative carry-over, but
he pretended like nothing had happened. So I just dropped it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What did you think when the Raiders followed you out of town?</TE>
<TE>   A: I believe they could have been such a powerful force in Los
Angeles. Right up there with the Lakers and the Dodgers. What
happened? It's all so bewildering.</TE>

<LD>Yes, there are way too many bowl games. No, they're not going away
any time soon, at least not until the Seattle and Silicon Valley
bowls exhaust their lines of credit.</LD>
<LD>   A viewer's guide to who's playing, what it means, when they kick
off, where you can see it and why you should or shouldn't tune in:</LD>
<LD>   Houston Bowl</LD>
<TE>   Who: Southern Mississippi (7-5) vs. Oklahoma State (7-5). What:
Brett Favre's alma mater against a team that couldn't beat UCLA. Lot
of good that did Bob Toledo. When: Today, 10 a.m. Where: ESPN. Why:
Gallery Furniture asked the same question. Unable to come up with a
reasonable answer, it dropped its sponsorship.</TE>
<TE>   Independence Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Nebraska (7-6) vs. Mississippi (6-6). What: Nebraska receives
its penance for its worst season in four decades -- a lovely holiday
season spent in Shreveport. Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning
continues to pay for his decision not to follow brother Peyton to
Tennessee. When: Today, 1:30 p.m. Where: ESPN. Why: Nebraska puts its
major-college record streak of 40 consecutive winning seasons on the
line.</TE>
<TE>   Holiday Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Kansas State (10-2) vs. Arizona State (8-5). What: Kansas
State is 10-2, same as USC, and defeated USC, yet the Trojans are
playing Iowa on Thursday and the Wildcats got sent here. Somebody is
going to pay, and pay dearly, and its name is Arizona State. When:
Today, 5 p.m. Where: ESPN. Why: At what point will Kansas State Coach
Bill Snyder's bitterness cease? Kansas State's 35th? Forty-fifth?
Sixty-fourth?</TE>
<TE>   Continental Tire Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: West Virginia (9-3) vs. Virginia (8-5). What: Two conference
runners-up dragged kicking and screaming from the Gator Bowl after
Notre Dame got bumped out of the bowl championship series picture.
When: Saturday, 8 a.m. Where: ESPN2. Why: Al Groh never had a chance
to coach a team in the Michelin, Goodyear or Firestone Bowls.</TE>
<TE>   Alamo Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Colorado (9-4) vs. Wisconsin (7-6). What: Colorado running
back Chris Brown was a Heisman Trophy candidate before getting hurt
in November. Wisconsin was 5-0 before required to play its Big Ten
schedule. When: Saturday, 5 p.m. Where: ESPN. Why: A great matchup
back in October.</TE>
<TE>   Music City Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Minnesota (7-5) vs. Arkansas (9-4). What: Minnesota went 0-4
to close its regular-season schedule. Arkansas lost to Georgia, 30-3,
in the Southeastern Conference title game. OK, so they might have
peaked a little early. When: Monday, 11 a.m. Where: ESPN. Why:
There's a chance Minnesota and Arkansas will never meet in a bowl
game again.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Wake Forest (6-6) vs. Oregon (7-5). What: Receiving a
last-minute reprieve from the Silicon Valley Bowl, Oregon stays
closer to home, sending thousands of unruly Duck fans across state
border into enemy (read: the hated Washington Huskies) territory. If
Seattle survives, its bowl game might not. When: Monday, 2:30 p.m.
Where: ESPN. Why: In 1948, Oregon and Cal tied for the Pacific Coast
Conference championship. When the member schools held a vote to
determine which school would represent the conference in the Rose
Bowl, Washington voted for Cal and encouraged Montana to do the same,
keeping Oregon at home and kicking off perhaps the fiercest football
rivalry on the West Coast. Fifty-four years later Oregon finally
readies for its revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Humanitarian Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Iowa State (7-6) vs. Boise State (11-1). What: Iowa State
quarterback Seneca Wallace set out scrambling for the Heisman, got
sidetracked a bit, wound up in Boise. When: Tuesday, 9 a.m. Where:
ESPN. Why: Iowa State was the only team in America to beat Iowa this
season. That and a .500 record in your other games will get you an
invitation to a bowl game played on a blue field.</TE>
<TE>   Sun Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Washington (7-5) vs. Purdue (6-6). What: 2001 Rose Bowl
redux, reduced. When: Tuesday, 11 a.m. Where: Channel 2. Why: Marques
Tuiasosopo and Drew Brees are gone, but lots of people say the "Harry
Potter" and "Lord of the Rings" sequels are better than the first
installments.</TE>
<TE>   Silicon Valley Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Georgia Tech (7-5) vs. Fresno State (8-5). What: Football as
metaphor for the sudden rise and fall of the dotcom industry. When:
Tuesday, 12:30 p.m. Where: ESPN2. Why: Tell your grandchildren you
witnessed the last Silicon Valley Bowl before the financing dried up.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Texas Christian (9-2) vs. Colorado State (10-3). What: The
Horned Frogs against one more team that lost to Bob Toledo. When:
Tuesday, 12:30 p.m. Where: ESPN. Why: Colorado State, which never met
an ESPN payday it could refuse, played three games on Thursday and
one on Friday this season, but never one on a Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Peach Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Maryland (10-3) vs. Tennessee (8-4). What: Maryland, which
could have kept four-loss Florida State out of a BCS bowl but didn't,
and Tennessee, which could have been a contender but wasn't, ring out
a year of regrets in luckless Atlanta. When: Tuesday, 4:30 p.m.
Where: ESPN. Why: New Year's Eve drinking game: Can you keep up with
Maryland and Tennessee fans, who will be getting a very early start?</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Air Force (8-4) vs. Virginia Tech (9-4). What: Air Force
opened 6-0, Virginia Tech 8-0 and all they got was this lousy loaf of
sourdough. When: Tuesday, 7:30 p.m. Where: ESPN2. Why: Home of the
Giants and the 49ers, San Francisco well-versed in dealing with teams
that don't know how to protect an early lead.</TE>
<TE>   Outback Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Michigan (9-3) vs. Florida (8-4). What: What if Drew Henson
stayed to play quarterback at Michigan? What if Steve Spurrier stayed
to keep coaching at Florida? Very likely, this would be the Fiesta
Bowl. When: Wednesday, 8 a.m. Where: ESPN. Why: Despite the fire Ron
Zook Web sites, Zook had a better season than Spurrier.</TE>
<TE>   Cotton Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Louisiana State (8-4) vs. Texas (10-2). What: Chris Simms
returns to the scene of his worst nightmares, the long-lost Red River
Shootouts against Oklahoma. Louisiana State, or what's left of it,
gets a trip to Dallas. When: Wednesday, 8 a.m. Where: Channel 11.
Why: Last chance to see Simms lose a big game before he moves on to
the pros.</TE>
<TE>   Gator Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Notre Dame (10-2) vs. North Carolina State (10-3). What: Bowl
politics at their finest. Subtitled: "Notre Dame Is Notre Dame. And
West Virginia Is Not." When: Wednesday, 9:30 a.m. Where: Channel 4.
Why: The last time Notre Dame appeared on national television, it
hand-delivered Carson Palmer the Heisman.</TE>
<TE>   Capital One Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Penn State (9-3) vs. Auburn (8-4). What: The game that used
to be the Florida Citrus Bowl that used to be the Tangerine Bowl,
back in the days before Joe Paterno went crazy about college football
referees. When: Wednesday, 10 a.m. Where: Channel 7. Why: Penn State
running back Larry Johnson runs angry, we have been told. See how he
runs after parlaying 2,000 yards and an 8.0 average into a distant
third place in the Heisman balloting.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Washington State (10-2) vs. Oklahoma (11-2). What: The
Granddaddy of Them All Before USC and Iowa Were Stolen Away by the
Orange Bowl, Mike Price Jumped to Alabama and Oklahoma Lost to
Oklahoma State. When: Wednesday, 2 p.m. Where: Channel 7. Why: So the
real Rose Bowl is being played 24 hours later in Florida. Try to look
on the positive side: This is a really, really good Holiday Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Sugar Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Georgia (12-1) vs. Florida State (9-4). What: Florida State
to play with its third-string quarterback because one quarterback
missed his final exam and another is being investigated for possibly
being involved in on-campus gambling. "Court TV" with hash marks.
When: Wednesday, 5:30 p.m. Where: Channel 7. Why: Not often you get
the chance to see Bobby Bowden lose five games in a season.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: USC (10-2) vs. Iowa (11-1). What: Football game sponsored by
FedEx, which overnighted the Rose Bowl to Miami. When: Thursday, 5
p.m. Where: Channel 7. Why: Best bowl on the board. Heisman winner
Palmer versus Heisman runner-up Brad Banks. The two hottest teams in
the nation. This matchup belonged either in the Rose Bowl or the
Fiesta Bowl, but greed, self-interest and politics forged the longest
right turn in college football history.</TE>
<TE>   Fiesta Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Who: Miami (12-0) vs. Ohio State (13-0). What: What the BCS always
wanted: A battle of the last two unbeaten teams. What the BCS got: A
two-touchdown point spread. When: Jan. 3, 5 p.m. Where: Channel 7.
Why: Miami is on a 34-game winning streak and its two star players,
quarterback Ken Dorsey and running back Willis McGahee, placed 4-5 in
the Heisman voting. Ohio State is 13-0 and a 13 1/2-point underdog.
Stay tuned, because either way, someone in the winning locker room is
going to say, "Nobody believed in us but us."</TE>

<DL>HOLLYWOOD, Fla.</DL>
<LD>USC cornerback Darrell Rideaux glanced at the hotel ballroom and the
private reception for the Trojans upon their arrival here Thursday
night and called it a revelation.</LD>
<LD>   "Now I see what the BCS is all about," Rideaux said.</LD>
<LD>   That was the prevailing sentiment of the Trojans' traveling party
as players, coaches, staff and administrators attended their first
event leading up to the Jan. 2 Orange Bowl game against Iowa.</LD>
<TE>   Players and coaches said the chartered flight from Los Angeles
touched down in Fort Lauderdale with a less than smooth landing, but
that was the only glitch of their travel day.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all great," kicker Ryan Killeen said, "but we know the
reason we came down here is to win the game."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll took steps to make sure his players felt
rewarded for their 10-2 regular season. Seniors have their own hotel
rooms. Curfew on Thursday was 2 a.m., the latest it will be all week.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel like a VIP," senior running back Justin Fargas said.
"When you think about a major bowl and everything that goes with it.
This is what it's about."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans practice for an hour this afternoon before resuming a
more typical practice routine on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll, who along with quarterback Carson Palmer and safety Troy
Polamalu will visit patients at a hospital this morning, said he was
pleased with the beginning of the bowl week.</TE>
<TE>   "It really has a first-class feel to the start of it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive coordinator Norm Chow, who turned down an offer to
become coach at Kentucky on Tuesday, said he was happy to turn his
full attention to preparing for Iowa. "It's nice to just think about
winning a football game," Chow said.... Carroll said the Trojans lost
no players for the bowl game because of grade problems.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pro football will soon make Washington State junior Rien Long a
wealthy young man.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, Long would already be filthy rich if he had a nickel
for every bonehead play he made as a junior varsity player only five
years ago at Anacortes (Wash.) High.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd never played football before," said Long, a pained grin
creasing his face. "It was my junior year, and I was on the junior
varsity. I didn't know anything."</LD>
<TE>   Anacortes Coach Ken Beyer was even more to the point.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't any good," Beyer said. Uh, that's all changed, Coach.</TE>
<TE>   Long was good enough by the end of that first season at Anacortes
to play a little on the varsity. He was good enough the next fall to
make all-state and earn a scholarship to Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   This season, Long has been good enough to reel in opposing
quarterbacks and All-American honors with equal aplomb, and he won
the Outland Trophy as the top interior lineman in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "He's as good as we've ever had here [at defensive tackle]," said
Bill Doba, the longtime Cougar defensive coordinator and newly
appointed head coach.</TE>
<TE>   "That's some compliment to Rien, because we've had a lot of great
players here," said Robb Akey, who has been promoted from defensive
line coach to defensive coordinator in the wake of coach Mike Price's
impending departure for Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Beyer never predicted football greatness for Long when the tall,
lanky kid was tripping over his feet on jayvee fields. However, Dick
Andrew, Anacortes' defensive coordinator at the time, knew Long was
something special after only a few preseason workouts.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me, 'Ted, that's going to be your first Division I
football player,' " Beyer recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Really.'</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Yes. Just look at him run.'</TE>
<TE>   "Dick knew; he'd coached 30 years."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Long's speed and quickness remain uncommon for a man of his
size. Listed at 6 feet 6 and 286 pounds, Long said he's actually 6-6
3/4 and pushing 290, even though he's rather lanky for a defensive
tackle and can still add strength, weight and bulk in the weight
room.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm skinny," Long said. "I'll look at game film and
I'll be thinking, 'Who's that skinny guy? Oh, that's me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Long relies on finesse more than muscle to put on a ferocious pass
rush. He tied for sixth in the NCAA Division I-A regular season with
13 sacks, many of them produced in critical situations and/or against
double-teams.</TE>
<TE>   Long strongly considered turning pro next season, but said he
decided to stay once Doba was named to replace Price after the Rose
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like Coach Doba and Akey and Mike Walker, my position
coaches," Long said.</TE>
<TE>   Long, whose mother had him drop the first letter from his legal
first name, Erien (AIR-e-un), because she didn't like the similarity
to Aryan Nations, always wanted to play youth football -- he lived in
Culver City before the family moved to Anacortes when he was in grade
school -- but he was bigger than league rules allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Now Long is bigger and better than ever, and the social sciences
major says he's also shown improvement in the classroom after a slow
start at Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   Long, who has little involvement with his father -- "My
stepfather, he's my dad." -- wants to set a good example for his
infant son, Gavon, who lives with a former girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Long found a second father, of sorts, in Beyer, and is grateful
for Beyer's work with him in football, track and field, and the
weight room.</TE>
<TE>   Beyer talked Long into turning out for track after his junior year
of basketball, and the result was two state medals in the shotput,
including a state championship as a senior.</TE>
<TE>   "He's amazing," Beyer said. "I don't think he's even close to
being topped out.... He's got a huge bone structure, and he's got 8%
body fat. That's what running backs and wide receivers have."</TE>
<TE>   Akey said, "He's very talented, and one of the great things he's
got is his toughness. He's a tough guy, and he's a competitor. At the
end of last season, he was playing with injuries that would keep a
lot of people out of a lot of games."</TE>
<TE>   Added Doba: "If he gets a little stronger next year, he'll be even
better. And he's got long arms. He'd make a hell of an offensive
lineman with those long arms."</TE>
<TE>   Don't look for Doba to be moving Long to offense anytime soon, or
for Long to volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good feeling to hit someone," Long said in his affable,
open manner. "As brutal as that sounds, I like to hit people."</TE>
<TE>   Long displayed his fondness for hitting people during a brawl at a
Washington State frat house a couple years back. Teammate Melvin
Simmons was seriously injured and now plays at USC after transferring
because his assailants were not prosecuted, but Long said he made
certain there had been some justice on Simmons' behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people got hurt in return," Long deadpanned. "I tried to
talk to them, but my verbal skills were just not up to par. Then I
started putting words on my knuckles. That seemed to help."</TE>
<TE>   Long's verbal skills did help him settle a dispute peacefully last
winter. According to Long, eight rather inebriated fellows decided to
pick a fight with him and a friend at a restaurant in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Recalled Long, "I grabbed two guys and put them up against the
wall and said, 'Do you want to dance?' It broke up after that."</TE>
<TE>   Long's ability to lay down the law figures to come in handy if he
pursues his goal of working as an agent for the FBI or the National
Security Agency after, hopefully, a long stay in the NFL. Those are
challenging careers, but Long seems up to the task.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm never scared about going against anybody," he said. "I'm
never scared about going against the best; I like playing against the
best. I play my best when I'm going against the best."</TE>
<TE>   Long is the ringleader of a Washington State defense that has
relied on quickness more than blitzing to rack up a school-record 52
sacks.</TE>
<TE>   Speedy ends Isaac Brown of Upland, Fred Shavies and D.D. Acholonu
are strong pass rushers.</TE>
<TE>   Run-stuffer Jeremey Williams helped Washington State rank seventh
in the nation in the regular season in rushing defense -- 82.3 yards
a game.</TE>
<TE>   Second-team All-American Marcus Trufant is a top NFL prospect.
Fellow cornerback Jason David of Covina led Division I-A with 0.78
interceptions a game -- seven in nine games -- even though he missed
three games after his jaw was broken when he was sucker-punched by
linebacker Ira Davis in a locker-room dispute over a woman.</TE>
<TE>   Fleet free safety Erik Coleman leads the Cougars with 76 tackles.
Outside linebacker Will Derting is a promising freshman who
intercepted three passes in the season opener. Middle linebacker
Mawuli Davis earned a scholarship and a starting job this fall as a
senior transfer from New Mexico State.</TE>
<TE>   Despite playing in the pass-happy Pacific 10 Conference, the
Cougars finished the regular season in the top 40 nationally in
points given up, 21.8, and total yards given up a game, 338.8. The
Cougar pass defense ranked 103rd among 117 teams at 256.5.</TE>

<KH>WASHINGTON STATE REPORT</KH>
<HD>Gesser Looks More Mobile</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens and Mike Terry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It appears that time off has helped Washington State quarterback
Jason Gesser recover from a sprained ankle. The senior looked
considerably more mobile during Thursday's practice at the Coliseum
than he had in the regular-season finale against UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   Gesser suffered the injury in the fourth quarter of the Cougars'
29-26 triple-overtime loss to Washington on Nov. 23. He played the
UCLA game essentially on one leg and threw for 247 yards and two
touchdowns in a 48-27 victory to clinch the Pacific 10 Conference
title and the Rose Bowl berth.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been doing a lot better than it did before," he said of the
right ankle. "I would say I'm at 75, 80%. Now I can actually plant my
foot and not hobble when I hand the ball off."</LD>
<TE>   Coach Mike Price said he was pleased with how Gesser looked in
practice. The quarterback continues to wear a brace.</TE>
<TE>   "He was scrambling around out there," Price said. "I didn't want
him to do that. I told him to slow it down a little bit. But he's
been getting better every day."</TE>
<TE>   Gesser said he was over the disappointment of not being invited to
New York for the Heisman Trophy award presentation. He said he
thought his candidacy ended in the Washington loss, even though he
wasn't around at the end.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser was selected co-offensive player of the year in the Pac-10
with USC quarterback Carson Palmer, who won the Heisman.</TE>
<TE>   "You know that you can't lose late in a season like that," he
said. "You can always look back at what could have happened. But we
got to where we wanted to be."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All-America defensive tackle Rien Long said he knew his stock has
risen in the last couple of weeks after winning the Outland Trophy as
college football's best interior lineman.</TE>
<TE>   But that won't sway his decision to return for his senior season
and not declare for the NFL draft. He is loving college football too
much.</TE>
<TE>   "You always have that idea in your mind but I'm coming back for
sure," Long said. "I came in here with my class and I'm leaving with
my class. Knowing that I have an extra year to play this game, I
wouldn't miss it for the world."</TE>
<TE>   Long, a 6-foot-6, 286-pound junior, would be a possible
first-round pick if he came out but said he would like to become the
second player to win the Outland twice. Dave Rimington was a two-time
winner for Nebraska in 1981 and '82.</TE>
<TE>   Long has recorded 13 sacks and 20.5 tackles for loss for the
Cougars this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars took their turn at one of the Rose Bowl's
long-standing traditions -- the 47th annual Lawry's Beef Bowl.
Oklahoma will dine on its prime rib feast on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State last came to Lawry's in 1998 where, according to
Price, they ate more beef than Michigan, but didn't win the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope there's no correlation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars did their best to put a dent in the restaurant's
reserves, eating a collective 585 pounds of meat according to
restaurant General Manager Todd Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   The top consumers, not surprisingly, were linemen -- seniors Phil
Locker, Derrick Roche, junior Josh Parrish and freshman Brent Evans
all had four servings of prime rib.</TE>

<HD>The Mayor Who Got Caught</HD>
<DH>Berkeley's Tom Bates, a liberal, apologized for dumping
campus papers endorsing his opponent, but he refuses to step down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Pogash</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>This town's new mayor, the impeccably credentialed progressive Tom
Bates, remains under siege. Next month, he is expected to plead
guilty to an infraction for stealing hundreds of copies of a student
newspaper endorsing his opponent and, officials said, he has offered
to speak in local classrooms about the importance of controlling his
impulses.</LD>
<LD>   Even his closest allies say what he did was unethical and just
plain stupid.</LD>
<LD>   Bates issued vague apologies that made it sound as though his
supporters had swiped the Daily Californian, the newspaper of the
students at UC Berkeley, when he alone was caught dumping them. He
also likened the trashing of the papers to being caught off-sides
when he played football for Cal, an analogy that critics said
trivialized the error.</LD>
<TE>   Bates may be suffering from the "Trent Lott factor," said Orville
Schell, the dean of UC Berkeley's Journalism School, "It's great to
say you're sorry, but it doesn't erase the stain."</TE>
<TE>   The story of what occurred on Nov. 4, the day before the mayoral
election, is not only an indictment of a lifelong liberal politician
with an until-now-unblemished record in Sacramento, but also an
indictment of the local press, which was informed of the story but
ignored it until it could no longer be ignored. Had the news been
printed on election day, it's not clear whether the outcome would
have changed.</TE>
<TE>   Bates compounded his difficulties when he told the city editor of
the Daily Cal that he had nothing to do with the journalistic
hijacking.</TE>
<TE>   In Boston or Chicago, such thievery might be considered standard
political shenanigans. But in Berkeley, home of 1960s political
dissent and the Free Speech Movement, Bates' tossing of the
newspapers is viewed as nothing short of a sin.</TE>
<TE>   Bates steadfastly rebuffs those, such as the editors of the Daily
Cal, who have demanded that he step down. And Berkeley law forbids a
recall for six months.</TE>
<TE>   At 64, Bates has had a long career in the Assembly built around
progressive causes such as the environment, human rights, housing,
civil rights, disability rights -- on all things important to the
left.</TE>
<TE>   His credentials on the 1st Amendment and free speech seemed
impeccable. He even sponsored a bill proclaiming Oct. 1 as Free
Speech Movement Day.</TE>
<TE>   Bates and his wife, newly elected Assemblywoman Loni Hancock
(D-Berkeley), are a politically powerful couple not to be trifled
with -- compared by some locals to Bill and Hillary Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   In the campaign for mayor, the 6-foot-tall Bates challenged
Berkeley Mayor Shirley Dean, a rotund, 4-foot-11 politician of strong
will. The fight grew ugly ahead of the election, with Bates insisting
he wouldn't go negative, but at the same time alleging that Dean was
both mean-spirited and divisive. Dean promoted her development of the
downtown arts district.</TE>
<TE>   Bates contended that his wife, who served two terms as Berkeley's
mayor, deserved the credit for the arts district. With his
connections to all things liberal, Bates racked up a tower of local
endorsements, including the Democratic Party, the Green Party, the
Sierra Club, NOW, the Central Labor Council, the Gay and Lesbian
Democratic Club and the San Francisco Chronicle. And although it
looked as if he'd win the race, the outcome was far from certain.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning before the vote, Bates was distributing campaign
literature at Sproul Plaza, birthplace of Berkeley's political
dissent. Wearing a blue and gold sweater, which the police report
said made him easy to spot, Bates approached the Berkeley College
Republicans' table, whose members were handing out their magazine,
the California Patriot. He repeatedly asked for copies of the
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   That chagrined economics major Kelly Coyne, a campus Republican
activist who was handing out the magazine. She found Bates charming
when he spoke at her sorority, but the Patriot had written more
favorably about Dean and found both candidates too liberal to
endorse.</TE>
<TE>   Coyne could not understand why Bates kept returning to the
Republican table to pick up copies of the magazine. She described his
behavior as downright "weird."</TE>
<TE>   Republican student Steve Sexton, a onetime Daily Cal reporter,
checked out a nearby garbage can to see if Bates had tossed the
Patriot copies. Sexton not only retrieved the Patriots, but also
found a stack of Daily Cals. Like a good reporter, Sexton immediately
telephoned the Daily Cal. While on the line with the city editor,
Sexton blurted out, "Oh, my God! He just did it again!" as he saw
Bates dump another load of newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Coyne grabbed her Kodak Fun Saver camera, missing the actual
dumping of the broadsheets, but photographing Bates afterward. She
later handed the camera over to campus police.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, Daily Cal city editor Mike Meyers approached Bates.
When asked, Bates denied he had dumped the newspapers. Their
conversation, according to the police report, ended with Bates
telling the journalist, "C'est la vie."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Coyne had to study for an exam, but she thought it more
important to alert voters about the mayoral candidate who tried to
stifle dissent.</TE>
<TE>   She called Dean's campaign office, which said it wanted nothing to
do with the story. A campaign staffer gave her a list of media
contacts, Coyne said. She and friends then spent the afternoon at her
sorority house calling radio, TV and newspaper outlets, none of which
did the story.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a huge story that fell into their laps at the
homestretch," Coyne said. But the media "thought it was petty. I
thought that's what made the story -- how petty [Bates] was."</TE>
<TE>   And then there was her affiliation. Editors told her that because
she was a Republican, she wasn't "a credible witness," a position
that still rankles her today.</TE>
<TE>   Sexton said he was told by a suspicious Daily Cal editor, "You
guys have a political ax to grind."</TE>
<TE>   The Daily Cal postponed publishing the story, said Rong-Gong Lin,
editor in chief and president, because "we didn't know absolutely for
a fact that, given the gravity of the charge, that it was true. We
wanted to be absolutely sure."</TE>
<TE>   Had Bates told the truth, said Lin, it would have been different.
"It would have been the lead story in every Bay Area paper on
election day."</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Nov. 5, should have been a career-capping moment for
Bates. He won the election by more than 5,000 votes; his progressive
allies won a majority on the Berkeley City Council; and his wife was
elected to the state Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   The story of his stealing the newspapers didn't seep out until a
month later, when the Daily Californian, with Bates' own statement
vaguely acknowledging wrongdoing, published the story.</TE>
<TE>   "He's as contrite as he can be," said his attorney, Robert
Cheasty. "It's been a very devastating experience for him."</TE>
<TE>   Bates will pay a fine of $250, pay the campus newspaper $500 and
talk to student groups about controlling one's impulses, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bates has had to weather the tempest largely alone; some of his
closest allies are saying nothing on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the story broke, Berkeley City Council member Kriss
Worthington called Bates' actions "immoral, illegal and idiotic." But
stepping down, said the Bates supporter, was going too far, likening
it to "capital punishment."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his many apologies, Bates has not apologized to the
Republican students or to Dean, his opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "Never once has he admitted that [what he did] could have had an
effect on the election," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take very many high-visibility errant acts like this
one to contaminate the whole barrel of politicians," said Schell, the
UC Berkeley Journalism School dean. "That's what makes this so
lamentable."</TE>
<TE>   Writer, critic and raconteur Christopher Hitchens, a visiting
fellow at the Journalism School next semester, called Bates' trashing
of the newspapers "a metaphorical moment .... There's no intolerance
like liberal intolerance."</TE>
<TE>   Protesters objected recently when Hitchens spoke on campus. But
the author said he hoped that Bates' action would confirm liberals'
hypocrisy. "This is a good, flagrant, indefensible example," Hitchens
said. He said Bates' attitude was: "We just have to win. We can be
appropriately ruthless."</TE>
<TE>   Then Hitchens inquired: "On behalf of what exactly?"</TE>
<TE>   Bates has suffered from an arrogance of power that goes beyond the
theft of the newspapers, said Councilwoman Betty Olds. The new mayor,
for example, has attempted to shorten council meetings by selecting
agenda items along with two council members he has designated.
Opponents say that goes too far -- censoring other council members.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just as cocky as ever," Olds said. "He's got to be careful.
I don't know that he is."</TE>

<LD>William G. Bennett, a furniture store chain owner and failed investor
who found new ways to market the glittery glamour of Las Vegas to the
Middle American masses, has died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Bennett, a multimillionaire philanthropist who refashioned the Las
Vegas Strip for the non-wealthy and their families, died Sunday in
that city's Desert Springs Hospital following a lengthy illness. He
had suffered a heart attack in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   As chairman of Circus Circus Enterprises from 1974 to 1994,
Bennett turned around the failing flagship Circus Circus resort, and
extended the Strip southward by building the themed mega-resorts
Excalibur in 1990 and Luxor in 1993.</LD>
<TE>   In 1995, he worked to strengthen the northern end of the Strip by
buying and renovating the 50-year-old Sahara.</TE>
<TE>   Over several decades, Bennett pioneered trends to lure quantity
over quality spenders, concentrating on drawing millions of the
slot-machine crowd from the heartland, rather than the thousands of
high-rollers already flying in to the pricey resorts.</TE>
<TE>   And he added rides and entertainment, such as the Sahara's
virtual-reality motor sports Speedworld, to persuade the gamblers to
bring along their children.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Glendale, Ariz., the son of a rancher, Bennett served as a
Navy dive-bomber pilot during World War II. After the war, he built a
Phoenix-based furniture store chain, which he sold in 1962 to go into
a friend's investment business. But because of mismanagement by other
officials and the resulting scandal, Bennett was bankrupted.</TE>
<TE>   By 1965, he was working as an employee of Del Webb Corp.
developers, which hoped to bring businessmen into its casino
operation. Bennett began at the company's Sahara Tahoe, learning the
resort business as casino host at night and in various hotel
departments by day.</TE>
<TE>   Within a year, he was transferred to downtown Las Vegas to manage
the company's Mint resort.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett left Del Webb in 1971, with $5 million in stock options,
and teamed up with Reno's Bill Pennington to lease novelty electronic
gambling machines to casinos. In 1974, the two men leased the failing
Circus Circus with an option to buy, which they exercised shortly
before taking the company public in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   The businesslike Bennett focused on providing value at low prices
at the circus-themed hotel and casino, knowing that masses of people
spending even a few dollars each would translate into profits.</TE>
<TE>   He increased the number of slot machines and streamlined their
management, and kicked out those unscrupulous midway vendors who
angered customers by fleecing them.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, he sought out the Las Vegas-bound drivers without
hotel reservations by advertising widely and boldly on radio: "Rooms
available; if not, we'll place you."</TE>
<TE>   The partners added resorts in Reno and newly emerging Laughlin,
Nev., then built the $300-million Excalibur, with its King Arthur
theme, and the $375-million Luxor, replicating ancient Egyptian
temples, hieroglyphic inscriptions and even King Tutankhamen's tomb.</TE>
<TE>   After 20 years as chairman, Bennett was booted out in 1994 by
stockholders angry at declining stock prices and by management unrest
over his tight hold on the company reins.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, in a litigation battle over purchase of the
old Hacienda property south of the Luxor, he was also forced off the
Circus Circus Enterprises board.</TE>
<TE>   After Bennett's departure, the company used the acquired Hacienda
property as the site of its first upscale resort, Mandalay Bay, and
renamed itself Mandalay Resort Group.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Bennett sold his stock in Circus Circus for $230 million
and bought the Moroccan-themed Sahara for $193 million, then spent
$100 million to renovate it.</TE>
<TE>   With Ralph Engelstad, he also developed the $200-million Las Vegas
Motor Speedway. They sold the complex in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Forbes magazine listed Bennett as 368th on its list
of the 400 richest people in America, with a worth of $600 million.
His Bennett Foundation has given more than $10 million to the
University of Nevada at Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Bennett was one of the Strip's top profit-producers for
almost a 20-year stretch," Bill Thompson, casino industry expert and
UNLV professor, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal after Bennett's
death. "He cut costs everywhere, but he understood his market:
middle-class Americans. The regular guy can afford Las Vegas because
of guys like Bill Bennett."</TE>
<TE>   Widowed and remarried, Bennett is survived by his wife, Lynn; two
children, Diana and William A.; a stepdaughter, Laura Lynn; four
grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial donations may be made to the Bennett Foundation, 2535 Las
Vegas Blvd. South, Las Vegas, NV 89109.</TE>

<HD>City's Proposed No-Touch Rule in Strip Clubs Called Out of
Touch</HD>
<DH>Lake Forest says it wants to discourage prostitution and
drugs. One club calls the rule off-target and poison for business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City officials call it bureaucratic fine-tuning -- a proposed
ordinance banning close contact between topless dancers and customers
at two Lake Forest strip clubs.</LD>
<LD>   But to the dancers, bouncers and managers at Captain Cream, a
freeway-close adult club in the south Orange County community, the
ordinance could be a business killer.</LD>
<LD>   "The idea is not regulation but elimination," said Les Hawthorne,
the club's chief operating officer. "They hope the regulations would
restrict the way we do our business so that they would eventually
eliminate us."</LD>
<TE>   The proposed ordinance would ban physical contact between
entertainers and customers, such as the practice of dancers
sauntering through the largely male crowd, collecting tips. It would
also prohibit performers from getting within 6 feet of a patron, a
rule that threatens such club staples as "table dances."</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest officials say the ordinance, which comes before the
City Council on Jan. 21, is not meant to put Captain Cream or the
Library, a second Lake Forest club, out of business. The intent, they
say, is to eliminate activity that could lead to "secondary effects,"
such as prostitution or drug abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Management at the Library wouldn't comment, saying it would see
how such rules work out.</TE>
<TE>   Dancers at Captain Cream say the city is creating a double
standard.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you not allowed to tip the pizza delivery guy by handing him
money anymore?" said Nikki, 32, a single mother who has danced at
Captain Cream for two years. "Let's make it the same for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Once the ordinance took effect, patrons would be asked to drop
their tips in a jar at least 6 feet from the stage.</TE>
<TE>   The dancers say the freedom to mingle with customers is what
allows them to make a living in a job paid by tips only.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the city is wrong," said Shoni, 37, who says she has a
writing degree from Northwestern University and, like Nikki, prefers
to use only her first name. "We're being singled out for the way we
make our living."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hawthorne, "It's like paying to go into a baseball game and
then watching the game on a monitor."</TE>
<TE>   One regular, downing a beer on an afternoon at Captain Cream, said
the proposed ordinance shouldn't have a big effect there.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a low-contact strip club anyway," he said. "Those tips
they collect after the dances are almost like a tax. They come around
and almost everybody gives them a dollar."</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance would also require each dancer to be licensed before
working in such establishments.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's discriminating," said Shoni, one of more than 100
dancers employed by Captain Cream. She said the ordinance presupposes
that erotic dancing is decadent and leads to crime.</TE>
<TE>   Though city officials say their intent is not to run Captain Cream
or the Library out of town, they do hope to keep other adult
establishments from setting up shop in Lake Forest, a quiet
master-planned community of 60,000.</TE>
<TE>   In drafting the ordinance, the city reviewed court cases and
studied the effects of similar ordinances elsewhere. In 1999,
Anaheim's no-touch rule at several nude clubs was struck down by an
appeals court, which ruled that the ordinance went too far by
criminalizing such actions. Lake Forest officials, though, say their
proposed rules are legally sound.</TE>
<TE>   "By eliminating direct contact, studies show that secondary
effects are reduced," said Mark Pulone, Lake Forest's assistant city
manager. "We're simply trying to eliminate problems that might occur
in the future."</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sheriff's Department said the neighborhood
around Captain Cream gets, on average, the most police calls in the
city. But Jon Fleischman, a department spokesman, said it's unclear
what impact the new ordinance might have on law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Hawthorne said the concern that physical contact between dancers
and customers at his club might lead to prostitution or drug activity
is off-target. "Just because people come together for adult
entertainment doesn't mean they're interested in prostitution and
drugs," he said. "The concept is that anybody who comes here is so
low that they would only be interested in those things.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is that nobody here wants to get in trouble. The girls
are here to earn a living.... It's like a Cheers in Lake Forest."</TE>
<TE>   Nikki said she'll simply adapt if the ordinance passes. "I guess
I'll just have to get used to a tip jar."</TE>
<GT></GT>

says the intent of the ordinance is to shut down clubs like his. Lake
Forest officials deny that, though they do say they hope the
ordinance prevents more such clubs from opening.</CP>

<HD>Gene Patent Lawsuit Names Five California Firms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxford Gene Technology Ltd., a British biotechnology company, accused
five California rivals and two other companies of infringing a patent
for DNA sequencing that can help cure diseases and improve crops.</LD>
<LD>   Named in lawsuits by Oxford are BD Biosciences Clontech of Palo
Alto; Nanogen Inc. of San Diego; Axon Instruments Inc. of Union City;
Biodiscovery Inc. of Marina del Rey; and Mergen Ltd. of San Leandro.</LD>
<LD>   Oxford also sued PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc. of Boston and
Harvard Bioscience Inc. unit Genomic Solutions Inc. of Ann Arbor,
Mich.</LD>
<TE>   The seven companies don't have permission to use the technology,
patented in 2000, Oxford said in two federal lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The suits were filed in Delaware and made public Thursday and Dec.
18.</TE>
<TE>   Oxford says its rivals are using techniques invented by researcher
Edwin Southern for arranging gene strands on glass slides for
laboratory analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits ask for jury trials, unspecified damages and court
orders to stop the companies from using Southern's gene-chip
invention in their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Another company, Affymetrix Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., was sued
by Oxford in the same court in 1999 seeking damages over use of a
similar technology. Affymetrix settled all litigation in 2001, for a
$19-million charge.</TE>
<TE>   Mergen's director of business development, Jamie Love, said he was
"surprised" at Oxford's action, but couldn't comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the other companies were unavailable or unwilling to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Clontech parent Becton
Dickinson &amp; Co. closed unchanged at $30.49 and PerkinElmer rose 11
cents to close at $7.89. Harvard Bioscience rose 18 cents to $3.25
and Nanogen rose 16 cents to $1.51, both in Nasdaq trading.</TE>

<HD>Susan F. Marx, 94; Widow of Comedian Harpo Marx</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Susan Fleming Marx, a Ziegfeld Follies girl and film actress of the
1930s who appeared opposite John Wayne and W.C. Fields and later
married comedian Harpo Marx, has died. She was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Marx, who became a Palm Springs area politician and activist, died
Sunday in Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage after a heart
attack.</LD>
<LD>   In her youth, Susan Fleming aimed for the bright lights of
Broadway and danced her way into the biggest stage spots in the late
1920s. After appearing in Flo Ziegfeld's storied Follies revue, she
was asked to come west as John Wayne's love interest in the western
"Range Feud."</LD>
<TE>   She was soon dancing again, this time before Hollywood cameras, as
Fields' daughter in the 1932 comedy "Million Dollar Legs." As part of
the publicity campaign for the film, Fleming's legs were insured for
$1 million, said her friend, actress Gloria Stuart, of recent
"Titanic" fame.</TE>
<TE>   But Fleming disliked the Tinseltown routine. "There is nothing
more boring than working on a movie," she told Britain's Hello!
Magazine in 1995. "It took forever to get the lights sorted out. I
hated it!"</TE>
<TE>   Fortuitously, about the time Fleming decided she wanted little to
do with the film business, she found herself seated next to Adolph
"Harpo" Marx at a dinner party at the home of movie maker Samuel
Goldwyn. The dancer was captivated by the comedian, who was about 15
years her senior.</TE>
<TE>   Silent on screen while brothers Groucho and Chico kept up a fast
repartee, Marx in person, Fleming discovered, was "a warm, fun,
darling man to talk to ... [who] was wary of friendship."</TE>
<TE>   It took the young actress four years of dating the womanizing Marx
and three proposals -- all from her -- before they married on Sept.
28, 1936. (Marx died on their wedding anniversary in 1964 at age 70.)</TE>
<TE>   As Susan Marx, she gleefully abandoned her own career and became
what she described as her husband's "valet," touring with him and
cleaning his trademark curly wigs. She also reared the three sons and
one daughter they had adopted as babies.</TE>
<TE>   The Marx Brothers, who included managers Zeppo and Gummo, were
famous for such films as "Animal Crackers," "Monkey Business," "Go
West," "Duck Soup" and "A Night at the Opera." A few years after the
brothers made their final film together, "Love Happy" in 1949, Harpo
and Susan Marx relocated to Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his music -- he played piano, clarinet, violin,
trombone and cornet, as well as his trademark harp -- Harpo at his
wife's suggestion began painting.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Marx made elaborate wood frames for his paintings, drew and
painted her own artworks, and took care of their family.</TE>
<TE>   After Harpo Marx's death, she began building a career as a
community activist and official. By the time her husband died, Marx
had served three years as an elected member of the Palm Springs
Unified Board of Education.</TE>
<TE>   She was on the school board a total of 18 years, and once ran
unsuccessfully for a California Assembly seat. She also was active in
the League of Women Voters.</TE>
<TE>   Proud of the desert community as it existed, Marx was co-leader of
the Mountain Protective League, which tried to halt hillside
developments. After attending the College of the Desert, she became
an advisory planning commissioner for Rancho Mirage.</TE>
<TE>   As a philanthropist, Marx donated generously to desert-area
charities and gave parts of the art collections she had built with
her husband to museums as far away as the Heritage Center Museum in
Lancaster, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   For many years she worked to complete a book-length manuscript,
although it never found a publisher. Titled "Go Tell," the
autobiography covered her marriage to Harpo Marx, rearing their
children, and her years as a widow.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Marx is survived by three sons, Bill, Alexander and Jim
Marx; a daughter, Minnie Eagle; five grandchildren; and two
great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   No funeral is planned.</TE>

<LD>Two hikers who were exploring steep canyons east of Orange were
rescued by helicopter Thursday, shaken but unhurt after they got lost
and used a cell phone to call for help.</LD>
<LD>   Rick Lloyd, 47, and John Parrini, 46, both of Orange, set out for
a day hike after leaving their car about 8 a.m. near Black Star
Canyon, said Officer Mark Reeves of the California Highway Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   They told rescuers they were hiking toward the east side of
Pleasants Peak but got disoriented.</LD>
<TE>   Seven hours later and out of water, they called for help and
contacted a CHP office, which dispatched a helicopter from Fullerton
Municipal Airport.</TE>
<TE>   With temperatures dropping to the low 30s, the hikers were found
about 4:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves said the hikers told the dispatcher where the helicopter
was in relation to their position based on the sound of its engine.
The dispatcher then relayed the information to the pilot.</TE>

The names of the victims were not available Thursday. The cause of

<HD>Property-Tax Suit: It's About Doing the Math</HD>
<DH>An O.C. judge ruled that the method county assessors use
violates Prop. 13. If upheld on appeal, decision could cost state
billions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco and Phil Willon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a quarter-century after California voters revolted against
soaring property taxes by approving Proposition 13, a court battle
over a single paragraph in the measure could mean thousands of
dollars in tax refunds for individual homeowners and the loss of
billions in revenue for the cash-strapped state.</LD>
<LD>   An Orange County Superior Court judge has ruled that the method
local tax assessors have used for years to set property-tax rates
violated the 1978 landmark ballot initiative. If upheld on appeal,
the decision could lead to the biggest property-tax break since the
birth of Proposition 13.</LD>
<LD>   The case boils down to a basic question: What exactly did
Proposition 13 mean when it limited increases in property assessments
to 2% a year?</LD>
<TE>   County assessors around California have one interpretation. Tax
attorney Robert Pool had another, and he filed a lawsuit against
Orange County after the assessment on his $330,000 Seal Beach home
jumped 4% in 1999. He argued the increase clearly violated the
easy-to-understand language of Proposition 13, and in December 2001
Judge John M. Watson agreed. Last week, the judge turned the case
into a class-action suit, potentially extending any tax refunds to
millions of homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   "A victory for Pool would be a victory for taxpayers statewide.
It's not the government's money. It's the people's money," said Jon
Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., the anti-tax
organization founded by Proposition 13's author, Howard Jarvis.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Coupal and other tax experts said the potential effect of
Pool's lawsuit is muddied by legal complexities, and homeowners
banking on an eventual tax refund may find themselves sorely
disappointed. Even if Pool prevails on appeal, the state Legislature
may ultimately decide how tax refunds would be dished out.</TE>
<TE>   Before California voters approved Proposition 13 in June 1978,
assessments were based on a property's "fair market value, " and the
skyrocketing housing market was triggering mammoth property-tax
increases for many residents.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13 limited annual property-tax increases to 1% of the
assessed property value and prohibited counties from increasing a
property assessment more than 2% a year. The measure also mandated
that all future tax increases would be added to a base value defined
as the purchase price or, if in the hands of the same owner since
Proposition 13 was approved, the property's assessed value in the
1975-76 tax year.</TE>
<TE>   A companion ballot initiative, Proposition 8, passed in November
1978. It refined Proposition 13 to allow property values to be
reduced in a declining market.</TE>
<TE>   The much-argued paragraph at the heart of the matter, now part of
the state Constitution, reads: "The full cash value base may reflect
from year to year the inflationary rate not to exceed 2 percent for
any given year or reduction as shown in the consumer price index or
comparable data for the area under taxing jurisdiction, or may be
reduced to reflect substantial damage, destruction or other factors
causing a decline in value."</TE>
<TE>   This bureaucratic prose was put under the microscope in the Pool
case.</TE>
<TE>   Pool said the language in the Constitution is clear and must be
followed: The county is prohibited from raising a resident's property
assessment by more than 2% above the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   An example is what happened to Alan Lavallee of Buena Park. Though
not involved in the Pool lawsuit, Lavallee is among those closely
watching the issue. He complains his assessment jumped an average of
more than 9% per year in the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   "No one really understands what's been happening, what the county
has been doing," said Lavallee, who believes his last property-tax
bill overcharged him by about $1,600. "The county has really screwed
up."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Assessor Webster J. Guillory and state tax officials
said the language can be interpreted differently. He said the
Proposition 13 limit on a property-assessment increases at a rate of
2% every year from the time the property is purchased. That cap
continues to rise, no matter what. And a county is allowed to
increase assessments at any rate -- for instance, to catch up after
years of declines -- so long as the value remains under that cap,
they contend.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a $100,000 home purchased this year can have a
maximum assessment of $102,000 in 2003; a maximum assessment of
$104,040 in 2004; a maximum assessment of $106,120 in 2005; and a
maximum assessment of $108,242 in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Even if a flat housing market forces the county to keep the home's
assessment at $100,000 until 2005, the county can increase the
property assessment to $108,242 in 2006 if the market fully recovers
-- even though that is more than an 8% increase, Guillory argues.</TE>
<TE>   "All I'm doing is following the market, and I'm following the
market back to cap," he said. "Proposition 13 instructs you to follow
the market."</TE>
<TE>   Lowered assessments -- allowed by the passage of Proposition 8 --
are temporary, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, assessors treat a drop in property value the same way
they treat homes damaged by a disaster. When a house is significantly
damaged, the owner can apply to have the county lower the assessment
on the property. When repairs are complete, the house is reassessed
to the value of the property before the disaster -- even if the
assessment increase is greater than 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Under Pool's interpretation of the law, Guillory argued, a
homeowner whose house is gutted by a fire would only pay property
taxes based on the assessed value of the charred remains, even after
the home was restored.</TE>
<TE>   The case, which is expected to head to the state 4th District
Court of Appeal this winter, is being watched closely throughout the
state. All 58 counties in California use the same method for
determining property-tax assessments. Orange County tax officials
said that if the ruling is upheld and applies to all taxpayers, the
county might have to refund up to $1 billion. Los Angeles County
officials said the cost there could be as high as $4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two different readings of two different clauses in the
Constitution. I don't think this is a frivolous case at all," said
Paul Steinberg, senior tax counsel for the state Board of
Equalization.</TE>
<TE>   But legal opinions are far from unanimous. Though a judge ruled
for the plaintiff in Orange County, a judge in Los Angeles County
dismissed a similar case in April, finding that the method being used
by county assessors is constitutional. "You've got a lot of
uncertainties on this. We didn't even attempt to assess the impact,"
Steinberg said. "It's way too premature."</TE>
<TE>   Even if courts find in favor of the plaintiffs, the ultimate
effect is hard to predict. To begin with, California has a three- or
four-year statute of limitations on claiming tax refunds. In the
Orange County case, the judge has one final element of the case to
decide. He is expected to rule Jan. 30 on how taxpayers should be
notified that they could be due a refund. He said he will suspend his
ruling to allow the case to move ahead on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Coupal said that if the state appellate courts uphold Pool's court
victory, then every single assessor in California would be inundated
with claims for property-tax refunds. To avoid that bureaucratic
nightmare, the state Legislature would probably be forced to rush in
with some sort of remedy to streamline the process, he said.</TE>

<HD>Kenneth Tobey, 85; Star of 1950s Science-Fiction Movies,
Early TV Series</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Kenneth Tobey, who co-starred in the 1950s science-fiction classic
"The Thing From Another World" and the '50s television series "The
Whirlybirds," has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran character actor and B-movie hero died Sunday at a
Rancho Mirage hospital after a lengthy illness.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning with a small part in "Dangerous Venture" -- a 1947
Hopalong Cassidy western -- Tobey appeared in nearly 100 films,
including "12 O'Clock High," "The Wings of Eagles," "Gunfight at the
OK Corral," "Billy Jack," "MacArthur," "The Candidate" and
"Airplane!," the disaster-movie spoof in which he played one of the
air-traffic controllers.</LD>
<TE>   Tobey, who often portrayed authority figures, showed up frequently
on television, appearing in everything from "Perry Mason" to "L.A.
Law."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, he played one of his most colorful characters -- one
of Mike Fink's river rats, the pugnacious, cigar-chomping Jocko -- on
Walt Disney's "Davy Crockett" series, starring Fess Parker -- as well
as turning up as Jim Bowie in the series' Alamo segment.</TE>
<TE>   From 1957 to '59, Tobey co-starred with Craig Hill in "The
Whirlybirds," a syndicated half-hour adventure series in which they
played partners in a Southern California helicopter-for-hire
business.</TE>
<TE>   Something of a contemporary version of the TV westerns that were
the rage at the time, "The Whirlybirds" was heavy on stunts. The
stars -- or at least their stunt doubles -- were known to hang from
the end of a rope to rescue a client or jump from their chopper onto
the back of a fleeing bad guy on horseback.</TE>
<TE>   But Tobey is best remembered by science-fiction fans for his
leading role in "The Thing From Another World," the 1951 film in
which he plays an Air Force captain who is summoned to a government
installation at the North Pole after a UFO crashes nearby. The UFO's
occupant -- the monstrous, vegetable-like "thing," played by a
then-unknown James Arness -- later begins killing the scientists.</TE>
<TE>   "Kenneth Tobey was the first -- and one of the best -- of the
great sci-fi movie heroes of the 1950s," film historian Tom Weaver,
who interviewed Tobey for Fangoria magazine in 1993, told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Tobey later played an Army colonel in "The Beast From 20,000
Fathoms" (1953) and a Navy commander in "It Came From Beneath the
Sea" (1955).</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the other sci-fi heroes of the '50s were scientists or
eggheads," Weaver said, "but Tobey always represented the military,
and in such a hard-nosed, no-nonsense style that you knew as soon as
he came on and started barking orders that the monsters had probably
bitten off more than they could chew."</TE>
<TE>   Tobey's small role in director Howard Hawks' comedy "I Was a Male
War Bride" in 1949 so impressed Hawks that when he was producing "The
Thing," he cast the red-haired actor.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Cornthwaite, who played the lead scientist in "The Thing,"
recalled that Hawks had wanted "a cast of complete unknowns" for the
A-budget picture.</TE>
<TE>   "He felt it gave the audience a sense of greater reality,"
Cornthwaite told The Times, recalling that Tobey "had a wonderful,
understated kind of style" as an actor.</TE>
<TE>   "He always played everything keyed way down," said Cornthwaite,
"but he made a very effective thing out of it, I thought."</TE>
<TE>   Before he could be cast, however, Tobey had to be approved by
Howard Hughes, then the RKO Studios owner.</TE>
<TE>   In his interview with Weaver, Tobey recalled that one of Hughes'
aides called him at 2:30 a.m., saying Hughes wanted to see him "now."
When Tobey protested that he had been sleeping, the aide insisted.
And rather than risk not getting the part, Tobey drove over to a
small office across the street from RKO to meet Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   "I walked in and he stared at me, looked me up and down and said,
'OK,' " Tobey recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Oakland, Tobey began dabbling in acting while working on a
degree in political science at UC Berkeley in the late '30s. After
moving to New York, he studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where
his classmates included Gregory Peck, Eli Wallach and Tony Randall.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the 1940s, he performed in stock and on Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, Tobey's "The Thing" claim-to-fame paid unexpected
dividends.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Davis Jr., a fan of the film, ran into the actor at an L.A.
jazz club. That led to Tobey's return to Broadway in 1964 to play the
fight manager in Davis' musical version of "Golden Boy."</TE>
<TE>   And director Joe Dante, another fan of "The Thing," cast Tobey in
small parts in "Gremlins," "Gremlins 2," "The Howling" and
"Innerspace."</TE>
<TE>   Tobey is survived by a daughter, a stepson, a stepdaughter, two
grandchildren and a brother.</TE>
<TE>   Services are pending.</TE>

<HD>Pitino Enjoys Other Side of Rivalry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>The one thing Rick Pitino has learned from the other side of the
Louisville-Kentucky rivalry is that Cardinal fans don't take their
annual meeting nearly as seriously as Wildcat fans.</LD>
<LD>   Pitino doesn't either.</LD>
<LD>   "Here, it's not life and death. There, it's life and death," said
Pitino, the Louisville coach who used to have the same job at
Kentucky. "Here, it's a game people look forward to, they all want to
win, they're all charged. But they're not going to go home and stand
out in the cold for hours if they don't."</LD>
<TE>   Pitino was relaxed and smiling as he talked about Saturday's game
between his Cardinals (6-1) and the 14th-ranked Wildcats (6-2) at
Freedom Hall.</TE>
<TE>   He was much more stressed before last year's game, which marked
his first appearance at Rupp Arena since he left Kentucky for the
Boston Celtics in 1997. Pitino coached the Wildcats for eight seasons
and led them to the 1995-96 national title.</TE>
<TE>   Pitino acknowledged that he was saddened by how Kentucky fans
received him, but he remains a fan of the program.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not one for bitter rivalries, I'm one for great rivalries,"
he said. "Certainly, I want Kentucky to lose this Saturday, but
outside of that, I root for them."</TE>

<LD>   UC Santa Barbara (3-5) vs. Nebraska (4-4) at Tempe, Ariz., 4 --
The Gauchos have struggled on the road as they try to win the opening
game of the azcentral.com/ASU Hoops Classic. Santa Barbara has lost
three in a row since defeating USC on Dec. 3. Junior guard Nick Jones
is having a breakout season, averaging 15.8 points and 6.8 rebounds.
Junior transfer Andrew Drevo leads Nebraska in scoring (14.7) and
rebounding (9.3).</LD>

<TE>   USC (5-5) at Oregon State (6-3), 7 -- USC begins Pacific 10
Conference play in a familiar position -- on the road. This will be
the Trojans' fifth consecutive game away from the Sports Arena and
their seventh road game this season. The Beavers are 5-0 at home this
season, with their most impressive victory coming against Florida.
But Oregon State has also dropped its last six conference openers.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (5-4) at Oregon (4-5), 7, KBET (850), KTDD (1350) -- The
Bruins have a lot of proving to do in the Pac-10, having gone 9-23 in
conference play the last two seasons. But Oregon has the kind of big
frontcourt that gives undersized UCLA problems. The Ducks are still
adjusting to the loss of senior guard Shaquala Williams, who was
dismissed by Coach Bev Smith for disciplinary reasons. But they have
also won six of the last seven games against the Bruins, and four
straight on their home court.</TE>

<LD>After sitting out two games because of a calf strain, Elton Brand
practiced Thursday and is expected to play tonight against the
Phoenix Suns. Quentin Richardson and Andre Miller practiced and are
expected to play, despite sprained ankles. Corey Maggette, recovering
from knee surgery, practiced and was cleared to play by team doctor
Tony Daly.</LD>
<LD>   Lamar Odom practiced and is scheduled to play for the first time
in 11 months Saturday against the Golden State Warriors, although it
sounded as if he were still trying to persuade anyone who would
listen that he would be OK to play tonight at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Said Brand, who leads the Clippers with averages of 18.7 points,
11.6 rebounds and 3.2 blocks, "I'm optimistic, I'm hopeful. Corey's
back. Lamar's coming back. It's exciting to have everybody back on
the floor. We practiced today and we had substitutes and everything."</LD>
<TE>   It's been awhile since the Clippers were that fit and healthy,
perhaps before training camp began Oct. 1. They haven't had their
starting lineup together since Odom sprained his right wrist and,
later, his right ankle and went on the injured list Jan. 24. Every
member of the starting five this season, plus sixth man Richardson,
has been sidelined by injury for at least one game.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are at a pivotal point in the season, and to a
degree, in the franchise's future. More victories could translate
into a winning record and a playoff berth by season's end.</TE>
<TE>   Success for the team also could mean happy futures for several key
free agents, among them Brand, Maggette, Miller and Odom -- all
restricted free agents. Michael Olowokandi, an unrestricted free
agent, is expected to sign elsewhere next summer.</TE>
<TE>   "We play better, the team goes farther, maybe even gets to the
playoffs, it's good for everybody," Brand said. "We've got a lot of
home games coming up. We've got to get back in the playoff race."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Piatkowski was moved to the injured list because of a lower
abdominal strain, thereby opening a roster spot for Maggette, who had
arthroscopic knee surgery Nov. 29. Sean Rooks, who has bronchitis,
did not join the team for its trip to Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Phoenix, 6 PST</TE>
<TE>   Site -- America West Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Clippers 12-16, Suns 17-11.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Suns -- 0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Phoenix has won three consecutive games, one of them
Friday over the Clippers at Staples Center, and seven of 10, ranking
as one of the league's bigger surprises. The Clippers fell behind by
19 points in the teams' last meeting before rallying late to make the
87-76 final score look better.</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>If you believe the oddsmakers, tonight's 25th edition of the Holiday
Bowl is the biggest mismatch of the bowl season.</LD>
<LD>   The Kansas State Wildcats (10-2 and ranked sixth) are 18-point
favorites over the Arizona State Sun Devils (8-5 and losers of three
of their last four games). Of the two-dozen-plus bowl games, no other
comes close to being rated as lopsided as the game at Qualcomm
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   But while his players were enjoying Sea World, the San Diego Zoo
and other tourist delights, Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder was
watching game films and came away impressed with a young Arizona
State team. As a hedge against overconfidence, he made sure his
players got the same viewing.</LD>
<TE>   "If any of them misunderstand this, we'll have to sit down and
take IQ tests," Snyder said. "They watch the same tape I do, and
unless they're sound asleep, they see what I see."</TE>
<TE>   It appears to be a game of contrasts: an established football
power versus a rising star, a dean of coaching versus a coach who
looks barely older his players, a ground attack versus a passing
game. Take a 17-14 loss to Texas out of the mix and Kansas State
averaged 48.5 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Ell Roberson ran for 13 touchdowns and passed for six
more; running back Darren Sproles averaged 6.2 yards a carry and
scored 16 touchdowns. "It's the trifecta" of offenses, Arizona State
Coach Dirk Koetter said admiringly.</TE>
<TE>   While Kansas State is loaded with veterans, Arizona State has only
four seniors among its starters. All-American defensive end Terrell
Suggs, a junior, set an NCAA Division I record with 22 sacks, and
quarterback Andrew Walter, a sophomore, threw for 3,584 yards with 26
touchdown passes and in nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kansas State has one of the stingiest defenses in the
country, allowing only 10.6 points a game. Senior cornerback Terence
Newman won the Jim Thorpe Award as the nation's best defensive back.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning he was a speed guy who played football," Snyder
said. "Now he's grown into a football player who happens to be fast."</TE>
<TE>   For Arizona State, a trip to San Diego was an unexpected reward
after a season that began with a 48-10 thumping by Nebraska and ended
with a third-place finish in the Pacific 10 Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not a great season, but it was a successful season,"
said Koetter, in his second year at Tempe. "When you're picked ninth
in the league and you finish third and get to come to the Holiday
Bowl, that's a success."</TE>
<TE>   For Kansas State, bowl appearances are routine. This is the
Wildcats' 10th straight, including victories at the Holiday Bowl in
1995 (54-21 over Colorado State) and 1999 (24-20 over Washington).</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats had hoped for a bowl championship series invitation
to the Orange Bowl. Instead, Iowa (11-1) got the at-large berth to
face USC (10-2).</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason for the long odds comes from how each team
fared against USC. Kansas State beat USC, 27-20, in Manhattan. But
the Sun Devils lost to the Trojans, 34-13, at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Talk of a mismatch has not riled Koetter. Holiday Bowl history
leans toward high-scoring games and unexpected finishes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to go out and fire our guns and hope for the best,"
Koetter said.</TE>

<HD>Otis Makes Quick Impact in Return to Dominguez</HD>
<DH>His team loses to Fairfax, 64-61, in his first game but
serves notice it won't repeat last season's dismal showing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ENCINITAS</DL>
<LD>Russell Otis returned to coaching Thursday and, if nothing else, one
thing became obvious -- Compton Dominguez High isn't far from
becoming a good team.</LD>
<LD>   Dominguez lost to Fairfax, 64-61, and while nobody is saying the
Dons should reserve room for another state championship banner, it
appears the dreary 15-12 mark of last season is part of the past.</LD>
<LD>   Otis was on the sideline for the first time in almost two years,
wearing a black sweater, black slacks and black dress shoes in front
of a sparse crowd of about 200 at a first-round game of the Encinitas
Torrey Pines tournament. He has been with the team for two weeks,
since the Compton Unified School District board approved his rehiring
in a highly charged 4-3 vote on Dec. 10.</LD>
<TE>   A little more than two years ago, Otis was arrested and charged
with sexually molesting a former player, allegations that became
public in November 2000. Within months, Otis was fired by the
state-appointed leader of the Compton school district for lacking a
permanent teaching credential, a detail that had never before been an
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Otis, 40, was acquitted of all charges, but his request for
reinstatement at Dominguez was initially denied. Last year, he taught
at Gardena but did not coach.</TE>
<TE>   Otis conducted open tryouts upon his return in order to bolster
the Dons' roster, a stunning necessity on a campus that never lacked
for basketball players and won four state championships.</TE>
<TE>   After the Dons (2-3) scared Fairfax (10-0), Otis said the future
was foremost on his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good feeling for me to be back, doing what I love to be
doing," Otis said. "It didn't feel like I was away.</TE>
<TE>   "Give us a few days. We only had four or five days of practice. I
tell [the players], 'Listen to me and we're going to be all right.' "</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez used to be a magnet for top players, among them 7-foot
Tyson Chandler, who made the jump from Dominguez directly to the
Chicago Bulls after the Dons won the state championship in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The program foundered immediately without Otis.</TE>
<TE>   Players defected to other schools. The team became ordinary,
losing more games last season than the previous three seasons
combined. Mack Calvin, a former NBA player, lasted one season as
coach and abruptly resigned a month before the Dons began practice
this season.</TE>
<TE>   There are noticeable differences in Otis' return.</TE>
<TE>   The Nike swoosh, a familiar sight during Dominguez's days of
dominance, was all but absent on the Dons' bench Thursday. Players
wore a variety of shoes and displayed little evidence of the sneaker
giant that sponsored Dominguez for nearly seven years until Otis'
dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in the 12-team elite division of the tournament, Dominguez
was thoroughly outsized against Fairfax, but almost outplayed the
Lions, who are No. 2 in The Times' rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez trailed the entire game, but a free throw by Travon Free
put the Dons ahead, 57-56, with 1:46 remaining. The Dons pushed the
lead to 61-58 on a drive by Jason Murdock with one minute left, but
Kevin Bell scored six points in the final minute -- a three-pointer
and three free throws -- to ensure a Fairfax victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt good to finally be under the order of Coach Otis," said
Free, a senior forward and the team's top player. "The way he teaches
and instructs, you learn so much in such a short time. When I found
out he was coming back, it took a mountain of pressure off me."</TE>
<TE>   Free, who has committed to Long Beach State, scored 24 points for
Dominguez. Jamal Boykin had 20 points and Alex Bausley had 12 for
Fairfax.</TE>

<LD>Selecting a team captain is not a precise science for high school
coaches.</LD>
<LD>   Some let their players vote. Others choose a captain based on
leadership skills demonstrated in preseason workouts.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly Clark, the football coach at Traverse City Central High in
Michigan, has come up with an elaborate process for choosing
captains.</LD>
<TE>   First, he's requiring players to apply for the position.</TE>
<TE>   He posted the job on the football display case: "Leaders wanted,
apply here."</TE>
<TE>   Among the job qualifications are "commitment to leadership,
off-season commitment to strength and conditioning program,
possession of mental toughness in difficult situations, maintaining
emotional flexibility, maintaining emotional strength."</TE>
<TE>   Players interested in the position had to submit a resume, then
show up in suit and tie to endure a 20-minute interview process
before a panel of coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve players applied, 11 juniors and one sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   "One kid thought it was real dumb," Clark said. "A lot have come
up [and said], 'Yeah, that was a great idea.' "</TE>
<TE>   Clark said poor leadership by captains in the past caused him to
resort to closer scrutiny in the selection process.</TE>
<TE>   "When they get up after their interview, you can see the back of
their chair has sweat and you shake their hands and it's a little
sweaty," he said. "They're fielding some tough questions."</TE>
<TE>   Clark will make his decision early next year.</TE>

<TE>   Baseball scouts already are polishing their radar guns in
anticipation of an expected March 7 showdown at Glendora High between
two of the top left-handed pitchers in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes as planned, the opening night game of the Glendora
tournament will feature Cal State Fullerton-bound Chuck Tiffany of
Covina Charter Oak pitching against Long Beach State-bound Brandon
Villalobos of Glendora. The next night, Crescenta Valley, with
sophomore right-hander Trevor Bell, will take on two-time defending
Division IV champion La Puente Bishop Amat.</TE>
<TE>   As for Tiffany, Charter Oak Coach Richard Escalera said, "He's
really come around immensely. He's going to be throwing 94, 95 miles
per hour. He's one of those special kids."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Delmon Young of Camarillo High is ranked No. 2 among
the top 350 prospects for 2003 by Baseball America magazine. Pitcher
Jared Hughes of Santa Margarita is No. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Other top Southern California prospects include No. 36 Ian Stewart
of Westminster La Quinta, No. 37 Tiffany, No. 40 Ian Kennedy of
Westminster La Quinta, No. 46 Brennan Boesch of North Hollywood
Harvard-Westlake and No. 69 Jo Jo Reyes of Riverside Poly.</TE>

<TE>   Bill Griffin, who was the key blocker for tailback Tyler Ebell
when Ebell set a national single-season rushing record in 2000 at
Ventura High, has signed with Florida. Griffin started at center for
Ventura College this season.</TE>

<TE>   Recruiting and integrity are two words that don't usually go
together, but they describe UCLA assistant football coach Gary
Bernardi, who just completed his ninth season with the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Bernardi, who also has worked at USC, is waiting to see if new
Coach Karl Dorrell retains him. The high school coaches who have
worked with Bernardi know his value. And the parents who have
welcomed him into their homes know his word means something.</TE>

<TE>   It's not too early to promote West Covina as one of the most
underrated boys' basketball teams. Under Coach Boston Shima, the
Bulldogs won the El Monte Arroyo and Chino Hills Ayala tournament
championships.</TE>
<TE>   West Covina (7-3) has only one player in its rotation taller than
6-foot-1. It's a senior-dominated team that plays excellent
man-to-man defense and relies on the strong guard play of Corey
McIntosh (Arroyo tournament MVP), Kevin Avar (Ayala tournament MVP)
and Jabir Jinna.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs also have a female assistant coach, Monica Peters,
who's the sister of former Pepperdine player Jelani Gardner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What has happened to Los Angeles Manual Arts, which used to
compete on a yearly basis for the City boys' basketball championship?
The Toilers are 2-8 and have lost games by 49 and 51 points this
season.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday morning in the Hart tournament, only five players
showed up for a 9 a.m. game. Coach Greg Brewnick missed the game
because of a back injury. Two assistants ran the team.</TE>
<TE>   Manual Arts won City titles most recently in 1981, 1990 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   There's no excuse for this proud program to slip to such a
mediocre level.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>To the surprise of no one, Humorous Lady's winning streak ended at
four Oct. 26 at Arlington Park.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-year-old Distorted Humor filly finished 21 1/2 lengths
behind winner Storm Flag Flying after setting the pace in the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. What was stunning to some was that
she didn't finish last. Humorous Lady beat two fillies home in the
field of 10, one of them the $1.9-million purchase Atlantic Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   Cutting back in distance today, Humorous Lady will probably be
favored to start a new streak in the $125,000 California Breeders'
Champion Stakes at Santa Anita. The race is the fifth leg of a pick
six with a carry-over of $195,156.</LD>
<TE>   Now trained by Mike Smith, after having been purchased privately
by the Classic Star Stable, the dark bay filly has won four of five
around one turn, but the California Breeders' will mark her first
attempt at seven furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Heat Haze, a half-sister of Grade I winner Banks
Hill, will make her U.S. debut for trainer Bobby Frankel in today's
third at Santa Anita. The about 6 1/2-furlong turf race also lured
nine other fillies and mares.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Javier Castellano. The jockey leads the standings at
Aqueduct and is winning at about a 30% clip.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Paulino Ortiz. The New York trainer is two for 45 this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Severo in the fifth,
using Ec Lady, Rich Musique, Shezasummerbreeze and Doc's Lil' Angel
in the sixth and Global Finance, Humorous Lady, Jaciro and Buttertart
in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/1. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $7.20/$7.20. Total money bet: $18.</TE>

<HD>Miree, Pittsburgh Run Past Oregon St.</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Oregon State's Steven Jackson got the pregame attention. Pittsburgh's
Brandon Miree got the most valuable player award and the victory.</LD>
<LD>   Miree rushed for 113 yards, including a seven-yard touchdown run,
as the 24th-ranked Panthers defeated the Beavers, 38-13, Thursday
night in the Insight Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson, the Pacific 10 Conference's leading rusher and No. 4
nationally with 1,656 yards, managed a season-low 34 yards in 19
carries. Overall, Oregon State gained only eight rushing yards.</LD>
<TE>   "Him being such a great running back and with the great line they
had, we just came out and met the challenge," said Panther defensive
end Claude Harriott, who had two sacks and four tackles for loss.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson had gained fewer than 100 yards in only three games, but
broke loose only once against Pittsburgh, a 60-yard gain that was
called back because of a holding penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State Coach Dennis Erickson said he was surprised at how
ineffective the running game was.</TE>
<TE>   "They played very physical against us," Erickson said. "It did
surprise me, because I thought we could run the football against most
people, and we couldn't tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh (9-4) eventually overpowered Oregon State (8-5).</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they were a tough defense, No. 10 in the nation coming
in," Miree said. "But we felt we were a physical football team. We've
been physical with all the teams that we played this year."</TE>
<TE>   The victory made the Big East 2-0 in bowl games, something that
Panther Coach Walt Harris was quick to point out.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people cannot ever refer to it as the Big Easy anymore,"
Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Fitzgerald made a highlight catch for a 40-yard touchdown to
give the Panthers a 7-0 lead.</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Makes Vow After Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If his outing with the guys the night before his wedding didn't go
quite as planned, Shaquille O'Neal went ahead anyway with plans to
wed Shaunie Nelson at a secret place and time Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Most of his teammates were planning to attend. Guests were told
only hours before the ceremony where to go. As Mark Madsen put it
Thursday morning, "We know, but it's only for us."</LD>
<LD>   Not that this was a perfectly fortuitous moment in O'Neal's
professional career. The ceremony, later revealed to be held at the
Beverly Hills Hotel, was a day after the Lakers' 105-99 Christmas
loss to the Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers gathered briefly Thursday morning and watched a tape of
the game. Most left before reporters got there, O'Neal among them.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq took the loss yesterday as a loss," said Madsen. "He's a guy
who bounces back from things. He's our leader and he's someone who's
going to find a way to turn this thing around.</TE>
<TE>   "And at the same time, today is a new day and he's looking forward
to his wedding with Shaunie and he's excited about it.... "</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson says the Laker defense is being hurt by bad
Laker offense: turnovers that lead to fastbreaks, fast shots that
lead to long rebounds and more fastbreaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I was on Kobe [Bryant] a little bit today," Jackson said. "He was
stripped going through the lane two or three times, never made an
attempt to get back on defense.... You just can't argue with the
officials at that point."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings swarmed O'Neal with two and often three players. Jackson
said that's what you get in rivalries, where the teams know each
other thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, Shaquille ... can come out and get 35 in the game against
Denver Saturday night, and everybody thinks that's the end of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "But with [Vlade] Divac hanging on him and with [Chris] Webber,
it's an entirely different thing from other teams we're going to face
in this league.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, this is a team that's played us, what, 30 times in the
last three years? [Actually 28.] We understand the personnel."</TE>

<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Boston College played like a team on a mission.</LD>
<LD>   Brian St. Pierre led the Eagles to touchdowns on their first six
possessions and Boston College routed Toledo, 51-25, in the Motor
City Bowl on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   St. Pierre completed 25 of 35 passes for a career-high 342 yards
and three touchdowns as Boston College (9-4) capped one of the most
successful four-year runs in school history.</LD>
<TE>   The Eagles' senior class, which includes St. Pierre, won its 32nd
game, tying the 1981-84 group for the most victories in a four-year
span in the past 60 years.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College became the ninth team in school history to win at
least nine games and the first since 1993. It also appeared in a bowl
game for a fourth consecutive season. The Eagles are 32-17 over that
span.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first got here, I would have never believed that we could
go to four straight bowls and win the last three," St. Pierre said.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo (9-5) wasn't able to take advantage of a partisan crowd at
Detroit's new Ford Field, which is located about an hour north of the
Rockets' campus.</TE>
<TE>   "They won the battles in the trenches on both sides of the ball
and that's what won them the game," Toledo Coach Tom Amstutz said.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo left tackle Nick Kaczur was ejected near the end of the
first half for twice punching Boston College defensive end Phil
Mettling during a scrum after a two-point conversion by the Rockets
made it 42-18.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the teams were not allowed to go into the tunnel
together at halftime. Officials halted the Rockets near the end zone
as Boston College's players made their way into the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   A second Toledo player, defensive back Brock Dodrill, was ejected
early in the third quarter when he hit St. Pierre out of bounds.</TE>

<HD>Slumping Hawks React by Firing Kruger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atlanta Hawk General Manager Pete Babcock tried to talk himself out
of firing his coach, but another lackluster effort by the team
earlier in the week sealed Lon Kruger's fate.</LD>
<LD>   Kruger was fired Thursday by the slumping Hawks, three days after
the team lost by 15 points at Indiana. That was part of six losses in
seven games, with all six by at least 10 points.</LD>
<LD>   "We just fell back into a poor effort," Babcock said. "I didn't
want to make a change on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, and I tried
to convince myself it still could work.</LD>
<TE>   "But we're not maximizing our potential, and we needed to do
this."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Terry Stotts will take Kruger's spot, and Alex English
was promoted from director of player development to assistant coach.</TE>
<TE>   Gar Heard, who joined the Hawks as an assistant shortly after
Kruger was hired in 2000, also was dismissed. Atlanta is 11-16 this
season.</TE>
<TE>   The news came hours after the Atlanta Thrashers, a team also owned

president of both teams, said the timing was coincidental.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess when you talk about wins and losses, we haven't gotten
the job done, and so it didn't really come as a surprise," Kruger

<TE>   Washington Wizard forward Jared Jeffries will sit out the rest of
his rookie season after tearing a ligament in his right knee.
Jeffries was averaging 4.0 points, 2.9 rebounds and 15 minutes a

about six weeks with a broken left hand after injuring it Wednesday
against the Lakers.</TE>

<TE>   Dallas 83, New Orleans 81 -- Dirk Nowitzki scored 23 points at New
Orleans, and the Maverick defense was again good enough to overcome
one of its lowest-scoring outputs of the season. The Mavericks shot
37.8% and failed to surpass 92 points for the fourth straight game.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 97, Toronto 88 -- Gary Payton scored 35 points at Seattle

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pete Sampras, who recently said that he will play at least one more
tennis season, will compete in next summer's Mercedes-Benz Cup at the
Los Angeles Tennis Center.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras has not played a competitive match since defeating Andre
Agassi for the U.S. Open title in September and will skip the
Australian Open next month before beginning his 16th season on the
tour.</LD>
<LD>   The Mercedes Benz Cup will be played July 25-Aug. 3 and Sampras
will try to win the tournament for the third time. He won titles in
1991 and 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Agassi has won the tournament the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras, who has won a record 14 Grand Slam singles titles, did
not play in the tournament last year. He was a finalist in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Lance Armstrong, who went from having a 50% chance to live because
of cancer in 1996 to four straight Tour de France cycling
championships, was named the Associated Press male athlete of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong and Barry Bonds were the top two vote-getters for a
second straight year, only this time the San Francisco Giant star
finished second. Armstrong received 45 first-place votes and 292
points from sports writers and broadcasters. Bonds had 31 first-place
votes and 233 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Uh-oh, hopefully he's not mad," Armstrong said, referring to
Bonds. "It's nice to be recognized."</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods, who won the award 1999 and 2000, finished third for
the second year in a row. He received seven first-place votes and 110
points.</TE>
<TE>   Winning one Tour would have secured Armstrong's place in cycling
history. Capturing four in row has put him among the greatest riders
ever.</TE>
<TE>   A victory in 2003 -- the 100th anniversary of the race -- would
tie the record of five. Spain's Miguel Indurain (1991 to '95) is the
only rider to win five in a row.</TE>
<TE>   World champion sprinter Michelle Freeman was in a car accident in
Florida that killed her mother and one other person, and left Texas
women's track coach Beverly Kearney critically injured.</TE>
<TE>   According to an accident report filed by the Florida Highway
Patrol, Freeman was driving a sport utility vehicle about 35 miles
west of Jacksonville at 7:57 a.m. when the vehicle crossed the median
and swerved back, causing it to roll.</TE>
<TE>   Killed in the accident was Ilrey A. Sparks, 40, of Austin, Texas,
an academic counselor for women's athletics at Texas. Freeman's
mother, Muriel Wallace, 63, who also lived in Austin, also was
killed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an incredibly tragic day for our university," Christine
Plonsky, Texas women's athletic director, said. "We've lost one of
our finest staff members in Ilrey Sparks. Threads of her work run
through every male and female student athlete she's touched.</TE>
<TE>   "Our prayers are with everyone and with Bev Kearney," Plonsky
said. "We hope she's on her way to a full recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Freeman, 33, a former world indoor champion in the 60 meters who
also won bronze in the 400-relay for Jamaica in 1996, was at the
hospital in good condition.</TE>
<TE>   Sparks' toddler daughter, Imani, 2, was also in the vehicle and
was in fair condition.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Rangers took another step toward shoring up their
bullpen by signing right-hander Esteban Yan to a one-year deal.</TE>
<TE>   Yan, 27, went 7-8 with a 4.30 earned-run average and 18 saves in
55 games last season with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</TE>
<TE>   His signing comes four days after the Rangers signed two-time
All-Star closer Ugueth Urbina to a one-year deal for $4 million with
another $500,000 deferred.</TE>
<TE>   New Zealand's Alfa Romeo led Britain's Canon Leopard by about four
nautical miles today as the leading yachts entered Bass Strait in the
annual Sydney to Hobart race.</TE>
<TE>   All but two of the 57 entries are still in the 630-nautical-mile
race on the island state of Tasmania.</TE>
<TE>   Trumpcard and Valheru withdrew within the first hour Thursday
after collisions.</TE>
<TE>   The race record of 1 day 19 hours 48 minutes and 2 seconds set in
1999 by Danish 60-footer Nokia is not expected to be threatened
because of light winds and relatively calm seas.</TE>

<HD>Rooney's Latest Record Is Nothing to Brag About</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was an all-around bad day for Everton's Wayne Rooney. He saw not
only his two-plus month-old record for being the youngest player to
score in an English Premier League game fall, he also was shown the
first red card of his career in a 1-1 draw at St. Andrews.</LD>
<LD>   James Milner, at 16 years 357 days, scored for Leeds United in its
2-1 win at Sunderland to better the mark set by Rooney, who was 16
years 360 days when he scored against Arsenal on Oct. 19.</LD>
<LD>   For what it's worth, Rooney's ejection made him the youngest
player to be red-carded in league history.</LD>
<TE>   But this was more about infamy than fame as Rooney was ejected by
referee David Elleray for flying into a tackle with his cleats first
against Birmingham City's Steve Vickers.</TE>
<TE>   Rooney, who came into the match as a substitute for Tomasz
Radzinski, faces a three-game ban.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Supports Him</TE>
<TE>   Everton Coach David Moyes wondered if Rooney deserved the
ejection.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that at the most it should have been a yellow card,"
Moyes told Associated Press. "I think it was a strong challenge
between two players, fully committed. Steve Vickers got to the ball
slightly before Wayne and Wayne obviously caught Steve's ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to see anyone injured but I don't see it as a
sending off."</TE>
<TE>   Rooney, who has started only twice since arriving in the Premier
League this season, is considered England's next big star. His
reputation was solidified by a memorable 30-yard strike that ended
Arsenal's unbeaten streak. Rooney also has had big goals against
Leeds and Blackburn.</TE>
<TE>   But he showed a nasty streak against Liverpool in last week's
Merseyside derby.</TE>
<TE>   A near brawl after a two-footed challenge on Everton's Gary
Naysmith by Liverpool's Steven Gerrard found several Everton players,
including Rooney, rushing toward Gerrard.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe a little bit of reputation has gone before him and maybe
the referee has been looking at that," Moyes said of Rooney.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to tell him that he has to be a little bit more careful.
We have told him already this year and we will tell him again. But
you won't get me asking him to take away his aggression and maybe
that is what the referees want."</TE>
<TE>   Success Breeds Success</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy General Manager Doug Hamilton said the selection of four
L.A. players to the U.S. national team is a product of the team's
successful season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a reflection of their good performance throughout the year
and a championship season for the L.A. Galaxy," he said.Goalkeeper
Kevin Hartman, defender Danny Califf and midfielders Peter Vagenas
and Sasha Victorine were named this week to the 27-man roster. The
U.S. national team will play Canada in an international friendly Jan.
18 in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Califf and Victorine had been called up for the national team's
last match, a 2-0 win over El Salvador on Nov. 17.</TE>

<HD>Dorrell Begins Building Process</HD>
<DH>Following Bruins' bowl victory, new coach will begin work
today by putting together a staff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Karl Dorrell woke up today excited about his shiny new toy.</LD>
<LD>   But he'll have to be patient: Assembly is required.</LD>
<LD>   He arrived in Westwood on Thursday to assume control of the UCLA
football team and will get to work today, arranging the large corner
office on the second floor of the Morgan Center to his liking. His
first task is to build a staff, and he will interview several current
assistants today and Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "I want a staff of great communicators, people who are well
thought of in the profession and take to heart the relationship with
players," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The players are on vacation, enjoying the euphoria of beating New
Mexico, 27-13, Wednesday in the Las Vegas Bowl to finish a tumultuous
season a respectable 8-5. It was UCLA's first bowl victory since Jan.
1, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   All but 14 of this season's Bruins will return, so once Dorrell
turns his attention to the roster, he won't need many replacement
parts. He'll get to know players during off-season workouts that
begin in January.</TE>
<TE>   Recruits can be signed in February and spring practice is held in
April, making for a ceaseless workload.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait to get going," said Dorrell, who Sunday left his
position as Denver Bronco receivers coach.</TE>
<TE>   First-year Athletic Director Dan Guerrero fired Bob Toledo after
seven seasons in part because of off-the-field problems that began
with the handicapped parking scandal in 1999 and extended through
several fights last spring that resulted in criminal charges against
players.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell, 39, a serious-minded, even-keeled coach who stayed out of
trouble as a UCLA receiver in the 1980s, is expected to establish
strict standards of behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The only blemish is that he was on the staff of Rick Neuheisel at
Colorado and Washington when the NCAA sanctioned those schools for
recruiting violations.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero checked with the NCAA and is satisfied that Dorrell
committed no wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the right kind of character, conviction and leadership,"
Guerrero said.</TE>
<TE>   Now all Dorrell has to do is win. His base salary of $600,000 can
be boosted by incentives that begin with $15,000 for each victory
beyond seven in a season and bonuses for bowl game appearances and a
national championship.</TE>
<TE>   He also gets more cash if graduation rates exceed 70%. In a recent
study, the graduation rate of UCLA football players entering school
from the 1992-93 to the 1995-96 academic years was 61%.</TE>
<TE>   There are no incentives tied to TV appearances, attendance or the
off-the-field behavior of players.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason Guerrero made the change now is that UCLA returns a
well-stocked roster that can win immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I got to the point of making a decision, it was clear that
now is the time [to bring in a new coach] with that young team," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell inherits a roster that returns nearly every skill-position
player, three starting offensive linemen and seven defensive
starters, including two freshman All-Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Although the offense struggled in the last three games, three
players amassed more than 1,000 all-purpose yards this season --
freshman tailback/punt returner Tyler Ebell, sophomore receiver/punt
returner Craig Bragg and junior receiver/kick returner Tab Perry.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman quarterbacks Drew Olson and Matt Moore finished with
similar statistics after sharing time since senior Cory Paus was
injured in the seventh game. Olson was 53 of 104 for 707 yards and
three touchdowns with four interceptions; Moore was 33 of 62 for 412
yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Their competition for the starting job will be a highlight of
spring practice.</TE>
<TE>   Said Olson: "We both want to be the man. We'll push each other and
see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   A question on defense is the status of tackle Rodney Leisle, a
junior who is seriously contemplating leaving for the NFL. He missed
several games after having foot surgery, and Dorrell might convince
him to return.</TE>
<TE>   The new coach would be wise to remind Leisle that several Bruins
who returned for their senior season in 2001 increased their draft
status, including linebacker Robert Thomas, safety Marques Anderson,
tailback DeShaun Foster and defensive end Kenyon Coleman.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not Leisle returns, UCLA should be loaded for a
rigorous 2003 schedule that begins at Colorado, where Dorrell was
offensive coordinator for six years in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "This is his team now and he can do what he sees fit," said junior
linebacker Brandon Chillar after the Las Vegas Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all excited and a little bit anxious. We love the coaches
we have and hope some are allowed to stay. We gave them a Christmas
present with this win. It's a present for [Dorrell] too."</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell should keep it in good working order. The warranty expires
Sept. 6, the day of that opener at Colorado. From that date forward,
he is responsible for any damage.</TE>

<HD>Lewis Will Rest, Then Join Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruin Coach Steve Lavin is expecting forward Marcedes Lewis to join
the team, now that football season is over, but the freshman tight
end needs a break first.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis said after the Las Vegas Bowl that he planned to take off
until Jan. 6, which would follow UCLA's trip to Washington and
Washington State that opens Pacific 10 Conference play.</LD>
<LD>   "I need to rest my knees," said Lewis, who played both sports at
Long Beach Poly High.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, Lavin was under the impression Lewis might join the
team as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   "I think probably Monday, but I don't have an official word,"
Lavin said. "I saw him one time last week and he said soon as
possible. I don't know if that means [today] or Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He could play in spurts of two-three minutes fairly soon. But to
get into good basketball condition it takes three-four weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, who began shooting around and playing pickup games at the
Wooden Center two weeks ago, is excited to begin a new sport.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait," he said. "I can bring a little tenacity. But I
know how to play basketball. I can actually play."</TE>
<TE>   He has watched most of the games in person or on television, so he
realizes the Bruins can use the help.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't do any worse than anybody else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Dijon Thompson, the Bruins' leading scorer at 17 points a
game, did not practice because of swelling in his left knee. He said
he expected to play Saturday against Michigan.</TE>

<HD>Dupree's Return Becomes Official</HD>

<LD>On a day that USC had once hoped to use flying to Hawaii for the
Rainbow Classic, the Trojans instead returned to the North Gym for a
more than three- hour practice session that included a welcome
back-styled 'Aloha' for a teammate who had been adrift for a
semester.</LD>
<LD>   With grades being posted during the Christmas break, Jerry
Dupree's return to the team is official as the junior forward earned
a high enough grade-point average to rejoin the Trojans in time for
the start of Pacific 10 Conference play Thursday at Washington State.</LD>
<LD>   "School and basketball, you can't do one without the other,"
Dupree said Thursday night. "I learned my lesson and I won't ever get
in this predicament again and let my team and my coaches down."</LD>
<TE>   Dupree was suspended by Coach Henry Bibby in the summer for what
amounted to seven games in an effort to help him concentrate on his
studies.</TE>
<TE>   USC had tentatively scheduled the Hawaiian holiday tournament this
summer, before an Ohio judge upheld the NCAA's decree that schools
cannot play in more than two exempt events in a four-year span.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby was incredulous at talk that has UCLA boosters contacting
him to gauge his interest in coaching the Bruins should Steve Lavin
be removed.</TE>
<TE>   "How rumors start, I don't know," said Bibby, who led UCLA to
three national titles from 1970-72. "I think Steve Lavin does a good
job ... I don't know why they're all over him every year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not after his job. I have a job. I'm happy here. I like 'SC.
This is my home."</TE>

about 300 post-Christmas fox hunts. About 200,000 people turned out
to watch.</LD>
<LD>   But the centuries-old tradition is under threat as the government
moves to tighten regulation of the sport in England and Wales,
although it has shied away from an outright ban. Limited fox hunting

<HD>In China, College Costs Bring New Degree of Hardship</HD>
<DH>With the government no longer paying expenses of top
students, higher education is moving increasingly out of reach of
ordinary people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Chu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HUJIAPENG, China</DL>
<LD>Few things in her hard-bitten life have made Tang Zhenzhi as proud as
the day her son got into college.</LD>
<LD>   For a poor village boy to pass China's rigorous entrance exams
seemed to open up a rosy horizon of opportunity and financial
security for her son, Wang Daomin, and ultimately for the members of
the whole family, who could count on him to support them.</LD>
<LD>   But a calamitous thing happened on the way to Wang's diploma.
Rather than help pull the family members out of poverty, his
education hammered them deeper into it.</LD>
<TE>   Tang and her husband are mired in debt, staggering under the
weight of loans scraped together from relatives and friends to pay
their son's tuition -- a hefty expense that once would have been
covered by the state. They grab every chance to earn a little extra,
hunting or herding sheep to supplement the paltry income brought in
by their fields. Neither father nor mother has worn a stitch of new
clothing in years.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with a daughter who also made it into college and their son
in search of a job, their reward for raising two smart,
high-achieving children is near-bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "Other people go play mah-jongg or sit in teahouses, but I'm out
all day watching sheep," said Tang, 46, creasing her weathered face
into a rueful expression.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't rest a single day," she said, sighing. "When my son
first qualified for college, I saw it as a rare opportunity, an
amazing feat. But now, I'm not sure it adds up to much."</TE>
<TE>   Such a bitter reassessment flies against the accumulated wisdom of
thousands of years in China, where reverence for education as a means
of self-improvement and advancement has been passed down since the
time of Confucius.</TE>
<TE>   Generations of peasants like Tang were raised on the belief that
education offered them and their progeny a sure ticket out of the
misery and want that are endemic in China's countryside. No matter
their background, children who worked hard and proved themselves in
school could get a degree, land a good job and haul their families
several rungs up the social ladder.</TE>
<TE>   But in today's freewheeling China, ability is no longer enough.</TE>
<TE>   The Communist government, abandoning many of the egalitarian
ideals that brought it to power 53 years ago, no longer pays for all
the nation's best and brightest to attend college, and university
fees are skyrocketing. Higher education is therefore moving
increasingly out of the reach of ordinary people -- a trend that
threatens to widen the yawning divide between China's haves and
have-nots.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents such as Tang now face a cruel dilemma: to keep their
families afloat while denying their children the chance to better
themselves, or to sink into destitution beneath mounting tuition
bills.</TE>
<TE>   "When things were really bad, I considered making my kids give up
their studies. I thought I couldn't take it anymore," said another
farmer, Zhang Liangxue, 48. "I ate no meat for a year after my son
went off to college."</TE>
<TE>   In happier circumstances, the fact that both of Zhang's children
were able to win slots in college would have brought nothing but
honor to his household.</TE>
<TE>   Like Tang, Zhang lives in Hujiapeng, a rustic hamlet 100 bumpy
miles outside Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in eastern China.
The village sits among crisply wooded hillsides in a remote spot that
received telephone service only this year. A single dirt track, at
times washed out by floods, threads between simple wood and red-brick
homes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in spite of its backwater conditions, Hujiapeng shines
brightly on the academic landscape. Out of its 143 households, the
village has managed to send more than a dozen students to college in
the last four years -- an impressive record.</TE>
<TE>   Hujiapeng's Communist Party boss, an affable man in his 30s named
Wang Sheng, recounts with pride the story of a local boy who studied
hard, went off to America for more schooling, then returned to a job
in southern China that paid almost $1,000 a month, a substantial sum
by Hujiapeng's humble reckoning. That young man is now an inspiration
to the many local schoolchildren who dream of making good on behalf
of themselves and their families.</TE>
<TE>   But Wang's brow furrows as he starts ticking off the families with
children in college that have fallen on hard times, which is to say
virtually all of them.</TE>
<TE>   "Their household financial situations were pretty good before, but
now they've become poor," said Wang, who describes it as an inverse
ratio between a youth's educational level and the financial
well-being of his or her family.</TE>
<TE>   To American parents, the concept of a little belt-tightening for a
child's college education is nothing unusual.</TE>
<TE>   The situation in China, however, differs in several respects.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., students and their parents enjoy more options. If
private institutions like Stanford are too expensive, less costly but
still excellent public universities are available. Financial aid
programs can help bridge the gap, as do student loans.</TE>
<TE>   Here, young people have very little choice over where the system
puts them, if they're lucky enough even to pass China's highly
competitive entrance exams. Giving up on attending your assigned
university is almost tantamount to forgoing a college education, as
places in the schools are so tight. There is little leeway to scout
for cheaper options, and institutional mechanisms to help families
afford the fees, such as low-interest bank loans, are just getting
off the ground. Student work programs do not exist, and not everyone
can borrow from friends.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, most Chinese parents start at a much lower level of
income and living standard than the average household in the U.S. The
costs of putting a child through college therefore cut far deeper:
Meals are missed, medical care gets put off, leaky roofs go
unrepaired, leisure activities have to be abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Tang and her husband are lucky if the rice and rapeseed they plant
and the animals they tend bring in 2,000 yuan, or $240, in an entire
year. Their son graduated from a local teachers college three years
ago but is having trouble finding a steady, well-paid post in today's
saturated job market. Competition for jobs is so fierce that the
Education Ministry recently made employment for college graduates a
top priority.</TE>
<TE>   Tang's daughter is a junior, studying for a degree in art. Her
annual expenses amount to nearly 10,000 yuan, or five times the
household income -- equivalent to an American family making just
$30,000 a year yet shelling out $150,000 in annual education costs.
Tang has begged and borrowed thousands of yuan from relatives and
friends.</TE>
<TE>   "With our income now, there's no way we can repay our debts," Tang
said. "We slave away.... All we can do is ride it out."</TE>
<TE>   The Tangs' home attests to their poverty. It was built 60 to 70
years ago out of mud brick, which traps the cold now bearing down on
the region. Naked lightbulbs illuminate rooms containing the barest
minimum of furniture: a small dining table, a few rickety chairs,
beds piled with blankets to ward off the chill.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in the 1980s, better-off families in the village moved
into new red-brick homes and bought color TVs as their lives improved
with the end of collective farming in China. Tang and her husband
remain stuck where they are.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow resident Zhang was once among the most envied men in the
village. He was the first to build a two-story house, nestled against
a hillside and visible a mile away.</TE>
<TE>   "We built my home when my son was in middle school," Zhang said.
"I encouraged him to study hard ever since he was little. For rural
kids, education is a bridge. There's no other path out."</TE>
<TE>   Both his son and his daughter heeded his advice. Because of it,
Zhang is now broke.</TE>
<TE>   "In 10 years I haven't saved a single penny. Instead, I've had to
borrow more than 10,000 yuan," said Zhang, his jacket tattered, his
shoes ripped. Parents like Tang and Zhang are victims of reforms in
China's educational system that have forced colleges and universities
to raise their fees to make up for cuts in public funding. Between
1990 and 1997, tuition at institutions of higher learning rose more
than 20% every year, according to government statistics.</TE>
<TE>   On average, tuition now costs between 4,200 and 6,000 yuan a year,
easily equaling the per capita income in many of China's cities.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the overriding value of education is an article of faith for
ordinary Chinese, who grow up reciting a famous Confucian proverb:
"Only education is primary; everything else is secondary."</TE>
<TE>   Many parents will sacrifice whatever necessary to put their
children through school. They are loath to give up so coveted an
opportunity as a spot in college --not when only about 6% of Chinese
adults boast a higher degree. (In America, the figure is 26%.) China,
still impoverished and undeveloped by most standards, has only 204
universities, compared with 1,900 colleges in the U.S., which serve a
population less than a quarter the size.</TE>
<TE>   For all the scrimping, for all the added burden and toil, Tang
would not change her decision to send both her children to college.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't regret it, though life is hard now," she said. "As long
as my children have better lives than ours, that's what matters."</TE>
<TE>   But sacrifice has its limits, Tang told her daughter. "She'll have
to rely on herself if she wants to go to grad school."</TE>

<HD>Cuban-U.S. Team to Dig Into Hemingway's Past</HD>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO DE PAULA, Cuba</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO DE PAULA, Cuba -- His bearded countenance looms large
in American literature, yet even lifelong scholars of Ernest
Hemingway concede that they know little about the half of his adult
life spent in this palm-shaded Havana suburb.</LD>
<LD>   The gaps in those 21 years may soon be filled: Cubans have decided
to share with Americans a trove of writings, journals, photographs,
letters and jotted notes the author left behind.</LD>
<LD>   In a rare act of collaboration between the countries that claim
"Papa" as their own, Cuban and U.S. researchers are combing through
the 9,000 books lining the walls of the salon and study at Finca
Vigia, his home in Cuba, the land where he wrote "For Whom the Bell
Tolls" and his Pulitzer prize-winning "The Old Man and the Sea." They
are scouring the cluttered guesthouse cellar where more than 3,000
photographs and an equal number of manuscript pages and letters have
nested in boxes and file drawers for more than four decades. They are
probing and cataloging and putting together the pieces of a life on
the edge between discipline and indulgence.</LD>
<TE>   "Hemingway had an understanding of the Cuban spirit that made
people here feel close to him, that he was like us," said Carmen
Fournier, a literature professor at Havana University who will be
working with U.S. scholars researching and microfilming the
long-neglected contents of Finca Vigia.</TE>
<TE>   Fournier traces Cubans' affinity for the writer to his humble
rededication of his 1954 Nobel Prize to those who inspired his story,
describing himself as a "Cubano sato," a phrase from the Cuban
dialect meaning both flirt and half-breed.</TE>
<TE>   "Cubans wept when he said that," Fournier said.</TE>
<TE>   The cellar contents and Hemingway's massive library have been in
Cuban custody since the author left the island, and there has never
been a comprehensive, in-depth examination of the material, she said.
Fournier expects the joint work, being funded by a grant from the
Rockefeller Foundation and conducted by an array of Cuban and U.S.
Hemingway experts, to preserve the fragile memorabilia and shed light
on the subject's creative process.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like an archeological dig. You hope there will be
interesting and exciting things to discover, and you think there will
be, but you won't know exactly what unless you excavate with an open
mind," said Sandra Spanier, a Penn State University professor
recently named by the Hemingway Foundation to edit a multivolume
anthology of the author's personal correspondence. She visited the
cellar stash in March and November but only long enough to see that
the search-and-rescue project will take years.</TE>
<TE>   Few expect to discover unpublished novels or whole stories,
because Hemingway stored his writings in a bank vault that was
emptied after his death. But the snippets of everyday life being
gleaned from marginalia and his copious correspondence disclose
previously unknown details of the mercurial author. Spanier says
scholars have been surprised by Hemingway's impressive command of
Spanish, his rapt attention to household matters, even his taste in
music and the bitter repartee that marked his marriages.</TE>
<TE>   "He wrote out instructions to the servants on how to cook his
meals. He paid a lot of attention to domestic details. It really
rounds out our image of Hemingway as a rough, tough big-game hunter
and deep-sea fisherman," Spanier said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cuba of the 1940s and '50s was an ideal retreat for Hemingway,
she says, because he could find the solitude he needed to write and
the outdoor sports and carousing to which he devoted equal attention.</TE>
<TE>   At the lush Finca Vigia estate, Hemingway rose at dawn each day to
write standing up for as long as six hours. He would then abandon his
Royal typewriter to head off to the marina at Cojimar to take out his
40-foot fishing boat, the Pilar. Evenings he divided between the Old
Havana haunts of El Floridita and La Bodeguita del Medio, the former
for daiquiri binges and the latter for mojito moods.</TE>
<TE>   Hemingway's Cuban estate remains much as it was when he left in
1960 for Idaho, where he took his own life a year later. The rooms
that visitors can view from the open doors and windows look as if the
writer might just have stepped out for a moment. Books are still
piled on his desk and shelves and beside the toilet, just as he left
them. Stuffed game trophies mounted on the walls, pottery and
trinkets acquired during travels to Europe and Africa, even his old
Victrola and stash of big band albums give the appearance of a house
still lived in.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Sardinas Gonzalez, an assistant curator at the estate that
is now the Hemingway Museum and is visited by 40,000 people each
year, says Cubans expect the U.S. help in preserving the writer's
legacy to boost awareness of Finca Vigia and its potential as a
tourist destination.</TE>
<TE>   "Hemingway was a universal figure. He shouldn't be looked at as an
American because he felt himself to be part of our culture as well,"
Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the sultry villa, visitors can glimpse the pool, now
empty, where actress Ava Gardner once swam naked. They can appreciate
Hemingway's bond with pets at the poolside graves of his four dogs.
In a photo gallery set up in an auxiliary building, they can peruse
images of a 5-year-old Hemingway decked out to go fishing and the
author as master of ceremonies bestowing a fishing trophy on Fidel
Castro.</TE>
<TE>   The cellar hoard came as a surprise to most Hemingway experts. The
author's fourth wife and widow, Mary, came here a month after he
killed himself and cleaned out the bank vault where then-unpublished
manuscripts for "Islands in the Stream" and "The Garden of Eden" were
stored. She also hauled 200 pounds of documents and belongings back
to New York. But she burned the bulk of his papers, letters and
journals in a bonfire that lasted three days.</TE>
<TE>   "We really don't know what's left in the basement. What Mary
Hemingway took back with her seems almost hit or miss," said Jenny
Phillips, granddaughter of Hemingway's editor and close friend,
Maxwell Perkins, and initiator of the U.S.-Cuba collaborative
project. "We've seen only the tip of the iceberg."</TE>

<DL>NICOSIA, Cyprus</DL>
<LD>Waving flags and olive branches, about 30,000 Turkish Cypriots
marched through this divided capital Thursday to support
reunification of Cyprus -- a prerequisite for membership in the
European Union.</LD>
<LD>   The demonstrators were demanding the resignation of Rauf R.
Denktash, the leader of the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus.</LD>
<LD>   The demonstration, the largest pro-EU rally held in the
Turkish-occupied northern part of Cyprus, comes after Turkish and
Greek Cypriots failed to iron out their differences at the European
Union summit in Copenhagen this month.</LD>
<TE>   The EU invited Cyprus to join the economic bloc by 2004 and asked
both sides to find a solution by Feb. 28. If no agreement is reached,
only the Greek part of the island would enter the EU.</TE>

<HD>Iran Reportedly Ceases Its Practice of Stoning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Iran has stopped stoning as a form of capital punishment in an
apparent bid to ease European Union human rights concerns ahead of a
possible trade agreement, an Iranian newspaper reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The daily newspaper Bahar quoted Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi, a
former intelligence minister who heads the Supreme Administrative
Court, as saying that "the practice has been stopped for a while."</LD>
<LD>   The newspaper also cited a reformist lawmaker as saying that the
head of the judiciary had instructed judges to stop ordering death by
stoning. Judiciary officials were not immediately available to
comment.</LD>
<TE>   Under Iran's strict Islamic law, men and women convicted of
adultery are normally sentenced to death by stoning. The condemned
are partly buried in a pit and then pelted with stones. According to
the law, the stones must be big enough to injure but not kill with
just a few blows. If the victims dig themselves out, they are
acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in the Islamic Republic refuse to say how often stonings
are carried out, but at least two women were reported to have been
stoned to death last year.</TE>
<TE>   Although stonings are rare, execution by hanging is common for
murder, rape, drug smuggling and armed robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union and Iran began negotiations on a trade
agreement this month, but the EU has insisted that Iran take steps to
improve its human rights record.</TE>

<HD>Iraq to Give U.N. a List of Weapons Scientists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraq will hand over to the United Nations in the next few days a list
of hundreds of Iraqi scientists who have worked on nuclear, chemical,
biological and missile programs, a senior Iraqi general said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the toughened U.N. inspections that resumed Nov. 27,
inspectors can speak privately with scientists and workers associated
with Iraq's weapons -- and even take them abroad for interviews. U.S.
officials have said they hope the privacy would prompt scientists to
reveal hidden weapons programs.</LD>
<LD>   Chief inspector Hans Blix had requested that Baghdad provide a
list of scientists by month's end, and Iraq had said it would comply.</LD>
<TE>   "The list will be ready within two to three days, and it will be
sent to the U.N. Security Council at most by Sunday," Gen. Hussam
Mohammed Amin, head of Iraq's National Monitoring Directorate, told a
news conference in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Although weapons inspectors have spoken to engineers and experts
at the sites they have searched, their first request to interview a
scientist privately was made only Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   University of Technology professor Sabah Abdul Nour, who had
worked on a nuclear program that Iraq says is closed, insisted on the
presence of Iraqi officials, Amin said. He said the inspectors have
not asked to interview other scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Amin said the U.N. inspectors have searched 188 sites since they
began their mission a month ago. On Thursday, they returned to the
University of Technology, checking equipment at the chemistry,
engineering and computer departments that had been tagged during U.N.
inspections years ago.</TE>

<HD>Allegations of Fraud Precede Kenyan Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>Kenyans were voting today in landmark elections that signal the end
of almost a quarter-century of rule by President Daniel Arap Moi,
with pundits predicting an unprecedented opposition victory.</LD>
<LD>   Candidates crisscrossed Kenya on Thursday in a final bid for
support. The polls were to remain open for 12 hours today, but that
period could be extended in case transportation is hampered by bad
weather -- a distinct possibility after heavy rain in central Kenya.
.</LD>
<LD>   Despite Christmas Day appeals by clergy for peaceful voting, there
was some preelection violence in the capital, Nairobi, and
allegations of fraud surfaced.</LD>
<TE>   The opposition National Rainbow Coalition, whose leader, Mwai
Kibaki, is widely favored to win the presidency, said three
supporters had been killed by police firing on a bus in Nairobi's
opposition bastion of Westlands on Wednesday night. Police confirmed
two deaths but disputed the circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition also stepped up accusations that Moi's camp planned
to usher in his preferred successor, Uhuru Kenyatta, by unfair means.</TE>
<TE>   Electoral Commission spokesman Mani Lemayian said the panel was
investigating reports that a plane carrying ballots pre-marked in
favor of Internal Security Minister Julius Sunkuli had been found in
the parliamentary constituency he is defending for Moi's Kenya
African National Union, or KANU.</TE>
<TE>   Sunkuli could not be reached immediately for comment, and KANU
Director of Elections William Ruto issued a blanket denial of any
ballot fraud or wrongdoing by his party.</TE>
<TE>   Most attention focuses on the powerful executive presidency, held
by KANU since independence from Britain in 1963 and run with an iron
fist by Moi since 1978. Parliament is relatively toothless by
comparison.</TE>
<TE>   Kibaki, at 71 only seven years younger than Moi, hopes to
capitalize on a hunger for change after years of economic stagnation
and corruption under KANU.</TE>
<TE>   "I know from the reports we are getting that we are together, and
I believe we will win," Kibaki told supporters as he left his Nairobi
home in a convoy of about 50 cars headed for his constituency of
Othaya in Central province.</TE>
<TE>   Kibaki served Moi as vice president and senior Cabinet minister
for more than a decade. Moi is prevented by law from running again.</TE>
<TE>   "I step down happy, having completed my two terms of the
multiparty democracy," Moi said as he cast his ballot near his
birthplace in the Baringo area of the Rift Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to wish well the one who I am going to hand over to. And I
hope the people will respect the verdict and the voice of the
people."</TE>
<TE>   Moi will officially step down at the inauguration of his
successor, expected in the first few days of January.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Raids in West Bank Leave 7 Dead</HD>
<DH>The army says it went after militants to thwart attacks.
Two other Palestinians are found dead after a reported bid to
infiltrate settlements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>In what Israel described as an intensive manhunt for Palestinian
militants, its troops raided homes, marketplaces and a hospital
across the West Bank on Thursday, killing at least seven
Palestinians, including two men who it said were local leaders of the
radical groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians said at least two of the dead were bystanders -- a
young policeman directing traffic in a square, and a teenager with
schoolbooks who walked into a clash between soldiers and Palestinian
stone-throwers.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the bodies of two other Palestinians, both men, were
found early Thursday after what Israel said had been an overnight
attempt to infiltrate Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. The toll made it one of the deadliest 24-hour periods in
weeks.</LD>
<TE>   The wide-ranging Israeli campaign to seize or kill wanted
Palestinians drew vows of vengeance from Palestinian militant groups,
which haven't staged a major attack inside Israel in four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The latest confrontations also came against the backdrop of
Israel's national election campaign, with balloting only a little
more than a month away, and at a time when the Bush administration
has made it plain that it hopes Israel won't take actions likely to
inflame passions in the Arab world in the run-up to a possible war
with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his right-wing Likud Party say
that regardless of external circumstances, Palestinian attacks will
be met with an unrelenting show of force. "We intend to stop terror
wherever we find it," Raanan Gissin, a Sharon aide, said when asked
about Thursday's actions by the army.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's opponent, Amram Mitzna of the left-leaning Labor Party,
advocates taking steps to promote a climate in which peace talks
could be restarted, including a unilateral pullout of troops and
settlers from the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   On the ground, however, there was little sign that the bitter
stalemate could be broken any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, Israeli troops used tear gas
and stun grenades to enforce a tight military curfew, driving
Palestinians off the streets and back into their homes. The soldiers
had pulled back from the center of town Tuesday to allow for
Christmas festivities by local people and the thin smattering of
foreign pilgrims and tourists who had made their way to the town,
where tradition says Jesus was born, to mark the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   By nightfall, the rain-soaked cobblestone streets were silent and
empty except for the occasional Israeli military patrol.</TE>
<TE>   The army called the day's operations, carried out in half a dozen
West Bank cities and towns, part of a continuing drive to arrest
Palestinian militants before they have the chance to carry out
suicide bombings or other attacks against Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   It said its troops were acting on intelligence pointing to a
specific threat posed by the men they swooped down to arrest.
Palestinians, however, said that in several cases, the wanted men
were killed without an opportunity to surrender.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the deaths, five Israeli soldiers and about 20
Palestinians were wounded in the various clashes in the cities of
Ramallah, Tulkarm and Nablus and the village of Kabatiya. In what has
become a pattern in recent months, many of the daylight raids took
place in crowded urban areas, creating panic among ordinary
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "I was tear-gassed twice," said Dina Jibril, a Palestinian
secretary who lives in the village of Beitunia, outside Ramallah. She
was on her way home from work Thursday afternoon when troops and
armored vehicles arrived in what the army said was hot pursuit of
fugitive militants.</TE>
<TE>   In one raid, soldiers entered the compound of Ramallah's main
hospital, and a gunfight ensued. Palestinians said a wanted man named
Samir Shamali, who lived on the edge of town, was shot and killed.</TE>
<TE>   Another exchange of fire took place in one of Ramallah's busiest
plazas, a downtown traffic circle called Manara Square, where Israeli
troops stopped a car carrying two wanted Hamas activists. One of them
was killed when the gunfight broke out, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   The commotion drew a crowd of stone-throwers, and troops fired
toward them, killing a traffic policeman, according to Palestinian
witnesses. The army said it recovered cash and weapons in the Hamas
men's car.</TE>
<TE>   Israel also said it killed a senior local leader of Islamic Jihad
in Kabatiya, outside Jenin. Palestinian witnesses said soldiers
surrounded the house of Hamza abu Roub and demanded that he
surrender. Abu Roub sent out his wife and children but then opened
fire, wounding four soldiers, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   He was killed in a massive barrage of return fire. Afterward,
soldiers blew up his home -- a tactic increasingly used in recent
months. Israel considers it a deterrent to militants; Palestinians
and human rights groups say it punishes families that are often
innocent of complicity.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic Jihad, in a statement issued in the Gaza Strip, promised
to "avenge this crime."</TE>
<TE>   Also tracked to his home and killed by troops was Jamal Nader
Yahiyeh, described by Israel as a leader of the Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade in Tulkarm.</TE>
<TE>   Another Palestinian gunman was reported killed in Nablus, in an
exchange of gunfire that spilled over into the streets of the casbah,
or old city. Hospital officials said one passerby was killed and at
least a dozen people were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said an 18-year-old Palestinian who was not involved in
the confrontation was shot and killed when he walked into the line of
fire.</TE>

<HD>N. Korea Actions Draw Rebuke</HD>
<DH>U.N. watchdog and Seoul decry Pyongyang's 'nuclear
brinkmanship.' Two U.S. senators urge Bush to hold talks with the
communist regime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alissa J. Rubin and Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>The U.N. nuclear watchdog agency and South Korea's outgoing president
Thursday criticized North Korea's moves to restart its nuclear arms
program, accusing the communist regime of engaging in "nuclear
brinkmanship" and of "aggravating" an international standoff.</LD>
<LD>   The criticisms came as two influential U.S. senators urged the
Bush administration to begin talks with North Korea, a step the White
House has insisted it will not take until the government in Pyongyang
abandons efforts to build nuclear weapons.</LD>
<LD>   In Vienna, Mohammed Baradei, director of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, or IAEA, warned that North Korea "has no current
legitimate peaceful use for plutonium.</LD>
<TE>   "Restarting its nuclear facilities without appropriate safeguards,
and toward producing plutonium, raises serious nonproliferation
concerns and is tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Seoul, President Kim Dae Jung, in some of his harshest comments
in weeks, told a special Cabinet meeting Thursday that South Korea
"can never go along with North Korea's nuclear weapons development."</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the international community's efforts for a peaceful
resolution of the nuclear issue, North Korea moved to restart frozen
nuclear facilities, further aggravating the situation," the South
Korean president said.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, whose term ends in February, was the architect of a new
policy of engagement that led to a historic summit between the North
and South in June 2000. Fearful that South Korea would be caught in
the middle of any confrontation between the U.S. and North Korea, he
wants his country to take the initiative to stem the dangerous
downward spiral of relations.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not be pushed aside," he reportedly told the Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   An aide to South Korean President-elect Roh Moo Hyun said Thursday
that Roh will send a special envoy to Pyongyang, the North's capital,
in January to try to open a dialogue. The trip would most likely
follow an anticipated visit to Seoul in the new year by Assistant
Secretary of State James A. Kelly, another aide to Roh said, speaking
on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Roh released a statement criticizing the North today and said its
recent actions could make it difficult for him to continue the
South's reconciliation policy. "Whatever North Korea's rationale is
in taking such actions, they are not beneficial to peace and
stability on the Korean peninsula and in Northeast Asia, nor are they
helpful for its own safety," Roh said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as condemnations of its actions continued, North Korea moved
1,000 fresh fuel rods into a 5-megawatt research reactor at its
Yongbyon nuclear complex, the IAEA reported. The move was seen as
another step toward resuming the nuclear program that the North
officially halted in 1994 under an international agreement.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has made several moves toward restarting its nuclear
complex since last weekend, when it began shutting down U.N.
surveillance cameras and unsealing locks that have been in place for
eight years.</TE>
<TE>   IAEA officials said that Thursday's move is significant, although
the reactor is not yet in working order and is expected to need one
to two months of repair before becoming operable. The reactor, which
produces plutonium as a byproduct, requires 8,000 rods to operate.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the fresh fuel rods is a far less dangerous step than if
the North Koreans had begun work on another installation at the same
complex, a nuclear-fuel reprocessing lab, which can extract plutonium
from spent fuel. There are 8,000 spent fuel rods at the site. U.S.
officials say they believe the North Koreans could build new nuclear
weapons by the second half of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   IAEA inspectors remain at the complex and have not yet been asked
to leave, according to the agency's Vienna headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have been talking with other countries in the
region about the brewing crisis, but the Bush administration has
insisted that it doesn't intend to resume talks with the North
Koreans until Pyongyang signals a willingness to honor its
commitments not to resume a nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   A State Department official reaffirmed that view Thursday. "We're
not going to reward bad behavior and violation of previous
commitments they have made," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, continuing a round of what
have become almost daily conversations with foreign governments about
the Korean peninsula, telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Igor S.
Ivanov on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Expressing concern, two senators urged the administration Thursday
to intensify efforts to end the diplomatic standoff.</TE>
<TE>   "Our strategy now has to be one of multilateral engagement," Sen.
Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said in an interview on NBC's "Today" show.</TE>
<TE>   He and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), the current chairman of
the committee, urged the administration to begin such an effort with
South Korea, Japan, Russia and other Asian powers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, North Korea issued its most conciliatory statement yet
about the maneuvers. "Our measure has nothing to do with plans to
develop nuclear weapons," said a commentary on Radio Pyongyang. "Our
republic constantly maintains an anti-nuclear, peace-loving
position."</TE>
<TE>   South Korean officials said they believe that North Korea's goal
is to prove to the world that it should be taken seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole purpose of the gestures they have made recently ... are
to prove ... that they are following up with demonstrable action,"
said Chun Yung Woo, a senior South Korean Foreign Ministry official.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans' larger goal is to restart negotiations with the
United States, he said. The United States and key regional allies
stopped delivery of oil to North Korea in October after the Stalinist
country admitted that it had a secret uranium-enrichment program.
Uranium, like plutonium, is used in nuclear bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The United States had agreed to deliver oil to North Korea as part
of the 1994 so-called framework agreement, under which North Korea
eschewed a nuclear weapons program in exchange for energy assistance.</TE>

<HD>12 Philippine Employees of Canadian Firm Killed</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MANILA</DL>
<LD>Suspected Muslim rebels ambushed local workers of a Canadian company
Thursday in the southern Philippines, killing 12 and injuring 10, the
military said.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second deadly attack on Mindanao island this week. On
Christmas Eve, a bomb exploded outside a mayor's home, killing 17
people.</LD>
<LD>   It was not clear whether there was a link between the incidents,
which occurred about 100 miles apart.</LD>
<TE>   The military blamed the attacks on rebels from the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front. Rebel spokesman Eid Kabalu denied any involvement.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's attack, dozens of employees, who were Filipino, were
ambushed by gunmen in Zamboanga del Norte province.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the MILF had been extorting money from the workers'
employer, the Calgary-based mining firm Toronto Ventures Inc.
Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic charity Caritas-Philippines says the company
has been harassing tribal people opposed to mining operations on
their ancestral lands, where many of their dead are buried.</TE>
<TE>   The impoverished southern Philippines is home to Muslim guerrillas
fighting for self-rule in this predominantly Christian nation. But
the area is also populated by Muslim tribes armed with unlicensed
weapons, and clan fighting and personal conflicts abound.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials could not be immediately reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Chavez's Opponents Take Tougher Line</HD>
<DH>Venezuelans demand that state oil workers on strike be
allowed to keep their jobs after crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>The opposition hardened its stance against Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez by demanding Thursday that striking state oil employees keep
their jobs as part of any accord to end the crisis in the world's No.
5 petroleum exporter.</LD>
<LD>   Waving banners and national flags, thousands of demonstrators took
to the streets in different parts of the capital, Caracas, in support
of demands that Chavez quit and call immediate elections.</LD>
<LD>   But government officials, who have vowed to defeat the 25-day-old
strike and oust dissidents from state oil firm Petroleos de
Venezuela, or PDVSA, swiftly rejected the new opposition demands.</LD>
<TE>   "We cannot deal with delinquents," Labor Minister Maria Cristina
Iglesias said. "In what country in the world would those who attack
the nation's economic backbone be allowed to continue on there?"</TE>
<TE>   The opposition shutdown has rocked global markets as the strikers
choked off the nation's vital oil production and hobbled petroleum
exports.</TE>
<TE>   Striking executives and managers at PDVSA on Thursday voted to
keep up the stoppage until Chavez steps down, helping to drive New
York oil futures up as high as $32.55 a barrel, the highest level
since January 2001. Venezuela supplies more than 10% of U.S. oil
imports.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, who was elected in 1998 and survived a coup in April, has
dismissed demands for an early vote. His foes accuse Chavez of
driving the economy into a sharp contraction and say his fiery
populist rhetoric has fueled class hatred.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition's tougher stance will complicate efforts by
international mediators to break the deadlock, because the president
already has fired dozens of PDVSA executives.</TE>
<TE>   Many Venezuelans lined up for hours at gasoline stations as they
hunted for dwindling fuel supplies. Banks remain partly closed, and
many other businesses have remained shuttered in support of the
protest.</TE>
<TE>   But commerce is bustling in the center of the capital and poorer
areas, where support for the president is firmer.</TE>
<TE>   The government is negotiating with the Dominican Republic to
exchange oil for food imports as supplies of some basic goods have
been hit by the strike, local media reported.</TE>
<TE>   Talks between the government and opposition, brokered by the
Organization of American States, have had no success.</TE>

<HD>In Afghanistan, Guns Hold Sway Over Law</HD>
<DH>Despite a pro-Western government in place of the Taliban,
warlords and their minions continue to control much of the country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Kraul</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEYAGERD, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Obaidullah is watching his farm near this village in northern
Afghanistan slowly wither and die. His orchard, which once numbered
350 trees, is down to 10. His fields, once filled with wheat and
barley, are parched.</LD>
<LD>   For years, the 46-year-old had survived even through patches of
drought thanks to a centuries-old irrigation system based on sharing
and community management. But he's been left high and dry by armed
thugs up-canal, who have hijacked his water for their own cotton and
rice crops.</LD>
<LD>   There is no government agency or aid organization strong enough to
intercede, and Obaidullah has no weapons and, in any case, no stomach
for a fight.</LD>
<TE>   "The problem isn't people, it's guns," Obaidullah said of the
neighbors who have blocked his access to water near this village 15
miles north of Mazar-i-Sharif. "If all the guns disappeared, we could
go back to the old system. But as the situation stands, people are
afraid even to talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   A new pro-Western government led by President Hamid Karzai has
replaced the Taliban regime that was ousted more than a year ago, but
much of the country remains a lawless place where "anyone with a gun
is the government," as one youth here put it.</TE>
<TE>   Impoverished farmers such as Obaidullah aren't the only victims:
His plight is just one example of how guns and the warlords who wield
them are distorting the Afghan economy, obstructing the role of
government and impeding the delivery of relief and reconstruction
aid.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 20 years, guns poured into the country as
foreign-backed rebel groups fought the Soviet occupation and then the
Taliban. Now, those militias find themselves as the de facto
government outside the capital, Kabul, answerable only to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and other nations are training a new Afghan army and
police force, but they are at least two years from effective
deployment. So the Karzai government has little means of injecting
itself into disputes like Obaidullah's. And the international
community has refused so far to deploy peacekeepers outside Kabul who
might help the central government take control.</TE>
<TE>   Filling the vacuum are warlords and thousands of their armed
minions. Their primacy over civil authority and the rule of law has
myriad implications here.</TE>
<TE>   Ministers in the Karzai administration are increasingly frustrated
that warlords are collecting tens of millions of dollars in taxes and
import duties at the country's principal ports of entry, money the
government desperately needs to finance its budget. The Afghan
government estimates that the warlords' take this year ran as high as
$300 million.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Mohammed Amin Farhang, the minister of
reconstruction, said the government is powerless even to collect
customs duties on imported air freight arriving at Kabul's airport or
on goods entering the capital by land at the main truck depot,
because militiamen control those key locations.</TE>
<TE>   "A central government that cannot get the country's income itself
cannot be called a complete government and will not have its national
sovereignty," Farhang said.</TE>
<TE>   In northern Afghanistan, the situation is particularly acute. The
region's principal border crossings are controlled by three powerful
warlords: Atta Mohammed, Abdul Rashid Dostum and Mohammed Sardar
Sayedi.</TE>
<TE>   All are former militia leaders who helped oust the Taliban but who
still lead armed troops divided mainly along ethnic lines. Each has
been given an official military title by Karzai, and Dostum is the
president's representative in the north.</TE>
<TE>   But it is clear that the three are more responsive to their
group's interests than those of the nation at large. Finance Minister
Ashref Ghani in July demanded that the warlords pass customs revenue
on to the central government, but only Ismail Khan, governor of the
western province of Herat, has complied, sending $5 million so far.</TE>
<TE>   Warlord Mohammed said in an interview that his militia will share
the revenue he collects with the government after it shows what it
can do for the northern provinces.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, the central government is entitled to collect the
revenue as long as they consider our needs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, major relief organizations in the north say warlords
interfere with their efforts to work with civil authorities to
deliver aid, by setting agendas and demanding percentages of
supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "Who do you deal with? Self-motivated individuals looking to
increase their power base, or legitimate [but powerless] civil
authorities there to serve the needs of the people?" asked one
exasperated relief official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Another relief official cited a recent gathering of major
humanitarian agencies in Mazar-i-Sharif called by the provincial
governor to set priorities for the coming year. Participants were
surprised to find the meeting directed by Mohammed, who spoke for an
hour, ticking off a list of projects he wanted funded.</TE>
<TE>   Ongoing threats and sporadic violence also have taken a toll on
aid groups here. In June, a convoy of vehicles belonging to the
French nongovernmental agency ACTED was stopped by militiamen and
robbed of its cash and computers, and a female member of the group
was raped.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the attack was random violence or a political act designed
to let agencies know who is boss in the north is open to debate. But
female Afghan relief workers have received warnings not to
participate in programs boosting women's rights and education, relief
workers here say.</TE>
<TE>   In October, U.S. Ambassador Robert Finn said he froze funding for
new projects around Mazar-i-Sharif through the U.S. Agency for
International Development after clashes among local militias killed
six Afghans. The freeze remains in effect.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not be able to institute any more programs of assistance
in the Mazar-i-Sharif area because of the continuing inability of
leaders in the area to provide a security situation that we felt we
could say to U.S. citizens, 'Yes, you can go and work there,' " Finn
said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Multinational groups including the United Nations are pushing a
voluntary disarmament program in the north that so far has netted
1,600 weapons, a program to which Mohammed and Dostum have given
limited support. Although their troops are not about to disarm
totally, both have intervened at a few collection points to order
their subjects to give up their weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Praising such actions, one Western diplomat said the three
northern warlords are trying to ease tensions, going so far as to say
that they had carved out an "island of tranquillity" when compared
with other parts of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Minister of Telecommunications Mohammed Masoom
Stanekzai attended a ceremony with Atta Mohammed inaugurating an
Internet facility in Mazar-i-Sharif. Stanekzai praised the warlord's
growing civic involvement.</TE>
<TE>   But Farhang is less sanguine. He believes that the U.S.-led
coalition that helped the militias oust the Taliban may have to get
involved in disarming them, "putting the genie back in the bottle."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, fear remains palpable in the countryside, where farmers
such as Obaidullah don't dare to confront the water thieves, fearing
a bullet will be their reward.</TE>
<TE>   For centuries, water disputes were settled by arbiters called
meerhabs, who were elected by farmers along the 50-mile-long canal
system.</TE>
<TE>   Now those judges are afraid to act -- and for good reason. One
area farmer was killed over a water dispute this month.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't feel secure enough to work on any kind of peaceful
plan to work the problem out," said Obaidullah, who is not sure to
which warlord the men who stole his water answer. "They know it will
just fall by the wayside."</TE>

<HD>Burden of Beasts in China</HD>
<DH>Many captive animals face starvation, overwork, abuse and
death. When private zoos fail, the results can be devastating.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>YULIN, China</DL>
<LD>The brown bear used to weigh as much as 900 pounds. He could easily
chomp down 40 pounds of meat a day. Not anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Since business at the private Yulin Zoo soured a few years ago,
the omnivore is lucky to see any kind of food. Once a day, his keeper
scrapes together leftover lunches from a nearby children's martial
arts school. When that's not available, all the bear gets is porridge
or cornmeal soup.</LD>
<LD>   He has lost nearly half his body fat. He growls and pounces on any
prospect of food that the occasional visitor tosses into his damp
concrete cage -- a dry sunflower seed, a raw olive.</LD>
<TE>   "We feed him whatever we can get, just like a pig," said zoo
manager Yang Yisheng.</TE>
<TE>   Much has been made of China's record on human rights. But less
publicized is the country's dismal performance on animal rights. As
the communist nation reaps the financial benefits of capitalist
economic reforms, captive animals have become victims of the mad dash
to get rich quick.</TE>
<TE>   From the proliferation of poorly managed private zoos to the
horrors of legal bear-bile "farming," entrepreneurs have reduced
precious wildlife to disposable sources of cash. Without adequate
animal welfare legislation and more public awareness, it's likely
more animals will be starved or worked to death.</TE>
<TE>   "The big problem in China is there are no general animal
protection laws like we have in the West," said Victor Watkins,
director of wildlife at the London-based World Society for the
Protection of Animals. "There seems to be no regulation of the zoos,
no real awareness and no concern for the welfare of animals."</TE>
<TE>   That's not entirely true. China does have a law that forbids the
poaching and hunting of endangered species. But it has no legislation
to prevent cruelty and abuse against animals, including those that
may be endangered.</TE>
<TE>   Even if government officials want to help, they say their hands
are tied.</TE>
<TE>   "If you tell me animals are starving, I can't do anything about
it," said Liu Song, an official responsible for zoos with the State
Forestry Administration in Beijing, which is charged with managing
wildlife. "There is no law that says we have to do anything about
it."</TE>
<TE>   Under China's government-controlled economy, the state offered
cradle-to-grave welfare for captive wildlife, as it did for humans.
There were only a handful of large zoos around the country. The
animals' well-being was relatively easy to guarantee. But that was
before the anything-goes market reforms swept the country two decades
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Large national zoos in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai
still command government funding and attention, but a growing number
of private zoos do not. According to the Chinese Zoo Assn., at least
200 animal parks nationwide are cashing in on rising incomes and
hearty appetites for family entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Motivated more by profit than the protection and preservation of
wildlife, the safari parks and zoos are easy to open but difficult to
monitor. Many poach or smuggle in endangered species, often killing
or injuring the beasts in the process.</TE>
<TE>   The park operators tend to underestimate the high cost of
maintaining large animals and overestimate visitor attendance. Most
have little management experience or veterinary training.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, two agencies -- the Forestry Administration and the
Construction Ministry -- share responsibility related to animals and
parks. The overlap creates loopholes that make oversight difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in the West, China lacks private foundations or nonprofit
organizations capable of lending a helping hand. Much like ailing
state-owned enterprises that spit out redundant workers, bankrupt
zoos end up forcing wild animals to fend for themselves or perish.</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago, wolves from a financially strapped zoo in the
coastal city of Ningbo in eastern China escaped by chewing a hole in
their rusted metal fence. According to one zookeeper, the animals had
been starving. The wolves' small meat ration often was stolen by
staff members to feed their own families.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, four wolves were caught, shot, poisoned or beaten to
death. Zoo officials said they couldn't afford tranquilizer guns
needed to capture the beasts.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, aquarium operators in the central Chinese city of Chengdu
fell behind on utility bills. The landlord shut off the power supply.
At least 10 varieties of endangered marine species froze to death.</TE>
<TE>   A private aquarium in Wenzhou on the eastern coast was in similar
straits. Operators couldn't afford central heating so they placed an
exposed furnace on the steps of the indoor pool. An alligator came
too close and is still recovering from burns on its tail.</TE>
<TE>   "We made $150,000 in our first year," said a manager, who gave
only his surname, Chen. "We were the pride of Wenzhou. But now we
can't even afford electricity. The government won't bail us out."</TE>
<TE>   Desperate zoo operators resort to sideshows and other gimmicks to
keep the audiences coming. The lively Chinese media frequently offer
tales of exotic animals, such as peacocks and tigers, forced to
perform until they die from exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   Even more miserable are the Asiatic black bears, who are captured
for their valuable internal fluids. As many as 7,000 of these
endangered animals are believed to be held in government-sanctioned
"farms," where they live most of their lives in cages too small for
them to stand up or turn around.</TE>
<TE>   Workers, most of them lacking medical training, cut open the
bears' abdomens to insert tubes that allow the animals to be "milked"
of bile twice a day. The fluid is used in products ranging from
health tonics to shampoo. The process is so painful that bears often
bang their heads against the tiny cage.</TE>
<TE>   "Chinese people tend to regard animals as a form of natural
resource, not living beings capable of feeling pain," Zhang Li,
acting director for China of the Massachusetts-based International
Fund for Animal Welfare, said from his office in Beijing. "This is
definitely bad for China's reputation."</TE>
<TE>   But Liang Feng didn't expect that his animals would suffer when he
opened the nation's first private zoo in 1994. The former private
school administrator said that he had planned to start a learning
center in Yulin but that the local government asked him to invest in
a zoo instead to boost tourism.</TE>
<TE>   It was fine when business thrived. During its first Chinese New
Year's Day, the Yulin Zoo brought in as much as $18,000 in ticket
sales, a fortune for this small city in southern China's impoverished
Guangxi province.</TE>
<TE>   "We had about 30,000 visitors that day," Liang recalled. "There
was a traffic jam on the road here, and we didn't have enough ticket
stubs for all the people that came."</TE>
<TE>   At the zoo's prime, Liang housed more than 1,000 exotic animals,
including monkeys, camels, birds and fish, even tigers, lions and an
elephant. But tourism in the area never took off. As the initial
burst of visitors trailed off, so did the cash flow.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the government would help us out," Liang said. "I
brought the first zoo to our area. I was making history."</TE>
<TE>   Seeing no subsidy from the state, the zoo dropped the admission
price by 40%. It didn't make much difference.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate for visitors to the zoo, the staff began staging the
feeding of trembling farm animals to carnivores. "We threw in live
cows, sheep, horses, just to see how the tiger would react," Liang
said.</TE>
<TE>   When that was not enough, they shoved the larger beasts together
into one arena.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't talk about this, but we were forced to make the
tiger and the lion fight, just so we could make money," Liang said.
"They were so ferocious, we had to pry them apart with a log."</TE>
<TE>   Even that didn't improve attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Facing the threat of mass starvation among the animals, he
returned some of them to the zoos from which they had been purchased.
Many others embarked on a Dickensian life of toiling and sweat.</TE>
<TE>   A 16-year-old tiger landed in a traveling animal show. The animal
was so underfed and overworked by the new keepers that it was
emaciated when it died, Liang said. Its remains immediately
disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for these beasts, they often are worth more dead
than alive. It is both illegal and difficult to hunt and sell
wildlife. Only zoos can trade animals, offering small symbolic
amounts for the exchange. But animal parts smuggled and sold on the
black market can fetch high prices.</TE>
<TE>   Since little accountability is required after an animal dies in
captivity, some zoos secretly welcome the demise of a beast from an
endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   A zoo in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen reportedly ran a
thriving underground business marinating dead tiger bones in its
basement and selling them to visitors as snacks.</TE>
<TE>   In the West, zoos can be sued for animal cruelty, but in China it
is difficult to turn to the courts for legal remedy.</TE>
<TE>   A controversial case this spring involved a college student who
attacked five bears at the Beijing Zoo with sulfuric acid. One animal
was blinded, and the others suffered severe burns. The attack
prompted public outcries. But university officials, who normally are
willing to expel students for such things as pregnancy, imposed a
lesser form of punishment. Nor was it possible to press criminal
charges against the offender because no law had been violated.</TE>
<TE>   "Without new animal rights legislation we have very limited power
to protest," said Mang Ping, an animal rights activist in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   A controversy erupted this fall when a Beijing safari park donated
more than a dozen animals to replenish the war-ravaged Kabul Zoo.
International zoo communities protested the move, arguing that the
Afghan facility was in no condition to care for the beasts.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows their total ignorance," said Watkins, of the World
Society for the Protection of Animals, referring to the Chinese
action. "It's a disgrace."</TE>
<TE>   But as China's stature rises in the world and the country prepares
to host the 2008 Olympics and the 2010 World Exposition, advocates
see an opportunity to draw attention to the plight of the nation's
animals.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics is China's pride. I'm afraid bear-bile farming is
its shame," said Jill Robinson, founder of Hong Kong-based Animals
Asia Foundation, which runs a bear rescue program in China.</TE>
<TE>   But can the animals wait that long?</TE>
<TE>   At the Yulin Zoo, the remaining four bears and three monkeys cling
to life with no improvement in sight. There's no money to hire a vet.</TE>
<TE>   One of the starving bears tried to run away and was stuffed into
an even smaller cage. To prevent the monkeys from trying to flee,
zookeepers hung heavy metal chains around their necks.</TE>
<TE>   During the zoo's decline, the staff watched a father bear clobber
a newborn cub to death. The mother bear's name is Lian, which means
either lotus or pity.</TE>
<TE>   "She really is a pity now," Liang said recently, trekking up the
ruins of his former empire, passing empty cages, overgrown weeds and
a dry fish tank. A giant sea turtle that cost Liang more than $1,200
had scraped its belly on the bottom of the shallow pool and died of
infection.</TE>
<TE>   "It weighed more than 150 pounds. That's as big as a grown man,"
Liang said. "We stir-fried its liver. It filled three large plates."</TE>

<KH>HERB RITTS: 1952-2002</KH>
<HD>Stylish Images Made Photographer a Star in His Own Right</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Herb Ritts, the internationally acclaimed photographer known for his
scintillating portraits of superstars and his glossy high-fashion
spreads, died Thursday of complications of pneumonia while
hospitalized at UCLA Medical Center, said his publicist, Stephen
Huvane. Ritts was 50.</LD>
<LD>   His images of Tina Turner, Tom Cruise, kd lang, the Dalai Lama and
every supermodel worthy of the title helped define the
image-conscious 1980s and '90s.</LD>
<LD>   Designers Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani sought
Ritts' photography, which has a style void of the outlandish staging
of contemporary David LaChapelle or the edginess of Annie Leibovitz.
The results were iconographic -- and became cover fodder for such top
fashion and culture magazines as Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone,
Interview, GQ, Harper's Bazaar and Vogue.</LD>
<TE>   "Herb was not only our key photographer, he was incredibly
generous," said Vogue Editor Anna Wintour early Thursday evening.
"Unlike others in our field, he was the opposite of a prima donna. He
made people feel welcome."</TE>
<TE>   A native Angeleno, Ritts became as big a star as many of the
personalities he captured on film: Madonna grabbing her crotch,
Monica Lewinsky romping on the beach, Cindy Crawford cross-dressing
and Elizabeth Taylor showing off the brain surgery scar on her nearly
shaved head.</TE>
<TE>   Vogue's design director, Charles Churchward, worked with Ritts for
20 years and considered him a close friend. The two worked together
last month on a photo spread for the magazine featuring United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his wife for an upcoming
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Churchward said the shoot had been difficult to set up because of
tight security and complicated negotiations. The Annans had just
arrived from Europe. "Within moments, it was like they were old
friends," Churchward said.</TE>
<TE>   Later that evening, Ritts sent wine to the restaurant table where
the Annans were having dinner. "That was the way it usually was on
shoots; it didn't matter who the person was.... Everybody felt
comfortable. That was his secret. That's why people always trusted
him so much."</TE>
<TE>   David Fahey, a Los Angeles photography art dealer and Ritts'
exclusive gallery representative, said Ritts was stylistically
unique, a photographer who created unglamorized portraits of
glamorous people. "He had a very key ability in observing human
beings, finding a characteristic unique to them and making it
beautiful: Sandra Bernhard and her mouth, Jean-Paul Gaultier's hair,
Elizabeth Taylor's scar. He would grasp the subject's essence," Fahey
said. "He would create the atmosphere that allowed the perfect
photograph to emerge. It was a combination of his ability, rapport
and instinct."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Los Angeles in 1952, Ritts left California for the East
Coast to attend Bard College in the early 1970s to study economics.
While in college, he told his parents he was gay. His sister,
Christy, told the Los Angeles Times about her brother's announcement
in a 1999 interview: "When I found out, it was, 'Is he happy? Is he
OK?' Other than that, who cares?"</TE>
<TE>   Ritts eventually returned to West Hollywood and worked as a sales
representative for his family's furniture and accessories design
company, often selling items to movie sets. The job allowed him to
travel and teach himself photography, a hobby that later would make
his a household name, unusual for a photographer.</TE>
<TE>   Ritts was the oldest of four siblings, including brothers Rory and
Gary. All were taught by their parents, Shirley and Herb Ritts Sr.,
to respect hard work -- especially while growing up in L.A.,
surrounded by privilege. The family lived in a 27-room Spanish-style
house on 2 1/2 wooded acres in Brentwood next door to Steve McQueen.
The kids occupied a wing of the house that included a 50-foot
playroom. Chores for each were listed on a bulletin board and stars
were doled out when jobs were successfully completed.</TE>
<TE>   The Ritts clan would spend weekends at their Malibu beach house,
and often, the children were allowed to spend days by themselves --
with other adults to watch over them -- at a little cabin on a
Catalina cove during their summers. There, Ritts, the leader of the
group (he'd later become an Eagle Scout), would work pumping gas at
the dock.</TE>
<TE>   But it took a flat tire to bring out the photographer in him,
along with chance and connections that propelled him into the world
of celebrity photography. The story goes that Ritts and his friend, a
young actor named Richard Gere, whom he'd met at a potluck dinner in
1978, were driving through the desert when the Buick Le Sabre they
were driving had a flat. Sweaty from changing the tire, Gere agreed
to an impromptu photo session, posing in front of the car, his hands
behind his head and a cigarette dangling from his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun, that's all," Ritts was quoted about that time in 1979
when he used a Miranda camera with a 105-millimeter portrait lens.
Gere was an unknown then. But a year later he was a star, and Ritts'
photos showed up in magazines in the United States and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Ritts was a classic proud mom. "Herb has a fabulous way
with people and great integrity," she told The Times in a 1999
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd call and tell me to turn on the television because there was
something on about him and I'd say, 'You look great.' He'd say, 'But
Mom, how about the work?' "</TE>
<TE>   He later took pictures for album covers and directed music videos
for pop-rock artists Madonna and Michael and Janet Jackson and
crooner Chris Isaak; he also directed advertising campaigns for Donna
Karan, TAGHeuer Watches and Revlon. In 1991, two of his videos won
MTV Awards: best female video, with Janet Jackson, and best male
video, with Isaak.</TE>
<TE>   His work has been displayed at studios and museums, including the
Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where his photographs were exhibited in
a major museum for the first time, and the Victoria and Albert Museum
in London. Ritts also published several books, among them 1989's
"Men/Women" about the beauty and sensuous aura of both sexes; 1991's
"Duo," a nude study of gay couples; 1992's "Notorious" about his
unconventional success as a celebrity portraitist, and 1994's
"Africa," a study of the Masai people and the stark African
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his mother; his partner, Erik Hyman, and his
siblings.</TE>

<HD>Pilot Removed From Plane in Virginia Fails Test for Alcohol</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORFOLK, Va.</DL>
<LD>A Delta Air Lines pilot failed a test for alcohol after he was taken
off an airplane Thursday at Norfolk International Airport, airport
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Schroeder, 42, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.07, Ken Scott
of the Norfolk Airport Authority said. The Federal Aviation
Administration's limit for a flight crew member is 0.04.</LD>
<LD>   Scott said baggage screeners notified airport police after
detecting alcohol on Schroeder's breath when he arrived to co-pilot
the Cincinnati-bound flight.</LD>
<TE>   Scott said Schroeder was cooperative and agreed to board a flight
to Delta headquarters in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Delta spokesman John Kennedy said the airline was investigating.
FAA regulations prohibit pilots from drinking alcohol within eight
hours of duty. Violations can lead to license revocation.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder was cited for violating a city code that makes it
illegal for aircraft pilots to be under the influence of alcohol
while operating planes, according to police reports. A preliminary
hearing was set for Jan. 9.</TE>

<DL>UNIONTOWN, Pa.</DL>
<LD>A 12-year-old boy who died after a police chase was shot in the back,
according to autopsy results released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Ellerbe was shot and killed Tuesday after crashing a
stolen vehicle in Uniontown, about 40 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   Police said two troopers chased Ellerbe after he tried to run
away. During the foot chase, shots were fired and Ellerbe was struck
in the heart by a bullet. He died later at a hospital.</LD>
<TE>   The coroner said the autopsy showed Ellerbe had been shot in the
back.</TE>
<TE>   State police, who have placed troopers Juan Curry and Samuel
Nassan on administrative leave, refused to discuss the shooting
Thursday and have not released additional information, including
whether authorities believed Ellerbe was armed.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Hickenbottom, the boy's father, acknowledged his son would
disappear from the home at times but said, "Michael was not a problem
child."</TE>

<LD>A New York chemist who said last week that her company would soon
produce the first human clone, a baby girl genetically identical to
the mother, will make an announcement today.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for Brigitte Boisselier and Clonaid did not give a
direct answer when asked whether they will claim to have produced the
first cloned baby.</LD>
<LD>   But Nadine Gary said that Boisselier intends to have video
equipment at a news conference in Florida and would have an
"independent inspector" take DNA evidence from baby and mother.</LD>
<TE>   Many scientists are skeptical about Clonaid's ability to
accomplish the feat.</TE>

cancer and is in good health, a spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Veneman, 53, was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer in
September. Treatment included a lumpectomy, a breast-saving type of
surgery in which doctors removed the lump, then six weeks of
radiation therapy.</LD>
<LD>   Because she had treatments daily, Veneman did not travel outside
Washington after being diagnosed. She did not miss a day of work, and
officials are planning a full travel schedule for next year, the

<HD>Bush Heads Back to Texas Ranch for Long Holiday</HD>
<DH>After spending time at Camp David with family, president
makes 10th trip here this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush continued his Christmas holiday Thursday with a change
in venue, flying to his ranch in Central Texas after spending five
days at Camp David, Md.</LD>
<LD>   The president arrived at midday for what aides said would be a
10-day visit spent largely out of public view, with a minimum of
official visitors and, if his New Year's holiday last year is any
guide, a low-key schedule of family time and visits from friends.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, his wife, Laura, and their 21-year-old twin daughters, Jenna
and Barbara, spent Christmas Day at the snow-crusted presidential
retreat in the Catoctin Mountains on Maryland's border with
Pennsylvania. They were joined by the president's parents, former
President Bush and his wife, Barbara; the president's mother-in-law,
Jenna Welch; his sister and two of his brothers. Of the siblings,
only Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida, was absent.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, the family went in different directions, with the
former president and his wife heading for a three-night cruise from
Port Canaveral, Fla., to the Bahamas with son Jeb Bush and several
other family members.</TE>
<TE>   The holiday trip to the ranch near Crawford is the president's
10th visit here this year.</TE>
<TE>   Bush purchased the 1,600-acre property about six miles outside
this crossroads town shortly before becoming president nearly two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Bush stepped off Air Force One at the Texas State Technical
College airstrip in Waco, with the active Barney, his Scottish
terrier, tucked firmly under his arm. The more reserved Spot, an
English springer spaniel, scampered down the steps from the plane on
her own.</TE>
<TE>   They all headed quickly to the Marine One helicopter for the
roughly 30-mile flight to the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   The president, who flew through the autumn at a frenetic pace
campaigning for Republican candidates in the midterm elections, has
slowed down considerably in December. His attention has turned
largely toward a proposal to move up scheduled tax cuts to stimulate
the economy, the looming possibility of war with Iraq and, now,
tensions brought on by North Korea's move to revitalize its nuclear
program.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke on none of those subjects in any public setting Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a trip to Africa he planned during the second week of
January -- which would have taken him out of Washington for three
weeks out of four -- has been postponed.</TE>

<DH>House members from here will chair at least three major

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- It sounds like an item for a political Ripley's Believe
It or Not: California, well-known as a Democratic stronghold, is
gaining clout in the Republican-controlled House.</LD>
<LD>   GOP lawmakers from the state that snubbed George W. Bush in the
2000 presidential election and gave Democrats a sweep of statewide
offices last month will chair at least three major House committees
-- and maybe more -- in the new Congress. As a result, the state can
expect greater influence in snagging federal dollars and in shaping
legislation on such issues as defense, tax, trade and water policy.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody is saying, 'We're going to be the lost child out there
in a sea of Republicans,' but we might not be as lost as we think,"
said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) is expected to be named head of the
Armed Services Committee when House Republicans choose committee
chairmen in early January.</TE>
<TE>   He would join two other Californians set to retain their
chairmanships -- Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Bakersfield), who leads the
tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, and Rep. David Dreier (R-San
Dimas), who heads the Rules Committee, which decides which
legislation comes to the House floor.</TE>
<TE>   And Californians are vying to chair two other panels. Reps. Elton
Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), Ken Calvert (R-Corona) and Richard W. Pombo
(R-Tracy) are in contention for chairman of the Resources Committee,
which oversees national forests and parks. This includes millions of
acres of Western land, and the trio of Californians are among those
trying to keep the panel from being led by an Easterner.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) is running to
head the Government Reform Committee. He faces tough competition from
Rep. Thomas M. Davis (R-Va.), who is credited with helping the GOP
expand its House majority in November's election.</TE>
<TE>   California also will have three seats -- more than any other state
-- among the 10 or so Republican leaders who meet weekly with House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) to plot legislative strategy. The
three are Dreier, who earns a spot as Rules panel chairman; Cox,
chairman of the House Policy Committee, and Rep. John T. Doolittle of
Rocklin, recently elected GOP conference secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) said having Californians in
these key positions could shield the state from federal budget cuts
expected in some domestic programs. For California, he said, "maybe
it won't be as bad as it could be."</TE>
<TE>   That's because of the horse-trading that is part of the
legislative process. "Even those committees not controlled by
Californians will have to be more California-sensitive," Cox said.
"Everyone needs a favor from time to time."</TE>
<TE>   By its sheer size, California's House delegation -- 53 members,
larger than any other state's -- cannot be easily ignored. The
state's well-being is vital to the overall national economy. And the
state's profile in the House will be heightened by the Democrats'
selection of Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco as their new minority
leader.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the growing influence of the state's 20 GOP House members
that is noteworthy.</TE>
<TE>   "Considering how Democratic California has become, it is
remarkable that the Golden State will be so powerful in a Republican
House," said Larry J. Sabato, a University of Virginia political
scientist.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas and Dreier illustrate the dividends from having
Californians as committee heads. The two are credited with helping
win passage of two measures eagerly sought by the Silicon Valley -- a
tax break benefiting high-technology industries and a bill granting
the president broad authority to negotiate trade agreements.</TE>
<TE>   "On our two biggest priorities -- tax relief and trade promotion
authority -- both Thomas and Dreier came through for us," said Ralph
Hellman, vice president of the Information Technology Industry
Council, a high-tech trade association.</TE>
<TE>   With Hunter taking over as chairman of the Armed Services
Committee and Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) retaining his
chairmanship of the appropriations subcommittee on defense,
Californians will be in charge of all defense matters coming before
the House. That means the state stands to gain a good share of
defense contracts at a time of military buildup.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, in fact, recently boasted of obtaining $200 million for
San Diego defense contractors -- and he isn't even chairman yet.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Hunter and Lewis will keep watch over a burgeoning
program for the Air Force's massive C-17 air cargo jet at a Boeing
assembly plant in Long Beach, and they are expected to fight to steer
missile defense and homeland security dollars to the state.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter also could play a key role in the next round of military
base closures, scheduled by law for 2005. California has been hit
hard by closures over the last decade, and Hunter clearly will be
sensitive to concerns about the impact to the state of more
shutdowns. He also is expected to confront complaints from state
leaders that the federal government has not paid its share to clean
up old bases and convert them to civilian use.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the hottest chairmanship races, Gallegly, Calvert and
Pombo are part of a crowded field to succeed retiring Rep. James V.
Hansen (R-Utah) as head of the Resources Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Based on seniority, the job should go to Rep. Jim Saxton (R-N.J.).
But some conservative Republicans have qualms about Saxton, who was
endorsed by the Sierra Club and voted against the White House
proposal to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Also, on this committee, region matters as much as ideology. In
part because of the panel's importance to the West, no Northeasterner
has chaired it since a New Yorker's brief tenure at the helm in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly, who is just behind Saxton in seniority on the committee,
is campaigning hard for the job. He has provided GOP colleagues with
a 33-page report pledging, if chosen as chairman, to pursue an agenda
of "common sense environmentalism" and tackle such issues as
comprehensive energy legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "My voting record reflects my conservative philosophy, strong
party unity, and protection of private property rights," he wrote.
"My strong support for the Republican Party and its candidates shows
my commitment to growing our majority."</TE>
<TE>   All three Californians seeking to head the Resources Committee
have called for rewriting the Endangered Species Act to expand the
rights of property owners. All three also have supported oil
exploration in the Arctic refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Cox is in a three-way race to succeed Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.),
who must step aside as head of the Government Reform Committee
because of term limits the GOP imposes on its chairmen.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) is No. 1 in seniority to succeed
Burton. But some Republicans remain angry because he helped lead the
rebellion this year that forced a vote on campaign finance reform
over the objections of GOP leaders. Virginian Davis is considered a
top contender because of his recent work as chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, which has played a key role in
the GOP maintaining its House majority.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts suggest that the rising prominence of California GOP
House members could boost the sagging fortunes of the state's
Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   "These folks can help rescue the GOP [in California] if they can
send some pork our way," said state political analyst Tony Quinn.</TE>
<TE>   But others say Washington's political realities will make it
difficult for California's House Republicans to parlay their power
into GOP gains back home, especially with growing budget deficits
that could inhibit their ability to finance projects in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Gary C. Jacobson, a UC San Diego political scientist, noted that
on such social issues as abortion rights, the top House leaders
pursue "policies considerably to the right of the average
Californian."</TE>
<TE>   He said that will undercut efforts to "give the Republican Party a
more moderate image in the state."</TE>

<HD>Ex-President, Gov. Bush Set Off on Cruise to Bahamas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORT CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Former President Bush and his son, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, left
Thursday on a three-night holiday cruise with family and security
agents, undeterred by the recent outbreaks of stomach viruses that
have sickened some cruise passengers.</LD>
<LD>   The family was joining about 2,500 other passengers aboard the
Disney Wonder, its stern adorned with a figure of cartoon character
Donald Duck.</LD>
<LD>   The departure was delayed an hour because two of the Bush
granddaughters were late. President Bush's twin daughters Jenna and
Barbara were listed on the ship's manifest, although it was not known
whether they were the latecomers.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a personal, family vacation, a much-deserved and needed
one," said Katie Muniz, the governor's spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The ship was bound for the Bahamas under blue skies and an
unusually chilly wind.</TE>
<TE>   Jeb Bush has said he was undeterred by the outbreaks that have
sickened hundreds. More than 20 outbreaks on cruise lines are being
investigated by the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. That number is more than in the four previous
years combined.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried at all about the health issue. I'm more worried
about just being on a boat, getting along without e-mail and stuff,"
the governor said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Disney spokesman Mark Jaronski said no parts of the ship would be
restricted and that he expected the Bushes to eat in the main dining
room with the other passengers. The dozen or so relatives will be
joined by Secret Service agents.</TE>

<HD>Coast Guard Rescues 36 Cubans Abandoned on Desolate Island</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The Coast Guard rescued 36 Cubans on a desolate little island in the
Bahamas after they were abandoned by immigrant smugglers on Christmas
Eve, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The 25 men, nine women and two girls were left on Elbow Cay, which
is uninhabited and has no food or water, Coast Guard spokesman Luis
Diaz said.</LD>
<LD>   They were spotted waving for help by a Coast Guard jet as it
assisted a cutter pursuing a suspicious boat. The boat escaped into
Cuban waters.</LD>
<TE>   The Coast Guard picked up the Cubans on Wednesday and gave them
food and water. They were reported in good health.</TE>
<TE>   "Abandoning these migrants with little food or water and leaving
them is a grossly inhumane act," Coast Guard Lt. Tony Russell said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubans were turned over to Bahamian custody.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to the Bahamian consulate in Miami and its embassy in
Washington went unanswered Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Ford Agrees to Settlement in Sex Harassment Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DEARBORN, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. and a female employee who complained of sexual
harassment have agreed to settle the case, a company spokeswoman said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Ford also agreed to give managers more training to prevent similar
harassment, Ford spokeswoman Anne Marie Gattari said.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement -- the amount wasn't disclosed -- between Ford and
Jill Nabozny, an employee at its Dearborn stamping plant, requires
the approval of a federal judge.</LD>
<TE>   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which filed a
complaint in Nabozny's case last week, welcomed news of the
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "We always try to encourage settlements at all stages of the
process," EEOC spokesman David Grinberg said in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Nabozny said that she was repeatedly harassed by two male
co-workers since at least August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "She was subjected to unwelcome sexual talk, innuendoes, jokes,
touching, staring, whistling and intimidation," the EEOC complaint
said.</TE>
<TE>   One worker said he wanted to take Nabozny and two other female
co-workers to a boxcar in the back of the building for a sexual
encounter, according to the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The same co-worker fashioned a phallic object out of welding
materials and put it at Nabozny's work station, the complaint
alleged.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite knowledge of the harassment, [Ford] failed to take prompt
and effective action to correct and prevent the harassment," the EEOC
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gattari said Ford has transferred at least one of the employees
accused of the sexual harassment.</TE>
<TE>   In August, a Wayne County judge dismissed another sexual
harassment lawsuit against Ford because the plaintiff illegally
generated publicity that could have influenced potential jurors.</TE>

<HD>Cans of Kale, Turnip Greens Are Recalled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A South Carolina company is recalling almost 300,000 cans of kale and
turnip greens because they may be contaminated with salmonella, a
dangerous type of food poisoning, or other bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   Recalled are the Glory Foods brand of kale and turnip greens, sold
in 27-ounce cans throughout the country but primarily along the East
Coast, said manufacturer McCall Farms of Effingham, S.C.</LD>
<LD>   The recalled turnip greens bear the code "GK25/TGLC" on the metal
cans; the recalled kale bears the codes "GK25/KBLC" or "GK22/CGLC."
They were shipped to stores in mid-December.</LD>
<TE>   Consumers should not eat the recalled greens even if they do not
look or smell spoiled, but return them to the place of purchase for a
refund, McCall said.</TE>
<TE>   The contamination came to light when a major grocery chain spotted
swollen cans in a warehouse and alerted the Food and Drug
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   McCall said its quality-control department has found and fixed the
source of the contamination, something the FDA planned to verify.</TE>

<HD>Hillary Clinton Picked to Give Democrats' Radio Response</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Democrats have chosen Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton to give the party's
response to President Bush's weekly radio address Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   It's a first for the former first lady, and a step back to the
national stage. Since her election two years ago, Clinton has focused
on issues affecting her New York constituents and on developing
relationships with Senate colleagues.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton will urge Congress to extend federal unemployment benefits
to more than 800,000 people scheduled to lose them Saturday, said
Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for Senate Democratic leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.), who tapped Clinton for the role.</LD>
<TE>   As first lady, she helped President Clinton deliver a radio
address on the importance of mammograms, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   While Clinton aides have said consistently that she does not plan
to run for president in 2004, a poll of Democrats released last
weekend showed she would lead the field of likely 2004 candidates if
she were to enter the race.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Sets Record for Civil Prosecutions of Former Nazis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department set a single-year record by seeking to revoke
the citizenship or deport 10 former Nazis in 2002. Investigators took
advantage of recently opened archives in former communist countries
and better computer databases to find suspects in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The latest case was filed Thursday, when the U.S. attorney's
office in Brooklyn, N.Y., asked a judge to revoke the U.S.
citizenship of Jaroslaw Bilaniuk, 79, of Queens, N.Y. Prosecutors
said in a complaint that he persecuted Jewish civilians while serving
as an armed guard at a Nazi slave labor camp in Poland.</LD>
<LD>   The previous record of nine civil prosecutions in a year was
achieved twice, according to Eli Rosenbaum, director of the Justice
Department's Office of Special Investigations.</LD>
<TE>   Seventy-one people who assisted in Nazi persecution have been
stripped of U.S. citizenship and 57 others have been deported since
OSI began operations in 1979. More than 160 suspected Nazis have been
blocked from entering the United States, according to the office.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenbaum, who has worked in the Nazi-hunting program since it
began 23 years ago, said the record is remarkable considering old age
claims many ex-Nazis every year. He attributed the success to several
factors:</TE>
<TE>   * Investigators have completed their time-consuming project to
track down assets and property the Nazis looted from Holocaust
victims.</TE>
<TE>   * OSI has quick access to government records and commercial
databases and can compare names, including variations of possible
spellings in English.</TE>
<TE>   * Investigators now are able to pour through the archives of the
former Soviet-bloc countries, developing new leads.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenbaum said investigators last year found documents in Europe
that planned a massacre of Jews and listed the Nazis assigned to the
killings in Minsk, Belarus. Back in the United States, the names were
compared to databases, and a match was found with a Florida man,
Michael Gorshkow, 79.</TE>
<TE>   In July, a federal judge in Pensacola, Fla., stripped Gorshkow of
his U.S. citizenship for failing to respond to a Justice Department
complaint that he did not disclose his wartime activities when he
became a citizen in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenbaum said that in the past, investigators had to give
officials in communist countries individual names of suspects and
wait for a response -- a painstakingly slow process.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the improved techniques, "time is our greatest enemy,"
he said. "We race the grim reaper and Mother Nature, and sometimes
Mother Nature wins."</TE>
<TE>   Efraim Zuroff, the Jerusalem-based Nazi hunter for the Simon
Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles, called the single-year prosecution
record "an absolutely outstanding achievement."</TE>
<TE>   "My sense is OSI will be able to maintain the high level of
activity over the next few years because of the opening of records in
Europe and the documentation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Zuroff said other nations have not duplicated the success of the
U.S., partly due to a lack of will but also because some countries
chose the more difficult path of criminal prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   The United States concentrates on stripping ex-Nazis of their
citizenship and deporting them for crimes committed in other
countries, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Zuroff said thousands of ex-Nazis are still alive, but he could
not give a more precise number.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest complaint, the Justice Department said Bilaniuk
trained for Nazi service at the infamous Trawniki Training Camp in
Poland. Recruits there were part of "Operation Reinhard," a plan to
murder Jews in Poland.</TE>
<TE>   According to the complaint, during his training at Trawniki,
Bilaniuk was an armed guard at a slave-labor camp for Jews adjacent
to the training facility.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint also charged that Bilaniuk misrepresented his true
wartime activities when he applied for a U.S. immigration visa in
1949.</TE>

<HD>Hopes Rise With Casino at Niagara Falls</HD>
<DH>The faded resort area is counting on Indians to do what
decades of redevelopment couldn't.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>For years the Niagara Falls Convention Center was a squat eyesore in
the middle of town, a symbol of steady economic decline in a resort
city that once billed itself as the honeymoon capital of the world.</LD>
<LD>   But on New Year's Eve, the old arena with a leaky roof will be
transformed into a glittering, Las Vegas-style casino, the largest
Indian-run gambling emporium to open in a U.S. city.</LD>
<LD>   Niagara Falls is betting that slot machines and roulette wheels
will spur the revival that decades of redevelopment failed to
achieve. And it hopes to fire a warning shot across the river, where
a rival city with a similar name -- and a bustling casino -- is
raking in millions.</LD>
<TE>   "People never thought a casino would happen here, because we've
seen so many plans go up in smoke," said Brian Potter, a Niagara
Falls waiter who, like many, has grown accustomed to a sense of urban
failure. "But now it's going to open and the feeling is, let's give
it a shot. Have you got any better ideas?"</TE>
<TE>   The story of how Niagara Falls wagered its future on gambling
shows the lengths to which a declining city will go to jump on the
Indian gaming bandwagon, a booming $14-billion industry. And it
highlights a new willingness by states to shore up their sagging
economies with profits from Indian casinos.</TE>
<TE>   As gaming fever grows, more tribes are attempting to gain a
foothold in or near heavily populated areas. And even though the
Niagara Falls case is something of a quirk -- because of special
federal legislation passed on behalf of the Seneca Indian Nation that
owns the casino -- it is being closely watched nationwide as a
harbinger of similar deals elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In West Sacramento, for example, the Upper Lake Pomo tribe has
been battling to put a casino on a 67-acre plot more than 80 miles
from its ancestral home on the shores of Clear Lake. Other tribes
throughout the nation also are eyeing urban casinos.</TE>
<TE>   But critics charge that Indian gaming is a front for big
corporations and other investors, and that only a handful of Native
Americans actually benefit from gambling profits. Nonetheless, the
rush to expand Indian gambling shows no signs of slowing down. And
the biggest prizes of all are the huge casinos that, like Niagara
Falls, offer slot machines, gaming tables and complimentary alcohol
to customers, unlike the smaller facilities on reservations that are
often far from cities.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes according to plan, the new Niagara Falls casino will
be followed by a Seneca-run facility in the heart of nearby Buffalo,
as well as a third casino on tribal land. Meanwhile, New York Gov.
George Pataki is pushing to open three casinos in the Catskills
region near New York City, a long-stalled development that could
generate large profits.</TE>
<TE>   If all six open, the governor has estimated that New York's
casinos could generate $300 million to $400 million annually in
public revenue. The state will pocket 25% of the profits generated by
2,625 slot machines in Niagara Falls.</TE>
<TE>   As sponsors put finishing touches on the facility -- ripping the
plastic wrapping off hundreds of green felt blackjack tables as
they're unloaded from trucks -- officials in Massachusetts,
Connecticut and Rhode Island are debating whether to open new
casinos. Fearing competition, civic leaders in Atlantic City, N.J.,
are drawing up plans for new malls on the fabled boardwalk, as well
as blueprints for new hotel-casinos.</TE>
<TE>   All of this activity sparks angry criticism in Niagara Falls that
the city has, for all practical purposes, sold itself down the river.
Columnist S.K. Smith asked in the Niagara Falls Reporter: "Why in the
world would a gambling tourist travel to Niagara Falls, N.Y., to lose
his or her shirt? ... We'll get gamblers, people we know and perhaps
love, who bet the mortgage payment and sentence their kids to eating
macaroni and cheese for a month."</TE>
<TE>   Yet others say a casino is the last, best hope for a city that was
once a teeming resort and busy manufacturing center, but is now a
shell of itself. Perched on New York's western tip, just south of
Lake Ontario and a stone's throw from the majestic, surging falls,
the community gained a reputation as a honeymoon mecca in the 19th
century.</TE>
<TE>   The city's economy was also based on industry, however, and more
than 40% of Niagara Falls' manufacturing jobs have disappeared since
1976, the victim of a faltering upstate economy. Amid this decline,
Mayor Irene Elia and others predict that gambling will generate 2,000
jobs, pump $40 million annually into state coffers and $10 million
into the city. Already, they note, the casino is spurring talk of
hotels, restaurants and malls in a city where the jobless rate is
10.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Any economic miracle, though, will come at a price.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most Indian tribes, the Senecas did not have to go through
years of governmental review to open a casino on non-reservation
land. Like many Native Americans, they had a history of broken
promises, land grabs and forced relocations at the hands of the U.S.
government. But they also had unique leverage because the city of
Salamanca, N.Y., and other villages had signed a 100-year lease in
1882 for the privilege of existing on Seneca Reservation land. Back
then, the tribe had to accept an annual payment of $1 for such
leases.</TE>
<TE>   To make amends, Congress gave the Senecas $35 million in 1990 to
renew the leases for 40 years, and it also gave them the power to
build casinos on land beyond their reservation. The 7,000-member
tribe was allowed to buy real estate in "aboriginal" areas that it is
thought to have occupied hundreds of years ago, and this new land
instantly became Indian territory.</TE>
<TE>   A state law passed in 2001 earmarked the Niagara Falls Convention
Center as the first site of three planned casinos. As a result, the
55 downtown acres are now sovereign Seneca land, exempt from many
local regulations including the obligation to pay property taxes. The
city of 56,000 is essentially at the mercy of a tribe that insists it
will be a good neighbor and wants to spur economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been welcomed with open arms and we don't go where we're
not wanted," said Rick Armstrong, president of the Seneca Nation.
"This casino will provide immense benefit to Niagara Falls, and it
will also generate $5 million monthly to help our own people with
housing construction, schooling, new roads and the like."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Senecas are also taking an economic risk. To win financing
and meet a New Year's Eve opening deadline, the Niagara Falls casino
secured a five-year, $80-million loan from Malaysia's Genting Corp.
at an eye-popping 29% annual rate. The tribe's bid for financing was
turned down by 23 banks, Armstrong noted, because lending
institutions are reluctant to bankroll projects on Indian land where
they are not legally able to repossess a property, should there be a
default.</TE>
<TE>   The Genting Berhad Corp., which operates the largest casino in
Asia and bankrolled the Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut, insisted on
these onerous terms because of the risk inherent in the Niagara Falls
gambling project.</TE>
<TE>   But boosters look on the bright side. Although scores of Indian
tribes across the country have sought similar casino financing from
the Malaysian firm, the company picked Niagara Falls.</TE>
<TE>   "They loaned us the money because there is tremendous potential in
this area for a new casino, and we're going to break new ground,"
said G. Michael "Mickey" Brown, head of Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "And you can bet that what we do here will have a ripple effect in
the region, especially when the money starts rolling in and people
see how successful we are."</TE>
<TE>   Brown predicts that the new casino will lure customers from the
Canadian city of Niagara Falls, where 10 million visitors flock each
year to a government-run casino. Housed temporarily in an old
shopping mall, Casino Niagara has become one of Canada's top
attractions since opening in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Casino Niagara's red neon lights glitter across the border each
night, and the city's skyline is dotted with construction cranes --
an affront to those on the New York side, where there is no
construction activity other than the casino. They are eager to win
back a U.S. share of the immense gambling booty that Brown said "is
being sucked out" of Western New York onto the other side of the
surging falls.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't blame the Americans for being jealous of what's going
on here," Casino Niagara blackjack dealer Sal Canatello said. "In the
summer especially, the crowds pouring in here are amazing. Some
nights, you can't even get a seat at the tables."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond gambling profits, Canatello and other employees said Casino
Niagara has made a difference in their lives. The chance to become a
dealer "gives me a much better salary than I had before, and the
chance to build a career," said Canatello, who had been studying
computer programming before.</TE>
<TE>   Across the river, hopes are similarly high. The Seneca Niagara
Casino recently graduated its first class of blackjack dealers, 315
strong, and many believe casino jobs have rescued them from
low-paying work. More than 8,500 people applied for 2,000 jobs,
according to Mary Beth Defazio, vice president in charge of human
resources.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be making from $40,000 as a dealer, and that doubles my
previous salary," said Jessica Posluszny, a mother of two young
children who worked for eight years as a waitress in nearby
Williamsville. "I wanted stability, better benefits, and I got them
here. I'll get to work an overnight shift, and spend some more time
with my kids."</TE>
<TE>   But Defazio cautions against the belief that gambling alone can
help a hard-pressed city turn the corner.</TE>
<TE>   "A casino is like a gold mine," she said, "but like any gold mine,
you have to work it with a pick and shovel.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to make things happen around the casino, you have to
grab the opportunity. And that, more than anything, will be the
biggest challenge for a city like Niagara Falls."</TE>

<HD>Park Can't Ban Pedophile's Clown Performance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The only government-owned amusement park in the United States cannot
bar a convicted child molester from performing a clown act and
soliciting money in all public areas, according to a judge's ruling
made public Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The judge ruled that it is unconstitutional for Westchester
County, N.Y., which owns and runs Playland Park about 20 miles north
of New York, to ban solicitation in its parks. U.S. District Judge
John Martin, in a ruling dated Monday, held the county's ban is a
violation of free-speech rights.</LD>
<LD>   Playland is a recreational complex that includes an amusement park
with rides, picnic areas, paths, a beach and boardwalk, a lake for
boating and a pier.</LD>
<TE>   The plaintiff, Richard Hobbs, wants to perform a "busking act" at
the park. This would involving performing as a clown, giving away
balloon sculptures and seeking donations. Hobbs was convicted of
sexual abuse of minors in 1978 and 1982, the ruling said.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said Westchester County has invoked a regulation that was
too broad to stop Hobbs' performance based on his plans to seek
donations. The county also relied on another regulation that was too
broad to stop his act out of concerns Hobbs could be a risk to
children due to past convictions.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Manhattan federal judge held that Playland could bar
Hobbs' solicitation in the amusement park area where the county
operates a business and intends to make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   He said this area, where people are charged for rides and arcade
games, could not be considered a public forum. The judge said the
county has been consistent in its refusal to permit any activities
within the amusement area that would compete with the business of the
concessionaires who pay fees to the county for their booths.</TE>
<TE>   Hobbs can perform in certain public areas away from the amusement
park rides and other concessions, the judge ruled.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said these areas are no different from other public parks,
which have been held to be public forums where free speech cannot be
prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   He said questions remain as to which specific areas within
Playland Park are public forums and he scheduled a conference next
month to consider this issue.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Tolchin, chief advisor to the Westchester County executive,
said that while the county was gratified the judge ruled it could bar
solicitation in the amusement park area, it was disappointed Martin
had separated out other sections.</TE>
<TE>   "Our attorneys will be at the conference and then we will
determine how to proceed," she said.</TE>

<HD>Millionaire Steps Up to Claim $314.9-Million Powerball
Prize</HD>
<DH>W. Virginia contractor says he hopes to use some cash to
rehire 25 laid-off workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Already a millionaire once, a West Virginia contractor's good fortune
multiplied after a ticket he played in the Christmas Day Powerball
drawing won $314.9 million -- the largest undivided jackpot won in a
U.S. lottery.</LD>
<LD>   Dazed under a gargantuan black cowboy hat, Andrew "Jack"
Whittaker, 55, a sewage treatment contractor, showed up with his
family Thursday at West Virginia State Lottery headquarters to claim
the first $10 million of a $111.7-million lump sum that will come
next month. "I don't have good luck, I'm blessed," said Whittaker,
shaking his head as he pocketed the check from state lottery
officials. Whittaker opted for the single payment instead of 30
annual installments.</LD>
<LD>   Only hours after he realized Thursday morning that all six numbers
on his Powerball ticket matched the winning pick, Whittaker was
already musing about how he would divvy up his winnings. First, he
said he would tithe to his church. "I just want to thank God for
letting the machine pick the right numbers for me," Whittaker said.</LD>
<TE>   Once three pastors take 10% of his winnings, Whittaker said he
would put some of the cash into his three construction firms and
hoped to hire back 25 workers laid off before Christmas. He talked of
moving out of his 10-year-old brick home into a gated community. And
indulging a businessman's fantasy, Whittaker allowed that he might
finally buy a helicopter he has been mooning over for years. "I've
worked for everything I got," Whittaker said, "but this is the first
thing anybody's ever given me."</TE>
<TE>   Whittaker lives in the tiny unincorporated town of Scott Depot, 20
miles south of Charleston. He bought the ticket Monday at a
convenience store in neighboring Hurricane. He paid $100 for a block
of tickets at the C&amp;L Superserve. It is a luxury he permits himself
only when the lottery take surpasses $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured it would take that much before I could do anything good
with my winnings," Whittaker said. He joked that he may lower his
threshold to $10 million. Whittaker watched the multi-state drawing
Wednesday night but thought he had another batch of losers, though
coming close. "I thought I only got four of them because the numbers
came up wrong on the TV screen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But when Whittaker awoke just after 5 a.m. Thursday, he checked
again after he heard on the radio that the winning ticket had been
purchased at the C&amp;L. "Let me see that ticket," he told his wife,
Jewel.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at it, and sure enough, we had a winner."</TE>
<TE>   Jewel Whittaker, who has been married to her husband for 36 years
and shares his devout faith in the Church of God, said she wanted to
use a portion of her husband's winnings to tour Israel "because it's
where Jesus walked." Their daughter, Ginger McMahan, said she had
been preparing to go back to work after several bouts with cancer,
but said: "I think I'm going to retire now."</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest problem," Whittaker said, "is keeping my daughter and
my granddaughter from spending all my money in a week."</TE>
<TE>   Out on Tays Valley Road, a winding country lane in Scott Depot
where farms have been steadily replaced over the last decade with the
tract homes of middle-class commuters, neighbors gawked at the parade
of TV news vans at the Whittakers' driveway.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never had a commotion like this in all the years I've been
here," said Doris McBrayer, who lives down the street. Like many of
her neighbors, McBrayer said she knew the Whittakers "well enough to
wave hello and such," but added that "they pretty much keep to
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Coal mines dot Putnam County where the Whittakers live, but even a
resurgent mining industry has been shaken by layoffs in recent
months. Whittaker was forced to slash jobs at the three firms where
he employs 117 workers.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to get them back to work as soon as possible," he said,
adding that he hoped to do so by expanding his firms with some of his
windfall.</TE>
<TE>   Whittaker's take was the biggest Powerball prize in history,
topping a $295.7-million jackpot in July 1998. The game is played in
23 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Whittaker's was also the largest single-winning ticket in any U.S.
game of chance -- more than the historic $363-million Big Game
jackpot of May 2000, which was split by two winners.</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia officials were ecstatic at Whittaker's stroke of
luck. A state with the second-lowest per capita income in the nation,
West Virginia will get $11 million for school and senior citizen
programs from its 6.5% tax bite of Whittaker's prize, West Virginia
Lottery spokeswoman Nancy Bulla said.</TE>
<TE>   Total sales in West Virginia for the Christmas Day Powerball
lottery soared to $3.8 million -- far surpassing the state's $500,000
average lottery take. But of all the state's 1,400 lottery
franchises, C&amp;L won the $100,000 stipend reserved for the store that
sells the winning ticket. "We can't believe it was a local customer,"
store manager Amy Trogdon said.</TE>
<TE>   Whittaker is a regular at the store, showing up about 6 a.m. every
morning to buy "gas and a biscuit." When he called his lawyer
Thursday to confirm he had won, the attorney ordered him to lie low.
But by 8 a.m., Jewel Whittaker had a hankering for a biscuit, so the
couple drove into Hurricane and stopped at C&amp;L.</TE>
<TE>   After pumping his gas, Whittaker strolled inside, keeping mum
while reporters trawled the aisles, trying to learn the identify of
the lucky winner.</TE>
<TE>   "How you feeling today?" the cashier asked him. "I just won the
lottery," Whittaker whispered proudly.</TE>
<TE>   "No you didn't! You're not excited enough to win the lottery," the
cashier said. Then she pushed him out the door.</TE>

<HD>Visiting Priest Is Held on Sex Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW BRITAIN, Conn.</DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic priest visiting from Poland was arraigned Thursday
on charges he sexually assaulted a teenage girl while counseling her
about a previous sexual assault.</LD>
<LD>   Father Roman Kramek, 40, who had been serving at Sacred Heart
Church, is accused of having sex with the 17-year-old on Dec. 18,
prosecutors said. Kramek confessed to the crime in a sworn statement
to authorities, they said.</LD>
<LD>   Kramek was arrested Tuesday and arraigned Thursday on a
second-degree sexual assault charge. He was ordered held on $500,000
bail until his next court appearance Jan. 30.</LD>
<TE>   Under state law, it is illegal for psychotherapists or clergy
members to have sex with anyone they are counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Kramek told police the girl never refused his advances but never
gave him permission to touch her or have sex with her, according to
court documents.</TE>
<TE>   The Hartford Archdiocese and Sacred Heart parish said they were
unaware of the charges until they were contacted Thursday by
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "How could he do this?" said Father Paul Wysocki, the parish's
only priest. "I feel so sad."</TE>
<TE>   About 3,000 families attend Sacred Heart, more than half of them
Polish, Wysocki said. He said he has an agreement with a Polish
bishop who sends priests during the Christmas and Easter holidays
when he needs help hearing confessions.</TE>
<TE>   Father John Gatzak, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said the
archdiocese had received a letter from a Polish bishop stating that
Kramek was a priest in good standing.</TE>
<TE>   According to court papers, a counselor who was helping the victim
recover from a previous sexual assault asked Kramek in early December
whether he could offer the girl counseling.</TE>
<TE>   The priest said that he touched the girl to ascertain where she
had been touched when she was sexually assaulted previously, and to
show her that sexual relations between a man and a woman are not
always bad.</TE>
<TE>   "Father Roman stated he did this to the victim to help her," the
affidavit read.</TE>

<HD>Canadian Border Crossing May Reopen</HD>
<DH>The checkpoint in Glacier National Park has been closed to
nonresidents of the United States since last year's terrorist
attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREAT FALLS, Mont.</DL>
<LD>The National Park Service may loosen restrictions soon and allow
Canadians and some nonresidents of the United States to enter Glacier
National Park on a popular hiking trail along the Canadian border.</LD>
<LD>   The Goat Haunt Ranger Station checkpoint was closed as a security
measure after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In July, the Park Service agreed to reopen the crossing to
Americans, but it remained off-limits to Canadians and other
nonresidents.</LD>
<TE>   Amy Vanderbilt, a spokeswoman for Glacier, said the Park Service
is considering changes to that restriction.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the National Park Service's goal to allow as many visitors
to enter at Goat Haunt as we can feasibly allow," Vanderbilt said.
"But we recognize homeland security measures."</TE>
<TE>   The isolated crossing is at the heart of the Waterton-Glacier
International Peace Park along the U.S.-Canadian border. It is a
popular entry point for visitors wishing to hike in Glacier. Each
year, about 37,000 pass through the checkpoint. About 7,000 of them
stay to hike or backpack on the U.S. side.</TE>
<TE>   Vanderbilt said the Park Service and the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service have been working on a plan that would allow
Canadian or other British Commonwealth residents to cross into
Glacier. Restrictions for residents of other countries would
continue. "We feel we are very close to having a final agreement,"
she said. "We are hopeful that it will be in place for the new
calendar year. We are committed to having this in place."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Dahlen, chief of interpretation for Glacier, said Thursday
that the INS was reviewing the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a complicated issue, and there are questions that still
need to be worked out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To enter through Goat Haunt, visitors board a tour boat at the
north end of Watertown Lake in Canada. The boat takes them across the
border to the Goat Haunt Ranger Station at the lake's southern end, a
popular starting point for day hikes and backpacking trips in
Glacier.</TE>
<TE>   Wanda Robinson, co-owner of Waterton International Shoreline
Cruise Co., which operates tour boats on Waterton Lake, said she is
looking forward to changes in the Park Service policy. Business was
down about 30% over the summer, she said, and the company canceled
its morning run across the border.</TE>

<HD>Couple Accused of Fleecing Good Samaritan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEARWATER, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A homeless couple taken in by a stranger on Christmas Eve stole the
man's van, presents and groceries while he slept, sheriff's deputies
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   James Dixon was remorseful when he and Venus Dixon were arrested
Wednesday, deputies said. They said he told them, "A man took me and
my wife into his home last night, treated me as a person and a
brother, and I did him wrong."</LD>
<LD>   Earnest L. Green saw the couple Tuesday on a rainy street in
Clearwater, about 20 miles west of Tampa. He offered them a ride to
his home to dry off, eat a hot meal and spend Christmas Eve.</LD>
<TE>   "I fed them good, man," Green said. "It made their day. They
couldn't stop thanking me all that night."</TE>
<TE>   Green, 45, told deputies he awoke Christmas morning to find the
Dixons, his van, his presents, frozen food and $80 in cash gone. The
van was returned later that morning, missing its stereo and CD
player.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't look at nobody and tell what kind of people they
are," said Green, who stayed home alone to work over the holidays
while his wife visited family in Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   James Dixon, 48, was charged with burglary and auto theft. He told
deputies he left his wife at a nearby gas station, where she was
found pushing a shopping cart containing the stolen goods.</TE>
<TE>   Venus Dixon, 43, was charged with burglary, auto theft, possession
of cocaine, resisting arrest and possession of a crack pipe. Police
said she tried to swallow crack as she was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   The Dixons were jailed Thursday, a jail spokeswoman said. James
Dixon was being held on $20,000 bail, and his wife on $26,000.</TE>

<HD>Kids Win Too on 4-Day School Week</HD>
<DH>The schedule is said to cut costs, particularly in the
rural West, amid a sluggish economy and limits on federal and state
education budgets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>GRANBY, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Like good principals everywhere, Janet Liddle tries to keep up on the
activities of the 197 students here at Granby Elementary School. From
Monday through Thursday that's fairly easy, but Fridays are tough.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, about half of them will be on the ski slopes on a Friday,"
Liddle says. "A bunch might be at a concert, and some of them just
take off somewhere with their parents."</LD>
<LD>   The student body disperses every Friday because Granby Elementary,
on a snowy plateau at the headwaters of the Colorado River, has a
four-day school week. With the economic downturn and stiff new limits
on state and federal education budgets, other districts, particularly
in the rural West, are following suit, shutting down one day a week
to cut costs.</LD>
<TE>   More than 100 school districts in seven states -- Oregon, Wyoming,
Colorado, New Mexico, South Dakota, Arkansas and Louisiana -- are
using the four-day week this school year, according to the National
School Boards Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Districts in an additional half a dozen states are considering the
plan for next year, although some would require a change in state law
to make the shift.</TE>
<TE>   "You get an immediate 20% cut in your food services budget, 20% in
transportation and some savings in energy and custodial costs," said
Robb Rankin, superintendent of the East Grand School District, which
operates Granby Elementary and four schools on the four-day plan.
East Grand is more experienced with the four-day plan than most: It
started the compacted schedule in 1982, after Colorado rewrote its
annual educational requirements in response to the energy crisis of
the late '70s.</TE>
<TE>   "We've also had improvement in attendance," Rankin said, mainly
because parents schedule the dentist or the eye exam on Friday
instead of taking students out of school. "That's pretty important in
a mountain district like this one, because some of the kids have to
make a four-hour round trip to Denver to see the orthodontist. We
also schedule our teacher training and parent-teacher conferences on
Fridays so they don't take away a school day."</TE>
<TE>   The trade-off is that students in the four-day system have to go
to school 7.5 hours a day to get the same instruction that the
standard five-day, six-hour schedule provides. That means even
6-year-old first-graders have to be in class from 8:15 a.m. to 4:15
p.m. each day. "We always schedule art, music or PE as the last hour
of the day," Liddle said, "because the younger students do get
tired."</TE>
<TE>   Because the four-day schedule has been adopted mainly in small,
rural school districts, there are no large-scale studies yet of the
educational effect of the shortened week. But state officials in
Colorado, with 47 districts on the four-day system, said there is no
indication that learning has suffered.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a systematic comparison of student performance,"
said Gary Sibigtroth, the state's assistant commissioner of
education.</TE>
<TE>   "But we are seeing the same improvement on standardized tests in
the four-day schools that we have had in the traditional schools.
This system has been extremely popular with parents; about 80% say
they like the four-day plan. It would not be if there were any sign
that education was suffering."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Colorado Gov. Bill Owens issued a report card on each
of the state's public schools. The results showed no difference in
student achievement between four-day and five-day systems, the state
said.</TE>

<HD>Two Charged in Killing of 5 Family Members</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LIVONIA, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Two men were charged Thursday with murdering five family members,
including three young children who apparently walked in during a
robbery at their suburban Detroit home.</LD>
<LD>   John Wolfenbarger, 31, and Dennis Lincoln, 27, were charged with
five counts each of premeditated murder and felony murder.</LD>
<LD>   Jeweler Marco Pesce, 38; his mother, Maria Vergati, 68; and
Pesce's three children, Melissa, 6, Sabrina, 9, and Carlo, 12, were
gunned down execution-style in Pesce's home Saturday. Police said the
safe was open and the house had been ransacked.</LD>
<TE>   The killings happened after Pesce dropped his children off at his
house in Livonia, then went to his office without entering the home,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe these three children walked into a home where the
armed killers waited for them," prosecutor Michael Duggan said.</TE>
<TE>   The burglars may have forced Carlo Pesce to call his father and
ask him to come home after realizing the children did not know the
combination to the safe, Duggan said.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfenbarger and Dennis also were charged with armed robbery, home
invasion, being a felon in possession of a firearm and using a
firearm during the commission of a felony, the Wayne County
prosecutor's office said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators suspect that the two men began zeroing in on Pesce's
house sometime in early December. Pesce's 3,000-pound safe was filled
with jewels, watches and other valuables.</TE>
<TE>   A judge entered not guilty pleas on behalf of the two men Thursday
and ordered them held without bond. If convicted, they face mandatory
sentences of life in prison without parole.</TE>
<TE>   The men were believed to have been cellmates in a Carson City,
Mich., prison and were paroled earlier this year, prosecutors said.
Lincoln served nine years for armed robbery, and Wolfenbarger served
eight years for a series of burglaries.</TE>
<TE>   They were arrested Tuesday. At least one other person was arrested
in connection with the case, but it wasn't clear Thursday whether
that person would be charged.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also were seeking a court order to detain two material
witnesses who they said were reluctant to cooperate with
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses led investigators to a house in Detroit, where a police
search yielded watches, diamonds, melted gold and other items stolen
from the Pesce home.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects had been seen at the house by witnesses,
investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Police also recovered several handguns thought to be connected to
the slayings. Ballistic tests were being done Thursday.</TE>

<HD>North Comes Back to Life After Storm</HD>
<DH>Emergency crews and residents gain the upper hand in places
where up to 3 feet of snow fell over holiday. The storm has killed at
least 23 people.</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Shoppers seeking bargains shoveled through three-foot drifts in some
places and plows struggled to clear roads as the Northeast dug out
Thursday from a scenic but deadly Christmas snowstorm.</LD>
<LD>   Flakes at one point fell at the rate of 5 inches an hour in the
state capital of Albany, and 103 miles of the New York State Thruway
were closed down because plows couldn't keep up with the storm.</LD>
<LD>   But by daylight, emergency crews and residents were gaining the
upper hand. The highway reopened, as did several airports that were
forced to suspend operations.</LD>
<TE>   "It took us three hours to dig ourselves out," said Paul Cooper,
who lives with his wife, Carol, in the Hudson Valley community of
Lyonsville, N.Y., where a local newspaper headline proclaimed:
"Whiteout Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   "Irving Berlin was lucky. He didn't have to drive," Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   In Albany, where 22 inches of snow fell, travelers crowded into
the Best Western Airport motel after drifts on runways forced Albany
International Airport to close.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were a polar bear, I would be in my glory," said Patrick
Hamilton, who works at the motel's front desk. "I found some kids who
were willing to make a few bucks to dig me out."</TE>
<TE>   When Jennifer O'Leary arrived at work at 8 a.m. at Albany's Cross
Gates Mall, the assistant marketing director for the 250-store
complex found plows rapidly clearing the parking lots. "The shoppers
are all here. It's one of the biggest days -- most definitely," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The storm, which originated in the Midwest Plains and spread snow
across Pennsylvania before gaining strength from Atlantic Ocean
moisture, has killed at least 23 people since Monday. The toll could
have been far worse, but most businesses and schools were shut for
Christmas and many drivers either stayed home or already had reached
their holiday destinations.</TE>
<TE>   At the height of the storm, dozens of municipalities declared
state of emergencies to deal with the quickly falling snow. Utilities
from Pennsylvania to Massachusetts scrambled to restore power to tens
of thousands of people.</TE>
<TE>   In Centerville, about 50 miles east of Syracuse, N.Y., 34 inches
of snow was reported. About the same amount was measured in nearby
Cooperstown.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Woodstock, Vt., measured 27 inches; Goshen, Mass., 16
inches. And in Franklin, Maine, residents said the tally hit 22
inches.</TE>
<TE>   The few businesses that remained open on Christmas said many
customers stayed home.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone who came more than six miles away canceled for Christmas
dinner," said Jim McGinnis, assistant innkeeper at Barrows House in
Dorset, Vt. "Most of them are not from this area. They are mostly New
Yorkers, Bostonians, not used to a lot of snow like this."</TE>
<TE>   "Up here, there is a different attitude toward driving. We drive a
little slower and our vehicles have studded winter tires," he said.
"It makes a difference. Everyone gets around.... All the plows were
out, and life went on. It was just a little slower."</TE>
<TE>   Brad Rosenstein, president of Jack's Oyster House, a landmark
restaurant in Albany, said waiters planned to serve about 600
customers on Christmas. About 300 people showed up.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it is the cost of doing business in the Northeast," he
said. "We have plenty of food from yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   As the storm moved northward, the amounts of snow increased. In
Manhattan, where 5 inches fell on Central Park, the flakes quickly
turned to slush.</TE>
<TE>   "I will take full credit for being the first mayor in 31 years to
deliver a white Christmas," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg joked.</TE>
<TE>   But north of the city in the Hudson Valley leading to Albany,
there was far less humor. The snow, whipped by fierce winds, caused
whiteout conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "Yesterday, we went to a Christmas dinner at my son-in-law's and
daughter. We were able to get there OK, but coming back was such a
blizzard, I was doing four or five miles an hour," Cooper, of
Lyonsville, said. "My kids said, 'Mommy, Daddy, please call us when
you get home.' They were only a mile and a half away."</TE>

<HD>Bush Officials Try Again on a Strategy to Protect Wetlands</HD>
<DH>New policy outlines what mitigation needs to occur if the
complex ecosystems are destroyed. A previous attempt was criticized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Striving to fix a controversial policy announced late last year, Bush
administration officials unveiled a plan Thursday to stop the loss of
wetlands across the country.</LD>
<LD>   The first stage in a multiyear, multi-agency strategy will take
effect today when the Army Corps of Engineers issues its revision of
a much-criticized guidance letter, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The guidance letter specifies what kind of mitigation Corps
engineers can allow to make up for wetlands that developers destroy
during construction of roads, buildings or other projects. When it
was released in October 2001, the guidance letter was broadly
attacked by environmentalists in Congress and across the country as
the Bush administration's abandonment of the goal of "no net loss" of
wetlands, set by former President Bush in 1989.</LD>
<TE>   Wetlands -- marshes, swamps and bogs -- are complex ecosystems
that can serve a variety of valuable roles. They improve water
quality, control floods, diminish droughts and stabilize shorelines.
They also are home to many rare or endangered plants and animals.</TE>
<TE>   Before the 1970s, wetlands were destroyed indiscriminately because
their ecological value was not broadly acknowledged. By the 1970s,
the contiguous United States had only half as much wetland area as it
did 200 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The new policy is a direct response to criticisms of the initial
guidance letter and an effort to bring the nation's approach to
wetlands mitigation in line with recommendations the National Academy
of Sciences made last year, said Ben Grumbles, assistant
administrator for water at the Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also outlined 16 steps they plan to take to ensure that
developers avoid destroying wetlands when possible and act more
responsibly to protect ecosystems if wetlands must be destroyed
during building projects.</TE>
<TE>   "These actions affirm this administration's commitment to the goal
of no net loss of America's wetlands and its support for protecting
our nation's watersheds," EPA administrator Christie Whitman said in
a draft news release.</TE>
<TE>   But critics are holding off final judgment until they see the fine
print in the Corps' guidance letter.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased to see them at least initially taking the right
steps to examine how to improve mitigation, given its high rate of
historic failure," said Julie Sibbing, a wetlands policy specialist
for the National Wildlife Federation, an environmental organization.
"But we'd like to see real concrete commitment to improving
mitigation right now."</TE>
<TE>   Grumbles said the revised guidance letter specifically directs
Corps engineers to consider the recommendations of the National
Academy of Sciences and the goals of watershed preservation and no
net loss of wetlands. It also requires engineers to avoid wetlands
loss when possible.</TE>
<TE>   He said that as a result of the revised letter, engineers will
less frequently allow developers to compensate for lost wetlands by
planting trees and shrubs near waterways, or fashioning new wetlands
in another location.</TE>
<TE>   The new policy sets deadlines for officials to decide about the
techniques that developers can use to make up for wetlands losses in
the future.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of next year, the federal agencies must produce a
policy stating when developers can compensate for a lost wetland by
creating a new wetland in another location.</TE>
<TE>   By 2004, officials will have to decide whether developers can
compensate for lost wetlands by constructing vegetation buffer zones,
which can serve only some of the purposes of wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   Sibbing stressed that the government would not be living up to its
no net loss goal if it allowed developers to compensate for
destroying wetlands by planting trees or shrubs along a waterway.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they're not making up for anything destroyed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The new policy also requires federal agencies to produce an annual
nationwide report card by 2005, assessing how effective the
mitigation efforts have been at protecting ecosystems and watersheds.</TE>
<TE>   "The net effect is it's going to ensure greater accountability and
a watershed-based approach to analyzing what types of wetlands
mitigation should be used," Grumbles said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government lacks up-to-date data on the loss of
wetlands nationwide. But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has
estimated that an average of 58,000 acres of wetlands was lost
annually from 1956 to 1987. The loss slowed significantly over the
next decade, according to the National Academy of Sciences. But the
goal of no net loss of wetlands is far from being met, the academy
said.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Pins Its Airport Hopes on Palmdale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Oldham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirty-one years after hundreds of people crowded into the Palmdale
Airport terminal to watch Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty dedicate the
facility, a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire and secured with
a heavy brass padlock guards the entrance.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the lofty visions on that muggy June dedication day of
Palmdale as a bustling regional airfield, a notion revived recently
by Mayor James K. Hahn, that was the last time the building would
host so many patrons at once.</LD>
<LD>   These days, four years after Palmdale's last flight, tumbleweeds
bounce along the cracked asphalt ramp. A coyote lopes down the
deserted access road past rusting farm machinery. An inch of dust
lines empty ticket counters.</LD>
<TE>   The airport's lone employee, Brandon Eaton, says many people have
forgotten the facility exists.</TE>
<TE>   "Even people who live up here don't realize that there's a
terminal tucked away down here," the superintendent of operations
said during a recent tour. "I'm standing here today with a facility
capable of handling 300,000 people. I have a parking lot with 360
spaces."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials are acutely aware of the empty airport's
presence, and hope to base commercial air service there again soon.
Hahn has made the aging facility a centerpiece for his plan to
redistribute air traffic around Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Sharing the load among the region's six airports is crucial if
Hahn is to enforce a cap of 78 million passengers at Los Angeles
International Airport. He has proposed the cap as part of his
$9.6-billion modernization proposal there.</TE>
<TE>   To meet the limit, the mayor must persuade airlines to move
commuter service to airports such as Palmdale, which could
accommodate as many as 4 million travelers by 2025, according a
forecast by the Southern California Assn. of Governments.</TE>
<TE>   That figure compares with the 48,500 travelers who flew into or
out of Palmdale in its peak year, 1990. The number dwindled to fewer
than 19,400 -- an average of 53 a day -- by 1997. The last carrier
pulled out in 1998, citing lack of interest in its service.</TE>
<TE>   Serious planning to return service to Palmdale began under Mayor
Richard Riordan, when Palmdale officials and the Los Angeles agency
that operates the airport hired a consultant to study its potential.
The study found that the region could support air service at Palmdale
and officials were poised to present the findings to several airlines
-- on Sept. 10, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Given Hahn's goal, officials are again urging carriers to provide
service at Palmdale. They have approached a few since August, said
Bob Haueter, a senior deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike
Antonovich, whose district includes the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing really couldn't be better," Haueter said. "Some
airlines expressed an interest in providing service, even after 9/11.
We're going to follow up with those."</TE>
<TE>   Major Obstacles</TE>
<TE>   Among the hurdles that must be overcome to bring this dusty desert
outpost to life is the reluctance of the airlines, still reeling from
a poor economy and the terrorist attacks, to expand service to
markets near major airports.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the airport's growth is limited by a lease agreement
with the Air Force, which owns the runways, and by various
environmental issues that could stymie expansion plans. Also, it's
difficult get there from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But Palmdale officials aren't discouraged. They say the community
has grown more affluent, and its educated, well-heeled population
could support flights to communities as far flung as Dallas, Denver,
Las Vegas, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Sacramento and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to replace LAX," said David Meyers, president of
the Greater Valley Economic Alliance, a nonprofit promotional group.
"There are very few areas in the country like this that don't have an
airport. Markets similar in size to ours supported airline service
with far fewer people with less buying power and businesses."</TE>
<TE>   About 625,000 residents live in the airport's "catchment area,"
which Meyers said includes parts of the Antelope and Santa Clarita
valleys and Inyo and San Bernardino counties. Several areas with
strong regional airports are smaller, such as Colorado Springs,
Colo., with 509,000 residents, whose airport offers 51 daily flights,
and Boise, Idaho, with 415,000 people, where 79 flights take off each
day from Boise Airport.</TE>
<TE>   But both Colorado Springs and Boise are hundreds of miles from the
nearest major international airport. Palmdale is about 50 miles from
Burbank Airport and 66 miles from LAX, a distance that some carriers
consider too short to justify new routes.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles World Airports came to give us a presentation ... and
we agreed to listen," said Janice Monahan, a spokeswoman for America
West. "But nothing came of it."</TE>
<TE>   Shorter Routes</TE>
<TE>   Despite this setback, Eaton, Palmdale Airport's superintendent of
operations, remains optimistic. He says the existing terminal is a
perfect home for 70-seat regional jets favored by the airlines for
shorter routes. Many airlines have turned to these planes to cut
excess capacity from the system.</TE>
<TE>   Horizon Airlines disagrees -- at least for now. The carrier has
received dozens of requests from facilities such as Palmdale to start
service with its regional jets, forcing it to set priorities for
where it will go first. Palmdale isn't on that list, said Dan Russo,
Horizon's director of marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be taking delivery of more jets between now and 2005 and,
as we get closer to that, we will be making decisions on how to
deploy those," Russo said.</TE>
<TE>   To entice carriers, the Los Angeles agency that operates Palmdale
is discussing incentives, including free rent and pro bono marketing
of flights. The city of Palmdale has also considered what's known as
a "travel bank" to attract air service.</TE>
<TE>   Five communities, from Pensacola, Fla., to Eugene, Ore., have
raised $8.6 million since 1999, using such banks to attract carriers
to smaller airports. A travel bank is formed when businesses put a
percentage of their travel budgets into an escrow account and
withdraw from the account for employee travel on a certain airline.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Stockton persuaded America West to provide two daily
flights to Phoenix from its airport after several dozen companies and
individuals raised $800,000 for prepaid travel. Like Palmdale, the
airport had lacked commercial service for five years, requiring
residents to drive at least an hour to another airport.</TE>
<TE>   Travel banks are "even more viable, with economic problems and
after 9/11," said Mike Boggs, manager of airport business services
for Mead &amp; Hunt Inc. He said they are designed to do two things:
influence airline decisions about service by "giving a community an
edge and make a carrier successful for the long term in a market."</TE>
<TE>   Limit of 25 Flights a Day</TE>
<TE>   Even if airlines decide to offer service from Palmdale, an
agreement between the Los Angeles airport agency and the Air Force
allows only 25 flights a day. The agency leases the terminal, runways
and parking lot from the Air Force. It owns a huge tract adjacent to
the military installation where it hopes to expand eventually.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force lease, which will run until 2017, will allow the
airport agency to increase operations at the existing terminal to 200
flights per day if it completes additional environmental studies.</TE>
<TE>   The airport agency is drafting a master plan for Palmdale Airport
that will look at how an expansion would affect the desert
environment, research its effects on freeway traffic and air
pollution and analyze the demand for passenger and cargo service.</TE>
<TE>   Several endangered species may live among the brush that covers
the site, including the Mojave ground squirrel, the western burrowing
owl, the desert tortoise and native plants, said Scott Harris, an
associate wildlife biologist at the California Department of Fish and
Game. Draft changes to the Los Angeles County General Plan designate
35% of the airport site as an environmentally sensitive area.</TE>
<TE>   If the airport agency decided to expand the existing terminal, or
to build a new facility, it would be required to search for the
endangered species and complete detailed biological reports.
Environmental issues aside, the agency's lease with the Air Force
bars it from starting construction soon on the 17,750-acre site owned
by the Los Angeles airport agency and adjacent to the military
property.</TE>
<TE>   "If they wanted to develop the land next door for an airport they
can't, according to the joint-use agreement, until they get to a
three-month average of 200 operations a day," said Lt. Col. Celeo
Wright, commander at the facility, Air Force Plant 42.</TE>
<TE>   Airport supporters say they are also concerned that poor highway
access could hamper the facility's growth.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people use the 14 Freeway to commute to and from the Los
Angeles Basin," said James Ledford, Palmdale's mayor. "That could be
a detriment to the airport if we can't give passengers assurance they
can get up here on time to meet a flight. This is something that
needs to be overcome today."</TE>
<TE>   Regional officials suggest improved rail service and a dedicated
beltway from Los Angeles to Palmdale, similar to a highway complex
that links Dulles International Airport with Washington, D.C. Both of
these ventures would be likely to cost millions and are not currently
included in transportation planning for the area.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Airport Commission recently granted a right of way
that would allow the California Department of Transportation to build
a 5.3-mile expressway to connect Palmdale Airport with the Antelope
Valley Freeway. Caltrans hopes to complete the $165-million, six-lane
expressway by 2010. The agency still needs $140 million.</TE>
<TE>   County planners say access and other infrastructure issues are
important, but they're not crucial to starting service at the
existing terminal.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to make that airport grow and go to a
regionalization approach, you will have to do more up there, as far
as infrastructure and access," said Haueter, the deputy to County
Supervisor Antonovich. "But those things don't stop us from beginning
right away to provide some service."</TE>
