<HD>Last Man Standing-- AOL's Case Still a Target</HD>
<DH>Critics question his skills as a long-term visionary, but
his supporters rally behind him</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Case finally has something to do at AOL Time Warner: fight for
his job.</LD>
<LD>   Case, often criticized as missing in action during the company's
continuing woes, survived a lobbying campaign for his ouster last
week by some directors and institutional investors who are
dissatisfied with his performance. But his future as chairman remains
in question.</LD>
<LD>   The boyish former Pizza Hut manager, who built the world's largest
Internet company, must prove he can provide value to the world's
biggest media giant that he helped create--but at a time many inside
the company don't want his help.</LD>
<TE>   On Wall Street, Case's credentials as a salesman have been
tarnished by the company's stock slump and a government investigation
of questionable advertising deals, which were made while Case was in
charge of America Online.</TE>
<TE>   Critics are questioning his skills as a long-term visionary, and
AOL Time Warner Chief Executive Richard Parsons is unwinding some of
the cross-company synergies once advocated by Case.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Internet unit in Dulles, Va., where Case, 44, made his
name and keeps his primary office, is under the stewardship of young
new leaders who don't need the old boss pitching his ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Which raises the question: What's left for Case to do?</TE>
<TE>   Case and other AOL Time Warner executives declined to comment for
this report.</TE>
<TE>   But privately, sources said the question of Case's future has set
off a war of words inside the company.</TE>
<TE>   It was Case who, at the peak of the dot-com craze, used America
Online's fast-rising stock to purchase one of the world's most
respected media companies, Time Warner. Since the merger in January
2001, however, AOL Time Warner's shares have lost about three-fourths
of their value, closing Friday at $12.53 on the New York Stock
Exchange. And the ballyhooed synergies of AOL's Internet business and
Time Warner's movie, record, publishing and cable empire have never
clicked. In the spring, then-CEO Gerald Levin resigned under
pressure. And in July, Robert W. Pittman, former chief executive of
America Online and then co-chief operating officer of the combined
company, also resigned.</TE>
<TE>   As the last top executive from the Internet side of the company,
Case is resented by those who say America Online behaved arrogantly
after the merger and then failed to tend its business. They question
what Case has been doing for the last year and say his presence
causes more harm than good.</TE>
<TE>   "Time Warner people feel completely ripped off and sold down the
river and condescended to" by AOL executives, including Case, said a
Warner Bros. executive.</TE>
<TE>   Case's defenders quickly note that it was never his job as
chairman to oversee day-to-day operations. In fact, they say, Time
Warner executives insisted that he stay behind the scenes to avoid
confusion about who was running the company.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the deal," said one senior official at America Online.
"It's ironic that they complain about it now. Are they inviting him
back in?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reconceptualizing</TE>
<TE>   Case supporters also dismiss the notion that he has no role in
helping to turn around the Internet unit, noting that he helped hire
Jonathan Miller, the new America Online chief, and has been welcomed
back to help reconceptualize the online service as it tries to switch
more customers from dial-up to faster broadband Internet service. In
the hallways of the Dulles headquarters, some employees have hung
signs reading, "We support you Steve" and "We love you Steve."</TE>
<TE>   Case helped to close a big partnership deal with Sony Corp. to
deliver next-generation online entertainment on broadband home
networks. And he was key in recruiting Robert M. Kimmitt, former U.S.
ambassador to Germany, to lead AOL Time Warner's lobbying office in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But for most of 2001 he was out of sight, spending much of his
time with his brother, investment banker Dan Case, who was ill and
died of brain cancer in June.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say removing Case would do little to help the parent
company recover.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really see how it would change what they're up against,"
said Nicholas Truitt, a money manager with Strong Asset Management,
which owns about 3 million AOL Time Warner shares. "Anyone who gave
away more than half the value of their Time Warner shares is
justifiably upset, but [ousting Case] doesn't solve the problem."</TE>
<TE>   About nine months ago, Case began to be pressed to take a more
active role in the media company, particularly as Levin prepared to
exit.</TE>
<TE>   Case earlier this year gave an inspirational speech to the troops
in the Atlanta offices, where Turner Broadcasting Systems operates
cable channels such as CNN, TBS and Cartoon Network. "He scored big,"
said one executive, who said staffers were relieved to hear Case's
call for more long-term thinking after they had endured cost-cutting
that had crippled morale. But divisional executives say there have
been no memos, e-mails or speeches from Case since then.</TE>
<TE>   He spends little time at the parent firm's New York headquarters,
although some company leaders had nudged Case to spend more time
there as Levin was leaving. They hoped a higher profile would remind
Wall Street that AOL Time Warner still was an "Internet-charged"
company.</TE>
<TE>   Few now want to remind Wall Street of that.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a much debated topic within the company recently is
whether to drop AOL from the parent company's name. Some say dropping
AOL would tarnish the brand, but others worry that the name is a
constant reminder to investors about how they were burned. But many
agree that as long as Case is chairman, the AOL name will stay.</TE>
<TE>   And at the moment his job looks secure. AOL Time Warner bylaws
require a three-fourths vote of the board, or at least 11 of the 14
members, to remove Case. Although board members Stephen F.
Bollenbach, CEO of Hilton Hotels Corp., and Francis T. "Fay" Vincent
Jr., former major league baseball commissioner, are among those
leading the campaign against Case, sources said, Parsons and others
have expressed support.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What Role for Case?</TE>
<TE>   Case's future may depend upon how hard he is willing to fight.
He's never appeared to enjoy the day-to-day management tasks of
corporate leadership and has not shown signs of missing a more active
role, those close to him say.</TE>
<TE>   Although he fell off the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans this
year (with his fortune dropping from $1.5 billion in 2000 to less
than $550 million this year), Case still has plenty of money to
retire comfortably. Last year, he bought a 22,000-acre ranch in
Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   But those close to Case say he wants to stay. He has survived
previous corporate battles--including attempted takeovers of America
Online by Microsoft Corp. and AT&amp;T Corp.--and steered the company's
growth despite some predictions of its demise.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, Case often was ridiculed by techies for pushing a
"dumbed down" version of the Internet, which was plagued with
connection problems that frustrated users.</TE>
<TE>   But Case stuck to his consumer-friendly online service and ended
up squashing nearly every other Internet service provider. AOL was
quick to realize the potential of instant-messaging and the company
still dominates that popular service.</TE>
<TE>   Case is no quitter, supporters say. In fact, he tends to thrive in
adversity. "He's a survivor," said Julia Wilkinson, a former AOL
manager and author of "My Life at AOL." "He's always tried to accept
criticism, see what's true and try to do better."</TE>

<HD>Chip Makers Try to Score With Gamers</HD>
<DH>Computers: Intel and AMD boost marketing, encourage
development of faster software in hopes more consumers will upgrade
their PCs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the going gets tough, the tough play games.</LD>
<LD>   With the semiconductor industry in the doldrums, chip makers Intel
Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. are coaxing game developers to
churn out bigger, faster games to give consumers a reason to run out
and buy new computers.</LD>
<LD>   Intel and AMD always have helped software developers create
programs that can soak up microprocessor power, but they recently
have picked up the pace with game geeks. The reason: U.S. chip sales
stumbled 44% in 2001, while sales of computer games grew 4% to $1.42
billion.</LD>
<TE>   "Chip companies are trying to exploit every reason they can think
of to persuade people to upgrade, and PC games are a great big reason
for a lot of consumers," said Steve Koenig, an analyst with market
research firm NPD Intelect.</TE>
<TE>   Intel in particular has become far more aggressive in the last few
months. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip company paid more than $1
million, a record, to have its logo placed in an upcoming game from
Electronic Arts Inc. called "The Sims Online." It also launched
several print advertising campaigns aimed squarely at gamers, ramped
up its sponsorship of game industry events and significantly expanded
its budget for joint marketing efforts with game publishers.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be outdone, AMD has devoted a team of four programmers to
keep close tabs on game developers.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't cater to gamers," said Mark de Frere, a marketing
manager for AMD in Sunnyvale, Calif. "We pander to them."</TE>
<TE>   The chip companies say they are happy with the results.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to understand gamers a little better, build and
cultivate a relationship with them, and hope they'll recommend us to
their friends and families," said Brian Favel, Intel's marketing
manager for consumer desktops. "Thus far, we've been extremely happy
with the results. We're getting more people in the gaming industry
coming to us looking for partnerships, and we're getting a lot of
positive comments on enthusiast Web sites. We're really trying to
take the time to listen and understand what they need."</TE>
<TE>   Why all this attention?</TE>
<TE>   Office applications such as spreadsheets and word processors have
plateaued in their requirements for additional
central-processing-unit--or CPU--horsepower, but games continue to
advance in their hunger for speed.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we got into the 400-megahertz range, most Microsoft Office
users got all the power they needed," said Peter Glaskowsky, editor
of Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. "But games can use
up all your CPU power, and they always will be able to.</TE>
<TE>   "If game developers suddenly got 10 times the power, they can
instantly use it up just by adding 10 times more monsters in the
game," Glaskowsky said. "But games have also been making the monsters
smarter so they don't just stand there when you shoot at them. They
duck and lure you. It's called artificial intelligence, and it's
something game developers have been adding incrementally over time to
take advantage of the processing power."</TE>
<TE>   Take "EverQuest," an online game produced by Sony Online
Entertainment. When the title debuted 3 1/2 years ago, it needed a
166-MHz Pentium-class processor and 32 megabytes of random access
memory, or RAM. For the latest title due out next month, "EverQuest:
Planes of Power," Sony will recommend an 800-MHz Pentium III
processor and 512mb of RAM.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've done is drive customers to upgrade their systems to
play the game," said Scott McDaniel, vice president of marketing for
Sony. "So we've essentially forced an upgrade path with every product
launch."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grass-Roots Inspiration</TE>
<TE>   Games also played a crucial role in launching the graphics-card
market in the mid-1990s. Titles such as "Quake" and "Need for Speed"
sparked consumer demand for graphics cards that can render lush
environments and deliver fast, smooth game action.</TE>
<TE>   Computer gamers are happy to play along and traditionally are
among the first to upgrade their PCs and push the limits of
processing power. For years, gamers traded tips on how to "overclock"
CPUs by taxing the chips beyond their advertised speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Intel and AMD have long recognized the grass-roots contribution of
gamers, not only with their purchasing power but also with their
influence over nontechnical buyers who seek their advice. AMD in
1998, for example, worked with Id Software to make a special version
of "Quake II" that specifically took advantage of AMD's chip, an
engineering process called optimizing. The title helped seal AMD's
reputation among gamers.</TE>
<TE>   But until recently, such efforts were informal, particularly at
Intel.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, it was much more opportunistic," said Yves Blehaut,
senior vice president of Infogrames Inc., which publishes powerhouse
titles such as "Neverwinter Nights," "Unreal Tournament" and
"Civilization III" and is working with Intel. "Now it's much more
coordinated, much more strategic."</TE>
<TE>   Intel started a program three months ago to place its Pentium 4
chip logo on the back of computer game packaging, something AMD also
has done for years. Intel last year also began sponsoring game
tournaments such as the Cyberathlete Professional League and the
Fragapalooza.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tech Help for Developers</TE>
<TE>   From the game industry's point of view, chip companies offer two
things. The first is marketing resources, such as tournament
sponsorships and joint advertising. Intel, for example, paid a large
portion of the expenses for a bus that toured national cities
trumpeting Sony's "EverQuest."</TE>
<TE>   Chip companies also offer technical help. Intel and AMD regularly
offer to send engineers to help game developers exploit their chips'
capabilities. The help ranges from answering technical questions over
the phone to sitting beside developers writing code. For example, San
Francisco-based Discreet, which makes software tools for game
developers, sets aside a desk just for Intel engineers.</TE>
<TE>   Some developers decline the hands-on engineering help, especially
if it involves substantial changes in the game's internal code to
tailor the game for a particular chip.</TE>
<TE>   John Carmack, who develops the "Doom" and "Quake" game series,
said he turned down several such offers. Aside from taking advantage
of a CPU's added speed, optimizing a game, as the practice is called,
doesn't yield enough of a performance kick to be worth the effort to
maintain the code base over time, Carmack said.</TE>
<TE>   "At most, you're talking about 10% to 15% increase in
performance," he said. "I just find that in most cases, it's not
worth the effort."</TE>

<HD>During Dark Times, a Bright Vision for the Future of Energy</HD>

<LD>In a week when the price of oil rose to $30 a barrel because of fear
of war with Iraq, and the ministers of the OPEC members said they
would do nothing to bring the price down, it might seem a funny time
to be thinking about where the energy industry will be decades from
now.</LD>
<LD>   But the head of the world's third-largest oil company told a Los
Angeles audience not to worry about OPEC's hold on supplies, that
natural gas will be the fastest-growing energy source of the next few
decades and that ultimately the world will enjoy</LD>
<LD>   an economy powered by</LD>
<TE>   hydrogen fuel cells.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Watts, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, may well be
onto something.</TE>
<TE>   In a matter of only a few decades, he notes, Europe's energy
economy has been transformed by natural gas from Algeria, Russia, the
North Sea and gigantic fields in the Netherlands. "Now there are webs
of pipelines crisscrossing Europe, providing clean fuel for
electricity, which used to be generated by burning coal," he says.</TE>
<TE>   A geophysicist from Leeds University in England, Watts foresees
similar webs of pipelines forming across China and India to transport
natural gas from Russia and the Central Asian regions of the former
Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   But the most compelling part of Watts' vision could have a
particularly huge effect here in Los Angeles, the car-clogged town to
which he came last week to speak to a roomful of businesspeople and
academics: "Our present form of mobility is unsustainable," he said
with a northern British accent. Translation: Our automobiles and the
fuels that power them must change.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, Shell is in a research venture with Toyota
Motor Corp., General Motors Corp., Michelin Group and other companies
to find solutions to the sustainability problem.</TE>
<TE>   Watts predicts that the automobile industry will develop hydrogen
fuel cells from small-scale models that initially will power
bicycles. Down the road, fuel cells for motor vehicles will be
distributed in six-packs, just like soft drinks. The equivalent of
one gallon of fuel will drive a car for 75 miles, according to a
planning scenario of the Shell research staff. One-fourth of all the
vehicles in the U.S., Europe and Japan will be powered by such fuel
cells by 2025, the company's engineers predict.</TE>
<TE>   In looking beyond the present, of course, Watts was not just being
optimistic. He was also being a salesman, promoting a major line of
Royal Dutch/Shell's business.</TE>
<TE>   A big part of his message was that natural gas will provide an
increasing proportion of America's energy--not just gas from U.S. and
Canadian fields but "liquefied natural gas from Australia and
Sakhalin Island" off the coast of Siberia.</TE>
<TE>   Not coincidentally, Shell is the world's leading producer of
LNG--liquefied natural gas. The company taps gas in Nigeria,
Australia, Oman and Malaysia, chills it to a liquid and transports it
in special tankers to terminals on the U.S. East Coast and other
spots around the world, where the liquid is re-gasified. The process
solves the problem of getting the stuff across oceans, where
pipelines can't be laid, to far-flung markets. Despite the
complexity, LNG now can be landed in the U.S. at prices comparable to
those for conventional natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   Shell, which invests $8 billion a year in such projects, has major
ambitions for natural gas around the globe. It is planning to build a
4,000-mile pipeline across China to transport natural gas from
Central Asia. Shell also is trying to participate in a $25-billion
natural gas development project in Saudi Arabia. And the company is a
major player in exploring for and producing gas and oil in the Gulf
of Mexico. What's more, Shell is working on a giant gas development
project on Sakhalin Island that will supply energy to Japan, Korea
and China.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, Shell is building an LNG terminal north of
Ensenada, Mexico, from which it will ship the gas into the U.S. It
also is hoping to construct such a terminal on Mare Island in San
Francisco Bay and would like to have one near Los Angeles, though
objections from environmentalists have prevented such projects so
far.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Shell is making immediate moves in U.S. markets,
paying $4 billion to acquire Texaco service stations from
ChevronTexaco Corp. and $3 billion to buy Pennzoil-Quaker State Co.,
maker of lubricating oils. And Shell, which has become the largest
retailer of gasoline in the U.S. market, is spending $500 million to
spruce up its brand at its service stations.</TE>
<TE>   But if Watts foresees the importance of oil waning, why is his
company spending so much on gas stations and lube oils? Because like
all businesses, Shell must battle in the present while planning for
the future.</TE>
<TE>   And in the present, Shell hasn't been faring as well as its giant
rivals. Royal Dutch/Shell didn't take part in the late-1990s rounds
of mergers that saw Exxon acquire Mobil, BP buy Amoco and Arco and
Chevron merge with Texaco. The combinations gave these other
companies a smorgasbord of fresh projects to expand oil and gas
reserves worldwide and to bring fresh vigor to refining and marketing
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Shell must play catch-up to get back to the profitability levels
of the other majors, note analysts such as Mark Flannery of Credit
Suisse First Boston and Steven Pfeifer of Merrill Lynch. Both have
written extensive reports on Royal Dutch/Shell's stock, which trades
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Watts is first to admit that the dramatic changes he foresees for
the energy market are not going to happen any time soon. Asked when
U.S. energy dependence on the unstable Middle East would abate, the
bespectacled 57-year-old replied bluntly: "Perhaps in my
grandchildren's lifetimes."</TE>
<TE>   So how seriously should one take Watts' grand forecasts about the
energy future, especially about cars powered by six-packs of fuel
cells? Quite seriously. Certain companies have an ability to look
back over their history, which in the case of Royal Dutch/Shell began
in 1895 with oil developments in Indonesia, and see how the world has
changed before.</TE>
<TE>   As Watts well knows, the world will change again. It's a long-term
vision, to be sure, but it's not a pipe dream. Working toward it is
more useful for "sustainable mobility" than worrying about OPEC.</TE>

<HD>'Everybody' Doesn't Know the Score on Credit Ratings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: In preparation for getting a mortgage, I recently closed
three credit card accounts that I'd opened more than 10 years ago but
hadn't used much lately. Everybody I talked to told me these unused
accounts should be closed as a way of improving my credit score,
because otherwise it would look like I had too much available credit.
But recently you wrote that closing accounts is a bad idea. Who's
right?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Certainly not "everybody."</LD>
<LD>   Here's the word straight from Fair, Isaac &amp; Co., the company that
created the three-digit credit score that's used by most lenders:
Closing accounts can never help your score, and may hurt it.</LD>
<TE>   Once more, with feeling: Closing accounts can never help your
score.</TE>
<TE>   Many lenders do indeed look askance at people who have too many
open lines of credit. (What's too many? Fair Isaac's not saying,
unfortunately, although it seems to depend on how long you've had
credit and how you use the credit you've got.) They fear the consumer
could suddenly max out their cards and then default.</TE>
<TE>   But once you've gone ahead and opened the line of credit, you
can't help your score by shutting it off. That's because the credit
score looks at the difference between the balances on your accounts
and your available credit (your total credit limit). Suddenly
reducing your total available credit makes the balances you carry
look a lot bigger in proportion, and that's not good.</TE>
<TE>   This is true even if you pay off your credit cards and other
accounts in full each month. The score doesn't distinguish between a
balance that's paid off and one that's carried from month to month.</TE>
<TE>   You also goofed by closing older credit lines. Part of your credit
score depends on how long you've had credit. Those 10-year-old
accounts enhanced your credit history by showing you've responsibly
used credit for a significant period of time.</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, you have at least four or five credit accounts still
open. That's the minimum that mortgage brokers say they like to see
when arranging home loans.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, remember to apply for new credit sparingly and only
when absolutely necessary. That, and paying your bills on time every
time, is the best way to improve your credit score.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Credit Bureau Can</TE>
<TE>   Look Into Dispute</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have a dispute over a car lease that's driving me crazy. I
turned in a leased car early to get a better deal on a new car. The
dealer that leased me the new car made the final two payments on the
older car. The original dealer called me, however, and insisted that
I owed $600 for missing hub cabs.</TE>
<TE>   After a long negotiation, I agreed to pay, but a lower amount than
what the dealer wanted. Now my credit history shows a negative mark,
because the car company is reporting a settlement--meaning I paid
less than I owed. I wrote the car company and got no response. I
finally spoke with someone at one of the credit bureaus, who told me
not to worry about it because the settlement was so old that it would
be dropped from my report in two months. Is there anything I can do?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes, but by the time you do it, the issue probably will be
moot.</TE>
<TE>   You have the right to challenge any information you think is
incorrect on your credit report. As you already have tried to resolve
this with the company, your next step is to formally ask your credit
bureau to investigate the item. (The credit bureau has a form that
walks you through this process; just call and ask.)</TE>
<TE>   The credit bureau is required to query the original creditor. If
the creditor doesn't confirm the item, it must be dropped from your
credit report.</TE>
<TE>   The car company may stick to its guns. After all, you did pay less
than originally requested. It's too late to help you now, but part of
your negotiations with the company should have included a demand that
your credit report would not be adversely affected by this
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   You could keep fighting this, but there's really not much
point--especially if the negative item will fall off shortly.</TE>
<TE>   As for your second question, the only possible answer is: It
depends. The good news is that your credit score is more concerned
with your recent behavior than what you've done in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Although charge-offs, delinquencies, late payments and collections
will hurt your score, a recent history of on-time payments and
responsible credit use can start to improve your score almost
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   You'll still feel some of the effects from those bad marks until
they drop off your report--usually within seven years, although a
bankruptcy can stay on as long as 10 years.</TE>

<HD>Consumers Can Ease Costs of Insurance</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homeowners insurance rates are expected this year to notch their
biggest increase in more than a decade--rising by as much as 50% in
some cases. But there are a few steps consumers can take that might
make a dent in their rates.</LD>
<LD>   The steps are simple: shopping around for better rates, taking on
more risk by raising your deductible and making sure you're getting
all available discounts. But the savings can be significant. In some
cases, policyholders can cut their premiums in half.</LD>
<LD>   "It pays to be insurance-savvy these days," said Pete Moraga,
spokesman for the Insurance Information Network of California, a Los
Angeles-based industry group. "Consumers have a lot of control. They
just have to understand how to use their power."</LD>
<TE>   The biggest savings go to those willing to accept a bit more risk,
industry experts say. By increasing the deductible on a homeowners
policy to $1,000 from $250, a policyholder can shave as much as 40%
off the annual premium, said Robert Hunter, director of insurance for
Consumer Federation of America.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cutting Premium</TE>
<TE>   For example, the cost of a sample $200,000 policy for a Sacramento
homeowner with a $250 deductible would be $1,016 annually, Moraga
said. Raising the deductible to $1,000 would lower the premium by
almost a third to $717--an annual savings of $299.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the policyholder's risk has increased by only $750--the
difference between the old deductible and the new one.</TE>
<TE>   The average homeowner files a claim just once every eight to 10
years, according to insurance experts.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, who raised the deductibles on his own insurance policies,
cautions that policyholders who aren't flush with cash need to be
disciplined enough to sock away the money they save on premiums.
Otherwise, they could end up with an insurance claim--and a higher
deductible--that they're ill-equipped to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter created a "casualty account" in which he sets aside the
money he saves because of the higher deductible on his homeowners
policy. He taps this account whenever he has a costly home repair,
effectively self-insuring his minor losses.</TE>
<TE>   "I've become my own adjuster for minor claims, and I have to say,
I give myself excellent service," Hunter quipped.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how that strategy would work using the sample policy cited
above. If this consumer opts for a policy with a $1,000 deductible
rather than a $250 deductible, is an average risk and made a claim
once every eight years, the savings between claims would be $2,392.
Even after paying the higher, $1,000 deductible on a claim, the
policyholder would end up $1,642 ahead. Because the difference in
premiums is so large, this homeowner would end up ahead even if
claims were made as frequently as once every three years.</TE>
<TE>   Another benefit to setting up a deductible-savings account: As the
account grows, policyholders can afford to raise their deductibles
further, Hunter said. And there are even bigger savings available to
those willing to boost their deductible to $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   "The bigger change you make, the greater the savings," he said.
With the previous example, going to a $2,500 deductible would cut the
premium to $594--a savings of $422, or 41% annually. However, to
break even, this policyholder needs to go at least 5 1/2 years
without a major claim because the risk has risen by $2,250--the
difference between the old $250 deductible and the new $2,500
deductible.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Finding Discounts</TE>
<TE>   Discounts are another way to save on homeowners premiums, experts
say. Not all insurers offer them, and they vary widely among
insurers. Some, for instance, offer a discount to those without pets;
others give a price break to nonsmokers because they're less likely
to burn down the house. Some common discounts:</TE>
<TE>   * If both auto and homeowners policies are with the same company,
the insurer typically will offer a multi-policy discount that can
shave 5% to 10% off the cost of either one of those coverages.</TE>
<TE>   * Deadbolts and security systems can reduce a premium by 5%, but
the actual savings will vary based on location. In low-crime areas,
the savings probably will be less. But in high-crime areas, these
security measures may be required to get a policy, Moraga said.</TE>
<TE>   * Fire suppression systems and tile roofs--both of which can make
a house less susceptible to fire--can save a homeowner as much as 10%
a year, Moraga said. In rural areas susceptible to brush fires, a
fire-retardant roof may be required to buy a policy outside of the
state's high-risk insurance pool.</TE>
<TE>   Pet-free families--or those willing to let their insurers take
liability for dog bites off their policy--can save even more. Mercury
Insurance will cut rates substantially for those willing to exclude
the dog from the coverage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shopping Around</TE>
<TE>   It's also important to go rate-shopping every few years, Hunter
said. Even if you bought the least expensive policy five years ago,
there's no guarantee that your company still offers the best rates.
In fact, insurance rates are based on each company's experience with
losses. If your company has suffered higher losses than others, it's
probably going to raise rates.</TE>
<TE>   For example, premium increases this year range from 10% to 50%,
said Don Griffin, assistant vice president at the National Assn. of
Independent Insurers.</TE>
<TE>   "Shopping is key," Hunter said. "You can easily pay twice as much
for exactly the same coverage from one company to another.
Periodically, you need to take a look at the market and see if you're
still getting the best rate for what you need."</TE>

<HD>Toward a Theory of Reel Time</HD>
<DH>THE CONVERSATIONS: Walter Murch and the Art of Editing
Film, By Michael Ondaatje, Alfred A. Knopf: 384 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BOORMAN</AU>
<BD>John Boorman is the co-editor of Projections and has
directed such films as "Deliverance," "Hope and Glory," "The Emerald
Forest," "Point Blank" and "Excalibur."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jean-Luc Godard said to me, "You have to be young and foolish to make
a film. If you know as much as we do, it is impossible." We were
watching a first-time director blissfully pursuing his vision,
protected from the complexities of the process by his delirious
ignorance. Each time he was on the edge of disaster, the cameraman,
the assistant director, the actors stepped in and caught him just
before he fell. Later, he was lucky to find a good editor to help him
shape these accidents and inspirations. Had he been very lucky,
indeed, he might have got Walter Murch.</LD>
<LD>   Starting out as the guru of the soundtrack, Murch has become one
of the great film editors. He is a perfect foil for Francis Ford
Coppola, who, while a consummate filmmaker, has always retained his
belief in the primacy of chance and never lost his affection for
chaos. Murch, while protecting the creativity, will find a
mathematical structure to contain it. He compares the Coppola and the
Alfred Hitchcock methods:</LD>
<TE>   "It has to be said--both systems have their risks. The risk of the
Hitchcockian system is that you may stifle the creative force of the
people who are collaborating with you. The film that results--even if
it's a perfect vision of what somebody had in his head--can be
lifeless: It seems to exist on its own, without the necessary
collaboration either of the people who made the film or even,
ultimately, the audience. It says: I am what I am whether you like it
or not. On the other hand, the risk with the process-driven film is
that it can collapse into chaos. Somehow the central organizing
vision can be so eaten away and compromised by all the various
contributors that it collapses under its own weight."</TE>
<TE>   I advise young filmmakers that the ideal is to carefully plan and
pursue your vision but be open to the moments of inspired chance that
can be contained within it. Very difficult. Akira Kurosawa describes
how his films became more and more formally defined, shooting only
exactly the shots he needed. This method makes for great intensity
and concentration. The cast and crew know that every time the camera
turns, the shot will be in the movie. In the cutting room he often
found he needed to shorten a scene or wished he had a close-up for
emphasis. However, he feared that to shoot extra shots of this and
that, just in case, would compromise his method. His solution was to
employ a second cameraman to shoot something on every scene on his
own initiative. Kurosawa never printed his material unless he got
into trouble in the editing. Then he would take a look. In this way
he combined formality with the random.</TE>
<TE>   The poet and novelist Michael Ondaatje, a man steeped in film
history, became absorbed by Murch's views and methods during the
making of his acclaimed book "The English Patient." "The
Conversations" is made up of a series of conversations they conducted
over a long period of time.</TE>
<TE>   Ondaatje writes of Murch: "He is a true oddity in the world of
film. A genuine Renaissance man who appears wise and private at the
centre of various temporary storms to do with filmmaking.... He has
worked on the sound and/or picture editing of such films as 'American
Graffiti,' 'The Conversation,' 'The Godfather' (Parts I, II and III),
'Julia,' 'Apocalypse Now,' 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'
'Ghost' and 'The English Patient.' Four years ago he recut 'Touch of
Evil,' following Orson Welles's ignored fifty-eight page memo to
Universal. He has written 'In the Blink of an Eye,' a sort of 'Zen
and the Art of Editing,' as pertinent for writers and readers as it
is for filmmakers and audiences. But he is a man who also lives
outside the world of film, the son of an artist whose theories and
attitudes on art have deeply influenced him. He can sit at the piano
and play 'the music of the spheres,' based on the distance of the
planets from one another, translated by him into musical chords. And
in recent years he has been translating the [Italian prose] writings
of Curzio Malaparte into [English poetry] ... as well as campaigning
to revive the discredited theories of the 18th century astronomer
Johannes Bode."</TE>
<TE>   At first sight he seems absurdly overqualified for a job that is
generally considered to be a combination of the mechanical and the
intuitive. I have often written about the film process and described
it as a language that everyone can understand but that is fiendishly
difficult to speak. Whether in scripting, shooting or editing, we
fumble and feel our way in a morass of trial and error, inspiration
and correction. Our only guide--the rule of thumb. In moments of
epiphany many filmmakers experience the insight that cinema will
evolve into something we cannot yet imagine. We catch a glimpse of it
when occasionally we achieve those rare heart-leaping cinematic
moments when the elements transcend themselves into something
ineffable. "The English Patient" achieved more than its share of
those. Walter Murch has been developing a theory of what this future
thing could be.</TE>
<TE>   "I think cinema is perhaps now where music was before musical
notation--writing music as a sequence of marks on paper--was
invented. Music had been a crucial part of human culture for
thousands of years, but there had been no way to write it down. Its
perpetuation depended on an oral culture, the way literature's did in
Homeric days. But when modern musical notation was invented, in the
eleventh century, it opened up the underlying mathematics of music,
and made that mathematics emotionally accessible. You could easily
manipulate the musical structure on parchment and it would produce
startlingly sophisticated emotional effects when it was played. And
this in turn opened up the concept of polyphony--multiple musical
lines playing at the same time. Then, with the general acceptance of
the mathematically determined even-tempered scale in the
mid-eighteenth century, music really took off. Complex and emotional
changes of key became possible across the tonal spectrum. And that
unleashed all the music of the late eighteenth and the nineteenth
centuries: Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Berlioz, Brahms, Mahler!</TE>
<TE>   "I like to think cinema is stumbling around in the 'pre-notation'
phase of its history. We're still doing it all by the seat of our
pants. Not that we haven't made wonderful things. But if you compare
music in the twelfth century with music in the eighteenth century,
you can clearly sense a difference of several orders of magnitude in
technical and emotional development, and this was all made possible
by the ability to write music on paper. Whether we will ever be able
to write anything like cinematic notation, I don't know. But it's
interesting to think about."</TE>
<TE>   This is not just idle speculation. He has been working toward it:</TE>
<TE>   "There are underlying mathematical influences that determine how a
film gets put together, which are amazingly consistent, seemingly
independent of the films themselves. Over the years, I've come to
rely on these influences--navigation points--as I work on each film.
For instance: 2.5--an audience can process only two and a half
thematic elements at any moment; 14--a sustained action scene
averages out to fourteen new camera positions a minute; 30--an
assembly should be no more than thirty percent over the ideal running
length of the film. But these are perhaps just islands above a larger
submerged continent of theory that we have yet to discover."</TE>
<TE>   He also has his own theory of the origins of film. He claims that
cinema became what it is because it coincided with Thomas Edison,
Beethoven and Gustave Flaubert. Edison for the technology, Beethoven
for structure, Flaubert for realism.</TE>
<TE>   "When you listen to Beethoven's music now, and hear those sudden
shifts in tonality, rhythm, and musical focus, it's as though you can
hear the grammar of film--cuts, dissolves, fades, superimposures,
long shots, close shots--being worked out in musical terms. His music
didn't stick to the previous century's more ordered architectural
model of composition: it substituted an organic wild,
natural--sometimes supernatural--model.</TE>
<TE>   "And then along came film: a medium ideally suited to the dynamic
representation of closely observed reality. And so these two great
rivers of the nineteenth century--realism from literature and
painting, and dynamism, from music--surged together within the
physical framework of film to emerge, within a few decades, in the
new artistic form of cinema."</TE>
<TE>   He is immensely stimulating, although he fails to acknowledge that
the underlying power of the movies is that they so closely
approximate the condition of dreaming and connect us to the wonders
and horrors of the unconscious. I believe the future of film lies in
those dark depths, to the heirs of Luis Bunuel, in the twisting ways

<HD>The Sage of Common Sense</HD>
<DH>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, By Edmund S. Morgan, Yale University
Press: 340 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.W. BRANDS</AU>
<BD>H.W. Brands is the author of "The First American: The
Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin" and "The Age of Gold: The
California Gold Rush and the New American Dream."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The English novelist and critic D.H. Lawrence didn't like Benjamin
Franklin. "I haven't got over those Poor Richard tags yet," he wrote.
"I still rankle with them. They are thorns in young flesh."</LD>
<LD>   Mark Twain spoke more satirically than Lawrence, but no more
charitably, in describing his own encounter with Franklin. "His
simplest acts ... were contrived with a view to their being held up
for the emulation of boys forever--boys who might otherwise have been
happy.... With a malevolence which is without parallel in history, he
would work all day and then sit up nights and let on to be studying
algebra by the light of a smouldering fire, so that all other boys
might have to do that also or else have Benjamin Franklin thrown up
to them." John Adams judged Franklin to be vastly overrated. Adams
called his famous contemporary "the old Conjuror" and said Franklin's
life was "a Scene of continual Discipation."</LD>
<LD>   Edmund Morgan disagrees, and devotes this "purposely short" book
to explaining why. Begun as a preface to a digital edition of
Franklin's papers, it is not so much a biography, in the
cradle-to-grave sense of relating a life, as an appreciative inquiry
into the mind of America's foremost polymath--"a letter of
introduction to a man worth knowing, worth spending time with."</LD>
<TE>   "Benjamin Franklin" reflects its origins, relying almost entirely
on Franklin's letters and printed works. It also reflects Morgan's
scholarly interests. A professor emeritus of history at Yale, Morgan
has authored several distinguished volumes on the American Colonial
experience and the social and intellectual construction of an
American identity therein. Franklin provides Morgan with a revealing
case study; by examining Franklin's changing views on citizenship,
obligation, empire and authority, Morgan goes far toward explaining
America's decision for independence from Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin's first step toward independence was personal: He ran
away from home at 17. In doing so he rejected family (he was
apprenticed to his elder brother), authority (he violated his
indenture in doing so) and religious orthodoxy (he had got into
trouble with the Puritan establishment that governed Massachusetts
and tried to control its conscience). Morgan says little about the
physical journey that carried Franklin from Boston to Philadelphia,
but he says much about the moral and intellectual journey that
carried Franklin from predestinarian Congregationalism to
latitudinarian deism. "Morality or virtue is the end, faith only a
means to obtain that end; and if the end be obtained, it is no matter
by what means," Franklin concluded, in words that were heresy to the
Cotton Mather crowd. Turning convention on its head, he declared,
"Sin is not hurtful because it is forbidden, but it is forbidden
because it is hurtful." Thus Franklin arrived at a central tenet of
the dawning Enlightenment: that man is the measure of morality, not
morality of man.</TE>
<TE>   From this Franklin derived his own rule of social conduct. "I
would rather have it said, he lived usefully, than, he died rich," he
told a friend with whom he had been reflecting on the far end of the
mortal coil. Few people have made themselves more useful to their
contemporaries than Franklin. As a beginning businessman, he gathered
several others in like circumstances to form a discussion club
devoted to self-and civic improvement. When the club came up short on
reading material, he organized America's first lending library. After
fires ravaged Philadelphia, he founded a firefighting company. He
raised money for a hospital, chartered the school that became the
University of Pennsylvania, conceived the American Philosophical
Society and mustered the Pennsylvania militia.</TE>
<TE>   In each of these initiatives, he struck a nice balance between
personal interest and public interest, operating on the
premise--which he confirmed in practice--that what served
Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, and made the city and colony more
comfortable and cultured, served all who lived there, including
Franklin. This coincidence of the public and private prompted some to
see Franklin as a master manipulator who used the larger community to
further his own ends; he may not have helped his reputation by
frequently disguising his sponsorship of the initiatives. He had
thought to spread the credit and thereby speed the work, but he
raised suspicions as to what he might be hiding.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan covers these civic projects, but he is more interested in
the evolution of Franklin's political philosophy. Citing, as Franklin
did, Edmund Burke to the effect that when people start talking about
their rights, government is already far gone, Morgan draws a nice
distinction between Franklin's theory of right (as what might be
given) and prevailing theories of rights (as what is owed). After
discontent began to bubble up in Boston and other parts of America,
Franklin argued that by demanding more, Americans would get less. He
clung to his belief that accommodation was possible between the
Americans' desire to run their affairs as they had for more than a
century, and the British government's need to tighten up the
administration of the empire. As the agent of the Pennsylvania
Assembly (and later of other Colonial assemblies) to the government
in London, Franklin sought to convince both sides that requests would
be more productive than demands, and that insistence would provoke
resistance.</TE>
<TE>   For his mediating pains he earned the distrust of both parties.
American radicals thought that he was too British, British
conservatives that he was too American. He inadvertently provoked an
uproar by leaking letters from British officials in Massachusetts, in
which they said that the rights of the Americans must be abridged to
curb the political violence. Franklin had hoped to blame growing
difficulties on these few bad apples, forcing their recall and
appeasing the Boston radicals. But the radicals read the letters as
evidence of a grand conspiracy against America, and meanwhile the
British treated the leak as an unpardonable breach of trust. Franklin
was rhetorically hanged, drawn and quartered in a vitriolic session
in the London "Cockpit," the Privy Council,  which effectively
completed his conversion to the idea that the colonists must become
Americans because they could never be fully British.</TE>
<TE>   In the pantheon of American Founders, Franklin is often accounted
the sage of common sense, in contrast to such supposedly deeper
thinkers as James Madison, James Wilson and Alexander Hamilton.
Franklin indeed had more common sense than most, but, as Morgan
demonstrates better than anyone else to date, he also had a subtle
and coherent philosophy of nationality, of representation and of
administration. Here Morgan's sharp focus on Franklin's
writings--Morgan says his book "is the result of reading everything
on the disk and in the volumes [that is, the digital and printed
versions of Franklin's papers] but not much else"--usually serves
readers well, but not always. Morgan dismisses Franklin's work at the
Constitutional Convention in a few sentences, at least in part, one
supposes, because Franklin wrote little about his work there. But, as
notes kept by Madison make clear, Franklin interjected himself at a
couple of crucial moments to help the convention get past
difficulties created by the intransigence of the more vocal
delegates. (To the surprise of many, Franklin advocated opening each
session with a prayer. His point was not to elicit divine
intervention, in which he didn't believe, but to remind the delegates
that none had a monopoly on wisdom. His motion was rejected, with
Hamilton reportedly saying that foreign assistance was not required.)</TE>
<TE>   Readers expecting a full life of Franklin will be disappointed at
seeing little of various aspects of the life that don't relate to
Franklin's politics. Many of his personal affairs--the operation of
his printing business, his pursuit of land grants in the American
West, his relationships with his wife, Deborah, and especially with
his son William, whom he disowned during the American Revolution--are
treated cursorily or not at all. Similarly scant attention is paid to
much of the context in which Franklin lived and operated, so that
readers unfamiliar with the terrain of the 18th century will often
wonder about individuals and influences with whom and which Franklin
came into contact.</TE>
<TE>   But for an introduction to the mind of Franklin--one of the most
inquisitive, productive and engaging minds of his or any other
day--readers can't do better than this incisive volume. Had it been
available to Lawrence and Twain, they certainly would have thought
better of Franklin. (Adams probably would have judged Franklin more
overrated than ever, with Morgan the latest to fall under the
Conjuror's spell.)</TE>

<DH>WAR TORN: Stories of War From the Women Reporters Who
Covered Vietnam, By Tad Bartimus, Denby Fawcett, Jurate Kazickas,
Edith Lederer, Ann Bryan Mariano, Anne Morrissy Merick, Laura Palmer,
Kate Webb and Tracy Wood, Random House: 292 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES E. CACCAVO</AU>
<BD>James E. Caccavo is a writer, photographer and former
editor who worked in Vietnam from 1968 to 1970 for the Red Cross and
Newsweek magazine. He is a trustee on the Indochina Media Memorial
Foundation and a contributor to the Requiem book and exhibit project.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>War is an equal opportunity abuser. It wounds or kills whomever it
wants, whenever it wants, regardless of age or gender. But for women
wanting to cover the war in Vietnam, the news media in the 1960s were
not equal opportunity employers. Women covering the war were
confronted with more than one adversary. Besides the North Vietnamese
Army and the Viet Cong, women had to deal with discouraging attitudes
from their employers and American military brass.</LD>
<LD>   Wes Gallagher, managing editor of Associated Press, told reporter
Tad Bartimus, "I will never send a woman to Vietnam," and United
Press International foreign editor Bill Landry told reporter Tracy
Wood, "I don't believe women should cover wars." AP's foreign editor,
Ben Bassett wouldn't even allow women to work on the foreign desk in
New York. But these women persevered, eventually changing these men's
minds.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign desk editors thought women in war zones would be too
sensitive. They were right, but not in the way they expected. That
sensitivity produced some of the most moving reports. Thanks to the
determination and professionalism of a small group of female
correspondents in the Vietnam War, women today have opportunities in
journalism that were formally denied.</LD>
<TE>   Denby Fawcett of the Honolulu Advertiser quit her job at the
higher-paying Honolulu Star-Bulletin when that paper refused to send
her to Vietnam. Fawcett had to pay her own way to Vietnam to
freelance for the Advertiser. Of the nine contributors to "War Torn,"
five had to pay their own way over. The most novel was Jurate
Kazickas' winning $500 on the TV game show "Password" to fund her
one-way ticket to Vietnam in 1967. Laura Palmer followed a boyfriend
doctor to Vietnam and got a job with ABC radio in 1972. Edith Lederer
went to Vietnam first as a tourist in 1972, and AP bureau chief
Richard Pyle later became instrumental in convincing Gallagher to
assign Lederer there. When she showed up in Saigon for her first day,
Lederer was wearing blue bedroom slippers because she broke a heel on
one of her shoes boarding her flight to Saigon. "Not the image I had
in mind," she reflected.</TE>
<TE>   When Gen. William Westmoreland ran into Fawcett in the field, he
was shocked to see the daughter of his Honolulu neighbors putting
herself at such risk, and he promptly banned female correspondents
from field operations by prohibiting them from staying overnight. It
wasn't a matter of censorship but of safety both for the women and
for the soldiers who would risk their lives to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   But these young women, most in their 20s, threw political
correctness and chauvinism out the door of a Huey chopper and banded
together to change the directive. Anne Morrissy Merick, a producer
for ABC News, and Ann Bryan Mariano of he Overseas Weekly
successfully lobbied the Pentagon to retain women's right to
battlefield access. Despite the lifting of the ban, the Marines--as
before--continued to provide female correspondents with Marine
escorts in an otherwise open and uncensored war. The last we would
see.</TE>
<TE>   I first met Ann Mariano in 1966 when I was working as a staff
writer for the Overseas Weekly in Frankfurt, Germany. Reading her
chapter, "Vietnam Is Where I Found My Family," in "War Torn" brought
a rush of personal memories as she recalled, with poetic grace, the
joys of meeting her future husband, Army officer and future ABC News
correspondent Frank Mariano, and the adoption of their two Vietnamese
daughters, Katey and Mai. Most moving, however, was the post-Vietnam
tragedies that fell upon her family. Now she is struggling with
Alzheimer's disease, which she describes as "blowing through my
memory like wind through a Buddhist sand painting."</TE>
<TE>   War is the most extreme of human experiences, and women confront
their emotions differently than men. They may be more vulnerable and
sensitive to human suffering around them, but they have the inherent
discipline and courage to confront and deal with their own emotions.
"War Torn" is honest, heart-wrenching and laced with self-deprecating
humor. In "These Hills Called Khe Sanh," Kazickas writes: "I watched
as Withers held his dying buddy in his arms. The moment was so
intimate, so raw, so tender, it took my breath away. It was not the
first time I had seen unabashed love the men showed one another on
the battlefield. Soldiers in Vietnam were not afraid to express their
deepest emotions. They hugged each other and sobbed openly in the
aftermath of a firefight."</TE>
<TE>   When Kazickas was wounded at Khe Sanh, she was brought into the
bunker aid station where Marines went into a stir to provide her a
bit of privacy with hung blankets.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting in the bunker for further medical aid for her face,
Kazickas wrote how, "In spite of myself, I began to cry--for the
first time since I had come to Vietnam more than a year ago ... Even
during the months of covering battles and witnessing the carnage of
war, I had avoided tears. I had convinced myself that if I broke
down, it would prove that women didn't belong in war.... The
repressed sadness and weariness that had filled my soul for the last
year in Vietnam suddenly surfaced in a painful flow of memories. I
thought of all the men I had seen die the loneliest and ugliest of
deaths in muddy trenches or putrid jungles. It was all such a
terrible waste."</TE>
<TE>   Kate Webb of UPI wrote how "[m]ost of the wounded had their feet
blown off by peanut-butter mines [small anti-personnel mine about the
size of a C-ration can of peanut butter]. Gray faced, in shock, in
morphine-blocked pain, they would yell for us to find their feet
before they boarded [the medevac helicopter]--clinging to the grisly,
severed boots and the hope that the surgeons could sew their feet
back on again. This is a place where marines wear dogtags on their
boots." Webb was captured, held by North Vietnamese for 23 days and
mistakenly reported as dead before her release, which she also writes
about in "War Torn."</TE>
<TE>   But there is also humor here, and it surfaces at the most
unexpected moments, just as it did in the war. Webb recalls: "Not
that we didn't have our embarrassing times. As I marched out into
leech-infested paddies one day, my turn came to pass a top sergeant
handing out condoms. (Soldiers would use the powdered condoms to
shield their genitals from the intruding leeches.) 'Jesus, Katie, I
don't have a cork!' he said."</TE>
<TE>   In the chain of essays, there is only one weak link that reads
like a production schedule report, "My Love Affair With Vietnam,"
written by Morrissy Merick, who was, in fairness, not a writer. But
the others reach up from the page and grab you by the heart, pulling
you down into the experience and emotions of those days ... and the
aftermath, which would affect all of these remarkable women in the
years to come.</TE>
<TE>   The only disappointment for me in the book was the little
reference to Vietnamese women. It is ironic, considering that Gloria
Emerson's introduction describes an American student who upset her at
a college lecture: " ... A young woman came up to me and solemnly
said: 'I'm so glad a woman was there to see it.' Her remark so
shocked me that I turned my back on her. It was as if she was
dismissing all the Vietnamese women whose lives were deformed by the
war, the many Vietnamese women in the South who risked torture and
death in opposing the Americans and their Vietnamese allies; and the
American nurses who cared for the wrecked soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   Vietnamese women are among the strongest because of the
generations of war they have survived. I saw these same qualities in
the American women who came to Vietnam as nurses, Red Cross workers
and as correspondents. But despite their obvious professionalism and
courage under fire, they were still looked after by seasoned
correspondents and military men. It's something men need to do.</TE>
<TE>   The women in "War Torn" also write about their involvement with
the people around them, from their love affairs to the children of
the streets. Palmer wrote, "I never loved the way I did in
Vietnam.... Like a jealous lover, Vietnam could be relentlessly
demanding. But the mystery is like the heart of love itself, Vietnam
gave back far more than it ever took from me."</TE>
<TE>   Bartimus, who still suffers from "acute onset autoimmune disease"
she suspects she got from defoliant exposure in the war, recalled a
little street girl in Saigon who sold leis of jasmine blossoms: "In
the beginning, I bought as many leis as she had left in the red
dishpan at curfew. But soon she claimed me as a friend, lying in wait
to leap out of the shadows and grab my arm. To her there were two
kinds of people, customers and friends. By and by, friends didn't
have to pay. One night, when I reached for my wallet out of reflex,
her oval face crumpled and her doe eyes dulled. 'For you, from me,'
she said touching her heart, then mine. 'Please.' "</TE>

<HD>An American Terrorist</HD>
<DH>JESSE JAMES: Last Rebel of the Civil War, By T. J. Stiles,
Alfred A. Knopf: 512 pp., $27.50</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC FONER</AU>
<BD>Eric Foner is the author of "The Story of American
Freedom" and "Who Owns History? Rethinking the Past in a Changing
World."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the 1960s, when I was a college student caught up in the folk
music craze, one of my favorite songs was "The Ballad of Jesse
James."</LD>
<LD>   "He stole from the rich and gave to the poor," is the one line I
now remember. Like many other things I thought I knew about America's
most famous outlaw, James' reputation as a latter-day Robin Hood is
far from the truth. Midway through "Jesse James: Last Rebel of the
Civil War," T.J. Stiles notes rather laconically that there is no
evidence that the James gang "did anything with their loot except
spend it on themselves."</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, the image of Jesse James is as important as the man
himself. Hundreds of outlaws robbed banks and committed murders in
the post-Civil War era, but virtually all except James are now
forgotten.</LD>
<TE>   And one of the major contentions of this new biography is that
James' enduring renown rests not so much on his considerable success
as a bandit as on his mastery of public relations. James, Stiles
shows, was a publicist for himself. He forged a close working
relationship with a newspaper editor who penned laudatory accounts of
his exploits, and he wrote numerous letters to the press. On one
occasion he even distributed what Stiles calls "a prepared press
release" to startled train passengers during a robbery that not only
exaggerated his height but offered a detailed apologia for his
actions.</TE>
<TE>   Stiles effectively places James' career of crime in the context of
the turmoil in Civil War-era Missouri, a state on the border between
slavery and freedom and internally divided among the industrial city
of St. Louis, a large area of small farms using free labor and a
string of slaveholding counties known as Little Dixie. In a violent
era, Missouri was an especially violent place. Before the Civil War,
its "border ruffians" poured into Kansas to take part in the battles
between pro-and anti-slavery settlers. During the war, Missouri
remained within the Union, but pro-Confederate guerrillas murdered
slaves and unarmed pro-North civilians and Unionist bands preyed on
Confederate sympathizers.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse James was born in 1847 in Clay County, a stronghold of
slavery in western Missouri. His father, a Baptist preacher, died
three years later in California, where he had gone in an effort to
bring religion to participants in the Gold Rush. James was raised by
his mother, Zerelda, a resourceful and strongly pro-slavery woman.
Young Jesse grew up alongside slave children and was raised, in part,
by a slave woman. But this does not seem to have affected his
outlook. Rather than a romantic outlaw, Stiles argues, James was a
pro-slavery murderer, a forerunner of what we would today call a
terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   In 1864, at the age of 17, Jesse joined the guerrilla band of
"Bloody Bill" Anderson, "the personification of horror," as Stiles
calls him, who tortured prisoners and murdered more than 20 unarmed
Union soldiers after seizing them from a train. After the surrender
at Appomattox, while most Confederate veterans integrated themselves
back into peaceful life, James formed a gang that assassinated
civilians who had supported the Union. Then, in 1869, he embarked on
a series of daring and usually successful bank and train robberies.</TE>
<TE>   Stiles is not the first scholar to link James' crimes to the
volatile environment of wartime Missouri. But more than any previous
writer, he places the emergence of James as a larger-than-life
figure, a hero in the eyes of Missouri's ex-Confederate Democrats, in
the context of the divisive politics of Reconstruction. For a time,
radical Republicans controlled the state. They enhanced the rights of
the emancipated slaves and imposed loyalty oaths to keep
ex-Confederates from power. Democrats, who soon regained power in
Missouri, were themselves divided between Unionists and former
supporters of the Confederacy.</TE>
<TE>   Stiles contends that, rather than a common criminal or a
"pre-political" outlaw of the type depicted by the historian Eric J.
Hobsbawm in his influential book "Bandits," James was an
ideologically committed political partisan who was bitterly opposed
to emancipation and Reconstruction. In one robbery, the gang even
wore masks modeled on those of the Ku Klux Klan. John N. Edwards, the
newspaper editor who promoted his image, was a shrewd publicist who
made James a "symbolic hero" as part of a campaign to place the state
under ex-Confederate control and return blacks to a position of
subordination.</TE>
<TE>   Even as rewards for his capture mounted, James became an active
participant in Missouri politics. During the presidential campaign of
1872, he wrote a letter to the press denouncing President Grant.
After one bank robbery, his gang shouted "Hurrah for Hildebrand!" as
they rode out of town, referring to former Confederate guerrilla Sam
Hildebrand, who was killed by a lawman not long before. Meanwhile,
Edwards published piece after piece lauding James and his gang,
including a 20-page supplement to the St. Louis Dispatch in 1873,
which glorified the Confederate guerrillas of wartime Missouri and
explained that it was the excesses of Unionists and postwar radicals
that drove James to crime.</TE>
<TE>   When James started robbing trains, Edwards tied his crimes to
widespread resentment over railroad behavior--rate discrimination,
policies that provoked labor strife and pools among rival companies
that limited fair competition. Edwards added that James and his gang
"rob from the rich and give to the poor," although, as noted above,
they did no such thing.</TE>
<TE>   It was hatred of Reconstruction that led James into his greatest
blunder, the 1876 raid on the First National Bank of Northfield,
Minn. Why travel so far from home to rob a bank? Because Adelbert
Ames, a Union general who championed the rights of the former slaves
and served as governor of Mississippi during Reconstruction, had
moved to Northfield after Democrats ousted him in the violent
election of 1875.</TE>
<TE>   Ames reportedly had deposited $75,000 in the bank; robbing it
would be payback for the alleged horrors of Reconstruction.
Ironically, Ames himself became part of a group whose gunfire pinned
the bandits inside the bank building. Three robbers were killed and
three captured. Only James and his older brother, Frank, escaped, but
not before murdering in cold blood the bookkeeper who steadfastly
refused to open the safe for them.</TE>
<TE>   After Northfield, James retired temporarily from his career as a
bandit. When he resumed it in 1880, with a series of robberies in
Tennessee and Alabama, he was no longer glorified in the Democratic
press. With ex-Confederates having won control of Missouri politics,
James had become expendable. He died in 1882, killed by Robert and
Charles Ford, two members of his gang.</TE>
<TE>   Stiles has combed a wealth of contemporary sources and imbues this
story with the drama it deserves. James himself, however, remains
something of an enigma. Intent on delineating the context of Civil
War-era Missouri, Stiles sometimes loses sight of James altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Until he developed his talent for self-promotion, moreover, James
was a man of action, not words, which poses a problem for the
biographer. His motives frequently must be inferred from events
leading to sometimes unpersuasive psychological speculations, such as
that "Bloody Bill" Anderson was an authority figure to replace the
father James had never known. Nonetheless, Stiles persuasively links
James to the legacy of slavery, the Civil War and the politics of
Reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, this is the biography of a violent criminal whose image
was promoted and actions extenuated by those who saw him as a useful
weapon against black rights and Republican rule. To his credit,
Stiles does not shy from employing stark language rarely encountered
in American historical writing. During the Civil War, he writes,
James was a member of a "death squad" that targeted Unionist
civilians and slaves. If he were alive today, Stiles adds, James
would be called a terrorist. Such language is, of course,
anachronistic. But it reminds us that the Klan and kindred groups
during Reconstruction killed more Americans than Osama bin Laden's
terrorists. At a time when it has become fashionable to attribute
terrorism and the support it engenders to some timeless
characteristic of "Islamic civilization," it is worth remembering
that our own history does not lack the mass killing of civilians or
those who make heroes of murderers.</TE>

<DH>THE LAST DAYS OF THE JERUSALEM OF LITHUANIA: Chronicles
From the Vilna Ghetto and the Camps, 1939-1944, By Herman Kruk,
Edited by Benjamin Harshav, Translated from the Yiddish by Barbara
Harshav, Yale University Press: 732 pp., $45</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN T. GROSS</AU>
<BD>Jan T. Gross is the author of "Neighbors: The
Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Real treasures, as we all know, lie buried. Herman Kruk's diary is a
case in point. This seminal document of Holocaust literature,
chronicling life in the ghetto of Vilna and in a labor camp in
Estonia, was first published in Yiddish in 1961 and has, until now,
never been published in English. Its belated publication is a
powerful addition to the literature of the Shoah.</LD>
<LD>   Vilna, the Yiddish name for the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, was
a thriving center of Jewish learning and Zionist activity. At the
start of World War II, nearly 60,000 Jews lived there. The city had
nearly 100 synagogues and six daily Jewish newspapers, as well as the
first Yiddish academic institute, known as YIVO. All of this,
however, was dismantled and destroyed when the Germans invaded the
city in 1941, and by the time Russian troops entered the city in July
1944, only a few thousand of Vilna's Jews who had been subject to
Nazi rule were still alive. Poet, diarist, librarian, Kruk did not
survive, but his words did.</LD>
<TE>   A member of the Bund, the Jewish Marxist party, Kruk lived in
Warsaw until 1939, when he fled the German army and ended up in
Vilna. He remained until the remnants of Vilna's Jews were
transported to extermination camps in Estonia. He was killed in a
mass execution Sept. 18, 1944, one day before the Soviet troops
liberated Estonian camps. A chronicler of all that he saw and
experienced, Kruk understood the importance of his work:</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors in camp Klooga often ask me</TE>
<TE>   Why do you write in such hard times?--</TE>
<TE>   Why and for whom? ...</TE>
<TE>   ... For we won't live to see it anyway.</TE>
<TE>   I know I am condemned and awaiting my turn,</TE>
<TE>   Although deep inside me burrows a hope for a miracle.</TE>
<TE>   Drunk on the pen trembling in my hand,</TE>
<TE>   I record everything for future generations ....</TE>
<TE>   Kruk buried the last installment of his manuscript a day before he
was killed. One of the six friends who assisted in the burial
survived and returned soon afterward to retrieve the document.</TE>
<TE>   Kruk's writing comes to light after more than half a century lost
in Soviet, YIVO and Israeli archives. YIVO had published a
significant part of it in 1961. That it was hidden from the sight of
most people interested in the subject makes the painstaking efforts
of Benjamin and Barbara Harshav all the more valuable. Even so, at
more than 700 pages, "The Last Days of the Jerusalem of Lithuania"
will leave its readers eager for the next edition, for not only was
Kruk an archivist but, in addition to keeping a diary, he collected
documents. Some of these were unfortunately lost, and it is the
inevitable frustration of this volume to read in a footnote that a
copy of a document that Kruk had attached here or there can be found
only in the YIVO's Kaczerginski-Sutzkever Collection. The subject
matter is trying, and we should not be teased so by the volume's
editors and publishers, for we are dealing here with unique testimony
about the Holocaust, and all relevant documents ought to be published
in an annex, a companion volume if need be. But this is my only
complaint, a strange one, I admit: I couldn't get enough of this
bulky masterpiece.</TE>
<TE>   As Benjamin Harshav explains in his excellent introduction, Kruk's
narrative runs in three parallel strands: The author puts together an
objective record and documents the unfolding story but also gives his
personal take on events and people and leaves for us a portrait of
the Bundist milieu in the Vilna ghetto. Even though an "outsider"--a
Warsaw Bundist in a Vilna ghetto, administered by a Jewish Council
and controlled by revisionists (that is, right-wing Zionists)--Kruk
has a privileged vantage point from which to observe and record. He
ran one of the busiest, most frequented and loved institutions in the
Vilna ghetto: the Strashun Library. People knew about his project and
were bringing him stories and material.</TE>
<TE>   What does he write about? All of ghetto life and death is there,
each daily entry divided into small, independently titled segments.
In an Israeli archive, Harshav discovered a manuscript of 100 pages,
"Kruk's own detailed table of contents ... often including ten or
twenty topics recorded in one day."</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, Segment 8 of the Oct. 29, 1942 entry (16
segments in all): "Walk to the Right in the Street--The police calls
to the attention of the general ghetto population that, regardless of
all previous warnings, people in the ghetto are not very careful
about keeping to the right when walking in the street. Because ghetto
sidewalks are very narrow, the order to stay strictly on the right is
more than justified--it is a necessity of ghetto life. In the future,
they will be stricter and will punish people for not walking on the
right side."</TE>
<TE>   And from there, in one swoop, we move to eternity. In Segment 11,
he writes: "More About Oszmiana--This evening, eight [automobiles]
with things from Oszmiana came to the district commissar of the Vilna
district .... The German drivers say 800 Jews were murdered there. A
typical case: the automobiles with clothing were unloaded by Jewish
workers. A barefoot girl spotted a pretty pair of women's shoes and
asked a German if she could take them. He told her that if she knew
where the shoes came from, she would surely not want to use them,
even if they were made of gold. So the German explained. 'Now,' the
German added, 'if you want, take them.' Of course, the woman took the
shoes."</TE>
<TE>   In virtually all Holocaust-era diaries--detailed, unique, specific
to the place and reflecting vagaries of each author's individual
destiny--one finds a common theme, a recurring line: "Whatever we may
have foreseen and written about many times," to quote from Kruk's
entry of Oct. 28, 1942, "it is all hardly a fraction of the actual
situation." One cannot grapple with the surrounding reality. The
diarists all seem to be saying that it cannot be communicated; one
cannot express it, and yet they strive precisely to do that. As a
result, what they do is like telescoping a vast and overwhelming
experience into a simple image, into a sentence, into a word
sometimes; like drawing a compact synthesis of something that
simultaneously "cannot" and "must be" conveyed and is articulated
under a powerful inner compulsion.</TE>
<TE>   A text that originates in such circumstances, I imagine, must be
written with utmost care, each word chosen deliberately and put down
like a step on a mountaintop. Isn't this, in a manner of speaking,
how poetry comes to life?</TE>
<TE>   In recalling the composition of her greatest poem, "Requiem," Anna
Akhmatova recounts the genesis of that poem. "In the fearful years of
the Yezhov terror I spent seventeen months in prison queues in
Leningrad. One day somebody 'identified' me. Beside me, in the queue,
there was a woman with blue lips. She had, of course, never heard of
me; but she suddenly came out of that trance so common to us all and
whispered in my ear (everybody spoke in whispers there): 'Can you
describe this?' And I said: 'Yes, I can.' And then something like a
shadow of a smile crossed what had once been her face."</TE>
<TE>   As a great poet knew all along, single voices can break through
leaden silence, but they too are often part of that silence. The fate
of several hundred thousand Jews murdered in the Belzec extermination
camp must be teased out from the one and only line that its victims
have left: "Mamusiu, przeciez ja bylem grzeczny ... ciemno, ciemno
...." ["But, Mommy ... but, I was well behaved ... darkness,
darkness."] It is a blind--a truly blind--fate that passed these
words on to us, but this is all we've got. In some mysterious way, it
is as if Akhmatova transposed these words while taking on that other
mustachioed mangeur d'hommes who shaped our time when she wrote in
"Requiem":</TE>
<TE>   No, it is not I, it is someone else who is suffering.</TE>
<TE>   I could not have borne it. And this thing which has happened,</TE>
<TE>   Let them cover it with black cloths,</TE>
<TE>   And take away the lanterns ...</TE>
<TE>   Night.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, quietly in the background, on the crossroads of
war-torn Europe, a great poet from Vilna, Czeslaw Milosz, kept
humming in "Rescue," his shattering volume of wartime verse, "There
will be no other end of the world; / there will be no other end of
the world" in his poem, "A Song on the End of the World."</TE>
<TE>   Holocaust memoirists have done their task: They bore witness. Now,
to make sense of our century's dark times, we must do ours: Read
their testimony as it had been conceived, as we read verse, one line
at a time.</TE>

<DH>BLESSINGS, A Novel, By Anna Quindlen, Random House: 230
pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A teenager drives his girlfriend one night to a rich widow's estate
outside a small New England town. They leave a box containing a
newborn baby, which is found the next morning by the young caretaker,
Skip Cuddy. Skip, who has served time in jail and was abandoned by
his own father, isn't inclined to turn the infant girl over to what
he considers a callous foster-care system. He names her Faith and
tries to raise her himself, in secret.</LD>
<LD>   The estate is called Blessings, and it doesn't take any special
alertness to suspect that Anna Quindlen's fourth novel (after "Object
Lessons," "One True Thing" and "Black and Blue") is going to deliver
a heartwarming story. Which it does. What surprises us is that good
things happen not just to Skip and the baby but to the widow, Lydia
Blessing, who has lived on the estate for 50 years and is mummified
by the routine she has imposed to keep time and change at bay.</LD>
<LD>   Lydia's father pretended to be rich when the money was really his
wife's. Her mother was Jewish and hid this fact by posing as the
crustiest of Episcopalians. Her beloved brother, Sunny, committed
suicide. The father of Lydia's only child was an older, married man;
to avoid scandal after becoming pregnant, she married a family friend
she didn't love. Her husband was killed in World War II. Exiled to
Blessings by her mother, who knew her secret, Lydia made the place a
permanent refuge.</LD>
<TE>   Like Lydia's life, Blessings is deceptive. With its big white
house, its trout-filled pond, its woods and gardens and orchards,
it's "almost perfect, the sort of place that ... promised plenty
without pretense, ease without arrogance." But it's kept that way by
the labor of generations of workers from town, such as Skip. Lydia is
both despotic and helpless: She's constantly critical of the morning
coffee others make for her, but she doesn't know how to grind the
beans herself.</TE>
<TE>   Skip, who lives in a little apartment over the Blessings garage,
buys diapers and formula and child-care books. He works outdoors
hunched over, the baby riding in a sling on his chest. Inevitably,
though, Lydia finds out about Faith--and then accepts her presence
and his surrogate fatherhood, which nothing we have seen of the old
woman so far has suggested she'd do.</TE>
<TE>   Quindlen's method is to tell the contemporary story, the story of
Skip and the baby, a bit at a time--spacing it among long
descriptions of the estate and of Lydia's memories, which seem as
vivid as what's happening to her now but arrive out of sequence. This
makes for a slow read until the sequence is apparent--until we
understand how Lydia got to be the way she is and why, at 80, she
might be willing and able to change.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to believe that someone would just abandon an
infant in the middle of nowhere like that," Lydia tells Skip sternly,
even as she recalls her mother's voice a half-century ago advising
her that Blessings "is the ideal place for you to have the baby."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Foster, the daughter of Lydia's Korean housekeeper, is
sympathetic too. She, Skip and Lydia form a baby-admiring and
picnicking society, a summer-long conspiracy against the world, as
"set apart" as the estate has always been. But New England summers
are short, and we know the idyll can't last. The question is what
poses the greatest threat: the law and the biological mother? The
housekeeper, a greater despot, in her own way, than Lydia? Or the
lowlife friends who led Skip astray before he came to Blessings?</TE>
<TE>   John Cheever, in his Wapshot novels, covered some of the same
geographical and psychological territory with humor, luminous prose
and a hint of real tragedy. Quindlen, by contrast, is earnest,
detailed and comforting. She considers a question that haunts Skip
and Lydia--are we trapped forever in the cages of our upbringing and
class?--before she delivers, with the aid of a dead man's
bloodstained suit and an attic full of treasure, on the promise of
her title, however mixed those blessings may be.</TE>

<DH>LIFE ITSELF! By Elaine Dundy, Virago/Trafalgar Square: 388
pp., $14.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAVIN LAMBERT</AU>
<BD>Gavin Lambert is the author of several books, including
"Inside Daisy Clover" and "The Slide Area," "On Cukor" and "Mainly
About Lindsay Anderson."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Elaine Dundy divides her life story into four parts,
"Waiting to Be Discovered," "Being Discovered," "Discovering Myself"
and "Discovering Elsewhere," it really contains only three: life
before, with and after Kenneth Tynan, the flamboyantly gifted and
costumed British theater critic.</LD>
<LD>   Part One is the story of a bright, attractive, ambitious girl from
a well-to-do Jewish family in Brooklyn who becomes a small-part
actress, then goes to Paris in 1949 after hearing that American
actors are much in demand there. Parts Three and Four describe the
post-Tynan-alcoholic-sleeping-pill-addiction route to AA, from which
she emerges relatively intact. All this is familiar terrain with only
a few compelling features, but in the long central section of "Life
Itself!," the account of her marriage is riveting.</LD>
<LD>   By the time Dundy and Tynan discover each other in London, it's
clear that she's become a fame junkie. And her autobiography, like
Tynan's posthumously published diaries, makes it clear that he shared
her addiction. Celebrity fixes, in fact, were a powerful component of
the glue that kept them together from 1951 to 1964.</LD>
<TE>   In Part Two of "Life Itself!," Dundy throws famous names around
like confetti: Richard Burton, Peter Finch, Graham Greene, Alec
Guinness, Gene Kelly. When she bears Tynan a daughter, Cecil Beaton
and Katharine Hepburn agree to become godparents. Not coincidentally,
when Tynan in his diaries recalls the "happy times" with Dundy, he
selects the happiest as a birthday party that Richard Avedon
organized for Mike Nichols. Flown from London to New York, then--at
the time of the party--nailed inside large crates and opened as human
gifts, the couple joined a galaxy of guests including Lauren Bacall,
Leonard and Felicia Bernstein, Truman Capote and Stephen Sondheim.</TE>
<TE>   Dundy mentions too many celebrities like items in a gossip column
("Judy Garland was fat in a caftan, but talked easily and wittily"),
but sometimes she records an illuminating anecdote. "I am for
normalcy and against homosexuality," Ernest Hemingway announces to
her, "because there are infinite variations for the normal person but
none for the homosexual one." How little he knew, and how ironic that
Tynan's obsessive heterosexual desires proved traumatic for his wife.</TE>
<TE>   In Kingsley Amis' words, Tynan was "an old-fashioned British
flogger." Caning was his foreplay of choice, but Dundy, after
reluctantly consenting, felt only pain and anger at first. But from
time to time she continued to submit, partly because she loved him
(and the world he introduced her to); partly because he threatened
suicide when she threatened to leave him; and partly because the
sadist brought the masochist out of the closet, and Dundy felt "...
the thrill of an accomplice collaborating at her own ruin."</TE>
<TE>   As Tynan alternates between fascinating and humiliating her,
Dundy's reaction seesaws between "Now I can love him and now I must
hate him." When they begin to have affairs on the side, Tynan expects
Dundy to accept and even welcome his infidelities but doesn't play
fair. He recalls in his diaries that during a trip to Spain, when she
confessed to an affair with Amis, "I caned her, one stroke for each
letter of his name." Meanwhile, Kathleen Halton, his second
wife-to-be, was waiting in the south of France on "a half-promise
that I would leave Elaine and join her there."</TE>
<TE>   Later, when "everyone" gossips about Dundy's affair with a
Scottish laird, Tynan is so incensed that he beats her up and leaves
her "unconscious on the bathroom floor with two black eyes and a
broken nose." It's a relief to the reader, and surely to the writer,
when Orson Welles takes one look at Dundy's face, says, "Now will you
divorce him?" and she agrees.</TE>
<TE>   Dundy describes 14 years of a marriage that turned from heaven to
hell in vivid, horrible and absurd detail. Sometimes the couple
become as savage as August Strindberg's in "Dance of Death," and
sometimes as blackly comic as Edward Albee's central characters in
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" As well as threatening suicide when
he's on the brink of losing her, Tynan blames Dundy for making him
feel ashamed of his sexual preferences, but he never seems to
understand how they humiliate her. And yet, between canings,
confrontations and reconciliations, party-going and visits to
psychiatrists, travels to France, Spain, Italy, New York and
Hollywood, Tynan somehow manages to write the best of his theater
criticism (for the Observer in Britain, then for the New Yorker), and
Dundy completes two slight, entertaining novels.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Strindberg and Albee wives, Dundy had a romantic
streak. It encouraged two fatally mistaken and contradictory beliefs:
that her love would be powerful enough to "cure" her husband and that
a true love would come along to "take Ken off my back." It says much
for her basically amiable and generous nature that Gore Vidal and
Tennessee Williams, whom she got to know as Elaine Tynan, remained
her friends after she became Elaine Dundy again. It's also proof of
her talent for self-discovery that she could look back on her
marriage to Tynan, decide that she's "more indebted to him than
debited," yet find it "absurd that the lesser debt of gratitude, I
pay, but the greater one, of forgiveness, I defer."</TE>
<TE>   For Tynan, life after Dundy was less rewarding. In 1967, four
years after he kept her waiting in the south of France, he married
Halton. Hoping to become more than "just" a critic, he tried but
failed to raise money for a film (about sado-masochism) he'd written
and wanted to direct. He signed contracts to write several books that
he never completed, and only his piece on Louise Brooks for the New
Yorker reflected the brilliance of his best writing, nearly always
about actors. Until he died of emphysema in 1980, at age 53, his
diaries reeked with the despair of a burnout case.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Dundy discovered "Elsewhere" as well as herself, and
wrote her two most substantial books. "Elvis and Gladys," a study of
Elvis Presley's relationship with his mother, is inevitably
overshadowed today by Peter Guralnick's two-part biography, but it
contains many original insights, notably concerning Presley's boyhood
obsession with Captain Marvel Jr., the comic book hero with a dual
identity. She followed this with a biography of the Southern small
town Ferriday, La., intrigued by its claim "to have produced more
famous people per square mile than any other town in USA." (That
fatal attraction again.) In fact the Ferriday celebrity list, headed
by rock star Jerry Lee Lewis, TV anchorman Howard K. Smith,
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart and Gen. Claire Lee Chennault (who
organized the Flying Tigers), is less intriguing than Dundy's
exploration of the way Southern towns so often produce "downright
theatrical people."</TE>
<TE>   Vidal once told Tynan that "Elaine wants something you can never
give her. She wants herself." The long central episode of her
autobiography and various incidental passages (notably her comparison
of Hemingway heroes and Williams heroines) make me wish that she'd
been quicker to give herself what she wanted and become a writer
freed from the desire to write primarily to gain her husband's
approval and regain her self-esteem.</TE>
<TE>   But "Life Itself!" ends with 80-year-old Dundy watching a sunset
from her Los Angeles penthouse. "I share in its exhilaration, and am
content," she writes, so maybe she got enough of what she wanted
after all.</TE>

<TE>   Throughout our American Experience, the combat between Ken and me
had continued. Looking back it is often where our fighting took place
that I remember rather than what those rows were about. One
particular altercation, at East 89th Street in the winter of 1959,
began in the living room and rapidly accelerated to the stage where
we were looking for things to throw. When we saw that the maid was
trying to get in to clean the room, without missing a beat we moved
into the bedroom she had just finished putting in order.</TE>
<TE>   Had we a penchant for theatrics? What did you expect?</TE>

<LD>To the editor:</LD>
<LD>   Adam Kirsch is correct (Book Review, Aug. 25) when he tells your
readers that Theodor Adorno wrote a book on composing for the films
while he was in L.A. during the 1940s.</LD>
<LD>   Kirsch may be the first person in America to state this, because
the book (translated) was originally published as "Composing for the
Films" by Hanns Eisler (Oxford University Press, l947) and has
countless times been described this way--by me, among others.</LD>
<TE>   I did hear rumors, early on, that Adorno had had a hand in writing
that book. Also that he withheld his name from the first edition in
order not to be associated with Eisler, known to be a Communist. I
don't know if this last statement is true, but I do know that in
volume 15 of Adorno's collected works, now in print with the Suhrkamp
Verlag in Frankfurt, the late Adorno tells us that nine-tenths of
that book is his own work and that the late Eisler conceded as much.</TE>

<DH>THE LIVES OF THE MUSE: Nine Women and the Artists They
Inspired, By Francine Prose, HarperCollins: 420 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELLER McALPIN</AU>
<BD>Heller McAlpin writes for numerous publications,
including the San Francisco Chronicle, Newsday and the Washington
Post.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ancient Greeks had nine goddesses to explain the mystery of
inspiration, each Muse mistress of her own branch of art. When
Christianity displaced paganism, an alternate, mortal explanation for
creativity was required. In "The Lives of the Muses," Francine Prose,
many of whose novels focus on obsessive relationships, investigates
passion as a major source of artistic inspiration.</LD>
<LD>   Prose acknowledges that few artists today outside fashion houses
and dance companies have muses and observes, "We have, as a culture,
reached the point at which nearly anything--geography, ambition,
expensive tastes, an abusive childhood, poverty--seems a more
probable motivation for making art than the promptings of longing or
love." Yet she is fascinated by the complex, often obsessive dynamic
between artists and their muses. She explains, " ... since falling in
love is the closest that most people come to transcendence, to the
feeling of being inhabited by unwilled, unruly forces, passion became
the model for understanding inspiration."</LD>
<TE>   Her title, "The Lives of the Muses," echoes Samuel Johnson's "The
Lives of the Poets." Prose profiles nine women who inspired artists,
ranging from Johnson's longtime friend Hester Thrale to John Lennon's
"muse-witch," Yoko Ono. Like Phyllis Rose's portraits of five
Victorian marriages, "Parallel Lives," "The Lives of the Muses" is a
study of couples. It is a thoroughly researched, highly opinionated
series of fascinating double biographies that charts some of the
multivariate forms partnerships--and love--can take. What it doesn't
do is clarify the mystery of inspiration, even as it relates to
passion. Though Prose identifies various commonalities among her
carefully selected group, she leaves us convinced that
inspiration--like passion--is quirky, highly individualistic and
often ineffable.</TE>
<TE>   By limiting her selection to nine, Prose has made some tough
exclusions. Among the absent are Alma Mahler, Zelda Fitzgerald and
all of Picasso's mistresses. Some might quibble with her choices. It
can be argued, for example, that Kiki de Montparnasse or Juliet Man
Ray were greater influences on Man Ray than Lee Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Prose acknowledges the sexism inherent in the supportive role of
muses and wryly comments, "Certainly, feminism has made us rethink
musedom as a career choice." She briskly dismisses men as being
socially unsuited for musedom, more "psychiatric nurses like Leonard
Woolf." Yet surely women artists have been fired by passion, and men,
wittingly or not, have served as their inspiration. She mentions but
doesn't dwell on same-sex muses such as Sergei Diaghilev and Vaslav
Nijinsky, and Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. Wife-muses also get
short shrift. She cites the "downward slide from an exalted goddess
to the more human, unenviable and inglorious role of helpmate and art
wife" that Charis Weston took: from posing nude on Oceano beach to
labeling slides. "Except in extremely rare cases--Gala Dali's, for
example--tenure is not an option in the careers of the muses," she
concludes.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because, as Prose so glaringly documents--in her novels too,
including "Blue Angel"--passion is short-lived, one of the least
sustainable emotions. Also, "the power of longing is more durable
than the thrill of possession." Two of the four muses who married
their artists--Weston and Lizzie Siddal--suffered mightily. Most
tragic was Siddal, Dante Gabriel Rossetti's pre-Raphaelite stand-in
for Dante's Beatrice, who died of opium addiction. Prose is tough on
both Rossetti and Edward Weston, surprisingly critical not just of
their egoism but of their art, and she defends their muses with
somewhat anachronistic feminist indignation.</TE>
<TE>   Muses who pointedly asserted their independence by having affairs
and marrying others fared little better. Johnson repudiated Hester
Thrale when she married her daughter's Italian voice coach, and
George Balanchine banished Suzanne Farrell and Paul Mejia from his
New York City Ballet Company after they wed. In her disappointingly
leaden chapter on Lou Andreas-Salome, Prose shows how the
Russian-born "seeker of truth," who inspired first Friedrich Wilhelm
Nietzsche and then Rainer Maria Rilke, maintained the upper hand in
her relationships by refusing to settle down. Her platonic marriage
to Friedreich Carl Andreas, a linguist, left her available for
multiple attachments, including an intellectual bond with Sigmund
Freud, who called her "the great understander."</TE>
<TE>   Eros is a powerful undercurrent in the muse-artist connection, and
most of Prose's muses were sexually liberated women unfettered by
convention. Gala Dali was married to the Surrealist poet Paul Eluard
when she met Salvador Dali, the neurotic, homosexual painter with
whom she ended up having a 53-year marriage punctuated by countless
affairs on both sides. Weston, who at 19 was no sexual novice,
discovered true passion in her "high heat" relationship with
48-year-old Edward Weston. These intimations of intimacy, of course,
provide juicy reading. The biographical revelations, however, are
more compelling than Prose's attempts to link longing for the woman
in question to the artist's creative development. Many of her artists
made their name long before these muses arrived on the scene, and
continued to produce definitive work long after they departed.</TE>
<TE>   One of Prose's most compelling subjects is Farrell, who, because
of her Catholicism, the 43 years that separated them and a wily
instinct for self-preservation, refused to become Balanchine's
mistress or fifth wife. Prose's admiration for Farrell's ability not
only to inspire the brilliant choreographer but to excel as an artist
herself animates this tale. Who was whose muse here?</TE>
<TE>   Admiration also enriches Prose's chapter on the photographer
Miller, "perhaps the most heroic, inventive, and determined of the
muses." Miller, a blond American beauty, was Man Ray's apprentice,
model and lover for three years. Her lips are the beguiling red
cushions that float through the sky in Ray's "Observatory Time: The
Lovers," and her lavishly lashed eye adorns the metronome in his
"Object to Be Destroyed," both completed after she left Ray to open
her own studio in 1932.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion was Miller's bread and butter. But according to Prose, the
restless Miller flourished as a photojournalist during World War II,
documenting the Normandy invasion and the liberation of Buchenwald
for Vogue. Prose makes an ardent case for the magnificence of
Miller's war pictures but leaves one wishing for visual backup.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, Prose's visual interpretations read like satires of
critic-speak. For example, she ends hundreds of words on Lewis
Carroll's portrait of Alice Liddell with this over-the-top
assessment: "Indeed, the photo of Alice as the beggar child is a
devotional picture, a retablo commemorating a Victorian miracle. In
the depth and fervor of its barely concealed passion, it evokes
Flemish and Italian Renaissance art, those swooning saints,
Sebastian, Theresa, apparently unconscious of the eroticism of their
ecstatic postures."</TE>
<TE>   Animosity can be as much a driving force as passion, and it is the
spark that ignites Prose's last profile. Few muses have been as
vilified as Yoko Ono, blamed for the breakup of the Beatles and the
dilution of John Lennon's talent. Prose is deliciously vicious about
Ono's influence on Lennon's last albums. In her view, even Ono's
autonomy as an artist can't redeem her sorry performance as a muse
because Ono's art is "annoying" and "irritating" art, which she
hastens to add is not the same as disquieting or discomforting.
"Daily life provides enough friction without seeking more in high
culture," she comments on Ono's "Cough Piece."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout "Muses," many of Prose's bolder assertions are flagged
by the word "if." We're prepared, therefore, for a resounding
conclusion when she climaxes her Ono attack: "If, as Kafka suggested,
art is an ax with which to break up the frozen sea within us, Ono's
art suggests that the water is colder than we'd thought." Prose's
stimulating study has a welcome warming effect.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Lives of the Muses'</TE>
<TE>   The desire to explain the mystery of inspiration, to determine who
or what is the 'moving cause' of art, resembles the impulse to find
out a magician's secrets. It's a childish, suspect desire; we fear
the truth will spoil the fun. Doesn't the mystery add to our delight?
Still, it's human nature to want to see through the sides of the box
in which the magician's assistant is being sawed in half, or into the
mind of the poet at the instant when the sonnet appears in all its
neonatal glory.... To create anything is to undergo the humbling and
strange experience--like a mystical visitation or spirit
possession--of making something and not knowing where it comes from.
It's as if the magician had no idea how the rabbit got into his hat.</TE>

<HD>Can Evil Ever Truly Be Understood?</HD>
<DH>HOLOCAUST: A History, By Deborah Dwork and Robert Jan van
Pelt, W.W. Norton: 444 pp., $27.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN K. ROTH</AU>
<BD>John K. Roth, professor of philosophy at Claremont
McKenna College, is the author of "Holocaust Politics" and co-editor
of "Remembering for the Future: The Holocaust in an Age of Genocide."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As "Holocaust: A History" draws to its close, Deborah Dwork and
Robert Jan van Pelt include a 1941 photograph of Mirka Grossman and a
fragment of conversation between the little girl and her father.
"Daddy," she asked in Polish, "isn't it better that today it's a bad
day, but tomorrow it will be better?" "Today doesn't matter," her
reassuring father replied, "tomorrow will be much better."</LD>
<LD>   It was a comment overheard by Mirka's aunt, Sara Grossman-Weil,
one August day in 1944 as cattle cars packed with Jewish deportees
from the Lodz ghetto rolled to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where more than a
million Jews perished, most of them gassed to death. Grossman-Weil
was among the few adults selected for labor, but 5-year-olds, such as
Mirka, were worse than useless to the Germans who practiced the
lethal anti-Semitism that Hitler preached. Those killers ensured that
"tomorrow" would prove her father wrong.</LD>
<TE>   Writing with a distinctive blend of moral intensity, attention to
detail and multifaceted breadth, veteran scholars Dwork and van Pelt
describe the Holocaust's history as "a story of utter perdition and
ruin." In 1944, for example, with the war against them, the Germans
operated four crematories at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Those structures
included eight gas chambers, 46 ovens and the capacity to dispose of
4,416 corpses a day. In the months before those installations and
their more primitive counterparts at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka
became operational in 1942, hundreds of thousands of Eastern European
Jews were shot to death by special task forces (Einsatzgruppen),
which were augmented by battalions of German police and supported by
the German army. Just to mention that such things happened is ruinous
enough, but the Holocaust's toll cannot be calculated by those
devastating measures alone. Thus, Dwork and van Pelt write their
history in a style that keeps individuals such as Mirka Grossman in
view.</TE>
<TE>   Scholarship's strategies always have strengths and weaknesses. In
addition to their focus on detail, Dwork and van Pelt strive for a
comprehensive overview, but their book sheds relatively little light
on how to sift and sort the controversies that interpretations of the
Holocaust unavoidably produce. Instead the authors' straightforward
method is to try to tell, as accurately as possible, what took place.
That task, however, is anything but straightforward because it raises
daunting questions to which scholars have responded in various and
often conflicting ways: Where to begin? What to emphasize or leave
out? How strongly to claim that one's account explains what took
place? Where to end, and what, if anything, to conclude from the
history one writes?</TE>
<TE>   Arguably, no one book can be a history of the Holocaust. The
Holocaust entails a multiplicity of accounts, including those of 6
million Jews, among them more than a million murdered Jewish children
such as Mirka Grossman. Each account differs in detail because every
man, woman and child perished one by one, just as every killer,
bystander or rescuer was an individual with all the complex
relationships and circumstances that such identity entails. The
Holocaust is so vast that, at best, there can be only selective
historical narratives about it. Done well, they more or less weave
together reliable glimpses, documented perspectives, focused but not
all-embracing slices from a destruction process that swept through a
continent from 1933 to 1945. This melancholy work is done not to
achieve an unattainable mastery but, as the historian Raul Hilberg
says, "lest all be relinquished and forgotten." The destruction
process, moreover, does not account for itself but can be grasped
only in relation to the conditions--some of them centuries old--that
made it possible. Still further, the Holocaust reverberates far
beyond 1945, leaving one to wrestle with its never-ending
implications. Given these limitations and dilemmas, how do Dwork and
van Pelt convert a virtually impossible task, the attempt to write a
one-volume history of the Holocaust, into a noteworthy achievement?</TE>
<TE>   Although this part of their book is underdeveloped, Dwork and van
Pelt understand that the history of the Holocaust begins at least as
far back as the struggles that attended the emergence of
Christianity, the religion that grew from Jewish roots nearly 2,000
years ago and soon defined itself in opposition to its sibling rival.
Absent that rivalry in a Western culture that became predominantly
Christian, it is not possible to explain why Jews became targeted for
the multiple forms of anti-Semitism--political and especially
racial--that ultimately produced an unprecedented genocide.</TE>
<TE>   In greater detail, Dwork and van Pelt supply essential background
by concentrating on two other crucial moments in European history
prior to Hitler's coming to power in late January 1933. First, with
the Enlightenment and the emancipation of the Jews that gradually
developed in Europe after the French Revolution, the idea of the
nation-state and its citizens emerged in full cry. Emancipated Jews
would have to be assimilated Jews, but even if they tried to be the
latter, suspicion that they were the "other" still dogged them. The
danger in that fate escalated during the 19th century, when, as Dwork
and van Pelt point out, nationalism increasingly identified " 'the
nation' and 'the people' with biological, genetic descent." Second,
the carnage of World War I, which included the Armenian genocide,
turned Germany into a fertile field for Hitler's ideology. An
incalculable price would be paid for that arrogant vision of German
superiority, territorial expansion and the elimination of Jews and
other so-called racial inferiors.</TE>
<TE>   Dwork and van Pelt emphasize that neither Hitler's rise to power
nor the Holocaust was inevitable. "No straight line," they correctly
say, "led to the gas chambers of Birkenau." Nevertheless, Hitler took
the German people--more by consent than coercion--down a lethally
consistent path. He spoke repeatedly about getting rid of the Jews,
and, the authors stress, he meant what he said. If his racist brand
of anti-Semitism entailed "social death" and forced emigration before
Nazi Germany ignited World War II by invading Poland in September
1939, then once the Nazi blitzkrieg brought millions of additional
Jews under German domination, the policy evolved into systematic
murder on a massive and unrelenting scale.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring a pivotal point, Dwork and van Pelt show that these
developments took place not because Hitler always gave explicit
orders but because his principal followers--relatively young men,
with Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich chief among them--eagerly
vied for favor and power by "working towards" Hitler, by "taking
independent initiatives to promote what they surmised the Fuhrer's
wishes to be, even to anticipate them." The ensuing struggles doomed
Europe's Jews. The authors give voice to these people, who were
impoverished, unable to find refuge and largely defenseless. The
European Jews tried valiantly to sustain their families and
traditions, but the odds were overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   Within this matrix Dwork and van Pelt locate "the paradoxical
developments" that they hope their book untangles. Those developments
have at least three dimensions. First, the Holocaust took place in a
predominantly Christian culture; that culture could have led those
who killed and those who stood by to act differently, to embrace
Mirka Grossman as a fellow human being whose life must be protected
and saved. There were people who rescued Jews, but unfortunately they
were too few and far between, for central aspects of the Christian
tradition were anti-Jewish and minimized moral obligations toward
Jews. Second, the Enlightenment's optimistic political philosophies
envisioned nations with citizens who shared equal rights. Such an
outlook could have fostered inclusion, but the idea of "one nation,
indivisible" developed in ways that promoted exclusion instead.
Third, it was not an ignorant rabble but an educated elite,
well-versed in the technology and science of its day, who dedicated
themselves unquestioningly to Nazi ambition. Its endemic violence,
they somehow believed, would lead to heights transcending humanity
itself.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no silver lining to the Holocaust," conclude Dwork and
van Pelt. That judgment extends to their book as well. Even though
the authors help to show why so much went wrong, their history cannot
untangle completely the paradoxes it insightfully identifies. Doing
so would require closure that the Holocaust can never give us. After
the last page is turned, the most telling questions remain. Dwork and
Van Pelt say that one of them ought to be "What, in light of the
Holocaust, is the definition of the word 'civilization'? "</TE>
<TE>   In 1921, 20 years before the worst of the Holocaust raged, the
philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein suggested that "what we cannot speak
about we must pass over in silence." Dwork and van Pelt show that we
can and must speak about the Holocaust, but in the aftermath of that
event, optimistic talk about "civilization" is anachronistic or
premature. Unless that word is redeemed by deeds of caring and
justice, especially by acts akin to those who rescued Jews during the
Holocaust, silence about civilization's grandeur can only be broken
with mournful irony.</TE>

<DH>ROBERT IRWIN GETTY GARDEN, By Lawrence Weschler,
Photographs by Becky Cohen, Getty Publications: 174 pp., $45</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WITOLD RYBCZYNSKI</AU>
<BD>Witold Rybczynski is the author of many books,
including "The Perfect House: A Journey with the Renaissance
Architect Andrea Palladio." He teaches at the University of
Pennsylvania.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I first heard that Robert Irwin had been commissioned to lay out
the central garden at the Getty Center, I inwardly groaned. I
imagined one of those cheerless, concrete constructions that
characterize so much cutting-edge landscape architecture today.
Landscape architects, casting an envious eye on architects, now want
us to appreciate their work as art. But modern art, as everyone
knows, reflects the angst and distress of modern life, which is hard
to do with bougainvillea. Hence we have gardens without prettiness or
charm, that is, not much of gardens at all.</LD>
<LD>   I hope that Irwin does not take it amiss if I report that whatever
else it is, the Getty garden appears to be pretty and charming.
Irwin, sometimes called an environmental artist, is one of the
founders of California's light and space movement, and although he is
known for site installations, he is definitely not a landscape
architect. That may be why he didn't avoid using traditional garden
elements--benches, arbors, paths, a stream, rocks, bridges. And a
veritable riot of flowers. There hasn't been an artist's garden this
colorful since Monet's Giverny.</LD>
<TE>   "Robert Irwin Getty Garden" is the work of three people: Lawrence
Weschler, a longtime staff writer at the New Yorker and an Irwin
biographer; Irwin himself, whose extended conversation with Weschler
forms the main body of the book; and Becky Cohen, whose exquisite
photographs made me, who has not seen the garden, feel I was there.
The conversation between Irwin and Weschler takes place during
several consecutive walks through the garden, so what we get is a
comprehensive tour: Irwin talks in detail about how the various parts
were created, explaining what he was trying to achieve, practically
and aesthetically; Weschler asks questions and generally pushes
things along; and Cohen's accompanying photographs show us what the
pair are talking about. It is a simple organizing concept, and it
works beautifully.</TE>
<TE>   The bright colors of the Getty garden are in sharp contrast to
Richard Meier's monochrome architecture, but the relationship between
the garden and the buildings is a complicated one. Irwin's
geometrical plan, for example, is clearly meant to complement the
architecture. Some of his fussy details--the bronze handrails, the
teak benches, the limestone path--appear to be a sympathetic response
to Meier's obsessive attention to detail. At the same time, the
garden is very much Irwin's creation and stands apart from the
assertive architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Understandably, relations between the artist and the architect
became strained during the project. Irwin is not an architectural
critic, but he has a good eye. Observing that Meier used travertine
as well as his signature white metal panels, he points out: "Instead
of really, say, maybe taking on the challenge and going away from his
most familiar material and expanding his aesthetic: he didn't do
that, he passed up the opportunity." Which is a good summation of the
reason for the Getty's rather limited architectural success.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin describes his own work at the Getty as "a sculpture in the
form of a garden aspiring to be art." This is not landscape
architecture in the conventional sense. It does not easily fit either
of the two main historical garden traditions: British picturesqueness
and French formality (although Irwin manages to include a bit of
both). Yet his approach at the Getty puts me in mind of Frederick Law
Olmsted, the great 19th century park builder. Like Olmsted, Irwin is
not a plants man; what interests him is the visual effect of
planting. Like Olmsted, he is concerned with orchestrating the entire
garden experience: the sound of burbling water, the textures of
boulders, the dappled shadows cast by trees. Like Olmsted, he is not
above resorting to contrivances to enhance natural effects. And like
Olmsted, Irwin always places us--not himself or his design--at the
center of things.</TE>

<LD>Recent rants concerning the pay packages for top executives are
warranted and long overdue ["Conference Board Panel Calls for Cuts in
Executives' Pay," Sept. 18]. However, during the second half of the
1990s, when the number of mutual funds--and the money flowing into
them--grew exponentially, a new cadre of young, relatively
inexperienced MBAs became fund managers and investment bankers.</LD>
<LD>   With Wall Street hype in high gear from every news outlet in the
land, the rise in the stock market seemed to have no end in sight.
And these young fund managers and investment bankers, many in their
late 20s or early 30s, could make millions of dollars simply by
supporting this house of cards.</LD>
<LD>   With the nation suffering devastating losses in the stock market,
I must suggest we were grossly overcharged for the management of our
mutual fund accounts. And , while millions of Americans reconsider
their retirement plans in the wake of those losses, one must assume
that these overpaid zealots of the system could retire quite
comfortably at age 30, thanks to the millions they were paid at the
expense of investors.</LD>
<TE>   So go ahead and take issue with the compensation excesses of top
executives. But there is another greedy group in the Wall Street
system that has yet been exposed for its own excesses.</TE>

<TE>   Inquiries Can Ease Angst Over Online Diplomas</TE>
<TE>   I was pleased to see the article on diploma mills and warnings
offered to individuals considering such degrees ["Diploma Mills Use
Reach of Internet," Sept. 8]. There are reputable distance learning
programs. To protect consumers who are unsure about the legitimacy of
such schools, they should inquire about whether the institution has
Distance Education and Training Council accreditation. For more than
75 years, the DETC has been the standard-setting agency for
correspondence study and distance education institutions.</TE>
<TE>   The independent accrediting commission of the DETC (formerly the
National Home Study Council) is listed by the Department of Education
as a "nationally recognized accrediting agency." The commission also
is a recognized member of the Council for Higher Education. The Web
site is www.detc.org.</TE>

<TE>   If they would make more movies that do not have the "f" word, raw

<TE>   Pay for Lack of Quality</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem with the domestic car industry is not pensions
or efficiencies ["Serious Woes for U.S. Auto Makers," James Flanigan,
Sept. 15]. It is that they do not make cars that buyers believe are
worthy of the price tag.</TE>
<TE>   The perception that the quality of domestic products is inferior
to foreign affects buyers' decisions naturally. Unless domestic
manufacturers erase--by fact--that premise, they will have to cut
prices to sell their cars.</TE>

<TE>   In our desire to find the best deal, so we believe, we have

to show our patriotism after 9/11? If the U.S. auto industry goes the
way of the steel industry, we have no one to blame but ourselves. We
don't care what happens to our fellow Americans as long as our little
piece of existence is smooth and we feel good.</TE>

<HD>Fears on Economy Rack Wall Street</HD>
<DH>Stock market's slump raises concerns about a 'double dip'
recession and whether the Fed needs to act.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street long ago mastered the glass-is-half-empty side of the
debate over the economy. Even in the best of times, the stock market
is supposed to be worried.</LD>
<LD>   In those rare periods when investors lose all fear of the
future--as at the peak of the Internet mania--stocks can become
ridiculously overvalued. And when fear becomes all-consuming, the
market usually is a bargain basement.</LD>
<LD>   But gauging whether investors today are too worried about the
economic fundamentals or not worried enough is as tough a call as
ever. It's a call that Federal Reserve policymakers will have to make
Tuesday when they gather to decide whether to take any action on
interest rates.</LD>
<TE>   The Fed can't be happy to see major stock indexes tumbling back
toward the multiyear lows they hit in midsummer.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index on Thursday closed less than 1% above
its five-year low, reached on Aug. 5. It rallied slightly Friday,
adding 4.64 points to 1,221.09, but fell 5.4% for the week and is
down 14% since Aug. 22.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrials also eked out a small gain Friday to
close at 7,986.02, but lost 3.9% for the week and have surrendered
most of the advance they made in late July and early August. A drop
below 7,702, the four-year low reached July 23, would suggest that
the bear market still hasn't run its course, after more than 30
months.</TE>
<TE>   The picture is even grimmer in Europe, where major stock indexes
last week plummeted to fresh five-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   And in Japan, the stock market was able to mount a midweek rally
only after the Bank of Japan said it was considering becoming the
buyer of last resort for troubled banks that need to unload depressed
share holdings. At 9,481.08 on Friday, the Nikkei-225 index remains
less than 5% above the 19-year low it hit Sept. 4.</TE>
<TE>   For the Fed and other central banks, the question is whether the
latest swoon in share prices is foreshadowing a slide back into
recession--the dreaded "double dip."</TE>
<TE>   Many economists say that if that's what equity markets are worried
about, they're overdoing it. At worst, the economic picture is mixed,
they say.</TE>
<TE>   Government data last week showed that in August U.S. housing
starts dipped for a third month and industrial production fell for
the first time this year.</TE>
<TE>   But the National Assn. of Home Builders said its index of builder
optimism rebounded this month to a two-year high, as mortgage rates
have continued to decline and as buyer traffic has picked up.</TE>
<TE>   Also, despite severely bearish news on corporate capital spending
last week from computer services giant Electronic Data Systems--whose
shares lost 53% of their value Thursday, after the company forecast a
big shortfall in quarterly earnings--some analysts maintain that the
corporate spending picture isn't disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   Economists warn against making an assumption that because so much
of the nation's industrial capacity sits unused, companies don't need
to make capital outlays.</TE>
<TE>   The overall capacity utilization rate was 76% in August, down from
a peak of more than 82% in 2000, before the recession.</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Rippe, economist at Prudential Financial in New York,
notes that "the question of 'Do I need more capacity?' is one
decision. There's also the [issue that] things wear out," including
factory equipment, computer systems, etc.</TE>
<TE>   "The capital spending outlook is not as bad as advertised," said
Sung Won Sohn, economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "Excluding structures, a lagging indicator, expenditures on
equipment and software bottomed during the first quarter of this
year," Sohn said. "Outside of the aircraft and telecom sectors,
equipment spending looks much healthier."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Earnings Outlook</TE>
<TE>   To sustain spending, however, companies need decent earnings
growth. And the near-term outlook for earnings may be as big a
concern as any on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, third-quarter profit warnings from McDonald's Corp.,
J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Oracle Corp., along with EDS' shocker,
helped push more investors into the bearish camp.</TE>
<TE>   So far this quarter, 457 companies have warned that earnings in
the period will be lower than expected, according to data tracker
Thomson First Call in Boston. That is up sharply from the 354
companies that had issued warnings at this point in the second
quarter and the 359 that had warned at this point in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The jump in the number of companies expecting shortfalls has
unnerved investors because many believed the trend was going in the
other direction--that is, an improving bottom line to match an
improving economy.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street analysts still expect earnings for the biggest
companies, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 firms, to rise this quarter from
a year ago. S&amp;P operating earnings (results excluding one-time gains
or losses) will be up 8.5% in the quarter, after a 1.4% gain in the
second quarter, according to analysts' average estimates as tracked
by Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates for the fourth quarter peg the year-over-year growth
rate at 21.3%. Many market pros believe that is far too optimistic,
but if the trend in earnings just remains up, it may be enough to
satisfy investors who believe this is a smarter time to be moving
into stocks than out of them.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the market's price level relative to earnings continues to
trouble some potential buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on whose numbers are used, the S&amp;P 500's
price-to-operating-earnings ratio based on estimated earnings for
2002 is 15 to 18. That is well below the 25-plus P/Es of the last
years of the bull market, but still well above the historical average
of about 13.5, and considerably above the P/Es that are typical at
bear-market bottoms.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the use of operating earnings understandably gives
some investors pause because of the sense that many companies have
made "one-time" charges a permanent fixture in their accounting.
Likewise, more investors may prefer to rely on actual historical
results instead of analysts' estimates of what might happen.</TE>
<TE>   Based on net income over the last four quarters--that is, results
including all write-offs--the S&amp;P 500's P/E is about 33, according to
brokerage firm Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman's chief investment strategist, Jeffrey Applegate, argues
that stocks must be judged relative to the alternatives, particularly
"cash" accounts and long-term Treasury bonds. And against those
alternatives he considers stocks "very undervalued," given the poor
yields on Treasuries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turning to Treasuries</TE>
<TE>   Money again poured into Treasury bonds last week, driving yields
to fresh 40-year lows. The 10-year T-note ended the week at 3.78%,
down from 3.91% a week earlier and 4.46% on July 31.</TE>
<TE>   But the continuing plunge in Treasury yields, while theoretically
making stocks' long-term prospects more alluring, also is adding to
concerns about the economy. Are investors so eager to get Treasuries
at any price because they're fearful that another recession is
inevitable soon, with an accompanying further collapse in stock
values?</TE>
<TE>   Or is the Treasury market pricing in some kind of financial-system
shocker that also could have dangerous implications for the economy?
Those concerns were magnified last week, when mortgage titan Fannie
Mae warned of an imbalance in its assets and liabilities because so
many homeowners are refinancing loans. Fannie Mae's shares fell 11%
for the week, even as the company insisted its imbalance can be
easily fixed.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, nerves were jangled again as the Japanese government
said its auction of new 10-year bonds failed to raise as much money
as hoped, as buyers balked. Analysts called it a vote of
no-confidence in a nation deep in debt and facing economic
stagnation.</TE>
<TE>   All of this will weigh on the Fed at Tuesday's meeting. Yet most
Fed watchers expect the central bank to leave its key short-term rate
unchanged at 1.75%--sending a message to investors that the Fed
believes the glass should be viewed as half full, not half empty.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, economists at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. say the Fed must have
significant concern about the events of recent weeks, including
stocks' renewed slump.</TE>
<TE>   "Chairman [Alan] Greenspan is probably disappointed by the renewed
darkening of commentary by senior executives, which reflects the
negative surprises in profit announcements by many firms," Goldman
told clients in a note Friday. "He and his colleagues may show a
rising appreciation for how the dangers of a policy mistake are far
greater on the side of inadequate [monetary] stimulus."</TE>

<LD>PacBell, PUC at Odds Over Long-Distance Vote</LD>
<LD>   SBC Pacific Bell and state regulators were at odds over whether
the phone company won approval to offer long-distance phone service
in California.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Utilities Commission voted 4 to 1 to approve
a petition by SBC PacBell, the state's biggest local phone company,
to add long-distance service to its offerings. That paves the way for
the company to seek the blessing of the federal government and begin
offering long-distance service by Christmas.</LD>
<TE>   The PUC also voted to bar SBC PacBell from carrying long-distance
traffic within the state until it can show that to do so would not
hinder competition.</TE>
<TE>   But SBC PacBell executives believe the vote allows them to move
forward. The confusion could trigger a messy showdown involving SBC
PacBell, regulators and long-distance companies.</TE>

<TE>   Lockout Averted at West Coast Ports</TE>
<TE>   A dispute between shipping lines and the dockworkers union came
perilously close to paralyzing the ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents West Coast shipping
lines and terminal operators, had announced that it would lock out
workers in response to a series of alleged worker slowdowns at a Long
Beach terminal.</TE>
<TE>   The lockout was called off when the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union dispatched full work crews to the Stevedoring
Services of America terminal for the evening shift.</TE>
<TE>   The drama capped a week of escalating tensions between the
management group and the union, now in their fourth month of
difficult contract negotiations.</TE>

<TE>   E-Mails Confirm Ruse by Global Crossing</TE>
<TE>   Executives at Global Crossing Ltd. knew the company was masking
its sales figures at least nine months before top officers such as
Chairman Gary Winnick cashed in stock for hundreds of millions of
dollars, according to company e-mails released by a congressional
committee.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails decry the way the company rushed at the end of each
quarter to boost revenue with "junk" deals, which involved trading
capacity on fiber-optic networks with other telecommunications firms.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing said the committee released "selected" parts of
more than 60,000 pages of documents and 40,000 e-mails that the
company had turned over to the committee and the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The company said it would continue to cooperate

<TE>   Judge Puts Bail Offer on Hold for Ex-Tyco CEO</TE>
<TE>   The ex-wife of former Tyco International Ltd. Chief Executive
Dennis Kozlowski agreed to put up the $10 million in cash to secure
his $100-million bail, but a judge put her gesture on hold after
prosecutors said they would investigate whether the money is tied to
his alleged looting of the company.</TE>
<TE>   New York State Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus scheduled a
hearing for Friday to decide the issue, and Kozlowski will be
permitted to remain free until then.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski and Tyco's former chief financial officer, Mark Swartz,
were indicted by a New York grand jury on charges of enterprise
corruption and grand larceny in connection with an alleged theft of
$600 million from Tyco.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the company disclosed more details about Kozlowski's
spending. A $2,200 wastebasket and $15,000 umbrella stand were among
the purchases he allegedly made with company funds.</TE>

<TE>   Proposed Bill to Force Deadline for Digital TV</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to speed the nation's transition to digital television, key
lawmakers are circulating a draft of a bill that would render most
TVs obsolete by 2007 and require millions of Americans to spend
hundreds of dollars on new sets or special equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, which would force broadcasters to stop sending
conventional analog television signals by Dec. 31, 2006, immediately
sparked a firestorm of criticism from broadcasters and consumer
groups, who predicted that such a requirement would face substantial
opposition in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The draft, circulated by Reps. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) and
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), is intended to light a fire under
broadcasters, cable operators and equipment manufacturers to
accelerate the rollout of digital TV.</TE>

<TE>   Holiday Shopping May Be Slowest in Years</TE>
<TE>   The upcoming holiday shopping season could be the slowest in five
years, with sales increasing a scant 4% as consumers worry about war
with Iraq and the slow pace of economic recovery at home.</TE>
<TE>   The National Retail Federation predicted the November-December
sales period would post the smallest increase since 1997. Sales grew
4% that year as the nation emerged from an economic slowdown. Sales
last year grew 5.6% in November and December, even after the
terrorist attacks.</TE>

<TE>   Rosie O'Donnell Leaving Magazine</TE>
<TE>   After feuding for months with the publisher of Rosie magazine,
former talk show host Rosie O'Donnell walked away from her namesake
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   She said her editorial control was being diminished by executives,
whom she accused of smearing her reputation.</TE>
<TE>   What started as a blissful 50-50 venture between O'Donnell and the
Gruner &amp; Jahr USA Publishing unit of Bertelsmann turned nasty in
recent months.</TE>
<TE>   The December issue of Rosie will be the last one. No decision has
been made concerning the magazine's 200 employees.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grand Jury to Probe Enron Role in Crisis</TE>
<TE>   A federal grand jury has been convened in San Francisco to
investigate whether Enron Corp. and other electricity sellers
manipulated prices during the state's energy crisis, causing
blackouts and huge electricity debts for the state and its biggest
power utilities.</TE>
<TE>   The new grand jury represents a widening of the Justice
Department's investigations of Enron and the costly California
electricity debacle of 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup to Pay Record Penalty in Settlement</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup Inc. will pay a record penalty as part of a $240-million
settlement of predatory lending charges, the Federal Trade Commission
said, ending a battle with the nation's biggest bank.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup agreed to pay the FTC $215 million in consumer redress.
It also will hand over $25 million in connection with a class-action
settlement, resolving allegations that its Associates First Capital
Corp. subsidiary gouged the poor and those with spotty credit
records.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC said the $215 million was the largest consumer protection
settlement in its history. Citigroup admitted no wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minimum Wage Doesn't Cover Southland Rents</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth consecutive year, the minimum wage was insufficient
to cover the rent for adequate housing anywhere in the U.S., and
Southern California has one of the widest affordability gaps,
according to a study of 2001 statistics by the National Low Income
Housing Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington-based advocacy group for the poor found that U.S.
workers must earn at least $14.66 an hour to pay rent on a standard
two-bedroom apartment.</TE>
<TE>   California's hourly minimum wage was increased this year by 50
cents to $6.75, but that still is less than half of what renters need
to earn to afford a standard apartment in the Los Angeles region.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch Fires Two Top Executives</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. fired two senior executives for what the
company said was their refusal to cooperate with government
investigations of the downfall of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The men are two of the highest-profile brokerage executives to
lose their jobs in what has become a series of interlocking corporate
scandals on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill fired Thomas W. Davis, chief of global stock research and
one of two executives who held the title of vice chairman. The
brokerage firm also let go Schuyler Tilney, who headed Merrill's
energy industry investment banking.</TE>

<LD>MAPPING MARS</LD>
<LD>   Science, Imagination,</LD>
<LD>   and the Birth of a World</LD>
<TE>   By Oliver Morton</TE>
<TE>   Picador: 368 pp., $30</TE>
<TE>   There are "moon men" and there are "Mars men." The choice is made
early in a scientist's life, and the obsession is lifelong. "Mapping
Mars" is about the people who have spent their lives dreaming about a
future (closer than you think) in which humans build a new world on
that seemingly inhospitable planet. It is astonishing how much is
already known about Mars.</TE>
<TE>   Mars is seamless; it has no oceans, rivers or continents. There
are no mountain ranges, only solitary mountains. There are canyons
the size of continents, lava plains the size of Canada. The sky is
yellow. There is no soil, only "regolith," crushed stone. A year on
Mars is 687 Earth days. There are two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which
give off only 10% of our moon's light. Mars is smaller than Earth,
only 10% of Earth's mass.</TE>
<TE>   "Mapping Mars" describes how all this information has been
gathered and by whom. But even more fascinating is the way that
scientists, artists and science fiction writers have, by imagining,
visualizing and dreaming, already begun forming a new world. Oliver
Morton shows how the layering of available information, going back
300 years, has created an increasingly three-dimensional picture of
the world our grandchildren might visit and their grandchildren might
live on. Learning about data-gathering devices like the Viking,
Pathfinder and Observer landers is mind-expanding, but learning about
the process by which "ideas from our full and complex planet are
projected onto the rocks of that simpler, empty one" is
universe-expanding.</TE>

<TE>   A day's drive away--in Nevada and Utah and our own backyard--are
strange formations that fascinate scientists and artists alike.
Playas are lake beds in the desert, prehistoric dry lakes, some of
which are 1.8 million years old. The ground is white, and while it
can be drawn on or sculpted, any creation will wash away in a winter
storm. Artists have found this a perfect setting to contemplate ideas
of time in the desert and "the mortality of art," the "arrogance of
permanence."</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by the simple lines of artists such as Georgia O'Keeffe
and Maynard Dixon, as well as the political realities of the Nuclear
Age, groups such as Earthworks and the Center for Land Use
Interpretation, events such as the Burning Man Festival and
individuals like Michael Heizer, Richard Misrach, Jeremy Kunkel,
Richard Serra, Richard Diebenkorn and J.M.W. Turner have added their
talents to the growing oeuvre of playa art.</TE>
<TE>   William L. Fox, who has written several books about the American
Southwest, visits a number of dry lake sites, and in Fox's
descriptions, this topography feels like a brave new world, where the
work of the artists requires a pilgrimage farther than the Getty and
an imagination that is not daunted by an endless horizon.</TE>

<TE>   Lost? Found? 1936? It takes a while to get the gist of this
WPA-style chronicle of a year in the life of America, but once you
fall into its rhythm, it is a delightful, cinematic, even musical way
to understand the daily lives of Americans at a particularly
vulnerable, tottering moment in our history.</TE>
<TE>   Here are the Great Depression, the looming Holocaust, the Munich
Olympics, the Empire State Building and all the hope and promise of
the FDR years. Here are the men and women you know, dead and alive:
Dr. Ruth, Ring Lardner Jr., Oleg Cassini. Here is all the promise of
America: growing up in cold-water walk-ups and tenements in New York,
getting beaten up for being Jewish, losing your entire family and
still, somehow, making it. Here are the working-class people: the
quarry worker in Vermont, the farmers and the women who ran boarding
houses during the Depression, finding some kind of happiness, some
kind of optimism. Some learned a child's dark lessons--"I was
probably my own best company"--and lessons that would last them
forever: "to have compassion for all people in their vulnerability."</TE>
<TE>   Most, if not all, believed in the future and had plans that
sprouted amid rotting garbage and sour smells and polio and Hitler.
If more history were written this way, we'd have more eager students,
driven to the subject with a greater sense of diversity and
possibility. We all might have a finer understanding of what freedom
means.</TE>

<DH>Susan Egan takes on the title role in 'Amy's View'--and a
title role at Orange County High School of the Arts, her alma mater.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>All the world is a stage for Susan Egan these days--except perhaps
during the four hours of sleep the star of Broadway musicals has been
getting each night while juggling two demanding new roles.</LD>
<LD>   Best known as the original leading lady of "Beauty and the Beast"
and "Triumph of Love," and for her year playing Sally Bowles in
director Sam Mendes' revival of "Cabaret," Egan is now taking on a
straight drama as the title character in David Hare's "Amy's View" at
the International City Theatre in Long Beach. She also is debuting in
the first day job of her career: as the interim artistic director of
the 1,200-student Orange County High School of the Arts in Santa Ana.
Sept. 5 was the first day of school; "Amy's View" opened the
following night.</LD>
<LD>   Both endeavors find Egan, at 32, circling back to her beginnings
in show business.</LD>
<TE>   In "Amy's View," she plays opposite her old friend Carol Lawrence.
The loving but destructive mother-daughter relationship they create
on stage has gentler parallels in the family feeling between the two
actresses. They met in 1990 in a St. Louis production of "No, No,
Nanette." Since then, Lawrence, the original Maria in "West Side
Story," has been known to whip up a lasagna when she thought that
Egan was looking a bit too thin as Belle in "Beauty" or Bowles in
"Cabaret." The Center Theater at the Long Beach Performing Arts
Center, where "Amy's View" is being mounted, is where Egan saw her
first plays as a girl. She was born in Long Beach and grew up in
neighboring Seal Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Egan's job at the Orange County High School of the Arts also marks
a return. In 1988, she was part of the school's first graduating
class; from age 12, she had been mentored by the school's founder and
director, Ralph Opacic. Now Opacic is her boss, having hired her in
June when the job of artistic director came open. Both are quick to
dispel any notion that Egan, the school's best-known graduate, will
serve as a figurehead. The school has gone through a huge growth
spurt since moving from suburban Los Alamitos to downtown Santa Ana
two years ago, and Egan and Opacic say this is an important time for
fine-tuning arts programs after a hectic period of adjustment.</TE>
<TE>   Egan has set a whirlwind agenda for her yearlong commitment. She
laid it out on a recent morning for the school's 150 faculty members,
who gathered in the campus' 1922-vintage concert hall, a converted
church. Egan exudes cheerful energy, seemingly without letup, and
sometimes intensifies what she's saying with her favorite
epithet--"gosh!" She bounded on stage and faced her new colleagues,
confidently extemporizing a pep talk about her plans.</TE>
<TE>   The actress wants to forge stronger ties between the high school
and the world of professional show biz. She aims to make its 80
annual productions run more efficiently, with less last-minute stress
and confusion. She thinks teachers in the academic wing, where
students spend a full school day, and in the arts conservatory, where
they continue for additional late-afternoon instruction, can
cooperate more closely so regular classroom subjects resonate with
the music, dance, film, theater, creative writing and visual arts
programs that lure students to the competitive, by-audition-only
public charter school.</TE>
<TE>   Egan earned applause, then was off to do some cheerleading--and
critical listening--during several hours of auditions for three
performance troupes she is launching to give kids more opportunities
to learn their art and connect with audiences outside the school.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Adnoff, a seventh-grader just entering the school,
remembered at the last second to remove the rubber bands from her
braces before launching into the torch ballad "Cry Me a River." Egan
wrote "pretty soprano" on her assessment sheet, then encouraged the
talented but nervous youngster before she began her second number.
"Jump up and down, loosen up. And don't forget to smile."</TE>
<TE>   Egan wants to challenge students. When she learned that senior
Ryan Mekenian had staged his own independent production of "You're a
Good Man, Charlie Brown," she followed her instincts and installed
him as director of the high school's big spring musical. Egan loved
Mekenian's offbeat choice: his favorite show, "Parade," which is
based on the infamous 1913 Georgia murder trial of Leo Frank, a Jew
who was unjustly convicted and later lynched. The rarely produced
1998 musical ran for only two months on Broadway but won Tony awards
for composer Jason Robert Brown and book writer Alfred Uhry.</TE>
<TE>   Opacic says it is unprecedented for a student to direct a show at
the high school. "It's something nobody considered or explored, a
perfect way to bring innovation into the school," he said. "I knew
she would provide a great deal of insight and advice, but she's
willing to be hands-on, and that's spectacular."</TE>
<TE>   Egan will ride shotgun and aims to round up the original
principals of "Parade," including director Harold Prince, to advise
Mekenian by phone. She's also bringing in "Hello, Dolly!" composer
Jerry Herman for a concert and master class. It seems, she is no more
than a degree or two of separation--if that--from all of Broadway's
elite, and she aims to use those connections to benefit her students.</TE>
<TE>   Having finished her day job, Egan heads for Long Beach and a
10-hour second shift that would include both the final afternoon
rehearsal and the first evening preview performance of "Amy's View."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how she does it," frets Lawrence, her stage mom.
"You can't burn the candle at three ends, and that's what she's
doing."</TE>
<TE>   But Egan's real mom, Nancy Egan, isn't worried. Soon after her
daughter's graduation 14 years ago, she became an administrative
assistant to Opacic and is now the arts high school's admissions
officer. Her desk is right outside Susan's office.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not concerned," mom Egan says. "She can handle it."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Egan had committed to "Amy's View" long before becoming a
school administrator. She figures she can tough out two jobs for a
while. For the rest of the school year, the Los Angeles resident
plans to limit herself to parts that won't take her out of town or
consume too much time.</TE>
<TE>   A touch of fatigue, she says, might even help her on stage in
"Amy's View." Egan's character is a bright, spirited young
Englishwoman who is gradually worn down trying to make peace between
her mother, a stage diva, and her husband, a television journalist
who alienates Mom because he thinks the theater is passe.</TE>
<TE>   "They both need her full attention, and they split her apart like
a wishbone," Egan says. "I'm getting four hours of sleep a night. I
think I'll be able to manage the haggard scenes."</TE>
<TE>   Egan trained at UCLA mainly in classic theater before leaving
after her junior year to go on the road with Tommy Tune in "Bye, Bye
Birdie." After years of the grueling eight-shows-a-week routine of
Broadway and touring musicals, Egan found herself in a comparatively
cushy TV gig during 2000 and 2001, playing a Las Vegas showgirl, the
sidekick of the title character on the WB network's now-defunct
comedy series "Nikki." With her nights and weekends free, Egan
stepped up her concert performances, recorded "So Far ...," a CD of
show tunes, and honed her dramatic chops at the Blank Theatre Company
in Hollywood, where she acted in and served as co-artistic director
of a series of staged readings of new plays.</TE>
<TE>   She traces her turn toward serious drama and the serious business
of arts education partly to the Sept. 11 attacks. Friends in New York
lost loved ones; she says the tattoo of a heart and the letter "M" on
the inside of her left wrist is for a friend who is fighting in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like what 'Amy's View' says, and I really love Carol
Lawrence, and that means more to me these days," she says. "I'm
finding the values in things, and that's why I'm at this school. It's
made me more focused on what matters."</TE>

<HD>An Epic Story in Itself</HD>
<DH>As 'Lawrence of Arabia' turns 40, even the new writing
credit is worth a tale</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>A few weeks ago, "Lawrence of Arabia" was playing in a screening room
on the Sony Pictures lot in Culver City. Three men in shirt sleeves
were watching closely and listening carefully for nearly four hours,
checking details on a new 70-millimeter print of the Oscar-winning
best picture of 1962.</LD>
<LD>   "This is one of the crown jewels, if not the crown jewel, in
Columbia's library," says Grover Crisp, vice president of asset
management and film restoration at Sony Pictures, which owns
Columbia, during a break. "So it's worth it to spend the money and
make sure we get it right."</LD>
<LD>   As the afternoon wore on, Crisp--along with technicians from
Technicolor-owned CFI and theater-sound specialists DTS--discussed
the minutiae of color contrast and density, and the specifics of the
six-track sound mix. For Crisp, it was at least his eighth viewing of
the film in six weeks.</LD>
<TE>   To mark its 40th anniversary, Columbia is re-releasing "Lawrence
of Arabia" beginning Wednesday at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. A
critical and popular favorite, director David Lean's film is widely
considered to be among the greatest screen epics ever made. A sharply
etched character study of enigmatic British adventurer T.E. Lawrence
(Peter O'Toole) and his role in uniting Arab tribesmen against the
German-allied Turks during World War I, it was filmed on stunning
desert locations in Jordan, Morocco and Spain by venerated
cinematographer Freddie Young.</TE>
<TE>   The American Film Institute's controversial top-100 list ranks the
film at No. 5, and some will insist that it really belongs in the top
three (along with "Citizen Kane" and "Casablanca," above "The
Godfather" and "Gone With the Wind"). The British Film Institute
cited it as No. 3 in its own poll, behind "The Third Man" and Lean's
"Brief Encounter."</TE>
<TE>   "Lawrence" was nominated for 10 Academy Awards in 1962, and won
seven, including best picture and director, and statuettes for
cinematography, music, editing, art direction and sound. It got a new
lease on life with a widely praised 1989 restoration, in which Lean,
who died in 1991, participated.</TE>
<TE>   It is that "director's cut" that audiences will see this week,
with two exceptions: The soundtrack has been digitally remastered,
and writer Michael Wilson's name has been added to the credits. Few
will object to the sonic improvement, although purists may be
bothered by the alteration of the main-title sequence.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the Writers Guild of America ruled that
Wilson--blacklisted after his hostile-witness appearance before the
House Un-American Activities Committee in 1951--was entitled to share
writing credit with Robert Bolt, who received sole screenplay credit
initially. Wilson died in 1978, Bolt in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "Wilson created the basic structure for the film, but the dialogue
was not good," says Robert A. Harris, who produced the restoration
with the aid of Lean. After three Wilson drafts, Bolt was brought
aboard to rewrite the script. He ultimately became Lean's regular
collaborator.</TE>
<TE>   Harris acknowledges Wilson's contribution to the script but is
uncomfortable with the screen credit modification, because of Lean's
long-held position that Bolt should have sole credit. "It was
inappropriate to do it after both David Lean and Robert Bolt were
gone," he contends. "It's like sneaking it in when your parents
aren't watching." But, he adds, "it doesn't change the film. It
doesn't hurt anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson was given belated writing credit, and a posthumous Oscar,
for co-writing Lean's previous film, "The Bridge on the River Kwai."
It was also a Columbia film, and Crisp says that Wilson's name was
added to those credits for a 1992 re-release.</TE>
<TE>   The re-creation of the "Lawrence" titles was complicated. The
credits appear on the right side of the screen, while on the left
side O'Toole, as Lawrence, is shown preparing his motorcycle for what
will turn out to be his last ride.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the negative for the background shot, which is textless,"
Crisp explains. "We basically had to have this font style created by
hand, because it didn't exist. We tried to match exactly the font,
the placement, the size and everything else, and then built a new
main-title negative." Pacific Title and Arts spent two months
rebuilding the titles.</TE>
<TE>   The running time is 217 minutes, unchanged from the 1989
restoration. The various lengths of "Lawrence," and who authorized
the cuts, is a story all by itself: 222 minutes at the December 1962
London premiere; trimmed in late January 1963 to 202 minutes (by
either Lean, or producer Sam Spiegel, or both, depending on who's
telling the story); and further cut, to 187 minutes, for a 1970
re-release, making the film "virtually unintelligible," Harris says.</TE>
<TE>   In the restoration, which Variety hailed as launching a new era in
"movie archaeology," some scenes were added and others trimmed.</TE>
<TE>   For members of Lean's cast and crew, "Lawrence" remains a landmark
experience. French composer Maurice Jarre won his first Academy Award
for the music of "Lawrence."</TE>
<TE>   "I was really lucky to work with a lot of great directors," Jarre
says, "but David was my favorite. He became a really great friend."</TE>
<TE>   Spiegel, always searching for a publicity angle, wanted to hire
concert composers Aram Khachaturian and Benjamin Britten. They proved
unavailable, so he turned to Broadway composer Richard Rodgers who,
according to legend, penned a "love theme" even though there are no
love scenes in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Jarre, who had been hired to be the film's musical supervisor,
recalls first meeting Lean at a piano audition of Rodgers' themes.
Lean was annoyed by the material, so Spiegel asked Jarre to play
something of his own. "The first theme I played was the music that
became the 'Lawrence of Arabia' theme. David put his hand on my
shoulder and he said to Sam, 'This chap knows what I'm talking about.
That is exactly what I would like to have. He should do the music.' "
Jarre scored Lean's three subsequent films and won Oscars for
two--"Doctor Zhivago" and "A Passage to India."</TE>
<TE>   "Lawrence" is "the model for what we might call an intelligent
epic," says film historian Leonard Maltin. "It's a very cerebral film
but also a very visceral one. It's a film that many younger directors
would give anything to have on their resume."</TE>
<TE>   "Lawrence of Arabia" demands to be seen in a theater, he adds.
"You can revisit it on video and enjoy it, but I would hate to think
of anybody seeing it that way for the first time. It makes such
magnificent use of the medium: wide screen, Technicolor, with a
majestic soundtrack. It's intended to be larger than life."</TE>

<DH>With 'Moonlight Mile,' writer-director Brad Silberling ends
an emotional odyssey</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SORINA DIACONESCU</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a crisp morning, a middle-aged couple and a young man who appears
to be their son are on their way out of the house. Dressed in smart
dark clothes, they walk up to a boat of a car--it is the early '70s
in a provincial East Coast town--and glide to their destination to
Sly &amp; the Family Stone's funky hymn "I Want to Take You Higher." The
universe pulsates around them, warm and vibrant like a sea of
anemones.</LD>
<LD>   Kids ride their bicycles. A young couple cuddles in each other's
arms. An old man savors the ritual moment of his morning coffee. The
sun glows through a lush canopy of trees. The sky is almost
unbearably bright. It is the dance of life, but the passengers in the
car observe it listlessly. They are going to a funeral. The couple
are burying an only daughter; the young man with them is her fiance.</LD>
<LD>   This series of tableaux from the opening of "Moonlight Mile"--a
new picture starring Dustin Hoffman, Susan Sarandon and Jake
Gyllenhaal--is emblematic of the bittersweet tenor and unorthodox
themes of the film, itself the culmination of an artistic and
personal crucible for filmmaker Brad Silberling. "I knew I wanted the
family on the journey from their home to the funeral to have to bear
witness to the full swirl of life: It just churns on, it doesn't stop
for you," he says of the unusual overture to what he calls his
"emotionally autobiographic" film.</LD>
<TE>   "Moonlight Mile" sprouted from a bitter kernel of personal
history--the 1989 murder of Silberling's girlfriend, actress Rebecca
Schaeffer. But the end result, a picture that details with unfettered
specificity the process of loss and grieving, suggests that even the
darkest of tragedies can yield remarkable gifts.</TE>
<TE>   The film is named after a vintage Rolling Stones love ditty tucked
on the group's "Sticky Fingers" album, and shares with the song a
tone that is both weary and hopeful. It tells the journey of
Gyllenhaal's protagonist who, after the funeral, finds himself
stunned into paralysis by the loss and completely bewildered about
his future. Drawn into a close relationship with the parents of his
fiancee, he fumbles toward emotional clarity--and maturity--with them
by his side.</TE>
<TE>   It may seem unlikely, yet it all happened more than a decade ago
to Silberling, 39, who wrote and directed the movie. In his treatment
of a delicate topic, the filmmaker displays a boldness and directness
that can only be grounded in firsthand experiences. His story seeks
to reveal the sense of utter befuddlement people experience after a
great loss. His characters, most remarkably the couple embodied by
Sarandon and Hoffman, exist in a perilous space filled with messy,
ragged emotions and unexpected complications. They behave awkwardly;
they say contradictory things; they use malicious wit and outbursts
of laughter as coping mechanisms.</TE>
<TE>   Opening in limited release on Friday, the film lands on screens in
the context of a nation freshly stirred by the anniversary of Sept.
11, and seems poised to achieve a larger resonance at a time when the
random loss of a loved one is a concept vigorously alive in the
collective consciousness. But in all likelihood, audiences will
either empathize with the sorrows of the protagonists or be turned
off by them.</TE>
<TE>   After all, profound grief is deeply isolating, and in many ways
those not immersed in it can't relate.</TE>
<TE>   "When you lose someone, I think there is an expectation that the
whole world would stop," explains Gyllenhaal, the 21-year-old actor
who plays Silberling's fictional alter ego, Joe Nast, with wonderful
aplomb.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the rhythms of life continue on unaltered, and it is only
the bereaved who are suddenly off-key; to them the universe appears
slightly askew. With "Moonlight Mile," says Gyllenhaal, "someone
who's experienced that has put it on screen."</TE>
<TE>   The film has been more than a decade in the making, although it
began as a family tragedy, not a career project. In 1989, Silberling,
who grew up in Los Angeles, was just out of film school and had
embarked on a promising career directing television dramas.
Schaeffer, his girlfriend at the time, was the star of the TV sitcom
"My Sister Sam." In July of that year, she was followed to her Los
Angeles home by a deranged fan who had obtained her address from the
Department of Motor Vehicles. He shot her to death.</TE>
<TE>   Silberling, then in his mid-20s, says he was stunned by the loss.
Equally perplexed were his girlfriend's parents, a couple in their
40s who had lost their only daughter. The two parties hardly knew
each other but soon grew unexpectedly close. "We had a relationship
that went from zero to 60 on the speedometer," the filmmaker recalls.</TE>
<TE>   He recognized in the parents the woman he lost. "They were like my
girlfriend in stereo--all the personality and the wit, all was
there." But what he initially thought would be a continuing
relationship with her turned into a close-knit bond with her family.</TE>
<TE>   The trio clung together in a strange new formation--just as the
fictional Floss clan from "Moonlight Mile" embrace Joe in their midst
and grow ever more reluctant to let him go. He continues to sleep in
the young woman's bedroom for weeks after the funeral.</TE>
<TE>   He becomes part of the family, is even drawn into a business
partnership with the man who would have been his father-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   On screen as in real life, what strengthened the bond was the fact
that to the community, they were all suddenly typecast--they became,
collectively, the bereaved. With that, "there's this new set of weird
expectations put upon you," Silberling says. The masks of
bereavement--piety, sadness, resignation--are to be worn at all times
in public. It is no wonder that the family thrust in this position
cannot wait to slip out of view.</TE>
<TE>   In the film, the Flosses slam the door shut behind their visitors
in relief, only to gossip ferociously about everyone afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what it's like--it's crazy," Silberling says. He did not
move in with his girlfriend's family but spent a significant amount
of time with them, and remembers that despite the shared company,
there was little solace for anyone involved.</TE>
<TE>   To keep occupied--"in the wake of a loss, you do anything you can
to stay busy"--he threw himself into lobbying efforts. He argued in
front of the state legislature for a privacy law to thwart stalking
of public figures. (The statute was passed in California first, and
later became the basis for the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, which
Congress passed in 1994.)</TE>
<TE>   The killer's trial came and went, and although it resulted in a
life sentence without possibility of parole--Marcia Clark was the
prosecutor--it also failed to provide the much-sought emotional
relief.</TE>
<TE>   "The moment I heard the judgment, it was a kick in the stomach,"
Silberling remembers. "We'd been waiting for the clouds to part. We
thought we'd feel great and skip out to lunch--and it was just the
opposite. I discovered that it's a fantasy that you will get any
closure from it--there really is none."</TE>
<TE>   It was around that time that the filmmaker began considering
channeling his experience into a film project. He completed a
screenplay in 1993. Rather than excruciating, the script was "hugely
pleasurable to write," Silberling says now. "I knew the story that I
was telling was heading toward something unbelievably beautiful and
positive." The script slept in drawers for a long time, as studio
heads balked at its complex emotional underpinnings. Completing it
however, marked a new chapter in Silberling's life. He met
someone--actress Amy Brenneman--with whom he felt he could fall in
love again. She later became his wife.</TE>
<TE>   His professional career took off. On the strength of an episode of
the TV show "Brooklyn Bridge" Silberling directed, Steven Spielberg
tapped him to make "Casper," the big-screen rendition of a popular
comic book and TV series about a teenage ghost. He next found himself
in the position to direct "City of Angels," a Hollywood retelling of
Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire." The film was a parable woven around
the conceit that angels observe with muted wonder--and envy--the
ability of humans to weep, make love or savor a cup of coffee.</TE>
<TE>   Silberling says that he unconsciously gravitates toward stories
that involve the possibility of another dimension: "I love a chance
to really examine the wonderful minutiae of life. And sometimes you
almost have to have an out-of-body experience to look back at your
body.</TE>
<TE>   "Stories that allow you to hop out of a daily routine to then
refocus on the small details of our daily routines--these are those
stories I love to tell. I wish I had the wisdom to say that it's
always conscious," says the filmmaker, whose production company is
called Reveal Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   As he watched his first two movies rake in almost half a billion
dollars at the box office, Silberling knew the time was ripe for him
to tackle his personal project. "At the time I thought, 'If I had
earned the right to anything, I had earned the right to put my purest
sensibility up on the screen.' " In 1998, he completed a new draft of
the screenplay, and set on a path that lasted almost three years and
took him to three studios.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere he went, an initial flurry of excitement about the
screenplay would inevitably be tempered by fears that the project
would be a marketing nightmare. The OK finally came in the fall of
2000 from Disney and shooting for the film was underway by the
following spring.</TE>
<TE>   As Silberling's long-cherished project has come to fruition, the
hurt and loss may have been forged into art. Alas, there was still no
moment of catharsis along the way. To this day, detailing the steps
of the journey that enabled him to translate raw life experience into
film gives him the odd pang of emotion, makes his eyes grow blurry
with tears for a moment or two.</TE>
<TE>   In "Moonlight Mile," the narrative brushes up against the edges of
a raw emotional zone in which people find themselves after
experiencing a devastating blow. It is a mined territory where
attempts to tactfully dance around the tragedy infuriate just as much
as sincere condolences.</TE>
<TE>   In the same breath, Sarandon's JoJo Floss bristles at
acquaintances who offer kind words about her daughter and complains
about those who don't: "It pisses me off when they ask about her, and
it pisses me off when they don't ask about her!" There is the
laughter behind closed doors when the unlikely trio of parents and
fiance mock the pious reverence of departed guests, and rant in
exasperation about the "dripping looks of sympathy" affected by them.</TE>
<TE>   Because the emotional underpinnings of the film are
autobiographical, Silberling says he felt confident to put on screen
behavior that may appear shocking to audiences. "You can't imagine
that others would grieve this way--yeah, they do," he insists.
"People are out of their minds sometimes. But in the wake of the
loss, the rule book goes out the window."</TE>
<TE>   His real experiences surrounding the death of his girlfriend
included not only heartbreak, but also some absurdly humorous
episodes. Some are on the screen: The fiancee's girlfriends divvy up
her duds like a flock of vultures feasting on fresh prey. Much to his
disbelief, Joe is hurriedly set up on a date with another woman.
("That happened to me two months after my girlfriend was killed, and
I couldn't believe it," Silberling says.) JoJo Floss tosses gift
books with titles like "Grieving for Grown-ups" and "The Sweeter
Solace" into the fireplace with enormous relish--a kind of wish
fulfillment for the director. He dreamed about doing the same thing
in real life when everybody from friends to the family rabbi was
handing him similar self-help manuals on how to will grief away. "I
began to have a loathing of the simplicity of it--as if [these books
listed] the ingredients for some sort of lovely bromide to get over
the flu.</TE>
<TE>   "The fast food mentality creeps into our emotional lives, where we
are not willing to just sit for very long with our feelings,
especially uncomfortable ones," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Just like the fictional Floss tribe, Silberling says he and
Schaeffer's parents fought to preserve a complete memory of the
person they lost, warts and all. Perhaps the film's most laudable
effort is its insistence on piecing together an all-inclusive
emotional landscape in the wake of a loss.</TE>
<TE>   Recalls Gyllenhaal: "The hardest thing was keeping the humor alive
in a situation where people would think there was no irony." The
young actor says that his own instinct was to veer toward portraying
sadness on screen. "But Brad would steer me back toward the reality
and say, 'Trust me. This was a funny moment, and awkward and
embarrassing.' "</TE>

<LD>Greg Dulli had what he terms a front-row seat for the peak of
independent rock a decade ago. His band, Afghan Whigs, was on the
roster of Seattle's Sub Pop Records just when Nirvana started to
explode as a national phenomenon, and the Northwest rock scene was
spotlighted as the ground zero of grunge.</LD>
<LD>   "Consider this," Dulli says. "Sub Pop had Nirvana before they went
to Geffen Records, and they had just lost Soundgarden a year before.
But they still had Mudhoney, L7, us, Tad, the Fluid--a pretty rockin'
roster. We'd all get together and play monster shows in Seattle and
it was like mini-Woodstock."</LD>
<LD>   Selene Vigil, leader of 7 Year Bitch, was in the middle of it as
well, with her band recording for tiny Olympia, Wash.-based C/Z
Records.</LD>
<TE>   "It was very exciting, so many bands doing so well," she says.
"That was the best time. That was the most fun."</TE>
<TE>   The fun ended when Nirvana, a trio from Aberdeen, Wash., signed
with Geffen Records and hit the pop stratosphere. With "Nevermind,"
and Seattle-based Pearl Jam's Epic Records debut, "Ten," right beside
it, the new generation had its soundtrack, and the major labels
smelled green in all that plaid flannel.</TE>
<TE>   It was a grunge gold rush. Record executives flocked first to the
Northwest and then to other indie-rock centers, offering unproven
acts six-and sometimes seven-figure deals, and promising the kind of
promotional muscle that was out of the indie labels' reach. In some
cases, majors swallowed up indie labels whole to get one key act or
to have a "farm team" in the house.</TE>
<TE>   It put a lot of money in the indie economy, but it also sucked
that scene dry. Dulli's Whigs and Vigil's 7 Year Bitch, which both
broke up after ill-fated relationships with major labels, were just
two of the casualties.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many ways to skin the cat, but whatever way you skin
that cat, it's skinned, and you destroy the culture," says Douglas
Mark, a music attorney who represents two L.A. independent labels,
Vagrant and Epitaph. "You can sign one artist and hope he's a hit. Or
you can buy a label and hope one or more of their artists will be a
hit."</TE>
<TE>   All this history is important to remember, because independent
rock is back with a vengeance after a long, fallow decade.</TE>
<TE>   The developments of the past year have been dizzying: The White
Stripes made three strong albums in Detroit without major-label
involvement. The Hives are leading a Swedish garage-rock invasion.
Vagrant Records has become a focus for the rising tide of heartfelt
rock known as emo, with Florida's Dashboard Confessional, the Get Up
Kids and the Alkaline Trio leading the way. Omaha has become an
unlikely capital with Saddle Creek Records and its roster, including
Bright Eyes and the Faint. And in New York, the electroclash movement
is taking hold with such acts as Miss Kittin and Fischerspooner
breaking out.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of exciting, dynamic music is challenging the norm," says
Craig Kallman, co-president of the major label Atlantic Records,
which recently signed Palo Alto female punk-metal band the Donnas
(see Pop Eye, Page 64). "As more young bands get inspired to blaze
their own trails, we'll have a more diverse spectrum of sounds on the
radio, which we desperately need."</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning, all rock 'n' roll was indie rock: Elvis started
out with the Memphis storefront operation Sun Records, Chuck Berry
recorded for the Chicago blues label Chess, and Little Richard was
with Specialty.</TE>
<TE>   The majors--Columbia, RCA, Decca--were for old-folks music, but
they couldn't ignore rock forever. They stepped in, and for much of
the '60s, creativity and corporate demands managed to coexist with
memorable results.</TE>
<TE>   But major-label pop and rock went stodgy in the '70s, triggering
the punk rock revolution and a new explosion of independent
labels--I.R.S., SST, Slash, Twin/Tone et al--that produced such
essential bands as R.E.M., Sonic Youth, Husker Du and the
Replacements.</TE>
<TE>   In that era, thriving rock communities grew in Minneapolis,
Seattle, Chicago and other non-media capitals, away from the
limelight and pressures of the mainstream, as well as in Los Angeles
and New York. Encouraged by their peers and fans to be adventurous
and relevant, musicians developed at a natural pace that wouldn't be
tolerated by clock-conscious, hit-hungry major labels. They also
experimented, striving for individuality rather than trying to fit a
format.</TE>
<TE>   Today's resurgence took root while the mainstream occupied itself
with teen pop, cartoonish rock and over-the-top hip-hop. The new
indies were able to sprout and develop almost unnoticed, and suddenly
indie rock is once again where music fans--and, inevitably, major
labels--are discovering energy and creativity.</TE>
<TE>   So given the history, is there any way that the music business
won't mess it up this time too.</TE>
<TE>   "Short answer?" says Dulli. "No. They're going to [mess] it up. I
just think it's the natural course of things.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's any inherent evil on the majors' part," he
adds. "Indies rise out of the ashes during times of bad music, and
we've had bad music for the last few years. If we consider screwing
it up to be coming and co-opting and changing it, then yeah. And it
will happen again 10 years from now."</TE>
<TE>   That may be, but some of the key players in the current indie
world say they have learned lessons from the past and are determined
to do things differently.</TE>
<TE>   "I think major labels can do wonderful things," Saddle Creek owner
Robb Nansel says. "It just doesn't happen too often. Geffen and the
other majors should have been happy with Nirvana and what they did
for the music scene, but they just were not satisfied. They wanted
more and more Nirvanas, and that just doesn't exist in the real
world, and eventually it all falls apart, as we saw in the '90s."</TE>
<TE>   Saddle Creek as a label and several individual acts on the roster
have so far rebuffed all the major-label offers that have come their
way.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of the [indie] labels from the '90s found their
major-label alliances to be too enticing," Nansel says. "Most of them
are out of those deals now or went under in the process. We are
certainly aware of that and have tried to avoid those sorts of
things. I am sure there is a deal that could benefit us and our
artists, but I don't think it has existed in the past and I certainly
have not seen a proposal for one."</TE>
<TE>   Vagrant, though, has formed an alliance with Interscope that label
owner Richard Egan believes does avoid most of the problems indies
have encountered on this road. Earlier in the year, Interscope
purchased a large stake in Vagrant (reportedly 49% for more than $10
million), but while the larger company has become involved in
promoting and developing Dashboard Confessional, it isn't even
distributing any of the smaller label's releases. Vagrant still has
three years remaining on a distribution deal through New York
independent TVT Records.</TE>
<TE>   "Interscope has bought equity in us, and when we choose to use
their marketing department, they help us by stepping in," Egan says.
"But all of the acts we had are still signed to Vagrant proper, and
when their deals are up, they can do what they want. They're not
obligated to go to Interscope. We built in safeguards to address
things that concern me. I don't believe in long-term deals that lock
up artists. Interscope, to their credit, came in and said that this
is a different spin on the way they do things, but they were
adaptable."</TE>
<TE>   V2 Records, technically an indie but in effect a major label, was
also adaptable in making a deal with the White Stripes earlier this
year. Rather than a conventional contract for three or more albums
with the label advancing a large sum to the band to be recouped from
royalties, the Stripes deal is a partnership for just two albums,
with the band and label co-owning the recordings. In fact, V2
President Andy Gershon is resistant to proposals for standard deals.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a band we're trying to sign, but the lawyer sent out a
memo asking for a million dollars a record," Gershon says. "This is a
band that has never made a record, has no real following. But there
are several labels interested. They should be in partnership with a
label, not taking an 'us versus them' mentality. But people are
scared of change."</TE>
<TE>   Dulli, Vigil and other veterans of the previous indie scene say
that they made the move to majors with their eyes wide open and have
few regrets, even if they failed to grow too far beyond their indie
success.</TE>
<TE>   "It turned out to be fine," says Page Hamilton, whose band Helmet
was plucked from the indie ranks by Interscope in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "We made money and bought houses. But that said, over the long
haul, the relationship with major labels is not what it is with indie
labels. Everybody wants to make money, but there are fewer people at
major labels who have much passion for music or knowledge of
underground music or a desire to do something that belongs
specifically to you and not a mass-produced genre."</TE>

have the hindsight of going through it once. Now we know."</TE>

<DH>A New York exhibition celebrates the brief but dazzling
decade when Ferus Gallery introduced the best of a new generation of
artists</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA ISENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ask Irving Blum about running the Ferus Gallery, and he'll tell you
right away that there's been too much speculation about Ferus and not
enough appreciation. People are beginning to forget the now-legendary
space that put Los Angeles--and Blum--on the art world's map in the
early '60s.</LD>
<LD>   Launched in 1957 by artist Edward Kienholz and museum curator
Walter Hopps, Ferus was the right place at the right time, an
important early incubator of contemporary and avant-garde art here.
Besides introducing local talents Billy Al Bengston, Robert Irwin, Ed
Moses and Ed Ruscha, the gallery also brought to Los Angeles
audiences the latest work by such New York artists as Joseph Cornell,
Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, Frank Stella and Andy Warhol.</LD>
<LD>   "When Ferus opened, it was the one really contemporary gallery
dealing with younger Los Angeles and San Francisco artists; and that
generation was the first, because of that support, to train here,
work here, show here and make national reputations," says Henry
Hopkins, former director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art
and what is now the UCLA Hammer Museum. "The result is that Ferus
stands as a symbol of the transition of Los Angeles from provincial
center to what it is today--an internationally recognized center for
the arts."</LD>
<TE>   There were major museum exhibitions about Ferus in Southern
California in the '60s and '70s. But that was long ago, says Ferus
director and, later, co-owner Blum, and there had been nothing in New
York. So when New York-based dealer Larry Gagosian suggested a show,
says the ever-dapper Blum, 71, "I just leaped at it. I think what was
happening in California at that time needs to be celebrated."</TE>
<TE>   The celebration, underway at the Gagosian Gallery in New York's
Chelsea district, exhibits about 45 sculptures, paintings, drawings
and other artworks by 22 artists shown at Ferus during its 10-year
lifetime. Many of the works were first exhibited at the gallery;
others represent the kind of work that made Ferus famous.</TE>
<TE>   Assembled by Blum, the exhibition also includes Ferus Gallery
exhibition announcements by Lichtenstein and others, several art
scene photographs taken by Dennis Hopper, and an elaborate, 144-page
catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Highlights include Warhol's suite of 32 paintings, "Campbell's
Soup Cans" (the ones MOCA couldn't get for the Warhol retrospective
that recently closed here), on loan from New York's Museum of Modern
Art, and Ruscha's "Los Angeles County Museum on Fire," on loan from
the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington. In all, Blum has gathered from
one to four works by each of the 20 to 25 artists he tried to exhibit
regularly at Ferus.</TE>
<TE>   When he and Gagosian first agreed several months ago to do the
exhibition, recalls Blum, "I went home and had to lie down. In order
to make it real, there was so much I had to relive and think about
and deal with and remember."</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City but raised in Phoenix, Blum went back to
Manhattan in 1955 to seek work in the theater. But despite a lifelong
flair for drama and a booming, Cary Grant-style voice, Blum began to
spend more time in art galleries than theaters. In 1957, when "my
nostalgia for the West got the better of me," he headed for Los
Angeles and soon found his way to Ferus.</TE>
<TE>   Blum arrived less than a year after Kienholz and Hopps opened shop
behind an antiques store on La Cienega Boulevard. Ruscha has likened
the gallery to a jazz catalog "where there are a lot of different
voices under the same record label. Each had a very distinctive take
on the world and on his work, and so that made it a very vital place
to aspire to and to be."</TE>
<TE>   Ferus was "a gathering place and macho intellectual gang bang,"
recalls Bengston, a Ferus regular. "It was a place to strut your
stuff and be yourself. It was more important to be an artist than to
be successful, because being an artist, there was no chance to be
successful."</TE>
<TE>   Sensing opportunity, Blum says he "quickly organized a meeting
with Kienholz, who was desperate to get out of the gallery and spend
more time in the studio. We agreed on a price of $500 for me to buy
into the gallery--for nothing, there was no inventory--and Walter and
I became partners."</TE>
<TE>   In 1958, Hopps and Blum moved the gallery to a better space across
the street, and, says Bengston, "Irving's passion and Walter's
erudition were a hard act to resist." When Hopps left Ferus in 1962
for a curatorship at the Pasadena Art Museum (now the Norton Simon
Museum), Blum took over the directorship on his own. With financial
help from Los Angeles patron Sayde Moss, who became a silent partner,
Blum began to move Ferus away from what was essentially a boy's club
to a business.</TE>
<TE>   He began adding New York artists, particularly those "who fell
through the cracks. From being in New York in the '50s, I was
familiar with Josef Albers, for instance, and thought he was
enormously overlooked and cheap. I could buy his work with very
little money. Cornell boxes were $500--now they're half a million and
up."</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of the possibility of doing these great exhibitions,"
continues Blum, "my great luck, aside from my own taste, was timing.
Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Frank Stella and
Ellsworth Kelly were just surfacing in New York about the same time
as a generation of very gifted young California artists such as Ed
Kienholz, Bob Irwin, John Altoon, Billy Al Bengston, Ken Price, Ed
Moses, Ed Ruscha and Larry Bell, were surfacing in a parallel way
here. It was just wonderful timing."</TE>
<TE>   Committed local art collectors such as Robert Rowan, Edwin Janss,
Betty Asher, Michael Blankfort and others helped keep the doors open,
Blum recalls. So did the brief L.A. life of Artforum magazine,
which--"miracle of miracles," says Blum--was housed upstairs for two
years before moving to New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Artforum's arrival in Los Angeles extended the life of the Ferus
Gallery single-handedly," Blum says, "because we got for the first
time critical concern and attention. Artforum was like an answered
prayer."</TE>
<TE>   But Ferus' moment couldn't last forever. As his New York artists
became better known, they also became more expensive, and Blum lost
his access. Local collectors would head for New York, where there was
a wider selection, and eventually so would Blum.</TE>
<TE>   Ferus closed in 1967 when Blum sought "a financial leg up" by
opening Ferus/Pace with Arne Glimcher, owner of New York's Pace
Gallery. That venture lasted less than two years, and Blum next
opened his own Irving Blum Gallery on La Cienega. Blum moved to New
York in 1973, when he partnered with dealer Joseph Hellman in the
Blum/Hellman gallery, which added an L.A. outpost for a while. Blum
returned full time to Los Angeles in 1998 as a private dealer.</TE>
<TE>   Nestled in a chair at Gagosian's Beverly Hills gallery, just a few
miles from where he once ran Ferus, Blum looks over catalog proofs
for the New York retrospective, laughs his easy laugh and reminisces.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Kauffman: "He was years ahead of his time."</TE>
<TE>   Ellsworth Kelly: "A giant."</TE>
<TE>   Hassel Smith: "The work's at least as interesting as Motherwell.
He would have had the most extraordinary run had he lived in New
York. But he lived in Sebastopol."</TE>
<TE>   Many of those artists also figured in two earlier exhibitions on
Ferus. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art organized "Late Fifties
at the Ferus" in 1968, and the Newport Harbor Art Museum organized
"The Last Time I Saw Ferus" in 1976. Although Blum says he would have
liked to have done this show in Los Angeles as well, it's too big for
Gagosian's Beverly Hills gallery, and local museum curators were not
interested this time around.</TE>
<TE>   Several Southern California museums are lending work to the
exhibition, however, including LACMA, the Museum of Contemporary Art
and the Norton Simon Museum. Artworks have also been lent by other
museums, artists and their estates, collectors and their estates, and
Blum himself. "I called everybody and facilitated the loans, twisting
lots of arms in the process," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The dealer began with a wish list of paintings and sculpture,
choosing first by preference, then by availability. "I didn't in
every instance get exactly what I wanted, but I came close," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Jay DeFeo, one of Ferus' few female artists, has a painting in the
exhibition, Blum says, running through a checklist, while Ken Price
has lent three sculptures from the period that Blum says he had never
seen before. Blum famously paired Jasper Johns and Kurt Schwitters'
work at Ferus in a 1960 exhibition, and works by both artists are in
the Gagosian show. So are two of Frank Stella's 20-foot-long,
mural-size protractors, which Blum says are for sale--at $1 million
apiece.</TE>
<TE>   While Gagosian's Chelsea gallery is huge, with some 6,000 square
feet of exhibition space, Blum says a few things still had to be left
out. "We did an exhibition of Kienholz called 'Roxy's,' which was his
interpretation of a Southwestern bordello, that occupied the entire
space of the old Ferus. I would have loved to have re-created that.
Or Ed [Kienholz's] version of Barney's Beanery where all the artists
congregated every night to drink. But, alas, we didn't have the
space, and finally, I think, [the Kienholz assemblage] 'Walter Hopps
Hopps Hopps' is a fine addition and, although fragile, was loaned to
this exhibition."</TE>
<TE>   Blum's greatest coup, however, is probably the suite of Warhol's
soup can paintings, which the Museum of Modern Art had declined to
lend to MOCA. Although Blum thinks that was "enormously odd," even
"perverse," a MOMA spokeswoman explains that the MOCA loan would have
come at the same time as the opening show at MOMA's new Queens
facility, but now some rotations are taking place in its inaugural
presentation there.</TE>
<TE>   Blum first saw the paintings at Warhol's New York studio, then
exhibited them at Ferus in July 1962, in what he says was "the first
show anywhere in the world of Andy's work." Blum sold half a dozen of
the paintings for $100 apiece, then changed his mind about breaking
up the 32-painting set and persuaded his buyers to sell them back to
him. Then Blum bought the full suite from Warhol for $100 a month
until he reached Warhol's $1,000 price tag. In 1996, MOMA acquired
them from Blum as a purchase and partial gift totaling in the
millions.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ferus originally exhibited the paintings on ledges around
the gallery, at Gagosian they are hung together much as they have
been installed at MOMA. "It was probably a very fresh way to show
them then," Gagosian says of the ledge arrangement. "But now that
they're so important a part of art history, that kind of installation
might look a little coy."</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in Los Angeles, Gagosian says that the Ferus
exhibition is something he'd hoped to do for several years. "I got
out of UCLA around 1970, and Ferus was gone," he says. "I think it's
important that people remember what was accomplished by a gallery
with that kind of vision, ahead of the curve. Since I'm involved with
a lot of artists who Irving pioneered exhibitions with, it became
doubly interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the Ferus experience could happen again today, Blum
immediately replies, "Absolutely not. We're talking about a
generation of artists roughly parallel on the East and West coasts
who were radical, inventive and celebrated, all of them surfacing at
approximately the same time. It was one of those extraordinary
moments in the history of art that simply can't be duplicated."</TE>

<LD>Disney insists on dubbing Hayao Miyazaki's animated masterpieces with
American voices, rather than simply using subtitles, because
"Miyazaki is a truly visual storyteller ....If your eyes are fixed on
the bottom of the screen, you're going to miss visual elements that
are unique and wonderful" ("Entering Strange Realms," by Charles
Solomon, Sept 8).</LD>
<LD>   Was not "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" also a splendidly visual
experience? That film did not appear to suffer from its
subtitled-only theatrical release. When will Disney begin to market
Miyazaki's work to those who can actually appreciate it?
Discriminating audiences have no problem reading subtitles.</LD>

<LD>Who is to say what Mary looked like? Nobody really knows (Letters,
Sept. 8, 15). We all are used to the conventions used to depict
her--flowing robes, covered head, downcast eyes and sad expression.
Is this really how she dressed, or is this how we imagine she
dressed?</LD>
<LD>   Or did she look like the Mary in Notre Dame in Paris, with crown
on head, body-hugging dress, body in Gothic s-curve pose with baby
Jesus on hip? She looks decidedly medieval French in that statue.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, those who built Notre Dame put her in their own
time, just as Robert Graham did with his Mary.</LD>
<TE>   As far as Cardinal Roger M. Mahony's folly, imagine if those who
built the same Notre Dame, or in fact any of the great cathedrals of
Europe, had not done so because there were better things to do with
the money. Can you imagine if these magnificent (though not always
"beautiful"), faith-inspiring edifices were not here to renew us and
fill us with awe and wonder at the glory of God? I believe feeding
the spirit is as important as feeding the belly, and a cathedral in
Los Angeles does just that for many thousands of people.</TE>
<TE>   No one thinks about who built Notre Dame, and soon enough no one
will think about who built our own awe-inspiring cathedral, but God
bless Cardinal Mahony's courage and vision to have done so.</TE>

<LD>Sorry to put a damper on Leah Ollman's cute opening: "Tom Cruise as
Jean-Baptiste Greuze? Well, the names do rhyme." But they don't ("An
Acquired Taste," Sept. 15). The French pronunciation of "eu" is not
the same as the English of "u," or in this case of "ui." The closest
pronunciation we have in English is the sound of "ur" as in Ur of the
Chaldeans.</LD>

<LD>Kenneth Turan's Perspective on the emotional bankruptcy in
contemporary commercial cinema ("Big Heart, Big Box Office," Sept. 1)
evokes the filmmaking philosophy of Sam Fuller (a man who certainly
knew how to stir emotion and churn viscera): Film is a battleground.
Love, hate, violence, action, death ... in a word, "emotion." Perhaps
the general anemic quality of current cinema would be alleviated if
more directors adopted his credo.</LD>

<LD>Over the long run, the issue of melding Grand Avenue and the summit
of Bunker Hill with the historic core of downtown ought to pale in
comparison with planning and development in the South Park district
("A Core Dilemma," by Nicolai Ouroussoff, Aug. 18).</LD>
<LD>   The latter area, "the floor of downtown," might be considered a
blank canvas that could be far more imaginatively utilized toward
ameliorating schisms and truly bringing this region together.</LD>
<LD>   The Hollywood sign just doesn't do it, folks. And Walt Disney
Concert Hall cannot truly represent our polyglot reality despite its
undeniable grandeur. We need a newer symbol, a very singular act of
civic aspiration, somewhere along Hope Street.</LD>

<TE>   Homeless and other destitute people are in plenty of places west
of downtown L.A. Drive Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills and you
will probably see a few pushing their shopping carts. Two weeks ago,
I was approached by a homeless person one block off Sunset Boulevard
in the heart of Pacific Palisades. Santa Monica is crawling with
homeless people. Walking the Third Street Promenade, you can't avoid
the smell of urine. Venice is hardly safe at night.</TE>
<TE>   Get a life, Ms. Wells. You and your snobbish Westside friends

with caution, as I have, and see the sights and meet the people.</TE>

<DH>A third wave of German cinema, sparked by the fall of the
Berlin Wall, is gaining notice in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WADE MAJOR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone paying attention to the recent foreign film scene has probably
noticed a decidedly Teutonic streak in the offerings. Normally
distributed sparingly in the U.S., German films are suddenly in
vogue, with several current releases--"Mostly Martha," "Das
Experiment" and the English-language "Invincible"--giving art-house
audiences their richest exposure to contemporary German cinema in
decades.</LD>
<LD>   And that's only the beginning. Come November, 10 more new German
films will receive U.S. premieres as part of AFI Fest's "Made in
Germany" section. It will be highlighted by the award-winning
opening-night presentation "Nowhere in Africa," set for theatrical
release in March.</LD>
<LD>   Are we seeing a nascent third wave of German cinema, which the
filmmakers there say has been in the making for more than a decade?
If the current trend lasts, it would mark a turnaround for an
industry that has struggled for more than 50 years to recapture the
glory of its pre-World War II golden era, when it earned a global
reputation as Hollywood's only legitimate foreign rival.</LD>
<TE>   "You could say it started in 1990 when the Berlin Wall came down,"
says "Das Experiment" star Moritz Bleibtreu. "TV channels started to
produce movies, feature films were beginning to be made for the first
time again. What you see now is a people trying to reinvent
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   "I think that people definitely are more confident about their
films in Germany," says "Mostly Martha" writer-director Sandra
Nettelbeck. "It's this feeling that we can make films people want to
see, films people will pay to see."</TE>
<TE>   Given the country's turbulent 20th century history, it's not
surprising that an event as momentous as reunification would
reinvigorate Germany's young filmmakers. Both previous German film
movements--expressionistic Weimer Cinema in the '20s and the New
German Cinema of the '60s and '70s--were outgrowths of wartime
defeats, movements driven by the belief that a new and improved
German identity could be forged through the power of cinema. Although
neither movement was ultimately able to transform German society,
their idealistic practitioners--Fritz Lang and F.W. Murnau in the
1920s; Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Wim Wenders, Werner Herzog and
Volker Schlondorff in the '60s and '70s--did transform global cinema.
Their influence can be seen in the visually arresting work of
present-day expressionists such as Tim Burton, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and
Ridley Scott, as well as the boldly meditative films of
existentialist-postmodernists like Britain's Mike Leigh, France's
Francois Ozon and, in this country, Todd Solondz and Paul Thomas
Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the first genuine postwar generation," recalls
"Invincible" director Herzog. "We had to invent cinema for ourselves.
There was a void of a quarter of a century. And we were the first
ones to articulate ourselves in trying to find our own language. Now,
with reunification, the situation is new again."</TE>
<TE>   For American audiences, the turning point came with the 1999
release of director Tom Tykwer's "Run Lola Run," starring Bleibtreu.
In the end, American audiences rallied around "Lola" to the tune of
$7 million, making it one of the most successful German films ever
released in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   German Federal Film Board representative Corina Danckwerts, who
established the Made in Germany series two years ago before allying
with the AFI Fest this year, credits Tykwer and "Lola" with breaking
long-held stereotypes, allowing other films and filmmakers to emerge
on the world stage.</TE>
<TE>   "The hallmark of this generation has been directors with fresh
ideas," she says. "And 'Lola' was the German film that made people
aware of that."</TE>
<TE>   But Tykwer is quick to temper any unrealistic expectations. "All
these developments people look for as pointing to a 'wave,' they're
usually slower than everyone wants them to be. I totally believe that
it's happening. But I don't believe it's happening in the way
everyone would like, with dozens of brilliant films coming out of
Germany every year. It has to slowly develop and get into the brains
of our other filmmakers so we can make films that cross borders."</TE>
<TE>   The apparent contradiction in Tykwer's suggestion--that a
rediscovery of German identity through cinema should depend on less,
rather than more parochialism--underscores the principle dilemma of
German society, namely how to escape the residual shadow of Nazism
and World War II without escaping Germany. It's no secret that while
Germany has never struggled to produce cinematic talent, it has
continually struggled to retain it, losing most of its best and
brightest to Hollywood. Notable emigres of the '20s and '30s include
both Lang and Murnau as well as Billy Wilder, Ernst Lubitsch, Marlene
Dietrich and Josef von Sternberg.</TE>
<TE>   Key figures from later generations have also emigrated--Wenders
and Herzog live in the U.S., as do such A-list action directors as
Roland Emmerich ("Independence Day," "The Patriot") and Wolfgang
Petersen ("The Perfect Storm," "Air Force One").</TE>
<TE>   "I came at the end of that New German Cinema wave, from
television," Petersen remembers. "Then I had the chance to make this
really great, ambitious project with 'Das Boot.' And it was a huge
success. It was a new experience for Germany because it got worldwide
recognition and six Oscar nominations. Then we did 'The NeverEnding
Story,' which was also a big success, and suddenly there was the
feeling that this might be the time for German cinema--or even
European cinema--to do something in competition to Hollywood,
something really artistically interesting and challenging but also
successful, something that could go beyond the borders of Germany. I
was really hoping and waiting to see what was next. But there was no
next."</TE>
<TE>   "When I was there, nobody wanted to do commercial movies,"
Emmerich says. "I was doing my little movies and Wolfgang was doing
his bigger movies, but we didn't get much support from the media or
audiences. Now it's different. They're embracing mainstream movies."</TE>
<TE>   But that embrace, says Tykwer, has a dark side. "The stupid thing
about successful European films is that most of them are comedies
with very local humor. That has been the case in Germany. Recently
we've discovered there's a different way to approach film. And what I
like about it is that it has variety. It doesn't look like a fashion,
like there's a new 'style' coming from Germany."</TE>
<TE>   Although both "Mostly Martha" and "Das Experiment" attempt to
comment on life in present-day Germany, their stories and styles are
diametrically opposed. "Martha" weaves a romantic drama via the life
of a strong-willed female chef, and "Das Experiment" treads in the
action-thriller realm with a nightmarish tale of a prison simulation
gone disastrously wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Even historical films like "Invincible" and "Nowhere in Africa,"
both of which begin during the prewar years and focus on the seeds of
anti-Semitism, take wildly different approaches. "Invincible's"
fact-based story of a Polish-Jewish blacksmith's rise to fame as a
cabaret strongman is a moralistic fable in the same vein as Herzog's
previous films "Aguirre, Wrath of God" and "Fitzcarraldo." "Nowhere
in Africa" takes the more classical biopic approach to the trials and
tribulations of a German-Jewish family of refugees in Kenya during
the '30s and '40s.</TE>
<TE>   A key economic component of the German industry's renewal is the
growing domain of international co-productions. Herzog's "Invincible"
was co-produced with the U.K.'s Film Four, while "Mostly Martha"
culled its financing from sources in Austria, Switzerland and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   A better example is Tykwer's latest, the Miramax release "Heaven."
Co-written by the late Polish master Krzysztof Kieslowski ("The
Decalogue") as the first of a trilogy (still to come are "Hell" and
"Purgatory"), it stars American Giovanni Ribisi and Australian Cate
Blanchett, and was filmed in Italy in Italian and English.</TE>
<TE>   "A film leads you to the country where it's set, where it has the
potential to be the best film," Tykwer says. "I never thought I was
going to make a film in Italy. But the subjective identity of my
films will always stay German because I am German. I can't peel off
that skin, and I don't want to."</TE>
<TE>   Even as he develops an international career, Tykwer remains
committed to the German industry as a partner in the artist-driven
X-Filme, one of the country' most progressive production companies.
It's unlike most German companies, which too often tailor their
choices to the tastes of those who dispense government arts
subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic hindrance is the way films are financed in our
country," explains "Das Experiment" director Oliver Hirschbiegel.
"They pretty much rely on government funding. You always have to have
a TV station on board and the rest is put in by distributors."</TE>
<TE>   Hirschbiegel goes on to decry a system that, he says, fails to
sufficiently reward talent, too often chasing away those like
Petersen, whose 1981 "Das Boot" is still considered one of the finest
German films ever made. "Everyone wants to move up in the world. As a
German director, that's very hard because the amount of money you're
paid is nothing compared to what you get in Hollywood. We live in a
capitalist system, but in the film industry, it's not like that."</TE>
<TE>   "Nowhere in Africa" director Caroline Link, whose 1999 film
"Beyond Silence" was nominated for the foreign language Oscar, also
blames audience apathy. "In Germany, there's the feeling that every
movie has to be everything, otherwise our little industry is
disappointed. The distribution companies become hesitant about buying
more German movies because audiences don't want to see them. 'Das
Experiment' is an exception. 'Mostly Martha' is an exception. My film
is an exception. So what you have in America are three exceptions."</TE>
<TE>   Making matters more uncertain at the moment, say observers, is the
collapse of media mogul Leo Kirch's once mighty Kirch Media in April,
a disintegration that even sent shock waves through Hollywood, where
Kirch's debts to major studios like Paramount, Columbia and Disney
(for German distribution rights to Hollywood films) are estimated at
more than $1.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   While it's no secret that German money has benefited Hollywood
more than Germany, helping to finance everything from bombs like
"Battlefield Earth" to the recent Mel Gibson Vietnam War epic "We
Were Soldiers," the insolvency of a behemoth like Kirch has been
devastating for smaller German production companies less able to
secure alternate financing.</TE>
<TE>   But if Germans often lack enthusiasm for their own cinema,
Americans seem willing to pick up the slack, embracing not only new
German films but also classics, as witnessed by the recent American
Cinematheque tribute to Herzog and the ongoing Hollywood
Entertainment Museum exhibition and L.A. County Museum of Art film
series commemorating the Marlene Dietrich centennial. In October,
Kino will bring a restored print of Lang's "Metropolis" to West
L.A.'s Nuart, succeeding its highly successful New York run with
another restored German silent, F.W. Murnau's "Faust." There has even
been renewed interest in controversial 100-year-old Nazi-era
filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl, soon to be the subject of a Jodie Foster
movie.</TE>
<TE>   It's an atmosphere that has Danckwerts optimistic enough to see a
silver lining even in the Kirch situation. She calls it "a great
opportunity for the filmmaking community to restructure itself and
come out more independent in the end."</TE>
<TE>   For American audiences, Danckwerts says there are "more than
enough" great German movies yet in the pipeline, pointing to "Nowhere
in Africa" and the acclaimed Cold War drama "The Tunnel," a hit at
last year's Made in Germany, as key releases for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe it's here to stay," Tykwer adds. "It took a long time,
but now we're back at a level that is world standard. It absolutely
can compete with any other country. The second step is to connect
this potential with really interesting stories and characters and
subjective visions."</TE>
<TE>   To those who still might wish to follow in his Hollywood
footsteps, Petersen adds a word of caution. "I think it's very
important, first of all, to start with making great German films," he
says. "You have to be careful about trying to run away from Germany
too soon, too early to make it somewhere else. It's not easy to make
it somewhere else. I know so many filmmakers who tried to jump three
steps ahead and make it here and failed. Go back and do a couple of
films in Germany, even if it's hard. Put something together, even if
it's hard. I think it's important to find your own style, that it
grows out of your own German filmmaking."</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not speak of the film industry," Herzog says. "Let's speak
of the situation of Germany itself. Yes, I think Germany is changing.
I do believe that Germany is finding its role in a larger context.
And in the end, I think Germany will find a more healthy attitude
toward its own identity."</TE>

<HD>California's Early Piece Makers</HD>
<DH>A quilt show covers the state's history--from well-traveled
blankets carted in by pioneers to those made by star-struck residents</DH>

<LD>"Quilts came early to California," says curator Sandi Fox. Then she
ticks off the ways: "They came by wagon, on the backs of adventurers'
horses, on ships around Cape Horn and on mules across the Isthmus of
Panama. Eventually, when railroad tracks reached the West Coast, they
arrived by train as well."</LD>
<LD>   That's only the beginning of a little-known aspect of California's
cultural legacy, but Fox spins much more of the tale in an
exhibition, "Quilts: California Bound, California Made 1840-1940,"
and its profusely illustrated catalog. Opening Oct. 1 at the FIDM
Museum-Galleries, at the Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising
in downtown Los Angeles, the show offers 38 examples of well-traveled
imports and works produced in California.</LD>
<LD>   The state's pioneers "all came from somewhere else, and so did the
quilts they brought with them," Fox says. "Those and the quilts they
made after they arrived became California's quilts." That richly
diverse, patched-together legacy provided the impetus for her current
project, she says.</LD>
<TE>   The story unfolds in visual form in the exhibition, through the
quilts themselves. Text on labels and gallery walls is amplified in
the catalog with a short, lively essay on each piece. Many questions
remain about the history and provenance, but Fox and other
researchers cited in the catalog provide considerable insight into an
art form that is anything but static.</TE>
<TE>   For anyone who knows just a bit of quilt history, the variety of
works exhibited is astonishing. Made of cotton, wool, silk, satin,
velvet and ribbons, the quilts are embroidered, inscribed and
embellished with paint, ink, leather and photographs. "Soldier's
Quilt" is adorned with military badges, miniature flags and
photographs of four American presidents--Lincoln, Grant, Garfield and
McKinley. "Cigar Ribbons Quilt" is laboriously constructed of
recycled silk ribbons that were stamped with brand names and tied
around bundles of cigars.</TE>
<TE>   Made to celebrate special occasions, tell family stories or raise
funds in war time or for political causes, as well as to provide
warmth and domestic decoration, the quilts encompass a multitude of
designs. "Rose of Sharon Quilt," made by two sisters in Missouri in
1857, is an impeccably crafted ode to patriotism that combines
white-on-white American bald eagles with a red, pink and green floral
motif. In sharp contrast, a crude wool quilt made in the Sacramento
Valley during the late 19th century is sparsely decorated with rough
shapes of livestock brands.</TE>
<TE>   The quilters are also a diverse lot. A newly married couple,
William and Rosina Widman, started an appliqued quilt of red buds and
green leaves around 1855, partly to pass the time on ships that
carried them from the East Coast to the Isthmus of Panama and on to
San Francisco. Five children who lived on a farm in Oakland made a
quilt as a Christmas gift for their grandmother in 1893, embroidering
images of plants, animals and farm equipment on velvet and satin
squares. About the same time, a grandmother who lived in New York
made a crazy-quilt storybook for her grandchildren, and included
vignettes from "Uncle Tom's Cabin," "Little Women," "Uncle Remus" and
"Heidi."</TE>
<TE>   Faced with all of these textile creations, family stories and
historical facts, Fox is in her element. A former curator at the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art who specializes in 19th century quilts,
she has organized a dozen major exhibitions of quilts and written
widely on the subject. The current show began with an invitation from
fashion historian Margaret Pexton Murray, former director of the FIDM
Museum-Galleries, who died last year.</TE>
<TE>   "When Maggie asked me to do this, I realized that there is much
more to it than quilts made in California," Fox says. "What came to
California is equally fascinating." Combining the two components let
her lengthen the timeline of the show and include a greater mix of
styles than might be expected.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest work, made in the early 19th century, is the
elaborately detailed "Chinoiserie Quilt." Constructed of English
block-printed cottons, it reflects a craze for Far Eastern decorative
arts, inspired by the Dutch and East Indian trading companies. The
newest item, "Laguna Beach Quilt," a pastel idyll produced around
1940, portrays a cozy seaside bungalow on a perfect summer day.</TE>
<TE>   "These compose California's quilting legacy," Fox says, looking
around the galleries as the quilts and a few dresses made of similar
materials are positioned in an installation orchestrated by Bernard
Kester, design consultant for exhibitions at LACMA. Borrowed from 17
public and private collections, they include 10 quilts from LACMA,
four from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and one
each from the Autry Museum of Western Heritage, the Oakland Museum of
California and the San Diego Historical Society.</TE>
<TE>   The show and book are laid out thematically, in roughly
chronological order, to show a progression of styles and palettes.
"Chinoiserie Quilt" is followed by a group of works brought from New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and the Delaware Valley. Not
surprisingly, considering the sweep of their origins, these works are
made of everything from vivid starbursts to subdued plaids to floral
chintz cutouts.</TE>
<TE>   "Botany was a terrific preoccupation in the 19th century," Fox
says, strolling into a section that focuses on plants cultivated and
observed by the quilters, both in their original homes and in
California. "When you read women's diaries and journals, you see that
they carried traditions with them," she says. "When women set foot in
California, they picked up their needles, but they didn't invent a
California quilt. They established the familiar in new territory."</TE>
<TE>   Early quilts are often works of "uncommon sophistication," Fox
says, because they were made by women who lived in relative comfort
and had access to expensive materials. They gave way to sturdier
pieced quilts, produced by settlers under more difficult
circumstances, but that didn't prevent the quilters from turning out
works of striking graphic quality or unfathomable difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   "Broken Dishes Quilt," for example, is the sort of textile
composition that art aficionados sometimes equate with abstract
painting. Made around 1900, it is composed of 13,260 pieces of
delicately patterned cotton cloth. Flickering light plays across the
main body of the quilt, which is constructed of tiny triangles. The
borders, made of larger rectangles, anchor the composition with
graphic clarity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a textile triumph," Fox says, but she doesn't describe it in
terms of painting. "I don't consider quilts painterly. I consider
them as quilts," she says. "There's a certain vocabulary of design
that quilters use." In this case, the composition is a precursor to
the "broken dishes" pattern that became a fad in the early 20th
century.</TE>
<TE>   A completely different approach to textile art appears in "Cowboys
Quilt," displayed in a section on western motifs. It's composed of 24
pictures of cowboys on horses, traced from covers of western
magazines and re-created in cloth. Assembled as a picture gallery,
the rectangular illustrations are presented in neat rows bordered by
gold sateen.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another odd example of needlework, "Hollywood Bedcover,"
appears in the final section. At first, it looks like a pastiche of
figurative line drawings in blue ink, but it's actually an
embroidered tribute to 205 Hollywood celebrities. Made by an unknown
artist around 1931, it seems to be the work of "a star-struck fan,"
Fox says, noting that the images are based on movie posters and
stills.</TE>
<TE>   Summing up the exhibition, Fox says the stories behind the quilts
are intriguing, but that wasn't her only criterion for selecting the
works. "Some quilts that have wonderful historic qualities don't have
aesthetic qualities, so those were not included," she says. "I try to
balance the historic with the aesthetic."</TE>

<HD>A Vacancy for L.A. Developers</HD>
<DH>Early bold plans for the city have given way to bottom-line
building. Ira Yellin was an exception; his death leaves us one less
visionary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the death of developer Ira Yellin this month, Los Angeles
architecture lost one of its most important advocates.</LD>
<LD>   As far back as the 1980s, when downtown Los Angeles was considered
by most an irrelevant urban wasteland, Yellin was one of the area's
most ardent boosters. His first major success was the refurbished
Grand Central Market, a cavernous food hall that has become a
communal focal point in downtown's old historic core. That was
followed by others, including the restoration of the Million Dollar
Theater, the Bradbury Building and Union Station--all significant
landmarks. Together, these projects were critical in reestablishing
downtown as a viable urban center.</LD>
<LD>   But if Yellin's career was an example of the pivotal role a
developer can play in mending a city's urban fabric, it also
underlined a more troubling reality: the pathetic quality of most
development in Los Angeles and elsewhere. In today's development
world, unrepentant city lovers like Yellin are the exception. They
have been replaced by an army of corporate hacks. The effect this
will have on the city's future is immeasurable.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps more than any other American city, Los Angeles' urban
identity was shaped by the moxie of its real estate developers. Its
vast tracts of semiarid desert land were seen as ripe for an endless
range of suburban fantasies, from the car-inspired aesthetic of A.W.
Ross' Miracle Mile to the theme-park canals of Abbot Kinney's Venice
and Sid Grauman's theatrical excesses.</TE>
<TE>   Such developers transformed Los Angeles into one of the world's
most radical urban visions, the first postindustrial city,
precariously balanced between fantasy and reality.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the number of urban visionaries working in Los Angeles can
be counted on one hand. In the 1980s, the development team of Robert
Maguire and James Thomas sought to raise the architectural standards
of conventional development in Los Angeles. Their 1980 proposal for
the redevelopment of Grand Avenue--a vibrant mix of architectural
styles and public spaces--was an inspired attempt to invigorate the
area's moribund street life. But the partners lacked the political
muscle to get it built.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Maguire has been working on a large commercial
parcel that is part of the controversial Playa Vista development. The
project--at the edge of the Ballona Wetlands--has understandably
raised the hackles of environmentalists, but at least Maguire's
portion rises to a higher architectural standard than the norm.</TE>
<TE>   Another local developer with a more nostalgic sense for the
theatrical is Tom Gilmore, who has been steadily renovating a
collection of 1920s-era downtown landmarks, including the Palace
Theater and the former St. Vibiana's Cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   The most visible player on Los Angeles' development scene,
however, is former real estate magnate Eli Broad. Strictly speaking,
Broad is no longer a developer, but he has brokered a number of deals
that have left a lasting impact on the city's architecture. In the
late 1990s, he coordinated a major fund-raising drive that
resurrected construction on Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall.
More recently, he worked with Caltrans on the Morphosis-designed
District 7 Headquarters Building in downtown. There, Broad
strong-armed contractors to reduce their fees and even pitched in
money of his own to ensure a higher level of design.</TE>
<TE>   To many architects, working with developers such as Broad is a
Faustian bargain. Architects crave the opportunities that such a
partnership can provide; they also resent the degree to which many
such developers insist on meddling.</TE>
<TE>   But architecture has always been an impure art. As sculptor
Richard Serra recently noted, what distinguishes artists from
architects is that architects have to worry about the plumbing. They
must also contend with an existing social context, rival political
forces and the sometimes mundane, bottom-line needs of their clients.
The ability to resolve such conflicts into a cohesive vision, in
fact, is exactly what makes architecture such a heroic endeavor.</TE>
<TE>   The real issue, therefore, is not the fact that developers exist.
It is that the fundamental character of the typical developer has
changed. The audacious visionary of the 1920s is a thing of the past.
Today's equivalent is usually a corporate bean counter--one whose
only real interest is how to create a maximum profit at minimum risk.
Such developers are apt to be oblivious to the things that make Los
Angeles a unique urban experiment. They rely on dull formulas that
add little of value to our urban existence.</TE>
<TE>   Examples of such projects are spreading over the city like a
fungus. The carpet of faux historical townhouses at Playa Vista,
grotesque urban malls such as Trizec Hahn's enormous Hollywood &amp;
Highland complex--these projects have contributed more to the city's
homogenization than to spark urban renewal. They are creations of an
emerging global monoculture, and they threaten to sap L.A. of its
mystique as a truly original urban organism.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin stood above such cynicism. His interest in reviving the
city's decrepit center began long before Broad and Gilmore began
proclaiming their faith in downtown's latest resurrection.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout most of his career, Yellin seemed more intent on mining
L.A.'s architectural past than on creating new visions for the
future. Restored in the late 1980s, the 1893 Bradbury Building's
ornate interior hall--laced with ironwork detailing--makes it one of
the city's most celebrated landmarks. Yellin's restored Million
Dollar Theater building, built in 1918, holds a significant place in
the city's history. It was Sid Grauman's first theater, and its top
floor served as the headquarters of the Department of Water and Power
during the days of William Mulholland.</TE>
<TE>   To Yellin, such projects were about more than fetishizing the
past. They represented a retrieval of lost historical memories.
Together with more public projects such as the Grand Central Market,
they contributed to the kind of social and cultural infrastructure
that the city always seemed to lack.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Yellin and his business partner, Dan Rosenfeld, had
begun to venture into new architectural territory. Yellin encouraged
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony to launch an international competition to
select an architect for the design of the new Cathedral of Our Lady
of the Angels. His firm worked with Morphosis in developing the
winning proposal for the Caltrans District 7 Headquarters Building at
1st and Main streets downtown. The building's faceted perforated
metal facade and towering interior hall represent a radical reworking
of the conventional office building. It is currently under
construction. Working with the Miami designers Architectonica, the
firm also won a recent competition for a middle school, mixed-income
housing and retail complex set over an existing Red Line subway stop
at Wilshire Boulevard and Vermont Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   It is impossible to know where Yellin's curiosity would have led
him next had he survived his fight with cancer. What we do know is
that his stubborn desire to push his work beyond the boundaries of
conventional development was an invaluable asset in the struggle over
the city's urban future. It is now up to others to take up that
mantle.</TE>

<HD>Now, It's Only About the Dance, Not His Dancing</HD>
<DH>A San Francisco Ballet principal performer has removed his
slippers to choreograph 'Damned'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yuri Possokhov is a heartthrob San Francisco Ballet principal dancer
who, at 38, is beginning to think of choreography as a way of
extending his career.</LD>
<LD>   His "Damned," which the company will dance this week at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center, is only his second ballet. But at
least in his current hometown, it was called "the dance event of the
season." After its premiere in April, San Francisco Chronicle dance
critic Octavio Roca didn't hesitate to say it fulfills the promise of
Possokhov's first work for San Francisco Ballet, "Margrittomania,"
which won the Bay Area Isadora Duncan Award for outstanding
choreography in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   "Possokhov has choreographed great roles in his 'Damned,' meaty
parts in which real dancers can create truth on stage," Roca wrote.
"New dramatic ballets are hard to come by, and choreographers who
make great ones are very rare indeed. Yuri Possokhov is such a man."</LD>
<TE>   The dancer-choreographer has so far never performed in "Damned"
and won't here. He creates for others, not for himself, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to see other people on stage," Possokhov said from San
Francisco after a recent company class. "If I were dancing in it,
people would be thinking about me as a dancer and a choreographer
instead of thinking about the performance. I think it's much better
just to create choreography and leave the dancing to somebody else.
In my mind, one plus the other doesn't give a double plus. It gives a
minus."</TE>
<TE>   "Damned" is a farewell tribute to his colleague and frequent
partner, Joanna Berman, who retired from the San Francisco Ballet
after 14 years as a principal dancer at the end of last season. But
other company dancers--Lorena Feijoo and Muriel Maffre--danced it
too, and they are the ones scheduled to dance the work in Orange
County in its first performances outside the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Possokhov says he was inspired by a controversial 1988
modern-dress television version of the Greek tragedy "Medea" by
Danish director Lars von Trier, whose "Breaking the Waves" was the
1996 Cannes Grand Prix winner. He had freely adapted a script by Carl
Dreyer and Preben Thomsen that Dreyer never got to film himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be a perfect match for Joanna," said
Possokhov. "She is hugely versatile and the possibilities of what I
could choreograph on her seemed endless. She has great dramatic
capabilities and I wanted to bring those out in the work. This was a
parting gift to her."</TE>
<TE>   The story is based on Euripides' 5th century BC play about the
god-woman Medea who avenges the betrayal of her hero-husband Jason by
killing their two children and the princess bride he has taken for
his political advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "Greek plays are the most clear, without any extraneous elements,"
Possokhov said. "They express much more than do those with a lot more
stuff. They are role models of concise expression."</TE>
<TE>   But like Von Trier, Possokhov--and his collaborators, scenic and
costume designer Thyra Hartshorn, and lighting designer Kevin
Connaughton, avoided a strict historical approach and boiled down the
story to essential confrontational scenes. Because he feels the
ballet is not exactly the play, Possokhov calls it "Damned" to
indicate the spiritual state of the characters.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to evoke ancient Greek style, but I didn't try to
replicate it," he said. "We were going for something timeless. This
is one of the most emotionally interesting stories for me."</TE>
<TE>   The dance is about 30 minutes long and enlists three principals,
two children and a corps of 16 to tell the story--Jason with his new
bride, Medea reacting in rage but hiding her anger as she gives the
princess a poisoned robe that will kill her, Medea still not
assuaged, then killing her children, and Jason reacting in horror to
what his action had precipitated.</TE>
<TE>   The corps dancers, wearing white masks and flowing skirts, the
women in flesh-toned leotards and the men bare-chested, function as a
Greek chorus, observing the action, amplifying it and participating
in it. Medea wears a dramatic brown dress, Jason wears a red shirt
and grayish pants, and his princess wife wears a peach-colored tunic.</TE>
<TE>   Possokhov, who was born in Lugansk, Ukraine, and trained at the
Moscow Ballet School, said he is drawn by training and inclination to
such narrative ballets. He danced mostly major story ballet roles for
10 years with the Bolshoi Ballet before joining the Royal Danish
Ballet in 1992, which is where Dane Helgi Tomasson met him in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Tomasson, who had taken over the San Francisco Ballet in 1985, was
setting his production of "A Sleeping Beauty" on the Danish company.
He invited Possokhov to California to dance in a gala. In 1994,
Possokhov joined the company as a principal dancer and moved to San
Francisco with his wife, Anna, and his son Daniel; his daughter,
Darya was born four years later.</TE>
<TE>   Other company dancers began asking him to create short solos they
could perform in competitions or add to their personal repertory, and
success in doing that encouraged him to create "Margrittomania," set
to music by Beethoven as arranged by Yuri Krasavin, for the full
company.</TE>
<TE>   For "Damned," he picked Ravel's Concerto for the Left Hand as the
main segment and framed it with the shorter "Pavane pour une infante
defunte," to both open and close the piece. The choice of the French
composer is not obvious. Ravel is generally regarded more for
elegance and sophistication of surface than for particularly dramatic
depths. But Possokhov disagrees with the general assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "Ravel is one of the more dramatic composers," Possokhov said.
"Some people regard him as art nouveau. I think the concerto is maybe
the most dramatic music I ever heard in my life."</TE>
<TE>   The ballet came together quickly over three weeks last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I came into the studio with some ideas in mind. I knew the ideas
and the structure, but I didn't have all the details. Because the
concerto is in one movement, I couldn't cut it. It had to be played
from the beginning to the end. I added the 'Pavane' to make the work
more dramatically complete."</TE>
<TE>   Although Possokhov isn't in "Damned," his fans won't be
disappointed. He will be seen in the title role of Lar Lubovitch's
full-length ballet, "Othello," later in the week.</TE>
<TE>   "Othello is one of my favorite roles in my 21-year career," he
said. "I still want to dance. I know that my body is not so pliable
as it used to be. I am not young anymore. I need to think more about
this. For me, it's a period of transition. I'm still dancing. Yet I
want to choreograph more because the more you do, the more
comfortable you feel doing it.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I like to combine dance and the dramatic reason I'm
doing it. You should act as well as dance, spreading your emotions
around. This kind of dance is my main nature, thanks to my teachers.
But I want to try the American style of ballet, which is more about
dancing than about a drama or a play.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to learn a lot about that. I've been inspired by Mark
Morris and James Kudelka, who just use music. I think that kind of
ballet expresses no less than dramatic ballets. I will try it and see
how it goes."</TE>

<HD>The Donnas Hitch Their Wagon to Some Clydesdales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With their last album, 2001's "Turn 21," Bay Area punk-metal
revivalists the Donnas reached the age when they could drink beer, at
least legally. In conjunction with the Oct. 22 release of a new
album, "Spend the Night," they'll be selling beer.</LD>
<LD>   The quartet will be featured in a radio ad as part of Budweiser's
"True Music" promotion. The spot will have excerpts from the band's
new single, "Take It Off," and group members chatting about what
music means to them.</LD>
<LD>   "I would much rather have them use our song and have models, or
guys jumping around at a party or something," says guitarist Allison
Robertson, a.k.a. Donna R.</LD>
<TE>   She may be a bit sheepish about it, but it all comes with the
official music-business maturing of the band.</TE>
<TE>   The four Donnas started at 14 with music and stance that took
equally from the Ramones and Motley Crue. With four albums since 1998
on small, Berkeley-based Lookout Records, the Donnas are now on major
Atlantic Records with the goal of widening their exposure and
audience.</TE>
<TE>   They've been in commercials before. Two songs have been used in TV
ads for Target stores and another is in a current Sprite TV campaign.
But Atlantic, part of AOL Time Warner, is setting their sights higher
now.</TE>
<TE>   "We sat with the band and talked about our ability to co-opt all
the relationships we have at every level of the business, from AOL to
the Budweiser deal to an Urban Outfitters tie-in to securing them a
consistent run of major tours," Atlantic Co-President Craig Kallman
says.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson, though, stresses that Atlantic is imposing nothing on
the band. "We had four albums on Lookout, a trillion songs before
that," she says. "We've been a band for nine years. It really was
about waiting until we had power before signing with a major. We care
about every detail. But you might have power, but your album might
not make it to the stores or you won't have [financial] tour support.
Labels like Lookout can't afford it."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to make the beer connection may well come under
scrutiny because the band was first known as a teen group and because
it's still four young women--not the usual spokespeople for beer.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a lot of kids at our shows, and it's not like they
don't know [beer] exists," Robertson says. "It's not like kids coming
to our shows are going, 'Oh my God! They drink Budweiser?' It's
different if you're telling kids to get drunk. But they know [beer]
exists."</TE>
<TE>   STAR POWER: Would you say no to Melanie Griffith and Penelope
Cruz? Elton John, Bob Dylan, Sting, Alanis Morissette and Ricky
Martin didn't. They're among the artists who contributed songs to an
upcoming album organized by the actresses to benefit the Sabera
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The charity works to rescue abandoned girls in Calcutta and
improve the health, education and status of women suffering from deep
poverty and cultural hostility.</TE>
<TE>   At the request of Griffith and Cruz, honorary presidents of the
effort's U.S. wing, Morissette delivered a new song, "Offer," while
Antonio Banderas, Griffith's husband, teamed with Spanish music stars
Alejandro Sanz and Vicente Amigo also recorded a new song, "La Aurora
de Nueva York." John, Dylan, Martin and others donated existing
tracks.</TE>
<TE>   On many of the songs, a chorus made up of girls who are receiving
health care and education from the foundation was added. Griffith and
her sister, Tracy, also sing a new song, "Cross Our Hearts," with the
chorus.</TE>
<TE>   Miles Copeland, chairman of Ark 21 Records, also couldn't say no
to Griffith, and is releasing the album in the U.S. on Nov. 19.</TE>
<TE>   "Melanie called and gave me the whole story, and it's up my street
in that it's a part of the world I'm interested in," says Copeland,
who grew up in the Middle East and managed the Police when they
became the first major Western group to perform in India.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike many charity albums, the artists have had some level of
proactive participation," says Copeland. "A lot of artists did new
songs or donated unused tracks or allowed the tracks to be altered
with the girls to make it special. Ricky Martin went all the way to
Calcutta to see the need for himself."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: John Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls has written and
recorded two new songs for "Treasure Planet," Disney's animated
retelling of "Treasure Island" in space. Rzeznik's songs "I'm Still
Here" and "Always Know Where You Are" will be heard in the movie,
while versions by British band BBMak (which records for Disney's
Hollywood Records label) will be on the soundtrack album due Nov. 17.
Meanwhile, the Goo Goo Dolls are filming an appearance on "Sabrina
the Teenage Witch," playing themselves and performing the song "Big
Machine" for an episode tentatively scheduled to air Nov. 1 ....</TE>
<TE>   In what Warner Bros. executives are calling a labor of love, the
company has taken over distribution of "1 Giant Leap," an album and
documentary project of cross-cultural collaborations. Among the
tracks on the collection, originally released earlier this year by
Chris Blackwell's Palm Pictures, are a song pairing R.E.M.'s Michael
Stipe with Indian film vocalist Asha Bhosle and another with Robbie
Williams and Maxi Jazz. Other featured singers include Baaba Maal,
Michael Franti, Speech and Neneh Cherry. Plans are being developed to
give the project a new promotional push.</TE>

<LD>   RYAN ADAMS</LD>
<LD>   "Demolition"</LD>
<TE>   Lost Highway</TE>
<TE>   Rather than release the four (!) albums he has on the shelf, Adams
placed what are presumably their 13 best songs on "Demolition" (due
in stores Tuesday). The move had its risks, because the works were
recorded at different times with different musicians and frequently
with different emotional tones in mind. But remarkably, the competing
elements blend together so well that this may be Adams' most
immediately appealing and consistent album.</TE>
<TE>   Where his two earlier solo albums tended to focus on specific
sides of his music, this celebrates all of them, and makes him seem
more interesting and human in the process. The music benefits from
the intimate nature of the recordings, which are little more than the
demo tapes an artist makes before going into the studio and putting
on the final polish. Adams, nominated by many critics and fellow
musicians last year as the young singer-songwriter of the day, has
never sounded so free vocally or more consistently heartfelt as a
writer.</TE>
<TE>   The North Carolinian's themes range from desolation to desire, and
the musical shading shifts from harmonica-driven folk-rock
("Hallelujah") and bittersweet pop ("Cry on Demand") to dark, fearful
blues ("Jesus: Don't Touch My Baby") and the rousing barroom
country-rock that the Rolling Stones learned from Gram Parsons ("Chin
Up, Cheer Up").</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, he's the helpless romantic, reflecting the ups and
downs of that role--nowhere better than in "Hallelujah," where he
speaks of being a "desperate man" sheltered only by "a lonely dream,"
and "Cry on Demand," where he admits tenderly, "The truth is I miss
you." Adams plays L.A.'s Wiltern Theatre on Oct. 23.</TE>
<TE>   --Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   UNDERWORLD</TE>
<TE>   "A Hundred Days Off"</TE>
<TE>   V2</TE>
<TE>   With the 1999 departure of DJ and producer Darren Emerson,
Underworld's Rick Smith and Karl Hyde faced the question of whether
they could maintain their relevance. While Hyde and Smith have a pop
sensibility, Emerson brought the dance aspect to the table, and it
was when those two elements combined that Underworld became
electronic music royalty.</TE>
<TE>   The first studio recording (due Tuesday) from Smith and Hyde since
Emerson's exodus answers the relevance question quickly. "Two Months
Off," the album's lead single, is a club smash, and with good reason.
Vintage Underworld a la the hit "Born Slippy," the song features a
pulsating bass line, synthesizers and a vocal refrain that all rise
together to a fever pitch.</TE>
<TE>   The percussive "Dinosaur Adventure 3D" is another dance-floor
barnburner. But aside from those two tracks, much of "A Hundred Days
Off" is subtler, as in the samba flavorings of the instrumental
"Twist," the whispered vocals of the acid jazz "Little Speaker" and
the elegant strings of "Ballet Lane." Underworld (which plays the
Wiltern Theatre on Oct. 21) has always known how to throw down a
beat, but what's distinguished the band from the rest of the
electronic field is its ability to do it smartly and with a nod to
other genres. That is still intact on "A Hundred Days Off," and as
long as it is, Underworld will remain unquestionably relevant.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   PETER GABRIEL</TE>
<TE>   "Up"</TE>
<TE>   Geffen/Real World</TE>
<TE>   In a 180-degree swing from the party-rock frippery that made
"Sledgehammer" ubiquitous on MTV,   Gabriel makes a refreshing return
to the contemplative, incandescent work of his late-'70s solo albums.
The opening track, "Darkness," charged with fits of noise and
Gabriel's most hushed and introspective lyrics, makes it clear that
"Up" refers here not to an emotional state, but to vertical movements
in and out of this life--to birth and death.</TE>
<TE>   Although "I Grieve" descends into the morose and "The Barry
Williams Show," a bizarre rumination on Springer-style trash TV, is a
throwaway, other tracks, such as "More Than This," channel more
successfully the theatrical experiments of Gabriel's legendary
proto-prog years with Genesis (especially the vocal treatments).</TE>
<TE>   The entire album (in stores Tuesday) is elevated by "Signal to
Noise," an intelligent and moving struggle for moral clarity in a
universe of media overkill, hitting with the resonance of "Games
Without Frontiers" or "No Self Control," and touched with short
bursts of the inspired qawwali incantations of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.
The quiet piano end piece, "The Drop," is like a lost parenthetical
from "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway." Ten years since the saccharine
pop of "Us," Gabriel arrives right on time with a touchstone for the
seeking spirit of the day.</TE>
<TE>   --Dean Kuipers</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   JACKSON BROWNE</TE>
<TE>   "The Naked Ride Home"</TE>
<TE>   Elektra</TE>
<TE>   Browne watchers have had to find their rewards where they can
since those days in the '70s when the quintessential L.A.
singer-songwriter put out album after album brimming with eloquent
songs from and to the human heart.</TE>
<TE>   His first new album in six years (due Tuesday) provides one of
those rewards in the title song, a rumination on the difference
between outer and inner beauty as moving and finely crafted as the
best songs from his "For Everyman" and "Late for the Sky" artistic
peak.</TE>
<TE>   It's followed by the first single, "The Night Inside Me," a strong
rocker about the ongoing struggle to live an authentic life. Then the
album nose-dives into the clumsy geopolitics that have been the bane
of his albums for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   As much as he yearns to be Bob Dylan, Browne has rarely been able
to make his views on the world situation personally compelling. He
doesn't come close in "Casino Nation" or "Walking Town," which miss
by a country mile the difference between one person struggling to map
out his place in the world (as he once did in "The Pretender") and
lecturing others about theirs.</TE>
<TE>   Things turn around again at album's end with the meditative
rock-gospel number, "Don't You Want to Be There," benefiting from
Daniel Lanois-like production atmospherics, and the closing treatise
on unexpectedly finding new love, "My Stunning Mystery Companion."</TE>
<TE>   --Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Sahara Hotnights, "Jennie Bomb," Jetset. Better watch your
back, Joan Jett ... er, Siouxsie ... um, Babes in Toyland ... ah,
Elastica. Here come Sahara Hotnights, riding the Swedish tsunami and
placing their trendy skater sneakers squarely in the footprints of
their female-rock forebears. What this foursome's U.S. debut lacks in
range and depth, it recompenses with energy, its sassy guitars
buzzing with digestible melodies and sprinting breathlessly toward
called-out choruses. Never confrontational enough that they aren't
sexy and never heady enough that you forget you're here to party,
Sahara Hotnights offer visceral rewards based on one principle: Waste
no time between hooks. (The band performs Wednesday at the Roxy in
West Hollywood.)</TE>

<LD>Johnny Cash turned 70 on Feb. 26 and it's nice that a lot of artists,
from Bob Dylan to Bruce Springsteen, are saluting this giant of
American pop culture in tribute albums. But I can't imagine putting
money in a jukebox to hear almost any of them. The Cash originals,
however? Anyone got change for a five?</LD>
<LD>   ** 1/2 Various artists, "Kindred Spirits: A Tribute to the Songs
of Johnny Cash," Sony Nashville. This 14-track package, which arrives
in stores Tuesday, illustrates the extremes of tribute albums. Some
artists--Dylan, Springsteen, Keb Mo--rework the original songs so
aggressively that they sound like, well, Dylan, Springsteen and Keb
Mo tracks. Others--Hank Williams Jr. and Marty Stuart--try to
duplicate the spirit of Cash's versions. Both are interesting, but
only fleetingly.</LD>
<LD>   ** Various artists, "Dressed in Black: A Tribute to Johnny Cash,"
Dualtone. Most of the participants in this alt-artist package
(including Hank Williams III, Rosie Flores and Dale Watson Knight)
lean toward chasing the Cash spirit--and they do a reasonable job.
The highlight: Earl Poole Ball's version of "I Still Miss Someone,"
boldly substituting piano for Cash's classic guitar-driven sound.</LD>
<TE>   **** Johnny Cash, "The Essential Johnny Cash," Columbia/Legacy.
From the rockabilly of "Big River" to the protest sounds of "The
Ballad of Ira Hayes" to the introspection of "Sunday Mornin' Comin'
Down," Cash's voice carries the character and command of an artist
whose ambition, dedication and integrity have set a standard of
excellence for almost a half century. There is no real substitute.</TE>

<LD>Nine days ago, members of the first L.A. cast of composer-lyricist
Stephen Sondheim's first full-length musical, "Saturday Night,"
gathered in the Valley Glen living room of the producer, Eileen
Barnett, for a potluck dinner and an initial reading of the script.</LD>
<LD>   The five dogs who live in the house licked director Michael
Michetti's face in between scenes and barked loudly whenever a
latecomer showed up at the front door. A few cast members weren't
there, for this was not a required rehearsal. Those were scheduled to
begin last Friday--three days before show time.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, "Saturday Night" will make its L.A. debut Monday night, at
the Pasadena Playhouse, after only four rehearsals of about five
hours each.</LD>
<TE>   That's the amount of rehearsal that Actors' Equity allows for the
producing organization, Musical Theatre Guild, to get its act
together. Its act is a staged reading, not a fully mounted
production. On Monday, the actors will carry scripts during the
dialogue passages but are expected to drop them for the musical
numbers. To save rehearsal time, a number that normally would be
danced by two actors will be performed by two dancers hired just for
that number.</TE>
<TE>   "A show takes as long to get up as you have to rehearse it," said
the show's musical director, Nick DeGregorio, while stationed at the
upright piano in Barnett's home during a break halfway through the
reading.</TE>
<TE>   DeGregorio tries to schedule an additional half-hour alone with
each singing actor away from the rehearsals. But time constraints
don't bother him. Guild members "are mind readers," he said. "You
give them a concept, they run with it."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the guild's regular actor-members are such veterans that
for "Saturday Night"--in which most of the characters are about 20
years old--the guild had to recruit outside its ranks more than
usual. Some of the guild's relatively few members who look the right
age were busy on other jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Michetti told the cast at the reading that "many of you
are somewhere between three and 15 years too old for these roles."
Amid general laughter, he added, "If these are a bunch of losers in
their 30s and 40s, it's a different story altogether." Sondheim
himself was only 24 when the musical, about young and unsettled
Brooklynites in 1929, was first scheduled to be produced in 1954.
That production was canceled after the death of producer Lemuel
Ayers, but the show finally received its premiere in London in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Musical Theatre Guild occupies one of the most distinctive
niches in L.A. theater. Not only is its programming highly unusual,
but its co-op-style structure is otherwise unknown among L.A.
companies that operate above the 99-seat level.</TE>
<TE>   First, the programming. Most of the guild's shows are obscure
musicals that presumably have been seen by only a minuscule number of
people in L.A. (among the titles: "Colette Collage," "Louisiana
Purchase," "The Rink," "I Remember Mama," "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"
"How Now, Dow Jones?"). Generally, the guild presents them for only
one night, in a staged reading at the Pasadena Playhouse. The company
has 305 season subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Besides "Saturday Night," the upcoming season includes Rodgers &amp;
Hammerstein's "Allegro" and Cole Porter's "Jubilee!," as well as
"Lucky Stiff" and "Grand Hotel," both of which received a single
production in L.A. in the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a huge inventory of shows that did well at first but
never became classics," said guild board chairman Alan Weston.</TE>
<TE>   The only other group in town that tries anything similar,
Reprise!, rarely picks shows as unfamiliar as the guild's. It has
done "1776" and "Hair," and its current "Anything Goes" is a show
that's often seen at civic light operas. Reprise! also abandoned the
staged-reading format soon after it began and runs its shows for two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Reprise! producing artistic director Marcia Seligson saw
the guild's production of Sondheim's "Passion"--even now, the only
professional staging of this Tony-winning musical in the L.A.
area--and picked it up for one additional performance at UCLA, as a
benefit for both groups. It was the only time a guild show was staged
more than once.</TE>
<TE>   This year, however, Reprise! appeared to be trying to steal some
of the "Saturday Night" fever when the bigger group announced, just
three weeks ago, that it will host a benefit concert reading of
Sondheim's "Merrily We Roll Along" at UCLA's Freud Playhouse on
Monday, the same night that "Saturday Night" will play Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Barnett, co-producer of "Saturday Night," said the conflict
was "a little distressing" and that a guild board member "sent out a
panicky e-mail." However, "I can't imagine they were trying to
compete," she said. "I'm assuming they just didn't think about us."
She expressed confidence that true Sondheimaniacs will choose
"Saturday Night" because of its relative unfamiliarity ("Merrily" was
produced in L.A. two years ago, by the West Coast Ensemble).</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Seligson said she hadn't known about the "Saturday
Night" production, but "even if I had known, it wouldn't have stopped
us. I don't think our Westside audience is their Pasadena audience."
As for Sondheim fans who are tearing out their hair, "they'll just
have to choose."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, there is another alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Musical Theatre Guild is about to expand ever so slightly.
Following the Pasadena performance Monday, the "Saturday Night" team
will regroup Oct. 20 for two Sunday performances at Thousand Oaks
Civic Arts Plaza's 390-seat Scherr Forum. "Grand Hotel" will do
likewise, playing in Pasadena on Feb. 3 and twice in Thousand Oaks on
March 9.</TE>
<TE>   The Thousand Oaks venue is contributing its facilities and
technical assistance, and the two groups will divide the proceeds,
said Tom Mitze, director of the Thousand Oaks theaters. He hopes to
develop in his audience a taste for less familiar musicals, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In another sign of cautious expansion, the guild's "Allegro" in
November will be performed at the Alex Theatre in Glendale, twice as
big as the Pasadena Playhouse, because the playhouse's stage will be
altered for another production in a way that wouldn't meet the
guild's needs.</TE>
<TE>   Like most decisions at the guild, the venue arrangements are
handled by the actor-members. The 60 members, who each pay $15 in
monthly dues, control every creative aspect and many of the
managerial tasks. There is no artistic director or producer.</TE>
<TE>   True, the group has a board of directors--more than half of whom
are not actor-members. The board raises money, serves as the legal
overseer for nonprofit purposes and pitches in on projects. But the
shows are picked by an elected executive committee of five members,
two of whom organize the agenda for three months before those
responsibilities are rotated to one or two others.</TE>
<TE>   New members are picked by existing members, with attempts made to
provide a balance of men and women, different ages, leading actors
and character actors, and--most recently, with the recruitment of
four new African American members--races.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the lower costs and reduced box office pressures of
only partially staged one-nighters may explain why the group can
operate without ongoing central leadership--and why it's able to
indulge in esoteric programming.</TE>
<TE>   The communal model wasn't always in force. The group was founded
seven years ago by Jeff Rizzo and Eric Andrist, who invited friends
to do living-room readings of shows. For the first few years, Rizzo
and Andrist did much of the work and assumed the position of
producers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, however, the two left after discontent spread about their
leadership style. In the wake of their exit, the group reorganized
with strictly egalitarian guidelines. To this day, said Teri Ralston,
one of the founding members, "we fear so much having one person
become too powerful."</TE>
<TE>   Expansion plans may eventually force a rethinking of that
position. Ralston, co-chairwoman of the group's expansion committee,
said that ideally the company will not only thrive at Thousand Oaks
and export all of its productions there, but also come up with one
other venue, in a different area such as Long Beach or Palos Verdes,
for similar treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairman Weston, who lives in Santa Monica, said he'd like
to develop a Westside audience for the guild--in the heart of
Reprise! territory.</TE>
<TE>   The company has already developed a show that tours schools under
the auspices of the Music Center. Even never-produced musicals are
not out of the question--a recent guild reading focused on an
unproduced Billy Barnes musical.</TE>
<TE>   Guild members occasionally discuss the pros and cons of moving a
show to a full production in a 99-seat theater. But Weston said he
doubts that the Equity actors, who receive a total of $260 each for
the rehearsals and three performances, would want to step backward in
compensation (actors in 99-seat shows seldom receive anything for
rehearsals and no more than $15 per performance). He also believes
that most of the guild's shows were written for larger venues.</TE>
<TE>   Weston recalled that only 40 people were in the audience for the
company's first production. "I thought we'd go broke before we got
past the first show," he said. Now the audience is usually in the
range of 400 to 500. "People think, 'How can this be good if they're
carrying scripts?' But after five minutes, you don't notice the
scripts."</TE>
<TE>   Still, everyone in the guild appears to recognize that growth must
be carefully monitored. "The whole idea is not to do what everybody
else is doing," Weston said. "Granted, our shows aren't going to
appeal to everyone, but we don't have to fill a big theater for two
or three weeks."</TE>

<HD>Herbie Hancock Heads a Quintet of Pianists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fairly convincing case can be made for Herbie Hancock as the most
influential jazz pianist-composer of the past few decades. His
impact--in terms of harmonic innovations as a pianist and
stylistically omnivorous compositional advances--has been widely
felt.</LD>
<LD>   Paradoxically, one could also suggest that the very restlessness
of his musical imagination, his seeming lack of desire to remain in
any single mode for an extended period of time, has both expanded the
breadth of his influence while, perhaps, diminishing the fullness of
what might have been produced by a more focused creative vision.</LD>
<LD>   Still, in less capable hands, Hancock's sudden shifts from
acoustic to electric, from recollections of the '60s and cutting-edge
duets with Wayne Shorter to pop music crossovers, could have had far
less consequential results. Regardless of what might have been, his
eclectic productivity has proved a boon to his record labels and his
many, all-accepting fans.</LD>
<TE>   Most of what is in "The Herbie Hancock Box" (****, Columbia
Legacy) has been released earlier in one form or another, although
some tracks have only been issued in Japan. But the package, which
samples 25 albums from a 17-year period beginning in 1976, provides
an overview of the 62-year-old artist's remarkable efforts during an
era of dramatically shifting currents in jazz and pop music.</TE>
<TE>   The CDs are thematically structured. The first two are largely
dedicated to acoustic performances with VSOP, Chick Corea, Ron Carter
and Tony Williams. The third CD dips into Hancock's electric efforts
from albums such as "Headhunters," "Death Wish," "Manchild," etc. And
the fourth CD focuses on such crossover releases as "Future Shock,"
"Mr. Hands" and "Dedication."</TE>
<TE>   The collection is a remarkable chronicle of a compelling musical
mind. Whatever favorites one might have, the quality levels--in terms
of concept and performance--are universally high.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not convinced, however, that organizing the collection
thematically rather than chronologically was the wisest decision. It
would have been far more interesting to hear the projects in
sequence, to hear whatever linkages might exist, elusive though they
may be, among Hancock's shifting musical perspectives.</TE>
<TE>   Several other first-rate pianists have current albums in release.
Andrew Hill, 65, is a slightly older contemporary of Hancock's. But,
despite his considerable talents, he has never commanded comparable
audience attention. Like Hancock, Hill has always insisted on
following his own musical path, often darting into unexpected byways.
"A Beautiful Day" (*** 1/2, Palmetto Records) offers a vivid portrait
of Hill's intensely personal viewpoint. Composing for an ensemble
comparable to a big jazz band, he has produced a collection that
brilliantly integrates solos in the fabric of the full ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Hill's willingness to let his players boldly improvise--lurking,
blending and battling with the composed sections--makes for
extraordinary music. Good examples: John Savage's flute and Marty
Ehrlich's bass clarinet on "Faded Beauty"; the use of Jose D'Avila's
roving tuba as an organizing element, especially in passages with
unusual meters.</TE>
<TE>   At 27, Jason Moran has miles to go before he reaches Hancock or
Hill's level of maturity. But his solo performances on "Modernistic"
(*** 1/2, Blue Note) suggest that he is headed in the right
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Grasping a large chunk of music history, Moran performs works by
stride pianist-composer James P. Johnson ("You've Got to Be
Modernistic"), classical composer Robert Schumann (the song "Auf
Einer Burg") and Afrika Bambaata (the rap classic "Planet Rock"). Add
to that a pair of Moran originals, "Gangsterism on Irons" and
"Gangsterism on a Lunch Table" (continuing entries in a series of
works based on Andrew Hill's "Erato"), and an idiosyncratic rendering
of the standard "Body and Soul," and you've got a program demanding
enough to challenge the most mature pianist.</TE>
<TE>   Moran handles everything superbly, enlivening some tracks with
manipulated piano sounds that John Cage would surely have loved, and
tossing in some pre-recorded overlays, as well. But at the heart of
everything is a remarkably contained and focused musical imagination.
Already a major talent, Moran gets better and better with every
outing.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian-born pianist Eliane Elias, 42, has been on the scene for
a good 15 years without ever quite breaking through in the fashion
her abilities clearly deserve. In recent outings, she occasionally
has begun to add some soft, sensual vocalizing to her piano
work--almost always with good results. In "Kissed by Nature" (***,
RCA/BMG), she expands the presence of both her singing and composing,
opening the very real possibility of a breakout from the instrumental
arena. That's not to say that her piano work isn't first-rate; it is.
But the real appeal of the album lies in tunes such as the title
track, "A Volta" and, especially, the spirited rhythms of
"Manhattan," a song with real crossover potential. And for once, some
remixes (by BossaCucaNova) offer effective, pop-market
transformations without the loss of musical content.</TE>
<TE>   Mulgrew Miller has been producing quality work since the '80s,
initially with such artists as Betty Carter, Art Blakey's Jazz
Messengers and the Tony Williams Quintet. The mainstream foundation
of those settings fully explain why the pianist's efforts as a leader
have been so firmly driven by straight-ahead swing enhanced by
sprinklings of edgy adventurousness.</TE>
<TE>   In the liner notes for "The Sequel" (***, MaxJazz), his first
outing as a leader in seven years, Miller notes that he wanted to
make "music that was less cluttered ... that emphasized the dance in
the swing beat."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 47, accomplishes that through a group of compositions that
are melodic and accessible, firmly rooted in the music of the '50s
and '60s, with occasional traces of dissonance. The context feels
just right for him. Often described as a musical offspring of McCoy
Tyner, Miller's style reaches back earlier, to the solid, dependable,
bop-based efforts of players such Wynton Kelly, Tommy Flanagan and
Hank Jones. Those qualities are especially apparent in the album's
two standout tracks: Henry Mancini's "Dreamsville," performed as a
duet with soprano saxophonist Steve Wilson, and Rodgers &amp; Hart's
classic ballad "It Never Entered My Mind," offered as a trio, with
bassist Richie Goods and drummer Karriem Riggins.</TE>

<HD>A Call to Arms for the State's Eccentrics</HD>
<DH>California is woefully lacking in its share of Guinness
record holders. Where are our long-distance tap-dancers and 4-inch
ear hairs?</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to bizarre world records, California is losing its
touch. Its dinosaur vomit isn't old enough, its motorized sofas
aren't speedy enough and its giant carrots aren't massive enough.</LD>
<LD>   Although the state still lays claim to the world's largest disco
ball, the steepest skydive by a dog and the most soap bubbles blown
by someone with a live tarantula in his mouth, something is clearly
amiss.</LD>
<LD>   According to statistics compiled for Guinness World Records 2003,
California ranks first in the nation in total world records (290) but
falls to an embarrassing 14th in records as a percentage of state
population. Whereas New York has one Guinness record for every 82,500
residents, California has only one record for every 117,000 people.</LD>
<TE>   The current champion of Guinness records on a per-capita basis is
... the District of Columbia, which possesses one record for every
17,300 residents.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just tickled to death," said Tony Bullock, spokesman for
Washington Mayor Anthony Williams. "We'll take any distinction we can
get, especially positive ones. And we do consider this positive."</TE>
<TE>   The District of Columbia's claims to fame include the biggest map
collection (at the Library of Congress), largest antiwar rally
(600,000 people in November 1969), most fan mail for a cat (75,000
letters a week for former White House feline Socks), most varieties
of beer sold commercially (1,072 at the Brickskeller) and highest
concentration of corrupt windbags in one place (U.S. Congress).
Actually, that last category isn't officially recognized, but it's
still a record. The District is also home to the woman with the
world's largest natural breasts, size 48V, according to Guinness.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say I have any firsthand knowledge of that one," Bullock
said.</TE>
<TE>   How did Washington amass such a high percentage of records?
Guinness officials say many of the marks are politics-related. But
Bullock offered another theory: "This city attracts people from all
over the world, and with that tremendous diversity comes an unnatural
amount of talents."</TE>
<TE>   The second-best Guinness showing belongs to Alaska, home of the
world's largest carrot (18 pounds, 13 ounces) and fastest-moving
glacier. A spokesman for Gov. Tony Knowles said the state has no
plans to try to overtake Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if we could compete with the District of Columbia
because their categories are so different," said gubernatorial press
secretary Bob King. "Alaska is famous for its arctic conditions,
whereas Washington is known for its hot air."</TE>
<TE>   Third-place finisher Hawaii (heaviest professional sumo wrestler,
largest active volcano, biggest aloha shirt) attributed its strong
performance to "something in our clean air." Gov. Benjamin Cayetano
said: "It's the clean, fresh air that Los Angeles once had 200 years
ago."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but Hawaii must remain vigilant to hang onto third
place. Tenth-place New York recently pilfered the island state's
record for largest ice cream scoop pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Sacramento, Gov. Gray Davis seems shockingly
unperturbed by California's feeble Guinness output. "We have the
fifth-largest economy in the world, the strongest environmental laws
in the nation and some of the most magnificent coastlines you can
find anywhere," said Davis spokeswoman Jordan Rasmussen. "That makes
California No. 1 in our eyes. And some records aren't worth
breaking."</TE>
<TE>   If Davis' Republican opponent, Bill Simon, has a plan to rally the
citizenry to boost California's world records, he isn't sharing it.
His campaign didn't return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   But, clearly, the situation calls for action. Even puny New
Hampshire has more Guinness records per capita than California. That
state's landmarks include longest candy counter (112 feet), most
jack-o'-lanterns in one place (23,727 at a pumpkin festival held two
years ago) and most people wearing fake Groucho glasses and mustache
simultaneously (522). New Hampshire also boasts the third-largest
legislature in the English-speaking world, with 424 members, trailing
only the British Parliament and Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no state policy on getting into the book of Guinness
records, but we've got a long history of independent, adventurous
spirits, and I guess that's continuing today," said Pamela Walsh,
press secretary to New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be easy for California to claw its way to No. 1. Guinness
officials receive about 50,000 requests a year from aspiring
record-breakers. For California to be competitive, it must first
protect the records it already has, such as longest car (a 100-foot
limousine equipped with its own swimming pool and diving board); most
live honeybees held inside a human mouth (109); largest lemon (an
8.5-pound monstrosity grown in Whittier in 1983); largest drug
seizure (47,554 pounds of cocaine found in Sylmar in 1989); loudest
finger snap (108 decibels, by a Pasadena man); and longest distance
leapfrogged (996 miles by 14 Stanford students in 1991).</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, California must develop new records or steal existing
ones. A search of Guinness World Records 2003 and the Web site
www.guinnessworldrecords.com found dozens of feats vulnerable to
hostile takeover, including:</TE>
<TE>   * Most people flossing simultaneously with the same piece of floss
(297 people using a 1,500-foot string of dental floss, Illinois).</TE>
<TE>   * Fastest motorized sofa (87 mph, United Kingdom).</TE>
<TE>   * Longest time spent on a bed of nails (274 hours, Norway).</TE>
<TE>   * Most beer bottle caps removed with the teeth in one minute (56,
Texas).</TE>
<TE>   * Longest ear hair (4 inches, India).</TE>
<TE>   * Most clothespins clipped to a human face (133, United Kingdom).</TE>
<TE>   * Longest conga line (119,986 people, Florida).</TE>
<TE>   * Most telephone directories torn in half in three minutes (19,
Missouri).</TE>
<TE>   * Most balloon animals sculpted in one hour (494, Pennsylvania).</TE>
<TE>   Other records will be tougher to beat, but that doesn't mean the
state shouldn't try. For example, California could hire a team of
paleontologists to search for fossilized dinosaur barf older than
Britain's record-setting 160-million-year-old ichthyosaur vomit.</TE>
<TE>   State officials could also import some reptiles and try to break
the record for "most fatalities in a crocodile attack." According to
Guinness World Records 2003, the current title is held by a World War
II Japanese army unit that tried to escape British forces by crossing
10 miles of mangrove swamps on the Burmese island of Ramree.
Unfortunately for the Japanese, the swamps contained thousands of
15-foot saltwater crocodiles. Of the 1,000 soldiers who entered the
swamps, only 20 survived.</TE>
<TE>   Even the simplest records can be difficult to break, said Brian
Reinert, a publicist for Guinness' latest book. "There's a guy in
Australia who holds the record for most powdered doughnuts eaten in
three minutes without stopping for a drink or to lick your lips,"
Reinert said. "He ate six. It sounds easy, but I tried it and only
ate two. It's tough."</TE>
<TE>   Alabama can vouch for that. The Southern state is at the bottom of
the Guinness heap, with a paltry eight records, including world's
largest cake (128,238 pounds) and most accomplished human speed bump
(a Birmingham man who allowed himself to be run over by seven
consecutive trucks).</TE>
<TE>   Alabama's governor, Don Siegelman, was apparently too ashamed to
return a reporter's phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Barely ahead of Alabama was New Jersey, home to the world's
largest golf sand trap (slightly bigger than an acre), the largest
bottle (nearly 8 feet tall) and the longest distance tap-danced by a
man (32 miles in 7.5 hours). When asked for comment, a spokesman for
New Jersey Gov. James McGreevey said: "We're just glad we're not
Alabama."</TE>

<TE>   "Cook-a-Doodle-Doo" was a good story. The rooster was bored of
eating chicken and remembered what grandma said about the cooking
book. So the rooster decided to make a strawberry shortcake. It asked
the turtle, iguana and pig if they could help rooster make a cake.
They went to make the cake.</TE>

<TE>   by Gloria Whelan</TE>
<TE>   This story is about a girl named Koly, who lives in India and is
the only girl in her family. Her family arranges a marriage for her
when she is 12 years old. When the wedding day arrives, Hari, a small
13-year-old boy, becomes her husband. After the ceremony, Koly is not
allowed to see him. The boy's parents arranged the wedding so they
could get the girl's dowry and take him to a sacred temple. He dies
the next day. The girl is now a widow and has to stay with her
in-laws even though they treat her badly. If she goes home she will
dishonor her family.</TE>
<TE>   This book was exciting and sad at the same time.</TE>

<TE>   "Letters from Rifka"</TE>
<TE>   by Karen Hesse</TE>
<TE>   This book is about a girl named Rifka and how she tries to travel
to America with her family. She catches ringworm and has to wait to
go to America by herself, because her family leaves without her. She
then goes to America, but in the process she stays on Ellis Island
for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   The story only focused on Rifka, the main character. The
immigration process was probably bad for her, but other immigrants
may have had different perspectives.</TE>

<TE>   by Daniel Stashower</TE>
<TE>   We all watch a lot of TV, but did you ever wonder who invented TV?
TV was invented by a 14-year-old kid. No kidding! His name was Phil
Farnsworth. He was the boy genius who figured out how to take a
picture, break it down, transmit it, receive it, put it back together
and show it on the screen.</TE>

You can find this, and more, by reading this book.</TE>

<DH>On 'Stepford Wives' anniversary, Ira Levin is surprised by
his effect on popular culture</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's three decades now since the Welcome Wagon lady showed up at
Joanna Eberhart's door with her packets of powdered breakfast drink
and unrelenting smile. "It's a nice town with nice people!" she told
Joanna, who still had boxes in the living room. "And I want to wish
you a sincere and hearty welcome to Stepford."</LD>
<LD>   Well, we all know what happened next, don't we? How Joanna began
noticing that all the women in the suburban town were perfectly
coiffed and groomed and could not be pried from their housewifely
duties with a crowbar. How there were only two other women in town
who felt as she did--that the fenced-in Men's Assn. was a bastion of
chauvinism, that a dirty kitchen was the sign of a creative mind,
that the women in Stepford, with their slim waists and big breasts,
were just too perfect and really kind of weird.</LD>
<LD>   Then those two women changed overnight, finding sudden profound
happiness in a well-waxed floor and supportive undergarments and
Joanna was left all alone, with her husband and his creepy friends,
one of whom had worked--aha!--in the animatronics division at
Disneyland.</LD>
<TE>   Night-night, Joanna.</TE>
<TE>   Ira Levin says that when he published "The Stepford Wives" 30
years ago on Oct. 13, he was not attempting any sort of social
commentary, he was just trying to write a good thriller. A reference
in "Future Shock" to domestic robots had piqued his interest, and
then he happened across an article about the presidential animatrons
at Disneyland. Of course, he was going through a divorce while he
wrote the book, and that, he admitted at the time, might have colored
his view of domestic living a tiny bit. Then again, he had already
conjured up one of the worst literary marriages in the world five
years previously in the form of Guy and Rosemary, those well-matched
newlyweds of "Rosemary's Baby."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he says now, he was taken by surprise if not by how many
people read "The Stepford Wives" then by the way they read it: as a
critique of marriage, of suburban living, of feminism, of
anti-feminism, of housework, of men, of women, of American culture.</TE>
<TE>   "All that happened after publication," Levin says by phone from
his home in New York. "Really, it just started out of the
technology."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he says, he and his family lived in a small town in suburban
Connecticut for a while, "but none of the women there were Stepford
wives, and my wife at the time was certainly not a Stepford wife," he
adds with the sort of laugh often accompanied by a rueful stroke of
the chin. "A plot just makes its own demands."</TE>
<TE>   Stepford Everything</TE>
<TE>   For those who missed the book, there was the 1975 movie starring
the lovely Katharine Ross and Paula Prentiss. By the mid-'80s,
"Stepford wife" had become a part of the vernacular, a shorthand for
a woman who seemed enslaved to her oh-so-perfect home and children.
By the '90s "Stepford" was a free-standing antecedent, connoting
robotic or lock-step behavior. A Stepford executive, a Stepford
student, a Stepford salesclerk.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I hear someone use the term, I get a kick out of it,"
says Levin, 73. "I feel like I've contributed to the language."</TE>
<TE>   One could argue that he had already done that with "Rosemary's
Baby," a term occasionally applied to less-than-docile infants. (And,
certainly, no one who has ever read the book, or seen the movie, can
ever look at a chocolate mousse with the same level of carefree
anticipation.) But with that book, as with "The Stepford Wives" and
then "The Boys From Brazil," Levin did more than coin a few phrases
that look good in magazine headlines; he helped establish, and
legitimize, the horror thriller.</TE>
<TE>   And he sometimes wonders if that was such a good thing.
"Rosemary's Baby" also grew more from the creation of a plot
device--what better way to extend the delicious period of suspense
before the monster shows itself than by having it literally growing
inside someone--than any desire to explore the possibility of literal
evil in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel guilty that 'Rosemary's Baby' led to 'The Exorcist,' 'The
Omen' " he says. "A whole generation has been exposed, has more
belief in Satan. I don't believe in Satan. And I feel that the strong
fundamentalism we have would not be as strong if there hadn't been so
many of these books. Of course," he adds, with that laugh again, "I
didn't send back any of the royalty checks."</TE>
<TE>   His books are successful, he says, because his interests seem to
reflect the larger interests of society. "The Boys From Brazil" (in
which the infamous Dr. Mengele has cloned Adolf Hitler and farmed the
babies out to parents all over the world) sprung from a newspaper
article on cloning that used a photo of Hitler to illustrate the
obvious worst-case scenario.</TE>
<TE>   The books are also successful because Levin, who wrote "Deathtrap"
and many other plays, has that rare talent of creating a world so
real in its mundane details that when the extraordinary occurs, the
fabric of the story remains whole and believable, and, in most cases,
resistant to the passage of time.</TE>
<TE>   A lot has happened since Joanne Eberhart moved to Stepford. Last
year's census revealed that both parents work outside the home in
more than half of families with children younger than 17. There has
been a female secretary of state, if not yet a female president;
Condoleezza Rice is the national security advisor. Title IX paved the
way for the WNBA and the Williams sisters' domination of women's
tennis. "Women's Lib," a cause Joanna and her two pals believe in, at
least (cue chilling woodwinds) for a while, has been replaced by
"feminism" and, in some circles, post-feminism, and girdles by "Lycra
wonderpants" or some other liberated euphemism.</TE>
<TE>   Reactionary fears of the '70s--that women would desert
heterosexuality in droves or abandon marriage and family life or make
men wear aprons and yellow rubber gloves--have thus far been
unfounded. Consistently, though often inexplicably, women still fall
in love with men, get married, have babies and, according to recent
statistics, do most of the housework even if they work outside the
home as well.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, a glance through the magazine rack or self-help book section
makes it impossible to argue that this is completely a post-Stepford
world. When not racking her brain for 101 ways to really turn him on,
today's woman is exhorted to spend her free time picking an antique
armoire while blending mint and rose-hip sorbet in a kitchen tiled
with broken bits of Etruscan pottery that she excavated from Fiesole
during that last family vacation. All before picking up the kids from

<TE>   The Perfect Woman</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Levin may be guilty of stirring up something worse than a
little idle Satan-worship. The "Super-woman" myth followed "The
Stepford Wives," just as "The Exorcist" followed "Rosemary's Baby."
And why not? Reading the book as cautionary tale, what else would the
thinking woman do but try to head her homicidal mate off at the pass
by becoming practically perfect in every way? Forget the obvious
copycats, "The Rules" girls and the submissive wives. The Stepford
mentality is all around us. If Sarah Jessica Parker can go bare-armed
and stilettoed in her seventh month of pregnancy, why can't you?
Oprah Winfrey may rule the world single-handedly, but even this
season's novel du jour--"The Lovely Bones"--knows that the only real
happy ending is one with a wedding in it.</TE>
<TE>   What are shelter magazines but Stepford-wife porn? What is Martha
Stewart but a Stepford wife run amok (has anyone ever seen her
bleed)? And doesn't this explain why allegations of her relatively
minor dabbling in securities fraud has everyone frothing at the
mouth? No doubt, somewhere in the gated headquarters of a small
town's men's society, a bunch of ashen-faced computer programmers are
working some serious overtime.</TE>
<TE>   According to Levin, there is talk of remaking "The Stepford
Wives," and he hopes the deal goes through because he was not too
thrilled with the first one. He didn't have anything to do with it,
he says, and regrets that because he thought many of the scenes--with
the men in their jackets and the women in their cocktail
dresses--missed the point.</TE>
<TE>   "In Stepford," he says, "the women would have been in hot pants
and the men would have been at a softball game with the women
bringing them cold beer."</TE>
<TE>   If filmmakers really wanted to update the movie, the women would
be in hot pants, bringing the beer and holding down a $90K-plus job
telecommuting for some high-end law firm while making baby food from
the squash they grew organically in their garden.</TE>
<TE>   Gee, Joanna, sorry. I just don't have any time to go get lunch.
But I've got a pot of chai tea on the stove. Fresh made.</TE>

<HD>For This Dad, Son's 'F' Is a Family Affair</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandy Banks</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It started with the "F" in English.</LD>
<LD>   That's what got Eric Moore's attention, let him know he hadn't
been involved enough in the academic life of his 17-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   His son was a junior at Crenshaw High, long past the stage when he
needed Mom or Dad to help with schoolwork. "He'd be in his room, on
the computer, with the door open," Moore recalled. "We thought he was
doing homework. Until he brought home a failing grade."</LD>
<TE>   At first, Moore said, "I got mad at the school. Why didn't I know?
Why didn't anyone tell me? Then a bell went off. I realized that I
should have been on top of things. This was my child. That was my
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Moore headed to the school in search of answers. And what he found
had less to do with overcrowded classes, unprepared teachers and
unmotivated kids than with the waste of the single most important
resource children have--parents, who watched from the sidelines,
uninvolved.</TE>
<TE>   And he began to think that the best way to keep kids tuned in to
school might be to get their parents plugged in at home.</TE>
<TE>   Moore had never felt the need to push his son. "He was one of
those bright kids who, when he did his work, was a straight-A
student. But in 11th grade he decided he wanted to be popular more
than he wanted to be successful," Moore said. His son's attitude
changed, his schoolwork suffered--and his parents didn't notice until
it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   "From there on out, I told my son, we are going to be best
friends." For the next year, he sometimes accompanied his son to
school, sat in on classes, inspected his backpack, his homework, his
locker. He started questioning the teen's teachers, his friends, the
other parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I went a little overboard," Moore admits now. "Everyone on
campus knew me. His friends would say, 'Hey, isn't that your dad?'
I'm sure my presence made him a little embarrassed."</TE>
<TE>   But it also conveyed an important message, one that sparked a
turnaround for his son, who is now working part time and attending
junior college in Santa Monica. "Just the fact that I took an
interest, I held him to high standards, that helped him to become
more focused." And it led father and son to grow closer "because it
showed him that I cared far more about him than my job or any of my
other interests."</TE>
<TE>   The experience taught Moore something as well. He realized that
few of his son's high school classmates had the kind of parental
support he'd been pushed into providing. "A lot of parents would
complain about what's going on, but they weren't involved at the
school," he discovered. "I'd go to parent meetings and there would be
10 or 20 parents on hand" at a school that enrolls 3,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   He started canvassing parents to find out why. They blamed long
workdays, big families, their own lack of education. They couldn't
make it to meetings or volunteer on campus. They weren't home enough
to monitor their children's homework or attendance. And they didn't
realize how much it mattered.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't that they didn't care," he said. "You have a parent who
wants his kid to be a doctor or lawyer but has no idea what it takes
to get that child into college. I saw kids failing who didn't have
to."</TE>
<TE>   Moore realized that Los Angeles' overloaded schools could not be
expected to provide everything it takes to help a child succeed.
Tutoring, summer classes, homework help, specialty camps, college
counseling ... those were the new necessities, but they seemed out of
many parents' reach.</TE>
<TE>   A college-educated financial planner, Moore was savvier than most
parents he met. But even he had been frustrated by the maze of
options he encountered when he sought help for his son. "I found
there was no easy way to figure out what was out there," he said.
Reference books were often outdated, programs seemed to come and go,
the Internet offered a confusing array of education Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   So Moore took his computer expertise and compiled a CD-ROM
offering links to more than 1,200 opportunities for students,
everything from college scholarships to programs for handicapped kids
to Web sites offering homework help and tutoring. He created
EducateLA, a nonprofit group, to market the program and set about
spreading the word in the South Los Angeles community.</TE>
<TE>   And what he'd started as a research project, aimed at getting his
son into college, soon became Moore's obsession. He quit his job with
American Express and now works full-time on EducateLA. Today, four
years after it started, the group is still small, with Moore its only
paid staffer and a $200,000 annual budget drawn mostly from corporate
donations and the $11.95 sale of CD-ROMs.</TE>
<TE>   But its reach is large, and growing daily, as it draws parents
onto the information highway. "Our Web site gets 30,000 hits a
month," he said. And he's getting his CD out through hundreds of
churches, community groups and schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized a lot of parents were intimidated by the thought of
'navigating' the Internet," Moore said. "With this, you don't have to
know how to type, you don't have to know [online] commands, you don't
even need your own computer. Take it to work, to school, to the
library."</TE>
<TE>   Just point and click, and a whole new world of options comes into
view. And while they might not aim a failing kid toward Harvard, they
can give a parent a new set of tools.</TE>

<LD>Forget Paris. It was the bubble-wrap incarnations of Marie Antoinette
and Louis XVI that had guest shouting "Ooh-la-la!" at the World's
Fair benefit that raised $300,000 for AIDS Services Foundation Orange
County.</LD>
<LD>   With its salute to the City of Light, the celebration at the
Orange County Fairgrounds was a Francophile's dream. On view:
everything from tables topped with mini Eiffel Towers to a Cirque de
Paris-themed parade on the "Champs Elysees." Not to mention a chic
souvenir boutique. Or the Men Alive chorus singing "I Love Paris."</LD>
<LD>   But it wasn't until Jim Nussbaum and Tim Dey swept into the gala
as bubble-wrapped ghosts of Versailles that heads turned and eyeballs
popped. "All the materials came out of a hardware store," said Dey,
the Laguna Beach actor and designer who whipped up the costumes.
Using gift wrap, staples, tape and hot glue, he fashioned the
eerie-looking ensembles that were exquisitely detailed--from the
crowns on their heads to the slippers on their feet. "We feel royal,"
they chimed.</LD>
<TE>   Also on the party agenda: a French food court, where local vendors
dished up gourmet fare that included profiteroles stuffed with salmon
mousse and cheese fondue.</TE>
<TE>   "Fondue is making a comeback," said Soiree Catering owner Tim
Haskell as he set out trays of French bread cubes, sausage slices,
button mushrooms, asparagus spears and quartered red potatoes. The
piece de resistance: creamy milk-chocolate fondue served with
marshmallows, strawberries, dried fruits and chunks of angel food
cake and poundcake.</TE>
<TE>   Decked out in a black beret with a fresh baguette under his arm,
Jorge Rodriguez--co-chairperson of the Sept. 14 gala with Ken Jillson
and Judy Fluor-Runels--said the organization assists more than 1,500
people in Orange County who are disabled by HIV/AIDS. Services
include food, transportation, housing, emergency financial
assistance, counseling and AIDS education and prevention programs.</TE>
<TE>   "The great news is more clients are living longer," said
Rodriguez, a physician who serves on the foundation board. "The bad
news is that the overall rate of infection is increasing. People who
never thought they were susceptible to the virus are becoming
infected--heterosexual women, Hispanic women, men of color and youth
under 20 are the populations that are skyrocketing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marching On</TE>
<TE>   If not for life-saving lung therapy, Miquitzli Calli Herrera, who
was 15 weeks premature, might not have survived. But today, thanks in
part to research sponsored by the March of Dimes, she is a vibrant
3-year-old preschooler.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to convey to family and friends how important the March of
Dimes' research is," her mother, Alma Vivian Marquez, told the 260
guests attending "A Salud De Los Ninos" benefit at the Millennium
Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. "It made a difference to the health of
my baby."</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 12 benefit for the March of Dimes raised $75,000 for its
prenatal-care education programs serving Latinas and their families.</TE>
<TE>   One program, Proyecto Salud Latina, "urges all Latinas in their
childbearing years to take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily," Aliza
Lifshitz, a physician and March of Dimes spokeswoman, told the crowd.
"That's to decrease their risk of giving birth to an infant with
serious neural tube defects like spina bifida, for which our
community is at 40% to 50% higher risk than the general population."</TE>
<TE>   Another program, Comenzando bien, teaches members of the Latino
community about the importance of prenatal care, Lifshitz said. "The
curriculum is now being used at 24 sites in greater Los Angeles, and
at least 3,000 women have participated in the classes."</TE>
<TE>   During the festivities, awards were handed out to community
activists whose leadership has made a difference in the lives of
families in the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   Honored were members of the De Cardenas family (owners of Cacique
Inc.), who received the business award; Fernando Guerra, director of
the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount
University, the education award; Renan Almendarez-Coello, a radio
personality on KSCA (101.9), the entertainment award; and Kathleen A.
Torres, founding director of the Los Angeles County Office of Women's
Health, the health award.</TE>
<TE>   "All of them have balanced their professional commitments with
humanitarian efforts to ensure the well-being of our community," said
Diane G. Medina, event co-chairperson with Gustavo Valdespino and
Gisselle Acevedo-Franco. Attendees also included Ruth Livier, gala
co-emcee with Maurico Mendoza.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anniversary Bash</TE>
<TE>   When Jeff Brown, executive director of the La Mirada Theatre for
the Performing Arts, asked Corky Hale of West Hollywood to perform at
the venue, she responded, "Where's La Mirada?"</TE>
<TE>   "But this theater is a gem. It's a pleasure to play here," Hale
told the hundreds who gathered at the venue to watch its 25th
anniversary show, "A Salute to Hollywood Songwriters," starring
Melissa Manchester and Sally Kellerman.</TE>
<TE>   Produced by Hale, a pianist and world-class jazz harpist, the
production also featured performances by songwriters--including Alan
Bergman ("The Way We Were"), Hal David ("Alfie"), Lamont Dozier
("Baby, I Need Your Lovin' "), Richard M. Sherman ("It's a Small
World"), Jeff Barry ("Da Do Ron Ron") and Hale's husband Mike Stoller
("Jailhouse Rock")--singing their hits.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 14 performance, guests schmoozed with the
performers at a black-tie reception in the lobby. "I loved this,"
said Kellerman, who performed Stoller's haunting "Is That All There
Is?" "The audience was so warm."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Playhouse Benefit</TE>
<TE>   After a performance in "Blue" at the Pasadena Playhouse, Diahann
Carroll joined co-star Phylicia Rashad and other cast members for a
benefit at the home of Bill and Brenda Galloway that raised $50,000
for the theater.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely gracious of the Galloways to open their lovely
home for the playhouse," said Carroll, whose run in playwright
Charles Randolph-Wright's tale about an affluent Southern family
continues through Oct. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Also at the Sept. 8 bash were Patricia Morison, Debbie Allen,
Lainie Kazan, Connie Stevens and Jasmine Guy. Guests sipped cocktails
and sampled appetizers around the pool at the Italian-style home in
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen the play three times," Brenda Galloway said. "It's a
wonderful story about a family that puts itself ahead of its
problems."</TE>
<TE>   Added Bill Galloway, a playhouse board member: "It's a tale about
African Americans that crosses all racial lines."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Accessories to Her Expanding Empire</HD>
<DH>Kate Spade's success goes beyond handbags to cover
lifestyle accents</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Handbag designer Kate Spade rarely sees a movie more than once. But
she did go twice to "The Royal Tenenbaums," the 2001 cult hit about
an estranged family of child prodigies. Like many style makers, Spade
couldn't get enough of the exhaustively detailed set decoration of
the family townhouse--the stuffed javalina boar's head, the rotary
phones and the game closet.</LD>
<LD>   She studied the costumes, too. "I loved Bill Murray's corduroy
suit and Gwyneth Paltrow's fur coat. The whole sensibility of the
film wasn't casual, but it was easy," said the former Mademoiselle
editor, who in less than a decade parlayed a similar aesthetic into a
$70-million-a-year accessories empire.</LD>
<LD>   Her Tenenbaums fascination didn't end at the movie theater. A
zebra tote in Spade's new spring line was inspired by the red,
running-zebra pattern wallpaper in Margot Tenenbaum's (Paltrow) room.
Spade hired the film's costume designer, Karen Patch, to create a
quirky, old-money look for the Lawrences, a fictional family of five
featured in Spade's fall ad campaign.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of Margot, there's a dowdy chic Tennessee Lawrence dressed
in a 1950s red coat with black gloves and an armload of what could be
grandmother's baubles. Kate's husband, Andy, who designs men's
messenger bags and totes under the Jack Spade label, directed a short
film about the Lawrences, which will be shown at a special event in
L.A. later this year.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to see why Wes Anderson's "Tenenbaums" flick resonated
with Kate Spade. At her airy 25th Street showroom, boxy bags and
preppy, round-toed shoes sit on shelves next to classic titles such
as "The Journal of John Cheever" and "Poems of e.e. cummings." The
dusty old tomes, collected from flea markets, used-books shops and
the Internet, give a sense of history and place to Spade's fun,
feminine accessories.</TE>
<TE>   A wicker carryall from the spring collection looks as if it were
plucked from a summertime flea market; Kelly green loafers with navy
blue piping could have been borrowed from Mummy's closet; and
oversized, round sunglasses could easily be relics of the Jackie O.
1960s.</TE>
<TE>   The petite, 39-year-old, Audrey Hepburn-like designer grew up far
from the fashion world, in Kansas City, Mo. (Three clocks on the
showroom wall with the times for Kansas City, New York and Paris
serve as a reminder of her roots.) One of five children, Spade was
the daughter of a housewife, and her father ran a construction
business. Spade's first purse was a pink velvet frame bag, with a
tiny chain handle, that came with a matching pink dress. "When my
mother gave the dress to my little sister, I said, 'You don't get the
purse because I can still fit into that!' " she remembers.</TE>
<TE>   She met husband Andy (whose brother is actor David Spade) in
college at Arizona State University, when they both worked at the
same clothing store. The two moved to New York City after graduation;
Andy went into advertising and Kate into fashion. She would
eventually become the accessories editor at now defunct Mademoiselle.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to find any purses on the market that she wanted to carry,
Spade used her 401(k) money to launch a small line of square-shaped
totes in 1993. The night before introducing the line at a trade show,
she made a snap decision to put the labels on the outside of the bags
instead of the inside, which has become her signature.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Spade has won nearly every major accessory award and
opened the door for a generation of handbag designers such as Lulu
Guinness, Anya Hindmarch and L.A.'s Isabella Fiore, who are building
their own lifestyle brands around purse lines.</TE>
<TE>   Spade's business now includes stationery, shoes, pajamas,
raincoats, eyewear and most recently, bath products and perfume.
Produced through a licensing agreement with Estee Lauder, the new
beauty line (prices range from $25 to $98) includes such potions as
honeysuckle-scented cream and bath oil in packages lined with a
flower print similar to that on the wallpaper in Spade's Southampton
weekend cottage. The bath oil even comes with a terry cloth headband
emblazoned with Spade's signature label.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been crazy about beauty products," said Spade,
dressed in a black pleated Donna Karan skirt and a navy blue TSE
cashmere sweater, her hair in a perfectly untidy up 'do. "At this
time in my life, I buy into a lot of the anti-aging stuff, but what I
wanted was for my beauty products to be more of a treat than a
treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Neiman Marcus paid more than $30 million for a 56%
stake in Spade's company. She characterizes the relationship as
"invisible." The retailer has no involvement in the creative process
but has helped guide retail growth, according to Spade, who also has
seven free-standing stores. (The L.A. store on Robertson Boulevard
closed last year after a flood, but Spade is shopping for properties
in South Coast Plaza.)</TE>
<TE>   With Andy at work in a more masculine Spade showroom across the
hall, and her cotton-puff white Maltese terrier, Henry, scurrying
around at her feet, everything seems perfect in Kate's world.</TE>
<TE>   Well, almost everything. Outside, just a few blocks away from
company headquarters, street vendors are hawking Kate Spade
look-alike bags for $20, with a convincing version of her signature
labels affixed squarely on the fronts. The fakes have so saturated
the streets of New York, Los Angeles and other big cities that some
fashion types have started to shy away from the brand.</TE>
<TE>   "It's natural to be upset by it," Spade says, pouring herself a
glass of water from a chunky glass pitcher. "It's like stealing. And
I think you can always look back and say, 'We should have been more
aggressive.' But our focus has been on design. You have to make sure
you don't take your eye off what's important.... All you can really
do is move forward and hope that the customer knows the difference."
The company has a full-time staffer devoted to combating
counterfeiters, and customers often call or e-mail to report
offenders, she added.</TE>
<TE>   "I still consider Kate Spade a prestigious label, but they have to
work hard. Anything that gets too diluted loses its exclusivity,"
said Marie Claire editor in chief Lesley Jane Seymour, who just
retired a black leather Kate Spade tote she carried all summer. "I
don't think anyone looks at her differently because of the
counterfeiting."</TE>
<TE>   Neiman Marcus fashion director Joan Kaner agrees. "If someone
wants the original, they're not going to settle for the second best
or the third best. Everyone has a counterfeit problem right
now--Burberry, Tod's ... Kate Spade." Revenues of Kate Spade Inc.
have continued to rise every year, despite the counterfeiting.</TE>
<TE>   So what's next for the designer? Her spring collection (about $150
to $525) includes a boxy straw bag with leather handles and fold-over
top flaps inspired by the tourist bags sold on the streets in Mexico,
and a subtle, yellow and brown striped fabric tote modeled after a
swatch Spade picked up at one of her frequent flea market excursions.
There's also a tote emblazoned with black-and-white drawings by New
Yorker illustrator Maira Kalman, and a modern, rectangular calfskin
carryall with a hole cut out for a handle.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy kept asking me what I was going to do with the holes," Spade
says, fluffing her samples, some of which are fixed with last-minute
paper mock-ups. "He said, 'Even Dunkin' Donuts figured out what to do
with the holes.' He wanted to make key chains out of them. So we did,
and buyers have gone crazy for them!"</TE>
<TE>   She would also like to do cosmetics. But what people really seem
to want is for her to start her own family, complete with all the
requisite kiddie accessories. She hopes to soon. Forget the
Tenenbaums and the Lawrences; bring on the Spades.</TE>

<LD>Sam and Julie stood at the school bus stop. Impatiently, Sam looked
down their country road for the bus.</LD>
<LD>   "See anything?" Julie asked. She was writing her book report.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't see the bus, but I see something else."</LD>
<TE>   He tried to sound mysterious so she'd look.</TE>
<TE>   It worked. "What?" Julie looked down the road. "There's nothing
coming yet. I think we're early."</TE>
<TE>   "Look on the road," Sam said. "There are three of them."</TE>
<TE>   "Tarantulas!" she yelled. "Three of the biggest ones I've ever
seen. And they're gorgeous. But what are they doing in the middle of
the road?"</TE>
<TE>   "Going home," Sam answered. "Don't you remember that Grandpa
explained they always go home at the end of September, right after we
go back to school?"</TE>
<TE>   "Is it because we go back to school?" Julie teased.</TE>
<TE>   "No, silly. It's time for them to go home. Grandpa said it was in
their genes."</TE>
<TE>   "If they always go home at this time of year, why do they leave in
the first place? Why don't they just stay home?"</TE>
<TE>   Sam looked at her with surprise. "I'm going to have to ask Grandpa
about that."</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't you ask a tarantula?" Julie said. "Here they come."</TE>
<TE>   "Do I look like a tarantula to you?" Sam asked, kneeling down so
he could get a closer look at the beautiful creatures as they headed
their way.</TE>
<TE>   Julie knelt down too, and watched the first one walk past her. "We
need to do something so their relatives won't get killed by a car or
truck."</TE>
<TE>   Then she remembered her yellow pad of paper on which she'd been
writing her book report. She ripped a page off the pad and used a
marker to write on it.</TE>
<TE>   "There," she said, when she finished. Then she fastened the paper
to the trunk of a scrub oak growing alongside the school bus stop.</TE>
<TE>   Sam read it. "Tarantula Crossing." He laughed. "Leave it to my
sister to do something nice for tarantulas."</TE>

<HD>Guide Lends Clarity to Buying and Selling</HD>
<DH>"Kiplinger's Buying &amp; Selling a Home," by Kiplinger Editors
(Kiplinger Books, Washington, D.C., 2002), $17.95, 354 pages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you are a serious home buyer or seller who doesn't want to get
ripped off, first read the latest edition of "Kiplinger's Buying and
Selling a Home." This book anticipates home-selling problems that
could arise for buyers and sellers.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the book is about buying a home; one-third is about
selling. However, whether you are buying or selling, read the entire
book because the information you need might be in either section.</LD>
<LD>   Especially valuable are the sidebars, with details on where to
obtain more information about topics covered. For example, the home
inspection chapter refers to an excellent book on home inspections as
well as information on the major home warranty companies and their
addresses.</LD>
<TE>   This well-designed book is easy to understand. In addition to
boldface headings for each new subject, the margins contain concise
summaries of what is explained on that page.</TE>
<TE>   The many Web site listings where readers can get more information
on various topics are especially valuable. Many of the sidebars
contain phone numbers too.</TE>
<TE>   The cover says the book is written by the editors of Kiplinger's
Personal Finance Magazine. However, including the names of the each
chapter's author as well as their qualifications would have added
credibility and authenticity. The anonymous authorship leaves readers
wondering how well the writers know their topics.</TE>
<TE>   The book's weakest part is the third devoted to selling. A big
portion of this section discusses alternatives to selling, such as
obtaining a home equity loan. The tax angles of principal residence
home sales are heavily emphasized, especially the tax exemption of
$250,000 per qualified seller.</TE>
<TE>   However, little attention is devoted to receiving top dollar for
your home. Selecting a sharp realty agent who will market your home
effectively receives inadequate coverage. And the book barely
scratches the surface of how to sell your home without a professional
agent.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because there is no author who takes responsibility, the
book seems bland and without a focus. It emphasizes facts but
provides little enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   The book is also long on details but short on interpreting them.
It doesn't offer much specific help for overcoming typical
home-purchase or sales problems.</TE>
<TE>   The writers researched their material extremely well but failed to
interpret enough to make the sometimes boring facts useful to
readers.</TE>
<TE>   The content cannot be faulted. Topics are well covered, but what
is lacking is the practical application to real-life buyer and seller
situations. Readers may find it difficult to relate to the home sales
facts presented because the book is so impersonal, but the checklists
and valuable information make worthwhile reading.</TE>

<HD>Board's Whispering Campaigns Carry Liabilities for All</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN GLASSMAN and DONIE VANITZIAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: The common interest development where I live has 51 homes
and an unresponsive and controlling board. When we purchased our
house more than 35 years ago, the homeowner association was inactive,
and everyone went about their business with no hassle, strife or
complaints.</LD>
<LD>   A group of homeowners has dominated board positions for more than
17 years. They do this successfully by implementing whispering
campaigns of lies against homeowners they don't like. They instill a
fear of lawsuits and hold meetings behind the backs of homeowners
without producing minutes.</LD>
<LD>   The board has made it clear that it will not accept comments or
complaints from homeowners unless they are "constructive." No
definition for constructive has been given.</LD>
<TE>   Some homeowners are totally frustrated. Those who are not part of
the clique stand no chance of getting on the board.</TE>
<TE>   I hired an arbitrator to resolve this but the board refuses to
return his calls. Because I hired an arbitrator, the board now says
that all meetings are in executive session.</TE>
<TE>   How can I stop these whispering campaigns? Can the board limit the
types of complaints homeowners can make or how they will respond to
them? If so, what can minority homeowners do?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Boards use whispering campaigns to further their own
interests. Because targeted homeowners have no recourse against
boards like yours, it is difficult to fight them.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, it is difficult to pinpoint those who set the
whispers in motion, which makes these campaigns successful for boards
and disastrous for homeowners. The tactic is used to compel the
complaining homeowner to either give up their complaints or sell and
move away.</TE>
<TE>   Either way the board gets rid of the complainant.</TE>
<TE>   Whispering campaigns should be taken seriously and can be
dangerous if initiated by board members because, depending on the
content of those whispers, the person or persons starting or
repeating them could be liable for slander, thus exposing all
homeowners to liability.</TE>
<TE>   The continual reelection of the same clique of board members
rotating among themselves year after year can be a sign that they are
trying to keep certain information from the other homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   Under California's Davis-Stirling Act, homeowners may attend any
meeting of their association's board except for executive sessions
and, while the board may adjourn to an executive session to discuss
your hiring of an arbitrator and its response, it may not call such
sessions to conduct the everyday business of the association.</TE>
<TE>   Civil Code section 1363.05 lists the reasons a board may adjourn
to executive session. One requirement is that the board note in the
minutes the general description of any matter discussed in executive
session.</TE>
<TE>   Merely because you hired an arbitrator does not give the board the
right to conduct all its business in executive session. But because
the law does not provide a penalty, there is nothing short of a
lawsuit that can make your board change.</TE>
<TE>   There is also nothing in the Davis-Stirling Act that requires
homeowner complaints be "constructive." Your board's refusal to
accept anything other than constructive comments raises the question
of whether it is fulfilling its fiduciary duty to the other
homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   Adding the contingency of constructive to homeowners trying to
contact the individuals who sign the checks, deposit money, maintain
and repair the property, adds another layer of control between you
and your asset.</TE>
<TE>   Avoiding lawsuits takes common sense. Maintaining the property and
acting in good faith while making decisions should be adequate
protection from liability for most boards. Liability insurance
required by the Davis-Stirling Act for associations covers the costs
of providing attorneys to defend the association and its board
members in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   By not answering your arbitrator's calls, the board breached its
duty to act in good faith. Boards know the only avenue open for you
to pursue your rights is to hire an attorney and sue them. Once sued,
the insurance pays for the board's defense.</TE>
<TE>   Raising the fear of lawsuits to get re-elected may indicate more
serious problems behind the scenes at your association. Couple that
with the whispering campaigns and the "constructive" contingency
imposed on the homeowners, and your board's actions may pose serious
legal problems for all the homeowners.</TE>

<HD>Tudor Cottage Has a Colorful Past</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>RUTH RYON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This 1928 Tudor-style cottage was used by actress Joan Blondell as a
personal dressing room, according to local lore. It is even more
fanciful since Los Angeles architectural designer Mark Dodge and his
partner, Howard Baker, turned it into their L.A. home five years ago.
Baker won three Emmy Awards as director of "Rugrats."</LD>
<LD>   The home, in a hillside neighborhood of Silver Lake, is on a
cul-de-sac with several other cottages constructed by early Hollywood
set builders and artisans. The house stands out partly because of
Dodge's whimsical use of color but also because of his addition of a
garden with three exterior "rooms." The Country English city garden
has a brick courtyard, a gravel garden includes a reflecting pond and
a grassy lawn is bordered by a low masonry wall.</LD>
<LD>   About this home: Dodge also turned the upstairs of the house,
formerly the attic, into a salon with views of the garden and

<LD>Courteney Cox and David Arquette have listed their Westside home at
just under $6.5 million. The husband-and-wife actors also have a
beach retreat.</LD>
<LD>   Cox Arquette has a passion for redoing houses and, now that she
has completed work on their Westside home, she is ready to take on
another one.</LD>
<LD>   She started renovating and redecorating this house after buying it
in 1996, the year that the first "Scream" movie was released. Both
appeared in the film.</LD>
<TE>   Built in 1949, the house has five bedrooms and 5.5 baths in about
5,200 square feet. The Bermuda plantation-style home, designed by
John Byers, sits on about three-fourths of an acre, behind gates,
with rolling lawns and a pool.</TE>
<TE>   The house has a great room with soaring ceilings and large
skylights, a master suite with a fireplace and a sitting area, and a
detached guest suite and gym. There is also an outdoor living room
called "an entertainer's loggia."</TE>
<TE>   Cox Arquette, 38, co-starred in "Scream 2" (1997), "Scream 3"
(2000) and "3000 Miles to Graceland" (2001). She is just starting her
eighth season on the TV series "Friends."</TE>
<TE>   David Arquette, 31, also appeared in the "Scream" films and
co-stars in the upcoming movie "The Grey Zone," with Harvey Keitel
and Mira Sorvino. He had a leading role in "Eight-Legged Freaks,"
released in July.</TE>
<TE>   He is in "Stealing Sinatra," an upcoming Showtime movie based on
the 1963 kidnapping of Frank Sinatra Jr., and he co-stars with Whoopi
Goldberg in the Holiday NBC-TV movie "A Very Muppet Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Jonah Wilson at Prudential California, John Aaroe Division in
Beverly Hills, has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Bernie McCullough, star of "The Bernie Mac Show" comedy series on
Fox and a nominee at tonight's Emmy Awards, has leased a Hollywood
Hills home for a year at $8,500 a month.</TE>
<TE>   The comedian-actor, who was in the movie "Ocean's Eleven" (2001)
and co-starred in the Martin Lawrence-Danny DeVito film "What's the
Worst That Could Happen?" (2001), leased a gated villa with three
bedrooms, three bathrooms, a motorcourt and a pool.</TE>
<TE>   Built in the late '50s, the home also has city and valley views.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough was featured in Spike Lee's documentary film "The
Original Kings of Comedy" (2000), based on a comedy act featuring
McCullough along with comedians Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer
and D.L. Hughley.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Bernie Mac Show," McCullough, 45, plays a comedian who
suddenly becomes the guardian of his sister's three children. He's
due to play Bosley in "Charlie's Angels 2" (2003).</TE>
<TE>   Brent Watson at DBL, Beverly Hills, had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Peterman, who plays a dental hygienist on WB's "Reba"
(starring country-music star Reba McEntire), and her husband,
actor-writer John Brady, have become first-time home buyers with
their purchase of a gated Spanish home in Silver Lake for $569,000.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,400-square-foot house, built in 1936, has two bedrooms, 1.75
bathrooms, a living room with coved ceilings and hardwood floors, an
outdoor fireplace, a pool and a spa. The house also has hand-painted
tiles.</TE>
<TE>   Peterman, now 31, made her film debut in the movie "Fargo" (1996).
She and Brady are from St. Paul, Minn., where they have been active
in theater. She will host a "Best of 15 Minutes of Fem" night Sept.
30 at the Chautauqua Theatre Alliance, 1625 N. Las Palmas, just south
of Hollywood Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Caldwell of Housing Solutions, Los Feliz, represented the
buyers; Reza Faraham and Tyler Giles of DBL Realtors had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Fess Parker, who played Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett on TV
during the '50s and '60s and now owns a winery in the Santa Ynez
Valley, and his wife, Marcy, had hardly listed their Montecito home
earlier this month at $3.2 million when they got an all-cash,
full-price offer.</TE>
<TE>   The three-bedroom, Mediterranean-style home, in the gated
community of Birnam Wood Golf Club, already has closed escrow.</TE>
<TE>   The Parkers sold the house, which they had owned since 1998,
because it was too much of a commute on a regular basis to their
winery in Foxen Canyon and their country inn in Los Olivos.</TE>
<TE>   They now plan to build a hacienda in their vineyard, said their
real estate agent, Paul O'Keeffe of Joyce Gibb Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   O'Keeffe had the listing with Daniel Encell of Prudential
California Realty. Both are in Montecito.</TE>
<TE>   Emilie McMinn of Village Properties, Montecito, represented the
buyers, Montecito residents originally from the Santa Ynez Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Roger Birnbaum and his wife, Pamela, have purchased a
Malibu home for just under $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Nantucket-style home, built in 1999, has four bedrooms and six
bathrooms in about 4,000 square feet. The kitchen opens to a porch on
the beach. The library is also a projection room. The home has city
and ocean views.</TE>
<TE>   The producer was once the executive vice president of 20th Century
Fox, where he oversaw production in the early '90s of such movies as
"Home Alone," "Die Hard 2," "My Cousin Vinny" and "White Men Can't
Jump."</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, he joined Joe Roth's new Caravan Pictures, which had a
five-year, 25-picture deal with Disney. When Roth became chairman of
Disney in 1993, Birnbaum became head of Caravan.</TE>
<TE>   Now Birnbaum is co-chairman with Gary Barber of Spyglass
Entertainment, and they are executive producers of a number of
upcoming TV projects, including the series "Miracles," due to
premiere in January on ABC. Birnbaum and Barber founded Spyglass in
1998. Since then, they have produced such hit films as "The Sixth
Sense."</TE>
<TE>   Adrienne Maloof-Nassif, an owner of the Sacramento Kings and the
Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, has listed her Wilshire condo at
just under $1.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Maloof-Nassif is selling her home of about five years because she
recently married Dr. Paul Nassif, a Beverly Hills surgeon who owns
the Holly Street Bar &amp; Grill, an upscale Pasadena restaurant created
a number of years ago in a former mortuary.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, in their 30s, has purchased an 11,000-square-foot
mansion with a tennis court off Mulholland Drive.</TE>
<TE>   The condo is in The Wilshire, a 28-story, 96-unit tower built in
1991. Maloof-Nassif's unit, which she redecorated, has two bedrooms
and 2.5 bathrooms in about 2,600 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The unit also has a steam shower, sunken tub and ocean-to-mountain
views. The Wilshire has a gym, pool, sauna, security staff, concierge
and valet parking.</TE>
<TE>   Maloof-Nassif is the daughter of the late George and Colleen
Maloof, former owners of the Houston Rockets. The family is known as
owners of the Kings, the 17,300-seat Arco Arena in Sacramento and the
Palms Casino Resort.</TE>
<TE>   Nassif is a surgeon in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery.</TE>
<TE>   His brother, Christopher Nassif,  has the listing at Queen Anne
Realty, Beverly Hills.</TE>

<HD>His Evolving Space</HD>
<DH>Actor Leonard Nimoy's home is a canvas for his passion for
art</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH RYON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leonard Nimoy's Los Angeles home looks more like an art gallery than
a starship.</LD>
<LD>   "Star Trek" reminders, such as the last pair of pointy rubber ears
the actor wore as the half-human, half-Vulcan Mr. Spock, are
displayed in his study, but he's quick to say, "There isn't much of
that."</LD>
<LD>   A Renaissance man, Nimoy has assumed many roles besides the
imperturbable alien on the famous sci-fi TV series and spinoff
movies. He starred in the one-man stage show "Vincent," about Vincent
Van Gogh; directed a number of movies, including two "Star Trek"
films and "Three Men and a Baby"; and wrote his autobiography, his
memoirs and five books of poetry.</LD>
<TE>   Now the consummate hyphenate (actor-director-writer-producer) is
focusing on his love of art and his first book of photographs.</TE>
<TE>   He will appear at a dinner hosted by Beverly Hills gallery owner
Mark Selwyn as part of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art benefit
"Art of the Palate 2002," starting Thursday. More than 50 dining
occasions with Nimoy and other celebrities are planned. The theme of
Nimoy's Oct. 1 dinner is "The Renaissance Men."</TE>
<TE>   Nimoy is also about to launch his book tour to promote "Shekhina,"
published by Umbrage Editions in New York. The fine-art book grew out
of his childhood experience in a synagogue when he sneaked a peek at
elders giving a sign for a blessing during which the Shekhina, the
female emanation of God, was said to be entering the temple. He later
interpreted the sign for "Star Trek" as the Vulcan greeting.</TE>
<TE>   The book, a photographic study of the female form, is about the
feminine presence of God, Nimoy said. "The idea has stirred up a lot
of interest .... It's an area I never explored before."</TE>
<TE>   As Nimoy, 71, has shifted his concentration, he has made changes
to his primary residence. Over the dozen or so years that he has
lived there, the house, built in the mid-'40s, has been refurbished
several times.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, he said, "we just freshened things up" with the
help of L.A.-based interior designer Rosemary Peck.</TE>
<TE>   Nimoy lives in the home with his wife, Susan, a trustee of the
Museum of Contemporary Art.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after moving in, the couple started collecting art. "It gives
us energy," he said. "It's life affirming."</TE>
<TE>   He also views his house as a work of art, saying, "There is
wonderful, positive energy in it."</TE>
<TE>   The Mediterranean-style home--with its arches, white walls and
Spanish pavers--has a master bedroom suite that they expanded, a
study for him, an office for her, a bedroom for her college-age son
and a guest quarters with a garden view. The house has a family room,
which was set up last week for Yom Kippur; a dining room with a new
chandelier and off-white chair coverings; and a kitchen with an
extra-large refrigerator and a banquette.</TE>
<TE>   A toy train circles the family room near the ceiling. "Susan had
it put in for my birthday a few years ago, because I complained that
I never had one," Nimoy said. The train, like the outdoor pool,
especially appeals to his grandchildren. He has five, ages 10 to 17.
He has two children by a former marriage; his wife has one.</TE>
<TE>   He keeps little memorabilia: marker boards for some movies he
directed, a photo of himself with "Star Trek" star William Shatner, a
director's chair with his name on it.</TE>
<TE>   A large movie poster in the family room advertises his first
sci-fi movie: "Zombies of the Stratosphere." It was released by
Republic Studios in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a great moment," he said, showing a small, framed photo
of himself with actress Ingrid Bergman in the 1982 TV miniseries "A
Woman Called Golda."</TE>
<TE>   He keeps a copy of a TV Guide cover from last year featuring TV's
greatest characters. Spock was one of four.</TE>
<TE>   Nimoy prefers to talk about contemporary art and has what he
describes as "one important piece" relating to "Star Trek." Called
"The Enterprise," for the starship, it's a sculpture by Joseph Beuys,
a German artist and "Star Trek" fan. It depicts Beuys and his family
watching "Star Trek" on TV.</TE>
<TE>   The Nimoys have fun and fanciful art as well as serious pieces
such as a work by Anselm Kiefer about chaos and the Holocaust. There
are also two Al Hirschfeld cartoons of "Star Trek" characters and
several pairs of beaded shoes and slippers made by artist Liza Lou.
"She built them for us from scratch," the actor said. Lou's shoes
decorate a hall, where they sit like real footwear, slipped off in a
hurry.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the changes on the Nimoys' acre-sized property have been
decorative in recent years. One of the largest projects was the
addition of a private patio off the actor's study. He likes the light
there and the purple bougainvillea.</TE>
<TE>   About seven years ago, the Nimoys added a 1,200-square-foot room
over the garage to the 3,100-plus-square-foot house. They use the
room for exercising twice a week with a personal trainer and
activities such as working on his photographs.</TE>
<TE>   The room has a darkroom and a seamless backdrop for photography.</TE>
<TE>   Like the pointy ears, a photo of an older gentleman is produced by
the actor, not from a storage box or a filing cabinet but from a
desktop, as a daily reminder that the past is part of the present.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a picture I took of my grandfather when I was 12," he
said, holding it in one hand while reaching for some old photo
equipment with his other, "and this is our family camera from the
'30s and '40s that I used to build the enlarger, which made this
print."</TE>
<TE>   The room addition overlooks the backyard, which underwent a major
transition about 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   When the Nimoys bought the house, the yard was clearly sliced
through its middle by a 30-foot-deep ravine.</TE>
<TE>   "We built the equivalent of a freeway overpass there," he said.
"We put 19 pylons into the bedrock, added a concrete platform and
then put in about 3 to 4 feet of top soil and, finally, sod."</TE>
<TE>   The ravine is still there, but it is hidden by the platform, which
makes the yard larger and more usable. The yard has a pool and a
barbecue area with outdoor heaters.</TE>
<TE>   A hammock between two sycamores belies the work that made possible
its restful look.</TE>
<TE>   The Nimoys have two other homes. One is on the waterfront at Lake
Tahoe, where he has another darkroom and a 1968 wood boat, a Century
Coronado. The other home is a two-bedroom, two-bathroom,
1,800-square-foot apartment on New York's Upper West Side.</TE>
<TE>   The couple use their homes and never tire of the art they have
collected, he said. The Nimoys move the art from time to time from
place to place, even from one end of the country to the other.</TE>
<TE>   "When we buy a new piece of art, we start moving other pieces
around, so we are constantly refreshed by the movement," he said.</TE>
<TE>   They know they are fortunate. "When I was fresh out of the Army in
the '50s, I used to drive a taxi in this neighborhood," he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Boston native has had what he calls "a lot of
fun."</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a great ride, doing things I want to do," he said.</TE>

<HD>Rental Buildings Not Overvalued</HD>
<DH>UCLA forecaster doesn't see a 'price bubble' in the
Southland's rapidly appreciating multifamily housing market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the dramatic increase in the price of Southern California
apartments last year, those buildings are not overvalued, nor is the
rapid appreciation indicative of a "price bubble," according to a
UCLA multifamily-housing forecast released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The per-unit prices for apartments in Los Angeles, Orange and San
Diego counties rose by more than 15% in 2001, provoking worry among
some real estate analysts that a "bubble" was on the horizon. But
Stephen Cauley, associate director of Ziman Center for Real Estate at
UCLA's Anderson School and author of the forecast, dispelled that
fear.</LD>
<LD>   "Are prices too high? Maybe in some areas," Cauley said. "But in
the short run, we are not in for trouble."</LD>
<TE>   Cauley's upbeat assessment of the multifamily housing market is
based on the expectation that mortgage interest will remain stable
and inflation in check. Additionally, occupancy rates are expected to
remain the same next year, and rents should grow at a slow rate.</TE>
<TE>   The region is expected to see an increased demand for multifamily
housing as the number of young, educated professionals and
lower-income families unable to afford homeownership grows. That will
likely fuel an increase in rent prices again next year.</TE>
<TE>   While the demand for apartment housing is expected to be addressed
for wealthier young professionals, lower-to moderate-income renters
still will face a shortfall in the coming year and longer as new
construction of apartment units is expected to go up in higher-priced
neighborhoods but remain far behind in the areas of the region that
most need it.</TE>
<TE>   Northern and northwestern San Diego County, in particular, will
see growth in apartment rents, Cauley said, as high-tech and
defense-industry employment there continues to grow, fueling a demand
for the limited number of apartment units available.</TE>
<TE>   A number of factors could limit the growth of apartment
construction. Spiraling rents could affect immigration into Southern
California and emigration out of the region, and further erosion in
the stock market could hurt growth. A major oil price or terrorism
shock also could affect the investment market, Cauley said.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest threat to the apartment market and the housing market
overall, however, is the potential for a price bubble. That happens
when housing price increases spur expectations of price increases,
which in turn push property values up higher than most buyers can
afford. At that point, buyers dump out of the market and prices
plunge.</TE>
<TE>   Most economists do not see that happening in the near future,
however, while interest rates remain low and the demand for housing
outstrips the supply.</TE>

<HD>Del Webb and California Pacific Top Buyer Survey</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>California Pacific Homes and Del Webb Communities tied for first
place in customer satisfaction for the Southern California/San Diego
home-building market, according to a J.D. Power &amp; Associates survey
of individuals who bought homes from 38 area builders.</LD>
<LD>   The study, in its sixth year, was conducted in 16 U.S.
home-building markets. Homeowners provided feedback after living in
their homes on average from four to 18 months.</LD>
<LD>   "With the housing market continuing to sizzle across the United
States and interest rates at the lowest we've seen in decades,
competition in the home-building industry is intensifying," said
Paula Sonkin, a senior director at Westlake Village-based J.D. Power.</LD>
<TE>   The study's index scores nine factors of customer satisfaction,
including customer service, home readiness (the timely completion of
the home), sales staff and the quality of workmanship and materials.</TE>
<TE>   Following California Pacific and Del Webb in the rankings were
Greystone Homes, Shapell, Lennar, Pacific Bay, Van Daele, Shea,
Continental, Pardee, McMillin, William Lyon, Centex, John Laing, MBK,
Warmington, Beazer and KB Home, which all finished above average in
the study.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California builders must have sold 150 or more homes in
Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and Ventura
counties in 2001 to be included in the study.</TE>

<LD>Gary Friedman's photo essay ("The Long Year of Rescue 5," Sept. 1)
was moving and timely, and it brought home the horror of Sept. 11,
2001. As someone who was born and raised on Staten Island, I felt
this was a tribute to those who perished from my hometown. I watched
the towers fall from 3,000 miles away and was hysterical, not knowing
where my family and friends were. I may or may not have known those
men, but I know the sorrow. They were my brothers, and it easily
could have been my blood.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Friedman's moving pictures brought to life the enduring tragedy of
Sept. 11. On Sept. 10, 1985, my wife and I shared in the joy of the
birth of the third of our five biological children. On Sept. 4, 1995,
we lost him swiftly to a brain tumor. The month of September and the
number 5 are painfully significant to our family--and so, it now
seems, to our country. Still, as Friedman writes, we are "starting to
smile again," and that is great hope for the bereaved families and
this nation.</TE>

<HD>Another Look at the Cathedral</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I had the privilege of touring the Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels a few months ago ("Mother Church of a Secular City?" by Larry
B. Stammer, Aug. 25). I was impressed with the sheer scale of the
job, the elaborate precautions taken against earthquake damage, the
richness of the materials and the meticulous detail of the
architecture. As a piece of design and construction, it is an
undeniable achievement. As a Roman Catholic cathedral, however, it is
a disaster.</LD>
<LD>   In appearance and atmosphere, this is a profoundly anti-Christian
place. The massive entrance is a blind alley out of a pharaoh's tomb.
The nave, with its downward-sloping floor and low ceiling, feels dark
and oppressive--unlike the transcendent open space flooded with light
that one expects in a Catholic church. The altar is a massive slab of
blood-red marble imported from Turkey--a savagely pagan touch, like
the sacrificial table atop an Aztec temple. Unfortunately, the
archdiocese is going to suffer the consequences of this grotesque
white elephant for decades to come.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin McMahon</LD>
<TE>   Tarzana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have donated my last penny to the Catholic Church. The "Taj
Mahony" should more likely be named Our Lady of Hypocrisy! What can
one think of a church and its officials who have no substantial
programs in place to aid the poor and the homeless, and at the same
time build monuments to their egos? Has everyone gone mad?</TE>
<TE>   The ongoing scandals of the clergy and the cover-ups by Cardinal
Roger Mahony and his peers point out the absence of their piety. They
have been caught in lies and have spent millions of donated dollars
in payoffs to cover up their folly. It's time for the Catholics of
the world to take back the church from these embezzlers of faith!</TE>

<HD>The Cultural Anarchist vs. the Hollywood Police State</HD>
<DH>A Stanford Professor Is One Supreme Court Decision Away
From Ending Copyrights on Thousands of Movies, Books and Songs. If He
Wins, the Entertainment Industry Will Have to Find Other Ways to Make
Money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>David Streitfeld is a Times staff writer based in the
Bay Area.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larry Lessig is a 41-year-old Stanford University law professor who
still looks like a graduate student, someone who has spent years in
library stacks researching arcane subjects, miles from the real
world. He's very pale and very quiet, as if he doesn't want to bother
the fellow in the next cubicle. His hair sometimes sticks straight
up, but he doesn't notice. Lessig has a student's idealism, too; he
wants to change the way the world does business.</LD>
<LD>   The entertainment industry, Lessig feels, is locking up old
movies, books and songs that long ago should have transcended private
ownership and become the property of the people, just as Thomas
Jefferson, James Madison and the other framers of the Constitution
intended. At stake, he says, is not only our common cultural
heritage, but also the freedom that writers and musicians and
filmmakers must have to interpret, reinterpret, adapt, borrow,
sample, mock, imitate, parody, criticize--the very lifeblood of the
creative process.</LD>
<LD>   But Lessig doesn't merely want to free the past. He wants to free
the future as well. That's something else that the entertainment
companies want to lock up. The laws they are proposing and the
technologies they are developing, he says, will make creativity on
the Internet a wholly owned subsidiary of the Recording Industry
Assn. of America and the Motion Picture Assn. of America.</LD>
<TE>   His immediate target is a 1998 law that extended copyright
protection an additional 20 years. It was a measure so obscure that
the Senate passed it unanimously, with no debate and little public
discussion. But it so outraged Lessig that he mounted what has become
the first constitutional challenge of copyright limits to ever reach
the Supreme Court. On Oct. 9, the former Supreme Court law clerk will
try to persuade the justices to end private ownership of hundreds of
thousands of artistic works, including some of America's most
cherished. If he gets the court to agree, both the past and the
future will change.</TE>
<TE>   ''The world won't end,'' he says. ''Hollywood will just have to
find a different way to make money.''</TE>
<TE>   During the past three years, as his copyright lawsuit has wended
its way through the courts, Lessig has been talking it up in forums
around the country and Europe. Walt Disney, he is always careful to
say, is his hero.</TE>
<TE>   Disney, one of the most popular artists of the 20th century, knew
what a bountiful resource the past could be. He refashioned the
Brothers Grimm's dark fairy tale "Snow White" into an upbeat charmer.
He took Perrault's "Cinderella" and made it an enduring fable of
pluckiness. "Alice in Wonderland," "The Jungle Book," "Pinocchio,"
"The Three Little Pigs," "Treasure Island" were all adapted from
classics and became classics themselves.</TE>
<TE>   What outrages Lessig is that Disney and other entertainment
companies don't want this process repeated with their own works. They
want very much to continue earning money by keeping their copyrights
forever. Toward that end, Congress has extended copyright 11 times in
the past 40 years, effectively locking away everything that Disney
and every other entertainment company have ever produced.</TE>
<TE>   If copyright laws lock up the past, they also are a very potent
instrument for controlling the Internet. To a group of computer
programmers in Monterey, Lessig recounts an anecdote about Sony's
robot dog, Aibo. An Aibo fan wrote a software program to make the dog
dance to jazz. When the fan posted the code on the Internet so that
other Aibo enthusiasts could teach their own dogs to dance, Sony
lawyers contacted him and told him he had violated the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. Even though you've spent $1,500 for an
Aibo, Sony still has control over how you play with it.</TE>
<TE>   ''Ours is less and less a free society,'' Lessig says. ''The law
is trying to make creativity a regulated industry.''</TE>
<TE>   Lessig was a professional singer as a child, which gives him a
natural ease on stage. His audiences often applaud mightily. But no
one writes to Congress protesting how copyright is being abused on
the Net. No one holds demonstrations. ''We have this culture of
passivity,'' he says. ''Most people like being spoon-fed culture.
Look at the reaction to shutting Napster down. There was none. It's
like we're the Soviet Union after communism. We've had 80 years of
massive broadcast culture. It's the only way we know to experience
the world.''</TE>
<TE>   His lawsuit, officially titled Eldred v. Ashcroft, is a way of
forcing the issue. It's a measure of the strength and importance of
Lessig's case that he will be opposed in court by Theodore B. Olson,
the U.S. Solicitor General himself, and not some government
underling. Olson won all eight cases he argued before the Supreme
Court last term.</TE>
<TE>   The court will consider the passage in the Constitution that
states ''to promote the progress of science and useful arts,''
Congress should grant copyright only for ''limited times.'' For
Congress in 1790, the limit was 14 years, plus another 14 if the
creator was still alive. By that standard, "Snow White," made in
1937, would have joined Shakespeare, Jane Austen and Mark Twain in
the public domain in 1965. Instead, "Snow White" is now due to enter
the public domain in 2032--unless, of course, copyright is extended
again.</TE>
<TE>   Lessig will argue that the extensions give the entertainment
companies "a perpetual term on the installment plan.'' For the
benefit of big campaign contributors, he contends, Congress is
perverting what the framers intended. Olson will respond that since
copyright is not literally perpetual, Congress' extensions are
constitutional.</TE>
<TE>   There's another wrinkle, one that speaks to Lessig's anger over
the broadening of all forms of copyright. Congress, by giving an
additional 20 years to copyright holders, is also abridging freedom
of speech, he argues. If the justices buy that point, new legislation
would have to take Lessig's case into account. It could act as a
brake on the entertainment industry's constant search for new legal
tactics to put the Internet in lockdown mode while it frisks everyone
for unauthorized content.</TE>
<TE>   ''The Supreme Court isn't owned by Hollywood,'' Lessig says. ''I'm
quite confident they'll see that a free culture is a free speech
issue. The law will be struck down.''</TE>
<TE>   It's already getting hard to remember what it was like before the
internet brought a million different voices into your home. If you
grew up in the 1970s and lived in a small town, the way Lessig did,
culture and news were one-way streets. If you wanted to react to
something, you could write a letter to the newspaper that they
probably wouldn't print, or send a screed to a fanzine that no one
except a few like-minded souls would see. The local department store
sold a few books and some popular records, but anything the slightest
bit out of the mainstream had to be special-ordered--if you even knew
about it and if it even existed.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet blew through all those barricades and limitations. In
its mid-1990s heyday, the Net was all about experimentation and
openness, a place where no one needed a printing press to publish an
article or a record company to distribute music or Wall Street's
approval to start a company, where the only constraint on innovation
was the imagination.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing ordained that it had to stay that way. Very quickly,
in fact, various interests got busy lobbying for laws and developing
technology that would turn the Net into a closed system. It will
bring entertainment directly to your eyeballs and eardrums for a
moment, for a price. ''Once you start down this road, there's only
one logic, and that's the logic of total control,'' says Duke
University law professor James Boyle. ''It's a world of pervasive
monitoring, because the creator has to get his money at every
stage.''</TE>
<TE>   One reason there's been little uproar about this is that the
entertainment industry is very good at seizing the high ground. It
long ago took control of all the good words in this fight: Pirate.
Thief. Hacker. Stealing. It racheted up the invective, too. An Assn.
of American Publishers official last year called librarians who
believed in free content--a central principle of libraries for a few
centuries--''Ruby Ridge or Waco types.'' Jack Valenti, chief
executive of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, calls the struggle
against unauthorized copying a ''terrorist war.'' In a February op-ed
piece in the Washington Post, he asserted that ''the movie industry
is under siege from a small community of professors.''</TE>
<TE>   An industry with about $70 billion in worldwide revenues being
thwarted by a handful of scholars, none of whom could get within a
mile of Morton's on Oscar night? ''When I read that,'' says Boyle,
''I had a Monty Pythonesque image of a siege of this massive castle
by a tiny number of individuals armed only with insults. 'Now open
your gates,' they were yelling, 'or we shall taunt you once again.'
''</TE>
<TE>   Yet Valenti might be right when it comes to Lessig. ''He thinks we
ought to rise up against Disney like the Serbians attacking
Milosevic,'' says novelist and cyber-rights activist Bruce Sterling.</TE>
<TE>   Lessig doesn't boycott mass culture. His wife, Bettina, volunteers
that he's always eager to see the latest blockbuster--"Minority
Report," "The Sum of All Fears." He just wants to get rid of the
lawyers. Disney's most enduring creation, he points out in his
lectures, was directly derived from another work: Mickey Mouse was a
parody of Buster Keaton's "Steamboat Bill." Nowadays, doing a parody
like Mickey on or off-line would be an open invitation to a lawsuit.
That's what Alice Randall got when she tried last year to publish
"The Wind Done Gone," a parody of "Gone With the Wind" done from the
slaves' point of view. The heirs of Margaret Mitchell slapped Randall
with a lawsuit, claiming she was infringing on the copyright of the
1936 original. Publication of the novel was held up until an appeals
court said it could be released on free speech grounds.</TE>
<TE>   When Mitchell wrote her novel, she expected it would enter the
public domain in 1992. With the extensions, this key piece of
American culture is off-limits until 2031. ''Creativity always builds
off the past,'' Lessig says, ''and if you call that theft, you don't
understand what creativity is.''</TE>
<TE>   Valenti says that ''what Larry and some of his cohorts believe is
in the digital world everything ought to be available to everyone. No
constraints on the rights of creative property at all.''</TE>
<TE>   While this isn't what Lessig thinks, the strange thing is that
it's pretty close to what the framers of the Constitution believed.
Indeed, what's odd about the current copyright fight is how much it's
a contemporary remake of an issue that was discussed, litigated and
decided during the 18th century.</TE>
<TE>   Before 1710, the Stationers' Company, a guild of printers,
controlled the publication and sale of all works in England,
including those of authors who had been dead for thousands of years.
The Stationers scoffed at the idea that their monopoly should be in
any way limited. For one thing, they warned, if the system were
dismantled it would ruin the economy. Equally important, they said,
they had a moral right. No other property gets taken away after 10 or
20 years, they wrote in a broadside, so why should books? It's an
argument that the music and movie industries are still making today.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Statute of Anne in 1710 established a limited
copyright term of 14 years. The Stationers spent the next 60 years
alternately ignoring and challenging the law as they tried to
suppress the Scottish publishers, who followed their own rules and
were thus the Internet pirates of the era. But in a landmark case in
1774, the Stationers' monopoly was finally broken and the past was
freed.</TE>
<TE>   When the U.S. Constitution was drawn up several years later, this
history was still fresh. Jefferson wanted to put a ''restriction
against monopolies'' in the Bill of Rights, right alongside trial by
jury and freedom of the press. He, like the other framers, hated
concentrating power in the hands of a few, and didn't like the idea
of the past calling the shots on the future either. The earth belongs
to the living, Jefferson wrote Madison on Sept. 6, 1789: ''The dead
have neither powers nor rights over it.''</TE>
<TE>   The Eldred case, which could do so much to affect the nature of
copyrights, was sparked by a book that had been out of copyright for
a century. Emma, Annie and Bonnie Eldred, teenage triplets in Derry,
N.H., were assigned "The Scarlet Letter" in school. They didn't like
it. Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic tale of sex, shame and redemption
seemed fussy and obscure--a slog, in fact. The girls grumbled to
their father, a civilian computer contractor for the Navy who was
retired on disability and thus had lots of time to ponder the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Eldred wondered if the Internet could help, which wasn't as
inevitable a thought in 1995 as it would be now. He found the entire
text of the novel on the Net, but the typeface was so ugly and the
typographical errors so plentiful it was a strain to read. So Eldred
set about making his own online version. He scanned in the text,
proofreading it and adding annotations and glossary definitions and
features like an 1879 review of the novel by novelist Anthony
Trollope. And since "The Scarlet Letter" is more easily understood in
the context of Hawthorne's other works, Eldred scanned in "The House
of the Seven Gables," "Twice Told Tales," "The Marble Faun," "A
Wonder-Book" and just about everything else Hawthorne ever wrote,
annotating them as well.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was done, his site was getting about 3,000 visits a
day from students around the globe. It had been applauded by
Hawthorne scholars and won a commendation from the National Endowment
for the Humanities. Eldred had also seen Bonnie, Annie and Emma
graduate from high school. Never enticed by literature, they all
became dancers.</TE>
<TE>   Their father, though, had found a calling. There's an old Ray
Bradbury story about how, in a time of future suppression, literature
remains alive by people essentially becoming the classic writers,
literally embodying their work so it doesn't disappear. It was a tale
Eldred took to heart. He was Hawthorne, preserving his words and
presenting them to the future. He soon became Oliver Wendell Holmes,
Ring Lardner, William Dean Howells, Louisa May Alcott, Henry James,
as well as lesser-known late 19th and early 20th century masters,
including John Boyle O'Reilly, author of the forgotten 1890 classic
"Canoeing Sketches," and H.M. Tomlinson's definitive 1912 account of
life on a tramp steamer, "The Sea and the Jungle." Since all this
work was in the public domain, Eldred didn't have to track down the
author or ask anyone's permission or pay any fees. He was one small
part of a movement that was putting thousands of old books online,
for free, for the betterment of all. The Web was becoming a library.
No student would ever be confused by Hawthorne again.</TE>
<TE>   Then the politicians got involved. On Oct. 7, 1998, Congress
passed the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, named after the
late congressman and singer who believed, said his widow, Rep. Mary
Bono, that ''copyright should be forever.''</TE>
<TE>   Before the Bono act, copyright limits expired 75 years after
publication, which means that Eldred was only a few months away from
posting Hemingway's "Three Stories and 10 Poems," first published in
1923. The following years, the door would have slowly open on modern
culture: "The Great Gatsby," "The Maltese Falcon," early works by
Willa Cather and Wallace Stevens, "The Sun Also Rises," ''Winnie the
Pooh,'' ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' ''Show Boat,'' the best of Irving
Berlin, Ring Lardner and Virginia Woolf, the first talkies.</TE>
<TE>   And Mickey Mouse. The law when it comes to a creation such as
Mickey is complex because trademark enters the picture. Still,
Mickey, who first gained fame in ''Steamboat Willie'' in 1928, was
too lucrative a part of the Disney company, too tied up in its
corporate image, to risk. Disney donated money to 18 of the 25
sponsors of the Bono act in the House and Senate, and lobbied heavily
for its passage.</TE>
<TE>   By extending copyright protection for an additional 20 years, the
Bono act essentially functions as a dam, preventing any work from
entering the public domain until 2019--an estimated 400,000 books,
movies and songs. A handful of classics will remain available, in
print or on CDs or DVDs. Everything else will quietly
crumble--literally, in the case of the negatives of many films. And
for what? Eldred wondered. Just to keep up Disney profit margins and
enrich the heirs of Gershwin and Hemingway?</TE>
<TE>   It was a blow against the Internet, too. A traditional library
with physical books can stock and lend out whatever it wants, whether
the volume is in copyright or not; an Internet library like Eldred's
is restricted to material in the public domain. ''Companies don't
want you to be able to get anything on the Internet for free,''
Eldred says. ''They just want to sell you their own versions on
pay-per-view.''</TE>
<TE>   Annoyed and depressed by the Bono act, he contemplated civil
disobedience--publishing works from 1923 and '24 until he was
arrested. He announced he was shutting down his site. He wrote
letters. He fulminated. He became, in short, an activist, which is
how Larry Lessig, then teaching at Harvard, heard about him, sought
him out and filed a lawsuit on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Lessig was pregnant with her third child in late 1960
when she went to see ''Village of the Damned,'' a horror flick about
a rural town whose womenfolk are mysteriously impregnated by aliens.
The women give birth to a race of superhumans capable of reading
minds and imposing their will on others. Four decades later, when
Patricia contemplates her super-achieving son, the movie offers the
only reasonable explanation. ''I think he came from outer space.''</TE>
<TE>   There is something unearthly about Lessig. He grew up in
Williamsport, Pa., where his father, Jack, started a
steel-fabricating business that ultimately employed about 150 people.
Jack ticks off his son's most memorable qualities: Never indecisive,
never seemed to fail in anything, and whatever he got into, whether
it was starting a newspaper in the fourth grade or running a Jerry
Lewis-style telethon, he became the leader. ''He was always about
four or five steps ahead of everyone,'' says Jack.</TE>
<TE>   Lessig wanted someday to be president, and made a good start. He
was valedictorian of his high school class, president of the
Pennsylvania Teenage Republicans and the youngest member of any
delegation to the 1980 Republican convention. Lessig was a sophomore
at Penn by then, running a state campaign for a man named Jim
Ketcham. Despite Ronald Reagan's long coattails that year, Ketcham
lost.</TE>
<TE>   If the campaign cured him of the desire for a life in politics,
graduate studies in philosophy at Trinity College at Cambridge
University undercut his Republicanism. Studying under the long shadow
of Ludwig Wittgenstein, the dark prince of Cambridge philosophers,
Lessig learned that the way to influence a seemingly intractable
debate was by reframing it, getting both sides to confront something
they hadn't seen before. It's a technique that has served him well in
the Eldred case.</TE>
<TE>   While attending Yale Law School, Lessig did a summer internship at
the highly regarded Chicago law firm of Miller Shakman &amp; Hamilton.
''He was the best any of us had ever seen, and our collective
experience stretched back decades,'' remembers Barry Miller, now an
assistant U.S. attorney. That ecstatic recommendation helped get
Lessig a clerkship with Richard Posner, probably the best-known and
most influential appeals court judge in the country.</TE>
<TE>   ''He was rather like Ralph Nader, but brighter,'' says Posner. In
addition to Lessig's intensity and moral zeal, Posner was struck by
something else, something Nader doesn't exhibit: a restlessness.
''You know that novel by Somerset Maugham, 'The Razor's Edge'? The
fellow in that book was someone who was searching for something
meaningful, just like Larry. He ends up at a monastery in Nepal. He
doesn't want to or can't lead a normal life.''</TE>
<TE>   Lessig used his spare energy to travel, trying to see what other
people were taking for granted. He hitchhiked through communist
Eastern Europe, smuggled a mechanical heart valve for a Jewish
dissident into the Soviet Union by hiding it in his pants, read 30
classic novels in 30 days during a trip to Costa Rica. In the house
he and Bettina, a lawyer with Bay Area Legal Aid, bought and are
remodeling in San Francisco, his passport lies open on a table, as if
it might be needed any minute.</TE>
<TE>   The final rung on his educational ladder was the ultimate for any
law student: a Supreme Court clerkship, during the 1990-91 term. In
his interview with Antonin Scalia, Lessig coolly critiqued the
justice's recent rulings. Scalia, who likes to be challenged by his
clerks, gave Lessig the job. That annoyed Scalia's other clerks, all
of whom correctly suspected Lessig was not a judicial conservative.
''We weren't on speaking terms for much of the year,'' says one of
them, Chris Landau.</TE>
<TE>   Lessig first stepped onto the public stage in late 1997, when U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson appointed him a ''special
master'' in the Microsoft case. His task would have been to conduct
hearings and issue a recommendation to the court, which would have
given him an enormously influential role in the most important
antitrust case in a century. But Microsoft didn't want anyone to be a
special master, and certainly not Lessig: The company claimed he was
biased, and tried to prove it by digging up an old e-mail in which
Lessig had teasingly equated installing a Microsoft product on his
computer with selling his soul to the devil.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, an appeals court ruled against the involvement of a
special master. Lessig has forgiven Microsoft but not himself for
blowing his big moment.</TE>
<TE>   ''There's a great song by Sarah McLachlan called 'Angel'--'You
spend all your time waiting/ for that second chance/ for a break that
would make it OK . . . ' There's a certain sense I'm always feeling
that I'm making up for Microsoft. I just want the chance to do some
work, some real work, which could do some good.''</TE>
<TE>   After Clinton signed the Bono act, Lessig was in a hurry to
challenge it. He thought the retroactive extension so obviously
ridiculous, so clearly unconstitutional that he thought there would
be dozens of suits. He wanted to be first. Eldred v. Reno, as it then
was called, was filed Jan. 11, 1999, in U.S. District Court in
Washington. Opposition by the Hollywood studios, the music companies
and the book publishers was understandable. But even copyright
lawyers fundamentally sympathetic to Lessig didn't think much of the
case--which turned out to be the only challenge to the law.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Jaszi, an influential copyright scholar at American
University, was one of the early skeptics. ''It's not so much that we
thought it was a terrible idea but that it was just unprecedented,''
he says. ''Congress has been extending copyright for 180 years, and
this is the first time someone said it violated the Constitution.''</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge June Green confirmed the skeptics' fears.
Without letting the matter go to trial, she ruled in favor of the
U.S. government on Oct. 28, 1999. The appeals court split its Feb.
16, 2001, decision, ruling 2-1 that Congress had not overstepped its
bounds. Lessig appealed to the Supreme Court, but there seemed little
reason for hope.</TE>
<TE>   The high court postponed a decision on taking the Eldred case
three times last January. Lessig plunged into despair. He thought the
court would decline but needed to give one justice time to write an
opinion disagreeing with the decision. The likely candidate was
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who had written a Harvard Law Review
article in 1970 suggesting ''we should . . . hesitate to extend or
strengthen'' copyright.</TE>
<TE>   Larry and Bettina were in Hawaii. He slept a lot, stared into
space. ''He's a perfectionist. At everything,'' says Bettina. ''He
turned into an abyss of inconsolableness.''</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 19, the court decided to take the case, which meant at
least four justices decided it was worth hearing. The legal community
was surprised. Most major shifts by the Supreme Court are widely
anticipated, arriving in the wake of broad-based social movements and
multiple lawsuits spanning several years, says University of Chicago
legal historian Dennis Hutchinson. ''Solitary crusading individuals
are very unusual, and law professors acting on their own don't fare
very well either,'' he says. Hutchinson could recall only one case
involving law professors: Tileson v. Ullman, from 1943, an effort by
Yale law professors to make it legal for doctors to prescribe
contraceptives if a woman's health was in danger. The case was
dismissed on procedural grounds.</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment industry can only hope for a similar escape. The
Supreme Court, Jack Valenti says hopefully, is merely having some
"legal fun."</TE>
<TE>   The mere fact that the court took the case has affected the
entertainment business. Peermusic, a major independent music
publisher based in the Bay Area, has been putting a clause in catalog
acquisition contracts saying that the value will be cut if Bono is
struck down. But what's more problematic is a deal that was done
before the court took Eldred.</TE>
<TE>   Peermusic had acquired the catalog of Hoagy Carmichael and was
working to ''rejuvenate it,'' as they say in the business. The
studios were reacquainted with songs such as ''Stardust'' and
''Georgia on My Mind''; negotiations were underway with a store chain
to sell a line of products based on Carmichael's romantic allure; a
musical is in the works.</TE>
<TE>   But if Bono falls, ''Stardust'' goes in the public domain
immediately, and ''Georgia" follows in three years. ''There's no
incentive for us to do what we're doing if we don't have an
opportunity to earn renumeration,'' says chief executive Ralph Peer
II. ''I would predict interest in the Carmichael repertoire would
take a nose-dive.''</TE>
<TE>   Unless, of course, it increases as studios use work that they
earlier would have had to pay for and singers record tunes that are
suddenly freely available. Those who favor expirations for copyright
point to what happened with Frances Hodgson Burnett's "The Secret
Garden," the ageless tale of a boy and girl spiritually renewed after
discovering a hidden garden on a Yorkshire estate. First published in
1911, the work entered the public domain in 1986. There are now at
least 12 print versions of the book as well as two online versions.
There has been a TV adaptation, a musical, a big-budget Warner Bros.
movie, a cookbook and, undoubtedly, numerous student reworkings.</TE>
<TE>   No one owns "The Secret Garden" anymore, and consequently everyone
owns it. Probably the same would happen to Winnie the Pooh and
Mickey, but Disney would not give them up without a fight. "Winnie
the Pooh" was published in 1926, which means if the law is
overturned, it immediately comes out of copyright. This would shave
millions off the bottom line of its publisher, Dutton, a division of
the British conglomerate Pearson. What's less clear is how such a
decision would affect Disney, which controls the merchandising rights
and makes a billion dollars a year from Pooh fruit juice and other
items.</TE>
<TE>   Could someone start selling their own Pooh fruit juice? Disney
would say no, because it has a trademark on the Pooh characters, and
trademarks, unlike copyrights, never expire. But at least one appeals
court ruling, issued in Missouri in 1890, gives scant comfort to
Disney.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, a publisher had reissued a Webster's Dictionary from
1847 that had gone out of copyright. They were sued by the G. &amp; C.
Merriam Co., the original publishers of both that dictionary as well
as several subsequent Webster's. Merriam argued that their trademark
on the Webster's brand was being infringed by an upstart. Samuel
Miller, a Supreme Court justice who was sitting in on a circuit
court, slapped them down, writing that he didn't believe that ''a
party who has had the copyright of a book until it has expired may
continue that monopoly indefinitely, under the pretense that it is
protected by a trademark or something of that sort."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of August, Lessig was speaking before what he swore
would be his last audience, a gathering of the Free Software
Foundation in San Francisco. He had the Eldred case to attend to; he
was going to Japan for the fall semester; he was finally running out
of energy. But he agreed to be a guest at a dinner for big donors to
the foundation, and he spoke in a rented club for those who only had
$10 to contribute.</TE>
<TE>   Introducing Lessig, software activist Henri Poole says he isn't
even going to try to get people at the club to stop playing pinball
for the next half-hour because he knows that's impossible. Lessig
gamely begins anyway--warning, cajoling, trying to inspire.
''Everything that Washington proposes gets worse than the thing they
did before,'' he says.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Democratic Sen. Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina
introduced legislation that would require CD players, televisions and
computers to block unauthorized copyright material. Opponents dubbed
it the ''police state in a computer.''</TE>
<TE>   On July 25, Howard L. Berman, the Democratic representative whose
district includes North Hollywood and part of the San Fernando
Valley, co-sponsored the Peer-to-Peer Piracy Prevention Act. It would
allow anti-copyright vigilantism, giving Hollywood immunity for
''disabling, interfering with, blocking, diverting, or otherwise
impairing'' home computers that might hold illegal copyrighted
material.</TE>
<TE>   Not since the Licensing Act of 1662 reaffirmed the power of the
Stationers' Company to conduct searches and seizures of illegal books
and presses has the state given such authority to a private entity.
''Hollywood is terrified'' by the Eldred case, Lessig tells the
programmers, ''but whatever victory we can win in the courthouse they
can take away with new legislation.''</TE>
<TE>   He says he's pleading with them. ''This war is being waged whether
you participate or not. It will be won whether you're on the field or
not. The question is by whom.''</TE>
<TE>   After he is finished, a college student comes up and starts
talking in a sort of animated fury. This fellow lives in Berman's
district. What would be better, he wants to know: to talk sense into
Berman or go work for his opponent? ''What do we do?'' he says.
''When do we start?''</TE>
<TE>   A soldier has been enlisted for the battle. It's just one guy, and
who knows if he'll even follow through. But Lessig considers it a
successful evening.</TE>

<DH>How You Get From $1.75 Lunches to $2,000-a-Month Lofts
Depends on Many Things, Such as the Death of Urban Self-Loathing By

<LD>The windows are the same, though I never realized how grand they are,
how high and wide. Maybe that's because back then they were masked by
cheesy drapes. I probably never saw them this clean either. When no
one in the tour group was looking, I rested my hand on one, for
connection. Each night when my father and I left the office, we'd
open these windows for fresh air; in the morning, I'd flip on the AC
and pull them down to shut out the street's noise and stink. Even so,
a smell lingered, stale and depressing. The walls were dirty beige,
the carpet oatmeal, the furniture a utilitarian mix of file cabinets,
water cooler, battered wood desks. All gone now. Everything from
those days is gone, everything but the windows.</LD>
<LD>   From 1970 to 1984, the northwest corner of the seventh floor of
the Continental Building at 4th and Spring was my late father's
bankruptcy law office. It was the epitome of old downtown, a bleak
two-room suite in a seedy building just a block from the skid row
missions.</LD>
<TE>   Today it's one of three buildings re-imagined by maverick
developer Tom Gilmore, and at the epicenter of L.A.'s "downtown
renaissance." This is why, on a recent sunny morning, I found myself
on an apartment leasing tour of a place I never expected to see
again. In the Continental's lobby, a low '60s-era ceiling had been
torn away, revealing carved gold moldings. Hall floors were lined
with scuffed mosaic tile. My father's suite, 703, had been enlarged
to become loft apartment 702. Where his desk had been was a bedroom
area; where a bookcase held his legal texts was a small modern
kitchen with black granite counters. Exposed ducts and funky concrete
floors completed the upscale industrial look. There are 56 lofts for
rent in the Continental. No. 702, with 1,085 square feet, was going
for $2,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, when my father, at 48, left a mid-Wilshire law firm to
open his own practice, most attorneys with upper-middle-class
aspirations had offices in Beverly Hills or brand-new Century City.
He picked Spring Street because, he said, he liked being able to walk
to court. The truth was that he'd grown up poor, still lived in
perpetual fear of poverty, was terrified about starting over while
supporting a family, and space on Spring was cheap. (Not having to
pay for courthouse parking added to the savings.) Aesthetics weren't
on the radar.</TE>
<TE>   His first office was above Eagleson's Big &amp; Tall Shop, just off
3rd, a building so old it still had elevator operators. Seven years
later, he upgraded to the Continental. In 1904, when it was new and
known as the Braly Building, it had been grand. It was L.A.'s first
skyscraper, 12 stories, and the tallest building in town for 50
years. Spring Street was prosperous then, thick with banks and dubbed
"the Wall Street of the West." But when World War II defense plants
drew workers and, later, returning GIs to the city's edges, the
neighborhood began to collapse. The redevelopment of Bunker Hill
finished the job. By the '70s, the Continental was an outpost in a
ghost town.</TE>
<TE>   I spent some of the longest hours of my life in that building. One
of the ways my father economized was by not hiring a secretary, and
on Saturdays I went downtown with him to file and type. Later, when I
was 21, unemployed, directionless and reeling from the loss of a
boyfriend to a cult, he gave me a job. To a suburban beach kid,
Spring Street at first seemed a terrifying netherworld of grime and
garbage, stumbling, reeking winos and shrieking street-corner
preachers--things that you didn't yet see on the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   Next to the Continental was a fleabag hotel with a coffee shop
called Jeffrey's that my father favored because it, too, was
cheap--maybe $1.75 for a grilled cheese sandwich and a cup of weak
coffee. Every time we went in, I wanted to run. The gray-faced
patrons who slumped around the tables--like the street people,
Eagleson's elevator operators and the shiny-suited businessmen who
kept offices at the Continental--were characters straight out of a
Nathanael West novel, men and women so clearly beaten by life that
not even a budding poet like me could romanticize them.</TE>
<TE>   I think my father pitied these people, but his main feeling toward
downtown was frank contempt. He was there only for reasons of
economy; to him, the beauty of L.A. was its scrubbed suburban space,
not the kind of aged, urban landscape he'd left behind in New York.</TE>
<TE>   He retired in 1984. Just before he cleared out of the Continental,
I took pictures; in my favorite, he's looking pensively out of one of
the tall windows over Spring Street. Shortly after, a developer with
renovation plans bought the building, gutted it, then ran out of
money. For years it just sat there, trash-strewn, boarded up. One of
the few times we happened to be downtown together, I drove my father
past it. He nodded with grim satisfaction. "What a piece of crap," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   My father never knew that during the later years I worked with him
I'd gone out for lunch one day, actually looked around and up, and
had been staggered by the beauty of the buildings around me. How had
I missed this? After that, whenever I could, I'd take walks to stare
and marvel. I discovered Grand Central Market, Angels Flight, strange
nooks and crannies--somewhere on 7th, I think, a hidden outdoor
espresso bar where I would sit, drink cups of strong coffee and
pretend I was overseas. I saw L.A.'s urban heart and fell in love,
and for years I came back: to the self-conscious artiness of Gorky's,
the frenetic clatter of Vickman's, Broadway's blaring music and the
crowded butcher shops on North Spring, where I could buy freshly
slaughtered chickens from Chinese men fluent in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Today, middle-aged and encumbered with husband, child, large dog
and truckloads of possessions, I'm hardly a candidate for tenancy in
the Continental or its sister buildings, the Hellman and San
Fernando. The occupied units I was allowed to see during the leasing
tour were spaces crammed with lurid art and neon, overseen by
profoundly young, hip men and women, all black glasses, faux leopard
and tattoos. Later, when I met with Trish Keefer, general manager of
Gilmore Associates' Old Bank District (and wife of Tom), the
demographics she read from rental applications sounded like an
advertiser's fantasy: Here were students from the Southern California
Institute of Architecture (also newly based downtown) and USC, and
grown-ups who worked as chefs and Web consultants, or in the
clothing, music, entertainment and fiber-optic industries. Average
age: 25 to 35.</TE>
<TE>   But I get why these people are here--why, as Keefer puts it, they
think living downtown is "so cool." Art galleries, a clothing and
general store, and restaurants are in the works nearby. There are 230
lofts in the three Gilmore buildings, with more soon to
come--including in the hotel that once housed Jeffrey's. I imagine
the promise of downtown loft life is like the chance to inhabit some
ultra-groovy TV drama: Young people meet in corridors and coffee
shops, share ambitions, affairs, tragedies, triumphs--all set against
a colorful urban backdrop and given added intensity by the sense of
being on the cutting edge.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not convinced that the new downtown will last, if the
Continental's tenants will stay once the novelty wears off. But the
fact that it might also fills me with ambivalence. I hate that places
and neighborhoods don't exist until the well-off discover them. I
worry what continued upscaling will mean to the poor and
working-class people who already call downtown home. I wonder how
much this new juxtaposition of wealth and desperation will raise
L.A.'s heartlessness quotient--really, doesn't the ability to enjoy
dining at a ground-floor 4th Street bistro require one to see right
through the homeless outside the plate-glass windows?</TE>
<TE>   And on a basic level, $2,000 seems a lot to pay for concrete
floors and a bathroom without windows. (As I looked over the
Continental's rental prices, which ran as high as $6,000 for a
2,750-square-foot penthouse with private terrace, I could hear my
father gasping and whipping out his asthma inhaler. "They want what?"
he wheezed.)</TE>
<TE>   But it probably doesn't matter what I think. The San Fernando,
Hellman and Continental, which opened last September, are all fully
rented. In No. 702, an entertainment industry couple, who moved from
the mid-city with their dog, are now opening and closing those tall
windows. I wonder if they think about their apartment's history or
sense the presence of those who came before. Even if they do, I'm
certain they'll never see one ghost--that of the tall, thin lawyer
who spent so many hours there: Even in death, he'd choose another
place to be. And for that reason alone, they'll belong downtown in a
way he never did.</TE>

<HD>Flower Power</HD>
<DH>Artichoke Buds Are a Roman Staple and a California Classic</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID DOWNIE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1960s San Francisco, "flower power" meant more to my family than
daisies in rifle barrels. It meant flowers to eat: zucchini blossoms,
caper buds, nasturtium and fava bean flowers, wisteria and acacia
blooms and, especially, artichokes.</LD>
<LD>   I recall exactly when and where I learned that artichokes are
immature inflorescences, the scaly buds of edible flowers seemingly
from some lost saurian age. It was in 1964, near Castroville, a
"Grapes of Wrath" farm town in Steinbeck country. My father had
driven us down Highway 1 from San Francisco, past Santa Cruz, to a
fishing pier at Moss Landing. Over the sandy plain east of the
highway spread fields of spiky plants bristling with maces. The air
smelled of beach fires and smoking oil. From a flyblown roadside
stand my mother, a transplanted Italian, bought something fried and
began to nibble. "Flowers," my father, the gardener, said. "Your
mother is eating fried artichokes. If you let artichokes grow, they
look like big purple thistles."</LD>
<LD>   Shortly afterward we moved from San Francisco to my mother's
native Rome. The grocery stores on every ancient street sold bottled
artichoke hearts. The scent of artichokes crisping in olive oil
wafted from trattoria terraces facing Baroque fountains. Campo de'
Fiori, the open market where my mother shopped, reminded me of the
familiar fields of Castroville, festooned with spiky artichokes.</LD>
<TE>   Italians call artichokes carciofi. In Rome, the native carciofi
romaneschi are a cult vegetable, with as many different names as
there are sizes. Street markets provide nearly year-round thrills for
artichoke aficionados like me. Small carciofi are carciofini, big
ones from the plant's main stem are called cimaroli, mamme or
mammole, depending on what neighborhood you come from. Medium-size
artichokes are called either figli, children, or braccioli, from the
plants' arms, le braccia.</TE>
<TE>   Romans eat romaneschi and other artichokes raw, pickled, fried,
braised, fricasseed and barbecued, alone or in sauces and stews, in
frittatas, with roasts, fish, squid and shellfish. They distill them
into green-black liqueurs such as Cynar or Fernet-Branca, which are
believed to possess miraculous curative powers. "Have a spoonful," my
mother would say, chasing after me whenever I felt unwell.</TE>
<TE>   From Steinbeck country to the suburbs of Rome, artichoke festivals
celebrate the vegetable's versatility. Castroville calls itself the
world's artichoke capital and hosts a two-day artichoke festival that
draws about 15,000. Similarly, dusty old Sezze, south of Rome, and
hayseed Ladispoli, north of the city, each claim artichoke capital
status. The latter two boast weeklong carciofo jamborees that attract
hundreds of thousands visitors.</TE>
<TE>   In Castroville, folks compete to see how many artichokes they can
gobble, and there's an artichoke-burrito prize. In Sezze and
Ladispoli, artichoke maestros wield curved-blade paring knives in
speed-trimming competitions, while cooks transform carciofi into
everything from classic antipasti to artichoke-heart gelato.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later someone in or near Rome was going to have to marry
artichokes with carbonara, another culinary cult favorite. Will the
combination play in Castroville, I wonder?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vegetarian Carbonara with Artichoke Hearts</TE>
<TE>   Serves 4</TE>
<TE>   1 lemon, preferably organic, halved</TE>
<TE>   2 medium artichoke hearts, fresh or frozen, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup hot water</TE>
<TE>   4 large eggs, at room temperature</TE>
<TE>   2 heaping tablespoons freshly grated Pecorino Romano</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground black pepper</TE>
<TE>   Kosher salt or coarse sea salt</TE>
<TE>   1 pound spaghetti</TE>
<TE>   1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano in a bowl</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground black pepper</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Juice one half of lemon into a medium-size bowl of cold water and
submerge artichokes. Use remaining lemon half to rub the artichokes
as you work.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large, nonreactive frying pan. Add artichokes
and stir, sauteing until browned, 3-4 minutes. Add 1/4 cup hot water,
cover and steam until tender, about 2 minutes. Remove the lid and
boil off remaining water. Remove from heat and allow to cool, 3-4
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Separate yolks of 2 eggs. Put yolks and cream into a small mixing
bowl. Crack remaining eggs into the bowl and beat thoroughly,
incorporating the Pecorino Romano. Add pepper to taste. Pour egg
mixture into the warm frying pan and stir. Boil 5 quarts of water.
Add pinch of salt. Add pasta, stir and cover pot. Return to a boil,
remove lid and cook pasta uncovered until al dente. Drain and
transfer the pasta immediately to the frying pan with the
egg-and-artichoke mixture. Stir vigorously until thoroughly coated.
Cover frying pan. Let sit for 1 minute. Serve with pepper and freshly
grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.</TE>

<LD>Lee Bixler can still hear the whistle on the Helms bakery truck that
echoed through his childhood in Bakersfield. "My sister and I used to
fight over who would flag down the Helms man," says the proprietor of
the Helms Museum at the Antique Guild in the former Helms Bakeries
building in Culver City.</LD>
<LD>   The museum celebrates the days when mid-century Southern
California was fertile pasture for bow-tied "Helmsmen" selling bread
and sweets in their butter yellow panel trucks from San Diego to
Fresno and San Bernardino to Santa Barbara. For Bixler, 56, the
whistle is still blowing: The museum showcases highlights from
Bixler's massive Helmsiana collection: photos of Helms Rose Parade
floats, a wooden baker's box on wheels, bread racks, fruitcake tins,
cardboard bread loaves. A framed letter dated 1948 states how much
the King and Queen of England enjoyed Helms bread. The museum also
displays a 1948 Divco Helms truck on loan from the Petersen
Automotive Museum.</LD>
<LD>   Then there's Bixler's Helms uniform ("Khaki pants, white shirt,
blue bow tie, black belt, black shoes!"), which he wears when
attending car shows in his restored 1962 Helms bakery truck. He
delights in showing off one of the Viewmasters used by Helms drivers
to pitch wedding cakes in 3-D. Bixler is currently adding display
cases for his employee pins, invoices (100 pounds of flour for $3.48)
and Helms cardigan sweater.</LD>
<TE>   Paul Helms founded the bakery in 1931 and expanded it into more
than 200,000 square feet in the Venice Boulevard building that now
houses the Antique Guild. Bixler says the company was an official
supplier for the 1932 Olympics. "I refer to [Helms] as the P.T.
Barnum of bread," Bixler says, adding that Helms abhorred the term
"truck" and once stated, "Garbage is delivered in trucks. My bread is
delivered in coaches." The company peaked when Helms bread blasted
off on Apollo 11 for the July 20, 1969, moon landing (orange stickers
on view at the museum boast "First bread on the moon"), but Helms
shut down the bakery in August 1969 rather than allow his company to
unionize, Bixler says.</TE>
<TE>   Bixler went to work at the old Helms building in 1977 as a planner
and display director for the Antique Guild. He purchased the Antique
Guild business in 1994 and receives free space for the museum from
the building's owners. He started his collection in 1989 with a
purchase of photos showing the bakery's construction. Two items
continue to elude Bixler. "A 1932 Helms Olympic Village made of
cardboard," he says. "I've tried twice and been outbid. I'd also love
a miniature loaf of [real] Helms bread."</TE>
<TE>   Bixler stays in touch with former Helms employees and fellow
collectors as well as the many fans who still pine for their favorite
Helms cookies, doughnuts and cream puffs. "People still talk about
them," he says. "My grandmother loved the applesauce cake.''</TE>

<DH>A Design Team Updates a Lap Pool and Revives a Forgotten
Fountain in a Mediterranean-Inspired Santa Monica Garden</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN HEEGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On paper, the Santa Monica acre had it all: swimming pool, guest
cottage, tennis court, view and enough land to get lost in. In
reality, it felt cramped, pedestrian and hard to use, full of small
spaces that didn't relate to each other or to the house, which the
owners bought in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   A large Mediterranean from the '20s, the house exuded historic
charm. But even before a remodel by the architectural firm Rios
Associates added a den, a children's bedroom and other
family-friendly features, it seemed to tower over its grounds and
make their shortcomings obvious. ''There was no mystery, nothing
really to discover,'' says Mark Tessier, a landscape designer who
works for Rios and was involved in the garden's transformation.</LD>
<LD>   Despite ficus and magnolia trees, an entry court lacked a feeling
of enclosure, and its plants--mostly ferns and camellias--seemed
paltry beside the house. The rear yard was taken up with paving and
an oddly angled 1960s pool. At the far edge, where the view of a golf
course and parklands should have been, an ivy thicket blocked the
way, and beyond that, the lot ended in a scrubby, overgrown hill.</LD>
<TE>   In lieu of these bits and pieces, the design team--which included
Tessier, Mark Rios and Carol Lowry--created a sequence of gardens
with distinct yet related moods. In the front court, they built their
scheme around existing plants, moving trees and adding more to tuck
the house more firmly into landscape. At ground level, they planted
dark-leafed acanthus, abutilon and philodendron among the ferns, with
potted cannas and bergenias as accents. To enhance the feeling of a
tropical glade, they revived an old fountain with fresh paint,
replaced the tile around its base with sandstone flags and added
baby's tears, campanula and true geranium.</TE>
<TE>   Liquid comfort is a larger theme in the new rear garden, where the
designers swapped the '60s pool for a raised, mirror-like lap pool.
Decorator Michael Smith, who did the home's interiors, chose the tile
and pool color, and set lanterns around its edge to light the water
on summer nights. Nearby, more abutilons grow, but in this sunny
spot, they're paired with lavender, westringia and coppery dodonaea.</TE>
<TE>   A newly planted tapestry wraps up the hill, unfolding along paths
and stairs that Rios and his colleagues created. The idea, say the
designers, was to pick colors from local hills--grays, oranges and
blues--and mix them in seasonally shifting planting swaths.
Westringia and dodonaea reappear, with purple echium in spring and
orange lion's tail and Mexican marigold in summer. Hillside terraces
include vegetable and cutting gardens, too, as well as places to sit
in the shade of trees.</TE>
<TE>   The designers worked magic in other ways, transforming a service
yard off the house into a lemon orchard, revamping an outdoor dining
room and evoking drama with fragrant plants: wisteria, jasmine,
potted heliotrope. Now, you really can get lost here, not only in
sights and smells but in clues about what lies beyond each corner--a
visual trick that could make the smallest garden seem endless.</TE>

<AU>STEVE CLOW</AU>
<BD>Steve Clow is a Times assistant National editor.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of the hundreds of football games he has coached, this one sticks
with Don Markham the way you'd remember a haywire cash machine
spitting out stacks of twenties. It was 1986, and his Riverside
Ramona High Rams were a sloppy bunch. ''We went out there with 19 or
20 kids . . . I had no more linemen. I had to grab a PE student and
put him in for a week, and I remember he wore sweats under his pants.
We were ragtag and we looked terrible. And we played a real good
football team.''</LD>
<LD>   The opponent was Damien High of La Verne, and even one of
Markham's assistant coaches ''thought we were going to get killed by
this team.'' By halftime, however, Ramona had built a 52-0 lead, and
the nervous assistant had changed his tune, telling Markham giddily:
''Coach, we oughta go to jail for what we're about to do here.''
Ramona won 68-12, which Markham recalls with amazement: ''We, with
not much, just annihilated them. Our system was rolling.''</LD>
<LD>   And it has rolled ever since.</LD>
<TE>   Markham's system is called the double wing, a blend of the old--a
Vince Lombardi-style running attack--with the downright
prehistoric--an intricate shell-game deception from the
leather-helmet era. It bears little resemblance to the pass-intensive
West Coast offense that now dominates the sport: no wide receivers,
nine men tightly bunched at the line of scrimmage, constant motion
and a quarterback who blocks on almost every play. Telegenic glamour
boys need not apply.</TE>
<TE>   Double-wing advocates say that in his years of tinkering within
football's DNA, Markham--unlike most high school coaches--has
actually managed to decode a few of its genetic secrets, creating a
virulent new offensive strain. He unveiled it for that 1986 season,
deciding it was time to see if the touchdowns came as easily when the
chalkboard Xs and Os were real, live, imperfect teenagers banging
helmets on Friday nights. Success was instantaneous, and contagious.
It has made the former cop something of a guru among youth and high
school football coaches around the nation.</TE>
<TE>   After four years at Ramona he took his act to Bandon, Ore., where
he inherited a team that had not had a winning season since 1968. The
Bandon team began scoring 70 and 80 points in a game. State athletic
officials responded by enacting a 45-point ''mercy'' provision that
some still call ''the Markham rule.'' Returning to Southern
California in 1994, Markham guided Bloomington High to a perfect 14-0
season in which it broke the national high school scoring record
(since eclipsed), averaging 63 points per game. It was a moment of
glory for the Inland Empire school, which held onto Markham for three
more seasons. Overall, his double-wing teams have won 143 games while
losing 38.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of high schools play football; a few hundred have
adopted the double wing, according to those who have promoted it
through Web sites, videos, clinics and a book. Advocates say it is
easy to teach and enables teams with poor or mediocre talent to
compete with stronger rivals, giving long-suffering programs a chance
for instant success. ''I guess cult is a bad word in your part of the
world, but it is cultish,'' says Jack Tourtillotte, principal and
offensive coordinator at Maine's Boothbay Region High, the 2001 class
C state champs. ''I have coached 31 years, and I would never run
anything different.''</TE>
<TE>   It is a triumph of system over athleticism, relying on gutty,
hard-nosed kids who will buy into it in the absence of a roster full
of future college stars--even if the buying-into part doesn't always
occur right away. "My sense is that if [Markham] goes to a new city,
a lot of the kids are ambivalent at best," says Gary Etcheverry, head
coach of the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts and a
longtime Markham fan. "He, in almost every case, is wildly successful
in that first game. Kids who were ambivalent walk off the field in a
daze."</TE>
<TE>   But as the offense has grown, so has the backlash. Parents
complain that their sons' individual talents as passers or receivers
are obscured by the relentless running plays. Fans say the action is
difficult to follow, and even some double-wing coaches consider it
boring or inelegant. In the lockstep, TV-influenced world of football
theory, the double wing is hopelessly uncool.</TE>
<TE>   ''Generally, it's not in vogue. You won't see it on Sunday
afternoon or on Monday Night Football. To be quite truthful, it's
rather boring,'' says Phil Bravo, head coach at Monarch High School
outside Boulder, Colo. And he loves the double wing, having won 11
league championships in 16 years. So does Jerry Vallotton, assistant
football coach at Foothill High near Redding and author of ''The
Toss,'' a double-wing how-to dedicated in part to Markham. Vallotton
acknowledges that the offense is ''about as artistic as sumo
wrestling.''</TE>
<TE>   The sharpest attacks have come from coaches who call the
humiliating scores an assault on sportsmanship, or who mock it as a
''Pop Warner offense''--derivative, simplistic, outdated and a flop
at football's more evolved levels.</TE>
<TE>   ''If you're in my league, I hope you'll run the double wing. I'll
send a limousine,'' scoffs Jim Walker, head coach at Redlands High,
whose team shut down Markham's Rialto squad, 30-7, in last year's
regular season Division I finale. ''When you get up to the levels
where you have 11 studs, and I've got 11 studs, you don't see this
offense. We had success against Rialto because we're big, fast and
play for four quarters.''</TE>
<TE>   Though Markham didn't realize it at the time, that defeat would be
one of his final games at Rialto. The principal fired him in May
after two winning seasons--the first in the school's 10-year
history--after he refused to commit to returning this fall. He had
begun looking elsewhere, claiming administrators had failed to
deliver on promises for a stadium and lights--basics that many lesser
coaches take for granted.</TE>
<TE>   But it would be out of character for Markham to remain anywhere
for very long, given that he has changed jobs nine times in the last
20 years. While some of those moves were unrelated to football, it's
fair to say he lacks a survival gene that might have assured him a
long tenure somewhere, had that been the overriding goal.</TE>
<TE>   A slicker politician might have avoided the temptation to call
some of his players who fought with teammates and got bad grades ''a
bunch of jerks,'' as Markham said in The Times last December. A
smoother operator might have retracted that statement, rather than
reiterate it, in a later interview, while still employed at Rialto.
(''That was the first nail,'' he says. ''I said they were jerks. Just
said it like it was. I didn't lie.'') Someone bent on ingratiating
himself with administrators might applaud their pressure-packed
efforts to raise academic test scores, rather than point
out--correctly--that ''as a PE teacher, I can't do much about that.''</TE>
<TE>   All of which helps account for the bull-and-bear duality of the
past few months: In January, a Canadian pro team was angling to have
this masterly innovator rebuild its offense; by early July, he was
adrift--fired by Rialto then snubbed by Bloomington (2001 record:
0-9), which was looking for a new coach and which Markham had put in
the record books just a few years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Even in elementary school, Markham knew he wanted to coach. Now
63, he was a receiver at Van Nuys' Birmingham High, joined the Navy
after graduation in 1957, then resumed playing at Los Angeles Valley
College and San Fernando Valley State College (now Cal State
Northridge). He set aside plans to become a PE teacher when he
responded to a TV commercial in 1965 seeking hundreds of new recruits
for the Los Angeles Police Department. As a patrolman assigned to
West Los Angeles, he was dispatched one night in August 1969 to the
home of film director Roman Polanski and actress Sharon Tate shortly
after the Manson gang had completed its rampage. ''It's something you
try to forget,'' Markham says.</TE>
<TE>   He had begun coaching a San Fernando Valley youth team on his days
off, leading to a side job at Los Angeles Baptist High School, which
won a CIF championship in his second season using a precursor to the
double wing. ''I asked the lieutenant for a Friday night off because
we had a playoff game,'' Markham says. ''He said no, and told me I
had to choose between police work and football. I told him I just
did.''</TE>
<TE>   This path has taken him to several points in Southern California,
two stints in Oregon and several summers coaching in Europe. Home
these days is an 18-acre slice of mountaintop overlooking Moreno
Valley, which would make a dandy compound for double-wing cultists.
Markham--a 250-pounder who looks like Lt. Kojak but comes off like
Lt. Columbo--lives in a comfortable ranch house there with his wife
of 39 years, Linda; they have three children. Preoccupied and
technology-intolerant, he struggles with TV remotes, never uses a
computer, has no cell phone and hesitates on dates, places--even
grandchildren (there are seven, ''I think.'') Linda, a former
teacher, is the cheerful organizer who gently corrects Don on certain
details, collates news clippings, maintains the Web site, shoots the
coaching videos, responds to e-mails and makes the sandwiches for
groups of visiting coaches paying $300 for a daylong master class.</TE>
<TE>   While nonbelievers argue that the double wing works only at small
or medium-sized schools, at least one member of the profession's more
elevated ranks is sold on the system's broader viability. ''People
say it's primitive. I don't agree. I take offense at the idea that
it's just for high schools and below,'' says Etcheverry, who planned
to hire Markham as his offensive coordinator this season, only to
have the deal fall apart after word leaked out that the Argonauts
were eyeing a high school coach.</TE>
<TE>   It works like this: seven players--the center, flanked by two
guards, two tackles and two tight ends--are bundled tightly along the
line of scrimmage, standing virtually shoe to shoe, rather than the
typical foot or so apart. This impairs a defender's ability to see
who has the ball and effectively widens the playing field, giving the
ball carrier more space to run. From this alignment, Markham runs
plays that involve a herd of blockers--guards, tackles, even the
quarterback--overrunning a proscribed area, Pamplona-like.</TE>
<TE>   Just off the hip of each tight end is a wingback--a quick, elusive
athlete who would play running back in a traditional offense. The
quarterback lines up directly behind the center, usually holding the
ball only long enough to pitch it to a wingback in motion or hand it
to the fullback--the lone runner in the backfield.</TE>
<TE>   The space on either side of an offensive player on the line of
scrimmage is called a gap, and this formation creates 10 of them.
Each presents a dilemma for the defense--a slit through which a
runner might squirm toward daylight. With 11 defensive players
responsible for plugging 10 gaps, there is little margin for error,
and overloading defenders at one spot leaves others vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most coaches, whose quarterbacks use a constantly shifting
cadence, Markham's swift snap count is the same on virtually every
play: ''Down . . . ready set go.'' Such predictability lulls the
defense into a rhythm that can be exploited when the offense needs a
timely offside penalty. ''He can pick up five yards almost at will,''
Etcheverry says. Each play is an eruption of chaos within a tight
cluster of crisscrossing bodies. Somewhere is a ball carrier; picking
him out of the scrum and tackling him is the problem, especially with
as many as nine boys blocking.</TE>
<TE>   ''The goal is to be able to get four yards on a bad play,''
Markham says.</TE>
<TE>   The double wing tilts the odds the way card counting can help a
skillful gambler, Etcheverry says. ''Blackjack is one of the only
games I'm aware of where the house can tell you to leave . . . that
you know this game better than we do. They can't do that in football
as long as you're abiding by the rules, and [Markham] does--and he
uses them to his advantage.''</TE>
<TE>   For the winning side, the results can be enthralling. But oh, the
humanity.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Baker revisits a bad place in recalling the night in 1990 when
his Gold Beach, Ore., team met Bandon and its first-year coach.
Markham's team won, 84-8, the most lopsided game in the history of
Oregon prep football. ''Talking to you I still get heated about it,''
he says. ''We were just decimated. It probably cost me my job at Gold
Beach. It destroyed all credibility I had as a coach.''</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, ''I thought we did a better job, and they beat us 73-6,''
Baker says, acknowledging a sense of relief when another Oregon
school lost by an even wider margin to a team running Markham's
system. ''So I no longer had the worst loss in Oregon football. Now
I'm second and third.''</TE>
<TE>   Baker says he respects Markham, even likes him, allowing that ''to
a football purist,'' the double wing is ''a beautiful thing.'' But he
contends that Markham and other coaches harm players and even the
game itself by failing to take steps to keep scores down. ''My
harshness toward him is when the score is so out of hand, what are we
doing to promote football, to promote sportsmanship?'' says Baker,
now head coach at Oregon's Clackamas High. ''I play to win, but I
never want to win at the expense of the dignity of my opponent, or of
young people at the high school level.''</TE>
<TE>   Markham says he never tries to make the other team look bad and
tries ''everything in our power to make games look real,'' while
avoiding obvious hold-down moves that would also embarrass an
opponent, such as punting on first down or playing an unskilled
lineman at quarterback who is sure to fumble. But he doesn't
apologize for the scores, either.</TE>
<TE>   ''You'd have to know me. I've been beat bad before, well, maybe
not worse than 40-0 or something, but I absolutely take no exception
if somebody beats me 80-0. I would congratulate them. I don't care
how bad we get beat. I get upset that I couldn't do a better job of
coaching. But I don't get mad at them.''</TE>
<TE>   Hugh Wyatt encountered Markham in the 1980s when both were guiding
Finnish teams in a league comparable to American community-college
football. Wyatt converted to the double wing not long after a 73-0
defeat by Markham's Helsinki Roosters, and soon implemented his own
stylized version at high schools in the Pacific Northwest with
considerable success.</TE>
<TE>   He has since quit coaching to travel the country year-round
consulting, leading clinics and selling his coaching videos. He
hasn't spoken with Markham in years--''we don't have a lot to do with
each other''--but is careful to credit him and considers him a
"brilliant coach." ''Frequently in football there is the inventor,
and there is the popularizer,'' says Wyatt, who played for Yale in
the late '50s. ''Hundreds of schools have adopted the double wing. At
least 300 are running what you could call my version, plus at least
that many youth teams . . . . I'll never achieve what [Markham] has
achieved as a coach, but I've been able to market this.''</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Eien's double-wing moment of truth came in 1989, when his
alma mater, Brethren Christian in Huntington Beach, suffered a 74-0
clocking by Whittier Christian. Eien was coaching elsewhere, but
returned to Brethren the following season as an assistant and today
is head coach. Rather than switch over to ''the dark side,'' he vowed
to find an antidote for it. ''I was fully embarrassed,'' Eien says.
''I started big-time investigating the whole thing.'' That meant
going behind enemy lines to attend Markham clinics, endlessly
screening game films and even installing the system at the junior
varsity level to help demystify it for the varsity. He outlined his
strategies in the January 2002 issue of Gridiron Strategies, a
Wisconsin-based coaching publication. His article on how to stop the
double wing quickly became the magazine's most requested reprint.
Says Eien: ''A lot of people are anti. They don't think it's real
football.''</TE>
<TE>   Such criticism raises the heretical notion that Lombardi
(''Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing.'') and Al Davis
(''Just win, baby.'') might have got it wrong--that football has its
aesthetic side, and that an unentertaining victory isn't much better
than a defeat. Wyatt recalls Pepper Rodgers, the onetime UCLA coach,
telling him that even though he was gaining yardage successfully with
the confounding wishbone formation, ''the alumni hate it because they
can't find the football.''</TE>
<TE>   Winning ugly didn't bother at least some fans in Bloomington, who
complained loudly in July when Markham was bypassed in favor of
Stewart Roper of Palo Verde High in Blythe, Calif. Roper quit days
later, sending Bloomington officials scurrying back to Markham, who
was poised to become offensive coordinator at Eastern Oregon
University. He accepted Bloomington's offer to return, but there was
a catch: He and his assistant coaches would have to fulfill the
school's commitment to take part in a CIF-sponsored sportsmanship
seminar called "Pursuing Victory with Honor," lest Bloomington resume
partying like it's 1994.</TE>
<TE>   So while some coaches embrace the double wing, others recoil in
horror, and still others plot countermeasures, the guy who dreamed it
up is back at the school where the system attained its greatest
lethality. Starting this month, he'll be trying to add to his career
total of 274 victories and five CIF championships; how long he
remains this time is anyone's guess. Markham just needs to coach, as
he knew 50 years ago. ''I can't think of a better life than being out
in the fresh air, lifting weights with the kids, getting kids ready
to play as a team. I don't want to give up right now as far as I can
see.''</TE>
<TE>   He even hopes to emulate Amos Alonzo Stagg, one of football's
founders--the legendary father of the forward pass who lived past 100
years of age and coached nearly that long. ''Who was that guy . . . .
He was up teaching punting at 98.''</TE>
<TE>   Markham knew the story, he just needed a little help with the
name.</TE>

<LD>Justified or not, there's no shaking L.A.'s reputation as a "Blade
Runner"-esque shrine to impermanence, where mini-malls supplant Art
Deco movie palaces and freeway projects erase rows of stately
Victorian homes. At a juncture when preservation is a hot
topic--following the destruction of two Rudolph Schindler homes last
year, in San Marino and on Catalina Island--the recently published
"Los Angeles Then and Now" adds thought-provoking material to the
case file.</LD>
<LD>   For the L.A. entry in a series issued by San Diego-based Thunder
Bay Press, author Rosemary Lord scoured the archives of such sources
as the California Historical Society, USC and the Los Angeles Public
Library. Black-and-whites from the late 19th and early 20th centuries
of 70 sites such as the Cathedral of St. Vibiana, Grauman's Chinese
Theatre and the Santa Monica Pier are presented side-by-side with
21st century perspectives by photographer Simon Clay. "The aim was to
duplicate [the old photographs] down to the exact angle," Lord says.
"It was important to [shoot] the current scene as closely as possible
to the archive so people could draw their own conclusions."</LD>
<TE>   In spots, the volume is a heartening rebuttal to that
here-today-gone-tomorrow L.A. stereotype. The plates of the Art Deco
Bullocks Wilshire building, for example, are distinguishable chiefly
by the absence of Model Ts in the contemporary photo. Similarly, the
before-and-afters of Union Station's 1939 Mission-style facade could
be mirror images.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, development's implacable momentum has destroyed
plenty of treasures. The often surreal past-and-present
juxtapositions include the original Brown Derby restaurant on
Wilshire Boulevard, a celebrity hangout and tourist draw
unrecognizable today. The hat-shaped restaurant was razed to make way
for a strip mall that now houses Stone Age 2000, a prehistoric-themed
restaurant and bar. Nearby, the Hollywood &amp; Highland entertainment
complex looms at the spot once occupied by the Hollywood Hotel, where
Rudolph Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks reveled. And a Virgin
Megastore has replaced the legendary Schwab's Pharmacy where Brigitte
Bardot and James Dean sipped sodas.</TE>
<TE>   For Lord, it was alterations to the Venice landscape that proved
the most heartbreaking. "They've actually hacked buildings in half,"
says the English native, a 20-year L.A. resident. "I'd be looking at
these elegant Italian colonnades and wonder, 'Where's the rest of
it?' It's so tragic." One such casualty is the beautifully detailed
St. Mark's Hotel, established in 1904 by entrepreneur Abbot Kinney; a
portion was sawed off a half century or so later to make room for a
parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Lord started on the project just prior to the biggest
landscape-changing event of recent times, and subtle aftereffects of
the Sept. 11 attacks jar present-day tableaux throughout the book: an
American flag hanging from the facade of Hotel Casa Del Mar in Santa
Monica, barricades at the entrance to Paramount Studios. Sites such
as Los Angeles City Hall and the Los Angeles Times are missing
because the photographer couldn't get near the buildings by deadline
due to police roadblocks.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the book may benefit from another ripple effect,
namely new appreciation for the city's architectural heritage. "There
was a huge difference before and after Sept. 11," Lord says. "Before
it was, 'That's just an old building.' Then all of a sudden even the
general public seemed aware of preservation."</TE>

<LD>Painter Shelley Cassidy spent two months on a mural featuring
employees and customers at La Cantina bar and Cinnabon restaurant at
the Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International
Airport. Cassidy did her best to render an authentically detailed
Mexican cantina under the critical eyes of the "model" employees who
doubled as unofficial consultants. The work has dramatically improved
the ambience, says Clarence Daniels, president of Concessions
Management Services Inc., which operates the bar and eatery. We asked
the artist and models for their perspectives.</LD>

<DH>The Latest From Will Karges, Master of the Celebrity Buzz,
Is a Quieter Scene</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The hip quotient at the new Drake's in Venice is high. First, it's in
Venice, less than a block from the infamous boardwalk. Second, this
contemporary American restaurant is the project of Will Karges, the
plugged-in entrepreneur behind Blueberry, El Dorado and the recently
defunct Rix. Karges is a master at creating the buzz needed to put a
restaurant on the map, if only briefly. I used to think he bused in
babes to populate the upstairs bar at Rix, until I saw seven or eight
step from a white stretch limo and upgraded the mode of
transportation.</LD>
<LD>   Set in the historic St. Mark's building, Drake's has the feel of a
speak-easy. Most of the light in the dark space comes from the open
kitchen at the back of the room. On the long side of the L-shaped
dining room are cozy booths and white-clothed tables. Beyond that are
two rows of banquettes with an upturned gondola mounted overhead. A
tall mirrored art piece includes a still of Dennis Hopper from the
film "Easy Rider," like an artifact from another era.</LD>
<TE>   Despite Karges' connections, in the four or more times I've
stopped in in as many months, Drake's still looks like a scene
waiting to happen. Either Karges has lost his touch or, what I hope
is true, he's aiming for a quieter, more mature atmosphere.
Admittedly, Drake's is a late-night venue. Things don't begin to pick
up until well after 9 on the weekends. But even on a weekday night
when we reserve at 8, the staff dishes out plenty of attitude. My
friend Deanne arrives out of sorts. "With the velvet rope out front
you'd think Aerosmith was playing inside! There's nobody waiting! All
I wanted to do was join the table, but the manager stopped me. I had
to wait for the hostess!"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the food is smart, straight-ahead American comfort
food. Chef Christian Shaffer has put in time at Cicada, Pinot Bistro
and the Napa Valley's Pinot Blanc. The Los Angeles native has written
a menu at Drake's that should appeal to both beach bums and high
society.</TE>
<TE>   For die-hard pizza fans, Shaffer offers "thin-crusters." The one
topped with grilled tiger shrimp with caramelized onions and sliced
Bliss potatoes is delicious. "The Red and Bleu's"
flavors--gorgonzola, halved red grapes and prosciutto--sound bizarre
but they make magic together. An equally zany idea falls flat:
roasted chicken and creamed corn pizza. As soon as you take a bite,
the chicken and corn fall off the pale crust. Shaffer scores a direct
hit with his steak tartare. Sitting atop a bright red steak patty is
half a quail's egg. The idea is to spill the yolk into the
hand-chopped beef, and mix in any or all of the seasonings arranged
in discrete piles around the beef--which include grain mustard,
chopped red onion, parsley, capers, and sea salt--to taste. Another
success is sand dabs, one of the few truly local fish you ever get in
L.A. restaurants. Pairing these sweet, tasty flatfish with rock
shrimp is a nice idea, but piling the fried seafood into a paper cone
may not be. The seafood tends to steam, so the crust loses its
crispness. But I love the fiery rouille that comes with it.</TE>
<TE>   Caesar salad gets the full art-directed treatment. A 6-inch
section of bread has been set on end and hollowed out to form a sort
of vase. Hearts of romaine are neatly tucked in, so the whole thing
looks a little like an Indian headdress.</TE>
<TE>   In a town where most chefs are fine with offering any old
vegetable puree as soup, Drake's stand out. One night it's Italian
egg drop soup, or straciatella, made with good chicken broth and
swatches of spinach and egg. Charred tomato soup another night
features a thick-textured puree of smoky tomatoes lit up with cayenne
or chile. It's a little like a Mexican version of the Tuscan pappa al
pomodoro. Twice-baked lobster may have had more life the first time
around.</TE>
<TE>   Main courses are hit and miss. A hefty pork T-bone, juicy and
ribboned with tasty fat, is terrific. But a Delmonico steak suffers
from being cut too thin, and tastes more steamed than charred. Prime
flatiron steak doesn't have enough flavor to persuade anybody to
switch from a New York or a Porterhouse.</TE>
<TE>   In the best steakhouse tradition, Drake's kitchen tries out some
innovative sides. Creamed spinach is more like spinach leaves with
cream poured over the top. And wild mushroom tart is basically a dish
of sauteed mushrooms wearing a puff-pastry hat. Fava beans with ham
hocks sounds inspired: I'm hoping the half-raw favas I had are just
one night's aberration. However, Drake's mashed potatoes, which are
doctored with creme fraiche, shallots and bacon, are divine.</TE>
<TE>   That Venice classic, linguine and clams, is prepared here with
respect. And my friend who ordered prawns with fettuccine was a bit
startled to find several huge Hawaiian prawns sprawled, heads on,
next to a creamy bed of fettuccine dotted with caper berries.
However, after the initial shock, he dug in and the delicious noodles
quickly disappeared. I wish I could say the same for the roasted
black mussels with leeks and saffron. The mussels taste funky. Short
ribs with bone marrow is a dish I normally love, but this particular
version misfires. Instead of separate ribs, it's one big bone, and
extremely fatty.</TE>
<TE>   It is worth the wait for the chocolate souffle, though it's really
more a molten chocolate cake than a true souffle. It is the stuff of
chocoholics' dreams. There's also a dense, warm pecan bread pudding
paired with maple ice cream. A strawberry shortcake with chantilly
cream falls short. More berries, please.</TE>
<TE>   Karges and company have secured a prime Venice beach spot. But for
Drake's to measure up as more than just another short-lived hipster
hangout, the kitchen needs to go with the strengths of the menu,
which are many. All it takes is losing the dishes that are more
gimmicky than soul-satisfying. They might think about taking in that
velvet rope, too.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to imagine this is enough to cause weeping in Mudville, but it
is nevertheless true that every Saturday afternoon, some of L.A.'s
top rock critics--gimlet-eyed tough customers from The Times, L.A.
Weekly, New Times Los Angeles, the Hollywood Reporter and Spin, as
well as veterans of the now-defunct BAM, Los Angeles Reader and Ray
Gun--shelve the pitches from publicists and pitch to each other in a
decidedly less than venomous game of softball.</LD>
<TE>   "It's 'Bull Durham' meets 'High Fidelity,' " jokes freelance art
and entertainment critic David A. Greene, who says he started the
pick-up game in 1995 with Erik Himmelsbach, then his editor at the
Reader. (Himmelsbach insists that he started it. Critics are like
that.) Friends were drafted to play (many of them music journalists)
and the game became a year-round weekly rite staged at parks and high
schools around the city. The high jinks went on hiatus in 1996 after
the Reader folded and Greene moved to New York to freelance for the
Village Voice, the New Yorker and Spin. Things picked up again in
1999 with Greene's return to Los Angeles. "I look forward to it all
week," says Himmelsbach, who now covers music as a producer at VH-1
and a freelance contributor to Blender. "You get to live out your
athletic fantasies." The literate crew prefer to play against each
other rather than challenging other teams in a league and view
themselves as "a little family"--tight-knit, but not without
bickering: Debate over the infield fly rule might segue occasionally
into dissection of, say, the merits of "prog rock" versus heavy
metal.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, the players--these days a diverse crew that includes
TV writers, musicians and an urban planner eager to break into
freelance rock journalism--do some networking. Greene admits to
getting his last couple of writing gigs through teammates. But he and
Himmelsbach maintain that the game is no industry schmooze-fest.
Business card-passing is kept to a minimum and a published byline is
not a prerequisite for participation, though competitive jocks need
not apply. "We're open to any fun-loving, not-so-talented players,"
says Greene. "We pretty much all suck," adds Himmelsbach. "That's the
joy of it. It's a level playing field."</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles, the city that brought you waiters who tell you their
name along with the specials, is once again breaking new ground in
the personal service field. At the ArcLight Cinemas complex at the
Cinerama Dome site at Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street, audiences
are treated to warmup patter from a crew member who steps before the
screen and opens with, "Hello, my name is . . . and I'll be your
usher tonight!"</LD>
<LD>   In addition to their names, ArcLight ushers offer movie factoids
and assure the audience that they are available for questions.
According to chief operating officer Nora Dashwood, usher
conviviality is part of a company commitment to making moviegoing a
personal, luxurious experience--a concept that at the ArcLight means
theaters with distraction-free European-style "black box" screening
rooms, gift shop, cafe with full bar, adult admission prices of $11
to $14 and a "reserved seating" policy in which the theater assigns
seating within a ticket buyer's preferred section.</LD>
<LD>   Not every usher ("audience greeter" at the ArcLight) gets stage
time. This is Hollywood and there is an audition process. The theater
wants the talent--er, staff--to be film buffs who are comfortable
addressing large audiences. Dashwood confirms that the applicant pool
includes a large ratio of actors.</LD>
<TE>   Ushers Jeremy Catalino, 25, and Bernard Legend Busby, 29, aren't
actors, but they are personable, appealing and trying to break into
the industry, Catalino as a screenwriter and Busby as a screenwriter
and cinematographer. Introducing "Road to Perdition" at a summer
matinee, Catalino offers a quick rundown of director Sam Mendes' past
credits, while at another showing Busby informs viewers that the film
was shot "entirely on existing location in Chicago . . . all [Mendes]
had to do was add people and cars."</TE>
<TE>   Like live performers everywhere, ArcLight ushers are occasionally
challenged for material. Busby had trouble coming up with anything to
say about the recent Japanese import "Warm Water Under a Red Bridge"
("it's an obscure foreign film . . . no one had any idea what it was
about") while Catalino says he worried that youthful "Austin Powers
in Goldmember" audiences wouldn't take to the theater's seating
policy.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the danger of being upstaged in a town that's
crawling with scene stealers. At a late afternoon screening of the
comedy "Mr. Deeds," "Friends" star Matthew Perry, an ArcLight
regular, surprised crew member Abner Valencuela, 24, who says he
yielded the stage when Perry got out of his seat and took over the
introduction. After riffing on the movie's poster, Perry advised the
audience to keep an eye on the performance of his friend, John
Turturro, which he called "just hilarious."</TE>

<LD>DETOURS: LIFE, DEATH AND DIVORCE ON THE ROAD TO STURGIS, By Richard
La Plante, Forge, $24.95</LD>
<LD>   The Sturgis in the title is Sturgis, S.D., the largest gathering
of roaming and roaring motorcycles and motorcyclists in America.</LD>
<LD>   The author, La Plante, is a writer-biker in his early 50s,
recently returned from a long spell (and failed first marriage) in
England, his open-road cravings tempered by consideration for his new
(and growing) stateside family, his journey a mostly solo adventure
of 2,400 miles or so.</LD>
<TE>   The result is an offbeat, perplexing book, full of sustained
soul-searching, unpunished speed-limit violations, the occasional
raw, true moment and much loving description of custom bikes.</TE>
<TE>   He is, by his own account, a vain, competitive, athletic guy who
seems bent on understanding himself better, how his first marriage
crumbled, the death of his father, the challenge of making room in a
grown-up life for the plain glee of riding loud and fast.</TE>
<TE>   His happiest moments are "me and the silver bike, joined at the
hip, with time dissolving all around us. Feeling, for the first time,
that I'd found the center of the universe."</TE>
<TE>   And his tenure in England keeps turning up entertainingly in his
vocabulary ("bin liners" for "trash bags," "macadam" for "blacktop,"
"marquee" for "tent"--not exactly cycle gang argot).</TE>
<TE>   La Plante is so interested in the interior journey, however, that
I found myself wishing I'd hitched a ride with a more superficial
biker, one who worked the crowd a little more and gave me a clearer
view of who does what when several thousand bikers gather for several
days, perhaps a few more paragraphs to flesh out passing characters
like:</TE>
<TE>   Sandy, who had, since her husband's death (on a motorcycle) in
April, been on the road, all by herself, rally to rally, camping out
and living rough. She had built houses for a living, and I remember
her handshake to be dry and strong. She was honest, independent and
without self-pity. When I asked her why she was riding, she answered
simply, "to think things through."</TE>
<TE>   More of Sandy, please, and less of the author as he floats among
Sturgis sales ops, trying to peddle copies of "Hog Fever," his first
bike book. Also, while I'm making requests, a more vigilant copy
editor would have noticed that singer Marty Robbins' name is spelled
two ways, both wrong, within nine pages.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHEAP HOTELS, By Daisann McLane, Taschen, $20</TE>
<TE>   Back when I was a full-time travel writer and staying in hotels
for a living, I swear, I daydreamed this book. But my dream book was
not as handsomely designed, and my dream text had fewer details, and
I was never really sure whether a civilian would be at all
interested.</TE>
<TE>   But McLane, who has written the Frugal Traveler column for the New
York Times these last four years, and her editors have done well
here. In essence, they've converted a file cabinet full of snapshots
and several frayed notebooks into a charming, quirky volume fortified
with practical information. (Another thing my daydreamed book didn't
include: English text in blue ink, alongside German text in red and
French in black. Tres global.)</TE>
<TE>   You can cluck over the snapshots of dire bedspreads (Park Brompton
Inn, Chicago) and delightful views (Aroko Bungalows, Rarotonga, the
Cook Islands) and pore over the prices McLane paid at scores of
hostelries worldwide (from $4 nightly in Madras, India, to $185 at
California's White Sulphur Springs Resort and Spa), or read the
essays, which muse on the lodging life.</TE>
<TE>   Writes McLane: "Hotel rooms, even the most pleasant ones, contain
within their walls a hint of melancholy.... Each night, the room's
allure fades ever so slightly, as you discover and explore the even
more intriguing world outside its limits. And then, finally, you say
goodbye, pack up and leave it to someone else."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ARIZONA, MAUI, HAWAII, THE BIG ISLAND, Various authors, Lonely
Planet, $14.99-$16.99 each</TE>
<TE>   Three decades ago they began with a thin guide to traveling on a
shoestring in Asia. Now the empire that Lonely Planet founders Tony
and Maureen Wheeler have built covers more territory than those
British colonists of centuries past ever did. Our good fortune is
that, in recent years, the thirst for expansion has driven the
Australia-based LP people to look beyond their original targets--the
difficult countries that other guidebook publishers didn't much
bother with--and give us plain old California tourist favorites as
well.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years the company has hit Las Vegas and San Diego.
And this year, for the first time, Lonely Planet offers an entire
guidebook on Arizona, another on Maui and another on Hawaii's Big
Island. In coming months a Pacific Mexico volume will follow. (LP has
covered Hawaii and Mexico before but never with this narrowed focus.)</TE>
<TE>   To certain travel snobs, this may look like a retreat from
backpack traveler ideals.</TE>
<TE>   To those of us who seldom get more than a week away, these books
are a welcome addition to the literature. They bear many of the usual
LP hallmarks: The Big Island guide, for instance, features frank
explanations of the Hawaii sovereignty movement and the fall of
tourism revenues after Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   However, perhaps inevitably, the series' old penchant for
penny-pinching (and downright scorn for luxury) has evolved to allow
for more discussion of the upscale options, such as the grand hotels
outside Phoenix or in Maui's highly manicured Wailea resort area.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the first Club Med opened in the Western Hemisphere, the entire
staff was French. Later, the organization took on an occasional
Venezuelan, then gradually switched to an all-nations policy. Today
Club Med actively seeks U.S. and Canadian personnel.</LD>
<LD>   From a recruitment office in Coral Gables, Fla., and through
"auditions" in several U.S. and Canadian cities, Club Med hires staff
throughout the year to keep things lively at more than a dozen Club
Med vacation villages in the Caribbean and Mexico. Positions include
lodging personnel, food service experts and recreation specialists,
as well as gentils organisateurs (or "G.O.s," meaning "nice
organizers," similar to camp counselors).</LD>
<LD>   You're hired for six months and receive air fare, room, board and
a salary that averages $450 a month for most short-term employees.</LD>
<TE>   You must be at least 19, "outgoing, friendly and personable," and
have experience--if you're applying simply for a G.O. position--in
"customer contacts" or some other such social activity. You apply at
www.clubmedjobs.com. Lists describe openings in child care and
health, arts and crafts, sports, performing arts, food and beverage,
housekeeping and maintenance, massage, stage management, guest
services and retail sales. Or you can contact the Club Med
recruitment office, 75 Valencia Ave., 12th Floor, Coral Gables, FL
33134; fax (305) 476-4100.</TE>
<TE>   Some villages need summer child-care help for short periods, but
these jobs are for room and board only, no salary, and sometimes
involve seven-day-a-week schedules. It's explained on the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Auditions are scheduled nearly every day, September through
November, throughout the U.S. and Canada. Los Angeles/Marina del Rey
auditions will be Oct. 3 and 4 and Nov. 14 and 15.</TE>
<TE>   If there's no audition near you, apply online and you'll be
contacted when an event is scheduled in a nearby city. Or review the
events calendar at www.clubmedjobs.com for audition sites.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The best bargain packages to Europe usually start Nov. 1, and this
year is no exception. The trade-off, of course, is chillier weather.
One of the lower-priced deals is from Los Angeles-based France
Vacations. For prices starting at $579 per person, double occupancy,
you get round-trip nonstop air fare between LAX and Paris, five
nights' hotel in Paris, daily breakfast and a one-hour cruise on the
Seine. Taxes, except for airport departures taxes of about $79 per
person, are included. You fly on Air Tahiti Nui, Tahiti's national
airline, which departs LAX on Wednesdays. The deal is good for
departures Nov. 1 to Dec. 14 and Dec. 24 to March 31, subject to
availability. Hotel upgrades are available at extra cost. (800)
332-5332, www.francevacations.net. (Click on "USA-PARIS" under
"Winter &amp; Spring Specials" and choose Los Angeles as the departure
point and Air Tahiti Nui as the airline.)</LD>

<HD>New Boston Library Honors Founder of Christian Science</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A $50-million museum and library inspired by the ideas of Mary Baker
Eddy is to open Saturday in Boston, home of the Church of Christ,
Scientist, which she established. Eddy (1821-1910), a religious
leader, author and teacher who founded the church in 1879 and the
Christian Science Monitor in 1908, espoused the philosophy that all
healing comes through the power of God.</LD>
<LD>   The Mary Baker Eddy Library for the Betterment of Humanity will
include the Mapparium, a 30-foot-diameter, stained-glass globe built
in 1935, which visitors enter on a footbridge. The globe, formerly in
the Christian Science Monitor newspaper building, has been
retrofitted with more than 200 LED fixtures and an audio tour.</LD>
<LD>   The eight-minute audio focuses on "the power of ideas to change
the world," a tenet of Eddy's philosophy, said Stephen Danzansky,
chief executive of the private, nonprofit organization that runs the
library.</LD>
<TE>   Other areas of the library overlook the Christian Science Monitor
newsroom, have exhibits on newspaper production and focus on
"people's quest for meaning in life," officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The library will also make available, for the first time,
thousands of documents, artifacts and photos from Eddy's life. These
had been stored in vaults in the First Church of Christ, Scientist,
in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Admission is $5 adults, $3 children 6 to 12, free for under age 6.
Most sections are open daily; hours will vary. (888) 222-3721,

<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ritz-Carlton this weekend opened a hotel in Coconut Grove, its second
in the Miami area and its seventh in Florida, which has more
Ritz-Carltons than any other state. (California is second with five.)</LD>
<LD>   By next summer the luxury chain plans to open two more Florida
hotels, in Miami's South Beach and in Orlando.</LD>
<LD>   The Coconut Grove opening is part of a drive to promote Miami as
an international gateway, especially for South Americans, who make up
nearly 20% of guests at the Ritz-Carlton, Key Biscayne, said Manny
Corral, the chain's Miami-area director of marketing.</LD>
<TE>   The new hotel, which overlooks Biscayne Bay, has 115 rooms,
restaurant, lounge, fitness center and spa, outdoor pool and services
such as a "Bow Wow Butler" for hire who will walk your dog and feed
it "poochie sushi." Introductory room rates start at $139 a night
through Sept. 30 and $169 Oct. 1 to Dec. 24, subject to availability.
Regular rates start at $230 and vary by season. (800) 241-3333,

especially cautious at restaurants, churches and other places
frequented by their compatriots. For updates, call (888) 407-4747 or

which closed all 453 guest rooms at its year-old Kalia Tower this

<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSEMARY McCLURE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WILLIAMS, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The train was rumbling across a lonely plain dotted with rabbit brush
when we noticed them. Three men, standing close to the tracks,
staring up at us as we roared by. About 10 minutes later we saw more.
A group of four this time, staring and pointing. They jumped into a
battered black Jeep as we passed, and a small dust cloud rose as the
driver hit the gas.</LD>
<LD>   A railroad employee was in the aisle next to me, and I turned and
looked at her quizzically. "They're trying to get ahead of us so they
can watch the train go by again," she said.</LD>
<LD>   "Why would they do that?" I asked.</LD>
<TE>   "They're foamers," she said, laughing. "Every time they see a
train, they foam at the mouth."</TE>
<TE>   To a train fanatic, we must have seemed like nirvana on wheels.</TE>
<TE>   We were aboard the Grand Canyon Railway, a restored 100-year-old
line that provides service to the South Rim of Grand Canyon National
Park. Our Wild West-style Pullman cars were being pulled by a 1920s
locomotive, steam belching from its stack. We could hear the wail of
the whistle and feel the vibration of the rails as we negotiated the
65 miles of Arizona high country between Williams and the South Rim.</TE>
<TE>   We saw train fans all along the route. We had unintentionally
booked our trip during the mid-August convention of the National
Railroad Historical Society, so train lovers were everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   We enjoyed the train too, but when we arrived at the rim, we
turned our attention to the mile-deep canyon that's considered one of
the natural wonders of the world. The four of us--my co-worker Gail
Fisher, her 12-year-old son, Zack, and his friend Kyle--were taking
advantage of a $602 railway package that included two nights'
accommodation, two meals, a canyon tour and the round-trip train
ride. (The cost for four will decrease to $435 during the low season,
Oct. 15 to March 15.) Besides being inexpensive, the trip was easy to
arrange. One phone call took care of booking the train, one night at
the Maswik Lodge at the South Rim and another night at the
railway-owned Fray Marcos Hotel in Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The train offered a fun way to introduce children to the
canyon--and to do our part to keep vehicles out of the park. On a
peak summer day, as many as 6,000 drivers try to wedge their cars
into 2,400 parking places. Consequently, drivers may do more circling
than parking. Visitors don't really need cars. The train stops steps
away from the rim; free buses go almost anywhere else you might wish
to go.</TE>
<TE>   Our biggest mistake was bad timing: We left the Los Angeles area
at 7:30 p.m. on a Friday--just in time to wallow in heavy
get-out-of-town-for-the-weekend traffic. We spent more than eight
hours driving to Williams. The return trip Monday took only six
hours, and that included a bit of shopping at the outlet mall near
Barstow.</TE>
<TE>   The Grand Canyon train runs daily, steaming out of the depot in
Williams at 10 a.m. while railway employees--as many as 30
strong--stand on the platform waving goodbye. Incredibly hokey, but
seemingly no one aboard complains.</TE>
<TE>   There are five classes of service, including coach, where we rode,
and an upper-level observation dome. The dome offers a fun ride; it's
air-conditioned and has a 180-degree view of the passing countryside.
But the price difference is substantial, especially considering that
the ride is only about 2 1/4 hours. If we had not purchased our coach
seats as part of a package, they would have cost $54.94 for each
adult and $24.94 for each child, round trip. Seats in the dome
section cost $129.94 for an adult and $99.94 for a child.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of class, passengers receive beverages, are serenaded
by strolling musicians and meet the Cataract Creek Gang, a smiling
band of Old West characters. A club car sells alcoholic beverages,
and passengers can buy snacks in a cafe car. The diversions are
worthwhile, especially for kids, because riders are mostly paying for
the novelty of the experience, not breathtaking scenery whizzing by.</TE>
<TE>   The train arrives at the rim's historic log depot shortly after
noon. Day-trippers have about three hours to glance at the canyon,
visit a couple of shops and gulp down a quick lunch before the "All
aboard" sounds for the return trip to Williams. Too much to see, too
much to do. We were glad we had an extra day.</TE>
<TE>   The Grand Canyon, 277 miles long and up to 18 miles wide at
points, draws as many as 5 million visitors a year. Most of them see
it from the 7,000-foot-high South Rim, which is open year-round. They
gaze down at its colorful walls, straining to see the Colorado River
below. Some will try to make the 22-mile, three-day hike up and down
steep trails to the North Rim. Others will drive 215 miles to the
less developed north side. But most will be content to stand on the
rim and watch the shifting shadows on its buttes and towers.</TE>
<TE>   A five-minute walk from the rim we found our lodge, the Maswik,
named after a Hopi Indian spirit. The Maswik is described in
brochures as offering "modern rooms for the budget traveler." It is
one of seven lodges at the South Rim, all managed by Xanterra Parks &amp;
Resorts. The standout is El Tovar, a National Historic Landmark built
in 1905 to resemble the grand hunting lodges of Europe. Zack and Kyle
described it aptly as "very Titanic-y." It is a wonderful place, full
of charm and genteel hospitality. Unfortunately, it is so popular
that rooms must be booked months in advance during the peak
April-to-October season, unless you hope for a cancellation.</TE>
<TE>   The Maswik doesn't have El Tovar's dizzying canyon view or its
gentility or its architectural significance, but it was clean and had
comfortable beds, hot water and ESPN, which made the boys happy. We
could also have lunch at its cafeteria, which serves salads,
sandwiches and Sonoran-style Mexican food. We concentrated on the
tacos and veggie burritos, which came with a piquant sauce, rice and
black beans. Tasty, but so heavy we felt like napping. That would
never do because it was time for another feature of our
rails-to-the-rim package: a 3 1/2- hour bus tour.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky for us, guide Rich Ederer knew how to keep sleepy tourists
from drifting off. He kept up a steady chatter of jokes, factoids and
historical tidbits as we rolled along Desert View Drive. He told us
that the Colorado River, which carved the canyon, drains water from
seven states. The resulting geological museum exposes 2 billion years
of Earth's history. He also told us about the average of 12 deaths a
year at the canyon, some of them falls, some hikers who failed to
pack enough water.</TE>
<TE>   That night we visited another lodge at the South Rim, Bright
Angel, which opened in 1935. It is also a National Historic Landmark
but lacks the polish and sophistication of El Tovar. We found the
staff unfriendly and the dining room disappointing. Our server
dropped off our roast turkey, spinach salad and hamburgers with a
comment that he wouldn't be back because he was "going out for a
smoke. And be sure to get a load of that skunk out in front when you
leave." We weren't quite sure how to take that.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Grand Canyon's grandest sights is sunrise. So we
lurched out of bed before 5 the next morning and took a shuttle to
Hopi Point. At first we saw only stars and an almost-full moon
hanging low on the horizon. But before long, the sun began to tint
the sky, and when it crested above the canyon, there seemed to be
almost an electric shock as its full rays struck the spires and walls
below us. The light show lasted more than an hour, bathing everything
in the warm golden hues.</TE>
<TE>   We capped off our visit to Hopi Point with an easy hike along the
rim, then wandered down to El Tovar for lunch. The room has large
picture windows overlooking the canyon, open-beam ceilings and huge
mission-style chandeliers. We tried a Mediterranean salad with
grilled chicken ($11.50), a barbecue beef sandwich with mounds of
juicy meat ($9.20) and blackened Idaho rainbow trout served with a
tangy citrus tomato salsa ($14.25). Each item was a hit.</TE>
<TE>   When we finished, the "All aboard" was echoing from the depot, and
we walked back to the train. Within a few hours we were in Williams.
We still had a few vouchers left in our tour package: a dinner and a
breakfast at Max &amp; Thelma's Restaurant and an overnight stay at the
Fray Marcos Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The train depot, restaurant and hotel are in a circular compound
in downtown Williams; all are owned by Max and Thelma Biegert, who
resurrected the Grand Canyon Railway in 1989. The hotel, which opened
in 1995, looks like a transplanted Kentucky turnpike motel--a long,
rectangular box with neoclassical columns in front. A life-size
cast-bronze statue of a horse stands near the entry.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the lobby has a 35-foot ceiling and a huge fireplace. But
rooms are typical motel style. The bathrooms are large, but the
carpets and walls are stained. We were equally unimpressed with our
two meals. The vouchers were for buffets. If you're hungry--and like
starches--you'll be satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   Before we left for home I asked a desk clerk about the horse. Why
was it there?</TE>
<TE>   She laughed. "Can't you guess? Williams is a one-horse town."</TE>

<LD>Long-distance and airline travel aren't hard just on your feet, back
and neck. The eyes can suffer too, especially if you're bound for
high altitudes or sunny climates, wear contact lenses, have
conditions such as dry eye or have had recent vision surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Eye discomfort can begin soon after takeoff. Dry airplane cabins
speed the evaporation of natural tears, says Jeffrey Weaver, an
optometrist at the American Optometric Assn., and can make your eyes
feel dry, gritty and scratchy. This can be especially nettlesome for
contact lens wearers, he says.</LD>
<LD>   To counteract the dryness, increase the production of natural
tears by blinking more, Weaver suggests. If that's not enough, use
artificial tears, available over the counter. Contact lens wearers
should take along rewetting drops, designed to be used while the
lenses are in place.</LD>
<TE>   If you wear contacts and your eyes become irritated during a
flight, remove the lenses if possible, Weaver says, washing your
hands first. Remove the lenses for the entire flight if possible,
says Jay Schlanger, a Los Angeles optometrist who is a clinical
instructor for UC Berkeley, the Montreal School of Optometry and the
Pennsylvania College of Optometry, Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Determining whether reddened eyes are infected or just irritated
can be tricky. "If there is redness, the thing you worry about the
most is mucus or discharge," Schlanger says. "That almost always
means infection."</TE>
<TE>   If you suspect an eye infection, seek medical help. This is
especially critical for contact lens wearers, says Dr. David A. Boes,
an ophthalmologist in Great Falls, Mont., who has studied vision
problems in travelers. "Contact lens wearers are at risk for corneal
infections, which can lead to ulcers and permanent vision loss," he
says. Prompt treatment of eye infections can also ease the pain that
often accompanies them.</TE>
<TE>   If eye irritation and redness are the result of late nights, go
easy on those "get-the-red-out" drops that work by constricting the
blood vessels. "Using an eye whitener really masks any potential
problems," Weaver says. The vessels dilate to begin with, he adds, in
response to some irritation such as dirt particles or wind. Better to
pinpoint and get rid of the irritation. If you must use eye
whiteners, Weaver recommends only short-term use. If irritation
persists more than a day, you need to find the cause.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers who have undergone Lasik surgery within six months of
their trip should be especially cautious about eye care, Boes says.</TE>
<TE>   Dry eyes, for instance, can be a problem, at least temporarily,
for some Lasik patients. He tells travelers who have had Lasik to
take along artificial tears--"the kind that are unpreserved," he
adds, because those with preservatives can irritate the eye.</TE>
<TE>   Climbing to very high altitudes soon after Lasik surgery may cause
some temporary deterioration of vision, he adds. Visiting altitudes
of 8,000 feet or so for snow sports probably won't cause a problem.
But there can be a change for the worse at 18,000 feet or more. Boes
cites the case of two physician climbers, both recent Lasik patients,
who had this problem during their ascent of 22,834-foot Mt. Aconcagua
in the Andes. One doctor estimated that his vision declined to 20/100
in one eye (20/20 is ideal) and 20/125 in the other, Boes reported
recently in the Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery. The
other's vision declined to 20/160 and 20/30. Both reported the loss
as temporary; their vision returned to 20/20 after descent.</TE>
<TE>   Other cases of vision deterioration in patients who have undergone
refractive surgery have been reported, but it is not known how
widespread the problem is. "There are many climbers who have had
Lasik who have gone to very high altitudes and not had vision
problems," Boes says. "But the more you baby those eyes in the first
six months [after surgery], the better."</TE>
<TE>   To be safe, he suggests waiting at least that long after the
surgery to ascend to 18,000 feet or higher.</TE>
<TE>   All travelers should minimize ultraviolet exposure by wearing
polarized sunglasses, especially in certain locales: "Lower latitudes
and higher altitudes have higher ultraviolet levels," Weaver says.</TE>
<TE>   Choose sunglasses that block 99% to 100% of UV light, eye care
experts suggest. Ultraviolet rays are associated with increased
cataract risk and perhaps with the development of retinal disease.
Too much UV light can also cause corneal inflammation and burns.</TE>
<TE>   Frequent travelers who wear contact lenses might ask to be fitted
with low-water-content lenses, Schlanger says. Low-water lenses are
made of a stiffer material that doesn't require as much water as
other lenses to stay wet and comfortable. Some lenses with a higher
water content, he says, need the eye to produce a lot of tears. But
in a dry environment, the tears evaporate quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Assembling a travel eye-care kit can preserve eye health and
comfort. Experts suggest taking backup eyeglasses and a copy of your
prescription as well as contact lens supplies, artificial tears and
any medications normally taken.</TE>

<HD>Eastern Canada's Shoreline Trail Showcases Local Color
Perfectly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It may be too soon to rank Cape Chignecto with some of the world's
great coastal walking areas, such as the Na Pali Coast of Kauai, the
Cornwall coast in England or the Lost Coast Trail in Northern
California. But this Nova Scotia park with newly expanded footpaths
has received rave reviews from the few (mostly Canadian) hikers who
have discovered it.</LD>
<LD>   I'm going out on a red-spruce limb to make a prediction: Once the
good word gets out to European and American hikers, Cape Chignecto
will become an international attraction, because hikers here find one
of eastern Canada's most compelling lengths of shoreline.</LD>
<LD>   Cape Chignecto beckons hikers with stands of red spruce and yellow
birch. The trees stand at the edge of 600-foot cliffs looking down at
tides that rise as much as 70 feet--the world's highest--in the Bay
of Fundy. Peregrine falcons swoop overhead, and moose and
white-tailed deer browse the lush vegetation of the bluff tops.</LD>
<TE>   Cape Chignecto Provincial Park first welcomed hikers on this land
in 1998. Open May through October, the park is a terrific place for
leaf peepers looking for autumn color without the crowds. The
headlands put on a magnificent show, usually from the last week in
September through mid-October, when three varieties of maple and
other hardwoods don their fall finery.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-mile Cape Chignecto Coastal Trail is ideal for backpacking
expeditions of at least three days.</TE>
<TE>   Half a dozen hike-in camps with enticing names such as Stoney
Beach, Big Bald Rock Brook and Seal Cove are half a day's walk apart
along the trail. Reservations and a fee of about $11.50 per site per
night are required.</TE>
<TE>   The park also rents two cabins on the southern part of the trail.
The cabins provide a roof over your head and eliminate the need for a
tent, but they lack any other accouterments, so you still have to
pack in everything else.</TE>
<TE>   On the cape's south side, the trail runs through three steep, deep
canyons. On the north side, along fractured bluffs, hikers are
treated to views across the bay to Fundy National Park in the
province of New Brunswick.</TE>
<TE>   The hike starts at the Red Rocks Visitor Center and travels 30
miles to the dramatic rock formations known as Three Sisters. From
here you have two choices for getting back to Red Rocks: Arrange to
be picked up on rough Eatonville Road, which extends along the park's
eastern boundary; or spend a long day hiking about 15 miles on the
new inland extension of the trail, which returns to the visitor
center.</TE>
<TE>   In a world where everything seems machine made, Cape Chignecto is
a triumphant exception.</TE>
<TE>   "Our coastal trail is completely handmade," chief park attendant
Mike Collins said as we hiked toward Refugee Cove. Collins, trail
foreman during the path's construction in 1996 and '97, said builders
knew maintenance would be difficult because of the remote location.</TE>
<TE>   Trail connoisseurs will appreciate the quality of construction.
It's not one of those ghastly, wide multiuse modern constructs.
Instead it's a narrow, carefully crafted path designed for foot
traffic only--a trail that goes easy on the land.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to maximize the wilderness experience for the hiker and
keep the trail as close to the edge of the coastal bluffs as
possible, but at the same time make it as safe as a remote trail can
be," Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   For day hikers, Cape Chignecto has a range of walks for varying
interests and abilities.</TE>
<TE>   The visitor center has interpretive exhibits, maps and a
knowledgeable staff.</TE>
<TE>   The best family walk is Fundy Ridge Trail, a three-hour jaunt that
climbs bluffs to an old-growth forest and offers great views. The
path switchbacks down to the shore and travels on the beach on the
way back to the trail head.</TE>
<TE>   For a more challenging hike, follow the Coastal Trail from the
visitor center to Mill Brook Canyon Trail Camp. The route is about 10
miles round trip.</TE>
<TE>   Don't make the same mistake I did driving to the park. I assumed
Fundy Shore Scenic Drive would hug Nova Scotia's north shore and
deliver views of the Bay of Fundy. It does neither.</TE>
<TE>   The best route is westbound Highways 2 and 209. From Truro (60
miles north of Halifax), drive about 80 miles west to the hamlet of
Advocate Harbour and the Cape Chignecto park.</TE>

<HD>Hotel Beds Really Can Be the Stuff of Dreams</HD>
<DH>Guests reap the benefits of corporate pillow fights as the
chains plump up their ratings with luxury linens and 'heavenly'
mattresses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're hoping for a luxurious bed in a budget hotel, dream on. But
even midpriced places can have bad beds, and you probably won't sleep
any better in a pricey hotel's $1,500-a-night room than in its $450
standard room.</LD>
<LD>   These are tips I've garnered from hoteliers, pollsters and folks
who make mattresses and box springs. While trying to find out who's
good in bed, hotelwise, I've learned about 700-thread-count sheets,
pillow menus and more.</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, the pricier the hotel, the better the bed, in
general. At least guests think so. Asked to rate their bed's comfort
on a 1-to-10 scale, with 10 highest, guests in luxury hotels gave an
average of 8.5 compared with 6.7 in economy or budget hotels, J.D.
Power and Associates reported last month. Market Metrix, a market
research company in San Rafael, Calif., asked 30,000 customers to
rate hotel beds on a 100-point scale. Luxury hotels averaged 89,
economy hotels 78 and midpriced hotels in between.</LD>
<TE>   But beds are not all about dollars and cents. Of 87 chains in the
Market Metrix survey, the luxury W Hotels and Ritz-Carlton ranked
first and second, scoring 98 and 91, respectively. Westin, in the
second-tier "upscale" category, was a close third at 90,
outperforming its class. Among the five lowest-rated chains for beds
were midpriced Ramada and Howard Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "Bedding hasn't been a source of complaints for us," says Emanuel
Naim, a spokesman for Cendant Corp.'s hotel group, which runs the
Ramada and Howard Johnson brands. He declined to comment specifically
on the survey because he hadn't seen it.</TE>
<TE>   As for the W chain, "I've never slept in a more comfortable bed
... so I bought one from the hotel," said one W Chicago City Center
guest who responded to the survey.</TE>
<TE>   Another respondent said that Westin's " 'Heavenly Beds'--luxurious
mattress, down comforter, down pillows--are the reason we stay at
Westin."</TE>
<TE>   W and Westin use different models of custom-made Simmons
mattresses and box springs that you can buy by contacting the hotels.
Interestingly, top-rated W's queen set, priced at $700 for sale to
customers, costs less than either Westin's ($1,100) or Ritz-Carlton's
($1,149, custom-made by Sealy). But W really puts out for the
duvet/comforter, at $280 for a queen, more than Ritz-Carlton or
Westin.</TE>
<TE>   The ritziest linens of these three belong, appropriately enough,
to the Ritz-Carlton: $445 to $660, depending on the pattern, for a
295-to 300-thread-count Egyptian cotton queen set (top and fitted
sheets and two pillowcases). W's queen set costs just $106.</TE>
<TE>   In fact it's on top of the bed, in duvets and sheets, where
marketers of luxury lodgings really stage their pillow fights.</TE>
<TE>   Westin's Heavenly Bed, introduced three years ago, is a
multilayered wedding cake of pillow-top mattress set, down blanket,
three sheets, comforter, duvet and five pillows--all in white. This
bed pioneered several trends in upscale chains: duvets, plenty of
pillows and an obsession with cleanliness. Midpriced chains are
starting to copy it. Next year Sheraton plans to introduce "Sweet
Sleeper" beds, patterned after Westin's and W's, starting at the
Sheraton Studio City in Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Cleanliness is the No. 1 concern of room guests in a J.D. Power
survey and a Hilton poll of its customers last year.</TE>
<TE>   Hoteliers can launder the duvet cover every day, as some claim to
do, or at least after every checkout. By contrast, bulky,
dark-colored bedspreads that some budget hotels use show dirt less
and are more difficult to launder, so they get cleaned less often,
insiders say. (At Motel 6, Red Roof and Studio 6 lodgings, bedspreads
must be clean, without stains, hairs or holes, but there is no
specific schedule for cleaning them, says David O'Shaughnessy, group
executive vice president in Dallas for Accor North America, the
budget chains' owner. He wrote the standards for the hotels. Sheets
must be laundered daily, he adds.)</TE>
<TE>   Customers who are "more prone to having luxurious linens in their
homes" demand the multiple duvets, comforters and pillows, says
Ritz-Carlton spokeswoman Shelby Taylor. Women, who tend to spend more
time in their guest rooms, particularly want luxury, says Leo Vogel,
national sales manager, contract division, for Sealy.</TE>
<TE>   Competition focuses on the top of the bed because, except for the
extremes of low-end and high-end lodgings, what's underneath may not
be radically different among hotels, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Most hotels order beds with sturdier springs and ticking than the
average bed at home just for their durability, Vogel says.
O'Shaughnessy, who oversees about 150,000 beds in 1,200 hotels, says
Accor requires each bed submitted for bids to be tested with a
240-pound weight rolled over it 10,000 times, simulating five to
seven years of wear. Within the same hotel, different-priced rooms
usually get the same mattresses and box springs, but top-level
presidential or bridal suites that cost thousands of dollars a night
may get higher grades, Vogel says.</TE>
<TE>   Many big chains custom-order beds to their specifications, so the
exact model may not be available in retail stores, although some
hotels sell them.</TE>
<TE>   For the well-heeled, there are some cutting-edge choices. Among
them:</TE>
<TE>   * Villa Toscana: This new eight-room inn at a Paso Robles, Calif.,
vineyard estate, which charges $320 to $1,600 per night, uses
700-thread-count, custom-made Italian sheets. Patricia Koberl, the
inn's director of hospitality operations, recalls that one customer
didn't believe it "when I said we have 700-count sheets."</TE>
<TE>   "She thought I said, 'We have 700 sheep,' " Koberl says, adding
that the sheets are "very soft" but high maintenance, requiring hand
pressing after their daily laundering. "We're bed connoisseurs," she
says of herself and the inn owners.</TE>
<TE>   * Post Ranch Inn: At this plush Big Sur resort, guests are
swaddled in organically grown cotton and sleep on wool or cotton
mattresses made by Restonic or Royal-Pedic. You can buy queen sets
for $1,350 to $3,075, depending on model, and sheets ($105 to $120
for queen; other sizes available) from Post Ranch Mercantile, (831)
667-2795, www.postranchmercantile.com.</TE>
<TE>   * The Benjamin in New York and the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia:
These are among hotels offering a variety of by-request pillows
(stuffed with items as diverse as wheat chaff and magnets) or even
full-body cushions.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, hotels continue to search for the perfect bed. Hilton
Hawaiian Village in Honolulu is testing a version that uses air
baffles and wooden slats instead of springs, says Dennis Koci, senior
vice president of operations support for Beverly Hills-based Hilton.
Adjusting to body contours and weight, the bed is said to be good for
your back and varicose veins.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an idea way ahead of its time," Koci says.</TE>
<TE>   And something to sleep on.</TE>

<KH>WYOMING</KH>
<HD>Fall in Cowboy Country</HD>
<DH>In the Grand Tetons, it's a season of crisp days, brilliant
leaves and dwindling visitors. But watch out for those moose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>JACKSON HOLE, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>It was an autumn day in Grand Teton National Park. The sky was an
immaculate blue, the mountains towered stark ahead, and the aspens
and cottonwoods gleamed with umbers and saffrons, shedding a mosaic
of leaves on the trail.</LD>
<LD>   My husband, Greg, and I were hiking above Jenny Lake when we
encountered a trail marked Moose Pond. We took it, aware that a moose
sighting was improbable, but we were hopeful anyway. Lagging, I
rounded a corner and found Greg standing motionless on the trail.</LD>
<LD>   "Look below," he hissed. "There's actually a moose in the pond."</LD>
<TE>   Camera ready, we stalked the moose, commando-style, eventually
abandoning all caution and approaching fully upright. The 900-pound
cow was placidly pulling leaves from the water. We walked so close we
could have tugged her dewlap, the flap of skin under a moose's jaw.
She moved out of the pond, threw us a world-weary look and ambled
off.</TE>
<TE>   The next day we joined a float trip on the Snake River. Ours was
the only boat on the water on this, another perfect day. John, our
float guide, was an orthodox outdoorsman, undoubtedly capable of
fashioning a Quonset hut from bark or apparel from skins.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly someone spotted a moose in the distance, and our fellow
floaters dived for binoculars, agog at the sighting.</TE>
<TE>   "So," asked a jaunty woman from Kansas, "are moose dangerous?"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yessiree, ma'am," John said. "They'll stomp on you till you
ain't movin'. I know a couple of people who have been killed by
moose. One of my friends got his kidney stomped so bad he was in the
hospital for months. No, ma'am, you don't want to be gettin' close to
no moose."</TE>
<TE>   I stared at Greg. He stared at John. We said nothing.</TE>
<TE>   In New Zealand, my homeland, we don't have large, man-killing
creatures, hence my ignorance of the danger of moose stomping. Greg,
however, is an American and an Eagle Scout. He has a box of patches
that suggest he should know these things. He ignored me, much as our
benevolent moose did. We gazed at the magnificent scenery in silence,
thankful merely to have all organs intact.</TE>
<TE>   We were in Jackson last September to attend a wedding, and our
trip became a weeklong vacation. The only risk in visiting at this
time of year is the weather, which can turn cold. It was 75 degrees
most days of our stay, but in September the average daytime high is
69, falling to 54 in October. I never once wore the heavy coat I had
packed.</TE>
<TE>   Fall is also elk bugling season in Wyoming, which means one must
avoid the gangs of bull elk rampaging through the countryside seeking
mates. We added elk to the list of animals to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Grand Teton is one of America's most beautiful national parks. It
borders Yellowstone, which means the wildlife ranges freely between
the two.</TE>
<TE>   But Grand Teton encompasses only 300,000 acres compared with
Yellowstone's 2.2 million, so it feels intimate and accessible,
dominated by those savagely beautiful mountains. In the summer, Grand
Teton gets 2 million visitors, but in fall that number tapers off to
400,000. It's not hard to imagine the difference in ambience.</TE>
<TE>   We stayed first in Teton Village, then at a dude ranch. Teton
Village, better known as Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, has some of
the best vertical skiing in America, but in summer and fall it
transforms into a destination for outdoorsy die-hards and
extreme-sport aficionados.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving at the village, we noticed a crowd outside the Walk
Festival Hall. Jackson is home to the Teton Gravity Research
Institute, a group of professional adrenaline junkies whose pants
hang below their underwear and who are paid to do highly imprudent
things on snow, big waves or mountain bikes.</TE>
<TE>   These anti-gravity test dummies make movies of their global
exploits, and their ski and snowboard film "Mind the Addiction" was
showing that night. We went. It was terrifying and terrific, with
scenes of skiers hurtling through narrow chutes and snowboarders
free-falling off crevasses.</TE>
<TE>   We stayed in Teton Village because of its location: It's between
the park and the town of Jackson. Our condo was in the Moose Creek
complex at the blissfully quiet end of the village, about half a mile
from the hub of five-star hotels and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Decorated in tasteful Western style, it was spacious and had a
stone fireplace, hot tub, great views and a large deck. In winter,
Moose Creek has ski-in/ski-out access with a chairlift connecting
guests to the resort.</TE>
<TE>   Our first morning in Teton Village we ate brunch at the Mangy
Moose, a classically eccentric Western bar and restaurant in the
village. We sat outside, gazing at the ski hill. In dry months you
can hike all over the mountain, some of which stretches into the
park.</TE>
<TE>   Post-omelet, we took the tram to the summit and hiked the Rock
Springs loop back down to the village. From the top we could see the
craggy Grand Teton peak, the tallest of the spires at 13,770 feet.
Grand Teton means "large breast" in French. When a group of French
Canadian beaver trappers arrived in 1820, the granite mountains
apparently reminded them of the female anatomy, hence the name. One
imagines they had been traveling a fair while.</TE>
<TE>   Our hike took us through valleys of limestone rock and over
sandstone moraine, dropping into a forest of lodgepole pine and
Douglas fir and fields of pungent sagebrush.</TE>
<TE>   That evening, as dusk lingered over the hayfields and a formation
of Canada geese flew south, we drove 20 minutes into the town of
Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson used to be a gen-u-ine Western cow town. It was
established in 1897 as a marketplace for local ranchers, but these
days much of it has changed into a retreat for wealthy businessmen
and politicians. We were here just after Sept. 11 last year, when
Vice President Dick Cheney had been removed to an "undisclosed secure
location." At the Jackson airport, we observed a very disclosed Air
Force Two on the runway. (Cheney, who grew up in Casper, Wyo., has a
home here.)</TE>
<TE>   There are ways in which the town remains faithful to its Western
roots. At times I felt as though I'd been dropped into central
casting for "Gunsmoke." Window shopping one evening, I overheard a
cowboy sweet-talking an attractive tourist. He wore fringed chaps
over Lee jeans, a vest, denim shirt, silver buckle, bandanna, cowboy
boots and a 10-gallon hat.</TE>
<TE>   The conversation went something like this:</TE>
<TE>   "Howdy, miss. My name's J.J. You enjoyin' our little town here? I
can see you ain't from these here parts. Gals 'round here don't dress
like you do, all purrty-like in a tiny skirt."</TE>
<TE>   "Well," she purred, "I'm from Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   "I ain't never been out West that far," J.J. said. "I hear they
got all sorts of strange folk in that L.A. I hear you got men that
dress up in women's clothing and nobody pays them any mind at all."</TE>
<TE>   I snorted, snapping her out of her cowboy-induced reverie. She
mumbled something and sashayed off. He glowered at me, and I felt
like a snake that had slithered into the bunkhouse.</TE>
<TE>   The Million Dollar Cowboy Bar, opposite the giant elk antler
arches on the town's main square, is a landmark watering trough for
locals and tourists alike and really is worth a stop. You'll see lots
of people dressed like J.J. in the Million Dollar Bar. There are
saloon doors, frightful saddle bar stools (women in miniskirts are at
a significant disadvantage), bartenders with handlebar mustaches, a
dance floor with live western swing music, pool tables and taxidermy
displays in which ferocious animals are frozen in the act of savaging
one another.</TE>
<TE>   The shopping in Jackson is the expected Western apparel--boots,
hats, denim skirts--and various souvenirs, often carved from a tree
stump. But this is, nonetheless, an enchanting town in which original
settler buildings line the streets.</TE>
<TE>   The influx of dollars has also brought good restaurants. We ate
dinner at the fabulous Old Yellowstone Garage on pizza-party Sunday,
when you're served as many slices of gourmet wood-fired pizza as you
can eat, often piled with homemade cheeses. Brunch at the Rusty
Parrot hotel was a home-baked extravaganza, so good that we
overlooked the lax service.</TE>
<TE>   Although we didn't eat there, the swankiest (and costliest)
restaurant in town, locals say, is the Snake River Grill. Off
Broadway and Pato's are trendy with residents for a Friday night
casual meal.</TE>
<TE>   We rose at 6 the following morning to drive into the park to meet
our float trip. In the township of Moose we met the Solitude Float
people and our man John, he of the moose-stomping sagacity.</TE>
<TE>   We piled into a van and were driven to Deadman's Bar, where the
boat put in. The Snake River is not a challenging whitewater ride
(hence the term "float"), but it is visually stunning. For two hours
you ease under the Tetons, through stands of cottonwoods and over
small rapids, finishing back in Moose. All the while there are
eagles, great blue herons, sandhill cranes, mule deer, antelope and
beaver dams to ponder. If you get lucky, you'll chance upon a moose,
a bison or a grizzly.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day we moved to the Triangle X, a 1,300-acre working
dude ranch inside the park. The Turner family has operated the ranch
for four generations, and they had a role in the controversial
creation of the park.</TE>
<TE>   In 1929 they were approached to sell their property to the Snake
River Land Co., a front for an anonymous John D. Rockefeller Jr. They
sold, with the agreement that they could lease the ranch back from
the land company. Rockefeller eventually bought the whole valley this
way, much to the fury of ranchers, who felt they had been gypped.</TE>
<TE>   In 1949 Rockefeller gave 35,000 acres of the valley to the
National Park Service, which added it to the Teton Range and the
Teton National Forest, officially creating Grand Teton National Park
in 1950. Rockefeller kept 1,100 acres for himself, which in 2006 will
be bequeathed to the park. The ranchers may have felt duped, but
Rockefeller preserved one of the world's great wildernesses.</TE>
<TE>   When their land became a park, Triangle X became a park
concession, the only dude ranch inside a national park in America.</TE>
<TE>   When we arrived, we wondered whether the cabins and dining house
were modeled on a Disneyesque cliche of cowboy life. It didn't take
long to realize that it was this type of place on which Disney
modeled its concept of the West. Tiny log cabins stood in front of a
copse of trees. Old chuck wagons sat on the front lawn. There was a
separate dining house with communal tables and a bar area with
stacked-stone fireplace and a stuffed bear.</TE>
<TE>   It was unglamorous but chic at the same time. The cabins are very
basic, with narrow twin beds, lumpy pillows and minuscule bathrooms.
The food is wholesome and flavorful but, again, basic.</TE>
<TE>   The wranglers were the soul of Triangle X. Our favorite was T.J.
Van Ooyen, a tall, beanpole-thin dude with a handlebar mustache. He
loped about in fringed chaps and a black hat with a feather.</TE>
<TE>   T.J. was born in the saddle, he loved Wyoming's outdoors and he
took us on rides with views that can be described only as faultless.
The Tetons looked indigo in the background, the Snake River slipped
molten at their feet and the aspens glowed in the fiery light of
sundown. We returned each evening to drink wine on the porch, stiff,
sore and soporific from the riding.</TE>
<TE>   Foreigners who concentrate on the big cities don't know what
they're missing. I bet they'd have an entirely different impression
of America if they came to places like Jackson Hole. And there would
probably be a whole lot more moose-stomping incidents.</TE>

<HD>Dipping Into the Vegas Pool Analysis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I enjoyed Steve Friess' insightful and informative review of the best
pools, "Vegas' Coolest Pools" (Sept. 15). Our family just returned
from Las Vegas, where we stayed at the MGM Grand. We have a
6-year-old daughter, and pool recreation was our No. 1 feature.
Having stayed at the MGM before, I knew its pool and Mandalay Bay's
were two of the best on the Strip.</LD>
<LD>   Friess says he could not review or glimpse the pool at the Mirage.
However, while waiting for Siegfried &amp; Roy's "Secret Garden" to open,
my daughter and I had a clear view of the pool area and waterfall.
She and I were even allowed to enter the pool area just to check it
out. The employees were friendly and accommodating and told us to
"feel free to test the water." I liked the pool at the Mirage even
better than the MGM. It was larger and more spacious. There are also
several slides and waterfalls, with plenty of shade.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I travel to Las Vegas once a year and always try to stay at a
hotel with a nice pool. I agree with most of Friess' rankings and
plan to stay at the Flamingo on my next trip. But I differ with his
opinion of Treasure Island. The pool is small and usually crowded.
The New York New York pool deserves an F because it is in the shade
most of the day. Also, the Excalibur is better than the Luxor because
it has two large (if not interesting) pools.</TE>
<TE>   We stayed at the Mirage last month and liked the pool. I'd rate it
about a B+, using your system.</TE>
<TE>   ROBERT TROUT</TE>
<TE>   Carlsbad</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One important criterion wasn't included: pool closing times. Many
hotels close their pools at 6 p.m. Many times I've been forced to
leave a swimming pool at an early hour. Now I ask hotel room
reservation clerks what time the pool closes.</TE>
<TE>   RON OLIVER</TE>
<TE>   Newbury Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Monte Carlo's pool closes at 6 p.m. Although management
wouldn't explain why, a worker said "they" wanted people to gamble,
not relax at the pool. Friess gave the pool area a D+; it should have
received an F.</TE>

<LD>I am in the travel business, and I found "With a Click or a Call, the
Scoop Is All Yours" (Travel Insider, Sept. 8) informative. U.S. State
Department country information sheets (www.state.gov/travel) are
usually listed as the first source of reference for travelers, but in
the case of Ecuador, I have found them overly cautious and outdated.
The current posting for Ecuador is dated October 2001.</LD>
<LD>   I would advise travelers to note the date of the posting and
compare it with travel advisories from England (www.fco.gov.uk) or
Australia (www.dfat.gov.au/travel).</LD>
<LD>   Not only are they updated regularly but they also seem less
alarmist.</LD>

<LD>When I came across "A Hidden Jewel in Tuscany" (July 28), my family
scheduled one meal at Villa Vannini while on a trip to Florence.</LD>
<LD>   Our trip to Pistoia involved multiple turns over bridges, steep
mountain switchbacks, pushing back thorny vines from signs to see
which way the arrow was pointing and inching past other cars on
narrow mountain roads. We arrived 2 1/2 hours later.</LD>

<HD>London's Best Hotels for $150 or Less</HD>
<DH>In a city where budget lodgings can be spartan, here are
places for a stylish stay</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYN McGUIRE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>I was on a mission: Find at least 15 good-quality London hotels where
two can stay for $150 or less a night, including breakfast and the
dreaded 17.5% tax. In 10 days, I found 20 worthy candidates that met
my bang-for-the-buck challenge.</LD>
<LD>   With the pound worth about $1.56, that meant no hotel could cost
more than 96 pounds. And the room had to meet my standards: a private
bath, good bedding and lighting, clean surroundings with some charm
and style, a friendly staff and a reasonably convenient location. An
Underground (Tube) station had to be within walking distance--with as
few stops and line changes as possible to make it easy to reach
popular tourist sites, restaurants and shops.</LD>
<LD>   I visited about 50 hotels, saw dozens of rooms and stayed at four
places in four neighborhoods. My research was a mere blip on the
hotel radar screen, considering there are 1,233 hotels in the city
and 161,235 beds, according to the London Tourist Board. Before the
trip I spent hours looking at dozens of Web sites that specialize in
budget hotels. I also looked through numerous guidebooks.</LD>
<TE>   Being familiar with London from past visits, I steered clear of
upscale neighborhoods such as Mayfair and St. James's, which are home
to expensive hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to my 20. Though they call themselves hotels,
they're mainly bed-and-breakfasts because breakfast (continental or
English) is included in the rate. Most places are small and do not
have elevators (staff usually will help carry luggage to rooms) or
air-conditioning, features that are tough to find in this price
category. All rates have been converted at 1 pound to $1.54, the
exchange rate as of the Travel section's press time Tuesday, and
rounded off to the nearest dollar. All but one of the hotels accept
credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a neighborhood-by-neighborhood look at my finds:</TE>
<TE>   Bloomsbury</TE>
<TE>   This area, known for literature, art and learning, is home to the
British Museum, which houses the Elgin marbles, reliefs from the
Parthenon in Athens and the Great Court, which was recently built
around the former British Library's Reading Room building. (George
Bernard Shaw and Karl Marx liked to use it, and part of it is still
used for research.) Not far from the museum is the British Library
(96 Euston Road), where visitors can see the Magna Carta and a copy
of a Gutenberg Bible.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomsbury's literary roots were made famous by the Bloomsbury
Group of writers (Virginia Woolf and Lytton Strachey, among others)
and artists (Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant) who lived in the area and
were active from the early 1900s to about the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Harlingford Hotel</TE>
<TE>   This 43-room hotel, located at Marchmont and Cartwright Gardens,
has been in the family of proprietor Andrew Davies for three
generations.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel, made up of three early 19th century townhouses, has
recently been renovated and looks terrific. Especially eye-catching
is the sophisticated lounge, with modern sofas and chairs in purple.
The large windows that overlook Cartwright Gardens have draperies in
purple and white. A gas fireplace with a large portrait hanging above
is a focal point.</TE>
<TE>   No. 11, in the back of the hotel, has a canopy bed that takes up
almost the entire room. No. 18 has twin beds and faces the garden.</TE>
<TE>   All rooms have non-satellite TV, direct-dial phones, computer
outlets, coffee-and tea-making gear and hair dryers. Most have
showers only. Some front rooms have double-glazed windows.</TE>
<TE>   English breakfast is served in a room opposite the lounge, which
faces the gardens, to which guests can get a key.</TE>
<TE>   No air-conditioning (fans are available); no elevator for the five
floors.</TE>
<TE>   Harlingford Hotel, 61-63 Cartwright Gardens; 011-44-20-7387-1551,
fax 011-44-20-7387-4616, www.harlingfordhotel.com. Tube: Russell
Square, Euston.</TE>
<TE>   Rates: single, $112; double and twin, $140; triple, $156; quad,
$168.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins Hotel</TE>
<TE>   This hotel moved to the top of my list when I found the resident
black Labrador retrievers sitting at the entrance on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Down the street from the Harlingford, the hotel is more English
cozy in character. Botanical prints hang in the hallway, where
windows are dressed in blue and white draperies; a blue rug with
white accents covers the stairway.</TE>
<TE>   Floral curtains and antique-style furniture are used throughout
the 13-room hotel, co-owned for 16 years by Felicity Langley-Hunt and
Sam Bellingham. A few years ago the 18th century hotel was featured
in an episode of the TV series "Agatha Christie's Poirot."</TE>
<TE>   There is no lounge or lobby (guests get keys to come and go), but
the kitchen, with a huge pine table, serves as a reception area.
There's also no elevator, which means that if you're staying on the
top floor (their fourth, our fifth), there are 51 steps from the
entrance. But staff will help with your luggage.</TE>
<TE>   A delicious English breakfast with excellent coffee is served in a
cheery room where tables are set with fresh flowers. A humorous sign
here says, "Please don't feed the dogs." The greeters do tend to hang
out in the room but are well behaved. (If a guest doesn't want their
company, the staff will escort them out.)</TE>
<TE>   Most rooms have only a shower, and these tend to be tiny. Some are
prefabs, a kind of pod that holds the shower, toilet and sink.</TE>
<TE>   Besides non-satellite TV, direct-dial phone and hair dryer, the
rooms have coffee-and tea-making gear, a safe and a small fridge.</TE>
<TE>   There's no air-conditioning, but rooms have fans. Windows are not
double glazed.</TE>

Square, Euston.</TE>
<TE>   Rates: single, $112; double, $133; triple, $164.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Hotel</TE>
<TE>   This 17-room hotel in an 18th century terrace house is popular,
and with good reason: It's around the corner from the British Museum
and a 15-minute walk from West End theaters.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing fancy about the rooms. (A renovation begun last
month is expected to be completed by March.) But they are
air-conditioned, and windows are double glazed. There's TV (CNN is
the only satellite channel), a direct-dial phone and a hair dryer.
Most rooms have showers only. No elevator for the three floors.</TE>
<TE>   English breakfast is served in a paneled room with wood booths.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Hotel, 24 Bloomsbury St.; 011-44-20-7636-3735, fax
011-44-20-7636-3045. Tube: Tottenham Court Road.</TE>
<TE>   Rates: single, $94-$109; double, $137; triple, $203.
Suites/apartments, $187-$254, are not air-conditioned but have
refrigerators.</TE>
<TE>   South Kensington</TE>
<TE>   I chose this area and Earl's Court because travelers can get here
cheaply from Heathrow, London's major airport, on the Piccadilly
line. The hotels I found are within walking distance of the Victoria
and Albert and the Natural History museums.</TE>
<TE>   There are shopping and restaurants on Walton Street, Fulham Road,
Brompton Road and Beauchamp Place, among others. For major shopping
expeditions, a quick Tube stop (Knightsbridge station) away on the
Piccadilly line are Harrods and Sloane Street, home to designer
shops.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cranley Gardens Hotel</TE>
<TE>   With 85 rooms, this qualifies as a hotel, not a B&amp;B, even though a
continental breakfast is included. I wanted to experience staying in
a larger place in this handy location.</TE>
<TE>   Rooms tend to have light-colored walls with pastels for curtains
and bedspreads. Gray and pink or blue and white seem to be favorite
color combinations. Bed headboards have bamboo-like trim.</TE>
<TE>   Rooms in the front on the first floor (second floor to Americans)
have floor-to-ceiling windows that open onto a small terrace facing
Cranley Gardens. I stayed in a front room, No. 108, and even though
the hotel does not have double-glazed windows, traffic noise was not
a problem. I could, however, hear my neighbors and voices in the
hallways.</TE>
<TE>   Four townhouses were connected to create the hotel. It has four
floors, narrow hallways and no air-conditioning, but it does have an
elevator.</TE>
<TE>   Most rooms have showers and tubs, and all have satellite TV,
direct-dial phones, Internet access and a hair dryer. There is good
lighting by the beds.</TE>
<TE>   The lobby has comfortable sofas and a few newspapers, and a bar
lounge serves drinks and sandwiches until midnight; room service is
available from 10 a.m. to midnight. There's also 24-hour laundry
service.</TE>

<TE>   Hotel 167</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks from Cranley Gardens Hotel, this hotel's 19 rooms are
done in a casual look. No. 20 has a bentwood rocker, No. 5 grapevine
wreaths.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven rooms have bathrooms, attractively tiled and with tubs and
showers. Fans substitute for air-conditioning, and hair dryers are
available at the front desk. Rooms have satellite TV, direct-dial
phones, coffee-and tea-making gear and a small fridge. Windows are
double glazed to soften traffic noise from Old Brompton Road.</TE>
<TE>   The lobby doubles as the (continental) breakfast room, its marble
tables and wrought iron chairs juxtaposed with a huge pine hutch.</TE>

<TE>   Swiss House Hotel</TE>
<TE>   This 15-room hotel, next to Hotel 167, has a decidedly English
look, though it used to be the residence for Swissair crews.</TE>
<TE>   The entrance has a weIcoming feel, with a facade of ivy-and
flower-filled window boxes. Wood floors lend a rustic touch to rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Room 202 has a decorative fireplace. The bathroom has a shower
stall and is tiled in blue and white. Like other rooms in the back,
this one looks onto a neighbor's garden.</TE>
<TE>   Rooms are not air-conditioned but do have non-satellite TV, a hair
dryer and coffee-and tea-making gear (no direct-dial phone). Windows
are double glazed.</TE>
<TE>   Continental breakfast is served in a pretty blue-and-white
basement room. There is no elevator to serve the three floors. One
single has a shower but no toilet in the room.</TE>

<TE>   Earl's Court</TE>
<TE>   Earl's Court Road is crammed with shops, restaurants and pubs.
These hotels are just minutes from the Earl's Court Tube station.</TE>
<TE>   Amsterdam Hotel</TE>
<TE>   A riot of color--and I mean that in a good way. Many of the 27
rooms are awash in blues, yellows and mauves.</TE>
<TE>   This hotel has a lot going for it, including an elevator that
serves the six floors. Lighting is good throughout.</TE>
<TE>   Rooms are not air-conditioned but have individual heating, an
uncommon feature. The tiled bathrooms (some with shower only, others
with bath and shower) were some of the best I saw. Room amenities
include direct-dial phone, non-satellite TV, hair dryer and
coffee-and tea-making gear. Front rooms have double-glazed windows.</TE>
<TE>   Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in the back stand out because they have direct
access to the hotel's lovely garden. Continental breakfast is served
in a basement room.</TE>
<TE>   Owner Ahmed Jajbhay's hotel is a few doors away from a lovely
hotel, the Rushmore, owned by his sister; a few streets away is one
owned by his brother, Henley House Hotel. See below for both.</TE>

<TE>   Henley House Hotel</TE>
<TE>   This hotel is one of several on the street that faces Barkston
Gardens. (At some, including this one, guests get keys to the
gardens.) There's a feeling of coziness upon entering the small
lobby, paneled in mahogany.</TE>
<TE>   There are 21 rooms on six floors, and there is an elevator.
Bathrooms have showers only. Bedrooms are tastefully furnished in oak
and mahogany.</TE>
<TE>   No. 12, with two double beds, not only faces the gardens but also
has floor-to-ceiling windows that open onto a small terrace.</TE>
<TE>   Rooms have satellite TV, direct-dial phone, hair dryer, coffee-and
tea-making gear and good lighting. There is no air-conditioning, and
windows are not double glazed, but the street is relatively quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Single rooms are on the top floor. Twin-bedded rooms generally are
larger than rooms with double beds.</TE>
<TE>   Continental breakfast is served in an airy conservatory.</TE>
<TE>   With all this attention to detail, my only quibble is that owner
Hussein Jajbhay should put more than soap in the bathrooms.</TE>

<TE>   This family-owned hotel also faces Barkston Gardens. Two rooms
that look onto the gardens are Nos. 17 and 18. Both are large, bright
and airy, with nice bathrooms. (No. 17 has a bidet.) There are 16
rooms on seven floors and no elevator, but staff will help with
luggage. Rooms do not have air-conditioning but do have double-glazed
windows, non-satellite TV, direct-dial phone, hair dryer and
coffee-and tea-making gear. Bathrooms have soap, shampoo and shower
gel.</TE>

<TE>   Merlyn Court Hotel</TE>
<TE>   I'm including another hotel on Barkston Gardens, the 20-room
Merlyn Court, even though four of its rooms do not have bathrooms and
TVs. (A lounge has a TV.) Rooms have direct-dial phones and hair
dryers. Eggs and bacon are included with breakfast. No elevator for
the three floors.</TE>
<TE>   Although on the spartan side when I visited, the rooms were clean
and comfortable, and rooms are being upgraded with new carpeting and
furniture.</TE>

<TE>   Rushmore Hotel</TE>
<TE>   Owner Shireen Salooga loves mixing colors and using faux finishes,
stenciling and trompe l'oeil touches. All 22 rooms have their own
personalities.</TE>
<TE>   In some (No. 6 is one), Salooga has draped fabric from the ceiling
over the beds to form a free-floating canopy. Other rooms are more
traditional, including No. 14, in Laura Ashley style.</TE>
<TE>   This hotel is for someone who appreciates a room with flair--as
well as with hair dryer, coffee-and tea-making gear, direct-dial
phone and satellite TV. But it is not for anyone who cannot climb
stairs. There are six floors but no elevator, though staff will help
with luggage. The hotel is not air-conditioned.</TE>
<TE>   Bathrooms (some with showers only, others with shower/tub combos)
are tiled in marble and nicely appointed with brass fittings.</TE>
<TE>   Windows are not double glazed, but the street is not noisy. The
conservatory-like room where continental breakfast is served looks as
if it belongs in a hotel charging twice as much. Italy is the
influence for decor, with antique terra-cotta urns, Murano glass
lighting fixtures and wrought iron furniture from Tuscany.</TE>
<TE>   I would have liked some shampoo along with the soap in the
bathroom. Seems like it should be there in a classy hotel like this.</TE>

<TE>   Balmoral House Hotel</TE>
<TE>   The entrance's flowered wallpaper sets the tone for this sweet
33-room hotel in a 19th century Victorian townhouse. Pillowcases are
lace, and bedspreads are in pink and lavender. Some might find the
rooms too feminine.</TE>
<TE>   The rooms have satellite TV, direct-dial phone, hair dryer and
coffee-and tea-making gear.</TE>
<TE>   Most rooms have showers only. Soap and shampoo are provided.</TE>
<TE>   No elevator for the five floors.</TE>
<TE>   An English breakfast is served in an airy basement dining room.</TE>

<TE>   Gresham Hotel</TE>
<TE>   Definitely for the traveler who wants more of a hotel experience
than B&amp;B coziness. Like a lounge and bar, for starters.</TE>
<TE>   The 57 rooms have modern, tiled bathrooms, most with showers only.
All rooms have satellite TV, direct-dial phone and a hair dryer.</TE>
<TE>   Continental breakfast is served in a large dining room in the
basement, and there is an elevator to serve the four floors.</TE>
<TE>   Although some might classify the Gresham as a business hotel
(there are a few "executive" rooms with microwave and fridge for
about $202), I'm including it because it's a nice hotel and the price
is right.</TE>

<TE>   Hotel Columbus</TE>
<TE>   I stayed in No. 204, a double-bedded room that faces the street.
Even though the window is not double glazed, the street noise didn't
bother my light sleeping.</TE>
<TE>   There was an interesting treatment over the bed: A blue-and-white
floral fabric started as a "headboard" and continued up the wall to
form a canopy. It dressed up an otherwise plain room.</TE>
<TE>   The small bathroom was a prefab kind of space, similar to ones at
the Jenkins Hotel. A tight squeeze, particularly in the shower.</TE>
<TE>   I was able to see No. 603, which was a nice size for two. It's the
only ground-floor room and the one to request if stairs are a
problem. There is no elevator for the four floors and 13 other rooms.</TE>
<TE>   All rooms have non-satellite TV and direct-dial phone. Hair dryers
are available at the front desk.</TE>
<TE>   The modern lobby doubles as a breakfast room. Continental
breakfast includes cheese and ham slices, breads, canned fruit,
cereals and good coffee.</TE>

<TE>   Hyde Park Radnor/Springfield Hotel</TE>
<TE>   A note on two other area hotels I liked: Springfield Hotel on
Sussex Gardens and the Hyde Park Radnor, its sister hotel around the
corner. The Springfield has 18 rooms, the Radnor 35. Rooms at both
were tastefully decorated, with more of a traditional English decor
at the Springfield. One caveat: the Radnor's rather unattractive
lobby, which may be in for a renovation.</TE>
<TE>   Both hotels offer satellite TV, a hair dryer and coffee-and
tea-making gear. Bathrooms looked more modern at the Radnor, but only
the Springfield has direct-dial phones. There's an elevator for the
six floors at the Radnor, none for the Springfield's five floors.
English breakfast is included at both hotels.</TE>

<TE>   Victoria</TE>
<TE>   I chose this area because it's close (well, relatively) to major
sites such as Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, the London Eye
and the Tate Britain museum. And in the general area for visits to
the National Theatre complex and Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   As for transportation, Victoria Station is about 15 minutes away.</TE>

<TE>   Blades Hotel</TE>
<TE>   After being buzzed into this hotel, I passed under a pretty
chandelier, headed up the stairs to the conservatory reception area
and met the friendly manager, Kevin Greenan. The hotel was very full,
so he could show me only one room: No. 4 on the ground floor. There
are 16 rooms on four floors. All have showers only and no hair dryer
(ask at reception) or coffee-or tea-making gear. Windows are not
double glazed, so light sleepers might want a room in the back to
muffle traffic on busy Belgrave Road.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel has no air-conditioning and no elevator, but breakfast
is "more substantial than a continental," Greenan says.</TE>

<TE>   New England Hotel</TE>
<TE>   This hotel, in a Georgian townhouse, has been run by the Patel

first-class establishment.</TE>
<TE>   All 25 rooms have tiled bathrooms with enclosed showers that are
temperature controlled. There is no air-conditioning, but heat in
each room can be individually controlled. Windows are double glazed.</TE>
<TE>   All rooms have TV (CNN is the only satellite channel), direct-dial

<TE>   Winchester Hotel</TE>
<TE>   On a block with many hotels that look nice from the outside but
can be disappointing upon closer inspection, this one delivers. In
fact, upon stepping into the classy entry (rose carpeting,
sandstone-colored walls, mirrors, moldings), you might think you are
in tony Mayfair. A great deal of thought and care has gone into
maintaining the quality of the hotel, owned for the last 20 years by
Jimmy McGoldrick and his wife, Juanita.</TE>
<TE>   The overall feeling is tranquil, with walls of the 18 rooms
painted yellow, pink or taupe. Carpeting is red, and bedspreads and
draperies are in gold and cream with red piping. Back rooms are
smaller but quieter; windows are not double glazed, and Belgrave Road
is right outside. All rooms have non-satellite TV. Bathrooms are
tiled and have high-pressure, temperature-controlled showers. Nice,
but I think shampoo should accompany the soap. I would like to see
phones and hair dryers (available at the front desk) in the rooms,
and I wish the hotel accepted credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   Despite my qualms, this is a special hotel. English breakfast is
served on Royal Doulton china, set with Christofle flatware. There's
no lounge, and there is no elevator for the six floors, but staff
will deliver luggage.</TE>

<TE>   Guidebook: London for Little</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: Nonstop service is available from LAX to London on
British Airways, United Airlines, American Airlines, Virgin Atlantic
Airways and Air New Zealand. Continental Airlines has direct service
(one stop). Restricted round-trip fares begin at $756.</TE>
<TE>   Getting from the airports: The cheapest way into London from
Heathrow is the Tube's Piccadilly line; fare is about $5.60. Trains
leave every 10 minutes for the 40-to 55-minute trip.</TE>
<TE>   Another inexpensive way (about $12.50 one way) to reach central
London: Airbus (www.gobycoach.com), which stops throughout the city.

day and take an hour or more to central London.</TE>
<TE>   Heathrow Express, www.heathrowexpress.co.uk, into Paddington
Station ($17 one way), every 15 minutes 9 a.m.-midnight, takes about
15 minutes.</TE>

buses. Day, weekend and weekly passes are offered. For information,
go to a Tube station or check the Web site
www.transportforlondon.gov.uk.</TE>

<LD>If a room is not "en suite" (containing a bathroom inside), it is
called a "basic" room, which means that guests share a bath and
toilet facilities down the hall. We focused on places that had
facilities inside the room. A few places had some rooms that were
"basic."</LD>
<LD>   Either continental or English breakfast is offered. Continental
might be a buffet (cereal, juice, fruit, toast, tea and coffee). An
English breakfast can mean eggs, bacon or sausages, tomatoes, baked
beans and tea or coffee.</LD>
<LD>   Because these are small places, they may not have a lobby or a
common sitting room. There might not be a hotel staffer on duty after
midnight (or earlier), so you may be given a key to let yourself in.
Air-conditioning is a rarity. Some hotels do not allow smoking.</LD>
<TE>   Elevators are generally rare, so when booking remember the
European way of counting floors: Rooms designated as "first floor"
are really on the first floor above ground level--that is, the second
floor--and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Several of these hotels offer little more than soap in the
bathrooms. Remember to take your own shampoo and other toiletries.
Ask about reduced rates for multiple-night stays and "special rates."
Ask if the price quoted is the best they can do. Be aware that the
rate shown on a Web site may not be the lowest.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, read cancellation policies closely. Some hotels charge a
fee regardless of when you cancel. And some charge a transaction fee
for using a credit card.</TE>

<DL>LAMOILLE, Nev.</DL>
<LD>The golden eagle that flew over our car, leading the way up the
winding canyon road, may have been the first clue that we were
entering a special place. Or perhaps it was the two fawns at dusk,
still struggling to learn which way their shaky legs would take them.
Maybe it was the early morning light that turned the Ruby Mountains
to gold, hinting at the riches that miners here once hoped to find.</LD>
<LD>   Beyond doubt, the Ruby Mountains, called Nevada's Alps, are
touched with magic.</LD>
<LD>   We followed in the footsteps and wagon wheel tracks of
sheepherders and miners who, in very different ways, believed they
had struck it rich when they discovered the glacial canyons and
gem-like lakes of this scenic 60-mile-long mountain range.</LD>
<TE>   In the early 1800s, soldiers and other explorers, stopping off on
their way to California, panned the streams for gold. Instead of
yellow flakes, they found red gemstones that they mistook for rubies,
giving birth to the name Ruby Mountains. In fact, those stones turned
out to be garnets--common and inexpensive. Still, the name stuck and
the beauty of this remarkable range remains undimmed by the passage
of time.</TE>
<TE>   The Rubies are mighty, besides being beautiful, with 10 peaks of
more than 10,000 feet in elevation. There are year-round snow fields
and more than two dozen alpine lakes. Popular Lamoille Canyon is
often compared to Yosemite because of its towering peaks and U-shaped
valleys.</TE>
<TE>   In late June, a friend and I joined another couple for five days
of hiking and sightseeing in the Rubies, a scenic wilderness area
that is a leisurely day-and-a-half drive northeast of Los Angeles.
Gloria and I planned to meet Bob and Debbie at Thomas Canyon
Campground, the only U.S. Forest Service campground in the area. Bob
and I had backpacked and hiked in the region from time to time in the
past, once getting trapped in a tent for a couple of days because of
heavy snow. But this trip was designed to be leisure camping. Our
campground had fresh water and a sparkling stream running through it.
If we got tired of our own cooking, we could drive down the road to
the ranching community of Lamoille for a night out on the town.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors don't have to be campers to enjoy the Ruby Mountains.
Accommodations can be found in Elko, Nev., about half an hour away,
or in Lamoille. It is possible to fly from Los Angeles to Elko, the
nearest town with an airport. Or to fly into Reno, about 300 miles
away.</TE>
<TE>   We decided to drive, catching Nevada Highway 93 outside Las Vegas.
Called the Great Basin Scenic Highway, it winds through valleys,
mountains and desert, some of which could pass for the sand-swept
surface of Mars. Great Basin National Park is readily accessible from
this road. The park contains Wheeler Peak, at 13,065 feet the second
highest mountain in Nevada, and ancient bristlecone pine trees. There
also are caves and hiking trails that have little foot traffic.</TE>
<TE>   As we rolled along, we saw country roads, wildlife refuges,
grazing antelope and stretches of highway with not another vehicle in
sight. We stopped overnight at Ely, Nev., before pointing the car in
the direction of the Rubies. At one point we approached an old
railroad crossing and saw a sign near the roadside: "Town for Sale."
Off to the right was a small country store and bar with a cluster of
white buildings behind it and a few old cars and a truck in front.</TE>
<TE>   Soon the Ruby Mountains loomed ahead. As they came into view, it
appeared as though a chunk of the Sierra Nevada had been plucked from
California and dropped into northeastern Nevada. The similarities
between the two mountain chains are striking. Both are glacier-carved
granite ranges dominated by snowcapped peaks, rushing streams and
sparkling lakes populated by hungry trout. The highest summit in the
Rubies is 11,387-foot Ruby Dome, short of the Sierra's 14,495-foot
Mt. Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   The Rubies tend to be greener and a bit wetter than much of the
Sierra. As hikers, we appreciated a couple of other differences too.
The trails are less dusty and less crowded. And there are no bears in
the Ruby Mountains. It's believed that the last black bear was killed
by a rancher in 1910. But mountain lions, mule deer, bobcats, bighorn
sheep, mountain goats, Himalayan snow cocks, Hungarian partridges and
other wildlife abound. Some people even claim to have seen a wolf or
two.</TE>
<TE>   We followed wildflower-lined Highway 229, which crossed Secret
Pass, then dropped down to a dirt road with a sign pointing toward
Lamoille. It is considered the back way in from Ely but is more
scenic than the longer, all-highway route through Elko. We passed
herds of cattle and clusters of horses grazing in the fields and soon
spotted the picturesque town of Lamoille, with the steeple of
Lamoille Presbyterian Church visible in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   From there we climbed Lamoille Canyon, as the sound of rushing
water echoed through the car's open windows. We were on the Lamoille
Canyon Scenic Byway, a 12-mile paved road that takes visitors to
8,800 feet. The road offers breathtaking scenery and access to
various recreational activities, including camping and hiking.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Campground, eight miles up the highway, is at 7,600 feet.
It has 39 well-maintained campsites, 30 of which have tent pads. (The
campground officially closes--usually in late September--for the fall
and winter, but until the road is closed by snow, some die-hard
campers show up to use the grounds anyway.) It took only minutes to
put up our tent with Bob lending a hand. We settled into our
temporary outdoor home and began mapping out plans for hiking, rock
climbing and picture taking.</TE>
<TE>   With our energy restored, we decided to take a stroll along
Lamoille Creek as it tumbled through the campground. Indian
paintbrush, penstemon, shooting stars, mule's ears, bluebells and
geraniums were everywhere. Gloria happily shot pictures, moving from
one group of flowers to the next. That night, under a sky full of
stars, sleep came quickly and solidly.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, as the sun painted the canyon walls in shades of
orange and gold, we converted hot water to hot chocolate and boiled
more water for oatmeal and fruit. We decided to save the sausage for
another morning.</TE>
<TE>   When we were done, we tackled a trail that rose just beyond our
campsite. Small meadows provided a green backdrop against rugged
canyon walls and more distant mountaintops. Within 15 minutes we were
at the first of a series of waterfalls that spill down Thomas Creek.
The creek, fed by snowmelt from above, was inviting but flowing much
too fast to be entered safely. We felt as if we could hike forever,
but the 8,000-foot elevation prompted us to rest and retrace our
steps.</TE>
<TE>   The Rubies offer a range of hiking trails, several of which can be
reached easily from the road that climbs up Lamoille Canyon. Some of
the best trails take off from, or near, the parking area at the head
of the canyon. These include the trails to Lamoille, Liberty and
Island lakes, as well as longer backpack trails to other lakes that
dot the region. Many of the lakes are likely to be frozen in spots
well into the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Lamoille Lake is an hour's hike from the parking area. The trail
to Island Lake takes 1 1/2 to 2 hours and crosses a tumbling creek
that is a good spot to rest. Liberty Lake is a more strenuous climb,
taking about 2 1/2 hours. Views down the canyon are spectacular. All
of these are good family hikes.</TE>
<TE>   Backpackers enjoy the 40-mile Ruby Crest National Recreation
Trail, which begins at the Roads End trail head and follows the crest
of the mountains south to Harrison Pass. The first seven miles are
the most heavily used. The contrast between the hot valley floor, at
5,600 feet, and the crest, at 11,000 feet, catches many people off
guard. The region also is subject to rapid shifts in weather, which
sometimes mean violent storms.</TE>
<TE>   Hikers aren't the only people who enjoy the charms of the Rubies.
Swimmers and boaters use Zumino Jiggs Reservoir. Fishermen like the
mountain streams. Ruby Lake, on the range's southeastern flank, is
abundant with large-mouth bass all summer and with trout spring
through fall.</TE>
<TE>   At the nearby Ruby Lake National Wildlife Refuge, hunters turn out
for ducks and geese October through January; shutterbugs shoot less
common species, such as trumpeter swans and sandhill cranes.</TE>
<TE>   January through early April, the Rubies offer excellent
heli-skiing. The area is known for its deep powder and long virgin
runs, which lure adventurers who have the money to buy a helicopter
ride up the mountains and enough courage to ski down.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Schwandt, a local businessman, is a big booster of the
region. "The Rubies are an undiscovered secret," he said. "I go to
sports shows all over the United States, and people don't believe the
pictures that I show them. This is an unknown wilderness that people
fall in love with."</TE>
<TE>   Schwandt's great-grandparents homesteaded in the area in 1876.
Today he and his wife, Dina, own the JAZ Ranch, Nevada High Country
Outfitters and the Pine Lodge Dinner House and Hotel in Lamoille.</TE>
<TE>   One night we decided to sample dinner at the Pine Lodge, where
Todd's 11-year-old daughter, Stacy, bakes the day's fresh bread. All
four of us ordered chicken Diane. If this was an example of cowboy
cooking, park me next to the chuck wagon. The downstairs dining room
features a diorama of North American wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The next day we shouldered ropes and climbing gear and headed for
the big boulders in Lamoille Canyon for a little rock climbing. The
mountains were etched sharply against the horizon as we worked our
way up the rocks.</TE>
<TE>   On subsequent days we hiked to Liberty and Island lakes on trails
that took us over snow fields remaining from winter.</TE>
<TE>   By the last night, the sound of the stream had become a familiar
lullaby and our sleeping bags as snug and comfortable as a
down-covered four-poster. The campground was nearly full, but each
site was far enough from the next that there was a pervasive sense of
having it all to ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Morning, and packing for the return trip, might break the spell.
But for a short time we had sampled the majesty and mystery of the
mountains, breathed the fresh, clean air and sipped the cold, clear
water. The Rubies may not be the home of precious stones, but they
have a value all their own.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: "It wasn't me; it was the camera," Huntington Beach
reader Ralph Lucas says modestly of this beautiful picture, taken in
June inside a Killarney National Park farmhouse re-creating rural
Irish life in the early 1900s. It had been a gray afternoon, Lucas
says, when the sun broke through the clouds and streamed in through
the window. He aimed his Sony Mavica digital camera, which stores
images on CD, then shot. And shot. And shot. "It can take hundreds of
pictures--so many that you're bound to get lucky," says Lucas, who
took multiple snaps with varying exposure settings. His "Best Shot"
was this picture, which captures the foreboding sky, vibrant grass
and delicate, lacy, sunlit curtains all in the same frame.</CP>

<HD>Grande Dame Hotels Come Back Into View as the Classy Ladies
They Are</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's considered sexist these days to refer to ships as "she," but
that hasn't stopped me from referring to the hotels I like best as
"grandes dames."</LD>
<LD>   These are large, rambling places built around the turn of the last
century, when fashionable women changed their clothes at least three
times a day and thus traveled with great piles of luggage. Women used
to sit on the porch and watch new arrivals whose status was
determined by the number of bags they brought, says Robert Conte,
resident historian at the Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va.,
which qualifies as a grande dame by any measure.</LD>
<LD>   People will quibble about what makes a grande dame besides age and
size. I think of handsome old city hotels as grand hotels, pure and
simple, not as grandes dames, which implies something slightly
different. As much as I adore places like the Plaza in New York, I
think a true grande dame should have a country or resort setting.
Other people require their grandes dames to have rooms that are as
big, fashionably decorated and luxuriously equipped as those at Four
Seasons and Ritz-Carltons. But to me, character and history are more
to the point.</LD>
<TE>   "Does the hotel have a personality apart from the bricks and
mortar?" asks Ian Powell, general manager of the 1908 Fairmont
Empress, an attraction in itself in Victoria, Canada. Afternoon tea
is an institution that as many as 100,000 people a year enjoy. As
late as the 1960s, obituaries of local women routinely mentioned that
the deceased had danced in the Empress' Crystal Ballroom during the
1919 visit of the Prince of Wales.</TE>
<TE>   A grande dame's personality also must be feminine, as the phrase
suggests. With its turrets and stained glass, the 1888 Hotel del
Coronado near San Diego--surely another grande dame--is pretty and
romantic, says Christine Donovan, the hotel's heritage director.
Moreover, she says, grande dame hotels like the Del were often built
by railroad tycoons who fell in love with them after construction was
completed.</TE>
<TE>   Grandes dames sometimes have ghosts, resident historians, museums
and tours for the public, historic rooms (such as the cottages at the
Greenbrier), remarkable architectural features (the long front porch
of the 1887 Grand Hotel on Michigan's Mackinac Island) and
distinctive decor.</TE>
<TE>   After serving as a military hospital during World War II, the
Greenbrier was refurbished by New York interior designer Dorothy
Draper, while the decor of the Grand is the work of her colleague
Carleton Varney. To my eye, the look is fusty elegant, part
Victorian, part Eisenhower era.</TE>
<TE>   These places seem so much like public institutions that people
think they should be able to enter simply because they pay taxes.
About 25 years ago, the Grand--the quintessence of a grande
dame--realized that its public rooms were being inundated with
visitors, not guests.</TE>
<TE>   "Our overnight guests couldn't find a seat in the parlor for tea
or a rocker on the porch," says David Stout, the Grand's general
manager. The hotel began charging people who wanted to see the
premises without staying there. (The fee is now $10.)</TE>
<TE>   I stopped at the Grand in July on a Lake Michigan cruise and
didn't bristle a bit at the fee. It gave me access to the small but
exquisite display of Hudson River School paintings and a chance to
sit in a rocker on the hotel's famed porch, where I had a cool drink
and looked out over the water.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, I did not arrive in cutoffs and flip-flops, which
wouldn't do at a grande dame. Jackets and ties are still required for
men and dressy attire for women in the main dining rooms at the Grand
and Greenbrier (though the Greenbrier has alternate restaurant
choices where the dress code is relaxed). "Part of the playacting
that goes with the Greenbrier is dressing up," says historian Conte.</TE>
<TE>   The Grand's dress code dates to the days of William Stewart
Woodfill, who joined the staff in 1919 as a desk clerk, worked his
way up to manager, bought the hotel during the Great Depression and
once said, "I think [the dress code] really classes up the joint, and
it doesn't cost me a dime."</TE>
<TE>   Some families vacation and celebrate important events at their
favorite grande dame year after year. The Del has hosted three
generations of weddings in a family. Five generations of another
family celebrate Christmas at the Empress every year.</TE>
<TE>   Presidents and princes, movie stars and movie makers favor grande
dame hotels. Sometimes their films become inextricably linked with
the hotel where they were shot. I can't think of the Del without
wanting to rent Billy Wilder's "Some Like It Hot," with Marilyn
Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, filmed there in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in the '60s, many grandes dames fell on hard times and
were lost as vacation habits changed. But this year, two old girls,
the 1865 Mountain View Grand in Whitefield, N.H., and the 1879
Congress Hall in Cape May, N.J., reopened. If it's a trend, I welcome
it. I'm proud to share my gender with them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Glide into some of Europe's most fashionable ports on a low-cost
cruise in the Mediterranean that will carry you through the Italian
and French rivieras, beginning near Rome and ending in Nice.</LD>
<LD>   The nine-day trip, including air fare from Los Angeles and a
seven-day Windstar Cruises voyage, costs $1,445 per person, double
occupancy. And the price includes an outside cabin, a tour escort and
all transfers.</LD>
<LD>   The drawback? You probably should pack an umbrella.</LD>
<TE>   The Nov. 2 trip, aboard the 308-passenger Wind Surf, comes during
the rainiest month in the region. "But that doesn't necessarily mean
you'll get rain," said Can Cetin, president of Troy Tours Inc., the
Los Angeles agency selling the trip. "It's never all that rainy
there. It will be wetter than in summer, no doubt, but that's why the
trip is a bargain." The package usually costs $2,200 or more.</TE>
<TE>   The ship anchors at a different port each day, allowing full-day
visits, and then sails overnight. Monte Carlo, with its glittering
casinos and jet-set glamour, draws a two-day visit. Other port stops
include St. Tropez, France, with its legendary beaches; Portofino,
Italy, considered one of the world's most picturesque ports; and
Porto Vecchio, a resort town near the tip of Corsica.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a stop at the colorful village of Portovenere,
Italy, where small houses--some only 3 yards wide and as much as
seven stories tall--line the shore.</TE>
<TE>   Contact: Troy Tours Inc.; (800) 748-6878, www.troytours.com.</TE>
<TE>   California: Harvest Fun</TE>
<TE>   Wine lovers can get down and dirty this fall with a one-day
package being offered by St. Supery Vineyards and Winery in the Napa
Valley. The hands-on program includes grape picking--and some good,
old-fashioned grape stomping.</TE>
<TE>   The event takes place Fridays through Oct. 18 at St. Supery's
Rutherford estate, a 50-acre vineyard planted in red Bordeaux grape
varieties.</TE>
<TE>   Besides participating in the harvest, guests get a tour of the
winemaking facility, a blending seminar, a lunch prepared by vineyard
chef Ron Barber and an opportunity to talk to winemaker Michael
Beaulac.</TE>
<TE>   St. Supery Winery, one of the top 10 estate holders in the Napa
Valley, specializes in Bordeaux varietals, including Sauvignon Blanc,
Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $250 per person.</TE>

<TE>   Vietnam: Historic Sites</TE>
<TE>   A low-cost 12-day tour to Vietnam will visit Hanoi, Da Nang and Ho
Chi Minh City (Saigon) before moving into Cambodia and the ancient
temples of Angkor Wat.</TE>
<TE>   The itinerary includes a daylong Hanoi sightseeing tour and a
three-night stay at the Hilton Hanoi, two nights at a resort hotel in
the imperial city of Hoi An near Da Nang, and three nights at the
Equatorial Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, with a half-day city tour and
visits to the Thien Hau pagoda and the infamous Cu Chi tunnels, once
a haven for North Vietnamese fighters. The next stop on the tour is
Siem Reap in Cambodia and Angkor Wat, where tour members spend three
nights at the Princess Angkor Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Although the tour visits several areas that became well known
during the Vietnam War, it doesn't draw many veterans, said Pannir
Murugesu, president of Scenic World, the San Francisco agency
packaging the tour. "Mostly the veterans know the area, and they come
and backpack. Most of our clients are Americans over 50 who are
curious about the region and have never been here before. They want
to see Angkor Wat, and they like the price and the hotels."</TE>
<TE>   The package is available for daily departures through Nov. 30 and
between Jan. 1 and May 31.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $2,045 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip
air fare on Singapore Airlines from Los Angeles, San Francisco or Las
Vegas, first-class accommodations, all internal flights, private
sightseeing tours with an English-speaking guide, taxes, service fees
and entry fees.</TE>

dates in October and April, offers an overview of urban and rural
highlights. The itinerary includes Loch Linnhe, Glen Coe, the Isle of
Mull, Loch Ness, Inverness, St. Andrews, the Victorian city of
Glasgow and the Georgian capital of Edinburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the itinerary is a whiskey-tasting and distillery tour, a
stop for tea and scones at a farmhouse and a Scottish banquet with
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $1,568, including round-trip air fare from LAX on British
Airways, accommodations, breakfast daily, six dinners, sightseeing
and admissions.</TE>

<TE>   The trip includes two days of game viewing at Samburu National
Reserve, a visit to the Rift Valley and a stay at Mountain Lodge, a
tree hotel in the Mt. Kenya forest where large animals gather at a
floodlighted watering hole. Two nights are spent on the open plains
at Masai Mara.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $2,895 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip

<HD>Bush Tax 'Cuts': a Dirty Deal for the Middle Class</HD>
<DH>Millions will be forced to pay higher "alternative" rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ready for an unpleasant shock? Try this quiz:</LD>
<LD>   * George W. Bush's well-known pro-family, pro-marriage views are
reflected in his most important domestic initiative. True or false?</LD>
<LD>   * Bush's 10-year "across-the-board" income tax reduction--now the
law of the land--will benefit wealthy taxpayers most, but all
taxpayers will get their fair share because it's their money, not the
government's. True or false?</LD>
<TE>   * While the tax cuts won't simplify the annual misery of filling
out IRS forms, matters aren't going to get worse either. True or
false?</TE>
<TE>   For middle-class and upper-middle-class taxpayers, the answer to
all three: false.</TE>
<TE>   Stand by, America. Families that earn $75,000 to $500,000--those
income tax payers who shoulder half the burden of total income tax
payments--are about to get a surprise kick in the wallet. If you've
closely followed the details of the president's 2001 phased-in tax
cut, you are vaguely aware this nightmare is coming. But now a study
by the respected Tax Policy Center has spelled out the gory details.</TE>
<TE>   The aggravating marriage penalty in our tax law is about to get
worse. The well-established and justified favoritism that our tax law
shows for families with children is about to be radically rolled back
for middle-class and upper-middle-class Americans. As for the
supposed benefits of this across-the-board tax rate reduction? Well,
the middle classes will end up with pennies on each dollar promised
before it's over, and less each year. And if you think filling out
your tax form is complicated now, it's going to be doubly difficult
in the years to come.</TE>
<TE>   The overall result will be a significant shift in tax burden from
the wealthy to those in the middle classes. Consider two groups of
taxpayers: Those earning $100,000 to $200,000 now account for 22% of
total federal income taxes owed to the government. That's the same
percentage shouldered by those earning more than $1 million. By 2010,
however, the share paid by million-dollar-earners will drop to 18%,
while the lower-earning group's share will rise to 27%.</TE>
<TE>   "Hammering the middle class doesn't make any sense to me," says
Leonard E. Burman, a coauthor of the study and director of the Tax
Policy Center, a joint venture of two heavyweight Washington
organizations--the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute.</TE>
<TE>   It makes no sense to me either. Except by the law of unintended
consequences. A generation ago, in answer to a public outcry,
Congress approved something called the alternative minimum tax. It
was a scheme to snag a few rich people--precisely 155 of them in
1969--who took advantage of exemptions and loopholes to avoid paying
any income tax. The trouble is, what was considered wealthy in 1969
is now more or less just a good income. As the Tax Policy Center put
it, this once-targeted "class tax" is about to become a "mass tax."</TE>
<TE>   The dirty secret of Bush's tax cut is that while ordinary income
tax rates were reduced across the board, the rates and terms of the
alternative minimum tax went unchanged. Taxpayers in the middle
classes looked at the new, lowered rates promised under Bush's
package and anticipated their benefits. But many of them did not
realize they would answer instead to this different tax formula.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, barely 2% of the nation paid these alternative rates.
By 2010, they will apply to a majority of people earning between
$50,000 and $100,000 and 95% of those who earn between $100,000 and
$500,000, according to the tax center's study.</TE>
<TE>   How is the AMT calculated? You'll have to ask your accountant.
Don't have one? You will. The alternative minimum tax will require
millions of Americans to compute their federal taxes twice--first
under the regular schedule and then a second time at a tax rate of
either 26% or 28% of income without benefit of personal exemptions,
meaning exemptions for children, or standard and itemized deductions
for such things as state taxes. You'll have to pay the greater
amount.</TE>
<TE>   Because the alternative tax will grab taxpayers incrementally,
according to individual circumstances and the gradual phase-in of
Bush's tax cuts, the outcry has been muted so far. But don't expect
it to stay that way. By 2010, this higher alternative tax will bring
in $141 billion to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Tax Policy Center's appalling findings are the best reason yet
to reopen debate on Bush's tax cuts, and now--before the alternative
tax becomes the mainstream tax.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, whether the nation can afford a sweeping reduction in
revenues during wartime remains a burning question, but there should
be no question that it's wrong to penalize marriage and families, to
shift a greater burden of government finance to the middle classes
and to make tax day an even more complicated ordeal.</TE>

<HD>Playing Into Evil's Hands</HD>
<DH>The U.N. is worse than irrelevant. It has enabled
brutality--even genocide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH A. BOSCO</AU>
<BD>Joseph A. Bosco teaches a graduate seminar on
international law and morality at Georgetown University's School of
Foreign Service.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Critics accuse President Bush of undue harshness in condemning the
United Nations to "irrelevance" if it fails to heed Washington's call
for decisive action against Iraq. Actually, the president pulled his
punches. A less charitable and more accurate assessment of the world
body would note its relevant--but harmful--role as enabler and
facilitator of aggression, humanitarian catastrophes, even genocide.</LD>
<LD>   Far from fulfilling its mandate to enforce international peace and
security, the U.N. has often served instead to allow governments to
hide their own passivity behind the protective cover of international
action--or more likely, inaction.</LD>
<LD>   For their part, lawless dictators such as Slobodan Milosevic and
Saddam Hussein have found the U.N. quite useful as they went about
their brutal business.</LD>
<TE>   After it launched its war against Bosnia's Muslims in 1991,
Yugoslavia raced to the U.N. Security Council and received permission
as a nonmember to introduce a resolution the council dutifully
adopted, imposing an arms embargo on the nation--the only time a
state has requested sanctions against itself.</TE>
<TE>   The result was to freeze the Serbs' weapons monopoly and to
deprive Bosnia of the means to defend itself--a right guaranteed
under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. That preemptive diplomatic
strike by Belgrade proved highly successful and set the pattern for
U.N. fecklessness and complicity during the next 3 1/2 years and in
more than 100 ineffective Security Council resolutions. The council
statements were always couched in stark moral terms and suggested
stern action. But the torture, mass rapes and massacres continued as
the world looked on.</TE>
<TE>   Worse than futile rhetoric, the Security Council took additional
actions that served to enhance Milosevic's ability, through the likes
of Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, to carry out evil schemes. It
established six Bosnian "safe zones" where besieged Muslim men, women
and children could gather under the protection of U.N.
"peacekeepers." This inadvertently concentrated the targets for
Serbian bombers and snipers. The ultimate shame of the U.N. was
Srebrenica, a safe zone, where lightly armed (and morally disarmed)
peacekeepers stood by helplessly as Serb forces rounded up busloads
of men destined for certain execution.</TE>
<TE>   On other occasions, Serbs boldly seized hundreds of blue-helmeted
U.N. soldiers as hostages, using some as human shields against
Western air attacks. By the time the United States had seen enough of
U.N. peacekeeping and pushed for the use of force against the Serbs,
more than 200,000 Bosnian Muslims had died and 2 million had been
made refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Similar U.N. paralysis characterized the response to Serb
atrocities in Kosovo. That time, after a year's delay, the U.S. led a
NATO operation that bypassed the Security Council, avoiding certain
Russian and Chinese vetoes. And in Rwanda, where minimal intervention
could have prevented the slaughter of a million Tutsis, the Security
Council, with Washington's shameful collaboration, strove
successfully not to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   The situation with Iraq shows again how counterproductive it can
be when the U.N. asserts legal authority over a situation: It can
provide the excuse for states to shirk their own responsibilities
even when the U.N. falters.</TE>
<TE>   The invasion of Kuwait provided a clear case of international
aggression, and vigorous American leadership pushed the organization
to carry out its mandate. But since then, the Security Council has
been all too willing to look the other way as Baghdad flouted its
resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   While Secretary-General Kofi Annan finds his Iraq diplomacy more
effective when backed by a credible threat of force, he has won only
Hussein's false promises. Now he has withdrawn from further
"negotiations," which Washington opposes, after helping Iraq draft
yet another empty letter.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has said he will not allow U.N. diplomacy to
subvert the U.N.'s mission. Failure to enforce Security Council
resolutions does more than make the organization irrelevant; it makes
it complicit in Iraq's dangerous violations of international law and
its escalating threat to international peace and security.</TE>

<LD>The city has heard more from Mayor James K. Hahn in the last week
than it's heard from him in a month of Sundays--how he's going to
change the Los Angeles Police Department and its "reform-resistant"
culture, how he isn't going to worry about being "politically
correct."</LD>
<LD>   The mayor was sending up a flare, telling Los Angeles that he was
going to do something unanticipated. And indeed, the three finalists
for police chief are all from outside the department, and that's
surprising. The question remains which of these three men is best
suited to do the hard work that must be done: effectively fighting
crime without abusing power, winning the trust of the rank and file
and maneuvering through the banal and petty politics that often
govern City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn's vote is all that truly matters, since the City Council is
expected to endorse his decision. We suspect he will act quickly.</LD>
<TE>   The choices are former New York Commissioner William Bratton,
former Philadelphia Commissioner John Timoney and Oxnard Chief Art
Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton was on the team monitoring the LAPD's federal consent
decree, which the city entered into last year after the Justice
Department found a "pattern or practice" of civil rights violations.
He is celebrated on the East Coast for New York City's precipitous
drop in crime in the mid-1990s. Not everyone gives him credit for the
decline, however, and some criticize the methods used by the NYPD,
pointing to a more than 50% rise in complaints of police misconduct
in minority communities.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney, who worked as Bratton's deputy in New York, can claim
familiarity with many of the problems plaguing the LAPD from his
stint overseeing a troubled and demoralized Philadelphia department,
also under federal oversight. But his roots are in the East, he
doesn't know Los Angeles and in at least one case that we know of he
failed to discipline an officer who badly need it.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez spent almost 30 years in the LAPD, working his way from beat
cop in North Hollywood to deputy chief and commanding officer of the
Central Bureau before he became police chief of Oxnard's 325-person
force. Last year, Oxnard officers fatally shot five people, three of
them mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   No veteran police chief could have a career without tribulations,
and certainly Bratton, Timoney and Lopez have had theirs. The victor
should be the man who has consistently demonstrated how to fight
crime aggressively without abusing anyone's civic rights and how to
balance officer morale with discipline. Hahn must probe their
commitment to civilian oversight and definitions of community
policing.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Hahn's decision will understandably be influenced by
personal chemistry, but that shouldn't be the determining test. After
all, though former Chief Bernard C. Parks may have taken the idea to
an extreme, Hahn needs a chief who is unafraid to tell him what he
doesn't want to hear.</TE>

<LD>Imagine you're a Martian Margaret Mead dispatched to Earth to study
social customs like the courting and marriage relationships of
humans. You watch these people closely--how they dress to attract
others, and the perfumes, dances, flirting and kissing as they fall
hopelessly, intoxicatingly, head over heels in love with each other,
at least for a while.</LD>
<LD>   Then, as a thorough sociologist, you read a new biography of
Russia's chief executive and new court documents about General
Electric's former chief executive that open revealing windows into at
least two of these intimate relationships.</LD>
<LD>   Vladimir is a Russian who meets an airline flight attendant named
Lyudmila. On dates he often leaves her near tears waiting up to 90
minutes on barren subway platforms, according to "Vladimir Putin: The
Road to Power." She waits anyway. He loves her so much he lies about
his profession, like the spy he is. Once married, he's chronically
late for dinner, expresses no apology or appreciation for her patient
care but when asked says the now-overcooked meat is dry. When their
first daughter is born, he's out of town. She grabs a cab to the
maternity ward, where he arrives a day late announcing the girl will
be named for his mom. Vladimir Putin is held in such high esteem he's
running the country.</LD>
<TE>   Then there's Jack Welch, an executive hotshot who dumps the mother
of his four children after 28 years, mentioning the divorce in only
two paragraphs of his autobiography. Soon he's remarried, to a savvy
corporate lawyer named Jane who, before their wedding, agrees to a
property settlement in the event of divorce but, clever woman,
stipulates an expiration date. Three years after that date passes and
shortly after public disclosure of Jack's affair with a writer
profiling him for a once- respected business magazine, the wife files
for divorce. In so doing, she claims living expenses of $126,820 to
$634,487 a month.</TE>
<TE>   To enhance her leverage, Jane details for the court and waiting
worlds the generous provisions of Jack's retirement from a grateful
GE. That employer so appreciated his ruthless management and boosting
of stock values by more than $450 billion that it provided jets,
maids, furniture, foods, flowers, sports tickets and toilet paper for
his several homes. Jack Welch was held in such high esteem that in
his last year of running the company he was paid $1,906 an hour, day
and night. That's as much each hour, by the way, as the Russian
president earns each month.</TE>
<TE>   So now, everyone obviously knows that the typical human marriage
is either a convenient spy cover gone homey or a corporate merger
inevitably destined for divestiture.</TE>

<HD>11 Million Acres of Shame</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 300,000 Native Americans should be receiving about $500
million a year from the Department of the Interior in royalties
collected on oil, gas, coal, timber and grazing operations on 11
million acres of Western lands held in trust for the Indians since
1887. Now here's a surprise: They are getting only a fraction of
that. A lot isn't getting collected in the first place. Some is being
held in a trust fund. And much of it has flowed into the U.S.
Treasury to be spent on other things.</LD>
<LD>   Interior's management of the trust created to handle this money is
so bad that a federal judge last week held Secretary of the Interior
Gale A. Norton in contempt of court in the most scathing of terms.
U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, a former federal lawyer, branded
Norton an unfit administrator and said, "I have never seen more
egregious misconduct by the federal government." He ordered Norton to
come up with an adequate reform plan by January and appointed a
"master monitor" to oversee the operation.</LD>
<LD>   Lamberth found Norton and an aide guilty of five counts of civil
contempt, including the filing of false reports on attempts to reform
the trust and lying about computer security of trust fund data. The
Interior Department was forced to shut down its Web site in late 2001
when it discovered that hackers could easily access and manipulate
trust fund data.</LD>
<TE>   Mismanagement of the trust fund is not new. Bill Clinton's
Interior and Treasury secretaries also were held in contempt for
trust fund actions. The handling of the trust has been a scandal from
the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   In 1887, Congress allotted the land to individual Indians in
compensation for the loss of tribal reservations taken for the use of
settlers. The government held the land in trust and would lease it to
miners, loggers and oil and gas companies. The Indians were supposed
to get the royalties the federal government collected on the resource
production. Lawyers for the Indians living throughout the West,
including California, estimate they are owed at least $10 billion in
royalties that were lost, stolen or not properly accounted for.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, a Senate committee tried to investigate
allegations that oil and gas companies were conspiring to cheat the
trust fund. The probe ended inconclusively when investigators said
they did not have the resources they needed to do the job.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Department now is trying to determine which heirs of
the original American Indian beneficiaries have trust funds coming
and how much they are owed, a job that is expected to take 10 years
and cost about $2.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Interior officials are considering an appeal of
Lamberth's contempt ruling even though the judge imposed no penalty.
They would be far better off using that money and energy to fix the
trust fund mess.</TE>

<LD>Re "Former GE Chief Has 'Met His Match' in Divorce Court" and "SEC
Probes Welch's Benefits," Sept. 17: I am astonished and saddened by
the irony of a front-page story about a high-profile divorce
presented, in part, as a warning against the shrewd and powerful
woman--the kind of story that used to be relegated to the society
pages--while one had to go to the Southern California Living section
to find "A Baby and an Outcry," a story about a Nigerian woman who's
been sentenced to death by stoning for being a single mother.
(Although that article continues opposite a fashion spread including
a large photo of a model's half-naked backside.)</LD>
<LD>   The Times' sense of news priority reflects our tolerance for the
oppression of women, our lack of outrage and our fear of powerful
women, proving that sexism is alive and well.</LD>

<TE>   I read with fascination and wonderment about the impending divorce
action of Jack and Jane Welch. What a tale of human excess and
behavior! It is a tale of human self-indulgence and greed almost
beyond belief. In plain language I would describe it as wanton,
unbridled gluttony. We could add to the list Kenneth L. Lay, the
Rigas family, Gary Winnick and L. Dennis Kozlowski. And, in plain
everyday language, I would describe the attempt to justify such
excessive CEO rewards as corporate, obfuscatory jabberwocky. In plain
language, that's my opinion. I am 89 years old, and I should know.</TE>

<TE>   My early cup of coffee was ruined by your report of the lifestyle
of Kozlowski ("Tyco Details Extravagance of Ex-CEO," Sept. 18).
During lunch hour, listening to Warren Olney's "To the Point" on the
radio, I was disturbed again by guests describing our local
health-care system as the Chernobyl of our infrastructure. I am not a
communist, a bleeding-heart liberal or a Robin Hood--simply a retiree
on a fixed income. The above news makes me very sad.</TE>

<LD>Re "We Need Answers, Mr. Bush," editorial, Sept. 20: Bravo!</LD>
<LD>   Too many equate patriotism with accepting the reasoning and the
proposals of President Bush without regard to evidence. Bravery is
required of our elected representatives. I would hope that all
clear-thinking and truly patriotic voters would support those
legislators who are willing to require more proof from the president
for the need to attack Iraq, and vote for them in November.</LD>

<TE>   The Bush administration has no time when it comes to dealing with
Iraq. We would be wise to ask why there is this frenzied desperation
to act now. If weapons inspectors are allowed back into Iraq, what
would serve us better than time? If it takes a year ... five years
... 10 years, why would that be a problem? It seems to me that the
longer it takes, the better for us and the world as a whole. The only
"loss" would be the administration's shaky justification for its
alarming daily exhortations to war.</TE>

<TE>   I literally became ill when reading that the Catholic bishops were
questioning the moral legitimacy of war ("Catholic Bishops Oppose a
Unilateral War on Iraq," Sept. 18). Where do they get the time for
these conferences? Given the recent history of their involvement with
the "young boy" issues, I cannot think of anyone or any group I would
trust less. Clean your own house before you come to mine.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is about time that U.S. Catholic bishops voiced concern over
Bush's push for an attack on Iraq. It would have been better had they
spoken out much sooner because now many Catholics have decided that
this would be a just war. The church authority is supposed to guide
its flock, not remain silent while the horrors of an immoral war
begin. Now the Vatican needs to speak out; its silence is approval.
Jesus Christ would never condone this ugly, aggressive and unprovoked
assault on a country already destroyed by our previous bombs, its
children starving by our sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who calls himself a Christian, is not behaving like one.
Christ taught nonviolence and non-bloodshed. Christ told us to love
our enemies and do good to those who hate us.</TE>
<TE>   Alethea Guthrie</TE>
<TE>   Malibu</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bush is wrongheaded for putting the American war effort in terms
of what the United Nations will and won't allow. The U.S. was never
created with the intention of subjecting the citizenry to an
arbitrary power, let alone one that is ultimately unaccountable, such
as the U.N. is. The U.N. is still something of a rogues' gallery. I
was sickened to hear representatives from the Palestinian
territories, Iran and Iraq, among others, implore authorities to
operate for peaceful cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   The agenda of lowering sanctions against terrorist states,
replacing war on tyrants with negligible weapons inspections and
advocating widespread disarmament of free states is an affront to
countries that already have a track record of peaceful operation.
It's time to give war a chance.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the Gulf War we attacked Iraq for what it did to Kuwait. Now,
Bush wants to attack Iraq for what it might do down the road.
According to this "logic" we can attack any country, jail anyone,
execute anybody for what they might or might not do in the future.
This logic is insane.</TE>

<LD>I teach in the L.A. Unified School District and have for 20 years.
This year the school board and Supt. Roy Romer raised class size by
two students per academic class. That increase in class size--along
with all the other district guidelines and foibles--has resulted in
the following at my school: All academic classes will have 40 to 41
students. This is the number that the board and Romer can live with.
How can any teacher teach 41 students effectively?</LD>
<LD>   The LAUSD saved $70 million by raising class size, then found $228
million and called that good management. Here is the point: The only
way that class size will be lowered is by parents demanding it. If
parents are not calling and e-mailing their elected officials every
day, then class size will never change.</LD>

<LD>Reducing false positives by comparing current mammograms to previous
films makes sense (Sept. 18). What does not make sense is the
practice by U.S. physicians of not routinely providing patients with
a copy of their results, even though the patients are the legal
owners of the original film. Ensuring that patients are provided
copies of all mammograms would facilitate the double-checking of
results advocated by Dr. Joann Elmore without creating the monopoly
relationship for the physician that guarantees future referrals.
Obtaining copies later creates unnecessary hassles for patients if a
new facility is used.</LD>

<LD>Punch-card ballots are inexpensive, reliable when used properly,
durable and simple. To replace them with expensive electronic systems
that may intimidate voters or crash is a mistake. The latest Florida
fiasco is an example of just how well these "improved" systems work
(Sept. 12).</LD>
<LD>   I routinely file an absentee ballot. I check the ballot to be sure
that the holes are cleared and that there are no hanging chads. Is it
too much to ask other voters to do the same? In nonlife-threatening
applications, a computer failure rate of 1% is not unexpected. In an
election with a razor-thin margin, that would not be acceptable.</LD>

<LD>I have never heard of Aimee Liu, nor PEN USA, of which she is
president (Commentary, Sept. 13). But I have one question to ask of
her: Who are those "who warn us to hoist the Stars and Stripes--or
else"? I and everyone I know proudly fly the flag with no coercion
from anyone; and if the USA Patriot Act prevents further terrorism, I
can only say, "Thank God."</LD>

<LD>Amir Taheri makes some excellent points about political realities and
assassinations in Afghanistan ("Welcome to Assassin-istan,"
Commentary, Sept. 16). But he also perpetuates certain unfortunate
stereotypical notions, as if Afghanistan of the 21st century would be
better off if it were left to be the collection of tribal fiefdoms it
has been for the last few centuries. The days of Afghanistan being a
buffer state in the midst of regional competing powers ended with the
Soviet Union's implosion. Left alone, Afghanistan is not only an
impoverished land, it is a major security threat to the United
States, as events of Sept. 11 showed vividly.</LD>
<LD>   Afghanistan needs to leap forward into the 21st century in a hurry
and become a modern, pluralistic democracy and a market economy. This
can only happen with outside aid, and the only source the Afghans can
turn to is the United States, which has now been engaged in
Afghanistan with significant regional implications for the second
time in two decades.</LD>
<LD>   Afghanistan must be the first step in the transformation of South
and Central Asia and the Middle East to modern, pluralistic
democracies and open markets. That is the only way to rescue
generations of Afghans and others in the region from war, terror,
backwardness and poverty.</LD>
<TE>   The truth is that only the United States has the resources, the
influence and the global reach to do this for its own security as
well as for those in the region. Welcome to the age of the global
village.</TE>

<LD>Re "Archdiocese to Cut Programs, Jobs to Close Budget Gap," Sept. 19:</LD>
<LD>   "Dear Southern California Edison: It's not that I don't want to
pay my electric bill, it's just that I can't because I have to use
that money to pay for my new Rolls Royce." That is the logic Cardinal
Roger Mahony is using to defend the actions the Archdiocese of Los
Angeles is taking to close a $4.3-million deficit by laying off
scores of workers and shutting down much-needed ministries.</LD>
<LD>   He insults my intelligence. Just 2.3% of the $189 million spent on
Mahony's Monstrosity would have saved all of those jobs and
ministries, and 4.6% would have doubled those jobs and ministries and
still left over $180 million to build. There is a definite parallel
here between the new cathedral and the tower of Babel. Mahony's
explanation sounds like babble to me.</LD>

<AU>CHARLOTTE ALLEN</AU>

Search for the Historical Jesus."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With much fanfare, former General Electric CEO Jack Welch decided
last week to give up a $2.8-million-a-year post-retirement perk
package that included such GE-subsidized goodies as access to company
airplanes, an apartment in New York complete with maid service, New
York Knicks tickets, limos, country club memberships, satellite TV in
his four homes and even free meals--all on top of the
$9-million-a-year lifetime pension. The timing of his giveback
coincided with the announcement that the Securities and Exchange
Commission plans to investigate Welch's retirement deal.</LD>
<LD>   It has been a bad time lately for CEOs and high-ranking corporate
executives in general. Not just the Enron crowd, or Adelphia's John
J. Rigas doing the perp walk, or Tyco's L. Dennis Kozlowski facing
charges that he cheated his company out of $600 million. There is
increasing scrutiny of executives' compensation packages. CEO perks
once taken for granted in corporate life--clothes, apartments,
bodyguards, private school tuition for the kids--are being
scrutinized. Few shareholders cared about those extras when the
economy was rolling; now, the perks look like greed.</LD>
<LD>   No, we haven't suddenly become more high-minded, and we haven't
suddenly soured on capitalism. It's not simply the stagnant economy
that has made us suspicious of, or perhaps jealous of, fat-cat CEOs.
We are simply experiencing icon shift.</LD>
<TE>   Until just recently, top-performing corporate executives such as
Welch, even when they were more feared than loved, occupied an
unassailable place in the American mental galaxy. They were, after
all, believed to be responsible for the vast and widely diffused sea
of prosperity on which huge numbers of middle-class Americans happily
sailed just a short while ago. Many middle-class people saw the value
of their homes soar hundreds of thousands of dollars. Americans, on
the one hand, decried Microsoft's Bill Gates as a predator and, on
the other, gobbled up news about his marriage, his underground
mansion and his latest charities. He might have been a monopolist,
and his software might make users sputter, but few really begrudged
him his $43-billion personal fortune. Now, Gates and his ilk are out.
They're over. They're yesterday's icons.</TE>
<TE>   Icon shift seems to occur every decade or so. It is partly
cyclical, and it is partly driven by events. The most dramatic icon
shift in recent American history occurred during the late 1960s. The
Vietnam War, ineptly strategized by Washington brain-trusters, did
not simply waste tens of thousands of young lives; it also dissolved
in a flash an ideal of tough, stoic, tight-lipped American manhood
that had been an iconic staple since the 1950s. Soldierly values were
out, cops were "pigs," and the off-to-work, briefcase-lugging family
dad was a dull square. So, for the 1970s, we switched icons and we
got the Alan Alda-esque "sensitive man" who couldn't stop yakking to
his therapist. We got Jimmy Carter, we got stagflation, we got
seemingly endless, maundering "malaise."</TE>
<TE>   By decade's end, Americans had had enough of that, and the era of
Ronald Reagan ushered in new icons for the free market and the
prosperity roll that marked Reagan's presidency: the tough-minded
corporate chairman who knew how to turn his company around (think Lee
Iacocca--or Welch) and the yellow suspender-wearing junk bond dealer.</TE>
<TE>   The 1980s model of CEO was crude by today's standards, and at any
rate, the recession at the end of that decade, coupled with a
Democratic presidency for the first time since Carter's, required the
creation of a new icon for the 1990s. That decade, of course, turned
out to be even more prosperous than the 1980s, so its icon was once
again a CEO--but a "new economy" CEO who combined 1970s sensitive
tastes and concerns with the leveraging talents and spending habits
of an 1980s junk-bonder. Think Larry Ellison of Oracle (America's
third-richest cyber-magnate after Gates and Microsoft co-founder Paul
Allen, according to Forbes magazine) or the once much fawned-over
Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy, a dot-com highflier until its stock
collapsed two years ago amid accounting irregularities. Think ashrams
in Aspen for fiber-optics billionaires. Think celebrity chefs.</TE>
<TE>   Writer David Brooks caught the zeitgeist of these characters with
dead-on hilarity in his survey of 1990s culture, "Bobos in Paradise."
They were the "bobos," the bourgeois bohemians of America's new mass
elite, the latte-swillers who combined the homespun with the
extraordinarily high-end. The iconic dad of the 1990s was the guy
with the Rolex President Perpetual Day-Date and the toddler in the
Peg-Perego stroller cell-phoning his office at the Whole Foods
organic spelt bin.</TE>
<TE>   But now, we are living in a new decade and a new millennium, and
icon shift has struck again. The bobos among us now look a tad
frivolous in their concerns and consumption patterns. Sept. 11
brought a gravity to the national scene that has not yet left us, and
the objects of our reverence are now cops and firefighters, guys who
can't afford Prada but know how to rush into burning buildings.</TE>
<TE>   CEOs in Hugo Boss trench coats and celebrity chefs already seem
passe (real men neither eat nor can afford the tab for chanterelle
foam). We just finished a war against the harborers of terrorists,
and we may be fighting another war very soon on a much larger scale.
The values associated with war--bravery and patriotism--have made a
proud return (and war movies like "Black Hawk Down" and "We Were
Soldiers" were this year's hits).</TE>
<TE>   So, when Welch voluntarily downsized his GE retirement package
last week, we had to give him credit for one thing: He knew how to
read the signs of the times.</TE>

<AU>VIKRAM AMAR</AU>
<BD>Vikram Amar is a professor of law at UC Hastings
College of Law.</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>As a robot searched for explosives in a car driven by one of three
men of Middle Eastern descent suspected of being terrorists, federal
and state law enforcement officers watched from a safe distance. A
major Florida highway had been closed, creating a huge traffic jam.
Tens--if not hundreds--of thousands of tax dollars were being spent
to check out a terrorist threat. All this because a nurse in a
northern Georgia restaurant claimed to have overheard the trio
discussing an imminent terrorist attack that was to take place in
Miami. As Florida Gov. Jeb Bush proudly announced, "This system
works."</LD>
<LD>   I suppose that depends on what system you're talking about. If
"the system" means the official government response to terrorist
scares, perhaps things worked as well as can be expected in our
post-Sept. 11 world. After all, the police closed the road, put on
special bomb-protection gear and called in the robot only after they
had determined the threat was credible.</LD>
<LD>   They had interviewed Eunice Stone, the nurse who had contacted
authorities. She told police--and has since maintained her
story--that she clearly heard the men laughing at the 9/11
remembrances airing on television at a coffee shop. One of them said,
she claimed, that "if they [Americans] mourn Sept. 11, what will they
think about Sept. 13?" Another talked about "bringing down"
something.</LD>
<TE>   Furthermore, before detaining the men, the police followed their
two cars, whose license plate numbers Stone had provided, and
witnessed the apparent failure of one of the drivers to stop and pay
at a toll booth. (Since then, the police, based on a review of
videotape, have dismissed the citation they issued the driver for the
alleged violation.) Again, before pulling out all the stops, the
police conducted a relatively unobtrusive search of the cars using
explosive-sniffing dogs. When they indicated the possible presence of
black powder, officials took drastic action.</TE>
<TE>   Although the search turned up no bombs or other explosive
materials, the cops probably acted properly based on the
information--and the reasonable inferences they could draw from
it--that they had at the time. Even the three men, all medical
students, who said they were questioned for 12 hours without being
told why they were being detained, do not blame the police. On CNN's
"Larry King Live" last week, the students said the police acted
professionally and correctly in responding the way they did. All in
all, the governmental system seemed to have worked, if a bit
expensively.</TE>
<TE>   But the "system" that matters is not just governmental. It is also
societal. And here the system may not have worked so well. There are
a number of possible explanations for what happened. First, the
medical students might have conspired to create the impression Stone
got, either because they were in the mood for a sick practical joke
and/or because they were tired, as they said on "Larry King Live," of
being viewed suspiciously in public places.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of a hoax, whether motivated by understandable feelings
of unfair treatment or not, is unacceptable. Sept. 11 is no laughing
matter. Neither is playing on the fears--even the hysterical and
perhaps ethnically insensitive fears--of a nervous nation. For these
reasons, an intentional hoax, if proved, could itself be the basis
for criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   The medical students, two of whom are American citizens and all of
whom profess loyalty to the United States, vehemently deny that they
engaged in any such hoax. They further deny ever referring to either
Sept. 11 or Sept. 13 in their conversation. "Bringing down"
something, they contend, referred to a car one of the students wanted
to transport to Miami, where they were to begin training at a
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The students' steadfast denials lead to a second possibility: that
Stone made up the story and intentionally misled police. This
scenario, while also criminal if true--knowingly making false reports
to police is a no-no--seems unlikely. Stone, by all accounts, had no
incentive to victimize the men. More generally, she does not seem
like the kind of person to purposefully lie to the police.</TE>
<TE>   All this leads to a third, and perhaps most likely, possibility:
that no one is really lying, but that Stone seriously misheard or
misinterpreted the men's conversation. This possible mistake by
Stone, even if negligent, is not something the law has a remedy for.
By misreading the situation, even unreasonably misreading the
situation, she did not break any law.</TE>
<TE>   Yet negligent overreaction is precisely the glitch in the system
that might persist. All mistakes that lead to restrictions on an
innocent person's freedom are troubling. What is especially worrisome
is that particular kinds of mistakes may get repeatedly made in such
a way as to wrongly cast suspicion on and limit the freedoms of
particular people because of their skin color and appearance--that
is, racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   It seems extremely likely that the medical students' Middle
Eastern appearance played some role in how Stone interpreted what
they said. Three blond and blue-eyed kids cruelly joking about 9/11
would probably generate much disdain--but very little
suspicion--among residents of northern Georgia who overheard their
remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Racial profiling is vexing precisely because it is not completely
irrational. A person's Middle Eastern appearance may correlate with
citizenship from one of a number of countries where hatred of the
United States is prevalent. As the arrests of five U.S. citizens of
Yemeni descent--four born in the U.S. and the fifth naturalized as a
teen--near Buffalo, N.Y., Sept. 13 suggest, Middle Eastern ethnicity
may generate a minute correlation with terrorist intent even among
U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   But correlations are frequently just small statistical overlaps.
The overwhelming majority of people of Middle Eastern descent, both
U.S. citizens and visitors here, are not terrorists or terrorist
sympathizers. Whether it is fair to act on a small ethnic correlation
and burden large numbers of innocent people depends on whether we all
would be willing to submit to suspicion if our ethnicity generated an
equally small, albeit positive, correlation with terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to know whether the system is living up to a
golden-rule standard: racially profile only when you would be willing
to be racially profiled. But a number of factors can help us answer
that question. For example, the more that profiling is limited in
time and space, the more willing we all would be to submit to it
ourselves. The Florida incident took place during an unusual week in
that it marked the one-year anniversary of Sept. 11 and was the
occasion for an upgrade in the terrorist alert system.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Florida is where some of the 9/11 terrorists trained
and where the anthrax scare started. If ethnicity was a factor in
Stone's interpretation, let us hope its result was limited to the
surreal mood that must have prevailed in Florida that week, and that
the mood dissipates as the hospital where the three medical students
were going to train sorts things out. The hospital has refused to
allow the men to train there.</TE>
<TE>   More generally, though, let us remember that whether the system
works depends on all of us--that we are the system, insofar as
government can be only as fair, balanced and careful as is the
information we provide it. It has been said that eternal vigilance is
the price of liberty. I pray the converse--that liberty (and
equality) are the price of eternal vigilance--is not true.</TE>

<HD>The End of Deterrence</HD>
<DH>President Bush's 'new' doctrine of preemptive action has
been around for more than a decade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL BRIGHTMAN</AU>
<BD>Carol Brightman is the author of the biography "Writing
Dangerously: Mary McCarthy and Her World," and the editor of "Between
Friends: The Correspondence of Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy."

<DL>WALPOLE, Maine</DL>
<LD>On Friday, in a national security document prepared for Congress,
President Bush described more completely than ever before the
cornerstone of his administration's overhaul of U.S. military
strategy: that is, the strategic doctrine of preemptive action which
underlies his drive to topple the regime in Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   Most Americans learned of this radical departure from traditional
bipartisan policies of deterrence and containment (where you don't
shoot people unless they threaten you directly) when President Bush
told the graduating class at West Point in June that U.S. security
requires "a military ... ready to strike at a moment's notice in any
dark corner of the world," one that will "be ready for preemptive
action when necessary to defend our liberty and ... our lives."</LD>
<LD>   This new first-strike doctrine, however, far from being a response
to Sept. 11, as many suppose, has been around for at least a decade,
ever since defense planners began to toil and trouble over a
post-Cold War strategy where opposing forces could no longer be held
in check by mutually assured destruction and backroom deals between
Moscow and Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The strategy was spelled out for the first time in the "National
Security Guideline" prepared for the Pentagon in 1991 by Paul D.
Wolfowitz and Lewis "Scooter" Libby--today, respectively, Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's No. 2 man and Vice President Dick
Cheney's chief of staff. It was an oddly paranoid document,
considering that the U.S. had just emerged triumphant from a 40-year
contest with the "evil empire." The brand new "unipolar" world, it
seemed, had become infinitely more perilous.</TE>
<TE>   Our allies ("regional hegemons" in the document's lingo) were seen
as "potential competitors" who had to be prevented from "aspiring to
a larger regional or global role" than we assigned them. U.S.
military intervention would become "a constant feature" of world
affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. would "retain preeminent responsibility for addressing
selectively those wrongs which threaten not only our interests, but
those of our allies or friends." A first-strike option, "preemption,"
was designed for potentially hostile states engaged in the
development of weapons of mass destruction--a strategy the president
embraced this year.</TE>
<TE>   One thinks of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's nightmare during the
Vietnam years when he said: "The world is round. Only one-third of
its people are asleep at any one time. The other two-thirds are awake
and causing mischief somewhere." With North Vietnam's diplomatic and
military victories over the United States, Rusk's world really had
slipped its traces. In 1991, however, the U.S. was top banana.</TE>
<TE>   So what explains the projection of force as the solution to every
conflict, even potential conflicts? And the overweening contempt for
dialogue--for "laws and rules and transnational negotiation and
cooperation," which the conservative writer Robert Kagan, in an essay
in "Policy Review," calls the "tactics of the weak"? "[N]ow that the
United States is powerful, it behaves as powerful nations do.... The
'unipolar moment,' " he asserts, "[has] made the United States more
willing to use force abroad."</TE>
<TE>   But surely Kagan, whose United States inhabits a "world where
power is the ultimate determinant of national security and success,"
confuses force with power. As do Wolfowitz and the irrepressible
Richard N. Perle, assistant secretary of Defense under Reagan who now
helps orchestrate the attack-Iraq campaign from his chairs at the
Defense Policy Board and the American Enterprise Institute. "The
string of Perles," insiders call these first-strike spokesmen--who
include William Kristol, co-editor with Kagan of "Present Dangers,"
which argues for the missile defense shield and a massive military
buildup, and New York Times columnist William Safire, who has leaped
into the ring against Brent Scowcroft "and his leave-Saddam-alone
acolytes."</TE>
<TE>   True power, as Machiavelli and Confucius knew, asserts itself
through countless channels, mostly pacific. On this score, Vietnam
taught the U.S. a hard lesson, or tried to. "The amount of violence
at the disposal of any given country," political philosopher Hannah
Arendt noted in 1969, "may soon not be a reliable indication of the
country's strength or a reliable guarantee against destruction by a
substantially smaller and weaker power." She foresaw a "complete
reversal in the relationship between power and violence,
foreshadowing another reversal in the future relationship between
small and great powers."</TE>
<TE>   This reversal is very likely the nightmare that haunts today's
defense ideologues--and the inspiration for the administration's
assertion in its new policy statement that the U.S. must never again
allow its military supremacy to be challenged as it was during the
cold war.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's advisors are not stupid, after all, and must contend with
the legacy of the Vietnam War. The hawks' widespread aversion to
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell (with whom Wolfowitz, then No. 3
man in the Pentagon, quarreled during the Gulf War) is probably
partly because he reminds them of Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, try substituting "Ho Chi Minh" for the "aggressive
despot" in Safire's case for preemptive action against Iraq: "The
need to strike at an aggressive despot before he gains the power to
blackmail us with the horrific weapons he is building ... is apparent
to most Americans."</TE>
<TE>   In Vietnam, the "horrific" weapon was a hard-fought war of
national liberation, materially supported by Moscow and (less so)
Beijing but not controlled by either, and therefore not subject to
Cold War arm-twisting. Once we decided to invade, the U.S. had to
fight essentially on Vietnamese terms, mano a mano, as well as from
our favorite perch in the sky.</TE>
<TE>   "If only we had taken Ho out in 1965, think of the losses we would
have avoided, including the blow to U.S. military prestige." Such,
one imagines, is the intelligent war planner's version of Gen. Curtis
E. LeMay's take on Vietnam: "They have got to draw in their horns and
stop their aggression, or we are going to bomb them back into the
Stone Age!"</TE>
<TE>   Arendt's "complete reversal," meanwhile, is the true portent of
the Sept. 11 attacks, whose perpetrators operated out of a half-dozen
countries, including our own, without being accountable to any
government. This statelessness, together with the ability to turn the
might of U.S. technology itself into terrible weapons against the
U.S., sets Osama bin Laden's network outside the parameters of
conventional international security systems. It's hard to imagine a
"force posture" capable of trapping such chameleons, but if you want
a big bang to divert attention from your failure to cope with the
paradoxical nature of power in the real world, then bomb Iraq.</TE>

<HD>The End of Deterrence</HD>
<DH>The concept of mutually assured destruction kept the peace
for 40 years. Now what?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL KOSS</AU>
<BD>Mitchell Koss is a producer for Channel One News. His
work has appeared on PBS, ABC and MTV.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Our country has seemed pretty belligerent this year. President Bush
decreed an "axis of evil." He loudly pronounced America's right to
bomb preemptively anywhere, anytime, if it's in our interest. And his
escalating rhetoric about a U.S. attack on Iraq hasn't ebbed one bit
since Saddam Hussein began saying he'd allow weapons inspectors in.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps fittingly, as I drink my coffee out on the patio and
contemplate these events, I am sitting over a '50s-era bomb shelter,
a multiroom reinforced concrete labyrinth with vents and hatches that
sits under half of my backyard, a testament to the Cold War
fears--and the wallet--of my home's original owner.</LD>
<LD>   In a way, the country's tough new posture doesn't strike me as
news. Rather, it seems a natural progression of the last dozen years
as we've drifted away from the doctrines of the Cold War into
unfamiliar strategic territory. The old doctrines scared some people
enough to build bomb shelters. But they were at least widely
discussed, which made our government's actions understandable, if not
universally accepted.</LD>
<TE>   Now the president tells us we are abandoning the doctrine of
deterrence. This is happening without public dialogue. Part of this
is a practical problem driven home by the sudden need to deal with
the attacks of Sept. 11. How do we apply deterrence to a group like
Al Qaeda, which has no geography to retaliate against? Part of it is
more elusive. Why doesn't deterrence, a doctrine we were comfortable
applying against the Soviet Union, and currently apply against China,
not apply to Iran, Iraq and North Korea, the three nations in our
president's axis?</TE>
<TE>   In the history of recent centuries, deterrence was a novel
concept. Up until the last half-century, almost every new weapon that
was developed was tried out. For that matter, so were nuclear
weapons. We were willing to use them--against Japan, with horrifying
consequences--so long as there was no other nation that could use
them to retaliate against us.</TE>
<TE>   But once the Soviet Union broke our monopoly in 1949, the concept
changed. Nuclear weapons were then useful more for the threat that
they posed. With the possibility of Armageddon hanging, both the
Soviet Union and the United States more or less restrained
themselves. And we citizens didn't have to think all that much about
the abstract threat of near-instantaneous annihilation. Those who
just couldn't put it out of their minds built bomb shelters, like the
one under my backyard.</TE>
<TE>   When President Reagan proposed his Star Wars defense against
Soviet nuclear weapons, it divided the public. People like me were
against it because we thought it couldn't actually stop hundreds of
Soviet missiles. But many people were relieved to hear a proposed
alternative--however unrealistic--to the inherently ghastly doctrine
of mutually assured destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The world was changing. In March 1989, while on assignment for
PBS' "MacNeil/Lehrer News- Hour," I stood on the steps of Magyar
Televizio in Budapest as 100,000 protesters surrounded it with a list
of demands for more democracy--demands that Hungary's then-communist
government allowed to be broadcast that evening. It seemed inevitable
to me then that the world would soon be a very different place. Eight
months later, the Berlin Wall came down.</TE>
<TE>   That summer I was hired by an august science documentary series to
produce an hour on high-tech U.S. weaponry. It was partly to be a
kind of pornography for nerds, with lots of things flying around
blowing up stuff. For journalistic seriousness, there would be a
question: Can we really control these weapons?</TE>
<TE>   Yet as I researched the film, it seemed to me a bigger issue was
at stake. Like our nuclear forces, these high-tech weapons--designed
to defend West Germany from invasion by the Warsaw Pact--were never
intended for use. NATO's Follow-on Forces Attack doctrine held that
these weapons would answer any invasion by attacking deep behind
front lines with so-called smart conventional weapons. But in the
casualty-averse 1980s, the emphasis was not on fighting but on
scaring off any attack.</TE>
<TE>   Then events overtook us again. Iraq invaded Kuwait. The whole
world got a look at how well American high-tech weapons worked. It
also got a look at the U.S. fear of casualties, when U.S. forces
stopped short of a potentially bloody battle to capture Baghdad and
topple Saddam Hussein--a mission that this year suddenly seems to
have priority. The year of the Gulf War ended with the collapse of
the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   But many people in the so-called military industrial complex were
strangely pensive in their moment of seeming triumph. I remember
having brunch with a source, a nuclear weapons scientist, in
Washington during the winter of 1992. He said to me: "Everyone
criticizes nuclear weapons, Mitch. But I love nuclear weapons. They
kept the peace in Europe for 40 years. Now what?"</TE>
<TE>   As those of us who covered such issues in the early and mid-'90s
soon found out, the fear was that nuclear materials were leaking out
of the former Soviet Union to nations against whom deterrence might
not work. "We call them the Crazy Seven," my source told me, implying
U.S. policymakers feared that leaders in these nations were too
irrational to be deterred. In March 1994, the North Korean nuclear
crisis broke when the Clinton administration could no longer ignore
the possibility that North Korea was manufacturing nuclear
weapons--or according to some in the CIA, had already made them.</TE>
<TE>   Proliferation created a brief boom in plot lines for cheesy Tom
Clancy-style action pictures. But there was little serious discussion
about how we should proceed in this dramatically changed world. The
abstract danger that the world would be destroyed in a nuclear
Armageddon had been replaced by the more easily imagined likelihood
that one or two bombs would eventually go off somewhere. And if the
nations trying to get these weapons were deemed too irrational or
unstable for deterrence to apply to them, then they had to be
stopped. The problem was how, because the logical alternative to
deterrence is fighting.</TE>
<TE>   What kept things in check at first was fear of casualties. At the
end of his administration, the first President Bush sent U.S. troops
to Somalia. President Clinton pulled them out when 18 were killed in
one day. And that set the tone of the decade: The U.S. military could
be used anywhere in the world on any sort of assignment--unless it
would result in American casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Against this backdrop, in a late-'90s world where India and
Pakistan were testing nuclear weapons and North Korea was sending
test missiles over Japan, Star Wars came back as National Missile
Defense. But defense was only half the response to our undeclared
abandonment of deterrence. The other part, offense, was still held in
check by U.S. policymakers--as evidenced in the 77-day war in Kosovo,
fought by announcing in advance that U.S. casualties were
unacceptable. Opinion polls showed that the administration seemed to
fear casualties more than the public did.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2001, a colleague and I were invited to the classified
side of the Department of Energy to address a national security panel
on the topic "Public Perceptions of Deterrence." The assembled
generals and admirals and nuclear weapons physicists wanted to know
from us why the media were not covering the great strategic changes
underway. Where was the public debate, or even consciousness of what
was happening?</TE>
<TE>   We told the generals and physicists that if they wanted more press
coverage, some of them would have to publicly speak about what was
going on. But, as it turned out, we were again overtaken by events.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not Sept. 11 changed the public's tolerance for
American military casualties, it changed politicians' perceptions of
that tolerance. With the fear gone, and no commonly accepted
alternative to deterrence in place, the natural drift is to attack.
And that's the direction that the talk, at least, has been heading,
with Bush stating that we must "be ready for preemptive action when
necessary."</TE>
<TE>   That's a pretty definitive renunciation of deterrence. And
although it had been discussed around the policy table for more than
a decade, it caught most of us by surprise--which is the most
troubling aspect of it, given that in our society major issues are
supposed to be widely discussed. It's easy to blame the media for
this omission. After all, an interview with Defense Policy Board
Chairman Richard N. Perle, lead theorist of the "no deterrence"
doctrine, doesn't easily fit into a Barbara Walters pre-Oscar
special. But finally, it's up to all of us. Do we agree that
preemptive attacks are the best way to deal with the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction?</TE>
<TE>   Whether this new approach will have wider success isn't yet
knowable. It is a doctrine, after all--an article of faith. We may
have good reasons for what we decide to commonly believe, but in the
end it cannot be proved. Previously, under deterrence, and so far, in
this new place beyond deterrence, no nuclear weapons have been used
against people. With luck, whatever doctrine we settle on, my bomb
shelter won't be much help to anyone.</TE>

<AU>JOEL KOTKIN</AU>
<BD>Joel Kotkin, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a
senior fellow with the Davenport Institute of Public Policy at
Pepperdine University and the Milken Institute. He is co-author, with
Thomas Tseng, of "Rewarding Ambition: Latinos, Housing and the Future
of California."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For generations, California's special allure has rested on the notion
that nonnatives, or at least their children, can work their way into
the state's middle class. At the core of this aspiration is
homeownership. Yet today, this promise is threatened as never before.
The problem is not that the state's upwardly mobile first and second
generations of immigrants, roughly half of whom are Latinos, are not
hard-working or ambitious enough. Rather, they are entering a housing
marketplace incapable of meeting their demands at reasonable prices.</LD>
<LD>   There are many causes of upwardly spiraling housing costs in
California, among them the state's tax regime and various
environmental and liability laws. But the effect is the same: Not
enough houses are being built to ensure affordability. If not
corrected, Latinos, the fastest-growing segment of the state's
population, may become the first major group to be denied, through no
fault of their own, ownership of a piece of the California dream.</LD>
<LD>   Today, homeownership in California, at 56%, is the second lowest
in the country, behind New York. In contrast, the overall U.S.
homeownership rate, driven by historically low mortgage interest
rates, has soared to an all-time high, 68%. While the rate rose 4.2%
in the rest of the nation during the 1990s, it increased only 2.2% in
California.</LD>
<TE>   Latinos, particularly immigrants, have been most powerfully
affected by this trend. Between 1970 and 2000, the percentage of
home-owning Latino households in California dropped from 49% to 41%.</TE>
<TE>   The decline is not caused by a lack of significant income gains
for Latinos. Nationally, a median of 71% of Latino homeowners' net
worth is in home equity, compared with 57% among African Americans
and 40% for Anglos. Moreover, most Latino renters want to buy a home
and, according to a recent survey, believe they will be able to in
the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, increasingly, their ambitions seem more likely to be
frustrated. Nine of the 10 least affordable metropolitan areas in the
country are in California. The state is home to 16 of the 20 least
affordable metro areas. In the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the
homeownership rate, 49%, is second lowest behind the New York City
area among all metropolitan areas in the country. In the city of Los
Angeles, the rate is a meager 39%.</TE>
<TE>   This situation threatens both the future of the state's economy
and the durability of its social order. To have a large, work-and
family-oriented population consigned to a kind of permanent
landlessness makes a mockery of the promise of homeownership embedded
in the California dream: If you put in a 40-or 60-hour workweek, you,
or at least your children, will someday own a piece of the community
that is your adopted home.</TE>
<TE>   The failure to deliver on this promise is not just an issue for
working-class or immigrant Latinos. Homeownership makes neighborhoods
more stable and connected. Homeowners, according to a recent Harvard
University report, are more likely to participate in volunteer and
political organizations, as well as stay in their areas longer,
thereby helping to promote social stability.</TE>
<TE>   The state's housing shortfall is not a civil rights problem.
Discrimination may contribute to the problem, but it is fundamentally
rooted in economics--more specifically, in the changing dynamics of
the state's housing market. Simply put, housing production in
California has not kept pace with the state's remarkable surge in
economic and population growth.</TE>
<TE>   The key difference between the 1990s boom in California and
previous ones has been the lack of new housing construction. During
the 1990s, housing production was less than half that in the 1980s.
Today, despite a much larger population and strong demand, annual
housing construction is less than 150,000 units a year, half the peak
rate of 1986 and more than 50,000 fewer than in the 1970s, when the
state population was about 10 million fewer.</TE>
<TE>   Things are not likely to get better soon. Judging by the current
rates of new permits, the state housing shortfall will exceed as many
as 1 million units. Inventory levels for new homes already are at
near-record lows statewide. Not surprisingly, prices are escalating,
particularly in areas that serve largely Latino working-class
consumers--such as Bell, Paramount, Lancaster and Pomona. Home prices
in these communities in 2001 rose by as much as 20%. Ironically, as
immigrant incomes rise, competition for housing will increase,
pushing prices still higher.</TE>
<TE>   All the signals from Sacramento compound the housing problem. Some
of the blame lies with strict environmental laws, the ability of
local anti-development groups to stand in the way of even the most
thought-out projects, and mounting litigation concerns over new
construction. Legislative action to rein in environmentalist
activists and trial lawyers would help remove a few of the obstacles
to more housing construction.</TE>
<TE>   It is also critical to change the state's current tax structure,
which is largely a product of Proposition 13. With their take from
property taxes limited, communities have few incentives to encourage
housing construction, which brings increased costs for essential
services such as fire, police and schools. They instead strive to
attract retail development, which produces sales tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Where new and varied housing could be built close to retail and
business centers to create "urban villages," too much of settled
California tolerates vacant lots, redundant malls and abandoned
factories. What housing gets built is largely for the affluent, or
located on the suburban periphery away from jobs or shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there is little urgency, either at the state or
local level, to fix the problem. This may be good news for
speculators and property owners, but it is bad news for California
and its burgeoning Latino population, particularly new immigrants and
their children.</TE>
<TE>   Where will the political pressure to change this situation come
from? To date, Latinos' growing political clout has not produced
changes in state or local policies that would provide new incentives
for home builders. To a large extent, the Democratic-dominated
political establishment, including Latino elected officials, seems
more focused on building taxpayer-funded, low-cost rental housing.</TE>
<TE>   These officials also seem reluctant to challenge their traditional
allies and benefactors among affluent liberals and trial lawyers, who
tend to be the driving forces behind zoning, environmental and other
restrictions that limit new housing construction. Organized labor is
traditionally a powerful advocate for growth-oriented policies, but
the dominance of public-sector unions lessens the influence of
building trades and other beneficiaries of housing growth within the
union movement, a key constituency in Latino California.</TE>
<TE>   The consequences of inaction are disturbingly clear: a growing gap
between an expanding class of propertyless working-class immigrants,
mostly Latino, and mainly Anglo property owners. This may empower
demagogues of left and right, but it won't be good for the future of
California as a place where ambition is rewarded.</TE>

<KH>IRAQ STRATEGY</KH>
<HD>To Win U.N. Help, Play by U.N. Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE NOSSEL</AU>
<BD>Suzanne Nossel was a senior advisor at the U.S. Mission
to the United Nations from 1999 to 2001.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Now that President Bush has enlisted the United Nations in his quest
to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, his administration must
maneuver skillfully to ensure the organization's support. Rather than
ridicule Hussein's surprise decision to allow weapons inspectors back
into his country, the U.S. should move quickly to solidify Security
Council votes for swift and forceful U.N.-backed action if, as the
president predicts, Iraq ultimately doesn't cooperate fully.</LD>
<LD>   The administration has the wherewithal to build a solid U.N.-based
coalition on Iraq, but the 190-member organization has always posed a
tough diplomatic challenge for the U.S. Its members inevitably seek
ways to tie down the Gulliver in their midst. The U.S., in turn,
chafes at such perceived encroachments on its sovereignty and
criticizes the U.N. for its inefficiency.</LD>
<LD>   But this dynamic has been broken before. The U.S. marshaled the
organization's wily membership to side with its Gulf War plans after
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. More recently, U.N. members agreed to a
cut in the dues the U.S. pays the world body. To do it again, the
administration needs to follow a few simple rules, even if that means
some extra patience, modesty and tolerance for other nations'
agendas.</LD>
<TE>   Every U.N. member knows that America's military, economic and
political power makes it indispensable to the world body and that
U.S. stances shape the U.N.'s priorities, image and ability to
achieve its goals. At the same time, no country wants to be seen as
meekly falling in line behind a U.S. diktat.</TE>
<TE>   When Bush announced his intention to work through the U.N. to
handle the Iraq problem, expressions of relief were heard around the
world. Although foreign ministers called for a comprehensive debate
in the Security Council, they privately knew that the process of
crafting a new U.N. resolution on Iraq would give the rest of the
world an opportunity to shift gracefully toward supporting the U.S.
stance on their own terms. But the U.S. now needs to let U.N. members
get there.</TE>
<TE>   To sustain the positive momentum it created by approaching the
U.N., the U.S. must convey the impression that it is sincerely
considering the views of others. France, Russia and China, all
permanent members of the Security Council, are proud and powerful
countries that need to preserve their sense of independence and
self-respect even as they slowly come around to letting the U.S. get
its way on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Daily admonitions by the president that the U.N. will be doomed to
irrelevancy if it does not accept every last detail of an American
plan on Iraq only undermine U.S. efforts to build support. Public
threats and insults remind everyone of what they like least about the
world's sole superpower.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Hussein has offered to readmit weapons inspectors, the
U.S. will be unable to persuade U.N. members to spurn his offer. If
our bottom line is an attack on Iraq no later than January or
February 2003 because of desert weather conditions, we should instead
insist on a timeline that would meet this deadline if Baghdad
interferes with the weapons inspections. Administration officials
should be mindful that for many countries, the only thing worse than
capitulating to the U.S. is to do it publicly. Accordingly, while
formal debates in the Security Council are important, the bulk of
diplomatic resources should be directed to one-on-one talks between
the president and his counterparts in key capitals. For every U.S.
diplomat in the conference room, 10 should be working the corridors.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, the U.S. should put forth hard evidence to support its
allegations against Iraq. The U.S. rallied the world to its side
during the Cuban missile crisis when it dramatically unveiled, during
a Security Council session, photos of Russian missile bases in Cuba.
Rather than simply dismiss Iraq's invitation to weapons inspectors as
a ploy, the U.S. should be prepared to demonstrate that Baghdad's
cooperation is incomplete, providing U.N. members with facts and
arguments they can use to persuade skeptics back home.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing that the U.S. will rejoin UNESCO--the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization--Bush showed a
mature awareness that the U.S. relationship with the world body is a
two-way street, and that we must respect what others expect of us and
want from us. At the same time, by speaking only about Iraq in his
speech to the General Assembly, the president made clear that the
U.S. has only one true agenda at the U.N. today. To other countries,
AIDS, hunger and economic development are do-or-die problems that
matter as much as Iraq does to us. If we expand our leadership role
at the U.N. to include these issues, we will significantly shore up
our support on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the U.S. must remember that the United Nations is a
membership organization. As powerful as we are, we cannot dictate
everything. The organization has moved faster than many thought
possible in putting Iraq at the top of its agenda. Now that Iraq has
accepted the return of weapons inspectors, that pace will be hard to
sustain. Yet, if we are clear on what we need and willing to
compromise on what we don't, other nations will come around to making
what began as a unilateral U.S. initiative into a global priority.</TE>

<KH>BIOTERRORISM</KH>
<HD>Anthrax Attacks Pushed Open an Ominous Door</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HATCH ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>Barbara Hatch Rosenberg, a research professor of
molecular biology at State University of New York at Purchase, chairs
the Federation of American Scientists Working Group on Biological
Weapons.</BD>
<DL>PURCHASE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>On this first anniversary of the anthrax attacks, a number of
conclusions can be drawn even without an arrest by the FBI. First,
the strain and properties of the weaponized anthrax found in the
letters show that it originated within the U.S. biodefense program,
where the necessary expertise and access are found. Government
officials recognized that the anthrax source was domestic less than
two weeks after they learned of the letters, and nothing in their
investigation has led them to say otherwise since.</LD>
<LD>   One can also conclude that, given the origin of the anthrax and
the warnings contained in the letters, the perpetrator's motive was
not to kill but rather to raise public fear and thereby spur Congress
to increase spending on biodefense. In this, the attacks have been
phenomenally successful.</LD>
<TE>   Paradoxically, however, by breaking the taboo on using biological
weapons, the attacks have engendered a threat that could dwarf Sept.
11. Modes of successful attack and public responses have now been
demonstrated for the instruction of future terrorists. What's more,
it seems to have been easy to hide incriminating evidence, and, after
a whole year of FBI bumbling, it looks likely that the attacker will
get away with the crime. Although the death toll was relatively low,
the strikes crippled business, government and postal services.
Contamination in buildings has proved difficult, costly and
time-consuming to remove, with some facilities still not restored;
the public health system was strained beyond capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Although biodefense has gotten a shot in the arm, it is important
to understand that the goal of defending against bioweapons is not
primarily public protection--which is largely impossible, as last
year's attacks demonstrated. It is rather "to allow the military
forces of the United States to survive and successfully complete
their operational missions ... in battlespace environments
contaminated with chemical or biological warfare agents," according
to the annual report of the Department of Defense's Chemical and
Biological Defense Program.</TE>
<TE>   Biological weapons are preeminently anti-population weapons. But
it would be impossible to provide the entire country with protective
suits, masks, detectors, shelters, training and vaccinations against
the large and growing array of potential agents. In any event,
vaccinations can have serious side effects and can be overcome if the
dose of the pathogenic agent is large or if the agent has been
engineered to evade the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of protection, the civil defense response is entirely
concerned with limiting the damage should an attack occur. There are
also paradoxes here. Because of the rush to "do something," large
amounts of government money are being thrown, without sufficient
forethought, at research involving potential biological weapons
agents. Scientists go where the money is, and we're now seeing a
crowd of biologists lacking in relevant experience trooping to the
trough.</TE>
<TE>   The number of research laboratories and personnel handling
dangerous pathogens is about to mushroom, making oversight and
adequate safety and security control much more difficult to
impose--particularly with the increased emphasis on secrecy.
Ultimately, the very problem that made the anthrax attacks possible
will be magnified.</TE>
<TE>   One can confidently expect the U.S. to squander resources that
could far better be used to extend the modest improvements being made
in the public health system. Natural outbreaks of disease, including
rapidly emerging new diseases for which we are unprepared, are a far
more likely hazard for most people. Improving the public health
system's ability to respond would help combat these diseases as well
as biological attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The anthrax probe has disclosed an astounding degree of
irresponsibility and lack of security at Ft. Detrick, Md., home to
the nation's premier existing biodefense laboratory. The problems
stretch back for decades and extend beyond the anthrax attacks. In
spite of a security crackdown there following the attacks, two
incidents have occurred this year at Ft. Detrick in which spores
escaped from a high-containment laboratory and were found in
hallways, offices and locker rooms. One case was recognized only when
an unauthorized employee took swabs outside the laboratory to check
for anthrax contamination--something no one had thought of doing
there before.</TE>
<TE>   The anthrax investigation has raised questions about the nature
and value of the work at Ft. Detrick and has brought to light the
granting of security clearance and free access to highly dangerous
biological agents to someone with falsified credentials--very
disturbing whether or not he turns out to be the perpetrator of the
anthrax attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Even more serious concerns have been raised by the discovery of
secret biodefense projects that push against the limits of
international prohibitions. It was recently revealed that an Army
laboratory in Utah has been secretly making weaponized anthrax for
some years. Another secret project involved the construction of
bomblets designed for dispersion of biological agents, although the
Biological Weapons Convention explicitly prohibits developing,
producing or possessing "means of delivery designed to use such
agents or toxins for hostile purposes." Such projects have raised
suspicions abroad that the U.S. continues to develop biological
weapons--suspicions that, even if not true, are likely to spur a new
biological arms race.</TE>
<TE>   Experts agree that a significant bioterror attack today would
require the support of a national program to succeed. But for two
years now, the U.S. has opposed every international effort to monitor
the ban on the development and possession of biological weapons by
states or to strengthen the toothless Biological Weapons Convention
in any way.</TE>
<TE>   The anthrax attacks have not altered that stance. Two weeks ago, I
attended an informal meeting in Geneva where diplomats from six
continents struggled in the face of U.S. intransigence to map out a
joint strategy for combating the global biological threat. The United
States had demanded that a formal Biological Weapons Convention
conference, scheduled to take place during two weeks in November,
should instead disband in one day with only an agreement not to meet
again until 2006. To make sure that the American resolve prevails in
this setting where international consensus is de rigueur, the U.S.
demand was accompanied by an overt threat to disrupt any further
proceedings with accusations that would make productive international
action impossible.</TE>
<TE>   At that Geneva meeting, the assembled diplomats, representing the
political spectrum from our closest allies to declared enemies, were
uniformly frustrated. They find it hard to comprehend why a country
that has just been the victim of bioterrorism should stand in the way
of peaceful efforts supported by all its allies to deter
bioterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   It is surprising how quickly public terror in response to the
anthrax attacks turned to public indifference. But the story isn't
over. The likelihood of bioterrorism is increasing, and the American
public is still the preferred target. Government decisions will be
critical in determining the sequel. The preservation of public health
and safety, like freedom, will now require public vigilance.</TE>

<HD>'Insider/Outsider' in the LAPD Finals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a cop, Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez is a pretty good politician.
Which is one of the reasons he emerged from a crowded field of
candidates to be a finalist for a job he has long groomed himself
for: chief of police in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing against the two other fine men whose names were also put
forward last week by the Police Commission to be considered by Mayor
James K. Hahn for the LAPD's top job--former New York Police
Commissioner William Bratton and former Philadelphia Police
Commissioner John Timoney--but this process is now all about Lopez.</LD>
<LD>   Although he now heads the biggest police department in Ventura
County, and thus qualifies as an "outside" candidate for LAPD chief
along with the other two finalists, Lopez is really the last "inside"
candidate for the job.</LD>
<TE>   By putting Lopez's name on the list of three finalists, the Police
Commission provided political cover for the mayor with two important
constituencies: rank-and-file officers and the city's large and
restive Latino community.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD side of that political equation is easier to summarize.
It is a proud and largely insular organization facing difficult but
necessary change. Having spent 27 years in the LAPD, working his way
from patrolman in the San Fernando Valley to deputy chief downtown
before leaving for Oxnard, Lopez offers some reassurance to the
average L.A. cop that not everything about LAPD's history and culture
will necessarily be cast aside in the rush to reform.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's ties to the Latino community reflect the complex history
of relations between the LAPD and Latinos. Coming largely from a
rural, Catholic culture, Latinos are instinctively respectful of
authority. They often live in poor and crime-ridden neighborhoods, so
they also like having the police around. Yet the LAPD's relationship
with Latinos has been notoriously bad, improving only in the last two
or three decades.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez has been in the forefront of helping bring that improvement
about. From the time he joined the department in 1971, he was active
in the support organization for Latino LAPD officers, the Latin
American Law Enforcement Assn., or La Ley. He mentored younger Latino
officers, which should stand him in good stead now that one-third of
the department's 9,000 officers are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   But the history that should help him more with the community at
large is what Lopez did in the late 1980s, when he was in command at
LAPD's Hollenbeck Division in the heavily Latino Eastside. Lopez, a
native of East Los Angeles, instituted a community policing program
that many within the LAPD still consider a model. It included a
"citizen's police academy" that encouraged young people in the area
to do volunteer work with police and helped diminish the suspicion
with which some young Latinos viewed police officers.</TE>
<TE>   That is typical of Lopez's approach, according to Rudy de Leon, a
retired LAPD captain who mentored Lopez. "He tries to establish a
rapport with everyone he deals with, and uses it to establish a good
working relationship. That's why Art was always so well-liked within
the department."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez has wanted the LAPD's top job since he was a finalist for
the position five years ago, when then-Mayor Richard Riordan made
Bernard Parks chief.</TE>
<TE>   This time around he waged a low-key but effective campaign for the
post, cultivating Latino business and political leaders with ties to
Hahn, such as Bastion Capital Chairman Danny Villanueva, who had
summoned a group of Latino leaders to discuss the new chief's
selection with the mayor. "We never insisted that a Latino had to be
the next chief," Villanueva says. "But we made it clear that the
consensus in the community is, 'We've waited patiently, and it's
about time.' So we insisted on fair and serious consideration for Art
and the other Latino candidates."</TE>
<TE>   But now that the politics of this key appointment is out in the
open, the going could get rougher for Lopez. Although many Latino
activists in Oxnard like him and speak well of his work there, the
city has been torn recently by a series of troubling police
shootings, including three of mentally ill people. That could provide
political fodder for critics and give Hahn an excuse to pass over
Lopez after giving him "fair and serious consideration."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the matter of La Ley, which opted to endorse another
well-regarded Latino, Cmdr. George Gascon of the LAPD Training Group,
for the chief's job. "Nothing against Art," said La Ley President Art
Placencia, a veteran LAPD detective, "but we just felt Gascon was the
best candidate. He's younger and respected in the department."</TE>
<TE>   No doubt it would be easier for La Ley, and the rest of LAPD, if
that new chief turns out to be Art Lopez. But there is a lot more
politics to be played out before that happens.</TE>

<HD>Don't Snicker ... Bill Simon Could Actually Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN STEEL</AU>
<BD>Shawn Steel is chairman of the California Republican
Party.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I predict Bill Simon Jr. will defeat Gray Davis. Such a statement
crashes, Scud-like, directly into the bunker of California's
chattering-class consensus, and the reader may understandably be
tempted to dismiss it as blind partisan cheerleading or just plain
contrariness.</LD>
<LD>   But I think Simon will win based on empirical indicators, not just
partisan hopes. Granted, the Simon campaign thus far has not been a
case study in effectiveness, but the fact that his candidacy has been
administered the last rites almost daily for months, while rudely
refusing to die, counterintuitively suggests Simon will trump the
media prognosticators and win.</LD>
<LD>   Simon has been hammered by a nonstop torrent of negative media
coverage and TV attack ads since the spring. Richard Riordan's
once-formidable candidacy--also characterized as confused and badly
run--imploded under a less severe and sustained pounding. Yet
amazingly, in poll after poll, Simon remains well within striking
distance of Davis.</LD>
<TE>   A Field Poll survey released in July had Simon down just seven
points. Two months later, following Simon's worst month mediawise, he
was still seven points behind Davis. This defies the conventional
rules of politics and is a tribute to Davis' deep, persistent
weakness--a story the media neglect in their obsession with the Simon
campaign's real and imagined missteps.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' unpopularity is no mystery. He inherited a booming economy
and overflowing state coffers, which he has mismanaged into a
sluggish economy and a $24-billion deficit. He failed to deal with
the electricity crisis everyone else saw coming, acting when it was
too late by signing panicky contracts locking us into historically
high electricity rates and burdening us with billions in debt.
Policymaking has become a political Ebay for special interests that
secure favorable decisions that are not so coincidentally timed to
large campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The imperious, intemperate Davis is simply disliked by
Californians--Democrats as well as Republicans and independents.
Davis is banking on the mountain of campaign cash he has squeezed
from every special interest to insulate him from all that and buy him
a second term. But in politics, as in life, money isn't everything--a
lesson Davis imparted to "Checkbook" Al Checchi and Jane Harman in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Since spring, Davis has spent millions attacking Simon on
television, with relatively little impact on Simon's popularity. He's
also spent millions on ads talking about what a great governor he is,
and his popularity rating is worse than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Voters want an alternative to Davis. They overwhelmingly believe
the state is heading in the wrong direction, and they have no reason
to think Davis can or will turn things around.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, events have provided Simon with a fresh start as the
campaign enters its critical final phase.</TE>
<TE>   The groundless fraud verdict--which had been hanging over Simon's
campaign like a nightmare--has been tossed out, depriving Davis of
one of his principal clubs for pummeling Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign has finally made full disclosure of the
candidate's tax returns, putting another distraction behind it. These
developments, combined with Simon's decision to pour $4 million of
his own money into the campaign, will boost fund-raising and ensure
that his campaign can fund a sustained ad campaign in the final
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   And it is those final weeks, when voters will really begin
focusing on the race, that matter most. If Simon can stay on the
offensive and relentlessly remind voters of Davis' miserable record
and the worsened condition of the state, he will close the gap and
win in November.</TE>
<TE>   Many an overconfident incumbent has fumbled away victory to a lean
and hungry challenger. Davis knows this from his own experience,
having defied the predictions of pundits to beat two vastly
better-funded primary opponents and then defeat a much better-funded
Dan Lungren. I'm sure the governor is hoping history doesn't repeat
itself.</TE>

<BD>Jake Tapper is a reporter and commentator in New York
City.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>My fellow Americans, the news from Hyannis Port is not good.</LD>
<LD>   In the last few years, the progeny of America's foremost political
clan, the Kennedys, have fallen far short of their mythic, martyred
forebears, Jack and Bobby.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Robert F. Kennedy's son Max canceled his plans to run
for a Massachusetts congressional seat amid serious questions about
his gray matter. In the last few weeks, two other members of the
Kennedy clan who had entered the political arena were received as
warmly as an imam walking into a rural Georgia Shoney's.</LD>
<TE>   Andrew Cuomo, a Kennedy in-law--whose wife, Kerry, another RFK
offspring, was a stumping staple--dropped out of the New York
Democratic gubernatorial primary when it became clear he could expect
a Riverdance-like stomping.</TE>
<TE>   The toothy Mark Shriver (son of Sargent and Eunice Kennedy
Shriver)--a Maryland state delegate looking for a House seat--stuck
with his race until the end, but he might as well have not bothered;
he lost to a state senator.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, while it's too early to count out Maryland Lt. Gov.
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend (the oldest daughter of RFK) in her
gubernatorial race, two polls released Tuesday show her lagging
behind her opponent, GOP Rep. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., in their race to
run the overwhelmingly Democratic state.</TE>
<TE>   Camelot is kaput.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy remains a liberal pillar
of the Senate. But what can you say about his son, Rep. Patrick J.
Kennedy (D-R.I.)? Well, he's never killed anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Throw in the fatal 1984 drug overdose of RFK son David Kennedy,
the 1991 rape trial of Jean Kennedy Smith son William Kennedy Smith
(he was acquitted), the 1997 teenage baby-sitter scandal of the late
Michael Kennedy (another RFK son) and the recent murder conviction of
Michael Skakel (a cousin of RFK widow Ethel Skakel Kennedy) and it
does suggest that the family DNA is not simply getting watered down:
It's drowning.</TE>
<TE>   That's not so unusual with dynasties, though--take Great Britain's
House of Windsor. No doubt King Edward VII would look at
great-great-grandson Prince Charles and wince. To say nothing of
Chuck's Tiger Beat-ready--but hardly statesmanlike--sons, William and
Henry. Or former clan member Fergie's Weight Watchers ads.</TE>
<TE>   The main gloaters about the Kennedy brood's collective downfall
are, not surprisingly, conservatives. "The Kennedy mystique--and the
family's four-decade-long winning streak at the polls--is over," the
Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post proclaimed this month.</TE>
<TE>   This schadenfreude from the right is frequently accompanied by a
comparison of the Kennedys to another national political dynasty: la
famille Bush.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that the Bushes are riding high. Father George H.W.
Bush's presidency is being assessed more positively in light of his
successor's foibles. His son, George W., of course, has stellar
national approval ratings. Down in Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush stands to
be reelected this November.</TE>
<TE>   George, George and Jeb: You can imagine a happy Thanksgiving table
compared with what promises to be a Chivas-addled silence up in Cape
Cod.</TE>
<TE>   But hold on a sec! The comparison is not particularly fair. The
president, after all, is from Generation III of the Bush dynasty,
whereas these new Kennedys are Generation IV. There's a real
difference. And as with Xeroxes, between the third and fourth
generation lies disaster.</TE>
<TE>   The first Bush in the chain was George H.W. Bush's father, W. and
Jeb Bush's grandfather, Connecticut Sen. Prescott Bush. The first
Kennedys in the chain were John F. Kennedy's grandfathers--Rep. and
Boston Mayor John F. Fitzgerald, a.k.a. "Honey Fitz," father of Rose;
and one of his biggest rivals, a ward boss and the state senator from
East Boston, Patrick J. Kennedy--father of Ambassador Joseph P.
Kennedy Sr., grandfather of JFK et al.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the real comparison should be the current lineage of Kennedys
with the up-and-coming Bush brood.</TE>
<TE>   And that means those fabulous Bush twins, Jenna and Barbara, who
have had several run-ins with the law over booze and their underage
possession of it. And Jeb's son Jebby, who in October 2000 was caught
in flagrante delicto in a car in a Florida mall parking lot by a
Tallahassee cop. Jeb's other salsa-sexy son, George P., was written
up in a 1994, police report for showing up at 4 a.m. at the Miami
home of a former girlfriend, breaking into her house, arguing with
her father and later "causing damage to the lawn" with his Ford
Explorer.</TE>
<TE>   And lest we forget: Noelle Bush, Jeb's daughter, who is under
investigation by Orlando, Fla., police on suspicion of having crack
cocaine in her possession --while in court-ordered rehab. You know a
political dynasty is in trouble when the younger generation's
brightest light--in this case, fashion model and presidential niece
Lauren Bush--is best known for how she looks in a bathing suit.</TE>
<TE>   It's these Bushes with whom the current crop of Kennedys must be
compared.</TE>
<TE>   When these Bushes, B4, run for office--and God willing, they
will--we'll see how well they do compared to K4.</TE>
<TE>   By then, of course, we'll also be able to compare them with the
third-generation political dynasty waiting breathlessly in the
wings--Kristin, Sarah, Karenna and Albert III--the Gores.</TE>
<TE>   God bless America. Good thing we left England and that monarchy
thing long behind us.</TE>

<HD>Manuscript Collector Thrills to Discoveries</HD>
<DH>History: Norwegian's 12,500-piece collection spans 5,000
years and includes parts of Dead Sea Scrolls. Now 62, he began his
hobby at 15.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG MELLGREN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>OSLO</DL>
<LD>When Martin Schoyen was 15, he spotted some old books for sale at a
Sunday market in Florence, Italy.</LD>
<LD>   The young Norwegian bought one, from 1592, for about 3 cents.</LD>
<LD>   So began a passion that, 47 years later, has resulted in one of
the world's largest collections of ancient manuscripts, with an
estimated value of up to $105 million.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the excitement of finding that these things exist," said
Schoyen, 62. He added that everything was legally obtained.</TE>
<TE>   The 12,500-piece collection spans five millenniums. It includes
parts of the Dead Sea Scrolls, an ancient Buddhist writing rescued
from the Taliban, ancient symbols used by Australia's Aborigines and
a signet ring used by Egypt's King Tutankhamen.</TE>
<TE>   Schoyen is considering selling the collection, although he is not
actively marketing it. If sold, all revenues would go into his
Schoyen Human Rights Foundation to support free speech, human rights
and development aid.</TE>
<TE>   Norway may be a potential buyer. But the government has remained
noncommittal amid a spirited debate over whether such a purchase
would be appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents such as national librarian Bendik Rugaas say the
government should leap at the chance, while skeptics like Sissel
Nilsen, director of the National Library's Oslo division, question
the nation's will to care for the treasures it already has.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt's ambassador, Nermine Mourad, is among those who want proof
that Schoyen's treasures are his to sell because "if any were
obtained illegally, this has to be settled."</TE>
<TE>   Many researchers are delighted by his costly hobby since
everything is available for study and publication. Much also is on
loan to institutions and museums.</TE>
<TE>   Schoyen, an engineer who built his fortune from a bus company
inherited from his father, is currently cruising the globe aboard The
World, a new Norwegian-built luxury condominium ship on which he owns
a vacation home.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail interview from the ship, he recalled the excitement
of that first book, bought during a summer vacation with his parents.</TE>
<TE>   The work, "Manuale del Navarro," was interesting enough. But it
was what Schoyen found inside the binding that really piqued his
interest: a handwritten religious sermon in French from around 1300.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has collected at auctions, through dealers and by
bullheaded detective work.</TE>
<TE>   For example, obtaining fragments from the Dead Sea Scrolls, the
priceless Jewish history believed written between 250 B.C. and A.D.
70, seemed hopeless. The more than 15,000 documents, found in the
1940s and 1950s in a cave near Jericho on the West Bank, were held by
institutions, with none -- experts believed -- in private hands.</TE>
<TE>   Schoyen recalled that two American students, John C. Trever and
William Brownlee, were the first Westerners to see, study and
photograph the scrolls in 1947 and speculated they may have received
fragments from the owner -- Syrian orthodox archbishop Athanasius
Samuel of St. Marks monastery in Jerusalem -- as a token for their
work. He tracked the men to California, where they had been
professors at the School of Theology in Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, they both got fragments as gifts, but mostly without any
writing on them, and therefore they gladly parted with them at a
modest price," Schoyen said.</TE>
<TE>   Infrared photography later revealed that some fragments did have
writing, "including the world's oldest MS [manuscript] of the book of
Daniel," Schoyen said.</TE>
<TE>   He also helped rescue ancient Buddhist writings in 1995 after the
Taliban took power in Afghanistan and imposed a harsh form of Islam
that included destroying relics of any other religion. The Buddhist
scrolls -- from the 1st to the 7th centuries -- were found in central
Afghanistan's Bamiyan province in caves near towering Buddhist
statues that the now-ousted Taliban blew up in 2001 as "un-Islamic"
idols.</TE>
<TE>   Schoyen bought smuggled-out scrolls, mostly in fragments, and
funded a rescue effort for the rest. He lent the fragments, on palm
leaves, bark and other materials, to Jens Braarvig, a specialist in
Buddhist writings at the Academy of Science in Oslo, for study.</TE>
<TE>   "These are some of the oldest known Buddhist texts," Braarvig
said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are piecing together about 10,000 fragments like a
puzzle. Braarvig said the scrolls probably originated in India.</TE>
<TE>   A favorite piece?</TE>
<TE>   "Would you ask a mother which of her many children were closest to
her heart?" Schoyen fired back over the Internet.</TE>

<HD>Cultural Gap Strains U.S.-Afghan Relations</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Thumbs-up signs by Americans are seen as insults
by some. Misunderstanding could undermine support for Karzai
government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY GANNON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>TARIN KOT, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>A thumbs-up gesture meant as a friendly greeting by American soldiers
is misconstrued as an insult. Shows of force meant to intimidate
Taliban and Al Qaeda fugitives frighten friends too.</LD>
<LD>   A cultural gap, more than politics, seems to be playing a large
role in the cooling of relations between U.S. troops and the Afghans
who welcomed them as liberators. Some former friends say it's time
for the Americans to go.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't know why they stay here. They should go," said Ghulam
Distigar, guard at the Uruzgan provincial governor's residence.</LD>
<TE>   If frictions continue, that could make the job of hunting Al Qaeda
and Taliban more dangerous because U.S. troops rely heavily on
Afghans for information and help.</TE>
<TE>   Discontent over the U.S. presence could also undermine support for
President Hamid Karzai's government because it is closely identified
with the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Akhter Mohammed, head of security at the governor's residence,
slapped his chest in anger as he demonstrated how American soldiers
reportedly searched Afghan women aboard a bus stopped at a checkpoint
near Tarin Kot.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, Jan Mohammed Khan, stepped in to demand that the
checkpoint be shut down and the Americans complied, Mohammed said.
But anger remains.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the third time there has been a complaint that they
searched our women," Mohammed said. "We are Pashtuns and Muslims. For
us, our women are our honor. We told the governor to stop them, that
Osama [bin Laden] and Mullah [Mohammed] Omar were not hiding under
burkas. Our women are not Al Qaeda ."</TE>
<TE>   At Bagram air base, headquarters of U.S. forces in Afghanistan,
Col. Roger King, a spokesman, said American troops "as a rule" don't
search women unless a female soldier does the checks.</TE>
<TE>   "This sounds like the common stories that are passed among the
populace by our enemies as part of their disinformation campaign,"
King said.</TE>
<TE>   In conservative rural areas, even things that seem innocent to
Americans are seen as affronts.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed and a dozen fellow guards say they were insulted when
American soldiers behind high walls and protected by sandbags made a
thumbs-up gesture.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt so ashamed when they did this," Mohammed said. "Why is he
doing it? What does it mean?"</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed said he has no grudge against U.S. troops. He fought with
Americans against the Taliban and is a firm supporter of Karzai. He
was with U.S. troops in December at Shah Wali Kot, about 30 miles
from Tarin Kot, when a bomb missed its target and killed three
Special Forces soldiers and 25 Afghan allies. "There was dust
everywhere. You couldn't see. It was just a mistake," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the war is won, he says, and the Americans should leave his
region. "There are no Al Qaeda or big Taliban in our province
anymore," he said. "Our security is good and we are in control."</TE>
<TE>   Many people in Uruzgan province are also angry over a July 1
incident in which an AC-130 gunship opened fire on a village wedding
party, reportedly killing 25 people.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Central Command cleared the crew, saying the plane had
been fired on from the ground. Shooting weapons in the air in
celebration is an Afghan custom.</TE>
<TE>   And despite support for Karzai and a long history of enmity toward
the Taliban, many rural Afghans identify more culturally with their
defeated compatriots than their American allies.</TE>
<TE>   Not far from Tarin Kot, nearly 20 graves of fallen Taliban have
become a shrine. They are decorated with charred and twisted metal
salvaged from vehicles hit by U.S. air-to-surface missiles.</TE>
<TE>   "They are martyrs. They died horribly. People say that at night,
light shines from their graves because God is so happy with them,"
said one man, who was afraid to give his name to a Westerner. "We're
not Taliban and we pray for Karzai, but these men who died were good
Muslims."</TE>

<HD>Thailand Jewel May Become Playground for Rich</HD>
<DH>Environment: The government's plans for its second-largest
island cause fears of more unbridled, profit-first development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENIS GRAY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>KOH CHANG, Thailand</DL>
<LD>It's almost like a military operation. First come the reconnaissance
teams: the backpackers. They're followed by the light infantry: the
local tourist operators.</LD>
<LD>   Then the last wave storms ashore: the Thai and international
resort developers.</LD>
<LD>   Just like that, one tropical island after another in Thai waters
has been overrun in the onslaught of the tourism industry. Phuket,
Samui, Phi Phi, Samet -- all these once-idyllic islands have suffered
through unbridled, profit-first development.</LD>
<TE>   Now Thailand's cash-starved government has its eye on the last
large piece of paradise, aiming to transform Koh Chang island into a
theme park for rich foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   "The island would generate huge revenue for the country if it were
fully developed," said Plodprasop Suraswadi, who heads a special body
to oversee this development.</TE>
<TE>   And this time around, the government promises, Koh Chang will be
done right. Set in the Gulf of Thailand 170 miles southeast of
Bangkok, Koh Chang is indeed a jewel. A national park covers about
75% of the island, helping preserve a rich evergreen forest that
clothes hillsides rising from a narrow coastal strip. Beaches,
waterfalls, coral gardens and bird life abound.</TE>
<TE>   A master plan has not yet been completed, but officials are
talking about hotels for guests willing to pay $1,000 a night.
Smaller islands in the Koh Chang archipelago would be set aside for
golf, water sports, jungle safaris and a casino.</TE>
<TE>   Plodprasop says proper infrastructure and zoning, strict
regulations on building and transport -- an electric train is being
held out as a possibility -- and a focus on ecotourism will be given
high priority. An environmental impact assessment is promised.</TE>
<TE>   "However, I cannot guarantee that Koh Chang will not end up like
Phuket, which has been extensively damaged by tourism," he added.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how good the government's intention, Thailand's
freewheeling economic forces are already ahead of the planners.</TE>
<TE>   A feeding frenzy erupted as soon as Prime Minister Thaksin
Shinawatra announced his vision for Koh Chang in October. As prices
soared, speculators and developers scooped up land held by villagers
for generations. Racing to beat new regulations going into effect in
coming months, developers are engaged in soon-to-be forbidden,
already illegal or simply inappropriate activities.</TE>
<TE>   A lagoon is being dredged, mangrove swamps cut down, national
parkland violated. One resort dumps untreated sewage into the sea.
Cookie-cutter bungalows are being hastily marshaled on beaches and
once-forested slopes.</TE>
<TE>   A parliamentary committee is investigating alleged encroachment on
public land by the Aiyapura Resort, the island's most luxurious, as
well as obstruction of its probe by the prime minister's deputy
secretary-general, police Lt. Gen. Preecha Suwannarat. Preecha has
close ties to the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably wishful thinking that Koh Chang will be different.
I see a repetition of Phuket in many ways, but it's going to move
faster here," said Chayant Pholpoke, an environmentalist who monitors
tourism in Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   High-rises have gone up on Phuket's beaches despite regulations
that say buildings can be "no higher than the tops of coconut trees."</TE>
<TE>   On other resort islands, the story is much the same.</TE>
<TE>   Tourists complain about garbage and water pollution on Samui's
once-pristine beaches, and authorities fear water shortages due to
unplanned growth. Samet and Phi Phi, both national parks, have dense
construction, bars and pizza parlors through legal loopholes or
outright violations of park laws.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign to develop remote untouched islands in the Andaman
Sea and the Gulf of Thailand continues.</TE>
<TE>   Koh Chang, Thailand's second-largest island, was "discovered" by
foreign backpackers in the 1980s. Access then was by fishing boat.
There was no electricity, just strips of dirt road and basic
bungalows put up by friendly islanders.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the government Tourism Authority of Thailand expects
400,000 visitors, and by the time Koh Chang becomes a special
administration zone Oct. 1, a broad, paved road should circle the
island. Internet cafes now flourish.</TE>
<TE>   Along with entrepreneurs, migrants from all over Thailand are
flocking in to set up stalls or work in the tourism business. They
could soon outnumber the island's native population of 6,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The development is too fast. The people here are just farmers and
fishermen. They have no business experience. They don't know how to
cope with the smart outsiders," said Wittaya Noppawan, son of a
fisherman who runs a small, simple bungalow resort.</TE>
<TE>   But it is unlikely that brakes will be applied. Tourism is the
shining star in a bleak economy still trying to rebound from the 1997
Asian financial crisis. Government policy is to go all out for
tourist revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Wittaya and other islanders say some have profited from their sale
of land and are pleased to see more cash flowing into Koh Chang.
Other residents, now landless, have squandered their windfalls
through drink, gambling and dubious schemes, and are forced to work
for minimal wages as hotel employees or laborers.</TE>
<TE>   Inhabitants are being consulted about the future of their island,
government officials say. But critics are skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "It's David versus Goliath. Villagers say they don't know what is
happening. They don't know their rights. They are afraid to express
their opinions," said Anita Pleumarom of the Tourism Investigation
and Monitoring Team, a nongovernmental organization.</TE>
<TE>   Anita says Koh Chang's culture is being rapidly eroded just when
plans are being laid to attract "sun-plus" visitors who want
authentic culture with their beach time.</TE>
<TE>   To provide one cultural experience, the Tourism Authority of
Thailand has put money and know-how into Bang Bao, a traditional
fishing village built on stilts in a lovely bay.</TE>
<TE>   One enters the village near the Smile Karaoke bar, then proceeds
along a newly constructed concrete walk that allows easy viewing
inside the living rooms and bedrooms of residents.</TE>
<TE>   One guesthouse resembles a Swiss chalet, while a number of other
houses have been converted into seafood restaurants, where owners
count their gains and relax after lunch, when customers leave.
Nearby, fishermen repair nets under the sweltering sun.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, nobody on the island had any money, but we all helped
each other," Wittaya said. "Now we are separated into those who have
and those who do not have."</TE>

<HD>Fashion Never Sleeps in China</HD>
<DH>Lifestyle: Shanghai residents think nothing of wearing
pajamas in public; it's a way to show they can afford them. Some also
cite the comfort factor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN FACKLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI, China</DL>
<LD>Zhan Chunyong likes nothing better after work than to slip into her
pajamas and head out to do grocery shopping.</LD>
<LD>   On a recent afternoon, the security guard, 42, strolled through a
crowded street market in central Shanghai wearing neatly pressed
white pajamas with blue pinstripes.</LD>
<LD>   Other shoppers wearing pajamas or nightgowns haggled with
fishmongers or looked over the goods at the stalls of vegetable
peddlers.</LD>
<TE>   It's a common sight in China's biggest, most prosperous city: men
and women in public dressed as if in the intimacy of their bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   You can see them in their nightclothes on busy sidewalks, walking
amid business suits as if it were the most natural thing in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   At supermarkets, they shuffle in slippers behind shopping carts.
Some zip by on motor scooters, plaid flannels flapping in the wind.</TE>
<TE>   Shanghaiers say they've been wearing pajamas in public for at
least 10 years, since the economy took off and they could afford to
add sleepwear to wardrobes that consisted of little more than drab
gray and blue Mao suits.</TE>
<TE>   Far from being embarrassed, they say pajamas are more comfortable
than regular clothes -- especially in Shanghai's notoriously hot,
sticky summers -- and easier to wash. They're a luxury and a way to
flaunt new wealth.</TE>
<TE>   "Only people in cities can afford clothes like this. In farming
villages, they still have to wear old work clothes to bed," Zhan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents seem to look on it as a charming local quirk. So do
officials in charge of keeping Shanghai looking smart.</TE>
<TE>   "Some say it's not civilized, but it's just a harmless habit of
the residents," said Zhang Limin, a spokesman for the City
Environment Supervision Office.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the city of 17 million are surprised to hear that people
elsewhere don't parade in public in their pajamas.</TE>
<TE>   "Pajamas look good and feel good. Everyone wears them outside. No
one would laugh," said Wang Hui, 17, a student who wore a pink
nightgown decorated with a smiling kitten face.</TE>
<TE>   She and a friend, dressed in light green pajamas, were stepping
out of a convenience store with canned tea and bags of potato chips.</TE>
<TE>   Wang said she changes out of her school uniform as soon as she
gets home. Her mother and father also put on pajamas. Then they head
out again.</TE>
<TE>   "I have three more summer gowns like this one. I wear a different
one every day," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Li Xiaoling, who owns a shop in central Shanghai that sells
nothing but pajamas, said she can tell someone's social status by a
glance at their sleepwear.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the new professional class might splurge on a $12
pair, with high-quality material and a stylish cut. But most
Shanghaiers still favor pajamas costing $2 to $3.50.</TE>
<TE>   Patterns and styles go in and out of fashion, just like other
clothing. This year, it's bright solids for women and tightly
patterned plaids for men.</TE>
<TE>   "Women always select the most carefully because they need to wear
them shopping," Li said.</TE>
<TE>   Pajamas are even worn to work.</TE>
<TE>   On a nearby street lined with auto garages and shops selling car
parts and tires, Yan Huizhu sits in a sidewalk kiosk selling
newspapers and magazines. She goes about her work in cotton pajamas
decorated with smiling brown bears and the English word "Panda."</TE>
<TE>   Yan, 44, lives across the street and said she often doesn't put on
regular clothes for days at a time. She wears the pajamas she slept
in, changing at night after bathing.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether she feels embarrassed while out and about in her
bedclothes, she laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not embarrassing at all," she said. "People in the city are
all used to it. They even praise and admire you if you have on a nice
pair of pajamas."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are limits. Pajamas aren't welcome in better
restaurants and department stores. "They don't let you enter," Yan
said.</TE>

<HD>Putin Look-Alike Takes the Similarity in Stride</HD>
<DH>Russia: Businessman receives requests for autographs and
other attention from the public. And sometimes he has fun with the
resemblance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SARAH KARUSH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Wherever he goes, Anatoly Gorbunov is greeted by awed gazes, whispers
and requests to take his picture.</LD>
<LD>   It's the kind of treatment well-known to movie stars, but Gorbunov
is just a regular guy -- who happens to bear a striking resemblance
to Russia's most powerful and popular man, President Vladimir Putin.</LD>
<LD>   Gorbunov, a businessman from the southern city of Volgodonsk, is
not related to Putin and has never met the former KGB agent who was
catapulted to the presidency 2 1/2 years ago. But the resemblance
makes people do double takes.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm told I look like him," Gorbunov said in a recent interview in
Moscow. "What can I do? ... It's nature's joke."</TE>
<TE>   Gorbunov and Putin share the same sharp cheekbones, slightly
flared nose and thin brown hair, but the resemblance is far from
total. Gorbunov's sparkling blue eyes and warm grin contrast with
Putin's gray eyes and steely countenance. Putin is also a decade
older than 39-year-old Gorbunov.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Putin's unflagging popularity, Gorbunov's resemblance to
the president garners him requests for autographs rather than pies in
the face. More than halfway through his term, Putin enjoys steadily
high approval ratings, as well as outright adoration in Putin books,
Putin portraits and Putin T-shirts. A new pop song, "I Want Someone
Like Putin," has teenagers swooning over the president's strength and
reliability.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 1999, Gorbunov's appearance went suddenly from
unremarkable to the talk of the town, mirroring Putin's unexpected
rise from the relatively obscure post of chief of the Federal
Security Service to prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after that appointment, Gorbunov and a friend took a vacation
at a resort known to be frequented by government officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We got there and everyone started dropping dishes when we went to
the restaurant," Gorbunov recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Gorbunov, who runs two television channels and several
radio stations in Volgodonsk, has learned to enjoy his stardom.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled strolling with a friend on Moscow's Red Square when a
group of tourists from Siberia began staring at him, trying to figure
out if he really was the president.</TE>
<TE>   Pointing to Russia's most famous church, at the time enveloped in
scaffolding, he said in his best Putin voice: "First we'll finish
with St. Basil's, and then we'll do more repairs on the Kremlin."
That seemed to convince the tourists, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gorbunov has mastered Putin's facial expressions -- the creased
forehead, the stern frown -- as well as his manner of speech, and
puts these skills to work when friends request "a toast from Vladimir
Vladimirovich" on their birthdays.</TE>
<TE>   Last New Year's Eve, he appeared on his television channel with
the president's traditional holiday address, making sure first to put
his watch on his right hand as Putin wears it.</TE>
<TE>   But although he has fun with the attention, Gorbunov concedes that
it can sometimes be a burden, especially when he leaves Volgodonsk,
where he is well-known. Since the incident on Red Square, Gorbunov
says he avoids the center of Moscow, especially if he is dressed in a
suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people smile, some point," he said. "Some say, 'Yo, man!
It's Putin!' That kind of thing is annoying and tiresome."</TE>
<TE>   As for Putin himself, Gorbunov said he supports what he sees as
the president's efforts to "return Russia to its past greatness."</TE>
<TE>   But he said he was dismayed last year when Putin did not speak out
in defense of NTV television, which was swallowed up by the
Kremlin-connected natural gas monopoly. Many observers said NTV, at
the time the country's premier non-state channel, was paying the
price for the critical reporting of its news service.</TE>
<TE>   Gorbunov said NTV's takeover set a bad example for officials in
the regions, where many independent media are at risk. Gorbunov's own
VTV television is in the middle of a drawn-out legal battle with the
Volgodonsk city government.</TE>
<TE>   The vivacious Gorbunov could attract attention without Putin's
help. Besides running a small media empire, he and a friend build
cars from scratch, based on antique models.</TE>
<TE>   Recounting a spin in his most recent construction, he said
passengers on a packed trolley bus craned their necks to see him --
after one boy shouted, "Look at that car Putin came to see us in!"</TE>

<HD>Mom Resolves to Save a Son From Himself</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGIE WAGNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Mary Lou Gordon wasn't able to save her four marriages. Or her first
son. But this son would be different. There was hope for Keith.</LD>
<LD>   He was handsome, artistic, a natural at landscape design. He liked
animals, cooked meals for his mother and tried hard to be a good son.</LD>
<LD>   Mary Lou, now 71, tried hard to be a good mother, always bailing
him out of trouble and trying to get him off drugs.</LD>
<TE>   When he was a boy, his blond hair and eager grin always attracted
attention.</TE>
<TE>   "He was adorable. He was so beautiful. I'd go to the market and
the clerk would say: 'He's too pretty to be a boy.' "</TE>
<TE>   That was long ago. In recent years, he was a shell of the man he
used to be. His teeth were rotting and his good looks had faded. He
was dirty, used up at age 39. Drugs made him say things that he
didn't mean and turned him into a thief and a liar.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Lou lived in fear, never knowing what her son would do.</TE>
<TE>   But she knew what she would do.</TE>
<TE>   She would save him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mary Lou always chose the wrong husbands. They would drink, just
as her father had, and they were often violent.</TE>
<TE>   She had married her first husband to get out of the house where
she grew up in North Hollywood. She didn't love him, but they had
gone to junior high together and she thought that he was nice enough.</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, their blue-eyed, brown-haired son was born, John Carl
Burns Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The marriage ended and Mary Lou met husband No. 2. It was the same
story -- drinking and arguing -- and the couple came to Las Vegas in
1960 to get a quickie divorce.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Lou stayed and bought a small house.</TE>
<TE>   She got a job as a hostess at the old Hacienda hotel-casino and
soon fell in love with a pit boss. They married and, nine months
later in 1963, Keith Fletchall Jr. was born. His father left three
months later.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, it was just the three of them. She worked two jobs, as
a secretary and at a golf course, so she could put Keith in a private
preschool and John in braces. She joined the Mormon church, taught
Sunday school and was a Cub Scout den mother. The boys struggled in
school, so she got them tutors.</TE>
<TE>   She tried marriage No. 4, but it ended after five years.</TE>
<TE>   Keith won perfect-attendance awards and sports honors, and was
president of the weightlifting club. Friends nicknamed him "007"
because he was handsome and liked to imitate James Bond. He spent his
free time working on his faded olive green 1967 Mustang.</TE>
<TE>   Lora Susca, his high school girlfriend, remembers his charm. "He
could schmooze his way into anything."</TE>
<TE>   "Keith was so animated when you met him," said family friend Julie
Gialketsis, who attended junior high and part of high school with
Keith. "And his brother was like a better-looking Dennis Quaid."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Lou's marriages hadn't worked, but her sons were a different
story. She could do this, rear them on her own. Get a good education
and you'll have a nice job, she told them.</TE>
<TE>   But something happened to John.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned from a three-year stint in the Navy after high
school, he was drinking a quart of vodka a day and had turned to
drugs. Mary Lou wrote him a letter when he checked himself into a
rehabilitation center.</TE>
<TE>   "You come from a long line of alcoholics," she wrote, remembering
her father's and grandfather's troubles. "It's the road to
destruction. It's in your genes and you're going to have to really
fight it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, John overdosed on morphine. He was 32. His younger
brother was a pallbearer at the military funeral.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Lou blamed herself, just as she had for the failure of her
marriages.</TE>
<TE>   She told Keith then: "Be careful. Look what can happen to you."</TE>
<TE>   Keith drank and took drugs in high school. But he was just
experimenting. Wasn't he?</TE>
<TE>   His mother told herself that life would be better. Keith was
different. He was the son she spoiled rotten and doted on, always
giving him everything he wanted. Cars, trucks, stereos.</TE>
<TE>   When his brother died, Keith was already running with a fast crowd
in Beverly Hills, where he had moved after graduating from high
school in 1981. He worked various jobs -- landscaping, construction,
security -- and told his mother that he and his friends would drink,
do cocaine and carouse into the early morning.</TE>
<TE>   With Keith gone, Mary Lou decided that she needed a gun. There
might be a break-in and she wanted to be prepared. She took a
shooting course at the North Las Vegas Police Department and bought a
.25-caliber pistol.</TE>
<TE>   Then she got a phone call from Keith. Could he come home? He
needed to dry out.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Lou, knowing that she could save him, of course said yes.</TE>
<TE>   But Keith soon was using cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine. His
new friends were drug dealers and users.</TE>
<TE>   It was happening again. Another son. Another life slipping away.</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't hold a job and had a string of driving problems --
citations and wrecks. His mother made his car payments, paid his
fines and hired an attorney to get drug possession charges dropped.</TE>
<TE>   She wrote him a letter, like the one she had written her first
son. Please get help, she told him.</TE>
<TE>   Years passed and Keith slipped further into addiction. Mornings
were the worst, when he was having withdrawals. He would scream,
throw things and beg for money. Once he took a crowbar to his
mother's car.</TE>
<TE>   Still she'd say that wasn't Keith; it was a monster the drugs had
created.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Lou read books on codependent children and drug addicts. She
went to Al-Anon and Tough Love meetings. She learned that she was an
enabler. She was letting Keith treat her badly.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, she got a restraining order against him and had him
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   But when he was released, how could she turn her son away?</TE>
<TE>   "He'd come back and say, 'I'm hungry,' and I'd let him in."</TE>
<TE>   That's the cycle of codependency. It allows both people to act in
sick ways, says Dr. Lawson Bernstein, a Pittsburgh neuropsychiatrist
and expert in addiction medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "It allows the addict to forgo responsibility for his or her
actions, and it allows the other person to exert some degree of
control over the individual," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way you're ever going to save an addict is to not save
them."</TE>
<TE>   Friends who had seen Mary Lou with a black eye and a bad ankle
told her: Stop helping Keith; kick him out. Those were accidents, she
said; her friends knew better.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like that she'd just been in hell for the last 20 years
... ," Gialketsis said. "She always felt like he was going to start
anew."</TE>
<TE>   Another friend, Joe Beth Cassell, said: "How far do you go to get
involved in other people's business?" She wanted to report Keith for
abuse, but Mary Lou refused.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my own guilt behind this," Cassell said.</TE>
<TE>   Keith kept trying rehabilitation programs -- acupuncture,
counseling, yoga, exercise -- and his mother kept hoping.</TE>
<TE>   But things got worse. Keith became paranoid. He was convinced that
Mary Lou was putting scorpions in his clothes and microphones in the
doorknobs. He ripped the doorknobs off and cut up the clothes with
scissors.</TE>
<TE>   He sold his mother's clothes, shoes, furniture and television for
drugs. He even traded toilet paper.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Lou often spent nights with friends or sat in her car for
hours, afraid to go into her home.</TE>
<TE>   "God, just make him well," she said she prayed.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd cry and say, 'I don't want to be a drug addict because I
know I'm going to burn in hell for what I've done to you,'" she said.</TE>
<TE>   There was a good side to Keith. He called the Humane Society when
he thought that a neighbor's dog was being mistreated. He cooked
dinners for his mother.</TE>
<TE>   He told her that he wanted to try another program. Mary Lou took
him three times to enroll in a Salvation Army drug center, but he
never returned for an evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   On May 31, after Keith pawned the title to his truck for drug
money, he told his mother that he needed $75 to get it back.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'It's over. This is it.' So I wrote a $75 check," she
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The money went for drugs. And the next morning, June 1, he wanted
more.</TE>
<TE>   No, Mary Lou said. She was standing her ground. This time she
meant it. She had no more money. She had written the check against
her Social Security money that wasn't even in the bank yet.</TE>
<TE>   Furious, Keith started breaking furniture, throwing things and
cursing.</TE>
<TE>   She had never seen her son like this. She knew that she needed to
get away from him.</TE>
<TE>   Keith was holding a baseball bat, chasing her down the hall with
it.</TE>
<TE>   She went into her bedroom. Her son followed with the bat.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew when he came at me with a bat, that was it," she said,
sobbing as she recalls the scene. "I really knew he was out of his
mind and going to kill me."</TE>
<TE>   The overnight case on her bed contained the gun that she had
bought years ago. She always kept it loaded.</TE>
<TE>   He started to come toward her with the bat.</TE>
<TE>   She reached in, pulled out the pistol and lifted it.</TE>
<TE>   She fired.</TE>
<TE>   Once. Twice.</TE>
<TE>   Keith fell to the floor at the foot of her bed, shot in the head
and shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Lou's knees buckled and she fell.</TE>
<TE>   It was so fast, a blur. What had she done?</TE>
<TE>   "I heard him gasp. I had to step over his body to call 911."</TE>
<TE>   Her friends were stunned but not completely surprised. As Cassell
said, "I thought he would kill her."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the house she used to share with her son, Mary Lou
repeated that she had tried, and added: "He really did love me. I
always hoped against hope."</TE>
<TE>   Police and prosecutors determined that it was justifiable
homicide. Mary Lou was saving herself.</TE>
<TE>   She is still trying to sort out how she sees it.</TE>
<TE>   Keith was the one she was supposed to save.</TE>

<HD>Shoes Add Spring to Your Step</HD>
<DH>Footwear: Shock- absorbing heel is said to reduce leg, back
and foot pain. Inventor, a runner, was motivated by self-interest and
aging.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE ANN STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE</DL>
<LD>Alvaro Gallegos' feet slammed into the pavement mile after mile in
the predawn darkness. With each stride, he could feel the hard earth
and his own energy colliding in his sneakers -- and, boy, did it
hurt.</LD>
<LD>   Gallegos figured that there was a better way. Now he's president
of Z-Coil Footwear Inc. -- a New Mexico company experiencing enormous
growth.</LD>
<LD>   Z-Coils have reportedly curbed leg, back and foot pain using an
idea that's been around for a hundred years: Put a little spring in
your step.</LD>
<TE>   Gallegos' shoe has a spring built into the heel and a supportive
insole. It may look odd, but customers-turned-stockholders say it's a
life-changing shoe.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't even like to use the word shoe, really," said Jean-Paul
de Jager, Z-Coil's promotions director. "It's footwear. It's really
more of an orthopedic device that deals with injuries and problems."</TE>
<TE>   But don't confuse Z-Coil with the mass-marketed Nike Shox, de
Jager said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nike uses a spring sound on the commercial, but we've cut them
up," he said. "No spring."</TE>
<TE>   Z-Coils are built with an actual steel spring mounted at the heel
with its own platform sole, he said. Its models include sandals,
clogs, hiking boots, work boots and street shoes. Several designs
hide the spring.</TE>
<TE>   But the best seller is still the company's first product, a
sneaker, which retails for about $160 to $170.</TE>
<TE>   On an obstacle course outside the company headquarters in
Albuquerque, customers walk over mismatched planks and cobblestones
with ease.</TE>
<TE>   The springs are designed to absorb the impact of walking and
running, but also work to balance the wearer on uneven surfaces,
preventing twisted ankles, Gallegos said.</TE>
<TE>   The shoes have come a long way since 1989, when he first took a
band saw to a conventional sneaker and glued in a spring. The company
went into business in 1996 after seven years of design and testing.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the company reported $2.5 million in sales from its
network of more than 150 distributors in the United States -- a
growth of about 270% over the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegos' son, Andres, returned to New Mexico from a corporate
marketing job in New Jersey to become vice president. Two of
Gallegos' seven other children also work for the company.</TE>
<TE>   Andres Gallegos, 35, and his father, 71, launched a grass-roots
fund-raising effort that boosted the company from an entrepreneur's
dream to a possible commercial competitor. The kicker is that the
business' success continues to come mostly from word of mouth. Andres
Gallegos said he is often asked how the company can survive on such
low-tech advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy when you've got someone crying in your showroom, and
they go around and tell every single friend and family member, 'You
have to get Z-Coil shoes,' " he said. "... It's like, who would tell
you 150 times that you've got to get a product? It is unheard of."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the investors who put money into the company during three
stock offerings were already customers, the younger Gallegos said,
including podiatrists, chiropractors and surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   Alvaro Gallegos -- who designed the shoes to help him run faster
and farther with less pain as he aged -- believes that Z-Coils could
find a place in the athletic market.</TE>
<TE>   He holds five patents for spring shoes and secured another this
summer for a basketball shoe with a built-in ankle support, a
revolving plate in the sole and, of course, a spring coil in the
heel.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, the company is focusing on the issue that brought it
this far -- pain relief.</TE>
<TE>   "The athletic market is a very big sandbox in which we would be a
very small player," de Jager said. "Right now, we basically have our
own sandbox."</TE>

<HD>Even Holy Water Yields to Drought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>COLLEEN SLEVIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>GOLDEN, Colo.</DL>
<LD>The planters at the grotto at the Mother Cabrini Shrine have no
flowers, just dirt. The nuns are limited to seven-minute showers.
They go to a coin laundry to clean their linens.</LD>
<LD>   And the shrine's main spring -- considered holy by the faithful,
who believe that its water can heal -- is being supplemented with
city water brought in by truck.</LD>
<LD>   Because of the worst drought in a century, conserving water has
become common throughout the West.</LD>
<TE>   But at the shrine, it takes on a loftier purpose. Every year,
about 150,000 people from around the world visit, many just for the
water.</TE>
<TE>   "Because so many people come up to pray for peace and are looking
for a cure for their body, it helps them to be able to take some
water home with them," said the shrine's director, Sister Bernadette
Casciano of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   Mother Frances Cabrini, the United States' first saint, discovered
the shrine's first spring -- the one now regarded as holy -- in 1912
when she bought the property to serve as a summer camp for an
orphanage.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrini, a shrewd businesswoman who founded more than 60 schools,
orphanages and hospitals, got the property at a bargain because no
one believed that water would be found there.</TE>
<TE>   But at a picnic with some girls and nuns, Cabrini is said to have
touched a rock with her cane and asked someone to lift it, thus
uncovering the spring.</TE>
<TE>   For 90 years, three springs have provided water at the shrine,
which features a retreat and 22-foot hilltop statue of Jesus
overlooking Denver, 20 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   The nuns typically rely on two of the three springs for indoor use
and irrigation.</TE>
<TE>   This year, though, drought has slowed the flow at all three
springs. And all three have been pressed into service for everyday
uses.</TE>
<TE>   Small paper cups are provided to pilgrims who want to help
themselves to the holy water. A sign asks people to limit themselves
to one quart each.</TE>
<TE>   Pilgrims must use portable toilets, and the only decorative
flowers nearby are purple plastic ones mixed with real marigolds.</TE>
<TE>   The nuns also serve large retreat groups with paper plates.</TE>
<TE>   The spring water has never been declared holy by the Roman
Catholic Church, but that did not stop Le Hoan, a Vietnamese
hairdresser who lives in Denver from visiting the shrine to pray for
her 4-year-old daughter, who was about to undergo kidney surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Hoan has brought water home to her daughter from previous visits.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in her," Hoan said of Cabrini.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I come here."</TE>
<TE>   Lucia Aguilera of Denver took a bottle to bless her home. She went
picnicking with her husband and two children next to the grotto
before climbing 373 stairs to the statue.</TE>
<TE>   The nuns hope to raise $250,000 to allow the shrine to tap into
city water for everyday uses so that the spring can provide water
just for pilgrims.</TE>
<TE>   Casciano said conserving water fits in with her order's philosophy
of being good stewards of the earth.</TE>
<TE>   But she believes that more people will have to learn to view every
last drop of their water as precious too.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just paving the way," she said.</TE>

<HD>Meth-Making Bandits Target Farmers' Fertilizer</HD>
<DH>Crime: N.Y. authorities are disturbed by the rise in the
theft of anhydrous ammonia, a volatile chemical used on corn and
soybean crops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM KATES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>VENICE CENTER, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Dale Parmley has lost count of how many times that thieves have crept
onto his 1,800-acre farm to rob him. You might think that he was
mining gold instead of growing corn and soybeans.</LD>
<LD>   The bandits are after anhydrous ammonia, a volatile liquid
fertilizer that can be used to produce methamphetamine.</LD>
<LD>   "They've hit my farm as many as three, four times in one week.
They just keep getting more bold," said Parmley, whose farm lies amid
the Finger Lakes in southern Cayuga County, 40 miles southwest of
Syracuse. "They caught one guy at my place. They put him in jail. He
got bailed out. He hit one of my neighbors on the way out of town."</LD>
<TE>   Cayuga County has become part of an illegal pipeline for an
unorganized group of modern-day bootleggers, most of whom run the
fertilizer from New York farms to meth labs in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 18 months, more than 200 anhydrous ammonia thefts have
been reported to Cayuga County sheriff's deputies, said Steve McLoud,
chief investigator. Since July 2001, there have been 32 arrests --
three-fourths of them people from Pennsylvania, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Why New York? Many north-central Pennsylvania farms use other
types of fertilizers. They are also too small to risk storing
ammonia, which comes as a pressurized liquid and requires storage and
application equipment that can cost thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "What's really disturbing to us, though, is that if we are able to
apprehend that many people, how many others are out there doing the
same things that we're not catching?" McLoud said.</TE>
<TE>   The thefts have plagued the Midwest for years, where the use of
meth has spread "like a prairie wildfire" and become rural America's
No. 1 problem, according to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
chief Asa Hutchinson.</TE>
<TE>   According to a DEA survey, the number of people abusing the drug
-- also known as speed, ice, crystal or crank -- has tripled over
five years to 9.4 million in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In Oklahoma, thieves were so persistent that farmers and
fertilizer dealers fought for and helped pass a law that carries a
maximum 15-year prison sentence and $25,000 fine for a person caught
destroying or attempting to destroy any liquid transportation tank.</TE>
<TE>   The thefts in New York so far have been mostly in Cayuga County.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] we have a lot of farmers around the state who grow corn,"
said Chris LaRoe, spokesman for the state Farm Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   LaRoe said New York needs tougher laws. Usually, local authorities
can charge thieves only with burglary or petit larceny, misdemeanors
that often draw penalties of less than a year in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Cayuga County Sheriff James Moochler said he's taking extra
measures and increasing patrols.</TE>
<TE>   "Like many police agencies, our resources are limited," Moochler
said. "These locations are all rural. We have a big county to cover
and it can be difficult. Plus, these people come late at night and
early in the morning, make their grab and take off. They're not
tourists. They don't spend a lot of time here."</TE>
<TE>   The thefts have so overwhelmed local authorities that U.S. Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) has asked the FBI to get involved in
the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The economics are enticing.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers buy anhydrous ammonia for less than $1 a gallon and
typically store thousands of gallons for use at the beginning of the
planting season. Supply wagons are parked overnight in dozens of
dark, remote fields.</TE>
<TE>   "Runners," as thieves are called, can get up to $250 a gallon.
Using coolers, propane tanks and empty soda syrup canisters, they
haul away several gallons at a time.</TE>
<TE>   With one gallon, a meth cook can make a few ounces of the drug,
worth about $2,000. The average homeowner would probably find most of
the ingredients for cooking meth -- lithium batteries, matches, cold
medication and liquid solvents -- in a kitchen junk drawer and
medicine cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   Anhydrous ammonia can be deadly. Federal regulations govern its
use, requiring specific procedures and equipment for handling.
Farmers use it as a fertilizer ingredient and know how to handle it
safely. Some, like Parmley, use tens of thousands of gallons during
planting season, storing it in 30,000-gallon railroad tanker cars and
transporting it to the field in 1,000-gallon "wagon" tanks.</TE>
<TE>   The pressurized liquid can produce more than 200 pounds of
pressure per square inch. It feels like minus 160 degrees on the
skin. It turns into a gas when exposed to air and, although it
evaporates quickly, can cause serious skin and respiratory burns and
even death if exposure is direct or prolonged.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently, the chemical ends up spilled or abandoned by amateurs
who are either reckless or looking to hide evidence, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are dumping their waste in their backyards, along the side
of the road, wherever they feel they need to," said Mark Nemier, a
special agent with the DEA office in Syracuse.</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Donald said it "seems like just about every week" that
thieves hit the 1,300-acre farm he owns with his brother, Robert.</TE>
<TE>   The Donalds have reinforced valve coverings with steel and
installed heavy-duty locks that can't be broken with bolt cutters.
Other farmers have mislabeled their anhydrous ammonia tanks as
propane, installed barbed-wire fencing, and moved their tanks closer
to barns and homes.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing has worked.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just worried that they're going to get greedy and try to
steal a wagon out of a field. That would be real stupid and real
dangerous," Rodney Donald said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, there has been no violence, although several thieves have
been arrested carrying guns and knives. There have been two
high-speed chases with police, and frequent run-ins between
patrolling farmers and noisy thieves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only a matter of time," McLoud said. "I know farmers are
only looking to protect their property. But they don't know who or
what they are dealing with. You never know when one of these guys is
high on the stuff, and if he's armed, a farmer might get hurt. And
I'm just as worried about one of these farmers, in a fit of rage,
injuring or killing a suspect."</TE>
<TE>   Parmley, meanwhile, said he'll stop storing the chemical at his
farm and buy only what he needs when he needs it.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's see them steal what I ain't got," he said.</TE>

<HD>Cowgirl Won't Be Cowed by Aging</HD>
<DH>Lifestyle: Connie Douglas Reeves is nearly 101, but she
refuses to let failing eyesight or fading hearing keep her off a
horse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH HASTINGS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>HUNT, Texas</DL>
<LD>In 1901, while the Wright brothers were trying to fly and Guglielmo
Marconi was trying to get his radio to work, Constance Douglas was
born in a tiny Texas border town, the only child of a district judge
and his genteel wife.</LD>
<LD>   It would never occur to Connie, as she swam in the Rio Grande and
rode horses with cowboys, that other little girls in other places
lived vastly different lives. She was a spirited, willful child and
the world was hers. That it began in Texas and ended in Texas was
just fine with her, and with everyone she knew.</LD>
<LD>   After she grew up and went to college, she became the first woman
to enter the University of Texas Law School. She met Eleanor
Roosevelt. She taught school and horseback riding. She didn't marry
until age 42, becoming a rancher as well as a wife.</LD>
<TE>   It never crossed her mind that she would outlive every person she
ever loved, including Jack, her husband of 40 years. Or that along
the way she would become famous simply by being herself.</TE>
<TE>   Connie Douglas Reeves, at age 100, helped open the National
Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame this summer, sharing the spotlight
with a new inductee, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves was honored because she has taught more than 30,000 girls
to ride Western and English, because she embodies the independent
cowgirl spirit, and because on most days, although she is "hard of
hearing and can't see a thing," she still gets on her horse and
rides.</TE>
<TE>   For the past 66 summers, a significant portion of her life and
heart has been claimed by Camp Waldemar for Girls, an exclusive oasis
straddling the cool, green Guadalupe River in the Texas hill country.</TE>
<TE>   Riding, canoeing, swimming and archery are taught during monthlong
sessions intended to supply 7-to 16-year-olds with something that
Reeves never seemed to lack -- self-possession.</TE>
<TE>   "Always saddle your own horse" has become her life motto and is
repeated almost every time her name is mentioned. They read it during
her Hall of Fame induction. And somehow, it ended up in Liz Smith's
tabloid gossip column, just before a juicy item about Tom Cruise.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember saying that, but they keep saying I did," she
said with a chuckle."I meant really saddle your own horse. You want
to know that your horse is saddled properly. It establishes a good
relationship with the horse."</TE>
<TE>   Now it is part of her folklore, and that's fine with her too.</TE>
<TE>   At first, she didn't think that she belonged in the cowgirl hall
of fame. "I didn't see that I had made much of a contribution," she
said, sitting on the porch of Camp Waldemar's stables, taking refuge
from a merciless Texas sun.</TE>
<TE>   She is wearing a blue oxford-cloth shirt and form-fitting navy
slacks with stitched creases. A black belt, with a silver buckle the
size of a passport, rides her flat stomach. On her tiny feet are
cowboy boots of ancient leather, crinkled like the surface of an old
oil painting.</TE>
<TE>   Her white hair is tightly curled, her lips painted crimson, her
fingernails manicured and lacquered red.</TE>
<TE>   "But they said I taught all those girls, and when you add the fact
that I did all that ranching, I guess I've done enough to contribute
to the Western heritage of life," she said, thoughtfulness creeping
into a voice cracked and high-pitched with age. Her failing eyes are
fixed on the horizon, gloriously blue with clouds of spun cotton.</TE>
<TE>   "Boy, that makes me feel important," she said, smiling, hooking
her thumbs into imaginary suspenders.</TE>
<TE>   In just a few days, the latest collection of 300 campers will
trudge home from Waldemar, little more than an hour's drive northwest
from San Antonio. But on this hot, clear morning, about 20 girls sit
on newly saddled horses, trying not to look terrified.</TE>
<TE>   Riding classes are divided by age and experience. "These are the
absolute babies, the weakest ones, the smallest ones, the timid
ones," she said softly. She means the girls. The same could be said
for their horses.</TE>
<TE>   Then off they all go, single-file behind a college-age instructor,
the girls rigid under white riding helmets, their poky horses
shuffling with long necks slung low.</TE>
<TE>   "That's good, that's good. Keep your heels down," Reeves trills
from the porch. "Just relax!"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, ma'am," the girls chorus over shoulders so tense they're
almost at ear level. Some of the girls shoot wide-eyed looks to each
other that say, "Is she crazy?"</TE>
<TE>   "A horse really can smell fear," Reeves said.</TE>
<TE>   That does not bode well for some of the departing riders.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves is teaching her third generation of campers. At Waldemar,
mothers often sign up daughters at birth, who grow up to enroll their
daughters -- until Reeves recently found herself teaching the
granddaughter of a girl she taught to ride in the 1930s. The cost is
about $2,800 for four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   She is legendary here, as constant as the live oaks and stone camp
buildings. "Did you notice this?" she asked boldly, pointing to a
life-sized statue of her near the entrance. "I'm just a spoiled
brat," she said, grinning.</TE>
<TE>   She has a hitch in her get-along courtesy of her horse, Dr.
Pepper, who got piqued about 16 years ago after having new shoes
nailed into his hooves, and hauled off and kicked her, shattering her
thigh bone.</TE>
<TE>   It is only one of several injuries she's sustained in old age. In
1994, an Arabian gelding named Macho threw her after stumbling into a
hornet's nest, leaving her with a punctured lung, fractured ribs,
broken arm and too many hornet stings to count. That earned her
another spot in local history: She is the oldest Texan to apply for
worker's compensation.</TE>
<TE>   She has suffered macular degeneration for years now, leaving her
unable to see much of anything except vague shapes and foggy colors.
This does not keep her from racing all over camp in an electric golf
cart, sometimes veering off the asphalt path, scattering giggling
teenagers like a grenade in a trout pond.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, honey, how are you?" she croons, waving as she tools by.
"Coming through!"</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, Miss Connie," the girls reply from a safe distance.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure wish I knew who I was talking to," she mutters under her
breath.</TE>
<TE>   She turns 101 on Thursday. She hasn't decided yet how to
celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   Always, she is asked these questions: To what does she attribute
her long life? ("I'm just fortunate.") What is the most significant
historic event she has witnessed? ("Men landing on the moon.") And
what, after all these years, means the most to her? ("Nature.")</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a church-going individual," she said. "My church is in
nature. I can go sit on the banks of the river and watch the water
and feel the wind, and I am closer to God -- or whoever runs the
universe."</TE>
<TE>   Which is why she stays in Texas. "I never wanted to live anywhere
else," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When just a baby, she was propped up on a horse by her mother for
a photographic portrait. "I was sitting on a horse before I could sit
up by myself," she said. This was not necessarily a sign of things to
come, she insists. "I have a baby picture of me sitting on a cow
too," she said, cracking herself up.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 16, her family moved to San Antonio. Her mother, Ada,
who wouldn't go to the grocer's without gloves and hat, wanted her to
study speech. Her father, William Constant, wanted her to study law,
as he had.</TE>
<TE>   She was never able to choose between her parents, so she studied
both.</TE>
<TE>   She was the only woman in law school. One professor made her sit
in front, where he called on her constantly.</TE>
<TE>   "He would say, 'Now, do you understand that point, Miss Douglas?'</TE>
<TE>   "And I'd nod my head and say, 'Yes.'</TE>
<TE>   "And he'd say to the class, 'See, it's an easy point. Anyone can
understand it.' "</TE>
<TE>   When the Depression came, money for lawyers went. Her father had
no work. Reeves took a teaching job. For years, it was her family's
sole income.</TE>
<TE>   When she took a job as counselor for horseback riding at Camp
Waldemar, she met Jack Reeves, a former rodeo star, trick rider and
keeper of the camp's horses.</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, they got hitched. On their 10,000-acre ranch, her
wifely duties included herding and branding cattle, vaccinating and
castrating sheep, birthing sheep and, always, caring for the horses.</TE>
<TE>   Forty years after their wedding, Jack died from Alzheimer's
disease. It was just plain hard watching a proud and strong man
disappear piece by piece. In his place was a sometimes frightened,
sometimes angry stranger.</TE>
<TE>   "He got up one day and started out of the house and I said, 'Jack,
where you going to?'</TE>
<TE>   " 'I forgot to unsaddle my horse.'</TE>
<TE>   " 'Jack, we're in town and you don't have a horse.'</TE>
<TE>   "He snarled. 'You don't know what you're talking about!' "</TE>
<TE>   "It was that kind of thing," she said with a heavy sigh.</TE>
<TE>   "I was relieved when he died. It was no kind of life for him," she
said. That it was no kind of life for her, either, goes unspoken.</TE>
<TE>   She never remarried. She never had children and doesn't regret it.
"And I'm sure glad I don't have grandchildren. The world today, it's
disturbed."</TE>
<TE>   Children approach her with awe, looking deep into her lined face,
reaching tentatively to touch creased, age-spotted hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be awesome to be that old," said 11-year-old
Carol Soules, just back from riding class, a fine sheen of sweat
covering the freckles across her nose.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could have lived when she lived because then I would
have seen all the inventions, like the computer," she said wistfully.
"I think that would be so cool."</TE>
<TE>   The inventions Reeves has seen predate the computer by decades --
the automobile, the radio, phonographs, telephones of the party-line
variety.</TE>
<TE>   Long ago, she made peace with solitude. She has known it as an
only child, as a middle-aged wife riding the fences of her ranch and,
now, as an old woman.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes it seems each week brings a new report of dying friends.
"I do get despondent sometimes," she said shyly. "But I get over it.
Old age is not fun.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband's sister lives in a one-room apartment. She watches TV
all day. When she does her washing, she's tired. When she finishes
eating, she's tired."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, Connie Reeves would like to take the woman -- who is
more than a decade younger -- and shake her.</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of living is that? You have to get out in the world and
look at all the wonderful things."</TE>

<HD>Parasites Favor Big and Juicy Males</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RECER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Male mammals are bigger and juicier targets for parasites than
females, and two Scottish scientists suggest that may be one reason
the males often have shorter life spans.</LD>
<LD>   Kenneth Wilson and Sarah L. Moore of the University of Stirling
say in a study that appeared Friday in the journal Science that males
have a shorter life expectancy in animal species where they are
larger than females, which is the general rule among mammals.</LD>
<LD>   The reason, Wilson said, may be parasites. Parasites of all types
-- from bacteria that invade and cause disease to insects that bite,
chew and suck blood -- tend to favor the larger males. This may cause
the males to age and die more swiftly than females, he said, although
he acknowledged that this conclusion is just educated speculation.</LD>
<TE>   "Simply by being big, you expose yourself to more parasites,"
Wilson said. Bigger animals must eat more, increasing the risk of
swallowing bacteria. Mosquitoes, fleas and ticks can find bigger
animals more easily, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Also, male defenses against disease may be more fragile, Wilson
said, noting that the male hormone testosterone is known to slightly
weaken the immune system.</TE>
<TE>   Animals in the study included rats, mice, monkeys, whales, deer
and monkeys, but not humans.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he could only speculate about whether parasites
explain the difference in the life spans of human men and women.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably the same principles that apply in other mammals set the
scene for what happens in humans," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, life expectancy for females is 79, but only
73 for males, based on 1996 figures.</TE>
<TE>   In an editorial in Science, Ian P.F. Owens of the Imperial College
in London said the gender difference in mammals' life expectancy has
often been blamed on the riskier behavior of males, who often must
fight for mating rights.</TE>
<TE>   He said the study by Wilson and Moore shows that in species where
the males die younger than females, "the males suffer a
disproportionate high rate of parasitism," which is most extreme in
those species where the male-to-male competition is intense.</TE>

<HD>Flirting Goes High-Tech</HD>
<DH>Lifestyle: Suitors send love notes via PDAs, pagers and
cell phones. The practice, popular in Britain, is growing in the
United States.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA IRVINE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On her way home from London, Sara Gartman checked her cell phone and
saw the text message from a friend she'd just left: "if we had met
earlier and u werent leaving ... " read the line he'd tapped in from
his own cell phone.</LD>
<LD>   So much for the old-fashioned love note. In the age of wireless
communication, flirting has gone mobile via such devices as cell
phones and two-way pagers.</LD>
<LD>   "People say things they don't normally say over the phone and
especially in person. I think you're more uninhibited," said Gartman,
a senior at Brandeis University in suburban Boston. She spent last
semester studying in Britain, where text messaging is already wildly
popular.</LD>
<TE>   This high-tech flirting -- often punctuated with smiley-faced and
winking "emoticons" -- has its roots in e-mail and instant messaging,
the private, online conversation done in real time and, most often,
by computer.</TE>
<TE>   As technology improves and expands, however, flirts are
increasingly punching in messages on their cell phone keypads. Still
others use PDAs, personal digital assistants such as Handsprings and
Palm Pilots, to make another kind of PDA -- a public display of
affection.</TE>
<TE>   New Yorker Peter Shankman, 30, has landed more than one date that
way.</TE>
<TE>   It started when he saw a woman on a plane who seemed stressed as
she fiddled with her PDA. Using a function made possible by infrared
light, he beamed the word "smile" from his Handspring to her device.</TE>
<TE>   "She laughed and said, 'Thanks,' -- and I thought, why not keep it
as a regular thing?" said Shankman, who travels often in his role as
CEO of the Geek Factory, a public relations and marketing firm.</TE>
<TE>   Now he stays in touch with his current girlfriend with a two-way
pager, a small hand-held device that allows him to send text messages
to another pager or even to someone's e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, thinking about u," he types in as he waits for flights.
Moments later, his girlfriend replies: "Hey, thinking about u 2."</TE>
<TE>   Short message service -- known as SMS and done via cell phones and
pagers like Shankman's -- is generally limited to 160 characters. So
abbreviations are common in a service that is just now catching on in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   If a British survey is any indication, flirting will soon rank
among Americans' favorite reasons to send text messages.</TE>
<TE>   The survey, commissioned last year by London-based Velocity
Communications, found that just over 40% of those surveyed said yes
when asked, "Have you ever sent a text message to tell someone that
you fancy them?" Among the more popular lines to message: "Fancy a
drink?"</TE>
<TE>   More than 80% of respondents also said they would use text
messaging to stay in touch with someone after a date.</TE>
<TE>   Text messaging is so big in Britain that Web sites dedicated to
SMS poetry -- including love poems -- are popping up.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies, such as CosmicCupid.com, provide services
allowing admirers to remain secret, or message people they don't know
-- one of the few ways to message strangers by cell because you
generally need their phone number to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Still others are even developing "virtual girlfriend/boyfriend"
services that allow cell phone users to exchange text messages with
an imaginary love interest.</TE>
<TE>   The trend toward using cell phones, pagers and PDAs -- common
workplace tools -- for flirting has some a little worried.</TE>
<TE>   Mari Florence, author of "Sex at Work: Attraction, Orientation,
Harassment, Flirtation and Discrimination," says an increasing
penchant for firing off quick messages could make hitting on the
wrong person too tempting.</TE>
<TE>   "There's little hierarchy in the workplace anymore. People work
side by side; the lines are blurred," said Florence, who runs a small
Los Angeles company that publishes pop culture and travel books.</TE>
<TE>   "Now everyone is wired -- everyone can be reached at any given
time," she added. "It definitely blurs the lines even more."</TE>
<TE>   For now, flirting by instant messaging and e-mail remains far more
common among Americans.</TE>
<TE>   That's how Debra Mulkey, a senior at the University of Texas, kept
in touch with her boyfriend in Rhode Island until they broke up.
"Although to be honest, I do my best flirting in person," she joked.</TE>
<TE>   That may be a relief for those who prefer finding dates the
tried-and-true way. But Shankman -- who says he's just as happy when
he meets women through friends or everyday conversation -- makes no
apology.</TE>
<TE>   "Any technology that allows people to communicate is a good
thing," he said. "I'm sure that when the cavemen hit women over the
head, that was a form of flirting.</TE>
<TE>   "Technology has just helped it evolve a bit."</TE>

<HD>Wildlife Reintroduction May Be Species' Last Chance</HD>
<DH>Environment: Return of wolves to Arizona-New Mexico border
has angered ranchers. Other animal-restoration efforts face setbacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAULINE ARRILLAGA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEAVERHEAD, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Mike Miller watched from a rocky bluff as the female went down. The
dart pierced her hip, its sedative seeping into her bloodstream. Half
an hour later, after a pursuit along a canyon wall, the gunner
clipped the male in the neck.</LD>
<LD>   He felt a rush of elation.</LD>
<LD>   The cowboy had ridden to Railroad Canyon in the thick of the Gila
National Forest to watch as the feds swept down in their helicopter
and scooped up the Pipestem wolves, named for a mountain near where
they were first set free.</LD>
<TE>   He had come to celebrate one small victory in his and his
neighbors' war against "el lobo" -- sworn enemy of the cattle rancher
for as long as there have been ranches in the West. He had,
unabashedly, come to gloat.</TE>
<TE>   When the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service first proposed
reintroducing the Mexican gray wolf to the wilderness that connects
Arizona and New Mexico, ranchers warned: Wolves and people cannot
coexist, and wolves and cattle are a lethal combination.</TE>
<TE>   This pair alone, Miller believes, killed 19 calves on the outfit
he manages, although federal officials confirmed only two deaths.
Some calves were too far gone to say whether a wolf was the culprit.</TE>
<TE>   They had come within a stone's throw of his home and his kids,
terrifying his wife. "I can handle the bears and the mountain lions
and the bobcats," Debbie Miller said. "When you see them, they take
off. They're scared of you. These wolves, they're not scared. And
that's what scares me."</TE>
<TE>   So on a quiet spring morning, after months of pursuing the
marauding predators, trappers with the federal wildlife agency
arrived to return them to captivity.</TE>
<TE>   "I was glad it was done with," Mike Miller recalled, although his
relief was short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, a month after the Pipestem pair were removed, nine
more wolves were released in the wilderness straddling the border. At
least 21 roam the pine-studded woods, and an unknown number have been
born in the wild. Others could be freed down the road.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later, this cowboy knows, "el lobo" will be back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is considered their best chance at survival and, sometimes,
their last. When habitat restoration alone won't sustain them, when
there are so few left that the odds of natural recovery are slim,
establishing a new population of animals in the wild becomes the
lifesaving solution for many of the nation's most imperiled species.</TE>
<TE>   "It's emergency-room treatment," said Ed Bangs, who oversees
restoration of the gray wolf to the northern Rocky Mountains. "You've
got a patient that's dying and you want to save their life. You do
everything you can. And then you wheel in the next patient."</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife reintroduction has become an integral part of efforts to
protect and restore endangered species. Without it, the California
condor would likely have vanished from the sky, the black-footed
ferret disappeared from its prairies.</TE>
<TE>   There would be no red wolves in refuges along the coast of North
Carolina, nor gray wolves for tourists to view in Yellowstone
National Park. Because of Bangs' program, that species is recovered
in Idaho, Wyoming and Montana, and could be removed from federal
protection in those states next year.</TE>
<TE>   But success stories are often overshadowed by setbacks. Whether by
gun barrel or bulldozer, man rid the land of these creatures decades
ago, and man remains one of the biggest roadblocks to restoration.</TE>
<TE>   In California, commercial fishermen went to court after sea otters
were found in a prohibited zone where they compete with man for
profitable shellfish. In Delaware, developers challenged restrictions
stemming from a new population of Delmarva fox squirrels.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits also come from the other side -- environmentalists who
insist that the government isn't doing enough to promote or sustain
reestablished species.</TE>
<TE>   Then last year, the government shelved its own plan to reintroduce
grizzlies in Montana and Idaho. Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton
suspended the program after complaints from politicians and ranchers
that the bears would put livestock and people at risk.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so much a biological issue. This whole thing is a social
issue," said Carter Niemeyer, federal wolf recovery coordinator in
Idaho. "We spend most of our time dealing with a concerned public,
sometimes an angry public."</TE>
<TE>   The animals don't always cooperate either.</TE>
<TE>   Managers are considering scrapping a program to establish a second
population of sea otters off the Southern California coast after some
died during relocation and others strayed from the area. Of 140
otters moved in three years, 30 remain. The overall population of
California otters is now in decline.</TE>
<TE>   Programs involving captive animals face additional challenges.
More than two dozen condors raised in zoos had to be removed from the
wild because of adaptation problems such as roosting on the ground
and interacting with people at swimming pools.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-five of the 144 condors released in Arizona and California
since 1992 died, some from lead poisoning after feeding on
bullet-riddled carcasses and others from colliding with power lines.
Managers don't expect to meet their goal of 300 wild condors for at
least another decade. There are 75 now.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a lot to bring it about," condor recovery leader Bruce
Palmer said of reintroduction.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the debate over these programs are two divergent
views of how this puzzle that is our nation fits together. Can we put
the pieces back the way they were, or have new parts created a
landscape that can no longer be altered?</TE>
<TE>   "While we may all have this view of what the 'wild' ought to be,
we don't have it anymore," said Caren Cowan of the New Mexico Cattle
Growers Assn., which sued unsuccessfully to stop the Mexican wolf
program. "There are a lot of people around a lot of roads that
weren't there 50 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't turn back the clock."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There are still old-timers in southwestern New Mexico who remember
when wolves roamed these parts as freely as coyotes and bears. They
tell tales of bloodthirsty predators who could take down a calf like
a rag doll.</TE>
<TE>   And they remember when, in the 1900s, the government came to their
aid and began systematically poisoning wolves and executing other
"pests" seen as economically crippling to farmers and ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   Although the government's position has changed, attitudes have
fluctuated little in this place where stories of "el lobo" pass from
one generation to the next.</TE>
<TE>   "People didn't kill these things out for no reason," said Laura
Schneberger, a third-generation rancher who raises 100 head of Brahma
crossbreeds on 42 square miles of Gila wilderness. She blames wolves
for the death of one cow, although a necropsy was impossible by the
time it was found.</TE>
<TE>   So when the Fish and Wildlife Service proposed reintroducing
captive-raised gray wolves in 1995, ranchers in Arizona and New
Mexico fought back. They held "Stop the Wolf" picnics and distributed
"No Wolves" bumper stickers. They vowed to shoot on sight any wolves
near their livestock. They wrote letters and went to court.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1998, despite protests, the government released the first
11 wolves in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest on the Arizona-New
Mexico border. Within a month, a wolf had been shot by a camper who
said it attacked his dog. Within a year, four more were found shot to
death, a sixth was missing and presumed dead, and the rest were
recaptured.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 74 wolves have been released since the program began.
Twenty-six died, including 10 from gunshots, and 31 were recaptured
because of such problems as livestock depredations or straying from
the management zone. Some of those were re-released.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-one radio-collared animals are now free in the forest,
although managers believe that the numbers are higher because of
wolves that have lost their collars and newborn pups.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, residents have been compensated more than $15,000 for
27 animals that were killed or injured by wolves, including cattle,
horses and dogs. either ranchers nor some environmentalists consider
the program a success.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got bruises on all sides of my body," said Brian Kelly,
program coordinator. "Most of the groups are ... trying to find ways
to work this out. If they're doing that, there's hope."</TE>
<TE>   Another sign of hope: Wild-born litters increased from one in 1998
to as many as eight this year.</TE>
<TE>   "You hear about negative aspects -- wolves being removed or shot
-- but there are wolves out there reproducing.... I see that as a
success," tracker Dan Star said.</TE>
<TE>   But the controversy hasn't cooled. This year, some New Mexico
county commissioners called on the government to allow ranchers to
kill any wolf on their property more than five days after its removal
has been requested.</TE>
<TE>   Wolves are even a campaign issue, with one Republican
congressional candidate in New Mexico arguing that the $1 million
budgeted annually for the wolf program would be better spent on
schools.</TE>
<TE>   And problems with the predators continue.</TE>
<TE>   In August, trackers began intensive monitoring of the pack
released this summer after they showed up at a lodge in eastern
Arizona. Another pack has been killing calves on an Arizona ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, seven pups born to the pair taken from Miller's outfit
were tested to determine if they are hybrids, which would be a
setback for the program. Managers suspect the female mated with a
dog, with the results pending.</TE>
<TE>   The Pipestem pair remain in captivity.</TE>

<HD>Bus Service Grows Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Night-owl bus service is as much a part of the 24/7 scene in big
cities as the graveyard-shift workers who depend on public
transportation to travel to and from work.</LD>
<LD>   So why has it taken so long for Orange County to offer transit
service for riders whose jobs require them to be on the roads when
the vast majority of us are asleep? Orange County Transportation
Authority Chief Executive Art Leahy suspects that the county's
residential heritage is keeping many residents from recognizing the
county's increasingly urban beat, particularly north of the Costa
Mesa Freeway. Many suburbanites assume that everyone has easy access
to cars or is snug in bed by midnight, when OCTA's buses head back to
the garage.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after moving to Santa Ana from Minnesota early in 2001 to
run OCTA, Leahy noticed a constant flow of pedestrian traffic in
heavily urban parts of the county. The Los Angeles native viewed the
foot traffic as an indicator of solid demand for public transit. In
May 2001, Leahy read an article in The Times that described the
growing army of nighttime workers who use bicycles to travel to and
from overnight jobs around the county.</LD>
<TE>   The story chronicled life on the lowest rung of the transportation
ladder for a largely immigrant population that doesn't have easy
access to cars, and because of their schedules, couldn't count upon
public transportation. Many of the bicyclists are dishwashers,
security guards and custodians who don't punch out until well after
the last bus has departed. For many of them, the only alternatives
are walking, riding bicycles or waiting idly for hours until friends
or family members provide a lift.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy then asked OCTA staff to study demand for overnight service.
Projections contained in a subsequent report suggested that as many
as 200,000 additional riders would use Night Owl Service. Last week,
overnight service began on a handful of heavily traveled routes.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA has enjoyed some of the highest ridership increases in the
country in recent years, in part because of the county's constant
population growth. But consistent ridership gains depend upon OCTA
keeping its finger on the pulse of public demand.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of Night Owl routes offers proof that OCTA indeed has
been listening to residents.</TE>

<HD>Shame on Parking Scofflaws</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not generating the media frenzy that UCLA football players did
three years by faking injuries in order to win handicapped parking
placards, but an investigation in Irvine is uncovering an equally
frustrating abuse of handicapped parking spaces by able-bodied
motorists.</LD>
<LD>   The good news is that many of the drivers who are being issued
misdemeanor citations for illegally using handicapped parking spots
are responsible enough to acknowledge their guilt. The bad news is
that many scofflaws immediately try to spin their way out of trouble.
The ugly news is that, based on evidence gathered in recent weeks by
Irvine investigators, as many as one out of three handicap parking
placards is being misused.</LD>
<LD>   With 1.6 million handicapped parking placards outstanding in
California--and no central enforcement agency to police their
use--Irvine's investigation sadly suggests that other cities had best
start monitoring who's pulling into handicapped spaces. Irvine has
handed out nearly 100 misdemeanor citations in just a few weeks--a
sad scene in a city that prides itself on making life easier for the
handicapped.</LD>
<TE>   It shouldn't be surprising that the problem of able-bodied
motorists abusing the familiar blue-and-white placards to score a
convenient parking spot is so widespread. A parking enforcement team
in Los Angeles, one of the few major cities that regularly polices
the use of handicapped placards, yanked more than 2,200 of them
during a three-year period ending in 1999--the same year 11 players
on UCLA's football team generated headlines nationwide for faking
injuries to secure parking placards. Los Angeles' handicapped parking
task force at the time described its efforts to counter widespread
abuse as akin to "putting a thumb in the leaking dike."</TE>
<TE>   Most frustrating are the motorists who offer no excuse other than
their own convenience for taking advantage of a program that serves
such a basic, human purpose. It's not excusable behavior, but one can
at least understand the thought processes of caregivers who begin to
view the parking placards as a minor perk for the considerable hours
spent caring for handicapped relatives.</TE>
<TE>   But excuses offered by motorists who abuse the system are just
that--excuses. A man rushing to a recent David Bowie concert at the
Verizon Amphitheater used a card held by a son with Down syndrome to
score an easy parking spot. A teenager used her dead grandmother's
card to save herself a few steps at a Weezer concert--and when police
caught up with her, insisted that she was the 80-year-old woman named
on the expired card. A woman who was confronted by Irvine officers
became verbally abusive, shouted, "I don't have time for this" and
then threatened officers by backing her car up against them.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine is slapping violators with a $250 parking ticket and up to
$750 in fines. But Irvine should up the ante by temporarily revoking
the driver's licenses of those selfish enough to abuse handicapped
parking permits. Offenders could use the time waiting for buses or
cabs to ponder the value of a few precious minutes gained by
illegally taking a handicapped parking spot.</TE>
<TE>   What these scofflaws are lacking is the sense to recognize that
their "me first" attitude does more than inconvenience another
motorist.</TE>
<TE>   They're missing the point that handicapped spaces aren't a luxury
for those who truly need them.</TE>

<HD>Blowing Smoke</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was the Mission Viejo City Council, teetering on the brink of
being dangerously silly, before pulling itself back from the edge.</LD>
<LD>   The council was considering a total ban on smoking in public
parks. It's already illegal in California to light up on a
playground; this would have pushed smokers off the grounds
altogether.</LD>
<LD>   It's one thing to ban smoking in enclosed areas such as offices,
public buildings and restaurants. A mountain of evidence proves the
dangers of breathing secondhand smoke indoors.</LD>
<TE>   But when it comes to the dangers of sitting 15 feet from a smoker
on a park bench, even the supervisor of Orange County's anti-tobacco
program concedes, "There isn't a whole lot of actual science on
this." Such a ban smacks not of efforts to protect the public but of
a supercilious moral judgment on smokers.</TE>
<TE>   It's open season on smoking these days, with heartening results.
Expanded smoking bans, cigarette taxes and anti-tobacco education
have helped cut California's smoking and lung cancer rates. Orange
County tops the list for living healthfully; a federal survey of 98
metropolitan areas found that 13% of adults here smoke cigarettes,
the lowest rate in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes you have to distinguish between what's politically
popular and fits the mood of the day, and what makes sense and
benefits the public.</TE>
<TE>   The Mission Viejo council cut through the anti-smoking rhetoric
and made that distinction when it softened the proposed smoking law
and took the parks out of it.</TE>
<TE>   What's potentially more dangerous to a person sitting on a park
bench? The smoker across the way or the family happily barbecuing
with charcoal at one of the park's grills? Or maybe the driver of a
diesel car who pulls away from the curb 20 feet away, leaving a
smelly plume of exhaust? What about the dust kicked up by the kids
playing softball? A study published this year by the respected
Journal of the American Medical Assn. found that breathing particles
of soot or dust over a long time greatly increases the risk of dying
of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. That's more evidence
than the anti-smoking activists have.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, under the original Mission Viejo proposal, smokers
could legally puff away as they walked down a public sidewalk.
Strange; if health is the issue here, it's unlikely that walking
behind smokers is less dangerous than sitting across the park from
them.</TE>
<TE>   Selective outdoor smoking bans still might make sense, especially
in crowded places such as outdoor sporting events, dining patios or
in long waiting lines. The issue, though, has to be one of public
health, not public disdain for smokers.</TE>
<TE>   Smoking is an activity worth disliking. But banning something
simply because we dislike it, without evidence that it's hurting us,
is a dangerous step for smokers and nonsmokers alike.</TE>

<LD>Toll roads solve nothing. They are just a way to open land to

<LD>   With the Irvine Co.'s recent gift of 11,000 acres of protected
open space and the demise of the El Toro airport plan, there is even
less need for a new toll road. The Foothill South toll road will be
too expensive to build and too expensive to use. It will not end
congestion on Interstate 5 and will not be convenient to most South

<LD>Re "Irvine Stalks Parking Spot Scofflaws," Sept. 16:</LD>
<LD>   I can relate. Twenty months ago, I had a near-fatal ski accident.
Since then, I have been confined to a wheelchair or crutches. If I
have to go any distance, I am forced to use the wheelchair, and if it
is something I can get to close by--by using these wonderfully close
handicapped parking stalls--I can use my crutches.</LD>
<LD>   Before the accident, I am sure I was among the millions of
Americans who felt put out, unfairly inconvenienced and perhaps even
unreasonably jealous of those who got to use these primo spaces.</LD>
<TE>   Let me tell you, after 20 months, five surgeries and one more
surgery to go in a couple of months, I have learned that these spaces
provide an invaluable accommodation to those who need them.</TE>
<TE>   I only wish for a day when I can again park elsewhere and walk a
long distance to the store that I need to reach.</TE>

<TE>   With both my mother and mother-in-law in their 80s and
handicapped, I was glad to see this story about Irvine's stepped-up
enforcement. Shows that a law is no good unless it's enforced. All
cities should take a lesson from this.</TE>
<TE>   However, there is another issue related to this that does not seem
to draw much attention, nor has it been addressed in any law that I'm
aware of. It is the situation where grocery store shopping carts are
discarded in parking lots without concern for people's property and
convenience.</TE>
<TE>   Most stores and shopping centers have designated places for
placing shopping carts after their use. However, our lazy society
just leaves them wherever it pleases.</TE>

<TE>   Kudos to the Irvine Police Department for the crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   My brother is quadriplegic, confined to a wheelchair, and has a
special apparatus on his hands in order to drive. His van is equipped
so he can commute, despite his physical condition. We have often
found it difficult to get handicapped spaces in our city.</TE>
<TE>   However, while attending the David Bowie concert at Verizon
Amphitheater last August, a friendly police officer wanted to make
sure he had the right to park in a handicapped space and that "his
placard belonged to him," by requesting verification.</TE>
<TE>   Enforcement is appreciated, but ignorance of my brother's obvious
physical impairment in a zealous effort to crack down is a waste of
the officer's time and taxpayers' money.</TE>

<TE>   I guess Irvine must need some extra money, and cracking down on
handicap parking violators is a good way to go about getting some.
Now if the state would just follow suit and reform the handicap
system, we'll be getting somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The state grants handicap placards to anyone who has an infirmity
which "inhibits their mobility." Like what? An ingrown toenail? Old
age? Being overweight?</TE>
<TE>   Handicap parking should be available for those who require the use
of a wheelchair. Period.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to, throw in those who use a cane, crutches or a
walker, but that's it. I'm sick of seeing people park in the handicap
spot and then spend the next two hours walking around the mall.</TE>
<TE>   Reduce the rolls of those eligible for these placards and then
start giving out the tickets. Maybe then the people who really need
these parking spaces will be able to find one available.</TE>

<LD>Re "Schoolwork in the Balance," Sept. 8:</LD>
<LD>   After reading the article by Elizabeth Triana, I began to reflect
upon the family vacations I shared with my parents as well as those
that we share with our children today--those typical of occasions
which Triana referred to as "parent-sponsored truancies."</LD>
<LD>   I considered her points of independent-study contracts not
replacing peer discussion or an unplanned "teachable moment" being
missed or a revelation that results in a personal connection to the
material. Valid as these points may be, is that all there is to a
child's education?</LD>
<TE>   In reality, a wide variety of educational experiences contribute
to a child's knowledge, growth and development. Every day there are
hundreds of children who leave school early to participate in school
sports, clubs and other extracurricular activities. Are these
school-sponsored truancies? I think not.</TE>
<TE>   Learning consists of more than information obtainable in a book or
classroom. The process is ongoing and extends well beyond the four
walls of school. Through extracurricular activities and experiences,
horizons are broadened, curiosities are piqued, perspective is
attained and hopefully a well-balanced child develops into a
well-balanced young adult.</TE>
<TE>   In our increasingly hectic lives of two working parents and
extremely busy schedules, how fortunate some children are to be able
to take a family vacation, enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime or
family-bonding experience.</TE>
<TE>   What better way to build the foundation of a child's life, the
content of his or her character and strengthen family ties than to
share significant moments, even if by happenstance they fall during
the school year?</TE>
<TE>   Do I think that because "surf's up" or "we got fresh powder last
night," it's OK to ditch school? Absolutely not. Are there occasions
when missing school for a special event should be OK? I think so.
Schoolwork in balance, family life in balance; that's what being well
rounded is all about.</TE>

<LD>Re "Let Experts Spend Park Funds," editorial, Sept. 22:</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for making the public aware of the park fund issue. Many
of us are unhappy that since Orange County's bankruptcy in 1994, the
Board of Supervisors has taken several million much-needed dollars
from the park budget to pay back debt.</LD>
<LD>   It was not Harbors, Beaches and Parks that led to the bankruptcy,
so why keep punishing the department and us, the public? We need
parks. More people are moving to Orange County, and they demand and
expect open space and safe recreation opportunities.</LD>
<TE>   Harbors, Beaches and Parks has been a good steward for many years.
It should receive the money from Proposition 12 to undertake repairs
and upgrades so our parks can be safe for all users.</TE>

<LD>Re "In Short, Rail Plan Approved," Sept. 10:</LD>
<LD>   I'd like to thank Orange County transportation leaders for
forgetting that there's life, not to mention commuters, north of the
Santa Ana Freeway. Their revised route for the proposed light rail
line is as idiotic and utterly useless as a train line from Los
Angeles to Honolulu. As it stands now, the rail line would serve only
415,000 residents.</LD>
<LD>   The line would connect with only one of the five transportation
centers that would be included under the previous plan. Among those
was the Anaheim Transportation Center, located within a few miles of
Disneyland, not to mention Edison International Field, the Arrowhead
Pond of Anaheim and the Anaheim Convention Center.</LD>
<TE>   And all this because a few precious Irvine residents don't want
the train running near their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, stop it, I'm getting misty.</TE>
<TE>   John McElligott Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Our Orange County Transportation Authority officials are finally
showing they understand that light-rail public transit must take
people to and from places with high origin and destination traffic
counts to even begin to be successful.</TE>
<TE>   It has taken far too long to get to this point, at a cost of
millions of dollars in studies and outreach programs. Although the
Irvine Transportation Center is a hub for Metrolink and Amtrak and
the Spectrum, it could never have generated sufficient trips to
warrant the cost of light rail service, at least for many, many
years.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine City Hall as an origination/destination point was almost
laughable. UCI and John Wayne Airport together with South Coast Plaza
and major points in Santa Ana finally make the system one that has
viable origin and destination points along its entire route. Now
maybe we can get on with truly determining the viability and
cost-effectiveness of a light-rail system in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Gunther</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I often wonder if the public officials who so vociferously promote
projects like CenterLine have ever used mass transit themselves on a
regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   While living on the East Coast, I commuted to work and school on
just about every form of mass transit available: bus, train, subway,
trolley and light rail. Since moving to California, I happily have
not set foot on mass transit and have commuted exclusively by car.</TE>
<TE>   In my car, I have a good idea of the criminal record and intent of
those who ride with me; that isn't the case on mass transit. In my
car, I have some control over the odor of those who ride with me. I
control the time of departure, the temperature and the music. I can
eat and drink what I want, and always sit down.</TE>
<TE>   In my car, I have a seat belt and air bag to protect me, and don't
have to stand exposed to the elements before boarding my car. My car
operates 24 hours a day and smells nice.</TE>
<TE>   For these and other reasons, the worst day in a car on an Orange
County highway still provides a superior commuting experience than
the best day current or proposed mass-transit systems can ever hope
to offer.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Tatar</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm glad to see that NIMBYism is alive and well behind the Orange
curtain.</TE>
<TE>   I can appreciate that the residents of Irvine who opposed the
CenterLine project likely did so because of the noise and congestion
that construction would entail, in addition to noise produced by the
trains once they begin running.</TE>
<TE>   But those residents ought to consider that 600,000 people means
more cars on Orange County freeways, many of which are state highways
with only two lanes in either direction. If people moved to Orange
County to escape urban congestion, I can't fathom that people would
prefer to sit in traffic on freeways that can't accommodate the
volume.</TE>
<TE>   I can only hope that when those additional people arrive and turn
every freeway into a parking lot, some hypocrite doesn't turn around
and say, "Hey, let's extend CenterLine to connect more of the
county."</TE>

<LD>When Gov. Gray Davis signed Senate Bill 688, he told California that
it would benefit the victims of Sept. 11. But he neglected to mention
that the bill was designed to extend the length of response time to
summary judgments, making it impossible to speed up the dismissal of
frivolous lawsuits. Courts are already clogged with frivolous
litigation, and Davis and the trial lawyers who supported him made a
bad situation worse. This is another example of shameless efforts to
profit off 9/11.</LD>

<LD>Re "Dual-Language Classes: Are They Just a Waste of Words?," Letters,
Sept. 15:</LD>
<LD>   As a teacher for 30 years, the past four at the Santa Ana Unified
School District, I'm saddened by the growing number of fine children
(and their parents) being misled by some Latino leaders and
educators, and being enrolled in dual-immersion classes.</LD>
<LD>   Our students are some of the most dedicated and hard-working I've
ever encountered. Many are enrolled in an after-school program, and
last year I had almost half of my classes give up a hundred hours of
vacation time to attend classes to further their English skills. It
must never be said these children don't want to learn English.</LD>
<TE>   While some Latino educators and community members feebly argue the
merits of the "dual-immersion" program, citing theory or test scores
that have shown questionable gains (How much might they have grown in
an English-immersion program?), they ignore reality: Twenty years of
bilingual education has assured many Latino workers they'll be the
last hired, first fired, lowest paid and least educated, with the
highest dropout rate. Rather than point fingers and cry racism, why
not at least give English immersion a chance? Do leaders such as
Nativo Lopez truly care for these children, or is he still trying to
collect on the "us against them" mentality?</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Thrash</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I read with interest the issue in the Sunday Times about the
recall petition of Nativo Lopez. My stepson arrived here from China
in June 2001 with zero English. After less than six weeks here, he
started fifth grade. There was no one at his school who spoke
Mandarin, and even if there had been, we would have insisted on
English only.</TE>
<TE>   Armed only with an electronic dictionary and a can-do attitude,
within one year he is fluent in English and has a 3.5 grade-point
average that he hopes to improve to a 4.0. There's another side to
this issue as well. If we provide bilingual education for students
who speak Spanish, then in the interest of nondiscrimination, it must
be provided for any language. A rather daunting task, I would think.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez should get the message. Immersion in English is the only way
to go. If parents want their children educated in Spanish, then send
them to a boarding school in their home country. Of course, like
others, we don't want our son to forget Mandarin. We will make sure
that he gets continued education in his native language as well.
Also, we plan to have him take Spanish next year at middle school.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bushey</TE>
<TE>   Orange</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The dual-language idea is something that has found its time. My
grandchildren attend a Spanish-immersion public school in Portland,
Ore. From their first day in school they are taught math, science,
some social studies and language arts in Spanish for half of the day,
and writing, reading and social studies, including American history,
in English for the other half of the day.</TE>
<TE>   My three granddaughters, ages 7, 9 and 11, are fluent in Spanish
for their grade level and accomplished in English, their native
language. Their parents want them to have a mastery of at least two
languages so that they will be comfortable in the world and will be
able to contribute to that world. The parents choose to send their
children to this particular school and the student body is entirely
English-speaking children. They are bright, eager learners, and I
completely believe in this program.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who travels in Europe comes to realize that almost all
people there have at least two languages. This is a different idea
from bilingual education and should not be compared to it.</TE>

<LD>Re "Enrollment Rising at State's 2-Year Colleges," Sept. 11:</LD>
<LD>   Your informative article regarding increases in enrollment at
community colleges did not explain a significant reason behind the
financial pressure on many of them. Why can't students get some
classes? State apportionment is a major source of community college
revenue. But the state imposes a "growth cap" on each district. If a
district's enrollment exceeds that growth cap, the state does not
provide the additional funds to educate those students.</LD>
<LD>   For example, the North Orange County Community College District
exceeded its growth cap last year by about 1,000 students. We
educated those students. The state withheld funds from us for them.
This is the epitome of a rock and a hard place. Students need our
classes. The state turns its back on their needs. So we have to
consider inflating class sizes, cutting programs, cutting staffing,
rejecting students or whatever.</LD>
<TE>   This is not a result of the state's recent budget crunch. This has
been going on for years. Hopefully, someday the state will provide
funds based on the actual community college enrollments. We should
not be penalized for our enrollment growth.</TE>

<HD>When Will Fullerton Stop Filling Open Space?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My husband and I moved to Fullerton 4 1/2 years ago. We were
attracted by the open spaces such as Coyote Hills. We were delighted
to see so many species of birds, lizards, mammals and, yes, even
snakes, on our hikes along the trail bordering Coyote Hills and in
other once-open areas around the city.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine our disappointment when Fullerton started a massive
campaign to develop all the open areas left in the community.</LD>
<LD>   We don't understand the mind-set of our city's leaders. Aren't the
Amerige Heights project, the Turnleaf Homes development project (once
another favorite hiking spot) and the apartment complex at Lemon and
Amerige enough? We are very concerned with the effect another
development will have. Traffic is extremely heavy; schools are
overcrowded. Precious resources will be further depleted. The Chevron
development at Coyote Hills isn't an expansion of a tax base; it's an
increased tax burden to develop and maintain urban sprawl. The three
major development projects mentioned haven't even been completed yet.</LD>
<TE>   In viewing a recent "green map" of Orange County, very little open
green space is shown in northern Orange County. What does this mean?
Are southern Orange County residents more foresighted? Or do they
have more clout with political powers?</TE>

<HD>Tougher No-Smoking Ordinances Urged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mission Viejo's proposed anti-smoking ordinance appeared to go up in
smoke on Monday night. I was there and watched it happen.</LD>
<LD>   It would appear that Mission Viejo does not yet have the courage
to protect its citizens.</LD>
<LD>   While I certainly appreciate the difficulty of the city's
position, I feel strongly that this is an ordinance that must be
approved soon for the safety of all citizens.</LD>
<TE>   No one would argue that this is a simple problem. People have
rights in this country. We take great pride, and rightly so, in
protecting personal rights. But it is not legal to do harm. Our
rights stop at the point where we hurt others.</TE>
<TE>   As we have learned of the very real dangers of secondhand smoke,
most of us have realized that laws must soon be changed to protect
citizens. There are no safe levels of secondhand smoke. According to
the Journal of the American Medical Assn. (July 24, 2001), nonsmokers
are harmed by even brief exposure to passive smoke. This issue is not
about taking away people's right to smoke, but about protecting the
health and safety of others.</TE>
<TE>   Quite simply, when one's preference to smoke is a matter of life
and death to another, support of public health must come first.</TE>
<TE>   It is to be hoped that as the public is better educated, cities
will have the courage to step forward and do the right thing.</TE>

<HD>What the Angels Are Doing on the Field Should Fill the Park</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEAN J. SLOCUM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the night before the baseball strike was to begin I was at the Big
A (I don't know anybody named Edison) and saw a great game. The
Angels ripped the Devil Rays right from the start. I sat in an
expensive ticket-brokered seat on the first base line with a friend
who is a true fan of the greatest game ever conceived.</LD>
<LD>   The Oxford Dictionary of the English Language defines "fan" as a
devotee of a particular activity. Fans of what activity? Based upon
what I've seen over the years in Anaheim, the percentage of baseball
fans to overall "fans" at Angels home games has declined every year.</LD>
<LD>   We sat through the pregame rockets' red glare, the racket Disney
calls music, beach balls bouncing off our heads and the cheers of a
crowd weaned on "Funniest Home Videos." To top it off, we fended off
the sloshes and dribbles from foraging hordes who in one grand
evening consumed more calories than a small African nation does in a
year.</LD>
<TE>   What was happening on the field was incidental to the crowd's joy
in spending wads of money on choice seats and expensive baseball
gloves for preschoolers who soon learned that the chance of catching
a foul ball is practically nil and who probably didn't want to be at
the game anyway. Toward the end of the game, ire at the prospect of
the strike boiled over as fans tossed water bottles, baseballs, beach
balls and toilet paper onto the field. The announcer's pleas for
sanity and order went unheeded.</TE>
<TE>   The merciful ending was an anticlimax as a "Don't strike! Don't
strike!" chorus was drowned out by more rockets signaling to the
world beyond the gates that the home team had, indeed, won another
game.</TE>
<TE>   What I really don't get is why a winning team like the Angels is
having such a mediocre season in terms of attendance. They are going
lickety-split, having turned a sure losing season into the best one
ever. This team is a joy to cheer for. All that is lacking is more
real fans to fill the acres of empty seats beyond the first and third
base lines--fans who come to see baseball instead of making human
waves and tossing beach balls.</TE>
<TE>   I was raised in South Providence, R.I., and got my baseball
baptism at Fenway Park during the mid-1940s. My first game was
organized by a friend's aunt who herded three young boys onto a train
at Union Station. Fenway was packed to the rafters.</TE>
<TE>   I had never before seen so many people in one place at the same
time, let alone at a baseball game.</TE>
<TE>   Williams and Pesky and Doerr and DiMaggio carried the day, and I
tried to see and hear everything on and around the field.</TE>
<TE>   The fans knew so much more than I did. From kids to adults,
everyone seemed to know everything about the Red Sox players--batting
averages, RBIs, ERAs, everything but players' cap sizes. Sure, people
ate and drank and even smoked, but they were there for the game and
were at one with the drama.</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't afford to go to many games but kept glued to the family
radio whenever the Red Sox played. Home games were broadcast live,
and away games were "re-created" by a genius named Jim Britt who, to
the incessant clicking and clacking of a teletype machine, decoded
telegraphic symbols to produce an exciting and thoroughly believable
re-creation of what was going on in Cleveland or New York.</TE>
<TE>   The tape would deliver information like "Williams F8," which meant
a long fly ball to center field. Britt would transform that cryptic
bit of information into something like "Feller takes a long windup
and delivers a knee-high fastball to Williams. Ted drives it deep
into center field!" A few clicks later, he'd announce a great catch
in center or another home run for the Kid.</TE>
<TE>   Britt would turn GDP543 into "Pesky hits a sizzling grounder to
third." Click, click, click. "Right into a double play, second to
first!"</TE>
<TE>   Years later I drove endless miles from Seattle to Corpus Christi
and Los Angeles to Denver selling schoolbooks that teachers didn't
understand and kids hated. The telegraph was long dead by then, but I
used the car radio to tune into games, no matter who was playing. I
would roar down the road listening with rapt attention to every word
spoken. In my mind's eye, every game was being played in Fenway Park.
I laugh about it today, but it was very real then.</TE>
<TE>   So here we are in prosperous times in the land of plenty with a
winning team playing exciting baseball. What we need is more fans of
the serious variety who can fill the acres of empty seats at--OK,
I'll say it--Edison International Field to enjoy a great game of
baseball.</TE>

<LD>Though I've been on summer vacation for four months, my stomach is
still in sync with the daily meal cycles of Boston University's dorm
cafeterias. With Lobster Night, made-to-order sushi and unlimited
self-serve ice cream, whose wouldn't?</LD>
<LD>   It's 4 p.m. here in Orange County, but the growling in my belly
tells me it is dinnertime. I'm no longer a student at BU, but just
for fun, I like to Instant Message my friends back East and ask them
about the daily menu at Warren Towers, my old dorm.</LD>
<LD>   In May, I decided not to return to Boston University. Instead,
I've become a commuter Anteater at UC Irvine. I'm living at home and
I'm loving it.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, I have my own bathroom and my own room. And, now that I
have my own car, the weekly grocery shopping isn't an all-day
excursion.</TE>
<TE>   My decision to return to UC Irvine meant going against the flow,
since California is one of the largest feeder states to the private
university system on the East Coast. At BU, the Class of 2006 has at
least 250 Californians, almost equal to the amount of students from
such nearby states as New York and Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Attending a university on the other side of the country can be
very appealing to Southern California students. Many feel the need to
get away to completely separate themselves from the environment
they've known all their lives.</TE>
<TE>   However, after a year or two, the excitement of leaving friends
and family behind often fades. Traveling back and forth during the
winter, spring and summer breaks takes its toll. Most students live
out of their suitcases since their computers and personal items are
in storage.</TE>
<TE>   Because flying home for three days is just too expensive,
Thanksgivings are usually spent alone in a hotel room with takeout
food. Unfortunately, many of the larger dorms close over the
holidays. For a student so far away from home, East Coast university
life can become very lonely.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine states on its Web site that about 20% of its 2001
transfer class was not from California community colleges. That leads
me to believe that many transfer students find that they would prefer
to live at home and commute to school rather than choose a campus
where they would be forced to live in a dorm and begin the whole
college process again.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, almost all of the friends I made at BU were from
California. One of my closest BU friends lives in Fullerton and made
the decision to leave the East Coast behind and attend UC Santa
Barbara, her original first choice.</TE>
<TE>   At BU, native Californians had a tendency to stick together. My
friends and I could always tell when someone was from California,
whether it was the way they dressed, the way they spoke or the
selection of CDs in their backpacks.</TE>
<TE>   Many Californians find it difficult to connect with the
Boston-East Coast mind-set. Personally, I'd never been an Abercrombie
&amp; Fitch customer, nor had I been to any Dave Matthews concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, I didn't pronounce the word 'car' as 'cah.' On
campus, I felt like a walking vacation brochure for Orange County.
Even in January, I still had my natural tan and I wore flip-flops
when it rained. While Roxy is a household clothing brand in Southern
California, most people at BU thought that Roxy was my name and that
I was obsessed with personalizing all of my clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Although my transfer to UC Irvine will make my home life and my
social life much easier, my academic route of study is sure to
suffer. At BU, I was well on my way to finishing my English major
requirements as well as my general education requirements. In fact, I
was even looking into an art history or visual arts minor because I
had two whole semesters of free choice electives. But now that I am
at UC Irvine, I'm starting from scratch. It's as if my hard work at
BU was simply a waste of time and $60,000. I'll be lucky if I
graduate simply as an English major in two years at UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Yet I have no regrets about the time I spent at Boston University.
I still adore the campus, and the professors I had for the past two
years were enlightening and helpful. The life lessons I've learned
being away on my own truly have no price tag. Whether my credits
transfer or not, the Astronomy 104 course I took as a freshman or the
Caribbean fiction lectures I participated in have helped me become a
more rounded person.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, I'm glad to be back in Orange County, where I can
have dinner with my family every night and wear Roxy tank tops
without getting stares. It's the greatest feeling to know that I am
home for good.</TE>

<HD>Allen Parkinson, 83; Sleep-Eze Mogul Built Movieland Wax
Museum</HD>

<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allen Parkinson, a star-struck entrepreneur who made a fortune with
his over-the-counter sleep aid and then built a world-class wax
museum dedicated to Hollywood legends, has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Parkinson, the creator of Sleep-Eze and the original owner of
Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, died of natural causes Aug. 19 at
his home in Warwick, R.I.</LD>
<LD>   With a showman's flair, Parkinson opened Movieland Wax Museum in
May 1962 with all the hoopla of a Hollywood premiere: searchlights,
bleachers holding thousands of fans and the arrival of stars in long
black limousines.</LD>
<TE>   No less than Mary Pickford cut the ceremonial ribbon at the Beach
Boulevard museum, which included a wax likeness of America's
Sweetheart and dozens of other film greats ranging from Rudolph
Valentino to James Dean.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak in the 1960s, Movieland drew as many as 1.2 million
visitors a year, and Hollywood superstars considered it an honor to
be selected for enshrinement in wax.</TE>
<TE>   With the addition of each new star's wax likeness to the museum,
Parkinson would send a gold Rolls-Royce to bring the honored
celebrity to Buena Park in style.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a man with tremendous imagination," recalled Beebe Kline,
a former vice president of the publicity firm Rogers &amp; Cowan, who
represented Sophia Loren in 1962 when she was included in the museum
in a scene from "Two Women."</TE>
<TE>   Kline recalled that Parkinson flew to Loren's villa in Italy,
where the actress presented him with the dress she had worn in the
film, for which she won an Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever he did anything, he always met with the people," said
Kline. "They had to have pictures, all of the exact measurements and
everything so they could duplicate them."</TE>
<TE>   Parkinson followed up Movieland with the nearby Japanese Village
and Deer Park, and the museum-adjoining Palace of Living Art, for
which he hired sculptors to re-create classic paintings in
three-dimensional wax figures.</TE>
<TE>   "He was definitely a dreamer," Emily Hamilton, Parkinson's
granddaughter, said Friday. "He just loved thinking of new ideas.
He'd sit at the dinner table and say, 'What do you think of this
idea?' And it was always the idea rather than the money [that
interested him]. It was more just thinking of different fun things."</TE>
<TE>   For someone who "couldn't do math--he was a brilliant man, but he
had no concept of math at all," Hamilton said with a laugh, "it was
amazing he made money."</TE>
<TE>   Born on a farm in Rexburg, Idaho, Parkinson grew up in Salt Lake
City, where he fell in love with the movies.</TE>
<TE>   "For most of us in those Depression years," he once said, "movies
were the windows on the world."</TE>
<TE>   After various jobs such as selling Indian jewelry in several
Western states, he joined the merchant marine in 1939. After World
War II, he quickly worked his way up from a salesman to international
sales manager for Mercury Records.</TE>
<TE>   He was working as a salesman for a wine company in 1948 when he
noticed an ad in a Canadian newspaper for a sleep aid called
Persomnia.</TE>
<TE>   Plagued by insomnia himself, Parkinson thought the idea of a sleep
aid was good but the name was terrible.</TE>
<TE>   After coming up with what he felt was a better name--Sleep-Eze--he
engaged chemists in a product development company.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow insomniacs turned non-barbiturate Sleep-Eze into a
bestseller that gave Parkinson a million-dollar payday when he sold
it in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by a 1958 visit to London with his daughter where he saw
a block-long line of people waiting to view the historical wax
figures in Madame Tussaud's wax museum, Parkinson figured people
would line up to see wax versions of Hollywood stars.</TE>
<TE>   He launched a worldwide search for the world's best sculptors and
sank all of his Sleep-Eze fortune into buying land near Knott's Berry
Farm and building a modern, white-columned museum building furnished
with crystal chandeliers.</TE>
<TE>   When he saw Hollywood's biggest stars disgorging from their limos
the night of the $1.5-million museum's opening, he recalled a few
years later, "I couldn't believe my eyes. I was still the kid with
the popcorn in the balcony."</TE>
<TE>   Movieland Wax Museum Vice President Rodney Fong, whose family
bought the business in 1980, praised Parkinson "for the level of
passion he had for the movie industry in creating sets and wax
figures" at the museum</TE>
<TE>   The sets, Fong said, "were really three-dimensional. You don't
walk past these sets, you actually walk into many of them. It's a
huge accomplishment, especially if you take into consideration that a
wax museum is a static display.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only create that through passion. Not only the wax museum
but his other projects were a passion."</TE>
<TE>   Parkinson sold Movieland and the other two attractions to Six
Flags for $10 million in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   "He got bored," said his granddaughter. "He wanted to do something
else."</TE>
<TE>   He sold his home in Costa Mesa and bought a 40,000-acre ranch in
Scottsdale, Ariz., where he raised horses and bred cattle.</TE>
<TE>   But after about eight years on the ranch, his granddaughter said,
"he lost almost everything" in the stock market downturn and wound up
declaring bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Parkinson, who was ill with cancer and heart problems in the last
year, remained a dreamer until the end, his granddaughter said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the last day of his life, he was like, 'What do you think of
... ?' He was trying to start another business."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his granddaughter, Parkinson is survived by his
daughter, Patricia Noel of Alamo, Calif., near San Francisco; two
other grandchildren; and a great-grandson.</TE>

<HD>Television's Emmys: Honors or Also-Rans?</HD>
<DH>Awards: Small screen's highest prize neither attracts
viewers nor boosts stars' salaries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Postponed twice last year by events related to the Sept. 11 attacks,
the 53rd annual Emmy Awards finally went on in early November with a
telecast that most critics felt captured the right tone--only to draw
its lowest rating in more than a decade, overshadowed by competition
from the seventh and deciding game of the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   Yet while last year's tumult was clearly extraordinary, the
roller-coaster ride that the television industry's premier awards
experienced last fall seemed to underscore the supporting role the
winged statuette has long played in Hollywood as a sort of Rodney
Dangerfield among the industry's major honors.</LD>
<LD>   That's because in an entertainment business increasingly devoted
to the bottom line, the Emmys simply don't provide the obvious
financial benefits associated with other award shows--specifically,
the Oscars, which recognize the best in film; the Grammys, honoring
music; and the Tonys, devoted to theater.</LD>
<TE>   Those who work on television shows certainly covet the respect
denoted by the Emmys, which will be handed out tonight at Shrine
Auditorium. Among network executives, however, the award seems to
generate less enthusiasm--indicative of a time when ratings are
harder than ever to come by and the imprimatur of quality is no
assurance of success.</TE>
<TE>   "It means absolutely nothing to their business," one former
network executive said. "The attitude is, 'That doesn't translate
into viewers, so who cares?' "</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, nominations for Oscars reliably boost a film's box
office earnings, as well as video and DVD rentals. Performing on the
Grammy telecast can lead to more CDs flying off shelves. Tonys can be
the difference between Broadway plays and musicals extending their
runs or closing.</TE>
<TE>   Film executives cite a clear correlation between Oscars and
income. "It's stunning to see the pattern replicate itself year after
year," said Mark Gill, president of Miramax Films in Los Angeles. For
lower-budgeted films in particular, he noted, "an Oscar nomination
means at least 100% increase in box office results, and maybe 150%.
It's a massive difference."</TE>
<TE>   In television--where, with the exception of pay cable, viewers can
sample a product for free and just as quickly be gone--the value of
such recognition is more muddled. "An Oscar can be translated into X
millions of dollars more at the box office," said Herbert Schlosser,
a former president of NBC. With the Emmy, "that kind of direct effect
doesn't exist."</TE>
<TE>   In certain instances, an Emmy has helped elevate a program's
ratings or bought a struggling show additional time. NBC famously
parlayed Emmys for "Hill Street Blues" and "Cheers" into promotion
for those programs in the 1980s, leading to long and profitable runs.
More recently, pay channel Home Box Office has used the honors heaped
on "Sex and the City," "The Sopranos" and "Six Feet Under" as an
inducement for viewers to subscribe--successfully wooing Emmy voters
with lavish ad campaigns and videotape mailings to herald its
lesser-seen programs.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, however, the awards have a tendency to recognize TV
shows that are already popular and have relatively little to gain
beyond adding to their prestige. NBC's "The West Wing," for example,
already a ratings powerhouse, has been named best drama the last two
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Network officials also have come to resent HBO's prominence at the
Emmys and other awards. While most executives were reluctant to
publicly downplay the awards, one derisively referred to the Emmys as
"the CableACE Awards"--alluding to a now-defunct award that
exclusively honored cable fare, initiated before cable programs
became eligible for Emmy consideration in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Ambivalence about the exposure afforded HBO may also be a factor
as negotiations on a new television agreement for the Emmys drag on
without resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Under the existing contract, the Emmys rotate among the four major
networks--ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox--and pay the Academy of Television
Arts &amp; Sciences, the nonprofit group that presents the awards, about
$3 million a year. The host network shoulders roughly an additional
$4 million in production costs.</TE>
<TE>   That fee makes the Emmy the poor kid on the block compared with
the $50 million and $25 million, respectively, paid to organizers of
the Oscars and Grammys, who produce their own telecasts. The TV
academy hopes to secure a major increase. But with the networks
complaining about rising costs, executives are reluctant to spend
much more for the rights.</TE>
<TE>   The Emmys face other issues that may contribute to their
second-class status, among them a "been there, done that" mentality.
The same programs are often nominated repeatedly. A case in point is
NBC's "Law &amp; Order," which tied a record this year with its 11th
consecutive nomination for outstanding drama series.</TE>
<TE>   "The same movie doesn't win two years in a row," said producer
Steven Bochco, who has won Emmys for "Hill Street Blues," "L.A. Law"
and "NYPD Blue." "There is a kind of sameness to it ... that makes it
more of a yawn."</TE>
<TE>   NBC's "Frasier," for example, was named best comedy five
consecutive years during the 1990s. Candice Bergen and John
Larroquette--after winning repeatedly for "Murphy Brown" and "Night
Court," respectively--eventually withdrew their names to give others
a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Although the TV academy has more than 11,000 members, critics say
that in the past, it has done a poor job of involving younger
members, leading to stodginess and predictability in its choices.</TE>
<TE>   At a board meeting a few years ago, former President Jim Chabin
sought to demonstrate the need to broaden the membership, insiders
recall, by rattling off a who's who of young producers behind such
shows as "Felicity," "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Dawson's
Creek"--none of whom, it turned out, belonged to the academy.
(Recognizing new technologies, membership is now open to anyone who
is or has been "actively engaged in activities related to the
production or distribution of audiovisual works for national
exhibition by means of telecommunications," according to the group's
bylaws.)</TE>
<TE>   Emmy organizers say they have worked to address such concerns and
are particularly excited about this year's nominations, which saw an
unusual number of newcomers break through, from cable network FX's
gritty police show "The Shield" to Fox's serialized drama "24" and
the star of its comedy "The Bernie Mac Show"--new blood, they say,
that has heightened interest in the ceremony, to be hosted by NBC
late-night talk show host Conan O'Brien.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an array of competing awards, TV academy Chairman Bryce
Zabel said, "the Emmy continues to hold up as the gold standard of
excellence in television"--as coveted, he contends, as any honor
except the Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   As for the repetition factor, Richard Frank, a former president of
the TV academy and Walt Disney Studios, said television deserves more
respect given the challenge posed by annually producing 22 episodes
or more of a prime-time series.</TE>
<TE>   "When you release an album or a movie, you're done with that album
or movie," he said. "In television, if you're successful, you have to
do it every week for the next seven years."</TE>
<TE>   Industry veterans also point to somewhat intangible benefits
associated with Emmy notice. Garnering awards for a show "puts a
little polish on it when you go out to sell [the reruns] into
syndication," Frank said, and inspires networks to provide the show
with additional promotion, which can help generate interest among
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "It remains the single most prestigious recognition on the part of
our peers that exists," said Peter Roth, president of Warner Bros.
Television, which produces "The West Wing," "ER" and "Friends."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, despite the cynicism surrounding the almost weekly
deluge of televised awards--from MTV to the Screen Actors Guild
honors--those in the production community appear less blase about the
Emmy than do those who employ them.</TE>
<TE>   Producer J.J. Abrams--a nominee for writing ABC's sleek spy drama
"Alias"--was particularly pleased to see his crew rewarded, with the
show garnering 11 nominations in all.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been nominated for anything," he said. "I was
thrilled. I was shocked in a way only good can come of it. I'm
grateful for the recognition these people are getting.... It's going
to be a fun thing for my wife and I to go. I've never been to the
Emmys."</TE>
<TE>   Abrams' father, Gerry, has also been an Emmy nominee, most
recently as a producer of the TNT miniseries "Nuremberg." He
maintains that the Emmys are no less important than other major
awards but simply operate in a different financial framework--unlike
feature films, say, where an Oscar leads to a higher salary on the
next project.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning an Emmy improves your pedigree but not necessarily your
very next paycheck," the elder Abrams said. "But that's just the way
TV works.... People get rich in TV from doing a large body of work
over a long period of time."</TE>
<TE>   The six stars of "Friends," for example, have thus far claimed
just one Emmy among them during the show's eight-year run--a
supporting award for Lisa Kudrow, who plays Phoebe. They are
nevertheless among the highest-paid performers on television, earning
$1 million each per episode.</TE>

<HD>Avalanche Wipes Out Village in South Russia</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>A valley in Russia's North Ossetia region lay entombed Saturday after
a section of Caucasus glacier broke off and plowed through, scooping
up trees, truck-sized boulders and buildings in a thunderous 20-mile
wave of destruction.</LD>
<LD>   When the avalanche stopped, icy debris as deep as 50 yards covered
at least one village and left one of Russia's best-known movie actors
missing, along with 27 members of his crew. Authorities conducting a
massive rescue operation late Saturday--24 hours after the
slide--estimated that as many as 100 people could still be missing or
dead.</LD>
<LD>   They included 17 people, six of them children, whose homes were
destroyed in the village of Nizhny Karmadon, said Lt. Gen. Ivan
Teterin, the Emergency Situations Ministry official heading the
rescue efforts. Also unaccounted for were hikers in the area and
members of the film crew of actor-director Sergei Bodrov Jr. Bodrov,
a star of the movie "Prisoner of the Mountains" and two emblematic
crime thrillers of Russia's roaring 1990s--"Brother" and "Brother
II"--was in the area working on a new film.</LD>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, speaking in Moscow, declared
the avalanche "truly a great disaster." Putin told reporters: "The
main task is to find the missing people and restore the region's
infrastructure--I mean electric lines and vital necessities."</TE>
<TE>   The avalanche began around 9 p.m. Friday, said Ruslan Mutsuyev, a
duty officer in North Ossetia for the Emergency Situations Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "People were already in their houses. Some vacationers were in
their tents too. Some people had gone up there in their cars and
trucks for a weekend at this picturesque site and were sleeping in
their cars or trucks," where they would have been caught unaware, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Mutsuyev said, the area between the communities of
Karmadon and Dargavs was inundated by ice and mud.</TE>
<TE>   "Our men flew over the area several times in helicopters, and they
discovered that the slide buried part of the Karmadon village called
Nizhny Karmadon, where there were about 10 houses in which about 30
people lived," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mutsuyev said the avalanche also destroyed a rest home where
people took mineral baths.</TE>
<TE>   "Mounds of ice and mud are so thick that in places it is 50 yards
deep, if not deeper," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As the scale of the disaster became evident Saturday, Russia
mobilized emergency workers from the regional center of Vladikavkaz.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 143 rescue workers on the spot and dozens of trucks and
bulldozers. But unfortunately, we have had to suspend the operation
for the night," said Nickolai Shamakov, another officer for the
emergency ministry in North Ossetia, speaking by telephone late
Saturday. "It is very dangerous on the slippery ice in the mountains
in the dark."</TE>
<TE>   Mutsuyev called the catastrophe unprecedented in his experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I have lived in this area for 53 years now, and I don't remember
a tragedy like this. Up to now, it has been a very safe area," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   For rescuers, there exists the ongoing danger that the ice could
shift again, causing a new avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mutsuyev said he was not giving up hope for more
survivors, he believed that the outlook was grim.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people would have been taken by complete surprise....
Hundreds of rescue workers have been clearing the site all day, and
so far they haven't found any bodies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities estimated that the glacier section that broke off was
500 feet deep and that as it crashed down it exceeded 60 mph. The
main part of the avalanche came to rest on the Gizel-Karmadon
highway, about six miles from Vladikavkaz.</TE>
<TE>   Teterin said one man from near Nizhny Karmadon was found dead. A
spokesman for North Ossetian President Alexander S. Dzasokhov said
four bodies were found, the Interfax news agency reported.</TE>

<HD>Accent Gets in the Way When Bavarian Candidate Speaks to
the Germans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>When northern Germans answer the telephone or encounter a friend on
the street, they say a simple guten tag--good day.</LD>
<LD>   But in the south, the salutation is gruess gott--greet God--an
expression so common it no longer really alludes to religious worship
but still puts off those unused to a custom dating to the Crusades.</LD>
<LD>   Much about the southern lilt in the language of Bavarians grates
on the ears and nerves of other Germans, and that cultural clash may
help explain why Edmund Stoiber was turning off voters still making
up their minds ahead of today's election.</LD>
<TE>   The Bavaria state governor, who is challenging Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder for the leadership of the country, had aired his views
mostly via print interviews until two recent televised debates. Those
head-to-head clashes with his more telegenic opponent put his
southern ways before the eyes--and ears--of millions of voters.</TE>
<TE>   A muddled policy on how to deal with Iraq and a dearth of
expertise on environmental issues have hurt the head of the Christian
Social Union in his bid to become the first member of his
conservative party to lead modern Germany. But as the perceived
embodiment of socially restrictive Roman Catholicism aiming to rule a
more liberal and predominantly Protestant land, Stoiber and his
singsong Bavarian accent have increasingly been getting a cold
reception.</TE>
<TE>   "The party would have had better chances if they had chosen Angela
Merkel," German history professor Laurenz Demps said of the more
moderate northerner who heads the Christian Democratic Union, which
is aligned with Stoiber's party. "Southerners are not so well loved
up here. That is a fact. But the Bavarians are so insular, they don't
even know that."</TE>
<TE>   No one is saying Stoiber is going to lose because of his accent or
even because of his views on family and social policy, which
northerners tend to see as old-fashioned. But in a race as close as
the one that ends today, such personal nuances could be influential.</TE>
<TE>   Guided by his Hamburg media advisor, Michael Spreng, Stoiber
abandoned his customary green felt hat and boiled wool jackets for
three-piece suits when he was on northern campaign trails. He also
steered clear of the beer halls and oompah bandstands that were his
usual platforms when he stumped in friendly territory.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he was pelted with rotten vegetables and empty bottles at
recent rallies, prompting his aides and security detachment to carry
large umbrellas to protect the candidate and themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The 60-year-old Stoiber brushes off suggestions that he is hitting
a cultural barrier that can't be breached.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been said that a Bavarian doesn't stand a chance because
of resistance in the north," Stoiber recently told journalists. "But
I think that time has passed. I think northerners have changed. They
are more tolerant now."</TE>
<TE>   Stoiber carries an added burden among his northern countrymen: He
says he will install a raft of fellow southerners in the Cabinet if
his alliance wins. His expected choice for overseeing a new economics
super-ministry, former Baden-Wuerttemberg state Gov. Lothar Spaeth,
is widely admired. But the Bavarian likely to take over the vital
Interior Ministry, Guenther Beckstein, is a northern liberal's
nightmare. Now serving as state interior minister in Bavaria,
Beckstein espouses archconservative and right-wing religious
doctrines that have set him apart from many even in his own party.</TE>
<TE>   And although Stoiber has been careful to toe a centrist line,
especially during his northern campaign swings, analysts see his
views on women and family as out of step with the social mainstream,
even if he has appointed a single mother from the east as an advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Asked during the first TV debate what role he saw for a
politician's wife, Stoiber replied stiffly that his own spouse,
Karin, provides moral support but doesn't talk politics with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe that would be appropriate," Stoiber told the
biggest German television audience ever to tune in to a political
program.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder, whose fourth wife is a former journalist and a
generation younger than her husband and the Stoibers, was able to put
himself forward as the feminist's advocate in his response.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to ask myself what kind of perception of women one must
have to want to reduce one's wife to being friendly and nice but
silent on political issues," Schroeder said, drawing praise from
post-debate commentators of both sexes.</TE>
<TE>   Germans vote for political parties rather than directly for a
chancellor, with the victorious party or biggest faction in an
alliance seating its lead candidate in the chancellery. But voters
are increasingly choosing parties with personalities in mind, and
Schroeder is far more popular than his rival.</TE>
<TE>   The conservatives lag the ruling Social Democrats by only two or
three percentage points in most voter surveys. But recently Stoiber
ranked ninth among individual politicians, with a 50% approval
rating, compared with second place and 73% for Schroeder. Germany's
most popular politician is leftist Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer,
who had an 81% positive rating.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the shift toward Schroeder and his Social Democrats in the
closing days of the campaign came from the huge bloc of undecided
voters just making up their minds. Most of those fence-sitters hail
from the north and east; most southerners have long demonstrated
their intention of voting for Stoiber.</TE>
<TE>   Serious issues drove the campaign, with Schroeder picking up
strength for his deft handling of a recent flood catastrophe and for
assuring Germans he won't enter a looming war against Iraq that he
has labeled a U.S. "adventure."</TE>
<TE>   But scholars of the German psyche say the geographic issue has
been a factor, especially among easterners whose atheistic Communist
past makes them wary of people overtly asserting their religion.</TE>
<TE>   "For a lot of people, this is undesirable," Demps, history
professor at Berlin's Humboldt University, said of the Bavarians'
invocation of God in every greeting. "We in the north prefer a
society that is unconfessionalized."</TE>

<LD>Austria's worst flooding in centuries left behind a deadly legacy: a
bumper crop of mushrooms that's luring amateur pickers to
forests--and sending some to the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   At least two people have died after eating poisonous mushrooms,
and scores have sought treatment, said Dr. Helmut Schiel of Austria's
poison control center.</LD>
<LD>   Heavy rains last month created perfect conditions for the growth
of mushrooms and other fungi.</LD>
<TE>   Of the 3,000 kinds of mushrooms in Austria, only a couple of
hundred varieties are edible. Two hundred are strongly poisonous, and
10 are deadly.</TE>

<HD>Conflict Is Personal for Two Old Mideast Enemies</HD>
<DH>Politics: As Arafat struggles for political survival,
Sharon seems to be trying to eliminate him--even if he's not the
problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat, two of the Middle East's most
steadfast enemies, are locked in what may be their final showdown,
the denouement of a decades-old struggle whose outcome could reshape
the region.</LD>
<LD>   Coiled by barbed wire and trapped nose-to-turret with Israeli
tanks, Arafat on Saturday was fighting for his life--political, at
the very least, if not physical.</LD>
<LD>   His archnemesis, Sharon, appeared more determined than ever to put
an end to Arafat's regime. For Sharon, the destruction this weekend
at Arafat's headquarters is part of a career-long mission to
eliminate the Palestinian leader and cripple Palestinian nationalism.</LD>
<TE>   Reviled by many Israelis as an unreconstructed terrorist
mastermind, lionized by many Palestinians as the ultimate symbol of
their independence and aspirations to nationhood, Arafat is
undoubtedly nearing the end of a long line of conflicts and political
upheavals. Ever the survivor, he cannot be counted out completely;
he's been here before. Each time tanks surrounded him in recent
months, he cited 1982 Beirut, where then-Defense Minister Sharon lay
siege to Arafat's headquarters for 88 days, until the Palestinian was
allowed to escape to Tunisia.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike during previous attempts by Israel (and specifically by
Sharon) to be rid of him, Arafat, 73, is in poor health, bereft of
most international support, at the helm of a fatigued public and
wobbling on an increasingly shaky political base whose members rose
up just this month to challenge him as never before.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's goal now is to take advantage of that weakness--weakness
that he would no doubt take credit for causing--and push Arafat as
far to the edge as possible so that he falls, or jumps.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon for now has decided not to expel Arafat from the
Palestinian territories, his aides said, in a concession to warnings
from his top intelligence advisors that to do so would restore
legitimacy to the aging guerrilla ("pump air into a flat tire," as
one Israeli commentator put it) while unleashing further chaos on the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli prime minister also has promised President Bush not to
kill or physically harm Arafat, a promise he later said he regretted
making. The army insisted again Saturday that Arafat is not the
target of the dynamite-and-bulldozer assault on his offices.</TE>
<TE>   However, Sharon apparently wants to make life so untenable for
Arafat, who is confined to one trembling floor of a British
mandate-era building amid the dusty, smoking ruins of his once
elaborate headquarters, that the Palestinian leader will turn himself
in or seek exile of his own accord.</TE>
<TE>   "We are attempting to encourage an alternative leadership," said
Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin.</TE>
<TE>   Saeb Erekat, a senior member of Arafat's government, dismissed as
bogus Israel's claims that the raid on Arafat's headquarters was
aimed at flushing out about 20 Palestinians holed up there who
allegedly are implicated in attacks on Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about [retaliation]. This is not about wanted men,"
he said. "This is about destroying the Palestinian Authority."</TE>
<TE>   Even Sharon's aides acknowledged that the bus bombing in Tel Aviv
on Thursday that ostensibly triggered the assault on Arafat's
compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah was but a pretext. As
tragic as the deaths of five Israelis and a Scot were, the toll was
by no means unusually large. And the attack, along with one the
previous day, came after a remarkable six-week period without suicide
bombings inside Israel and at a time when Palestinians were engaged
in a significant process of reform demanded by both Israel and
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The [army] would have carried out the operation in Ramallah even
if Thursday's bombing didn't take place," Sharon's Cabinet secretary,
Gideon Saar, was quoted as saying Saturday. "The weakening of Arafat
is a clear Israeli interest, but also a Palestinian one."</TE>
<TE>   The Tel Aviv bombing was the work of the radical Islamic
organization Hamas, which Arafat does not control. In fact,
Palestinians have long contended--and some Israelis concur--that
Arafat has lost control of most of the militias attacking Israelis.
His ability to operate in a West Bank that has been taken over almost
completely by the Israeli military is questionable at best,
Palestinians say.</TE>
<TE>   How, then, would eliminating him resolve the problem? It wouldn't,
according to Israeli and Palestinian analysts. The idea, they say, is
for Israel to flex its considerable muscle to destroy Arafat
regardless of whether he had anything to do with a specific terrorist
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Going after Arafat reflects the personal, visceral nature of the
fight between Sharon and the Palestinian Authority president, two war
horses for whom conflict is normal and peace problematic.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon's strategy risks backfiring on a number of levels. If
any harm comes to Arafat, the anger in the Arab world would
complicate U.S. efforts to conduct a war on Iraq. It would probably
fuel more, not less, terrorism. And the voices of reform and
moderation that have been emerging in Palestinian society would be
silenced once again.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few weeks, some Palestinian factions have indicated a
willingness to halt attacks against Israelis, while the Palestinian
Authority has begun a training program with American and Egyptian
advisors for security officers whose stated task was to have been
reining in gunmen. And the Palestinian Legislative Council showed
rare independence by refusing to ratify Arafat's new Cabinet this
month, demanding that he do better to control corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's actions could derail the reforms and stifle this crucial
challenge from within, analysts and diplomats say.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, one of the men trapped inside Arafat's compound this
weekend is his new finance minister, Salam Fayyad, a respected former
official with the International Monetary Fund who was spearheading
genuine change and had won the praise of Washington, and even of
Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Israel was impressed with the reforms and wanted to stop
them," Palestinian Labor Minister Ghassan Khatib said Saturday. He
suggested that Sharon was afraid Arafat would use the reforms, along
with elections scheduled for January, to gain a new lease on life.
Arafat is widely expected to win the upcoming vote.</TE>
<TE>   An attack on Arafat could also be counterproductive, analysts say,
because it could bolster extremists such as Hamas, whose spiritual
leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, has not been targeted by Israel in the
last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat "is in a coma, oxygen tubes and fluids keep him alive,"
noted Roni Shaked, Palestinian affairs reporter for Israel's largest
newspaper, Yediot Aharonot. "He has no influence on what happens on
the ground. Even if he wanted to stop terror attacks, he no longer
can.... If Israel decides to remove him or to hurt him physically,
this will be the greatest gift Sharon could give to Sheik Yassin."</TE>
<TE>   Because he still enjoys considerable public support, Sharon's
hands are tied by only two things: American reaction and fears that
his coalition government will fall apart.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has only rarely criticized Sharon, giving
him a green light for a wide range of aggressive tactics. But with
Washington planning a new war, it can ill afford explosions in Israel
and the Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   As for domestic politics, Sharon's main coalition partner, the
center-left Labor Party, has threatened to quit if Arafat is thrown
out of the country. Sharon's government could survive, but the prime
minister also faces a challenge from the right, where disgruntled
constituents don't think that he has acted with sufficient force
against the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   A new billboard campaign in Israel illustrates the threat.</TE>
<TE>   "With this kind of Sharon, Bibi would be better," says the message
promoting former Prime Minister Benjamin "Bibi" Netanyahu, Sharon's
principal rival on the right. "No peace. No security. No economy."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has steadily ratcheted up pressure on the Palestinians
during the last two years and especially since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks on the U.S. In the corridors of a receptive Washington, he
has been able to tar Arafat with the same brush as Osama bin Laden
and his Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   As the Palestinians' armed uprising wore on, as suicide bombings
increased at an alarming rate and as Arafat embraced violence, Sharon
repeatedly pushed the boundaries of what the world would accept in
his military response. Sharon, and the horror of the bombings, lulled
the world into accepting actions once unthinkable. Few would have
predicted, for example, that Israel would reoccupy the West Bank, as
it did this year, and place hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
under virtual house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   If he succeeds in finally toppling Arafat and destroying the
Palestinian Authority, established by the landmark 1993 Oslo peace
accords, Sharon will have rewritten history. With Arafat his
accomplice, the two will have reversed a process--Oslo--that most
observers believed was irreversible.</TE>
<TE>   The question remains, what would replace Oslo and Arafat? Sharon
has always favored a compliant, malleable Palestinian leadership that
Israel could in effect control. But if Arafat meets a violent end,
the chaos that would follow would more likely pro- duce further
intransigence, not cooperation.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Excludes Palaces From Inspection Sites</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Baghdad now opposes 'new, bad resolutions'
involving access to compounds. Bush reviews detailed military
options.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After agreeing last week to allow U.N. weapons inspectors
unconditional access, Iraq reversed course Saturday and said it would
not abide by any new U.N. resolution allowing monitors entry to key
presidential compounds.</LD>
<LD>   Baghdad's latest gambit came as the Bush administration was
preparing for a week of intense lobbying both at home and at the
United Nations to win passage of at least one resolution needed to
confront Iraqi President Saddam Hussein over his alleged failure to
surrender weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   While Washington is still pursuing a diplomatic course, the
administration is also fine-tuning military plans in the event Iraq
fails to cooperate. President Bush is reviewing detailed military
options delivered to the White House by the Pentagon this month, U.S.
officials said Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "He has options before him, and he is reviewing those options,"
White House spokesman Sean McCormack said.</TE>
<TE>   The classified document was drawn up by Army Gen. Tommy Franks,
chief of Central Command, the unit that would orchestrate an
offensive in the Persian Gulf region. It outlines the requirements to
wage war, including numbers of troops, warplanes, ships and
munitions, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Franks, who stopped in Kuwait during a tour of the region to talk
with local commanders, said Saturday that his forces were ready.</TE>
<TE>   "We are prepared to undertake whatever activities and whatever
actions we may be directed to take by our nation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Franks cautioned, however, that no decision had been made.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi announcement, which followed a meeting between Hussein
and his top officials, could further complicate delicate diplomatic
efforts to avoid the use of force.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq declared it will not deal with any new resolution that
contradicts what has been agreed upon with the U.N.
secretary-general," the government said in a brief announcement read
on Iraqi radio. "American officials are trying ... to issue new, bad
resolutions from the Security Council," the statement added.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's move appeared to be an attempt to undermine a sweeping
and tough new U.N. resolution that is expected to be circulated
Monday at the Security Council by the United States and Britain, U.N.
diplomats said Saturday. That resolution would charge U.N. teams with
checking any and all sites suspected of having information on
nuclear, biological or chemical weapons and ballistic missiles. It
would also, in effect, scrap any past compromises.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi statement referred particularly to a 1998 agreement
between Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Iraq's
sprawling presidential compounds, which have many facilities besides
Hussein's personal palaces.</TE>
<TE>   For seven years, Baghdad refused entry to the facilities on the
grounds that such inspections would infringe on Iraq's sovereignty. A
compromise in 1998 gave inspectors access, but only if they were
accompanied by an array of diplomats--a deal that prolonged the
process and gave Iraq a new channel of appeal, according to former
weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Saturday that Baghdad's
latest ploy was not unexpected. "Anyone who has watched the past
decade has seen the Iraqi government ... change their position
depending on what they thought was tactically advantageous to them
and kind of jerk the United Nations around," he said in an interview
on CNN. "So it is no surprise at all."</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi move could boost U.S. efforts at winning congressional
support for a resolution authorizing the use of force, if necessary,
to confront Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam thinks he can go back to where we left off, to when he was
still setting the rules of the game. But there's no tolerance for
that in this administration--and he doesn't get it," said Judith
Yaphe, an Iraq expert and former intelligence analyst now at National
Defense University in Washington. "He won a lot of support last week
when he agreed to allow the weapons inspectors to return. Now he's
lost the advantage he gained."</TE>
<TE>   But the United States and Britain are still facing an uphill
battle at the United Nations, where there are growing indications
that the Bush administration may have to settle for two resolutions:
one outlining the specific terms for Iraqi compliance in giving up
its deadliest arms and the second on the consequences if Baghdad
balks.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, which has veto power at the Security Council, appears to
be coming around to supporting a resolution after questioning last
week whether one was necessary, U.N. diplomats said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not there yet, but we're headed in the right direction,"
said a State Department official who requested anonymity after White
House talks with Russian leaders Friday.</TE>
<TE>   And a British diplomat said Saturday that none of the 15 nations
on the Security Council are now opposed to a strict resolution on
arms inspections.</TE>
<TE>   But France, which also has a veto, does not want the use of force
or the consequences of noncompliance in any initial resolution. Many
Arab countries and other Security Council members, which do not have
veto power but could form an important bloc, also favor separating
the issue of military action from the inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "We favor a two-step process because we want the strongest
international support to whatever decision is taken by the Security
Council, so that the international community is not divided and so
Saddam Hussein does not believe he can rely on any country to help
him delay. He must feel that at every step the world is united," said
a French diplomat who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Although the United States and Britain still intend to introduce a
single resolution, a British envoy said Saturday that "the threat
part of the resolution--the 'or else' clause--will be the hardest
part" to negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   From the U.S. perspective, the real catch is the timing of the
resolutions. The French and others do not want a second resolution
taken to the floor until Iraq is judged to be in violation, which
could be months down the road.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be easier to get world support if we first urge the Iraqi
regime to disarm and, if the regime does not comply, then to think of
the consequences," the French envoy said.</TE>
<TE>   But Washington fears that the Iraqis will merely procrastinate
without the threat of force hanging over their heads, a situation
that could both prolong the process of disarmament and defer the
prospects of military intervention.</TE>
<TE>   "Baghdad's decision to allow weapons inspectors back after
President Bush's speech proves once again that the Iraqis only act
when they have a gun to their heads. Without a strong message about
the risks it faces for noncompliance in one resolution, the U.N.
risks being messed around yet again," the British diplomat said.</TE>

<HD>Protestants May Split Belfast Coalition</HD>
<DH>N. Ireland: The Ulster Unionists say the IRA must renounce
violence to maintain government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BELFAST, Northern Ireland</DL>
<LD>The major Protestant party here announced Saturday that it will shut
down the joint Catholic-Protestant government--the central
achievement of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement--if the Irish
Republican Army doesn't demonstrate within four months that it has
renounced violence.</LD>
<LD>   First Minister David Trimble, boxed into a corner by the hard-line
wing of his Ulster Unionist Party, said he will immediately withdraw
from some power-sharing bodies with Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the IRA.</LD>
<LD>   He also said he will order his party out of government entirely in
January if its concerns about violence and lack of progress in the
peace process are not addressed.</LD>
<TE>   Trimble said he had agreed to the tough stance after what he
called an "appalling" summer of violence in Belfast, which he said
was orchestrated in part by Sinn Fein. He made the announcement at a
news conference with Jeffrey Donaldson, his main hard-line critic
within the party.</TE>
<TE>   Unionists say they have yet to see a "peace dividend" while
alleging that republican hard-liners, led by Sinn Fein, continue to
engage in paramilitary activity in the British province--an
allegation that Sinn Fein denies.</TE>
<TE>   Sinn Fein and the moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party
criticized Trimble's move as likely to collapse their shared
government.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's victory for the [anti-Good Friday] camp will not deter us
and will not stop the process of change," said Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams.</TE>

<HD>270 Slain as Ivorian Uprising Continues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>Troops loyal to Ivory Coast's president raced northward Saturday to
oust rebels from at least two major cities, as state TV said about
270 people had been killed in a 3-day-old uprising.</LD>
<LD>   Prime Minister Affi N'Guessan said a government offensive was
imminent. "Our forces are on the move, and we hope in the coming
hours that we will see the results on the ground," he told state
radio.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, rebels were in control of the northern opposition
stronghold of Korhogo and the central town of Bouake, 220 miles north
of Abidjan, the commercial capital. President Laurent Gbagbo pledged
a full-scale battle to remove them, but there were reports that the
rebels were widening their power base.</LD>
<TE>   A security official in neighboring Burkina Faso, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said rebels had taken control of other
northern cities, including Katiola, Ferkessedougou and
Ouangolodougou, on the border with Burkina Faso. It was not
immediately possible to verify the claim.</TE>
<TE>   Ivory Coast state television said 270 people had been killed and
300 injured in fighting since a failed coup Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In Abidjan, paramilitary police set fire to a mainly Muslim
neighborhood near the scene of fighting Thursday, raising fears that
the latest bloodletting was unleashing deadly ethnic, political and
religious hatreds in what was once one of West Africa's most stable
and prosperous nations.</TE>
<TE>   Frightened residents--many of them workers from Burkina Faso and
other Muslim countries who are frequent targets of attacks in Ivory
Coast's predominantly Christian south--said paramilitary police were
setting fire to their shacks, beating the occupants and leading them
away.</TE>
<TE>   Despairing residents of the burning Agban district sat with
belongings piled beside them as flames destroyed their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents said the paramilitary police had said they needed
to clear the area because rebels had taken refuge there.</TE>
<TE>   Western embassies warned of gangs of government supporters armed
with machetes roaming the streets of Abidjan.</TE>
<TE>   Ivory Coast's plummet into chaos began before dawn Thursday.
Insurgents, apparently including hundreds of recently sacked
soldiers, launched coordinated attacks on military installations,
government sites and Cabinet ministers' homes.</TE>
<TE>   Loyalist forces quelled the uprising in Abidjan after 12 hours of
fighting that left scores dead on the government side.</TE>
<TE>   Paramilitary police shot and killed the deposed junta chief whom
the government accuses in the coup attempt, Gen. Robert Guei, as well
as his wife, son and grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Candidate Survives Attack in Kashmir</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>Jammu and Kashmir state's tourism minister survived an assassination
attempt and at least 14 people were killed Saturday in a surge of
violence ahead of elections, Indian police said.</LD>
<LD>   Sakina Itoo, tourism minister and a ruling-party candidate in
state legislative elections, was on her way to a campaign stop south
of the state's summer capital, Srinagar, when her motorcade was hit
by a remote-controlled bomb. Gunmen surrounded her car and opened
fire, killing two bodyguards and a local resident, but Itoo survived,
a police spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second attack on Itoo in less than a week, and came
amid a spate of violence authorities blamed on Islamic separatists
who have vowed to disrupt legislative elections in India's only
majority-Muslim state. She also survived a Sept. 15 attack on her
motorcade.</LD>
<TE>   Kashmiris go to the polls Tuesday for the second of four rounds of
voting in September and October. India sees elections as a chance to
defuse a separatist insurgency in Kashmir, but militants call the
voting a sham.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the attack on Itoo, a worker with her National
Conference party was killed in his home outside Srinagar.</TE>
<TE>   In Kulgam, unidentified assailants gunned down a truck driver and
his assistant. In nearby Badijalan, four suspected members of an
outlawed Islamic militant group were killed in a gun battle with the
army, a Defense Ministry official said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, two suspected Islamic militants burst into an apartment
complex for police families in a Srinagar suburb, killing one
officer. Three other killings took place in Palpora and in Neelu.</TE>
<TE>   India accuses Pakistan of training Islamic insurgents who slip
across the border to attack Indian government targets. Islamabad
denies the charge, saying it provides only moral and diplomatic
support.</TE>

<LD>Six lawmakers from South Korea held a meeting Saturday with the
president of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, news reports
from both nations said.</LD>
<LD>   North Korea said the meeting with Kim Yong Nam was held in
Pyongyang, the North's capital. South Korea's Yonhap news agency said
it was the first meeting among assemblymen from the two countries
since the 1950-53 Korean War.</LD>
<LD>   The delegation came to the communist North with the symphony
orchestra of South Korea's state-run broadcasting system amid signs
of improvement in inter-Korean relations.</LD>
<TE>   "They had a conversation in an atmosphere overflowing with
compatriotic feelings," the North's official Korean Central News
Agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Yonhap said the delegation, led by Kim Thae Sik, deputy speaker of
South Korea's National Assembly, discussed plans to resume talks
between South and North lawmakers, political issues and cultural
exchanges. The six-member group will end a seven-day trip to the
North today, Yonhap said.</TE>

<HD>Fenced-In Arafat Finds Few Allies Outside</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinian appeals to world leaders, but the
response is discouraging. Soldiers hoist the Israeli flag over his
destroyed compound.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Trapped and surrounded, his water supply dwindling and his
headquarters reduced largely to rubble, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat appealed to the international community Saturday to press for
a halt to an Israeli offensive that has threatened not only his
authority but the very walls around him.</LD>
<LD>   As the blast of artillery shells gave way to the drone of Israeli
bulldozers outside the office building where he and about 200 others
were fenced in, Arafat spent the day talking to diplomats and world
leaders, urging them to rein in Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</LD>
<LD>   But top Palestinian officials said the response was discouraging,
and a spokesman for Sharon said the prime minister had no intention
of bowing to pressure in his campaign to isolate Arafat.</LD>
<TE>   "We stated this very clearly," said the spokesman, Raanan Gissin.
"We have an intention to isolate Arafat--and to bring about the
extradition of those terrorists who are wanted and who found
sanctuary in his compound. This operation will continue as long as
necessary."</TE>
<TE>   In a forceful display of that resolve, Israeli soldiers Saturday
took down a Palestinian flag flying above the compound and replaced
it with the Israeli flag.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the day, sources inside the compound said, Israeli troops
broadcast an order for the Palestinians to evacuate, warning that
large gas tanks in the wreckage of an adjoining building were in
danger of exploding. An army spokeswoman said she was unaware of any
such danger but acknowledged that the military was trying to get
everyone out of the building.</TE>
<TE>   Israel insists that it has no intention of harming Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after midnight, a wave of demonstrations swept through
West Bank cities despite a military curfew. In Ramallah, about 200
residents, drawn by appeals broadcast from mosques, began marching
toward Arafat's compound. In dispersing the demonstrators, Israeli
troops killed four people: two in Ramallah, one in Nablus and one in
Tulkarm, according to hospital officials. A Palestinian radio
reporter was among the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Israel launched the assault on the Palestinian Authority
president's compound Thursday within hours of a suicide bombing in
Tel Aviv that left six civilians dead. Tanks surrounded the fenced-in
complex, which had been heavily damaged in earlier attacks, and began
blowing up and razing virtually every remaining structure but
Arafat's executive office building.</TE>
<TE>   By Saturday morning, the shelling had stopped and the Israelis
were engaged in demolition cleanup. A Palestinian flag flew above
Arafat's office window, but the view took in bonfires, piles of
rubble and well-armed units of the two Israeli battalions deployed in
the siege.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli authorities estimated that of those holed up with Arafat,
20 or more were wanted by Israel for alleged terrorist acts. They
included Tawfiq Tirawi, the Palestinian intelligence chief in the
West Bank, who Palestinians confirmed was inside the building. Among
the others, the authorities said, were the commander of the
presidential guard, Mahmoud Damra, and Khaled Shawish, a senior
member of the guard.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-eight people surrendered to Israeli soldiers Friday and
early Saturday, but a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said
none of them was on the wanted list.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them have been released, [and] the rest are going to be
released," said the spokesman, Capt. Jacob Dalal.</TE>
<TE>   However, Dalal said the Israelis had underestimated the number of
wanted fugitives inside the compound. As of Saturday, they believed
that there were an undetermined number more than the 19 originally
thought to be inside.</TE>
<TE>   "It turns out that this compound has become a haven for
terrorists," Dalal said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians scoffed at such assertions and said Israel had not
handed over any list of the people it was seeking, although some
names had been mentioned publicly. Palestinian leaders said they
believed that the demand was a pretext for assaulting the
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, who is no stranger to living under siege, was reported to
have spent Saturday juggling routine chores and taking calls from
aides and foreign leaders. Among those who called, according to
spokesman Nabil abu Rudaineh, were Russian Foreign Minister Igor S.
Ivanov, Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa and Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat was, by several accounts, in good spirits, despite being
surrounded by his longtime foe. In addition to tearing down all of
the buildings around Arafat's, the Israelis destroyed the stairwell
in his building, leaving him unable to leave the second floor.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, he has high morale," said Ghassan Khatib, the
Palestinian labor minister, who spent the first day of the siege in
the compound with Arafat and had kept in close touch with him by
telephone since. "Because, you know, with a person such as Arafat,
with all the experiences he's had--he's not panicked at all."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Khatib and Abu Rudaineh said conditions in the compound
were not pleasant. With everyone concentrated in the single
structure, it had become uncomfortably crowded. And Abu Rudaineh said
Israeli troops destroyed water tanks Saturday, leaving the building
without running water. He said he was not sure how much food and
bottled water was left.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Israel planned to resupply the Palestinians, Dalal said,
"At the moment, we're not planning to starve them out--but there is
an intention to put them under pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian leaders issued a statement Saturday that they said was
endorsed by Arafat, although portions sounded as if they were coming
directly from him. Veering from the third to the first person, it
reiterated a call to Palestinians to halt attacks inside Israel but
also sounded a note of defiance.</TE>
<TE>   "We are ready for peace but not for capitulation," the statement
read, "and we will not give up Jerusalem or a grain of our soil,
which are guaranteed to us by international law.</TE>
<TE>   "I reiterate my call to the Palestinian people and all our parties
to halt any violent attacks inside Israel," it continued, "because
Sharon exploits them as an excuse to harm our people and to turn
Israeli and international public opinion against us. They do this to
implement their conspiratorial plan against the peace of the brave."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has said Arafat's words are hollow because the Palestinian
has been unable or unwilling to stop attacks on Israeli civilians
such as Thursday's bus bombing in Tel Aviv. Arafat has said he cannot
crack down on Palestinian extremists when he is under military
occupation, not to mention siege.</TE>
<TE>   The current standoff has made the possibility of peace talks
between the two sides increasingly remote. The West Bank is under
military occupation, with a strict curfew in most cities, including
Ramallah. Despite the Israeli crackdown, Palestinian extremists
carried out two suicide bombings in Israel last week.</TE>
<TE>   Khatib said Arafat had been encouraged by "promises from the White
House to intervene with the Israelis." But he said he saw little
evidence of strong global support. He said that Arafat was damaged by
President Bush's call earlier this year for a change in the
Palestinian leadership and that the international community is too
focused on Iraq to pay attention to the Israeli-Palestinian issue
now.</TE>
<TE>   Like Khatib, top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat spent Saturday
making urgent calls to diplomats, asking that they exert pressure on
Sharon to pull back. But he said he saw little evidence that his
pleas would be answered. Gissin, Sharon's spokesman, acknowledged
that there had been some calls urging restraint.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been a lot of world leaders calling, concerned about
Arafat," he said, his tone contemptuous. "I haven't heard one world
leader calling to show concern over these poor victims in Tel Aviv."</TE>

<HD>Saudis Say the U.S., Not Iraq, Threatens Stability</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Many believe Saddam Hussein has been subdued by
his military defeats but would be provoked by an invasion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia</DL>
<LD>This longtime ally of America isn't convinced that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein poses a serious and imminent military threat to
regional stability and security. That threat, Saudi Arabia believes,
comes from another source: the United States, top officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Many here believe that Hussein has been chastened by his military
failures and is unlikely to wage war on his neighbors--unless the
U.S. decides to invade.</LD>
<LD>   "The U.S. may know something about the existence of chemical
weapons in Iraq, but we are not sure," said the nation's longtime
security chief, Interior Minister Prince Nayif ibn Abdulaziz, adding
that a U.S. attack on Iraq would create problems in the region
"faster than any Iraqi operation against its neighbors."</LD>
<TE>   For more than 70 years, Saudi Arabia and the United States have
had close ties, a marriage of convenience that has served their
mutual political and strategic interests. But relations have been
strained since the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S., and the priorities
of both countries have diverged.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government wants Hussein ousted. The Saudi leadership
wants the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolved first. Neither side
has been willing to budge.</TE>
<TE>   Against this backdrop, the White House faces the prospect of
waging a major military campaign in the Persian Gulf region without
the key strategic support of Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   "The Saudis don't regard Saddam as a military threat," said a
high-level Western diplomat based here in Riyadh, the capital. "For
the Saudis, he is a political threat. The Saudis fear U.S. military
action will not only divert attention and break up a coalition to
fight terrorism but will also foster terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Saudi government has been very clear. If the U.S. goes
it alone, without the endorsement of the United Nations, the Saudi
government will refuse to allow the use of its territory.</TE>
<TE>   When authorities said recently that they would allow U.S. forces
to operate here if there is a U.N. resolution, observers say, the
goal was to thwart a war by pressuring Hussein to let in weapons
inspectors. It was not meant as a nod to the U.S. agenda, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that will avoid military operations against Iraq, or
military operations in the region, will be a positive act," Nayif
said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   This reluctance to attack Iraq reflects the significant
differences between what is happening today and what occurred in
1990, when Hussein invaded Kuwait and the entire area felt threatened
by the region's largest armed force.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 posed the gravest
threat to Saudi Arabia's security that I had yet encountered in my
military career," Prince Khaled bin Sultan wrote in "Desert Warrior:
A Personal View of the Gulf War by the Joint Forces Commander." "Our
vital oil-producing Eastern province--the principal source of our
national wealth--lay open to his mechanized and armored divisions."</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia is a large land mass, with a relatively small
population living on top of a valuable resource: one-fourth of the
world's known oil reserves. It is surrounded by unpredictable
neighbors, such as Iraq and Iran, and its leadership strives to
preserve credibility in a nation that has blended political and
religious authority. An alliance with the United States has helped
the Saud dynasty maintain the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   For these reasons, Saudi Arabia continues to allow the U.S. to fly
military patrols over a "no-fly" zone set up in southern Iraq after
the 1991 Persian Gulf War and allowed America to use a high-tech
command center to run the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Although the United States has moved thousands of its troops out
of the kingdom, about 5,000 U.S. military personnel remain in Saudi
Arabia, as well as the command center, which could be quietly used in
an Iraqi operation.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, officials, diplomats and political observers say
there is no fear that Baghdad will attack any neighbor. But there is
a fear that if the U.S. strikes, Hussein could lash out, perhaps
targeting the oil fields.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials in the region are paying close attention to what
the Saudi government is saying, although they say there is no sign
that it is wavering in its opposition to a war. Saudi Arabia's
leadership has a reputation of choosing its words carefully and
rarely being duplicitous.</TE>
<TE>   "They conceivably could have a powerful role if they offered
facilities to support some sort of response to Iraq's flouting of
U.N. resolutions," said a high-level U.S. diplomat from the region.
"It would be practically very important--plus, it would be a huge
signal throughout the Arab world."</TE>
<TE>   Even during the Gulf War there were elements of concern, ideas
that today have come to define the national policy. Some Saudi
leaders didn't like the idea of Arabs fighting Arabs, and they
worried that an invasion of Iraq could have negative consequences for
the rest of the region.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fear is that a defeat will be inflicted on them, dividing and
scattering their ranks and fragmenting their unity into ethnic
groups," Crown Prince Abdullah was quoted as saying in Joseph
Kechichian's book "Succession in Saudi Arabia."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, almost everyone, including Abdullah and the nation's
top religious leaders, accepted the idea of allowing foreign forces
to join a military coalition based on the Arabian peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   The war was successful, Hussein's military was defeated, and, for
a short time, Saudis thanked America for its help.</TE>
<TE>   But the anti-American sentiment started with a growing sense of
embarrassment among Saudis who questioned why they could not defend
themselves--especially after their leaders had spent hundreds of
millions of dollars on weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The hostility was stoked by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In
the early days of the current Bush administration, in particular, the
government here grew incensed at the White House's hands-off policy.</TE>
<TE>   But as important as the Palestinian issue is to the Saudis,
nothing has set back relations as drastically as the Sept. 11
attacks. Americans may feel that they have been double-dealt by the
Saudis' conservative religious system, but the Saudis feel that their
faith and culture have been demonized by the secular West.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a bad marriage. Neither one of us are listening to each
other. And no one is taking the other seriously," said the Western
diplomat based here. "We see each other as the problem."</TE>
<TE>   This presents more than a public relations challenge. The
leadership in each country finds itself under increasing pressure to
redefine relations with the other.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the Saudi government has tried to tone
down the outward expression of anti-American sentiment in the
kingdom, and to some extent it has succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   But it has done little to extinguish those feelings--and has been
careful not to offend religious conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   "You are an American, you are a terrorist," said Ahmed, a farmer
in the central province of Qassim, a poor religious and independent
agricultural area that has presented the regime with some of its most
vociferous religious critics. "We call you to be Muslims, to be
brothers. Instead, you fight the whole world."</TE>
<TE>   Over and over, in interviews in cafes and university offices, in
the poorest neighborhoods and the highest levels of government,
Saudis expressed a belief that they are victims of America's
misdirected anger.</TE>
<TE>   "Concerning the relationship, there are no changes accorded from
our side," said Saleh ibn Humaid, who chairs the Shura Council, an
appointed consultative body. "The U.S. is fully responsible [for a
worsening of relations] for one reason: If, after the 11th of
September, some Saudi names appeared in this case, it should have
been treated like individuals, but not by accusing the government."</TE>
<TE>   Many people here believe that America has targeted their religion.</TE>
<TE>   Because Saudi Arabia is an Islamic state, with the Koran as its
constitution and religious law, called Sharia, as its guide,
criticism of any aspect of the way people here live is seen as a
criticism of their faith.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of charity is an example. U.S. investigators have said
that Saudis--individually and through the government--gave millions
of dollars to charitable organizations that, in some cases, then
funneled the money to terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Many Saudis see the U.S. finger-pointing as a criticism of one of
the five pillars of Islam: charity.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, many Saudis used to give to charity--never, never ever for
[Osama] bin Laden or Al Qaeda or any terrorist organization," said
Mohammad bin Saad al Salam, president of Imam Muhammad bin Saud
Islamic University in Riyadh.</TE>
<TE>   "You give your contributions [and] you are limited about what you
know about this. To perform Islam you have to give--it's your
responsibility. You are not a Muslim if you don't do that."</TE>
<TE>   The gap in understanding is so great that Interior Minister Nayif,
while emphasizing how strongly his nation condemned the Sept. 11
attacks, insisted that there is no credible evidence that Bin Laden
or the 19 suspected hijackers either planned or carried out the
attacks. And he said that if they did do it, some other organization
was behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I think Al Qaeda is not qualified and doesn't have
the ability to do such a big and criminal action such as happened in
the Sept. 11 attack," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In any case, we cannot say for sure. They claim that they did it.
At the same time, maybe they were an agent for those people who asked
them to do it, or those people who are really behind it."</TE>
<TE>   Although Nayif's conspiracy ideas are popular, they are not
universal. There are others who believe that Bin Laden was
responsible and that he has achieved one of his main goals: driving a
wedge between Saudi Arabia and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "He succeeded, really," said Salam, the university president. "We
never dreamed we would be treated like an enemy of the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   This sense of distrust, and the widespread feeling of
victimization, plays a role in what course of action the Saudi
government will play if the United States asks for help with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "People here don't trust America," said a prominent religious
leader, Sheik Salman al Odah. "They think America is a real danger."</TE>

<HD>Good Showing for Western Favorites in Slovakia Polls</HD>
<DH>Elections: Initial returns make European Union and NATO
acceptance appear more likely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BRATISLAVA, Slovakia</DL>
<LD>In a major boost to Slovakia's bids for membership in NATO and the
European Union, preliminary results of parliamentary elections showed
Saturday that parties viewed favorably by the West will be positioned
to form the next government.</LD>
<LD>   Diplomats from North Atlantic Treaty Organization and EU countries
had repeatedly warned over the last year that if former Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar was returned to power by the elections held
Friday and Saturday, this country's prospects for joining those
organizations would be held up. Meciar's heavy-handed rule in the
mid-1990s badly strained Slovakia's ties with both the United States
and the European Union.</LD>
<LD>   Now the path appears clear for Slovakia to be among as many as
seven nations expected to receive NATO membership invitations at a
November summit in the Czech Republic. Slovakia's chances of being
part of an eastward expansion of the European Union in 2004 or 2005
also are greatly strengthened.</LD>
<TE>   "People understood it's a very serious election, that the whole
direction of the country is being decided," Prime Minister Mikulas
Dzurinda said late Saturday. Exit polls projected that if four
center-right parties form a coalition, they could control about 80
seats in the 150-seat parliament and reelect Dzurinda as prime
minister.</TE>
<TE>   Another possibility is that three or four of the center-right
parties would join with the populist SMER party, headed by Robert
Fico, to command a larger parliamentary majority. SMER was projected
to win about 25 to 29 seats, and Fico is considered a leading
candidate for prime minister if his party joins the government.</TE>
<TE>   Fico favors NATO and EU membership and a crackdown on corruption,
but in many ways his politics are not clearly defined. His critics
fear that, like Meciar, he might have authoritarian tendencies, but
he is seen as acceptable to the West.</TE>
<TE>   While official vote counts will not be released until today and
the exit polls could not give precise seat totals, top politicians
Saturday treated the surveys as generally reflecting the election
results.</TE>
<TE>   In both of the major polls, Meciar's Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia placed first, with a projected 31 seats. All other parties,
however, said they would not join him to form a government.</TE>
<TE>   Early this year, opinion polls showed Meciar's party drawing
greater public support than all four center-right parties and SMER
combined.</TE>
<TE>   Slovakia, formed out of the 1993 breakup of Czechoslovakia, was
refused entry into NATO in 1999 during the alliance's first round of
expansion to formerly Communist countries. The decision was based
largely on the judgment that the nation under Meciar had not been
sufficiently democratic.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats have regularly issued warnings that Meciar is
still internationally unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "The outcome of the election will decide whether the country can
accomplish what it wants to accomplish--full membership of the EU and
full integration with the Euro-Atlantic structures," Guenter
Verheugen, the EU commissioner for enlargement, said recently. The
statement was widely understood as a warning of the consequences of a
Meciar victory.</TE>
<TE>   Meciar supporters resent the West's pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a Slovak, and I support Meciar because I think he's such a
brain, and I think he's got the ability to take this republic out of
this mess we're in," a female pensioner who was willing to give only
her first name, Imelda, said Saturday. "I don't know why these people
in the West don't like him and why they don't try to find out why
Slovaks like him."</TE>
<TE>   Meciar played a key role in promoting the peaceful division of
Czechoslovakia, and in Slovakia he is viewed by supporters as the
father of the country. But critics charge that he ran an
authoritarian political machine based on patronage, corruption and
disrespect for democratic rules.</TE>
<TE>   Many anti-Meciar voters are sympathetic to the West's stance.</TE>
<TE>   "If Meciar were to be the top politician, it would be a shame for
all of Slovakia, because he acts like a boor," said Frantisek Belyus,
57, a computer software technician.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats "are right" to warn against Meciar, said Branko
Bubela, 30, a musician. "It's difficult to pinpoint, but I think
Meciar and Fico have in mind a more dictatorial regime."</TE>
<TE>   It now appears almost certain that at the November NATO summit in
Prague, the Czech capital, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovenia and
Slovakia will be invited to join. Romania and Bulgaria are also
widely seen as having strong chances of winning membership.</TE>
<TE>   Most countries in the former Soviet bloc desire NATO membership
not just to ensure their security but also as a badge of acceptance
into Europe, to impress foreign investors and to serve as a
steppingstone to joining the European Union.</TE>

<HD>Timoney Has Made a Career of Cleaning Up Police Messes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>First of three candidate profiles</SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>John F. Timoney is miserable.</LD>
<LD>   He has a retired cop's dream job--a quarter-million-dollar salary
and a 35th-floor Manhattan office overlooking the pulsing streets
where his exploits as a patrol officer and administrator made him a
New York Police Department legend. And he is a celebrity in his
adopted hometown of Philadelphia, where he served as police
commissioner for four years, acclaimed for shaking up a hidebound
department and personally collaring crime suspects while speeding
around town on his racing bicycle.</LD>
<LD>   But John Timoney is lost without the daily blood-churning stress
of running a big-city police force, just another forlorn civilian in
a suit since he resigned from his Philadelphia post a year ago to
manage a private-sector New York security firm. "I miss the phone
calls at 3 o'clock in the morning," he admitted in an interview last
week. " 'Commissioner, we've got a problem--we shot the wrong guy.' I
miss being part of the action."</LD>
<TE>   Timoney, 54, has made a career of taking on messes that police
executives dread. One of three finalists for Los Angeles' next police
chief selected last week by the city's Police Commission, Timoney
straddles clashing extremes in American law enforcement. He is an
ardent advocate of coalition building and civilian participation in
policing who thinks and reacts like an old-line beat cop. Timoney's
agility at melding those impulses has won plaudits from tough-justice
advocates and reformers alike, but a stubborn streak and candor
bordering on recklessness have repeatedly dimmed his brilliant
career.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, Timoney rose in a sweeping trajectory that took him
from South Bronx patrolman in the 1970s to the top deputy's post in
the 1990s under Commissioner William Bratton, now a rival for the
LAPD job. A clenched-faced athlete whose dense brogue betrays his
roots as an Irish immigrant, Timoney became the starched uniform to
Bratton's pinstripes. He implemented and cheer-led Bratton's
computer-based reforms, unleashing New York beat cops to reverse
years of spiraling crime. Then, chosen as Philadelphia's police
commissioner by Mayor Ed Rendell, Timoney was both tireless advocate
and scourge for that city's crisis-weary force.</TE>
<TE>   Driven, impulsive, brutally frank, Timoney was revered for
reducing property crime in Philadelphia. He won admirers among
minority and political leaders and nimbly kept the peace with a
minimum of arrests and street violence when protests threatened the
Republican National Convention in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Commissioner Timoney is the real deal," said Philadelphia
Councilman Michael Nutter, who represents a heavily black electoral
district in West Philadelphia. "He understands the delicate nature of
politics, the needs of ethnic communities and how to size up a
situation and, in the end, do the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Timoney has also been his own worst enemy at times. He quit the
NYPD after he was passed over for the top job, an exit hastened when
he publicly disparaged then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as a "screw-up."
He served two mayors in Philadelphia but, after four years in the
limelight, the marathoner suddenly hit a wall.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney's police were unable to make significant reductions in the
sparring with a powerful police union and a skeptical press. He
resigned last year for undisclosed "personal reasons," months after
Philadelphia Mayor John Street told him to transfer a department
homicide supervisor who had been given a 20-day suspension for
crashing an unmarked police car after a night of drinking.</TE>
<TE>   His muted departure did not chip away at Timoney's stature in
Philadelphia, where he still lives in a rented apartment with his
wife, Noreen. They have two grown children. A year after leaving his
commissioner's post to manage the security firm on New York City's
East 42nd Street run by Beau Dietl, a former NYPD sergeant who once
worked under him, the restless Timoney is still acclaimed by
Philadelphians.</TE>
<TE>   At dawn, from the banks of the Schuylkill River, gawkers yell "Yo,
commissioner!" as Timoney rows by in his two-man scull, said his
rowing partner, Mark O'Connor. The jutting-jawed Timoney is still
such a public presence in town that a privately commissioned
political poll recently found that his name recognition rivals that
of most political figures in the city, including Street's.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his career, Timoney has prospered by projecting the
image of a tough but fair cop willing to join his street officers on
the dirtiest assignments--a "cop's cop," as one of his New York
literary circle friends, author Tom Wolfe, has called him. He is also
a street intellect, a self-taught bookworm who set up a reading club
for New York cops and lectured on Dostoevski's portrait of the
criminal mind. Every June 14, he recites passages from James Joyce's
"Ulysses" for "Bloomsday," the annual reenactment of the Irish
author's seminal work.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Timoney has shown up for roll calls at stationhouses on
lonely Christmases and other holidays.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the way he's always done it," said John Gallagher, a former
Harlem cop who now works for the Justice Department in New Mexico.
"He'd show up in Harlem at midnight on Christmas Eve and he'd tell
us, 'I know you gotta be out there, but the city's with you and so am
I.' You don't know what that means to a street officer."</TE>
<TE>   Timoney seemed to be everywhere at once in Philadelphia, on the
nightly news, scooting around the city with a squad of bike police.
His final act as commissioner last New Year's Eve, he recalls with a
snort, was arresting a gun-wielding suspect charged with attempted
murder.</TE>
<TE>   There is an element of calculation in his identification with
officers on the lowest rung, Timoney acknowledges, "but I'm serious
about it. I firmly believe I shouldn't ask them to do something I
don't want to do myself."</TE>
<TE>   Police training experts and academics who have long observed
Timoney say his ability to personify the street cop while
spearheading reforms would be key attributes in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "He lives and breathes the way street officers think," said Jack
Greene, dean of Northeastern University's College of Criminal
Justice, who has analyzed both the Philadelphia and Los Angeles
police reform efforts. "Given the police culture in L.A., there's a
real need for that."</TE>
<TE>   "But he also knows how to build coalitions with disparate interest
groups," Greene said. "New York, where he came up, is about as
complex as that gets, and Philadelphia gave him the opportunity to
put what he learned into practice."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials have privately described their keen interest
in Timoney as stemming from his reputation as a nationally recognized
law enforcement official. They are impressed by his reputation as a
public servant who is affable and approachable, willing to listen to
differing views and then implement far-reaching changes.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn's chief of staff, Tim McOsker, flew to
Philadelphia recently to meet with officials and activists who had
worked with Timoney. McOsker came away from the trip impressed by
raves from city leaders and community groups, according to several
people he later briefed.</TE>
<TE>   "Commissioner Timoney had great rapport with Philadelphia's ethnic
communities," said Frank Keel, a spokesman for Mayor Street. "He did
a great job in bridging the Police Department with the African
American community, the Latino community. He was tireless, he showed
up at every community forum you could imagine, and he had the good
sense to promote top-quality minority officers."</TE>
<TE>   But if Timoney was able to deftly knit alliances, he was less
successful in winning over his home base. Street cops give him only
lukewarm respect after his four-year stewardship.</TE>
<TE>   While several Philadelphia officers and other department insiders
interviewed recently said they had found some of Timoney's reforms
helpful, they also expressed resentment of what they saw as his
heavy-handed toughening of the department's Internal Affairs
investigations of police misconduct. Others said they had grown
disillusioned with Timoney's image as a "glory hound who traveled in
the black-tie set."</TE>
<TE>   "The rank and file felt he was becoming too big for his britches,"
said Ellen Ceisler, an independent civilian oversight official who
has tangled with Timoney at times, but also sees him as "just what
the LAPD needs."</TE>
<TE>   In South Philadelphia, near a baseball field where a scoreboard
bears the face and name of Daniel Faulkner, a lionized cop killed in
a notorious 1981 shootout with black activist Mumia Abu Jamal, a
balding police sergeant shrugged at the mention of his former boss.</TE>
<TE>   "He did some good things, yeah," said the sergeant, who declined
to give his name. "But not all of them worked. And he loved that
spotlight, more than he loved us, I'll say that."</TE>
<TE>   Grudging respect, Timoney said, is about the best a successful
police executive can expect from below while contending with the
treacherous cross-currents of public life.</TE>
<TE>   "You should respect a top cop, but not idolize him," Timoney said.
He said he often told officers "that your job is to go out and lock
up the bad guys, and my job is to keep you out of trouble. Sometimes
it's going to tick you off, but that's the way it's gotta be."</TE>
<TE>   Disillusionment spread, Timoney contends, as a result of his
bitter four-year war with the Fraternal Order of Police, a formidable
police union that represents almost every city officer up to the
highest ranks. The union successfully used a statewide arbitration
system to blunt Timoney's attempts to discipline officers as he saw
fit.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after arriving as commissioner in 1998, Timoney met with
union leaders in a series of private meetings aimed at compromises to
improve police education and streamline the handling of disciplinary
cases. But Timoney soon bridled at vitriolic union magazine "cheap
shots" that promised to send him "packing north of 95"--a reference
to the highway to New York.</TE>
<TE>   "He projects a great image to the community and he's got a lot of
good ideas, but he's weak on follow-through," said Richard Costello,
a Philadelphia police captain who is stepping down as union
president.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney is now blunt about his tangles with the union. "What I was
trying to do was to break up the union into separate unions," he
said, adding: "Of course they're going to resent that."</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner moved quickly in Philadelphia to shore up an
ineffective Internal Affairs unit. He promoted the use of anonymous
undercover officers to sniff out misconduct in the city's station
houses and ordered investigators to tape their interviews. He banned
cops from using blackjacks, a weapon prized by street officers since
the days of the late Frank Rizzo, the department's legendary
tough-guy commissioner who later served as mayor.</TE>
<TE>   But Timoney did not always welcome the efforts of others to help
clean up his department, said Ceisler. Timoney counters that his
efforts to satisfy a court-mandated federal consent decree showed his
willingness to open up his department to outsiders, satisfying both a
district court judge and impressing then-Atty. Gen. Janet Reno's
Justice Department regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be the same," he added, in contending with the
wide-reaching consent decree that governs many of the LAPD's
operations. "The thing is to get out of the consent decree by fixing
what's broken, reporting to the judge in objective fashion and
reducing the lawsuits and the settlement of those lawsuits."</TE>
<TE>   His efforts at straightening his own house appeared to be working
until Timoney was caught up in a mini-scandal in March 1998 over a
decision he had made early in his tenure. Timoney had suspended a
homicide captain, James J. Brady, for 20 days for driving drunk--a
fireable offense that had allegedly been covered up by another police
official.</TE>
<TE>   According to Keel, Mayor Street, when he learned of the matter,
was "not pleased by what he saw as a slap on the wrist. After strong
dialogue, Timoney stepped forward and did the right thing,"
transferring Brady out of homicide. Brady later resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney explained that his initial decision to merely suspend
Brady came during a period early in his tenure when he was confronted
by a huge backlog of disciplinary cases. He and his deputies had to
sift through "boxes and boxes" of 500 cases. "I didn't know Brady and
had no reason to protect him," Timoney said.</TE>
<TE>   Ceisler countered that many of the leftover files were "minor
cases for officers who had missed court. This was totally different
because it involved the most serious kind of case against a
high-ranking officer."</TE>
<TE>   After he was confronted by Street, Timoney changed his mind. He
insists the two men agreed in private and the mayor continued to back
him up despite press reports that Street had lost confidence in him.</TE>
<TE>   "When I made the decision I didn't think it was a bad decision,
and on reflection, I probably should have just fired the guy,"
Timoney now says.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe it damaged Timoney's credibility at City Hall,"
Keel said. "The general consensus was that he'd erred on the side of
protecting his fellow officer.... At his core, John Timoney's just a
cop. For this city, he was a great one."</TE>

<HD>U.S., Airlines Face Off Over $700 Million</HD>
<DH>Security: Firms want to cut their aviation protection
contribution from $1 billion to $300 million. Government threatens to
audit books.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When Congress approved a federal takeover of aviation security after
the Sept. 11 attacks, the airlines agreed to contribute what they
were already spending on security: $1 billion a year.</LD>
<LD>   Now that the Bush administration is trying to collect the money,
the airlines say they spent only $300 million a year when they were
running the system.</LD>
<LD>   The $700-million gap has prompted a testy confrontation between
industry lobbyists and the Transportation Department that could boil
over Tuesday at a House hearing on the airlines' financial troubles.</LD>
<TE>   Transportation Department Inspector General Kenneth Mead is
threatening to let his auditors loose on the air-carriers' books. The
industry, meanwhile, accuses the administration of trying to pick its
pockets even as several airlines are on the verge of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain: At more than $6 billion this year alone, the
cost of a federal aviation security system is greater than anyone
expected. A $1-billion airline contribution and the proceeds from a
new security fee paid by passengers would not cover even half the
costs.</TE>
<TE>   With passengers ponying up as much as $10 per round trip in
federal security fees, an advocate for business travelers said the
government should not let the airlines wiggle out of their full
share.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't trust the numbers the airlines are putting forth,"
said Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition. "They
are trying to squeeze every single nickel they can from their
customers and shift every expense they possibly can to the
government."</TE>
<TE>   The betting in Congress is that the industry will get at least
some relief. "At the end of the day, why not pick a number in
between?" said a senior congressional aide. "I don't think either
side wants to fight an accounting war. Either the industry and the
department will reach a compromise, or Congress will solve it for
them."</TE>
<TE>   As the airlines plead with Congress for forbearance, they must
overcome a potential problem: a paper trail.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks before the terrorist attacks last year on New York
City and the Pentagon, the Air Transport Assn. wrote to congressional
investigators at the General Accounting Office to outline the extent
of the industry's spending on security. The lobbying group--the voice
of the industry in Washington--estimated annual security costs of $1
billion, including specific items such as $462 million for security
screening personnel and $50 million for technology.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the attacks, industry officials again cited the
$1-billion figure in congressional testimony.</TE>
<TE>   But this summer, the same airline group filed papers with the
Transportation Security Administration certifying that the industry
only spent $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   "This large difference is of concern to us," Mead wrote the Air
Transport Assn. on Sept. 13. "We believe it is in the best interest
of both the taxpayers and the airline industry that this disparity be
resolved and the accounting methods supporting these varying
estimates be explained."</TE>
<TE>   Mead added: "The airlines' independent accounting firms should be
prepared to document these amounts.... We plan to review the audit
work papers."</TE>
<TE>   Carol Hallett, head of the airline lobbying group, took umbrage at
the suggestion that the airlines had fudged the numbers. "I am
troubled at the various conclusions you appear to have drawn," she
wrote Mead in a Sept. 18 letter.</TE>
<TE>   The $700-million discrepancy arose because of a mix of legitimate
factors, she said. These included accounting problems that made it
difficult to precisely determine what the airlines were paying and
questions about the specifics of what Congress intended when it
required them to keep contributing.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the absence of solid data, the lack of precision in
defining terms ... and lingering confusion over what, if anything, is
the correct figure, I am hard pressed to understand your apparent
belief that some figures are supportable and others are not," Hallett
wrote the inspector general.</TE>
<TE>   At least one attempt to break the impasse by bargaining has
failed. When the Transportation Department suggested $750 million,
the airlines came back with a $500-million counteroffer. They got no
takers.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, we do not see the basis for viewing the $500
million as credible nor supportable," said Mead, adding that $500
million is "half the amount represented [last year] in congressional
testimony, yet ironically, it is about $200 million more than the
amount the air carriers reported in their certified cost
submissions."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute has taken on added significance because the airlines
continue to pile up huge losses. Last year, they lost a record $7.7
billion, even after receiving about $4 billion from a government
bailout. Although Southwest Airlines Co. and a few other carriers
continue to be profitable, the industry expects to post a $6-billion
loss this year.</TE>

<HD>Meth Makers Target Farmers' Fertilizer</HD>
<DH>Crime: New York authorities are disturbed by the rise in
thefts of anhydrous ammonia, a volatile chemical used on corn and
soybean crops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VENICE CENTER, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Dale Parmley has lost count of how many times that thieves have crept
onto his 1,800-acre farm to rob him. You might think that he was
mining gold instead of growing corn and soybeans.</LD>
<LD>   The bandits are after anhydrous ammonia, a volatile liquid
fertilizer that can be used to produce methamphetamine.</LD>
<LD>   "They've hit my farm as many as three, four times in one week.
They just keep getting more bold," said Parmley, whose farm lies amid
the Finger Lakes in southern Cayuga County, 40 miles southwest of
Syracuse. "They caught one guy at my place. They put him in jail. He
got bailed out. He hit one of my neighbors on the way out of town."</LD>
<TE>   Cayuga County has become part of an illegal pipeline for an
unorganized group of modern-day bootleggers, most of whom run the
fertilizer from New York farms to meth labs in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 18 months, more than 200 anhydrous ammonia thefts have
been reported to Cayuga County sheriff's deputies, said Steve McLoud,
chief investigator. Since July 2001, there have been 32
arrests--three-fourths of them people from Pennsylvania, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Why New York? Many north-central Pennsylvania farms use other
types of fertilizers. They are also too small to risk storing
ammonia, which comes as a pressurized liquid and requires storage and
application equipment that can cost thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "What's really disturbing to us, though, is that if we are able to
apprehend that many people, how many others are out there doing the
same things that we're not catching?" McLoud said.</TE>
<TE>   The thefts have plagued the Midwest for years, where the use of
meth has spread "like a prairie wildfire" and become rural America's
No. 1 problem, according to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
chief Asa Hutchinson.</TE>
<TE>   According to a DEA survey, the number of people abusing the
drug--also known as speed, ice, crystal or crank--has tripled over
five years, to 9.4 million in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In Oklahoma, thieves were so persistent that farmers and
fertilizer dealers fought for and helped pass a law that carries a
maximum 15-year prison sentence and $25,000 fine for a person caught
destroying or attempting to destroy any liquid transportation tank.</TE>
<TE>   The thefts in New York so far have been mostly in Cayuga County.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] we have a lot of farmers around the state who grow corn,"
said Chris LaRoe, spokesman for the state Farm Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   LaRoe said New York needs tougher laws. Usually, local authorities
can charge thieves only with burglary or petit larceny, misdemeanors
that often draw penalties of less than a year in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Cayuga County Sheriff James Moochler said he's taking extra
measures and increasing patrols.</TE>
<TE>   "Like many police agencies, our resources are limited," Moochler
said. "These locations are all rural. We have a big county to cover
and it can be difficult. Plus, these people come late at night and
early in the morning, make their grab and take off. They're not
tourists. They don't spend a lot of time here."</TE>
<TE>   The thefts have so overwhelmed local authorities that Sen. Hillary
Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) has asked the FBI to get involved in the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The economics are enticing.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers buy anhydrous ammonia for less than $1 a gallon and
typically store thousands of gallons for use at the beginning of the
planting season. Supply wagons are parked overnight in dozens of
dark, remote fields.</TE>
<TE>   "Runners," as thieves are called, can get up to $250 a gallon.
Using coolers, propane tanks and empty soda syrup canisters, they
haul away several gallons at a time.</TE>
<TE>   With one gallon, a meth cook can make a few ounces of the drug,
worth about $2,000. The average homeowner would probably find most of
the ingredients for cooking meth--lithium batteries, matches, cold
medication and liquid solvents--in a kitchen junk drawer and medicine
cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   Anhydrous ammonia can be deadly. Federal regulations govern its
use, requiring specific procedures and equipment for handling.
Farmers use it as a fertilizer ingredient and know how to handle it
safely. Some, like Parmley, use tens of thousands of gallons during
planting season, storing it in 30,000-gallon railroad tanker cars and
transporting it to the field in 1,000-gallon "wagon" tanks.</TE>
<TE>   The pressurized liquid can produce more than 200 pounds of
pressure per square inch. It feels like minus 160 degrees on the
skin. It turns into a gas when exposed to air and, although it
evaporates quickly, can cause serious skin and respiratory burns and
even death if exposure is direct or prolonged.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently, the chemical ends up spilled or abandoned by the
thieves, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are dumping their waste in their backyards, along the side
of the road, wherever they feel they need to," said Mark Nemier, with
the DEA office in Syracuse.</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Donald said it "seems like just about every week" that
thieves hit the 1,300-acre farm he owns with his brother, Robert.</TE>
<TE>   The Donalds have reinforced valve coverings with steel and
installed heavy-duty locks that can't be broken with bolt cutters.
Other farmers have mislabeled their anhydrous ammonia tanks as
propane, installed barbed-wire fencing, and moved their tanks closer
to barns and homes.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing has worked.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just worried that they're going to get greedy and try to
steal a wagon out of a field. That would be real stupid and real
dangerous," Rodney Donald said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, there has been no violence, although several thieves have
been arrested carrying guns and knives. There have been two
high-speed chases with police, and frequent run-ins between
patrolling farmers and noisy thieves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only a matter of time," McLoud said. "I know farmers are
only looking to protect their property. But they don't know who or
what they are dealing with. You never know when one of these guys is
high on the stuff, and if he's armed, a farmer might get hurt. And
I'm just as worried about one of these farmers, in a fit of rage,
injuring or killing a suspect."</TE>
<TE>   Parmley, meanwhile, said he'll stop storing the chemical at his
farm and buy only what he needs when he needs it.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's see them steal what I ain't got," he said.</TE>

<HD>No Skeptics Here: Bigfoot Fans Gather to Swap Yarns, Catch
Up on the Latest About Sasquatch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JEANNETTE, Pa.</DL>
<LD>True believers in Bigfoot ignored a history of hoaxes and
misidentifications and gathered Saturday to exchange stories, peruse
books and view items on the creature, which is also known as
Sasquatch.</LD>
<LD>   About 120 people attended the fourth annual East Coast Bigfoot
Conference and Expo in this town outside Pittsburgh. Sale items
included plaster casts of footprints--some with five toes, some with
three.</LD>
<LD>   "There's just too much evidence collected, too many sightings, too
many reports for the creature not to exist," said Eric Altman of the
Pennsylvania Bigfoot Society.</LD>
<TE>   Altman does not claim to have seen a Bigfoot. However, while
investigating a report in the woods of Bradford County two years ago,
he and another researcher heard some sort of creature.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't see it, but we could hear it mumbling and
growling--almost like speaking," said Altman, 32, who installs
software for AT&amp;T. He said whatever it was crossed the trail about
100 yards ahead of them, just out of sight.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last three years, the society has investigated more than
50 Bigfoot reports in Pennsylvania. Although the Northwest is best
identified with Bigfoot, Altman said Pennsylvania ranks fourth among
states with more than 500 sightings dating to the 1800s.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Vinkler, 50, said she would have thought anyone claiming
to see a Bigfoot was crazy--until June 2000, when, she said, she saw
one while driving to work. "I was a skeptic, very much so."</TE>
<TE>   Others not at the expo said they simply haven't seen proof.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of evidence. The problem is it's not good
evidence," said Benjamin Radford, managing editor of "Skeptical
Inquirer," the magazine of the Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal.</TE>
<TE>   "People have always believed in the fantastic," said Barbara
Mikkelson, who runs the Urban Legends Reference Page on the Internet.
"We want to believe in a world where miracles can happen."</TE>

<LD>On the surface, the house built by Bruce Francisco in Saranac, N.Y.,
looks like a modest mountain chalet, with a wraparound porch and a
big sun room to take in the view. Then look at what lies below. A
heavy steel door opens to stairs descending into a cool, silent
habitat built within the cylindrical remains of a Cold War relic.</LD>
<LD>   Francisco and his cousin converted a former Atlas F missile silo
site into a luxury home. Now they're trying to sell it on eBay.</LD>
<LD>   Francisco said the silo is designed to withstand a nuclear impact,
making the home about as secure as one can get. And inside the
cylinder that once held a missile, the space is silent as a tomb.
"Nobody would have any trouble sleeping down here," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The silo home has been on the market for two years. Bidding on the
Web site, which ends Wednesday, starts at $2.1 million.</TE>

<LD>President Bush pressed Senate Democrats to meet the challenge of
terrorism by agreeing to his proposal for a Department of Homeland
Security that would have broad power to "move people and resources to
meet new threats."</LD>
<LD>   In his weekly radio address, Bush said the bill now before the
Senate was unacceptable and he favored a compromise by Sens. Phil
Gramm (R-Texas) and Zell Miller (D-Ga.). Bush said their measure
would meet his demands for flexibility while protecting the 170,000
federal workers expected to staff the new agency.</LD>
<LD>   The White House put new energy into a public relations and
lobbying campaign to influence the votes of a few senators said to
hold the key to establishing the Cabinet-level department on the
president's terms. One White House official said Bush is within a
single vote of success.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A rare eruption of the world's largest geyser is causing geologists
to take a closer look at the mysterious basin where it lies.</LD>
<LD>   Steamboat Geyser's eruption Sept. 13 was the second this year, but
only the fourth in 11 years.</LD>
<LD>   It has given a push to efforts by Yellowstone, U.S. Geological
Survey and University of Utah officials to install more research
instruments in the geyser's home, the Norris Basin, which is the
hottest and most rapidly changing in Yellowstone. It lies about 30
miles north of Old Faithful, which is part of the Upper Geyser Basin.</LD>
<TE>   Reports of Steamboat's eruptions date to 1878. The geyser, one of
10,000 geothermal features in Yellowstone, was dormant between 1911
and 1961. It erupted three times in 1989 and once in 1990, 1991 and
2000 before shooting off in April and September this year.</TE>

<HD>More Than Drought Harms Rangeland, Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Environment: Some federal managers blame livestock
overgrazing. Ranchers do not agree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TONTO NATIONAL FOREST, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>With a sweep of his arm, Eddie Alford takes in the lifeless tableau:
a gaunt landscape of withered shrubs, desiccated cactuses and bare
mounds where grasses once sprouted.</LD>
<LD>   Congress, the public and ranchers are quick to blame drought for
these conditions, which have forced the withdrawal of cattle herds
from nearly 70% of public grazing land in the Southwest, including
this starved stretch of Tonto National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   Alford, a biologist for the U.S. Forest Service, has a different
view. He believes that decades-old polices by agencies such as his,
as well as poor practices by ranchers themselves, have brought public
rangelands to this sorry shape.</LD>
<TE>   "We have some [ranchers] who have stocked 10 times the cattle ...
allowed on their permit," he said. "Our focus has always been to
support grazing at all costs. Now look. It doesn't take much of a
drought to make this country look bad if it's been managed poorly.
The southern part of the Tonto has never had a chance to recover
since the overgrazing of the late 1800s."</TE>
<TE>   Similar concerns have prompted normally circumspect career federal
managers to speak out. Dave Stewart, rangeland director for the
Forest Service in the Southwest, recently described conditions in New
Mexico's Santa Fe National Forest as "the most horrible example of
grazing administration I've ever experienced."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart said ranchers and land managers are responsible for the
range conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't say the problems we are having today are all because of
the drought. They are not. Certain management practices that were
considered OK 10 years ago are not OK now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Does it mean that the people out there operating the ranches are
bad people? Certainly not. But there are people who have not been
able to keep pace with the need for better management. This requires
intensive effort by ranchers. We have continuous grazing without the
ability to move the cattle around. That, over time, has a damaging
effect on the watershed and the land."</TE>
<TE>   Here in Arizona, in the national forest that officials say is the
hardest-hit by the drought, an unpre- cedented destocking is taking
place over 3 million acres. Virtually all cattle have been removed
from the forest and will remain off for at least a year, or until
Alford and others determine there is enough grass growth to support
cattle.</TE>
<TE>   Ranchers, who lease 270 million acres of land in the West, chafe
at accusations of overstocking and overgrazing. It is the prolonged
drought, they say, that's to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "The condition of the land is that it is in a drought--it has
nothing to do with management practices and nothing to do with things
that occurred 100 years ago," said Charles "Doc" Lane, a
fourth-generation rancher and director of natural resources for the
Arizona Cattlemen's Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians have responded by opening more public land to grazing
and by expanding federal assistance programs to ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the Bush administration approved grazing on tens of
thousands of acres enrolled in the government's Conservation Reserve
Program. The program sets aside agricultural land for use as wildlife
habitat. It also includes watersheds in need of restoration in seven
Western states. Congress is considering a legislative rider that
would exempt ranchers who lease public land from conforming to
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.</TE>
<TE>   In Arizona, ranchers received $2 million in drought aid from a
state fund intended to purchase land for open space. This month,
Congress approved a $6-billion emergency aid package for
drought-affected farmers and ranchers. And last week the Department
of Agriculture announced a $752-million package to aid affected
livestock producers.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation groups are accusing ranchers of leveraging the
drought to gain public funds to solve a problem they themselves
created. The groups cite $237 million in drought-related federal aid
doled out to cattle ranchers during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "In these intense periods of drought in the West, ranchers shift
from overgrazing the public lands to mining the public trough," said
John Horning, executive director of the New Mexico-based conservation
group Forest Guardians. "None of these conditions have come about
overnight. It's been 100 years of overgrazing."</TE>
<TE>   Government officials who supervise grazing on public land are
beginning to agree. Even though it can be politically dangerous for
them to say so, many are now conceding that unmanaged grazing might
have permanently altered the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Managing cattle responsibly can be a labor-intensive, highly
scientific endeavor. Environmentalists and government land stewards
say that many in the current generation of ranchers who use public
land can't or won't do the work required to protect the range.</TE>
<TE>   Often, the physical labor is too difficult, Stewart said, and some
ranchers simply don't agree with biologists who insist on
time-consuming cattle management to preserve the range.</TE>
<TE>   Cattle need to be moved from one pasture to another before they
can cause soil compaction. When that happens, rainfall can't
penetrate the dense topsoil and, instead of nourishing plants and
grass, the water rushes into streambeds.</TE>
<TE>   River corridors, called riparian areas, can be damaged by a herd
trampling through to reach water. Cattle often chew tufts of desert
grasses off at the nub, stressing the plant and slowing recovery and
regrowth.</TE>
<TE>   "I would argue that it's very difficult for any rancher, even the
best, not to have significant ecological impacts," said George
Weurthner, a former biologist for the Bureau of Land Management who
has just published a book highly critical of public land grazing.
"The drought exacerbates the land's natural limitations, which are
already marginal. It's all made worse by poor range management. Some
areas in the West can take 10 years to recover from one year of
normal grazing."</TE>
<TE>   Lane of the Arizona Cattlemen's Assn. said that although it's true
that most grazing allotments are brown and dry, there is still
sufficient food for smaller numbers of cattle.</TE>
<TE>   The ranchers who work this harsh land say they know best how to
handle it. Helen and Billy Martin, both 77, have been ranching in
this rugged part of central Arizona all their lives.</TE>
<TE>   They make the same argument most local ranchers do--that the range
has always looked this way.</TE>
<TE>   "The country is fine; this place looks the same as it did a
hundred years ago," Helen Martin said from her modest ranch near
Superior. "There used to be 2,500 head of cattle on this land. Now
there's all but none. Why? We aren't going to put them out there if
they are going to starve. How dumb do they think we are?"</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Martins had 300 head of cattle that they tended on
horseback, riding the 600 acres they lease in the national forest.
They are now down to 50 cows, which must be off by the end of the
month.</TE>
<TE>   It's a story being played out around the region, where land
managers predict that soon no private ranchers will be running cattle
on public land.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't continue on," Stewart said. "We have to destock these
ranches. There's virtually no forage to be grazed. It paints a pretty
bleak picture for the future."</TE>

<HD>NYC's Little Italy Lacks 1 Ingredient: Italians</HD>
<DH>Trends: As young people moved to the suburbs, the community
shrank. Now, most of the people in the historic area are Asian and
Latino.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>After 40 years, Lunella Russo has seen it all on Mulberry Street:
Boisterous festivals, like this weekend's Feast of San Gennaro, which
is expected to draw more than 2.5 million people. Booming real estate
values, which have turned Little Italy into one of the city's hottest
neighborhoods. Blood-curdling mob violence, both real and cinematic.</LD>
<LD>   But as the longtime restaurant owner scans the crowd for
prospective customers this year, she sounds a melancholy note: "Once
this place was home to so many Italians, and you knew it was a real
Italian neighborhood. But no more. Little Italy is not at all what it
was."</LD>
<LD>   Nowadays, most of the people who live in the historic community
just north of Canal Street are Asian and Latino. The cramped tenement
apartments that line the streets and were made famous in scenes from
"The Godfather" are home to a dwindling number of aging Italian
Americans.</LD>
<TE>   There's increasingly little that's truly Italian in New York's
Little Italy, and the same is true for once-thriving ethnic enclaves
in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, New Orleans, San Francisco and
Newark, N.J. As young Italian Americans moved to new homes in the
suburbs, the old neighborhoods shrank and, like Mulberry Street,
became ethnic theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   Some bemoan this trend, yet the differences between then and now
may be academic to many of those pouring into Mulberry Street for
this year's 75th annual Feast of San Gennaro, the nation's largest
Italian street fair.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors from throughout the New York metropolitan area and other
states have been feasting on platters of calamari and scungilli,
testing their skills at carnival games, paying respects at local
churches, shopping for pottery bargains in bric-a-brac shops and
trying on "The Sopranos" T-shirts. It's a noisy 11-day party and the
religious event that inspired it--the martyrdom of St. Gennaro,
Naples' patron saint, in 305--seems light-years away.</TE>
<TE>   "We come down here every year and have a ball," said Frank
Marinello, wolfing down a sausage and pepper sandwich and eyeing the
plate of sugarcoated zeppole in his wife's hands. Marinello's family
moved out of Little Italy years ago, scattering to Long Island, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. "This festival," he said, "is
all about having fun."</TE>
<TE>   For others, it's an attempt to reconnect with fraying traditions.
This weekend, Los Angeles will enjoy what sponsors are calling the
city's first San Gennaro festival, a two-day event at Hollywood and
Vine. Across the nation, there are similar celebrations, or festas,
underway.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the pageantry they offer, these festivals seem to have
little or no connection with the daily lives of many Italian
Americans, according to academic experts. Years after most of those
of Italian descent moved out, Mulberry Street and its environs are
best known for candlelight religious processions, cannoli-eating
contests and Frank Sinatra wannabes crooning in cafes.</TE>
<TE>   The legacy of organized crime also is a lure, but even that is
changing. Although thousands of tourists still flock to Umberto's
Clam House, the site of a bloody gangland killing in 1972, the
original is long gone and the current restaurant stands next to a
Chinese laundry. John Gotti's Ravenite Social Club, the Gambino
family's famed hangout, has become a hair salon.</TE>
<TE>   "What you see in New York and other Italian American neighborhoods
is the transformation of a once real place into a museum, a monument
to an ethnic group," said Jerome Krase, a sociology professor at
Brooklyn College who has studied the fate of Little Italys across the
country. "And these places offer a stereotypical view of what
Italians are like. It's like playacting on a grand scale, a
reenactment of something that has vanished."</TE>
<TE>   New York's Little Italy once was a hugely overcrowded tenement
slum. Originally settled by German and Irish immigrants, the area was
inundated with new arrivals from Southern Italy after U.S.
immigration quotas were lifted in 1883. The often squalid
neighborhood, where three and four families crammed into small
apartments, was singled out for criticism by Jacob Riis in his
trailblazing 1890 expose, "How the Other Half Lives."</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, however, Italian Americans found steady work building
the city's subways and bridges; others became police and
firefighters. They prospered and re-created an old-world atmosphere
on Mulberry, Mott, Grand and Elizabeth streets, filling them with
restaurants, theaters, churches and clothing shops.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Little Italy boasted the largest Italian population
of any urban center outside of Italy, once hitting an estimated
250,000. Yet the numbers began diminishing when Italian Americans--as
did the German and Irish before them--grew weary of the
neighborhood's narrow streets and notoriously cramped living
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the area's population has shrunk to about 5,000
people of Italian ancestry, while other ethnic groups have grown
considerably, Krase said. Overall, however, this country's Italian
American population has grown to 15.9 million, according to the 2000
census.</TE>
<TE>   "You're raising a family, you got kids, so what are you gonna do?"
said Russo, recalling her family's eventual move to the suburbs. "You
love a place like Mulberry Street, but you need room. And so one day
you leave."</TE>
<TE>   As Italians left Little Italy, the population of nearby Chinatown
began exploding. What began as a trickle of new stores became a
torrent in 1968, when U.S. immigration restrictions were eased for
Chinese immigrants. Suddenly, Italian shopkeepers were sharing
sidewalks with Asian restaurants and vegetable stands. More
important, Chinese businessmen began acquiring many of the older
tenement buildings once owned by Italians.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the whole place changed before your eyes," said Johnny
Cappello, a San Gennaro food vendor who was born on Mott Street but
moved to a larger home in Brooklyn. "I feel so connected to this
area. I can show you where my grandparents lived. But it's such a
different world now."</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, tourists from all over the nation packed Mulberry
Street, making it difficult to move. Later in the evening, a
religious procession bearing the statue of San Gennaro slowly made
its way past Cappello's candy booth. To the clashing boom of a brass
band and the cheers of thousands, visitors taped $1 bills to the
statue as charity offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsors hope to raise several hundred thousand dollars this year,
but until recently the festival was dogged by suspicions that it had
become a cash cow for organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, emboldened by federal
indictments of several organizers, successfully demanded in 1995 that
an independent auditor examine the San Gennaro fund-raising
operation.</TE>
<TE>   The eye-popping report found that the festival was a mob-run
enterprise that had raised $360,000 the previous year but had given
$11,000 to charity. Since then, a new board of directors has been
appointed.</TE>
<TE>   "The feds drove the mob out," said Jerry Capeci, a longtime
organized crime expert and author of "The Complete Idiot's Guide to
the Mafia."</TE>
<TE>   "You can never completely obliterate the mob influence, because
some gangsters still have hidden interests here. But it's a huge
change."</TE>
<TE>   On Mulberry Street, however, the biggest change of all may have
nothing to do with crime-busting mayors or the steady expansion of
Chinatown. As the procession bearing San Gennaro reached the end of
the street, it passed upscale shoe boutiques, fitness clubs and chic
restaurants. A Ralph Lauren store stood opposite a 19th century
church. Up above, young professionals are moving into small
one-bedroom apartments that rent for $3,000 a month or more.</TE>
<TE>   "Soon, the whole place will be filled with outsiders, you watch,"
Cappello said. "And, really, what do they know about Italian American
life?"</TE>
<TE>   It depends on your definition. Gina Malanga, a Rhode Island
native, had a moment of ecstasy as night fell on Mulberry Street.</TE>
<TE>   She couldn't believe the sizzling aromas of sausage and onions,
broccoli rabe, meatball hero sandwiches, steak and mozzarella, baked
clams, lobster ravioli, calzone, veal parmigiana, grilled eggplant,
tripe marinara, rice balls and stuffed artichokes.</TE>
<TE>   "So many choices!" she said. "It's like Disneyland."</TE>

<HD>Collective Shrug Greets Kentucky Mea Culpa</HD>
<DH>Politics: Gov. Paul E. Patton may have a shot in a Senate
race despite infidelity, experts say. Some voters are inured after
the Clinton era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, Ky.</DL>
<LD>There she stood, newspaperless and a tad sheepish about it, behind
the News &amp; Gifts counter at Blue Grass Airport.</LD>
<LD>   "I tell them every time: 'When there's news, you've got to bring
me more papers," ' said the bespectacled, gray-haired clerk. "They
were gone in no time. Pffft, right out the door. All 50 gone by 9
a.m."</LD>
<LD>   Little wonder. On the front page of the Lexington Herald-Leader
and the Louisville Courier-Journal were enormous close-up photographs
of Gov. Paul E. Patton, crying so hard his nose was running.</LD>
<TE>   The news, of course, was that the second-term Democrat--a father
of four, married to wife Judi for 25 years and head of the National
Governors Assn.--had admitted having an affair with a Kentucky
businesswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The pictures accurately portrayed the most emotional confession by
a politician almost anyone could recall, from the mea culpa by former
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart that scuttled his chances of becoming
president in 1988, to that of former President Clinton, whose fling
with intern Monica S. Lewinsky nearly cost him the Oval Office.</TE>
<TE>   The rub is, in the post-Clinton era, most people here just are not
that worked up about a sex scandal in the governor's mansion. Sure,
they're interested. Of course they are buying the papers and watching
the news.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you see him on TV last night?" one man asked another downtown
on Saturday. "Pathetic."</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, the governor," a waitress at the Glass Garden restaurant said
to a customer reading the newspaper. "The governor," she said again,
as if that was all there was to say.</TE>
<TE>   But on a sunny post-Labor Day Saturday, with the United States
contemplating war with Iraq and the University of Kentucky Wildcats
hosting the Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders at Commonwealth
Stadium, people here were giving the 65-year-old Patton a respite
after a long, hard week. For the time being, they also were giving
him the benefit of the doubt.</TE>
<TE>   If it turns out the governor granted nursing-home owner Tina
Conner business favors, and then sicced state regulators on her when
she ended their affair, as the 40-year-old Conner contends in a
lawsuit, that's a serious issue, people here agree.</TE>
<TE>   If it's just about sex....</TE>
<TE>   "Who cares!" blurted Christina Condra, the feisty 26-year-old
manager of Fayette Cigar Store in downtown Lexington.</TE>
<TE>   "Not me," sighed a passing co-worker.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody does it," said Condra, who is due to have her first
child, a boy, in three weeks. "The only reason anybody cares is
because he's the mayor, or the governor, or whatever it is. They make
a big front-page deal of it because he's a politician. So what? He's
human.</TE>
<TE>   "But you know," she added, "if you play, you gotta pay."</TE>
<TE>   Two days after Conner filed a sexual harassment lawsuit, Patton on
Friday held the emotional news conference, conceding he had engaged
in an "improper personal relationship" with Conner, who was divorced
this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Patton was surrounded by several family members when he spoke, but
his wife--who two days prior had stood beside her husband as he
denied any affair with Conner--was conspicuously absent.</TE>
<TE>   She had gone to stay with sisters in Appalachia, where both she
and her husband were born.</TE>
<TE>   Conner alleges that, after she began seeing Patton romantically in
1997, he helped smooth the way with state regulators for her Western
Kentucky nursing home, Birchtree Healthcare. She also contends Patton
helped ST Construction, a company she owns with her former husband,
secure status as a female-owned business, which makes it easier to
garner state contracts.</TE>
<TE>   After she broke off the relationship, Conner contends that
regulators began hounding the nursing home to the point that Medicare
and Medicaid halted payments to the facility in July and she was
forced to file for bankruptcy protection earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Conner's attorney, Fred Radolovich of Louisville, said he was
planning to meet Monday with lawyers representing the governor to
discuss a possible settlement. The state Executive Branch Ethics
Committee, meanwhile, announced it will launch an investigation into
the case.</TE>
<TE>   What case? organic farmer Pete Cashel asked by raising one eyebrow
Saturday at the Lexington Farmers Market. When told of the governor's
confession to an affair, Cashel, wearing a T-shirt, shorts and dirty
work boots, nodded and said: "Well, good! We need a little of that in
government."</TE>
<TE>   Cashel then became more serious, saying that he thought Patton had
done a better-than-average job during his six-plus years in office,
especially when it came to shaping Kentucky's novel system of using
tobacco settlement money to help onetime tobacco farmers begin
harvesting new crops.</TE>
<TE>   Patton's politics and policies, Cashel said, are what's important.
As for an affair, "that's between him and his wife. He's going to be
in enough trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Patton, who will end his second and, under Kentucky law, final
term in the statehouse next year, was widely believed to be planning
a 2004 run against Republican Sen. Jim Bunning, who is considered
vulnerable. Following his public lie and then an admission of
infidelity, political analysts were still uncertain Saturday how much
the scandal would affect Patton's political future.</TE>
<TE>   If the evidence suggests influence peddling, most agreed, Patton
would be finished politically. If he is nothing more than a
philanderer who then fibbed about an affair, he still might have the
clout to make a Senate run, some suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "I've come to the conclusion that sexual scandals have to be
awfully bad to seriously damage a political figure these days," said
Hastings Wyman, editor of the Southern Political Report.</TE>
<TE>   Wyman recalled how former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards liked to
quip that the only way he would lose an election was to be found in
bed with "a dead woman or a live boy."</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays, I think Edwards could probably get away with the
latter," Wyman said wryly. "When Clinton survived what he survived, I
think we entered a new era, even in the South."</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Fayette Cigar Store--a place redolent of the
high-quality tobaccos that once made Kentucky growers rich and now
makes them eligible for state aid--Condra rubbed her belly and
bellowed again.</TE>
<TE>   "Who cares! Really. There are hookers right there across the way
who do the same thing Monica Lewinsky did, and they're not famous.
They're still there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only because you're the governor or the president or
whatever."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The annual visa lottery--perhaps the strangest ritual in all of U.S.
immigration policy--will begin next month, sparking millions of
entries from foreigners who will buck long odds for a chance to start
life anew in America.</LD>
<LD>   Its very existence is a reminder that, even after the Sept. 11
attacks, the United States keeps its door open to newcomers more than
do most other nations, and that the dream of life here continues to
stir people from all over the world.</LD>
<LD>   But since the terrorist attacks, the unusual sweepstakes has been
beset by heightened security fears. In just the last few months,
three lottery winners from the Middle East have gained notoriety for
crimes and allegations that go to the heart of America's anxieties in
the war against terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Ahmed Hannan and Karim Koubriti, indicted Aug. 28 as members of an
alleged terrorist "sleeper" cell in Michigan planning attacks here
and abroad, came to this country in 2000 after winning the lottery in
Morocco, according to State Department officials and court records.</TE>
<TE>   And in July, an Egyptian who became a legal U.S. resident after
his wife won the visa lottery went on a shooting rampage at Los
Angeles International Airport, killing two people.</TE>
<TE>   The next visa lottery, scheduled to open for entries on Oct. 7,
"is simply not in the interest of our national security," said Rep.
George W. Gekas (R-Pa.), chairman of the House subcommittee on
immigration, pointing to the Michigan indictments to make his case.</TE>
<TE>   By all reckonings, it is an event of interest around the world, a
sweepstakes that has stirred riots in Sierra Leone and stampedes in
Cuba. But in the United States, despite Sept. 11, the lottery remains
a routine event, reflecting the official view that legal immigration
can be a positive force and that America benefits from the energy and
enterprise of its newest residents.</TE>
<TE>   Congress enacted the first version of the lottery in the 1980s
when Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and other legislators sought to
broaden the stream of immigrants, which was dominated by Latin
Americans and Asians who were allowed entry either as political
refugees or because they were sponsored by close relatives or
employers already in the United States. Undocumented Irish immigrants
in Kennedy's home state were an early concern, and the first contests
set aside winning slots for the Irish.</TE>
<TE>   The current version of the lottery provides up to 50,000 permanent
residence visas each year to individuals lacking the family or job
sponsors that most legal immigrants rely on. Winners are chosen in a
computerized drawing. Preferences for the Irish have long since
expired.</TE>
<TE>   From 1998 to 2000, 46% of the winners came from Europe, 22% from
the Middle East and 22% from sub-Sahara Africa, according to
estimates by the Center for Immigration Studies, which seeks to limit
immigration.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, participants mailed 13 million applications to the State
Department. Last year, following the Sept. 11 attacks, the number
slipped to 9.5 million. Entries this year must be received between
Oct. 7 and Nov. 6, and winners will be notified in 2003.

<TE>   Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Los Angeles), who championed the visa
lottery in a simpler era of immigration policy, reflects the shifting
attitudes toward the lottery. In July, one of Berman's constituents
was shot to death by Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, a limousine driver from
Egypt, at the El Al Israel airlines ticket counter at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Berman said he continues to support immigration for such goals as
reuniting families, providing political asylum and supplying
qualified workers to American employers. But, alluding to the LAX
shootings, he said he worries that a lottery may pose "a certain
randomness and lack of institutional safeguards ... that maybe
creates a higher risk of this kind of thing happening."</TE>
<TE>   "The visa lottery program, I have greater questions about that
now, whether it's a sensible policy," Berman said.</TE>
<TE>   Security Flaws Are Cited</TE>
<TE>   Supporters maintain that the program continues to fill a useful
role for deserving immigrants and assert that the concerns voiced by
Berman underscore the need for providing more efficient security, not
for eliminating the lottery.</TE>
<TE>   "Individuals who are otherwise eligible under our laws should be
allowed to immigrate to the United States," Kennedy said in a
statement. Security risks, he added, are not the fault of the lottery
itself but rather "result from inadequate screening and the lack of
intelligence information shared among government agencies."</TE>
<TE>   Others applaud the lottery's basic goal. "It adds to the richness
of the American experience by bringing different peoples into the
country," said Kevin Appleby, director of migration and refugee
policy for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. "With the proper
security measures, we don't see why it should not continue."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone agrees. "It doesn't unite families," asserted Steven
A. Camarota, the Center for Immigration Studies' research director.
"It doesn't serve special business needs. What is the point of it?"</TE>
<TE>   He noted that some individuals who use the lottery come from
nations on the State Department's list of countries that sponsor
terrorism. Last year's winners included 1,297 from Sudan, 768 from
Iran, 529 from Cuba, 71 from Iraq, 62 from Syria, 61 from Libya and
four from North Korea .</TE>
<TE>   Other observers, who may be far more sympathetic to immigration,
nonetheless argue that the value of diversity should not outweigh the
wishes of today's immigrants to be united more quickly with family
members from the old country.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's one of the stupidest ideas ever created in
immigration law ... ," said Carl Shusterman, an immigration lawyer in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "To me it's just like someone cutting in line."</TE>
<TE>   Still others question whether the very strategy of reaching out to
nations that supply few immigrants is fair to countries such as
Mexico, which are purposely excluded from the program.</TE>
<TE>   "Why diversify the immigration pool?" asked Jose Pertierra, a
Washington immigration lawyer. "What's the matter with the ones that
we've got?"</TE>
<TE>   Gekas recently demanded that the State Department stop shredding
the losing lottery entries, which include limited personal
information such as name, date and place of birth and a photograph.</TE>
<TE>   Reviewing such entries might tip off government officials that
terrorists already on government watch lists "may be attempting to
enter the United States through the diversity visa program," Gekas
wrote Secretary of State Colin L. Powell in August.</TE>
<TE>   Shredding to Stop</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, State Department officials replied that they
would stop shredding the applications, "so that unsuccessful entries
will be shared with law enforcement and intelligence agencies if they
decide they are useful."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the State Department, which is in charge of
visas, maintains that the lottery poses no special national security
risks.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, background checking for all would-be immigrants has
become more efficient as a result of reforms imposed since the
terrorist attacks last year, an official said.</TE>
<TE>   Lottery winners "are subject to exactly the same security checks
as any other visa applicant," said Kelly Shannon, a State Department
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The view is widely shared by defenders of the unusual contest.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever questions the lottery may raise, America's immigration
system still needs some way of letting in people who may lack family
or job connections but wish to become productive members of U.S.
society, said Jeanne Butterfield, executive director of the American
Immigration Lawyers Assn. She added: "I'm not prepared to say
eliminate the lottery."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Brooklyn Officer Gets 5 Years in Louima Torture</HD>
<DH>Courts: In a plea deal, Charles Schwarz received the
maximum for lying about his role in the bathroom assault more than
five years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A former police officer was sentenced to five years in prison
Saturday in a last-minute deal that avoided a fourth trial on charges
he lied about the torture of a Haitian immigrant in a precinct
bathroom.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Reena Raggi sentenced Charles Schwarz to five
years in prison--the maximum penalty for perjury. In exchange,
prosecutors dropped outstanding civil rights charges and a second
perjury count.</LD>
<LD>   At sentencing, Raggi scolded Schwarz for lying about "a senseless
and brutal attack."</LD>
<TE>   "No free society can tolerate such conduct from a police officer,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz, who is to surrender Dec. 4, said nothing in response.
Outside court, he told reporters: "I want to thank my supporters and
my attorneys." He declined to answer questions.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz, 36, was scheduled to stand trial for a fourth time
beginning Monday for his part in the attack on Abner Louima inside
the bathroom of a Brooklyn police precinct. The deal came the day
attorneys met to seat a jury, and more than five years after Louima
was assaulted.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad it's finally over," Louima told reporters outside court.
"Now I can move on with my life ... now it's time to start the
healing process."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had alleged that Schwarz held Louima down while fellow
police Officer Justin Volpe sodomized the man with a broken
broomstick; Louima was hospitalized for two months with severe
internal injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz denied ever being inside the bathroom at the 70th
Precinct. Volpe pleaded guilty and is serving a 30-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz's lead attorney, Ronald Fischetti, noted that the
agreement contained no admission of wrongdoing beyond the perjury.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms, Schwarz could earn a 13-month reduction in his
sentence if he, his wife and his attorneys comply with an agreement
not to comment on the case until Schwarz leaves prison, his attorneys
said. Along with credit for good time, Schwarz's attorneys estimated
that he could serve fewer than three years.</TE>
<TE>   The attack by the white officers prompted citywide protests. The
city and the Patrolmen's Benevolent Assn. agreed to pay Louima an
$8.75-million settlement in his civil suit last year, the most ever
paid to a New York City police brutality victim.</TE>
<TE>   In the first two trials, Schwarz was convicted of violating
Louima's rights and of conspiring to cover up the crime. The
convictions were overturned by a federal appeals court that ordered
the third trial.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Schwarz was convicted of perjury for claiming on the
witness stand that he was not the second officer in the bathroom,
although the jury deadlocked on the more serious charge that he
violated Louima's civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz, who has already spent nearly three years in prison, was
released on $1-million bail in March after a federal appeals court
overturned his conviction of violating Louima's civil rights.</TE>

<HD>New Miss America Is Crowned</HD>
<DH>Pageant: She is Erika Harold, 22, from Illinois. She sang
an aria from 'Carmen' and performed commendably in a quiz about pop
culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Erika Harold, who put Harvard University law school on hold so she
could compete in the Miss America Pageant as Miss Illinois, won it
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Harold, 22, an opera singer from Urbana, Ill., wowed judges with
"Habanera," an aria from the opera "Carmen," and performed ably on a
newly added contemporary culture pop quiz given to the five
finalists.</LD>
<LD>   She gasped, covered her mouth and bent her knees in disbelief when
her name was announced, then ducked her head to receive the crown
from outgoing Miss America Katie Harman.</LD>
<TE>   Miss Alabama Scarlotte Deupree was first runner-up; Miss Oklahoma
Casey Preslar was second runner-up; Miss Nevada Teresa Benitez was
third runner-up; and Miss Maryland Camille Lewis rounded out the
finalists.</TE>
<TE>   Harold, a University of Illinois graduate who wants to practice
public policy law and run for national office someday, was supposed
to start at Harvard this fall. She delayed her enrollment after
winning her state pageant and a shot at Miss America.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, the year with the crown will help her pay
tuition: She earned a $50,000 scholarship for winning Saturday night,
and thousands more in her state crown and Miss America preliminaries.</TE>
<TE>   She plans to fight youth violence during her national speaking
tour as Miss America. She said she was bullied as a child and hopes
that she can help bullying victims break their silence by showing
them it even happened to a Miss America.</TE>
<TE>   "I want kids to be able to break that culture of silence that
makes kids feel so ashamed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But she has other goals, too.</TE>
<TE>   "As Miss America I hope to really define what Miss America is
rather than spending my time defending the organization," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The pageant has had a rocky year topped by a controversy over
topless photos that threatened to place two North Carolinas in the
pageant. The former Miss America CEO also threatened to move the
pageant from Atlantic City unless state and city leaders promised new
subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Harold said she is a minority Miss America who fills out 'other'
on Census forms. Her mother is part black, part American Indian and
part Russian and her father's ethnic background is Greek, German,
Welsh and English.</TE>
<TE>   Harold correctly answered 10 of the 16 multiple choice questions
on the pop quiz--second best to Deupree among the finalists.</TE>
<TE>   The quiz, which was aimed at showing the contestants' brainpower,
added a pinch of "Jeopardy" to the staid old beauty pageant, with
host Wayne Brady quizzing the five women on contemporary culture and
American history.</TE>
<TE>   Harold's crowning may boost the Miss America Organization's
never-ending crusade to be taken seriously as something other than a
bathing beauty festival. The organization is the largest provider of
scholarships to women in the world, but its swimsuit competition and
emphasis on beauty have hampered those efforts.</TE>
<TE>   It also ended what had been a controversial year for the pageant.</TE>
<TE>   Rebekah Revels, 24, who won the Miss North Carolina state pageant,
later resigned after an ex-boyfriend told Miss America officials he
had topless photos of her.</TE>
<TE>   First runner-up Misty Clymer got the job, but then Revels sued to
be reinstated, contending that pageant executives forced her to quit
in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   When the women arrived in Atlantic City on Sept. 8 for pageant
preparations, there were 52--one for each state and the District of
Columbia and two for North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   A judge sided with the pageant, the photos never surfaced and
Clymer got to keep her crown.</TE>
<TE>   In other pageant troubles, its former CEO threatened to move if
city or state leaders didn't ante up with new subsidies.</TE>

<HD>Police Snapshots of Suspects Stir Rights Debate in Delaware</HD>
<DH>Law: Officials defend the policy as a legal part of
fighting drug dealing and street crime. Critics say it violates the
privacy of innocent people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WILMINGTON, Del.</DL>
<LD>The city police department's Corner Deployment Unit is known as the
"jump-out squad" for bursting out of vehicles to question and search
suspects. Its officers also are known for something else: snapping
photos of suspects they stop, even those they don't arrest.</LD>
<LD>   City officials defend the practice as a legal and effective part
of fighting drug dealing and street crime.</LD>
<LD>   Critics say it violates the constitutional rights of innocent
people.</LD>
<TE>   In an era when surveillance cameras peer from buildings and
parking lots, courts have ruled that people can't expect privacy in
public places. Civil libertarians argue that police photographing
people they don't arrest is a different matter.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no authority to forcibly photograph someone and enter
them into a database when they have committed no crime," said Barry
Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not aware of any other municipal police department that has
engaged in this type of behavior," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmington Mayor James Baker describes such criticism as
"blithering idiocy," saying police take pains to protect the rights
of law-abiding citizens while targeting people "who are killing our
neighborhoods, who are killing our people."</TE>
<TE>   City officials deny police are photographing individuals they
believe are likely to commit crimes. Some media reports have compared
the technique to "Minority Report," a recent science fiction movie in
which police identify criminals before they commit crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a Gestapo technique; it's not anything other than a
progressive means of policing an urban environment," said police
spokesman Cpl. Stephen Martelli.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the photos can serve as proof that a person
arrested for loitering received other warnings. They also are kept as
"possible evidence for ongoing investigations," authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Michael Szczerba said his department has taken
photographs of suspects for years without complaints.</TE>
<TE>   It's "highly improbable" that innocent people were caught up in
the stops, he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to city officials, 658 people were stopped and
questioned from June, when the jump-out squad's "Operation Bold
Eagle" began, to last week. Among them, 546 were arrested, and 708
charges were filed.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe the other 112 are involved in criminal activity,
even if officers didn't find enough evidence that day to arrest them.</TE>
<TE>   Drewry Fennell, executive director of the ACLU's Delaware chapter,
says that shouldn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Their criminal histories are not relevant to their rights to move
freely about on the street," Fennell said.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU is considering a lawsuit but, so far, no one has come
forward with a formal complaint, he said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials have met with representatives of the ACLU, NAACP
and Urban League to hear their concerns, and another meeting is
scheduled Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In crime-troubled neighborhoods, some residents have welcomed the
camera-toting police.</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather have innocent people's pictures taken than
innocent people shot," said Barbara Washam, who joined a rally last
week to support the police.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Baker said the photo policy doesn't violate the Constitution
or the U.S. Supreme Court's 1968 decision in Terry vs. Ohio that says
police may stop and frisk people if they have reasonable suspicion
they are engaged in criminal activity.</TE>
<TE>   The state attorney general and chief federal prosecutor for
Delaware agreed that Wilmington police appear to be acting within the
law.</TE>
<TE>   But others disagree, saying the Terry decision allows police only
to briefly detain and question suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't use Terry as a pretext to go out and gather a
photographic database of suspects," said professor Phyllis Bookspan,
who teaches constitutional criminal procedure at Widener University.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say officers exercise discretion.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Friday night on a street corner, the squad frisked and
questioned six men while investigating suspected drug dealing.</TE>
<TE>   Patrol Officer George Collins questioned one of the men, then
pulled a digital camera from his pocket and asked if he could take
his picture.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I ask why you're doing this to me?" replied the man, who
showed identification and told police he was just walking to the
store.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not a criminal, you don't have anything to worry
about," Collins answered. "It's for future reference."</TE>
<TE>   Satisfied with the identification, Collins pocketed his camera
without snapping a photo.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a resident, so I gave him the option," Collins explained.</TE>

<HD>At Least 70,000 Terrorist Suspects on Watch List</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: U.S. believes an unknown number of operatives are
already inside the country.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. officials have identified at least 70,000 suspected terrorists
around the world and say an unknown number of Al Qaeda-trained
soldiers have been trying for at least five years to infiltrate the
United States and launch "spectacular" attacks, according to two
congressional reports issued last week and all but ignored in the
flurry of headlines that accompanied hearings into intelligence
failures before the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The reports, based on recently declassified intelligence and law
enforcement information, indicate that the State Department's watch
list of dangerous individuals contains the names of 70,000 "members
of foreign terrorist organizations, known hijackers, car bombers,
assassins or hostage-takers."</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials stressed that the threshold for making the watch
list is low. But, in the reports, they also said they fear that an
unidentified number of suspected terrorists--on and off the list--may
already be inside the United States because of serious, long-standing
gaps in information-sharing by the CIA and the State Department.</LD>
<TE>   The reports, which include other troubling insights into the war
on global terrorism, were released during three days of congressional
hearings into the missed warning signs of the attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon. They provide a window into the ongoing
threat that authorities say Al Qaeda and other terrorist
organizations continue to pose to the United States and its interests
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   But the disclosures were overshadowed by the often-riveting
testimony that focused on the myriad mistakes, miscommunications and
bureaucratic entanglements between the FBI and CIA that occurred as
the Sept. 11 hijackers planned and launched their attacks without
disruption by U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, a U.S. intelligence official said the reports
only made public what the CIA and FBI have known for years.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives you some idea of the enormity of the challenge we face,"
said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "It's a
lot more complicated than is generally acknowledged, for a variety of
reasons."</TE>
<TE>   "Al Qaeda continues to be a threat," said the official. "But they
are not the only threat out there."</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence official said Al Qaeda remains as dangerous an
organization today as it was before Sept. 11. The official also said
the terrorist threat spreads far beyond Al Qaeda to other militant
Islamic groups, as well as such terrorist organizations as 17
November in Greece, Abu Sayyaf in Southeast Asia and FARC in
Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   A State Department official confirmed the numbers in the reports
on Saturday but added that there are now about 80,000 suspected
terrorists on the list, which has been growing by 2,000 names a month
since last September. "It's a lot of names," said the official, "but
it's based on 15 years of information."</TE>
<TE>   The two reports were issued by Eleanor Hill, staff director of the
joint congressional inquiry, which spent months interviewing key law
enforcement and intelligence officials and reviewing classified
documents. They disclosed repeated attempts by Al Qaeda to recruit
U.S. citizens in its jihad, or holy war, against the United States
since at least 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The report said the terror network, led by Osama bin Laden, has
created front companies on U.S. soil for terrorist activities and has
acted aggressively to establish "operative" cells within U.S. borders
to launch bombings, hijackings and assassinations of government
leaders, as well as attacks on landmarks, government buildings and
tourist attractions.</TE>
<TE>   The report cited one "closely held intelligence report for senior
government officials" issued in August 2001 that concluded that
"members of Al Qaeda, including some U.S. citizens, had resided or
traveled in or traveled to the United States for years, and that the
group apparently maintained a support structure here." Both reports
focused mainly on the breakdowns in cooperation between intelligence
and law enforcement agencies, but they also cited the dangerous
professionalism of Al Qaeda members, including a much-publicized plot
to hijack a plane and crash it into CIA headquarters in Langley, Va.,
in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The conspirators, according to a 1995 intelligence study included
in the report, carefully studied security procedures in the
Washington area before choosing their target and means of attack. "If
terrorists operating in this country, the United States, are
similarly methodical, they will identify serious vulnerabilities" in
the nation's air travel and security systems, it said.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, a 2000 classified report by the FBI and Federal
Aviation Administration concluded that international terrorist
groups--Al Qaeda and others--were operating within the United States
and engaged in fund-raising, recruiting new members, disseminating
propaganda and planning attacks.</TE>
<TE>   And a June 2001 warning found by the congressional investigators
said U.S. intelligence officials believed Islamic extremists
associated with Al Qaeda "are most likely to attempt spectacular
attacks, resulting in numerous casualties."</TE>
<TE>   The report also mentioned other terrorist plots involving U.S.
citizens, including a plan by an American Al Qaeda member to fly a
hang glider into the Egyptian presidential palace and then detonate
explosives. It said the individual received hang glider training in
the United States and then brought the hang glider back to
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2000, the intelligence community obtained information
regarding an alleged Bin Laden plot to hijack a commercial jetliner.</TE>
<TE>   "The source, who was a walk-in to the FBI's Newark office, claimed
that he had been to a training camp in Pakistan, where he learned
hijacking techniques and received arms training," Hill wrote. "He
also stated that he was supposed to meet five to six other
individuals in the United States who would also participate in the
plot. Although the individual passed an FBI polygraph, the FBI was
never able to verify any aspect of his story or identify his contacts
in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Much of last week's congressional testimony focused on how the CIA
failed to share with the FBI vital information about two of the
hijackers before the Sept. 11 attacks that could have prevented them
from entering the United States. That lack of information sharing has
been widely reported.</TE>
<TE>   But the hearings also disclosed another far less-publicized
counterterrorism problem. According to congressional investigators,
the CIA repeatedly failed to share important information with the
State Department that could have been entered into its Tipoff watch
list and used to keep terrorists out of the country.</TE>
<TE>   When given the proper information, Tipoff has had significant
success in thwarting terrorists from entering the United States by
flagging their applications at U.S. consular offices overseas and at
INS and Customs points of entry at U.S. borders, according to
testimony by Christopher A. Kojm, a top official in the State
Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research.</TE>
<TE>   From its inception in 1987 to September 2002, Tipoff has enabled
the State Department to deny entry to nearly 800 suspected hijackers,
hostage holders, assassins, bombers and other terrorists, or allowed
U.S. law enforcement to nab them while entering the United States,
Kojm said.</TE>
<TE>   During the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Tipoff was linked to INS and
Customs computers, allowing U.S. authorities to deny entry to, or
arrest, about 290 suspected terrorists from 82 countries at 84 U.S.
ports of entry, Kojm testified.</TE>
<TE>   But while the State Department and other immigration agencies rely
on that database to screen those traveling to the United States,
investigators found that the CIA did not pass along names of
suspected terrorists--even after Congress expressed concerns about
the situation in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Most notable was the CIA's failure to alert the State Department
about two suspects who turned out to be hijackers. CIA officials knew
that Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi attended an important Al
Qaeda meeting in Malaysia in 2000. About a year later, the CIA linked
the two to suspected orchestrators of the bombing of the U.S. warship
Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the CIA didn't alert the State Department to add al-Mihdhar
and Alhazmi to the watch list until Aug. 23, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   By then, it was too late--they were already in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The report contrasted that failure with the case of another
suspected terrorist who was added promptly to the watch list and was
stopped before he could enter the United States. The different
outcomes, one report said, "dramatically illustrate that the prompt,
routine and accurate flow of names of suspected terrorists [to the
watch list] is an important part of the U.S. government's efforts to
keep terrorists out of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the two hijackers, the report said, "the system
broke down" because they were not added to the watch list, depriving
the FBI, State Department, INS and other domestic agencies of the
opportunity to either question them or follow them once they got in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Added Kojm: "Tipoff was originally designed to help prevent
precisely what occurred on Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Another apparent intelligence failure was disclosed by the staff
reports: an associate of the two hijackers, Tawfiq Attash Khallad,
wasn't added to the State Department watch list until Aug. 23, 2001,
even though he was known to be a top Al Qaeda operative.</TE>
<TE>   Khallad had been identified at least several months earlier as
being the suspected organizer of the Cole bombing, which killed 17
U.S. sailors. In July 2001, a CIA officer described him as being "a
major league killer, who orchestrated the Cole attack and possibly
the Africa bombings," which killed 224 people at U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Khallad remains at large.</TE>
<TE>   Those weren't the only problems with the Tipoff system identified
by congressional investigators. The CIA, for instance, failed to
submit at least 1,500 intelligence reports in their files to the
State Department until a month after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   And after Sept. 11, the number of suspected terrorist names
forwarded to the State Department by the CIA jumped nearly five-fold.
From Sept. 12, 2001, until the end of that year, 4,252 suspected
terrorists were added to the State Department list.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA explained that it had no formal system in place for
forwarding the names to the State Department. Also, much of the
information used by the CIA to compile the suspects' names comes in
the form of "information" cables--such as the one that first linked
al-Mihdhar to the Al Qaeda cell--that are rarely read.</TE>
<TE>   "Several [CIA] employees told us that they typically did not have
time to even read information cables," the staff investigators found.
Such failures were especially ''puzzling," they added, because they
occurred when the FBI and CIA were deluged with indications of
imminent Al Qaeda attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those problems have been corrected since Sept. 11, and the
CIA is now sharing far more information, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But State Department officials said staffers entering the Tipoff
data into computers are overwhelmed. And the CIA agents charged with
forwarding the names are swamped too.</TE>
<TE>   "The comment I hear most often from working-level people on both
sides--the CIA and FBI--involved directly in this Bin Laden business
is, with a panic-stricken look in their eyes, saying that 'We're
going to miss stuff; we're missing stuff,' " said a CIA agent who
testified anonymously last week. "We can't keep up."</TE>

<HD>The Entrepreneur Who Saw Road to Profit in Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH>The U.S. says Earnest James Ujaama pitched his idea for a
'jihad training camp' in Oregon to a reputed recruiter of terrorists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BLY, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Prosperity may have bypassed this corner of the Pacific Northwest,
but self-styled entrepreneur Earnest James Ujaama sensed opportunity.
In the secluded landscape of parched ranch land and rugged volcanic
outcroppings, he saw visions of Afghanistan--and a chance for profit
in the jihad training business.</LD>
<LD>   In the fall of 1999, federal authorities say, Ujaama faxed a
proposal promoting creation of a "jihad training camp" in the United
States. It was addressed to a radical London cleric and reputed Al
Qaeda recruiter named Abu Hamza Al-Masri.</LD>
<LD>   Ujaama--a Muslim convert from Seattle, born James Earnest
Thompson--had become a protege of Abu Hamza, according to U.S.
officials who say the American pledged bayat, an oath of loyalty, to
the mullah. Ujaama studied Islam at the London mosque and helped
manage an affiliated Web site advocating violence against the United
States and other Western nations.</LD>
<TE>   Initial response to the proposed Afghanistan-style training
operation in rural Oregon seemed favorable.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say two suspected Al Qaeda associates from Europe were
soon dispatched to inspect the site, a tumbledown parcel containing
several derelict trailers and cordoned off by barbed wire. Upon
arrival, one of the operatives boasted that he was "a hit man" for
Osama bin Laden, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Ujaama, in his early 30s at the time, already had an impressive
record of business start-ups. He had won acclaim from lawmakers in
the Pacific Northwest and Nevada for his entrepreneurship and
community activism. A Washington state legislator had even proclaimed
an official day in his honor.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Ujaama floated his training camp pitch--to charge
recruits for instruction--he was already familiar with Al Qaeda's
network of boot camps in eastern Afghanistan, authorities say. He had
visited the region, holding a letter of introduction to Taliban
authorities provided by Abu Hamza. He even helped one young recruit
from the London mosque gain entry to a terrorist training facility in
Afghanistan, according to law enforcement documents.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, authorities say, Ujaama's audacious proposal
disintegrated into a kind of moujahedeen comic-opera. According to
federal investigators, the Al Qaeda agents who ventured to Oregon
complained of grossly inflated claims and abysmal conditions at the
ranch. Apparently blaming Ujaama, the burly militant calling himself
Bin Laden's hit man mused about killing the Seattle deal-maker.</TE>
<TE>   "Ujaama basically saw this as a cash cow," said one federal
official, referring to the proposed Oregon camp. But, he said, once
the amateurish reality on the ground became clear, "No
self-respecting international terrorist would have anything to do
with" Ujaama's plan.</TE>
<TE>   Today, almost three years later, the 36-year-old Ujaama sits in
federal custody in Seattle, accused of providing material support to
international terrorists. At the heart of the indictment against him
is the alleged training camp scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, however, authorities acknowledge that the case against
Ujaama is aimed at bagging a more substantial quarry: the London
cleric, Abu Hamza.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Hamza is a striking figure--one-eyed, steel claws for hands, a
victim, he says, of a mine explosion in Afghanistan. The sheik is an
open admirer of Bin Laden and has inspired a global network of
followers, making him one of the best-known advocates of militant
Islam in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month Abu Hamza and his mosque hosted a de facto
celebration of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon, which was labeled "A Towering Day in History."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and French authorities have privately expressed frustration
that London has not moved more aggressively against a number of
British-based Muslim militants, notably Abu Hamza, a naturalized
citizen of the United Kingdom. Despite his incendiary talk--the
cleric has urged youngsters to go to Afghanistan, has publicly
justified last year's and other attacks, and has warned of more--Abu
Hamza denies inciting or participating in violence. So far, British
freedom of speech statutes have shielded him from prosecution. The
sheik addressed Oxford students last year.</TE>
<TE>   Sources have confirmed that Abu Hamza and the two alleged Al Qaeda
emissaries dispatched to Oregon are the three unnamed co-conspirators
cited in the indictment filed against Ujaama in federal court in
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Ujaama is not charged with anything related to last year's
terrorist attacks. However, he is one of only a handful of U.S.
natives accused of aiding Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment and other law enforcement accounts,
Ujaama conspired with confederates "to murder and maim," while
discussing crimes that included robberies, poisoning water supplies
and firebombing vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The complex picture emerging of Ujaama is that of a hustler who
dabbled on the fringes of global terrorism with an eye to make a
buck--an image more suggestive of a capitalist go-getter than of a
political or religious fanatic.</TE>
<TE>   the same time, Ujaama has expressed increasingly radical
views--recently echoing Abu Hamza's conspiracy theory that Washington
likely had advance knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks but refused to
intervene, in an apparent effort to have a pretext with which to
crack down on Muslims worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever his true convictions, Ujaama clearly has become an
important pawn in one corner of the war on terrorism: U.S. efforts to
reach into the nerve center of radical Islam in London and take down
a leader regarded as one of Al Qaeda's principal front men.</TE>
<TE>   An Entrepreneurial Spirit From an Early Age</TE>
<TE>   He still was James Earnest Thompson when he started his first
business at age 9, raking leaves in the neighborhood with his
brother. He launched a home maintenance service when he was 14, then
moved in with relatives in California, where he hawked discount store
coupons. At 16 he was back in Seattle, where he was named top
salesman at a downtown clothier before moving on to other
self-employment ventures, at one point directing profits to starving
children in Ethiopia.</TE>
<TE>   "For my brother, being an entrepreneur was the ultimate," says
Mustafa Ujaama, 34, an intense, bearded man and the father of seven.
"But it wasn't about money. My brother ... never had a brand-new car;
he never had a house. It was about bringing jobs to the community,
about helping people. He always told us he got into business so we
wouldn't have to struggle."</TE>
<TE>   He still was James Earnest Thompson when his father brought FBI
attention to the young family by his associations with the Black
Panther Party.</TE>
<TE>   Almost from infancy, James and his two younger brothers were
steeped in social concerns. Lacking money for a baby-sitter, his
mother took them along when she joined a picket line in support of
striking teachers at an elementary school resisting plans to be
moved.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all out there chanting, 'Hell no, our teachers won't go,'
" recalled his mother, Peggi Thompson, who is raising Ujaama's
12-year-old son, Karim. She worked with a Seattle anti-poverty
program and the community college. "From a very young age, my
children were taught, and I was taught: 'Your voice means something.
Never be afraid to stand up for what you believe.' "</TE>
<TE>   Patriotism also was a family value.</TE>
<TE>   "We always put the flag out for Veterans Day and Fourth of July,"
Ujaama's mother said. "Those are big days in our family." She traces
her family's lineage to the Revolutionary War. Her Seattle
condominium is crammed with photographs of loved ones, among them
pictures of two uncles who were decorated for their service with the
Tuskegee Airmen, the acclaimed unit of black fliers in World War II.
One was lost over Italy; his Purple Heart citation occupies a
position of honor. Also here are uniformed photographs of James'
younger brother, Mustafa, a Persian Gulf War veteran. When he was
interviewed recently about his brother, Mustafa was wearing a T-shirt
with the logo of the New York City Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   Prominent on the bookcase is a 1994 photo of Ujaama receiving a
legislative certificate proclaiming "James Ujaama Day" in Washington
state. Ujaama had changed his name several years earlier in
solidarity with Mustafa, who had adopted the new name and converted
to Islam while in the military. (Mustafa says "Ujaama" is roughly
equivalent to the Swahili expression for "cooperative economics," and
the Arabic for "group.")</TE>
<TE>   James Ujaama's early history recalls that red-white-and blue
American archetype: the up-and-comer. That's the impression
Ujaama--born with "the gift of the gab," his mother says--left in his
wake as he hastened to transcend his working-class origins.</TE>
<TE>   "James Ujaama was going places," says Charlie James, a longtime
community activist and family friend. His heroes were self-made black
millionaires like Ezell Stephens, who founded a successful fried
chicken chain in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "He spewed out ideas like a machine gun: books, buttons for black
empowerment, business classes," wrote Robert L. Jamieson Jr., a
columnist for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer who has known Ujaama for
a decade.</TE>
<TE>   An impatient Ujaama hadn't even completed high school before he
enrolled at the University of Washington. He was found out and forced
to study for an equivalency degree--then, in a fit of rage that
displayed his ample temper, Ujaama tore up the document, and dropped
out of college.</TE>
<TE>   "That upset me so much. I think I still have the pieces of paper
somewhere," his mother recounted. "A family member once said: If
James would ever stick to one idea, and give it to someone else to
carry it out, he would be a multimillionaire by now."</TE>
<TE>   Averse to the 9-to-5 routine, and hesitant to work for others,
Ujaama reinvented himself as a peddler of business itself.</TE>
<TE>   He bought and sold a small computer shop and used the proceeds to
co-found a nonprofit organization, Be Your Own Boss Unlimited, an
urban self-help group. Ujaama soon was an inspirational speaker in
demand, an entrepreneurial guru offering an alternative to drugs and
gangs as the crack cocaine epidemic mushroomed. "Young, gifted and
black," was the headline of an admiring profile in the business pages
of the Seattle Times in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Ujaama had put together enough cash to publish a
handbook, "Young People's Guide to Starting a Business Without
Selling Drugs." The book jacket includes a photograph of Ujaama on
the front porch of his mother's rambling home on a tree-lined Seattle
street wearing a jacket emblazoned with the motto, "Success."</TE>
<TE>   Privately, some friends accused Ujaama of being over the top.</TE>
<TE>   "People said he was square," said an older cousin, Aaron Dixon, a
former leader of the Black Panther Party in Seattle. "But James was a
serious, dedicated young man. He knew what he wanted. And he went
after it." Photos from those days show Ujaama baby-faced, slim,
bespectacled, clean-shaven, typically in a suit and tie.</TE>
<TE>   As the 1990s progressed, even as he was perpetually broke, Ujaama
persuaded banks and other institutions to help fund the publishing of
two sequels to his entrepreneur treatise. He was invited to speak at
a youth panel at the 1994 National Assn. for the Advancement of
Colored People convention in Chicago. He taught business skills at
nonprofit training centers in Seattle and Las Vegas, lobbied for
legislation to aid minority and youth business and became close to
regional black politicians, with whom he was often photographed.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Ujaama never wavered from his deep belief that business--not
politics--was the path to prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't get into politics: Politicians are only prostitutes for
business," Ujaama counseled his brother Mustafa when his younger
sibling joined Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Ujaama published an autobiographical novel, "Coming Up,"
tracking the life trajectories of two black entrepreneurs--one
straight, one a drug dealer. He went to Hollywood and tried
unsuccessfully to sell a screenplay version of the urban allegory.
That failure left him disenchanted and, again, short on cash.</TE>
<TE>   Mustafa, who noticed Europe's fascination with African American
culture while stationed in Germany, suggested his brother migrate
across the Atlantic. Mustafa had a friend in London.</TE>
<TE>   By this time, Ujaama was in his 30s and the father of a young son
he couldn't support. About the time he published his novel, Ujaama
followed his brother's lead and embraced Islam. He took his
entrepreneurial zeal--and disappointments--to the streets of Europe's
most populous city. There he found a home and a mosque in the
ethnically diverse hotbed for radical Islam, in what the European
press came to call Londonistan.</TE>
<TE>   More Like a Political Meet Than a Religious One</TE>
<TE>   On the recent anniversary of Sept. 11, the scene at North London
Central Mosque in Finsbury Park resembled a raucous political
convention.</TE>
<TE>   The mosque was once frequented by Richard Reid, the indicted "shoe
bomber," and Zacarias Moussaoui, accused of being the so-called 20th
hijacker. On this anniversary day, a gathering of radical Muslim
speakers concluded that the United States got what it deserved.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, as scores of police in bright yellow vests kept guard,
Muslim youths--many the sons of recent immigrants--mingled with older
worshipers identified by observers as battle-hardened veterans of
Afghanistan, Algeria and Chechnya, among other fronts. All
occasionally broke into chants of "Allah Akhbar!" (God is great!) as
a riposte to noisy anti-immigrant protesters across the way.</TE>
<TE>   The Finsbury Park mosque is a squat, three-story brick building
rising across the street from a subway stop in a bustling
neighborhood that, in its edgy urban energy, is more reminiscent of
immigrant enclaves of New York and Los Angeles than the tourist-guide
London of Big Ben, friendly bobbies and cantankerous cockneys. Of all
the mosques in London--and there are scores, serving a very diverse
and overwhelmingly moderate Muslim population--Ujaama was drawn to
this one, among the most notorious in Europe. It is the base of Abu
Hamza.</TE>
<TE>   The cleric was born Mustafa Kemal in Egypt. He is a brawny onetime
nightclub bouncer and U.K.-trained civil engineer.</TE>
<TE>   After last year's attacks, Washington placed Abu Hamza on a list
of suspected terrorist financiers because of his links to the Islamic
Army of Aden, an Al Qaeda-associated group allegedly responsible for
kidnapping foreigners and the 2000 attack on the U.S. warship Cole in
Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities charge that Ujaama--who grew a scraggly beard and
took the names Bilal Ahmed and Abu Samayya, among other
aliases--served as a kind of aide-de-camp to Abu Hamza. The FBI says
Ujaama helped craft the cleric's affiliated "Supporters of Shariah"
Web site and tried to convince new recruits to pledge bayat to the
sheik.</TE>
<TE>   In London, Ujaama set up a political Web site,
http://www.stopamerica.org, which lashed out at U.S. policy but
stopped short of advocating violence.</TE>
<TE>   "We the people of the United States charge this government and
their coalition with conspiracy to commit genocide and crimes of
terrorism against Muslim people in our names," Ujaama wrote in his
"founder's message" on the Web site, which since has been shut down.</TE>
<TE>   Ujaama married a Somalian immigrant and fathered a daughter, now
2. The couple lived for a time in a flat on a drab street of brick
row houses in an immigrant enclave of East London, near Ujaama's
in-laws and the commuter train tracks. According to Abu Hamza, Ujaama
worked with refugee families from Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Ujaama told relatives he was working
with children and orphans.</TE>
<TE>   He founded a Web design and computer business called visioideas
and forged a relationship with a Karachi, Pakistan-based Internet
development firm, eTaleem.com.</TE>
<TE>   "I found Bilal [Ujaama] to be a good Muslim as well as a
professional businessman," Najam Hammed, eTaleem's chief operating
officer, said in an e-mail from Karachi. "He was much interested in
educating the down trodden [sic] and uplifting the image of the
Muslims and the allegations leveled against him are the opposite of
what we found him to be."</TE>
<TE>   But the computer business was apparently not lucrative. One
American friend who visited his London flat said Ujaama had to borrow
money from "the brothers" at the mosque for carfare.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Ujaama told his Pakistani associates that he went to
Afghanistan to set up a computer training institute there. According
to one federal source, Ujaama carried a handwritten letter of
recommendation from Abu Hamza addressed to the interior minister of
the Taliban government in Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   A confidential FBI memorandum states that Ujaama also is suspected
of "taking computers to the Taliban" on behalf of Abu Hamza before
the U.S. attack after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief impromptu interview in the mosque's red-carpeted
basement, Abu Hamza conceded that Ujaama served as a Web master for a
while but scoffed at suggestions of a father-son type relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do I need to give him a letter?" Abu Hamza asked, as a young
follower, his face hidden behind a colorful Palestinian-style head
scarf, abruptly reached out to switch off a journalist's tape
recorder. "In Afghanistan, they don't read. They just shoot first,"
Abu Hamza said, laughing and generating chuckles from his entourage.</TE>
<TE>   The cleric's London attorney denied that Ujaama and Abu Hamza were
as close as U.S. prosecutors allege. "Abu Hamza is not the type of
person to get close to many people," said Muddassar Arani, the
solicitor. "That's basically because he knows anyone who tries to get
close to him is probably working for the government."</TE>
<TE>   While living in London, Ujaama made regular trips home to Seattle.
Often he brought along some of the tape-recorded speeches of Abu
Hamza that are sold at the Finsbury Park mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Seattle, Ujaama's younger brother Mustafa had helped
establish a storefront mosque in the central city. Ujaama introduced
Abu Hamza's teachings to the Seattle congregation.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought us all the books and knowledge that you couldn't get
here in America," said Ali Shahid Abdul-Raheem, 30, formerly known as
Patrick Fitzsimmons. An ex-cabby from Seattle, Raheem said he
converted to Islam while doing prison time for robbery.</TE>
<TE>   During some of Ujaama's visits, the prayer leader, or imam, of the
Seattle mosque was an outspoken man of Lebanese origin named Semi
Osman. Fluent in Arabic, Osman was skilled at reciting from the
Koran. Osman also was a mechanic, perpetually short of cash and
supporting a wife and her two children from a previous marriage.</TE>
<TE>   For a time it appeared that Osman and fellow worshipers found hope
for a better life almost 400 miles to the southeast, on a 160-acre
patch of parched earth north of the California line.</TE>
<TE>   Bly is a forlorn burg of about 700 souls in ranching country known
for its isolation, red band trout and mule deer. Its most notable
event came in 1945, when a Japanese balloon bomb that had drifted
over the Pacific detonated and killed a woman and five children who
were picnicking. The town's economy has been on life support since
the lumber mill moved out more than a dozen years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-1999, a friend of Osman's wife married a gruff Oregon
rancher who had a place outside of Bly. The woman, also a converted
Muslim, invited Osman, his wife and family to join them, according to
various people knowledgeable about the events.</TE>
<TE>   Osman shared his aspirations with some friends at the mosque. One
version is that he proposed a kind of Islamic commune at the ranch, a
place where all could live, practice their religion, customs and
raise their children according to strict Muslim law. Another mosque
member says Osman suggested the ranch could provide fresh meat
according to Muslim dietary laws, even a possible cemetery site for
religious burials. Yet another says that "Sammy," as he was known,
simply "wanted to be a potato farmer."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reasons, by the fall of 1999 worshipers from Seattle
began making the odyssey to Bly. Abdul-Raheem, the former
Fitzsimmons, drove his Graytop cab all the way down--and was bitterly
disappointed at the dilapidated trailers and hillbilly-like
atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "The place was a mess," said Abdul-Raheem, who sports a drooping
reddish beard and might seem at home in an Irish pub--except for his
woven kufi, or skullcap. "I slept in my cab and went home. I was
sorry I missed the weekend fares in Seattle."</TE>
<TE>   But authorities say Ujaama the entrepreneur saw a possible
business bonanza, one that conveniently aligned with his political
program.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, in October 1999 Ujaama sent a fax to
London proposing the site as a training camp. He compared the
rolling, dry terrain to that of Afghanistan and said the area could
be used to "store and conceal guns, bunkers and ammunition," while
also serving as a handy safe house for a proposed visit by Abu Hamza,
the indictment says.</TE>
<TE>   Ujaama's motives went beyond "just looking for a way to make a
buck," said U.S. Atty. John McKay, the top federal prosecutor in
Seattle. "He changed to support terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 26, authorities allege, Abu Hamza dispatched two
"emissaries" to evaluate the Oregon property as a potential training
camp. According to the indictment, the pair flew to New York, then
made their way to Seattle and Bly, where they met potential training
candidates, established security through the use of guard patrols and
passwords, conducted firearms training "and viewed a video recording
on the subject of improvised poisons."</TE>
<TE>   Sources familiar with the case identified the pair as aides to Abu
Hamza. One was Oussama Kassir, a bulky Swede of Lebanese ancestry
with a long criminal background who supposedly claimed to be Bin
Laden's "hit man." The other was Haroon Aswat, a soft-spoken, slim
Indian who seemed to spend most of his time reading the Koran. Both
have been with Abu Hamza at Finsbury Park, according to one former
mosque worshiper in London.</TE>
<TE>   The secret visit did not unfold as planned. The duo's low profile
was compromised when Osman was stopped by police for a driving
infraction near Klamath Falls. The two alleged Al Qaeda passengers
were required to present their names and passport numbers.</TE>
<TE>   At about the same time, Ujaama also drew attention from law
enforcement. On his 34th birthday--Dec. 14, 1999--Ujaama and his wife
were detained at a Wal-Mart store in suburban Renton for allegedly
stealing a $170 videocassette recorder. Ujaama since has called the
case a misunderstanding and an example of "racial profiling."
However, he failed to show up for a court hearing and a warrant was
issued for his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear from all accounts that the training camp notion never
went very far. Abu Hamza's men, apparent veterans of holy wars, were
said to be aghast. They returned to Seattle, where they lived in the
mosque for a while, shared the teachings of Abu Hamza and provided
some "urban tactical training" before departing, the indictment says.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Abu Hamza derides the notion that he would be involved in
anything so preposterous. "It's a very retarded camp in America ...
for amateurs," he said. "What are you going to train there for?...
Shooting trees like John Wayne? What can you do in America? You're
going to have tanks there? If you have 5,000 pounds [about $7,775]
I'll make you a camp in Afghanistan. But 25,000 pounds, it wouldn't
make you even anything in America.... It's yesterday's mashed
potatoes."</TE>
<TE>   The strange case of the Oregon jihad training camp initially
didn't make it into any U.S. counter-terrorism report. Ujaama
returned to London in late 1999 or early 2000, authorities say, and
went back to work for Abu Hamza. Then came Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks forced the FBI to review leads across the
country--major and insignificant. Lists of foreign terrorist suspects
and their associates were drawn up and matched against law
enforcement databases. Alarms went off when investigators discovered,
apparently through immigration entry documents and the long-obscure
police traffic stop report in Oregon, that Abu Hamza's associates had
been recent visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Intense FBI scrutiny turned to the now shuttered Seattle mosque
and anyone associated with the escapade in Bly.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of the attacks, an FBI agent was at the door of
Abdul-Raheem, the Seattle cabby. As it happened, Abdul-Raheem had
visited London the year before, staying 10 days with Ujaama at his
East London flat and having lunch with Ujaama and Abu Hamza, whom he
greatly admires.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI asked me, were they radicals, did they preach hatred,"
recalled Abdul-Raheem, who said he never heard of a training camp
plan in Bly until he read about it in the paper. "I said, 'No way.
These are men of peace.' "</TE>
<TE>   When Abdul-Raheem tried to take his wife and three young children
to London two months later, he says the FBI detained him at the
airport. Agents confronted him with an intercepted fax sent to him by
Ujaama from Pakistan offering Abdul-Raheem a job teaching computer
skills to youth in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anything about computers, but I just wanted to live
in a Muslim country and be away from all the obscenity--the
fornication, the homosexuality, the prostitution," said Abdul-Raheem,
who says he now is unemployed and has received dozens of death
threats. "He [Ujaama] wanted to help me. That's the kind of person he
is."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Seattle investigation gained impetus from
interrogations of surrendering prisoners in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Among the U.S. detainees taken to Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, was Feroz Abbasi, a young Englishman of Ugandan origins
captured while allegedly defending the former Taliban stronghold of
Kunduz. Abbasi, known in the British press as the "Croydon Taliban,"
after his home in South London, was a former computer student who was
"brainwashed" by Abu Hamza, according to his mother, a London nurse.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning, Abbasi said Ujaama introduced him to people at
Al Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan, "thus enabling Abbasi's
matriculation into a terrorism training camp," according to an FBI
internal report.</TE>
<TE>   The first arrest in the case came in May, when Osman, 32--who
"helped coordinate" the Bly camp, according to the FBI document--was
taken into custody as he turned up for his citizenship interview in
Seattle with U.S. immigration authorities.</TE>
<TE>   A search of his Tacoma apartment turned up various weapons,
military maps and field manuals, "instructions on poisoning water
sources," papers by Abu Hamza, "and various other items associated
with Islamic radicalism," according to a law enforcement summary.
Osman, a Navy reservist, pleaded guilty to a weapon charge and is
said to be cooperating, hoping to avoid deportation.</TE>
<TE>   Ujaama returned to the United States in June, via Toronto. He told
friends and relatives he was back to start a campaign against
government abuse since the Sept. 11 attacks, and planned to bring his
family to live with him in Denver. "All I need is a platform," Ujaama
told one relative upon his return.</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents followed his every move. Surveillance teams tracked
Ujaama and his brother across the Western U.S., fearing the men were
scouting targets for a terrorist strike. What they monitored,
instead, was a series of fishing holes where the brothers stopped
between Denver and Seattle. Both are avid outdoorsmen.</TE>
<TE>   "We caught a big old catfish this size," Mustafa said, spreading
his arms wide apart. FBI agents arrested Ujaama in late July at his
grandmother's former home in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Ujaama, who has pleaded not guilty and is being held in Seattle,
is accused of participating in a conspiracy to support terrorism, an
allegation that could result in a 15-year prison sentence. Ujaama
called the investigation a "fascist witch hunt" in an e-mail sent to
a Seattle newspaper. He is also charged with illegal use of
firearms--possibly a stand-by lesser charge, one official noted, to
replace the terrorism count if the former Seattle motivational
speaker decides to "come clean" and provide testimony against Abu
Hamza.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor's scenario envisions Ujaama informing on his former
London patron, a man who has helped Ujaama in more ways than one.</TE>
<TE>   In early 1999, Ujaama's temper led to an altercation at a
Seattle-area Kinko's store. Police were called and Ujaama was
arrested. He eventually pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct charges,
and was ordered to seek anger control treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Among the documents in the suburban Tukwila court where the minor
case played out is a related correspondence filed Oct. 26, 1999--at
about the same time Ujaama was allegedly promoting the jihad training
camp idea. It reads:</TE>
<TE>   "This letter is to confirm that Mr. Earnest James Ujaama has
successfully completed 16 hours of anger management classes and
counseling.... Mr. Ujaama was extremely patient, and showed kindness
and courtesy to our staff and clients [at] all times. He was
particularly energetic, outgoing, and willing to help. In short, Mr.
Ujaama was outstanding to have work with us and will be missed sorely
by all of us."</TE>
<TE>   The letter satisfied the court's requirement. It was signed by Abu
Hamza, Finsbury Park Mosque, London.</TE>

<HD>Mother in Taped Beating Says She's 'Not a Monster'</HD>
<DH>Crime: Indiana woman's 4-year-old daughter is temporarily
placed with another family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MISHAWAKA, Ind.</DL>
<LD>A mother who was captured on videotape slapping and punching her
4-year-old daughter said Saturday she was wrong to hit her child, but
said "I am not a monster."</LD>
<LD>   Madelyne Gorman Toogood, 26, surrendered to police to face a child
battery charge eight days after the nationally televised videotape
depicted her shaking and hitting the child in a department store
parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   Four-year-old Martha Toogood showed no signs of physical injury,
but the state placed her temporarily in custody of another family,
prosecutor Chris Toth said Saturday. The girl was being examined at a
hospital.</LD>
<TE>   "She's safe. We just have to, at this point, make sure there are
not any deeper physical injuries," Toth said.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a sweet, wonderful girl. Physically she looks fine."</TE>
<TE>   After being released from jail on bond, Toogood, of Mishawaka,
admitted to reporters that she was wrong to beat the child, but
criticized authorities' decision to temporarily place her daughter
with another family.</TE>
<TE>   "My child shouldn't pay for a mistake I made," she said, insisting
her husband or other extended family could adequately care for her
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a monster," she said, fighting back tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I have three children. Nothing's ever happened before."</TE>
<TE>   An arrest warrant issued Friday charged Toogood with battery to a
child, which carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison.
Earlier a judge set her bond at $5,000, although prosecutors had
requested a $50,000 bond because of her transient history, Toth said.</TE>
<TE>   Toogood, who investigators said cooperated during a one-hour
interview, was transferred to the county jail for booking, Toth said.
She posted bond and was released Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Police had been searching for Toogood and her daughter since the
Sept. 13 incident, caught on video by a surveillance camera outside a
Kohl's department store in northern Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the mother had left the store angry because she
was refused a cash refund for goods. The woman is then seen putting
her daughter in the back seat of a sport utility vehicle, then
pummeling, slapping and shaking her for nearly a half-minute.</TE>
<TE>   Toogood's attorney, Steven Rosen, said his client was angry
because her child was misbehaving in the department store. He said he
would not attempt to defend the attack because of the videotape.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear here the young lady lost her temper," he said. "I'm
not here to say she's not guilty ... She committed a shameful act.
She shall be punished."</TE>
<TE>   Rosen also criticized the girl's temporary placement with another
family, saying the Toogood family was tight-knit and traumatized by
the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, this is very detrimental, very psychologically
detrimental, bordering on abusive," Rosen said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities feared Martha Toogood might have been seriously
injured. Rosen said Toogood's family members and friends told him the
child was fine and had been examined by a doctor.</TE>

<HD>Vietnam Is No Longer Part of Iraq Equation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>One word at the center of debate over the first American war against
Iraq has been conspicuously absent in the political jostling over a
possible rematch: Vietnam.</LD>
<LD>   When Congress authorized the 1991 Persian Gulf War, many
critics--and even some supporters--warned that the face-off with Iraq
could become another Vietnam "quagmire," with massive U.S.
casualties.</LD>
<LD>   Now, even most of those dubious of invading Iraq on diplomatic
grounds are optimistic about the military outlook. As Sen. John F.
Kerry (D-Mass.), a leading skeptic, wrote recently, "There is ... no
question about our capacity to win militarily, and perhaps to win
easily."</LD>
<TE>   So prevalent is the assumption that the United States could depose
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein at relatively low cost that when
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman Gen. Richard B. Myers testified before Congress last week,
they faced only a few questions about what the war might entail--and
satisfied legislators with answers couched in the broadest
generalities.</TE>
<TE>   Such is the fruit of a string of U.S. military interventions--from
the Gulf War through Afghanistan--that have brought success with
extraordinarily low levels of U.S. casualties.</TE>
<TE>   During the debate about the Persian Gulf War "there was still the
Vietnam hangover," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). "There was a fear
we might be enmeshed in another quagmire. That concern has now been
eradicated."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the soaring confidence in the military has carried the
country into what might be called the post-post-Vietnam era.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, still in the long shadow of this country's painful loss
in Southeast Asia, Congress wrestled with two questions: Should the
United States go to war against Iraq, and could it do so at an
acceptable cost. Today, with virtually all sides assuming the answer
to the second question is yes, the nation is left debating only
whether it should intervene.</TE>
<TE>   In this conflict and beyond, many analysts say, the elimination of
the fear of failure or unacceptable levels of casualties means the
United States is more likely to use force. But it also could lead to
shock, and perhaps even rapid disillusionment, among the public if a
second Iraq war produces a surprisingly high level of American
deaths--a possibility some analysts don't rule out, especially if a
cornered Hussein uses chemical or biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "Fundamentally, the country is not prepared," said former Rep. Lee
Hamilton (D-Ind.), who chaired the House International Relations
Committee. Many people "have this extraordinary confidence in the
American military extending to the point where they think wars can be
won with minimal casualties, or none at all."</TE>
<TE>   That's mainly because the predictions of heavy costs during the
Persian Gulf War turned out to be so wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional debate that ended with authorizing the use of
force to evict Hussein's troops from Kuwait rang with warnings of
high death tolls and comparisons to the Vietnam War. The predictions
were loudest from Senate liberals most resistant to the war. "We
suffered roughly 200 casualties a week in Vietnam," Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.) said. "Yet we may well be looking at 3,000
casualties a week in the Gulf."</TE>
<TE>   But the warnings weren't confined to the left. Hawkish voices such
as Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security advisor for President
Carter, warned of "thousands of deaths among American servicemen."</TE>
<TE>   Even more fundamentally, those ominous predictions reflected
worries within the military itself, said former Sen. Bob Kerrey
(D-Neb.), who voted against authorizing the Gulf War. Military
leaders--including Colin L. Powell, the current secretary of State
who then was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--"were saying we
could take a lot of casualties," Kerrey noted.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, before the war, the Pentagon ordered 16,000 body bags.
Ultimately, 148 Americans died in combat.</TE>
<TE>   That set the mold for America's wars of the 1990s, in which the
military's reliance on air power and precision weaponry reduced U.S.
casualties to almost unimaginable levels. Just one U.S. soldier died
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and none in the air war on Yugoslavia that
forced Serbia out of Kosovo. So far, 44 Americans have died in
Afghanistan, only a dozen of those from enemy fire, according to
Pentagon figures compiled by the Center for Defense Information.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over Iraq today makes clear that in the political
world, this model of low-casualty victory has replaced Vietnam as the
expectation for what happens when Americans take up arms.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a real sea change in thinking about American
military capability," said Gary Schmitt, executive director of the
Project for a New American Century, a hawkish Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   That's apparent across the political spectrum. It may be no
surprise that conservatives such as Kenneth Adelman, director of the
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in the Reagan administration,
predict that a war to depose Hussein would be a "cakewalk."</TE>
<TE>   But even those questioning the political wisdom of attacking
Hussein in the near future express a level of confidence about the
military outcome rare in 1991. "You're looking at a couple of weeks
of bombing and then I'd be astonished if this campaign took more than
a week," former President Clinton said on CBS' "Late Show With David
Letterman" this month.</TE>
<TE>   In their joint appearances before the House and Senate Armed
Services committees last week, Rumsfeld and Myers weren't so
definitive. Asked about the prediction of a "cakewalk," Myers
bridled: "Anytime you put the lives of our sons and daughters at
risk, calling it a cakewalk is doing a disservice to them and to the
country."</TE>
<TE>   But in their answers to the few questions that touched on the
practicalities of invading Iraq, both men exuded confidence about a
quick and decisive result. Rumsfeld was most expansive when asked by
Rep. Susan A. Davis (D-San Diego) what a war with Iraq might look
like.</TE>
<TE>   "What it would look like, how long it would last is not knowable,"
Rumsfeld said. "But it is a country that has probably got military
capabilities something like 40% of what it had 10 years ago, and ours
are much more lethal. And it's got a ... military that has a pattern
of recognizing that it's better off not fighting for terribly long."</TE>
<TE>   Hardly any major analyst rejects that judgment. But some say that
another war with Iraq still could bring some unpleasant surprises.</TE>
<TE>   Ivo Daalder, a national security aide in the Clinton
administration, said that while the gap between U.S. and Iraqi
military strength has widened since 1991, several factors create the
risk of greater U.S. casualties than in the first Gulf War. These
include the possibility of urban warfare in Baghdad, the danger that
a desperate Hussein might use chemical or biological weapons and the
likelihood that U.S. forces could emerge as a target for terrorism in
a post-Hussein Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Any of those possibilities could test how completely the United
States has emerged from Vietnam's shadow.</TE>
<TE>   As Daalder noted, if Vietnam no longer dissuades U.S. leaders from
the use of force, it still reinforces their reluctance to risk
casualties--to the point where Clinton fought the Kosovo war entirely
from the air and Bush relied mostly on proxy Afghan troops even in
the cave-to-cave hunt for Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   The one time in the last decade that America suffered significant
ground casualties--during the 1993 firefight in Somalia documented in
the book and movie "Black Hawk Down"--domestic support for the
mission quickly evaporated. The level of support starts at a much
higher level for intervention in Iraq, but significant losses there
will be as unnerving to the public as in Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   "If we win [in Iraq] in the same way we've won our previous few
wars, no one will be surprised," Daalder said. "But if there is
resistance, or use of weapons of mass destruction ... those are going
to be a surprise this time, because we are not preparing ourselves as
decision makers, and we are certainly not preparing the country."</TE>

<HD>High-Tech Devices Steer Drivers to Distraction</HD>
<DH>Safety: Officials believe that up to 30% of crashes are
caused by drivers being distracted by such things as cell phones,
computers and TVs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM WASSERMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gone are the good old days of distracted driving when motorists
merely juggled coffee, shaved, read a map, drove with a pet dog in
the lap and lighted cigarettes for the miles still ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Today, millions of American drivers are taking traditional driver
absent-mindedness to new heights.</LD>
<LD>   Behind the wheel, they're talking on cellular phones, sending and
receiving pages, checking sports scores on personal digital
assistants and even sneaking a glance or two at television.</LD>
<TE>   Although the much-maligned cell phone gets the headlines for
stealing drivers' "glance time" and causing abrupt lane weaving,
experts say it's the mere tip of the iceberg.</TE>
<TE>   In California, a state that has long defined American car culture,
more commute-weary residents are loading up their interiors with VCR
and DVD players, fax machines and dashboard video screens for
satellite navigation systems.</TE>
<TE>   Experts attribute the trend to the state's legendary and worsening
traffic, which traps people in their cars for longer stretches and
further blurs lines between the office and front seat.</TE>
<TE>   And that is raising new fears among an array of authorities from
lawmakers to insurance companies of a spate of new road crashes as
more people are literally driven to distraction.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, officials believe that up to 30% of crashes are caused
by driver distractions that include mobile communications devices.</TE>
<TE>   A March report by the National Conference of State Legislatures
suggests that device-related distractions that killed an estimated
600 to 1,000 motorists in 2001 could kill 2,000 a year by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The report also cites "great potential" for even more dramatic
increases in fatalities by the decade's end.</TE>
<TE>   To those who spend most of their lives on the roads, the
handwriting is on the asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   "We see it all the time," said Leo Williams, a North Carolina
trucker who watches passengers and drivers play video games, hold
phones to their ears and work laptop computers.</TE>
<TE>   At an I-80 truck stop east of San Francisco, New Mexico trucker
Gene Smith added: "Computers. They're going down the road with a
computer on in the front seat. I see more of that."</TE>
<TE>   "You can now buy aftermarket TVs and plug them into the dash and
actually watch DVD movies," said Lt. Joel Broumas, who heads the
traffic division at the Modesto Police Department in the Central
Valley. "We stopped a kid who was driving a nice Blazer. He had one
hooked up in the dash, about an eight-or nine-inch deal."</TE>
<TE>   Academics have coined the word "carcooning" to describe how people
increasingly outfit their cars for comfort, entertainment and
productivity. Phone systems are built in. New stereos pull in
satellite radio broadcasts and play MP3 files downloaded from the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing a lot of requests for mobile video," said Doug
Kalpakoff, salesman at Wireless World in Morgan Hill, Calif. "Fewer
people are flying and more are driving. The most popular is the
drop-down screen from the roof. We see that in larger SUVs."</TE>
<TE>   Some stores, he says, now install video screens on front-seat
passenger visors. That's already alarmed some California legislators,
who proposed bills this year and last to follow the lead of New York
state and ban drivers from using hand-held cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   Both measures died after vigorous opposition by major wireless
companies, which argued that the number of wireless phone users
jumped from 10 million in 1988 to 120 million in 2002 without a huge
corresponding increase in car crashes.</TE>
<TE>   Already, cell phones, in-car electronics and radio-CD systems
represent the leading cause of inattention in crashes that killed
6,516 Californians and injured 413,913 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Those causes ran well ahead of eating, smoking, children, pets,
reading and personal hygiene. But many, including the California
Highway Patrol, which last year joined 15 states that gather such
statistics, believe that cell phone and high-tech inattention is
greatly underreported because most offenders don't admit to it.</TE>
<TE>   Auto industry spokesmen say consumers drive the demand for devices
that often distract them, and carmakers also oppose limiting "what
you can put in your car."</TE>
<TE>   But Vann Wilber, director of vehicle safety for the Washington,
D.C.-based Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, says that "it's not
a particularly precise science" between what overloads one driver and
doesn't distract another. "It's kind of a new frontier in the study
of human factors and human engineering."</TE>
<TE>   On California's I-80, Williams and Smith grouse heartily about
"the lady in the van, on the phone, smoking a cigarette, drinking
coffee, fixing her hair and taking the kids to school." But Williams
also confesses to a cell phone habit, saying, "I can't say anything.
I have one myself."</TE>
<TE>   Smith also shows what's on his front seat. "They give me my load
assignments on this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It's a laptop computer.</TE>

<HD>Auction Closes the Books on Classroom Castoffs</HD>
<DH>Schools: Bargain hunters cart off everything from
chalkboards to Xerox machines as L.A. Unified sells off unneeded
wares.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 100 home and business owners, teachers, dealers and bargain
hunters showed up at a South-Central L.A. storage lot Saturday
morning, each waiting to bid on hundreds of ghostly remnants of the
Los Angeles Unified School District's past.</LD>
<LD>   Items considered unusable, out-of-date or simply no longer needed
were auctioned off by the school district, including two green
chalkboards; piles of dusty microwaves; pots of various sizes; a few
Xerox machines; rows and rows of scratched up school desks with blue,
green and purple wads of gum stuck to the bottoms; a torn pommel
horse; a few grand pianos; a set of parallel bars; ceiling-high
stacks of bicycles; and tiny plastic children's chairs.</LD>
<LD>   "I always say 'One man's junk is another man's treasure,' " said
Quinton Dean, supervising purchasing service coordinator for the
district. "The money goes to the general fund, so everyone benefits."</LD>
<TE>   Such auctions are held a couple of times a year, Dean said, and
the district usually earns between $25,000 and $75,000 on each one.</TE>
<TE>   Inside one garage stood leftovers from high school wood-shop
classes, including a giant planer, used to finish wood, and several
machine saws. There was a variety of wood-shop, drafting and printing
equipment, since those classes have closed in recent years because of
budget cuts and schools' efforts to teach fewer vocational classes
and focus instead on state academic standards.</TE>
<TE>   Another garage held piles of worn typewriters.</TE>
<TE>   There were rows of instruments chucked from music classes: a
violin with broken strings, an electronic keyboard minus a few keys,
a xylophone, a big drum and an autoharp with "Tweedy Elementary
School" written on the side.</TE>
<TE>   There were banged up weightlifting machines, including an arm
press and a leg machine, thrown out by Belvedere Middle School. There
were golf clubs, stationary bikes, rowing machines and a tennis ball
launcher that sold for $10.</TE>
<TE>   Tina Boyd, an elementary school teacher, went to the auction to
bid on a grand piano for her home, and maybe a ladder and a
lawnmower. Boyd said she didn't care if the piano had graffiti on it.</TE>
<TE>   She also frequents thrift shops, yard sales and Big Lots stores,
and claims she is the quintessential bargain shopper.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Boyd was mentioned in a Times' article last year after
she acquired a Federal-Revival-style house for free. Boyd learned
that the house belonged to the Pasadena Christian School and was
slated for demolition, so she persuaded the school to give her the
house.</TE>
<TE>   She then paid to transport it to an empty lot she owned in
Altadena.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like traditional shopping. That bores me. I can't stand
it," she said. "I like to find unique stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Quinton Guidry, 41, took his girlfriend to Los Angeles from the
Inland Empire to browse through the pickings Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's interesting," his girlfriend, Tona Sapp, said skeptically.</TE>
<TE>   "She has expensive taste. She doesn't understand," Guidry said
with a laugh. "I'm a thrift shop, flea market type of guy."</TE>
<TE>   Guidry said he attended a Los Angeles Unified auction once before
and bought a soda machine for $25, which he now shows off in his
home. He also bought a riding lawnmower for $35. "You can't beat it,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Raffie Gevorgian, a dealer, said he attended the auction to look
for equipment to fix up and resell. But he said most items don't need
repair.</TE>
<TE>   "You should write how sad it is that sometimes they bring
brand-new stuff here, and they say it is obsolete, when our schools
have so little already," Gevorgian said.</TE>
<TE>   But Dean said schools always have first choice, and they are
welcome to come pick up the items any time, at no cost, before they
are sold to the public.</TE>
<TE>   The next public auction will probably be held after the winter,
Dean said. The district publicizes the event in newspapers and on its
Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Some shoppers, however, said they don't want the word to get out
too much, because more competing bidders result in fewer cut-rate
deals.</TE>

<HD>Boys Put to the Test in Lifesaving Effort</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Results will show whether two brothers with rare
Sanfilippo syndrome are transplant candidates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DURHAM, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Tommy Bennett spent much of his third birthday last week sedated on a
hospital bed with six electrodes strapped to his head and loud noises
clicking in his ears.</LD>
<LD>   In a nearby building, his 4-year-old brother, Hunter, was held
still by strips of medical tape so X-ray technicians could photograph
every part of his body.</LD>
<LD>   The boys' parents, John and Alicia Bennett, stood by as doctors
administered a battery of tests to determine whether they are good
candidates for experimental umbilical-cord blood transplants.</LD>
<TE>   It is the last hope for saving their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope to celebrate his 30th and 40th birthday someday," said
John Bennett, a trucker in Northern California, lying next to Tommy
on the hospital bed Wednesday at Duke University Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   The Amador County brothers and their older sister, Ciara, 6, have
Sanfilippo syndrome, a rare genetic condition in which their bodies
fail to produce an enzyme needed to metabolize sugar molecules. As
the children age, sugar builds up and causes progressive damage in
their organs, joints and brains. Most Sanfilippo patients die during
their teenage years.</TE>
<TE>   The disease has no proven treatment. John and Alicia Bennett have
staked their hopes on experimental transplants intended to provide
the children with the enzyme they lack.</TE>
<TE>   The parents know Ciara is not eligible because the disease has
progressed too far. They fear that Hunter may also be deemed a bad
candidate because he turns 5 in March, an age at which major
deterioration usually has begun.</TE>
<TE>   They will receive the results of the tests for their sons in the
next few days.</TE>
<TE>   At Duke last week, the boys were shuffled from blood work-ups to
magnetic resonance imaging, eye exams, X-rays and tests to measure
brain activity.</TE>
<TE>   Ciara, meanwhile, sat near her parents in a stroller, unable to
talk and seemingly unaware of her surroundings, a constant reminder
of Sanfilippo's destructive path.</TE>
<TE>   The Bennetts' visit to Duke was something they had dreamed of--and
dreaded--for months.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to squeak [Hunter] in, if possible," Alicia Bennett
told Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, director of the pediatric stem-cell
transplant program at Duke, who agreed that Hunter was a borderline
case.</TE>
<TE>   Kurtzberg said she wants to treat youngsters who have the
potential to develop basic skills such as speaking and dressing
themselves. That is why she is testing their brain function and
developmental status. As it stands, the Bennett boys can't speak
coherently.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't consider prolonging life enough," Kurtzberg said, even if
parents do.</TE>
<TE>   The parents did not find out that Ciara had Sanfilippo until
February 2001, after all three children had been born. The boys'
diagnosis was confirmed last February.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the boys receive the transplants, there's no guarantee
that the procedures will work. Some scientists are skeptical, based
on previous results involving Sanfilippo children who received
bone-marrow transplants.</TE>
<TE>   But Kurtzberg, one of the few doctors to explore treatments for
the disease, said she is hopeful based on the success of cord-blood
transplants in children with diseases related to Sanfilippo.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, two Sanfilippo children who underwent the procedure
at Duke more than a year ago are showing signs of progress, although
it's too soon to call the transplants a success.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative is death. Even if their boys won't lead normal, or
even semi-normal, lives, the Bennetts are not ready to give up.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Mom. I have to root for them," Alicia Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   On his birthday, Tommy was too sedated to celebrate. The day
after, his parents found a Chuck E. Cheese's restaurant in Durham and
held a muted celebration. As his father held him, Tommy tossed
miniature basketballs, grinning and giggling the whole time.</TE>
<TE>   The Bennetts had planned an all-out party for 30 relatives and
friends on Saturday at Chuck E. Cheese's in Sacramento, but it had to
be canceled because of the last-minute trip to Duke.</TE>
<TE>   Just getting to Duke was a challenge for the Bennetts. Their
insurance company, Kaiser Permanente, refused to pay for the
procedures because its doctors said there was no evidence showing
that they work. Kaiser also said that the children risked serious
complications, even death, from the treatment itself.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser's position was upheld by an independent panel of medical
experts hired by the state to review the case this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, after the Bennetts' story drew attention from
the media and state lawmakers, Kaiser gave a $1-million research
grant to Duke, with the understanding that it could be used to cover
the boys' testing and treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Before Kaiser's donation, the Bennetts had raised more than
$140,000, which will now be used for any additional care their
children need. Leftover money will be used to help other children.</TE>
<TE>   The family's story is now making the rounds at Duke, some 2,800
miles away from their home in the small town of Ione, Calif. When
John and Alicia Bennett went to fill prescriptions for the children
to ward off infections, the pharmacist asked about their insurance
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   When the father began to explain the arrangement with Kaiser, the
pharmacist responded: "Oh, you're the million-dollar boys?"</TE>
<TE>   "They have a new name here," Alicia Bennett joked.</TE>
<TE>   After almost missing their flight to Durham, the family faced a
demanding regimen of tests. Tommy, who is normally easygoing, twisted
and cried as a nurse drew his blood Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He fought like the Tasmanian devil," his father said. "He thought
they were going to kill him."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter was calm during the blood test because a nurse sang to him.
The X-rays were another matter.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just giving your knees a seat belt because we know how wild
they are," a technician said as she restrained Hunter with medical
tape. "It's not that bad, sweetheart."</TE>
<TE>   But his screams of protest could be heard down the hall. "We're
used to Hunter yelling," Alicia said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   By the family's second day in town, their hotel room looked lived
in. A nearly empty box of Dunkin' Donuts sat on the bedroom counter,
alongside a bag of Huggies diapers, a Barney DVD and a big jug of
Gatorade. None of the children is toilet trained, so diapers are a
staple wherever the family goes.</TE>
<TE>   If the boys are deemed eligible for the transplants, the family
will need to move to North Carolina for up to six months. They plan
to rent an apartment and a van, and leave Ciara with relatives and
friends back home.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well, the transplants would take place the week before
Halloween. The children's costumes--Tommy as Peter Pan, Hunter as
Captain Hook, Ciara as Tinkerbell--may not get much use.</TE>
<TE>   As their story is publicized, the Bennetts continue to receive
hundreds of donations and offers of help. Pregnant women have
volunteered to donate the umbilical cords of their babies when they
are born. A psychic wanted to cure the kids by taking them for two
hours. And a letter writer suggested a "miracle" concoction of apple
cider, warm water and vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Bennett said that with all the hasty preparations for the
trip to North Carolina, she hasn't had time to prepare herself
emotionally for the potential transplants. She speaks as if neither
boy will be turned away.</TE>
<TE>   "When we come back [for the transplants], that's when everything
is going to hit me like a wall," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband agreed. "It all happened more quickly than we were
prepared for--but we don't get that choice sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bennetts have created an online journal describing daily
developments and posting photographs. It can be accessed at

<LD>A 3-year-old girl was struck and killed Saturday night by the shuttle
bus of a nonprofit youth center based in South Los Angeles, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   Georna Lewis was hit about 7:35 p.m. as the bus traveled east in
the 1100 block of 42nd Street, Los Angeles Police Department
spokesman Jason Lee said.</LD>
<LD>   "The bus was letting off a passenger, and [she] apparently got
into the street somehow by herself," Lee said.</LD>
<TE>   The bus driver stopped and began rendering CPR, Lee said, but left
the scene to report the accident from another location after being
threatened by bystanders, including one holding a gun.</TE>
<TE>   No charges will be filed against the driver, who works for A Place
Called Home, Lee said.</TE>

<LD>A mountain biker reported missing was found dead after apparently
falling on a trail, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Daniel Gendron, 26, of Newhall was discovered by a
passerby about 2 p.m. Friday near Via Princessa and the Antelope
Valley Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Gendron appeared to have fallen off his bicycle while it was
airborne, perhaps as he was jumping a rock, deputies said.</LD>
<TE>   They believe he landed on his head and lay badly injured for
several hours. Deputies said Gendron was not wearing a helmet.</TE>
<TE>   Gendron's wife reported him missing when he did not return home
from his ride Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   He called her about 6:30 a.m. Friday to say he needed help but was
unable to describe his location. The cell phone battery eventually
gave out, Sheriff's Lt. Steve Dolan said.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy is being conducted to determine the cause of death.</TE>

<HD>Waterways to Run Clear of Trash</HD>
<DH>Environment: Crew picks the debris out of Santiago Creek
near Santa Ana to remove pollution hazards before the rainy season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's as dry as the desert and looks like a dump? The bottom of
Santiago Creek.</LD>
<LD>   Strewn with debris including computers and car parts, the creek
bed has grown unsightly and would pose a hazard if rains came and
carried the pollution to the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday about two dozen adults and children cleaned up a
section of the creek that runs by Santiago Park in Santa Ana, filling
garbage bags full of junk. Their effort was part of a countywide
cleanup of beaches and watersheds organized by the Orange County
Public Facilities and Resources Department.</LD>
<TE>   Other volunteers worked to clean up the Huntington Beach Pier,
Bolsa Chica Wetlands and other waterways.</TE>
<TE>   At Santiago Creek, Don March, 20, and Joseph Najar, 19, expressed
amazement at the junk they recovered. "Computers, car parts, shopping
carts; even a life ring. There's all kinds of stuff thrown here,"
March said.</TE>
<TE>   March, from Florida, and Najar, from Connecticut, are Mormon
missionaries in Orange County. They took the morning off to help with
the cleanup before resuming their proselytizing duties in the
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "This too is part of our service to the community," said Najar.</TE>
<TE>   Lorraine Seidmeyer, 66, surveyed a section on the north side of
the creek that had burned recently. Scorched stalks of bamboo, tall
weeds, scrub brush and even a palm tree gave the bank the look of a
charcoal drawing.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody's home used to be in there. We recovered a television,
shoes, clothing; a lot of stuff," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The cleanup was timed to pick up the garbage before winter rains
arrive. Santiago Creek feeds into the Santa Ana River, which flows to
the ocean between Newport Beach and Huntington Beach. A lot of the
garbage thrown into the normally dry creek bed and river ends up in
the ocean, pushed there by water flows caused by rain.</TE>
<TE>   Seidmeyer, a Rancho Santa Margarita resident, decided to help
after seeing a notice asking for volunteers. She and her husband,
Richard, are both retirees and frequent campers and backpackers. They
also help maintain hiking trails in South County.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't live in Santa Ana, but this is important to us. Nature
is important," Seidmeyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Dominga Torres, her two daughters and nephew turned around when
they reached the bridge at Main Street. Transients have turned a flat
area above the creek into a campsite. Pots, pans and other utensils
were stacked neatly on a ledge, above mattresses and even a small
couch.</TE>
<TE>   Another group of volunteers had filled several bags with trash
picked up from around the camp. The residents were not around.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't dare go in there," said Sandra Torres, 17, a student at
Saddleback High School in Santa Ana. "But it's kind of fun walking
through the creek."</TE>
<TE>   When the four-hour cleanup ended at noon, Lawrence Barrera, 20,
was amazed at the number of computer parts in the trash. "I guess
technology doesn't stay on the cutting edge too long before becoming
tomorrow's trash," he said.</TE>

<HD>State Bans Pornography in Prisons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN and RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>State prison officials have banned convicts from receiving
pornographic magazines and all snapshots, drawings or other
depictions of frontal nudity.</LD>
<LD>   The ban, which excludes prison-approved artistic and educational
material, followed complaints from female guards who found the
materials offensive.</LD>
<LD>   Prison authorities said some inmates have harassed female officers
with suggestive comments or by masturbating in front of them. Nude
pictures, officials said, fuel that behavior.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not a question of the inmates enjoying a little private
time in their cells. They are doing it to make the officers angry,"
said Russ Heimerich, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections.
"This is creating a hostile work environment for our female staff."</TE>
<TE>   Inmate advocates and civil libertarians call the response an
over-reaction and a violation of inmates' 1st Amendment rights. They
say the department could simply punish prisoners who misbehave or
outlaw the display of sexually explicit material.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like banning 'Catcher in the Rye' because it might induce
a prisoner to say something disrespectful," said David Fathi, a staff
attorney with the ACLU's National Prison Project in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "They're using this as a back-door way to ban publications that
don't cause any risk to prison security," Fathi said.</TE>
<TE>   The new rule also brought an angry response from the Senate
leader, John Burton (D-San Francisco), a frequent critic of the
Department of Corrections.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't they have other things to do, like make sure that people
who go to prison come out better than when they went in?" Burton
said. "I mean, give me a break."</TE>
<TE>   The ban is the latest move by California's penal system to whittle
away prisoner privileges gained under the so-called Inmates Bill of
Rights, signed by Gov. Ronald Reagan in 1968 and expanded by Gov.
Jerry Brown in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   That statute said prisoners retained all rights except those that
had to be denied to protect prison security and public safety.</TE>
<TE>   Prisoners could wear their hair as they pleased, subscribe to
almost any publication, talk freely with journalists and enjoy
overnight visits with spouses.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, however, the Legislature and Department of
Corrections began to revoke those privileges gradually.</TE>
<TE>   New rules have banned beards and long hair, removed weights from
prison yards, eliminated overnight family visits for some convicts,
and prevented inmates from profiting from their crimes by selling
their stories.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, some prisons have adopted smoking bans.</TE>
<TE>   Corrections officials say their authority to outlaw nude pictures
comes from the state penal code, which allows them to seize obscene
materials.</TE>
<TE>   They also cite a 1999 federal appellate court decision that
declared such bans permissible if they serve "legitimate penological
interests."</TE>
<TE>   That decision, by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, was made
in an Arizona case brought by an inmate challenging the Maricopa
County sheriff's ban on sexually explicit material.</TE>
<TE>   The court said that before the 1993 ban, female officers had been
harassed by male inmates who compared pictures in the magazines with
the officers' anatomy or who masturbated openly.</TE>
<TE>   After the ban, the court said, there was a sharp decline in
incidents.</TE>
<TE>   In California, corrections officials have typically allowed
inmates to receive Playboy, Penthouse and other explicit material,
censoring only highly offensive depictions.</TE>
<TE>   As the number of female correctional officers in male prisons has
increased, however, there has been a corresponding rise in complaints
about inappropriate conduct by inmates, Heimerich said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials provided no statistics on complaints. But Sheree
Ghidelli, a guard at Pleasant Valley State Prison in Coalinga, called
pornography a big problem.</TE>
<TE>   "It is posted all over the place--on their lockers, on the walls
of their cells. They even put it in their pants pocket," Ghidelli
said. "They use those pictures to [masturbate], and this is stuff I
have to come into contact with all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Heimerich said the department worries about its potential
liability if female officers sue, alleging a hostile workplace.</TE>
<TE>   "We're vulnerable," he said. "We had to take action."</TE>
<TE>   The ban took effect Sept. 10, when prison officials began
intercepting mail that violates the new rule. Any such material found
during searches of cells will be declared contraband.</TE>
<TE>   Violators are to be warned initially, then issued disciplinary
citations for repeat offenses.</TE>
<TE>   Heimerich said the ban exempts department-approved materials
deemed educational, medical, scientific or artistic.</TE>
<TE>   But critics predicted that state gatekeepers would set a high bar,
screening out legitimate material.</TE>
<TE>   "So the mailroom officer is going to decide what's educational and
artistic, and what's not?" asked Donald Specter of the nonprofit
Prison Law Office, a legal advocacy group protesting the ban.</TE>
<TE>   At the ACLU's National Prison Project, Fathi raised another
criticism: that the ban violates the constitutional rights of
publishers to circulate their materials freely.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler and several other sexually
explicit publications, agreed. In an interview, he defended his
magazines as a healthy "release mechanism" for prisoners and said the
publications have been blocked in a variety of penal systems.</TE>
<TE>   Flynt said his lawyers believe he could win a legal challenge, but
that it would cost millions of dollars. "It's not economically
feasible for me to attempt to protect the rights of these inmates,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at a handful of the state's 33 prisons, asked by The
Times, reported some "minor" grumbling over the ban. Relatives of
inmates, however, called that an understatement.</TE>
<TE>   Anita Hartman, whose husband is at the state prison in Lancaster,
said it had sparked outrage and predicted that the ban would lead to
an increase in rape and other violence among inmates.</TE>
<TE>   "Masturbation is something that people do, and if [corrections
officials] had any background in criminology or human biology, they
would realize this is a release for these men," Hartman said.</TE>
<TE>   Heimerich dismissed that analysis, saying, "There are other ways
to relieve stress--diet and exercise, cold showers, for example."</TE>
<TE>   While department officials defended the ban, some correctional
officers seemed underwhelmed by its importance. Chuck Alexander, a
vice president of the guards union, the California Correctional Peace
Officers Assn., predicted many officers would take a don't-ask,
don't-tell approach to the rule.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to tell you, as a corrections officer, I'm more
concerned about finding dope in the mail than a porno picture," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Couple in Silver Lake Outraged at Coyotes</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: After their Chihuahua is taken from their yard,
they appeal to city officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Vernasco and Kelly Hunt thought Los Angeles' scenic Silver Lake
district would be a good place to buy a home after living in a
hectic, overcrowded neighborhood near Farmers Market.</LD>
<LD>   After all, the new neighborhood would offer what they hadn't had
in the Fairfax district: panoramic views of the nearby mountains,
scenic Silver Lake reservoir across the street and a shorter drive to
downtown. They were happy to find an affordable home, because usually
one "practically has to be a millionaire to buy a house in Silver
Lake," said Vernasco, a 35-year-old bartender.</LD>
<LD>   But the good vibes evaporated on the evening of Aug. 25, the
couple said, when a coyote jumped over a 3-foot fence into their
yard, sunk its teeth into their beloved Chihuahua, Zu-Zu, and
retreated onto reservoir property with the pet in its jaws.</LD>
<TE>   The incident outraged the two. They hadn't been aware that the
area has had a growing coyote problem for 10 years. They say the city
Department of Water and Power, which maintains the reservoir, and
other agencies have done little to deal with the situation.</TE>
<TE>   In the last month, 12 complaints about coyotes in Silver Lake have
been lodged with city animal regulation officials, making the trendy
hillside community one of the most coyote-plagued neighborhoods in
Greater Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no liberty in my front yard because of the coyotes,"
Vernasco said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials, while apologetic about the incident involving the
Chihuahua, said the long-term solution isn't the coyotes' removal or
destruction in areas that were once part of their natural habitat.</TE>
<TE>   "Removing them doesn't fix the big picture," said Troy Boswell,
city wildlife officer. "Very typically, they don't stay in one place.
They jump around from one neighborhood to another. Any decent area
that can house coyotes has coyotes."</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting a prevailing attitude espoused by vocal animal
activists, who say that humans are to blame for most coyote-related
problems, Boswell said workers in the city Department of Animal
Services adhere to a policy directive adopted by the Los Angeles
Animal Regulation Commission that bans the trapping of coyotes unless
they act aggressively toward humans.</TE>
<TE>   Until 1994, city workers routinely trapped and euthanized coyotes.
These days, wildlife officers like Boswell meet with residents who
have complained about coyotes. The officers pass along information
about coyotes and suggest ways to keep them away.</TE>
<TE>   Among them are the clearing of brush and vegetation, which can
provide a hiding place for coyotes; removing pet food from outside a
home; repairing all holes or broken boards in fences; strengthening
eroding slopes under fences to prevent easy digging; and confining
pets indoors during hours when coyotes are known to be active.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, there's the admonition about coyotes: Don't feed
them.</TE>
<TE>   Even using a sprinkler can work to keep coyotes away.</TE>
<TE>   Said Tony Mcilwain, a rescuer of dogs for 25 years who is familiar
with coyotes, which come near his home next to Elysian Park: "One of
my main things is get a super soaker [sprinkler].... They're stone
afraid of humans." That's of little consolation to Vernasco and Hunt,
who have pestered city officials about the situation in Silver Lake
while obtaining two new dogs to replace Zu-Zu.</TE>
<TE>   "That coyote snatched my dog from within the walled perimeter of
my house," Vernasco said. "It's only a matter of time before
someone's baby is taken. The coyotes are urban terrorists. I mean,
we're only three miles from downtown."</TE>
<TE>   Hunt, a 39-year-old casting director, was about 10 feet away from
the Chihuahua when the coyote took it. "My last memory of her was in
the mouth of a coyote, screaming to her death and looking back at
me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple appealed to the DWP, they said, because some coyotes,
including the one that took their pet, have put down roots in the
hilly, wooded terrain at the eastern edge of Silver Lake reservoir.
Some of the holes in the wire fencing on Armstrong Avenue, where the
couple live, have since been repaired.</TE>
<TE>   They also complained to animal services officials and the office
of area Councilman Tom LaBonge.</TE>
<TE>   They said they are upset at what they consider tepid responses.</TE>
<TE>   At lease one neighbor says that anyone who lives near the
reservoir should be mindful of pests like coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Danko, 65, who lives down the street from the couple and is
a 40-year resident of Silver Lake, said coyotes have been established
in the area for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last couple of years, I have persistently told people, 'If
you got a small dog, keep it close to you or on a leash,' " Danko
said, adding that anger directed at LaBonge and other city officials
over the issue is misdirected.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Animal Services] department is horribly understaffed," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, an apologetic LaBonge vows to look into the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly want to look into it if they're aggressively acting
toward pets," the councilman said. "I'm very sorry that they lost
their pet."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's social workers were in open revolt. Foster parents
were quitting in disgust. The public was furious that a toddler in
protective custody had been returned to her parents, only to be slain
by them.</LD>
<LD>   This was the tumult Barbara Fitzgerald confronted when she took
over the county's social services agency five years ago. Fitzgerald
concedes now that the task ahead was unsettling.</LD>
<LD>   But she didn't dwell on it. She got to work. And by most accounts,
the 5-foot leader with stylish gray hair and twinkling eyes has
accomplished an impressive turnaround in an agency that provides help
for abused children, poor mothers and isolated seniors.</LD>
<TE>   Fitzgerald's calm leadership and open-door attitude have pulled
the Human Services Agency back together, supporters say. The result
is a work force doing a better job serving the area's poorest and
most desperate residents.</TE>
<TE>   "She has the toughest clients to serve," Ventura County Supervisor
Kathy Long said. "You can't do that job without feeling the stress of
it. But she has been able to build faith, loyalty and morale. And she
has been able to get everyone to focus on their mission."</TE>
<TE>   Now Fitzgerald, 57, says it's time to hand the job over to someone
else. She surprised many at the county's Hall of Administration last
week by announcing she will retire early next year.</TE>
<TE>   After 34 years with the county, Fitzgerald said she wants freedom
to travel with her college-age son and indulge a renewed
passion--painting.</TE>
<TE>   "It just has gone by in a heartbeat," Fitzgerald said. "And by and
large it's been great. But now it's time to try something else. I
tell everyone I'm going to have a second career as a famous artist."</TE>
<TE>   Her long years in social service came about by chance.</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in Madison, Conn.--"a small community where
everyone knew everybody"--Fitzgerald dropped out of college and took
off on a cross-country road trip with a girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   They wandered the country, taking waitressing jobs in Dallas and
Tucson when they ran out of money. After eight months, they ended up
in Goleta because Fitzgerald's traveling companion had a friend
there.</TE>
<TE>   When the traveling companion went home, Fitzgerald decided she
liked the look of California and stayed.</TE>
<TE>   After doing a couple of odd jobs, she applied for a $269-a-month
account clerk position with Ventura County. Fitzgerald remembers her
first day as unsettling: The man who hired her had died over the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little ominous," she said with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   Always good with numbers, she worked her way up through the
auditor's and county executive offices. She moved on to what was then
called the Public Social Services Agency, working mainly on the
business side.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way she married John Fitzgerald, a colleague in the
auditor's office, and gave birth to a son. The couple later divorced,
and Fitzgerald has not remarried.</TE>
<TE>   At the office, internal problems had been brewing for years. They
came to a head in 1996 when social workers held a news conference to
protest what they called overwhelming workloads.</TE>
<TE>   Foster care parents were also criticizing then-agency Director
James Isom as unresponsive to their frustrations.</TE>
<TE>   That year, a social worker recommended that a little girl who had
come into protective custody with broken bones, bruises and cigarette
burns be returned to her young parents. The public responded angrily
after 2-year-old Joselin Hernandez was beaten to death by her father
a few months later.</TE>
<TE>   Isom resigned in May 1997, and the Board of Supervisors selected
Fitzgerald as his replacement. Since then, she has instituted a
number of changes at the county's third-largest agency, which has a
$151-million budget and 1,050 employees.</TE>
<TE>   She reformed the process for returning children younger than 5 to
their homes after allegations of abuse. Instead of relying chiefly on
caseworkers' recommendations, doctors, police and prosecutors are now
also brought in on decisions.</TE>
<TE>   She oversaw reforms in the county's welfare programs, setting up a
system that gives aid recipients training in job skills along with a
monthly check.</TE>
<TE>   And she started an education program to help clerical staff earn
degrees in social work. She had already earned her own belated
bachelor's degree in business economics and knew how hard it was to
juggle a full-time job and classes.</TE>
<TE>   By "growing her own," Fitzgerald said, she solved the chronic
problem of social worker shortages.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest change, supporters say, was the woman herself. Where
Isom's management style could be low-key and remote, Fitzgerald's was
to listen, respond, get involved.</TE>
<TE>   "If it weren't for her, I would have quit," said Carolyn
Gyurkovitz, a Thousand Oaks foster mother.</TE>
<TE>   "We were on the verge of just saying to heck with it. But she told
the social workers, 'You will listen to your foster parents.' And if
they didn't, we would just give her a buzz and they would start
working with us."</TE>
<TE>   Employees also respect Fitzgerald because she is open and honest
with them, said Ellyn Dembowski, a spokeswoman for the local Service
Employees International Union.</TE>
<TE>   "She is just so family friendly and people friendly. I've seen her
turn around whole policies to help one person," Dembowski said. "But
when she has to say no, she says no and explains why."</TE>
<TE>   Her tenure has not always been smooth. Fitzgerald was a key player
in an ill-fated 1998 decision by the Board of Supervisors to merge
the county's mental health and social services agencies.</TE>
<TE>   A power struggle ensued, prompting a federal Medicare
investigation that eventually cost the county at least $20 million in
fines and legal fees.</TE>
<TE>   The board was forced to reverse its action, and Fitzgerald was
sharply criticized by Supervisor Frank Schillo for her role in the
debacle. Schillo said Fitzgerald and others should be fired for their
attempted "power grab."</TE>
<TE>   The two still have a chilly relationship, county insiders say.</TE>
<TE>   Other problems persist. Fitzgerald acknowledges that there aren't
enough foster homes in the county and that social workers still have
too much work to do.</TE>
<TE>   And the everyday battles against poverty, abuse and departmental
budget cuts can be wearying, she admits.</TE>
<TE>   When she feels the cynicism creeping up, she tries to remind
herself of the good, Fitzgerald said.</TE>
<TE>   "The stories I hear, the successes and the struggles, remind me
why we are here," she said. "We are by no means solving all of their
problems. But we are making a difference."</TE>
<TE>   The county will begin the recruitment process for the
$130,000-a-year job next month, said County Executive Officer Johnny
Johnston. He said he hopes to have someone in place well before
Fitzgerald's March 29 departure.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald's advice to her successor?</TE>
<TE>   Get a life.</TE>
<TE>   The job can be consuming, so it's important to have an outlet to
relieve the pressure, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She turns to her family, to theater and to painting, something she
has done since childhood but took up with a fervor seven years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In a studio at her Ventura home, she fills silk canvasses with
bursts of vibrant color. They are the hues of Tahiti, Thailand, Costa
Rica--lands she has seen and hopes to visit again with her
18-year-old son, Stephen.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a few more adventures left in me," she said.</TE>

<HD>Campaign Underway to Recruit Foster Parents</HD>
<DH>Shortage: County social workers hope to have 350 families
by 2005 to fill a growing need for homes for children.</DH>

<LD>The 7-month-old Santa Paula girl had two broken legs and a family in
chaos. But when she was ready to leave the hospital this month,
social workers had to scramble to find a foster family that would
accept her.</LD>
<LD>   This kind of situation occurs all too frequently in Ventura
County, social workers say. The shortage of foster care has prompted
county officials to launch a three-year campaign to encourage
residents to open their homes to abused or endangered children in
need of temporary shelter.</LD>
<LD>   The county has 160 foster homes, down from 363 in 1991. About 40
children enter foster care each month, and about half as many leave
the system to be reunited with their parents, live with relatives or
be adopted.</LD>
<TE>   County Department of Children and Family Services statistics show
that Oxnard needs 52 more foster homes; Ventura, 29; Santa Paula and
Fillmore combined, 14; Port Hueneme, 14; Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park
and Westlake combined, 10; and Moorpark, 10.</TE>
<TE>   "People aren't aware of the need and sometimes they're scared away
by what they believe these children are like," said Ventura County
Juvenile Court Judge Charles Campbell, a key supporter of the
recruitment effort.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just kids like everyone else. We're trying to get the
word out to people that they should be responsible for the children
in their community."</TE>
<TE>   Because there aren't enough foster homes in many county cities to
meet the demand, children are often placed in homes far from their
parents and schools. This makes education, visitation and family
reunification all the more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   If a foster home cannot be found, the children are sent to Casa
Pacifica emergency shelter in Camarillo or one of two temporary homes
contracting with the county that will keep a child for up to 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   But the county wants to place children into a nearby foster home
as quickly as possible, one that can keep them as long as needed.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to have choices and options so we can best match
children to homes," said Trish Cavanaugh, foster care administrator
for Children and Family Services. "What happens now is [that] a child
may come in and we have one bed available for that age and sex, and
it may not be the best place for them."</TE>
<TE>   The local foster care shortage parallels a sharp decline
nationally, caused largely by economics, Cavanaugh said. With many
more two-earner families, parents have fewer hours to spend with
their own children, much less someone else's, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, county social workers and their supporters believe
they can make a dent in the problem by appealing to people who never
before thought about being foster parents or who considered it but
hesitated.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope to have a roster of 350 licensed foster families by
2005 after county workers and volunteers visit churches, professional
organizations, parent-teacher associations and civic groups to seek
recruits.</TE>
<TE>   The shortage is most acute among Latinos, who comprise 52% of
children in foster care but only 8% of foster families, Cavanaugh
said.</TE>
<TE>   The county places many Latino children in homes that may not
reflect their cultural needs, Cavanaugh said. If the children speak
only Spanish and their foster families don't, a difficult situation
is worsened, she said.</TE>
<TE>   To combat that, the department recently hired a bilingual
recruiter and a bilingual foster-care ombudsman to encourage and help
Latino families "take care of their own," Cavanaugh said. The county
also plans to place Spanish-language radio ads, and use other
marketing and public relations tools.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran foster parents will serve as mentors to new foster
families, helping them adjust to their roles.</TE>
<TE>   "Just knowing that you've helped out a child when they really
needed it is a wonderful thing," said Simi Valley resident Mariana
Abarta, a foster parent for 16 years. She and her husband, Steve,
parents of three adult children and a teenager, are caring for their
38th and 39th foster children.</TE>
<TE>   Because Abarta is a registered pediatric nurse, the couple chose
to foster medically fragile infants who had been abused or were born
to drug-addicted mothers.</TE>
<TE>   "Drug babies almost always have long-term effects, because you
just don't know what to expect from the drugs--when the mother took
the drugs, how often or how much," Abarta said. "I'm a good, safe
place for them."</TE>
<TE>   To become a licensed foster parent, applicants must attend an
orientation, complete 12 hours of training and have their homes
inspected by a social worker. Families receive $425 to $600 a month
per child to cover necessities, such as food and clothing, and $50 to
$250 more for special needs, such as transportation to medical
appointments.</TE>
<TE>   Officials launched the recruitment effort in May in the Santa
Paula-Fillmore area, which had one foster family. Since then, four
have signed up, Cavanaugh said. The goal is to get 15 foster families
in the Santa Clara River Valley by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell, who is devoted to guardianship and adoption issues, said
he has become increasingly aware of the trauma caused by uprooting
abused or neglected children from schools and friends.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these kids get put in foster homes that are nowhere near
where they live when they are removed from their parents. They have
to go to a new school with no continuity in class. That's just
incredibly disruptive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They generally come from homes where they haven't had a good
upbringing, and they have no resources or resiliency to deal with
these kinds of setbacks. They're at a significant disadvantage to
succeed in school. And if they don't do well in school, we know
what's coming next."</TE>
<TE>   As the outreach effort proceeds, county social workers are making
do. They found a foster family in Santa Paula to take in the injured
7-month-old girl. But Cavanaugh worries that other children will not
be as fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't do our work for the children unless the community helps
us," she said.</TE>

<HD>Jewish Group Is Quick to Answer Any Call for Help</HD>
<DH>Volunteers respond to medical problems from scraped knees
to heart attacks in the Fairfax and Mid-Wilshire areas.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zvika Brenner went to a North Hollywood synagogue for the funeral of
a man he never knew.</LD>
<LD>   As a fellow Orthodox Jew, Brenner wanted to pay his respects to
the stranger--Yaakov Aminov, a Valley resident who had been gunned
down at Los Angeles International Airport by an Egyptian immigrant at
the El Al Israel Airline counter on July 4.</LD>
<LD>   Aminov's pregnant widow, Anat, fainted during the funeral.
Brenner, a certified emergency medical technician, helped revive her.
The burial was to be held in Israel, Aminov's homeland, but Anat was
unfit to travel alone and her doctor could not accompany her.</LD>
<TE>   At a moment's notice, Brenner decided to accompany Anat Aminov on
a flight to Israel. He had only the clothes on his back and his bag
of medical gear.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to a funeral and ended up coming back three days later,"
Brenner said. "But sometimes, when life is at stake, you drop
everything, because life takes priority."</TE>
<TE>   Brenner, 51, is president of an Orthodox Jewish volunteer EMT
corps known as Hatzolah, or "rescue" in Hebrew. It is the only such
service in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the nonprofit group work in the heavily Jewish
Mid-Wilshire and Fairfax areas, racing from their regular jobs on
short notice to handle medical situations ranging from scraped knees
to heart attacks. On occasion, they go above and beyond the call of
duty, as in Brenner's unexpected trip to Israel with Anat Aminov.</TE>
<TE>   Hatzolah volunteers "are very special people," Anat Aminov said.
"I felt very protected that he came with me," she said of Brenner.</TE>
<TE>   Though Hatzolah is not intended to replace the city's emergency
medical system, its members live or work in the square mile they
serve and can usually respond to calls in less time than Los Angeles
Fire Department paramedics.</TE>
<TE>   "We can do anything from deliver a baby on the street to saving a
gunshot victim," said Chaim Kolodny, the group's operations
supervisor. "But the first question we always ask is, have you called
911?"</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles operation, started a year ago, was the brainchild
of Kolodny, a rabbi and director of Los Angeles Cheder day school in
Hancock Park. He was once an EMT for Hatzolah of New York, the first
Hatzolah, which was established 25 years ago. Today there are about
25 Hatzolah groups worldwide, from South Africa to Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Hatzolah of Los Angeles started out modestly, with 15 volunteers.
They were mostly people with ordinary day jobs who were not certified
EMTs, but they knew basic techniques, such as CPR.</TE>
<TE>   The group now has a 24-hour hotline staffed by 10 women
dispatchers and 30 men who are Los Angeles County-certified EMTs. A
non-emergency number--(323) 931-6453--provides information on
Hatzolah's coverage area. It also has a Web site, www.hatzolah.org.</TE>
<TE>   Hatzolah volunteers, including Kolodny, made news in August when
they alerted police that a man resembling the composite sketch of a
suspected serial rapist was prowling Hancock Park. The police
arrested the man and say he is responsible for four sexual assaults
in the neighborhood since July.</TE>
<TE>   Though Hatzolah is completely funded by the Jewish community--with
a $100,000 budget--its services are available to anyone in the
service area.</TE>
<TE>   Hatzolah volunteers--like other EMTs, whose training is a step
below a paramedic's--cannot prescribe medicine or use syringes.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike their New York counterparts, they do not take patients by
ambulance from an emergency scene to the hospital. But they are
trained in such things as taking a patient's vital signs,
administering cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and using an automatic
defibrillator to revive someone in cardiac arrest.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles group's first year, the volunteers responded to
about 100 calls, most of them not life-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   Hatzolah volunteers also bridge the cultural and linguistic gap
that may separate non-Jewish emergency workers and Jewish patients.
Kolodny said many Jews in his neighborhood are Holocaust survivors
who may speak only Russian, Hebrew or Yiddish.</TE>
<TE>   "It's helpful having Hatzolah on scene to do translations," said
Daryl Arbuthnott, chief of LAFD Battalion 18 in the Wilshire-Fairfax
area. Some Jewish patients "have their own unique customs and beliefs
that we're not necessarily attuned to. They can calm patients down."</TE>
<TE>   The cultural insight is especially important when emergencies
arise during religious holidays or on the Sabbath, when observant
Jews do not work or drive.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Brenner said, some Jews may not want to drive or go
to the hospital, even in a possible emergency.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone is in a life-threatening situation, they may then only
feel comfortable calling us, and we are then allowed to attend to
that patient," Brenner said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hatzolah of Los Angeles now serves only one neighborhood
in the city, its founders hope to expand to other areas. Their next
big project involves a partnership with New York Hatzolah to organize
300 volunteers who would be ready to fly to Israel within 48 hours in
the event of a war.</TE>
<TE>   For the volunteers, the motivation to drop everything and be
available 24 hours a day is simple:</TE>
<TE>   "We don't do it for the pat on the back," said Kolodny's wife,
Shoshana, who is a radio dispatcher. "This is what we love to do."</TE>

<HD>'Hillside Strangler' Dies at 67</HD>
<DH>Obituary: Angelo Buono Jr., who murdered nine L.A. women in
the 1970s, is found dead in prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angelo Buono Jr., one of the "Hillside Stranglers" who terrorized Los
Angeles by torturing and killing nine women in the late 1970s,
carefully arranging their bodies in roadside patches of weeds to
taunt police, died Saturday alone in the prison cell where he was
serving a life sentence.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at Calipatria State Prison near Palm Springs believe
that the 67-year-old Buono died of natural causes. He had suffered
from heart problems in the past and there were no signs of trauma on
his body, said Bob Martinez of the state Department of Corrections.</LD>
<LD>   For more than two years, Buono and his cousin Kenneth Bianchi
roamed the streets of northeast Los Angeles and Glendale, sometimes
flashing fake badges to lure their victims.</LD>
<TE>   They were all killed in Buono's Glendale automobile upholstery
shop.</TE>
<TE>   It started with a part-time waitress and prostitute, found Oct.
18, 1977 lying face-down in bushes beside busy Forest Lawn Drive near
Barham Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   By the time one of the most highly publicized killing sprees in
Los Angeles history ended, the victims ranged in age from 12 to
28--women and girls representing a cross-section of the city. The
dead included two schoolgirls, a college student, an aspiring actress
and a dancer.</TE>
<TE>   The case spawned a 162-member law enforcement task force, which
chased countless tips and bits of information that seemed to lead
nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Each new death brought bigger headlines in Southern California and
across the country as then-Police Chief Daryl F. Gates held weekly
press conferences.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a horrible, horrible time, a time of great fear for the
people of the city, especially for women," Gates recalled Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The number of victims, the way they were tortured and the way
Buono and his accomplice prominently displayed the bodies in popular
areas frustrated investigators and horrified the public.</TE>
<TE>   "When the crimes were going on and on and were unsolved, there was
a real feeling of terror--nude, strangled women showing up dead on
various hillsides," said California Supreme Court Chief Justice
Ronald M. George, who as a Los Angeles Superior Court judge presided
over the two-year trial that ended in late 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Charles Manson murders a decade earlier and the Night
Stalker killings in the next decade, the specter of the Hillside
Stranglers put people on a fear-filled edge.</TE>
<TE>   The killers had handcuffed their victims. They injected them with
caustic fluids. A plastic bag with a stove's gas pipe inserted into
it was put over one woman's head. All had been sexually assaulted.</TE>
<TE>   "Young women were absolutely terrified to go out after dark," said
Robert Philibosian, who at the time was a top prosecutor in the state
attorney general's office, which had assumed control of the case.</TE>
<TE>   The case was ultimately cracked when Bianchi implicated Buono.
Bianchi had been arrested in Washington state in connection with a
rape and strangulation case there.</TE>
<TE>   He eventually pleaded guilty to five of the murders in California
and is serving a life term as part of his plea bargain for testifying
against Buono.</TE>
<TE>   Buono was convicted of killing Judith Lynn Miller, Elissa Kastin,
Jane Evelyn King, Dolores Cepeda, Sonja Johnson, Kristina Weckler,
Lauren Rae Wagner, Kimberly Diane Martin and Cindy Lee Hudspeth.</TE>
<TE>   When told of Buono's death, Philibosian responded: "Oh, good! ...
God works in mysterious ways. The death penalty has finally been
administered by a higher power than the County of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The case spawned a TV movie, a book and several documentaries, in
part because of its bizarre aspects and the clever killer behind
them.</TE>
<TE>   Buono would clean up the bodies before posing them at prominent
sites, includes the hills near the Los Angeles Police Academy.</TE>
<TE>   One victim was carefully laid out on a hillside near downtown Los
Angeles, her legs forming a "V" that framed City Hall and Parker
Center, the LAPD's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Chaleff, who defended Buono, said people often ask how he
could have taken on such a client.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is entitled to a defense, even those charged with the
most heinous of crimes," said Chaleff, who is now a senior advisor to
City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo.</TE>
<TE>   The trial included testimony from 392 witnesses and 1,807
exhibits. Its transcript ran almost 56,000 pages and charted new
legal territory.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, it was the longest-running trial in the nation's
history.</TE>
<TE>   In a surprising twist, then-Dist. Atty. John K. Van de Kamp, along
with defense attorneys, asked Judge George to dismiss all of the
murder charges against Buono.</TE>
<TE>   Van de Kamp believed he had a better chance to keep Buono off the
streets by convicting him of sex charges, given the highly
circumstantial evidence before him.</TE>
<TE>   In what George said has been among the most difficult and
controversial decisions of his career, he refused that request.</TE>
<TE>   "I concluded I was not supposed to be a rubber stamp for the
prosecution," George said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I had an obligation to determine what was in the best interest of
justice."</TE>
<TE>   George believed there was a "web of circumstantial evidence that
was quite strong," and that the murder charges deserved to be
presented to a jury.</TE>
<TE>   He then took the case away from the district attorney and turned
it over to the office of then-Atty. Gen. George Deukmejian, whose
prosecutors ultimately persuaded a jury to convict Buono of nine out
of 10 counts in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Judge George believes that one lasting legal legacy of the case
"is that it reaffirmed my faith in the jury system."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors spared Buono from the gas chamber and sentenced him to life
in prison without the possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   Chaleff, who said he consulted with rabbis and priests before the
penalty phase, called the jury's decision "what we had strived for."</TE>
<TE>   Chaleff has not had contact with Buono since then.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors did not tell George why they rejected the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   At sentencing, George said to Bianchi and Buono that he wished he
could send them both to the gas chamber instead of prison for the
rest of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the two of you are incapable of feeling any remorse,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Housing Market in County Still Red Hot</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Sales in August are the strongest of the year,
fueled in part by a nearly 25% increase in the price of condos since
2001.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The run-up in Ventura County's housing market continued unabated last
month, as home sales and prices increased to near record levels and
even condominiums were selling quickly at a hefty markup.</LD>
<LD>   "Sales for August were the strongest so far this year," said
analyst John Karevoll of DataQuick Information Systems. "And the only
reason they're off a little from last year is because we had one more
business day last August."</LD>
<LD>   Although prices are rising and sales are strong, Karevoll said the
20% year-to-year price increases seen in 2002 are likely to slow.</LD>
<TE>   "It'll probably go down to 12% to 15% by the end of the year, but
the prices are still going to go up," he said. "There's no indication
that they have plateaued."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, median home prices countywide have remained about the
same for three months, in the low to mid $330,000s, according to
DataQuick. The median is the point where half the dwellings sold for
more and half for less.</TE>
<TE>   But Karevoll said this apparent leveling of price reflects the
type of dwellings sold, not a price trend: Many more condos were
purchased last month than the month before, up from 374 in July to
420. Condos typically sell for much less than single-family homes,
thus the median price increased only $3,000 from July to August and
was $1,000 below the record of $335,000 in June.</TE>
<TE>   Condo prices marched upward at a rate even faster than the market
overall, increasing 24.5% in 12 months to a median price of $238,500
last month, DataQuick reported.</TE>
<TE>   "There are only 24 condos available in Ventura, and you'd be
surprised at the prices," said Karen Campbell, president of the
Coastal Assn. of Realtors, which represents agents in six west county
cities. "They range from $174,000 to $485,000."</TE>
<TE>   The median selling price of all types of homes has risen so
sharply--by $54,000 in a year and $144,000 since 1995--that some
appraisers now hesitate to confirm the higher value as required by
banks to complete a home loan. That can either force sellers to lower
the price or compel buyers to increase the size of their down
payments.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a willing seller and a willing buyer, but the appraisal
comes in too low, so the lender has to back off," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   One of Campbell's deals, a $380,000 sale of a three-bedroom home
in north Oxnard, is being held up because an appraiser valued the
house at $350,000, she said.</TE>
<TE>   New sales figures from Campbell's association--which accounts for
about one-third of the county's total sales--suggest that the market
may not be as strong as DataQuick's numbers indicate.</TE>
<TE>   While DataQuick reported a slight year-to-year decline in sales of
2.9%, the west county association reported a sales drop of
single-family homes and condos of 15%. DataQuick counts a sale when
escrow on a property closes, while the realty association counts a
sale as occurring when a deal is first signed.</TE>
<TE>   While sales were off in the west county, properties turned over
more quickly than a year ago. Single-family homes sold in 33 days on
average, compared with 48 in August 2001. Condos were on the market
about 18 days before selling, about half the time of a year ago,
according to the west county association.</TE>
<TE>   Countywide, DataQuick reported that sales of houses and condos
totaled 1,698 last month, up 77 from the month before, but 50 lower
than the previous August. That represented the second strongest sales
performance for an August since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   After last month's slight increase, Ventura County's median home
price was up $50,000 since January.</TE>
<TE>   The market remains strong countywide, although sales were off in
upscale Oak Park, where prices for a typical house dipped by $10,000
to $405,000 compared with August 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers in Newbury Park saw the price for a typical house increase
$109,000 to $440,00 compared with last year; the price of houses sold
in Ojai were up $102,000 to $426,000, and prices in Moorpark
escalated $101,500 to $364,000.</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore registered the largest percentage price increase, 45.3%,
as buyers paid a median price of $300,000 in August.</TE>
<TE>   Eastern Ventura continued a huge run-up in sales prices, from a
median of $299,000 one year ago to $401,000 last month.</TE>
<TE>   Agents said that the continued decline of mortgage interest rates
is fueling the boom. Fixed home-loan rates reached 30-year lows or
hovered near them last week.</TE>
<TE>   A shortage of homes currently on the market also contributes to
high prices.</TE>

<HD>Jewish Gay Cop Makes an Impression but Fails to Make Cut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So you're Jewish, you're gay, you're a Democrat, and it's time to
make a career choice in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   No problem. Must be tons of options, and way, way, way down the
list, somewhere beneath pro hockey player and Navy SEAL, is LAPD cop.</LD>
<LD>   Against all reason, that's the job David Kalish wanted 27 years
ago at the age of 22, and nobody was going to talk him out of it.</LD>
<TE>   "My family wasn't thrilled," he says, and at that point, they
didn't even know he was gay. There just weren't a lot of young Jewish
men holstering up for the Los Angeles Police Department. "They said,
'Why not be an attorney, like your cousin?' "</TE>
<TE>   Because all Kalish ever wanted to do was get behind the wheel of a
black-and-white, even after he signed on in the mid-1970s and felt as
out of place as a straight man in a seminary. Kalish kept his
homosexuality secret and stuck it out, which wasn't always easy
(details in a minute).</TE>
<TE>   He rose through the ranks to deputy chief, and last week,
anticipation building, the man who once hid his true identity from
9,000-plus officers, and more than once had them gunning for him,
waited nervously to find out if he might be their boss.</TE>
<TE>   "They can take me or leave me," he said over coffee at a Starbucks
on La Brea the day before a field of 13 candidates was cut to three.
"But I hope they take me."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't hard for me to find people in the know who thought
Kalish was one of the best candidates, and probably the strongest of
the six within the department. USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky
said he was dazzled by the depth of Kalish's reform plan, which
begins with a redistribution of manpower.</TE>
<TE>   For example, it makes no sense to Kalish that only 207 officers
work gangs in a city with 407 gangs and 56,000 known gangsters who
run drugs, terrorize neighborhoods and lure kids into a world where
the bullets never stop flying.</TE>
<TE>   Kalish has been everywhere in the department, too. Street patrol,
terrorism, gangs, investigations, personnel, community affairs,
South-Central, Hollywood, the Valley, LAX.</TE>
<TE>   But some cops and civilians rolled their eyes when I asked about
Kalish as a possible successor to Bernard Parks. It was as if I'd
suggested that Tommy Tune ought to head up the invasion of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, sure, they said. The LAPD might not be quite the macho
Marine unit of old, but is it ready to fall in line behind an openly
gay chief?</TE>
<TE>   As alternative lifestyles go, Kalish does cover a lot of ground.
He is the biological father of a 3 1/2-year-old son who essentially
has two fathers and two mothers, as Kalish describes it. The second
father is Kalish's Asian Buddhist partner, and on the mom side is a
lesbian couple that brings a Latina, white and Catholic perspective
to Junior's kaleidoscopic world.</TE>
<TE>   All five members of the Rainbow Coalition went to a Dodger game
last week, and if this isn't L.A.'s postmodern poster family, the boy
ought to at least get free Dodger dogs.</TE>
<TE>   The leadership question is actually a fair concern, given the
rock-bottom morale in the LAPD and the need to make the right
decision this time on the top cop. So I asked Kalish if he thought a
gay chief might have trouble getting the full support of the troops.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I'm either incredibly naive or just not based in reality,
but I believe they don't care about it, to tell you the truth," he
said. "These cops today are too sophisticated to be concerned with my
religion or orientation. What they want is a leader who knows them,
understands them and respects them. I believe that in my heart."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always that simple. When Kalish came out of the academy,
he had no option but to keep his mouth shut about which way he
leaned.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a requirement," he said. "It was survival. That was 27
years ago, and people were terminated for it."</TE>
<TE>   On what grounds?</TE>
<TE>   "Fill in the blanks."</TE>
<TE>   Kalish would be cruising along with a partner who started in on
some gay-bashing screed and have to make a decision. Should he try to
broaden his pal's horizons, or nod like a Neanderthal?</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he did some of both.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some tough times," he says, and it takes a few tugs
for me to drag more out of him.</TE>
<TE>   "Vice cops used to stake out my house to see who was coming and
going at night," he says. "And some false complaints were initiated
against me."</TE>
<TE>   But that's all he cared to say about it, partly because he wanted
to be seen as a good career cop who wanted to be chief, rather than
as the gay candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, I don't like to play the oppression Olympics. A lot of
people have had to overcome things, and I've never been one to let
artificial barriers stand in my way. Being a cop was my lifelong
ambition, and I just happened to be born gay. But this is a truly
great job and I love this organization."</TE>
<TE>   Kalish said he quit hiding his private life about 10 years ago. He
never held a press conference or anything, "but it's been known
within the department." Anyone who missed it might have been clued in
last month, when Kalish had sort of a coming out in a San Francisco
Chronicle article.</TE>
<TE>   "The chief of police is a critically important, high-profile job,"
Kalish explains, saying he agreed to the story because he didn't want
to hold anything back. "I just thought it was the right thing to do,
because this is who I am."</TE>
<TE>   The call on the final three candidates came Thursday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Kalish didn't make the cut.</TE>
<TE>   Two members of the Police Commission have since called him, saying
he made a big impression and has a bright future with the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Kalish thanked them, but he's upset that the commission picked
three outsiders, showing no confidence in the applicants from within
the department.</TE>
<TE>   His department.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like being punched in the stomach," he said, and in the
next breath he repeated that he's got to get over it. He wouldn't
want to work anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   The day before the decision, I asked Kalish a question. If he got
passed over, would it be because he's gay?</TE>
<TE>   He smiled and said, "We'll never know the answer to that, will
we?"</TE>

<HD>Council to Decide Fate of 4 Old Oaks</HD>
<DH>Roads: The trees are targeted for removal in project to
make Tujunga intersection safer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty oaks they are, old and silent. But they are on the verge of
being toppled by the swift flow of progress.</LD>
<LD>   In this case, progress means making room for cars.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Council will decide whether to
move forward with a $1-million road improvement project in Tujunga
that will destroy four large old oaks and perhaps imperil the
remaining 10 in a half-acre grove whose leafy canopy may have shaded
settlers on horseback.</LD>
<TE>   Oaks are protected by law in Los Angeles and many other cities.
L.A.'s ordinance allows the trees to be removed if they interfere
with road improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The city has budgeted $935,000 to widen and realign the
intersection of Honolulu Avenue, Tujunga Canyon Road and La Tuna
Canyon Road, near the Foothill Freeway. The junction has a history of
accidents, many involving motorists coming down hilly Tujunga Canyon
Road too fast and failing to negotiate a curve past the oak trees,
spinning out into the property of a homeowner who lives across the
street from the grove.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned that city engineers might not have tried hard enough to
save the 14 oaks, Councilwoman Wendy Greuel put a two-week freeze on
the project funds Sept. 10. She asked city engineers to detail what
alternatives, such as using an adjacent right-of-way to bypass the
trees, have been investigated.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to have to be very clear and explain this to me in
writing," she said. "Safety is a top priority of mine. But removal of
oak trees of this size and stature should be a last resort."</TE>
<TE>   City engineers say that removing four trees to make the curve more
gradual is the only way to improve safety along the stretch where
Tujunga Canyon Road meets Honolulu. Plans also call for building
retaining walls around some of the other oaks, which some experts say
could kill the sensitive trees.</TE>
<TE>   Project manager Masih Hashemi said every effort was made to avoid
destroying trees. "To my knowledge, there are no alternatives," he
said. "We didn't take this lightly at all."</TE>
<TE>   Edwin Bowen, who has lived in a house at the intersection for 40
years, doesn't favor reworking the project to avoid uprooting the oak
trees. His 1.5-acre property is a catch basin for vehicles coming too
fast down the hill on Tujunga Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   "We have lots of accidents at that corner," said the 71-year-old
commercial contractor. "I think the widening is more important than a
couple of trees."</TE>
<TE>   City officials were unable to explain why there are no warning
flashers or large signs to alert drivers to the curve as they come
downhill on winding Tujunga Canyon Road, although oversize arrows are
posted on curves going up the hill.</TE>
<TE>   "I would agree that [warnings] could result in some reduction of
accidents," said Rand Disko, a city engineer who helped design the
project. A sober driver going the speed limit should have no trouble
making the bend around the trees, he said. But the reality is that
the spot has too many accidents, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The solution is to have a gradual enough turn so that the
motorist can remain safely in their travel lane," Disko said.</TE>
<TE>   From June 3, 2001, to June 11, 2002, 11 accidents at the
intersection were recorded by the Los Angeles Police Department. Four
were solo-car crashes, five were two-car collisions, one vehicle hit
a bicycle, and one motorist hit a parked car.</TE>
<TE>   Bowen said he believes the number of accidents is far higher, but
many aren't reported. "We have one a week, I'd say."</TE>
<TE>   City engineers said the roadbed can't be shifted to an unused
right-of-way on Tujunga Canyon Road farther away from the oak grove,
because doing so would not soften the curve.</TE>
<TE>   The use of retaining walls within a few feet of most of the
remaining tree trunks will probably damage their sensitive roots and
could prove lethal, said Doug McCreary, a tree physiology expert with
the University of California's hardwood management program.</TE>
<TE>   Although the city will plant at least 10 oak saplings nearby as
replacements for the four oaks being removed, McCreary said it's not
the same as having old trees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hard to replace the values associated with big oaks,"
he said. "They are tremendously important to wildlife and one of the
richest habitats in the state. They're a very distinctive part of the
landscape. I think they're emblematic of California to many people."</TE>

<HD>Let El Toro Airport Die in Peace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you don't count the 67 columns since 1993 devoted all or in part
to the El Toro airport debate, I've kept quiet on the subject. And
why not; I never cared whether they built the thing or not.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, however, my legacy will be that El Toro is the single
subject about which I've written the most. As a sensitive yet
tortured artist more attuned to other themes, I can't tell you how
painful that realization is.</LD>
<LD>   When is enough enough? When will someone tell the players the game
is over?</LD>
<TE>   A Los Angeles Superior Court judge tried last week when he ruled
that the ballot measure in March that scuttled the airport was not
deceptive and should stand. Two days later, Gov. Gray Davis sank a
bill that would have pressured counties to build or expand airports,
declaring that Orange County voters had made up their minds on El
Toro.</TE>
<TE>   You all remember Measure W, don't you? Orange County voters passed
it 58% to 42%, voting in the Great Park plan and voting out the Great
Airport plan. True, it was but the latest of four countywide votes on
an El Toro airport since 1994 (the first two in favor of the airport,
the last two against), but this one was considered the final word.</TE>
<TE>   As it should be.</TE>
<TE>   Can we have some closure, people? A candlelight vigil, if
necessary? A group hug?</TE>
<TE>   You can understand the pro-airport side's aversion to giving up.
To them, an airport at El Toro, which has runways in place from its
military days and enough space to build a state-of-the-art facility,
was heaven-sent. Plus, they argued, the county would need expanded
air travel capacity in the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County and an El Toro airport--happily ever after.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that, how could pro-airport forces possibly give up on
their plan--especially for something as squishy as a park?</TE>
<TE>   It's like the guy hit with divorce papers who suddenly realizes
his wife is about to marry someone else. He doesn't want to give up
the marriage because he knows he and his wife are a good match. If he
can just drag things out a bit, he thinks, she'll come to her senses
and come back. Once she remarries, he knows she's gone for good.</TE>
<TE>   That's what airport supporters see. Voters not only have asked for
a divorce, they want to remarry. And once a park starts taking root
on the former Marine base, the airport is gone forever.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. judge realized that, too. After breaking it gently to the
pro-airport side with his ruling, he said: "Any time you have
emotions that run so deep, there are going to be hard feelings. I
assume there are going to be appeals."</TE>
<TE>   Time for the airport crowd to suck it up. They have to admit it's
over. They've lost the voters, and they aren't coming back.</TE>
<TE>   Not an easy thing to do, because, like a lot of spouses, they've
misread why they lost. Ever since Measure W surfaced, the airport
crowd argued that Orange County voters were being hoodwinked by the
good-looking stranger. They argued that the park would never be built
or that, if it were, it'd cost a fortune.</TE>
<TE>   What they couldn't or wouldn't admit was that the new Great Park
suitor wasn't the problem. The problem was that, in the face of an
appealing new alternative, they never convinced a majority of voters
that an airport was a better choice. Or even essential.</TE>
<TE>   Given South County intransigence against an airport, perhaps they
never had a chance. Who knows? We do know that the airport side once
had the voters but eventually lost them.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Great Park proves a perfect fit for Orange County
remains to be seen. The airport supporters may be right in saying the
county has been suckered.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't matter. At this point, that lament is no more relevant
than the cries of the deposed husband as his ex-wife stands at the
altar with Hubby No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Like that poor slob, the classy thing for the airport crowd to do
now is wish the winner well and silently walk away.</TE>

<HD>Off to See the Angels in Baseball Heaven</HD>
<DH>Sports: With the team on verge of playoffs, fans camp out
for days at the Big A for tickets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The campout for Angels' tickets was not for the fainthearted.</LD>
<LD>   Fairweather fans were well advised to stay away.</LD>
<LD>   If you're the type who hates waiting in any line, you were wise to
avoid this one.</LD>
<TE>   Only the bravest Angel fans mastered the system, snatching up
red-hot tickets Saturday morning to see the red-hot Anaheim Angels in
their first playoff appearance in 16 long-suffering years.</TE>
<TE>   More than 5,000 people packed the parking lot at Edison
International Field on Saturday, including some who had camped out
since Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of others jammed Ticketmaster phone lines and the
Internet, trying to buy divisional playoff tickets. They were sold
out by 3 p.m. Internet sales were actually cut off at 10:15 a.m., so
fans at the park would have a better chance of getting tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Winnetka resident Alan Senseman, 43, was at the head of the line.
He arrived at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday, armed with two sleeping bags, two
jackets, a change of clothes, cigarettes and a wad of cash. The
longtime fan had no intention of leaving the tickets to chance, or
his temperamental computer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tired. I'm burned," said a disheveled Senseman. "Don't get
too close--I'm even smelling myself."</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes of the box office opening at 9 a.m., Senseman was
grinning broadly while camera crews captured the purchase. Fans
whooped in the background as he held up the payoff: a handful of
tickets to three home playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   Some people, lamenting that they didn't arrive sooner, punched the
redial button on their cell phones in pursuit of better seats through
Ticketmaster.</TE>
<TE>   As a morning fog burned off and the sun rose over the Big A, the
atmosphere was festive. Winchell's handed out free doughnuts. Radio
station DJs poured free coffee and passed out cereal, red and white
beads, and plastic cups.</TE>
<TE>   Fans savored every moment. They've been waiting since 1986 for the
Angels' to make a return trip to the playoffs. That year, they were
one strike away from a trip to the World Series, when Dave Henderson
of the Boston Red Sox hit a heartbreaking home run, spoiling the
Angels' chances.</TE>
<TE>   This year's team, which has won a record-setting 96 games, has a
good shot at the World Series title.</TE>
<TE>   Their play inspired thousands to flock to Edison Field. Some, like
Senseman, were there Wednesday and Thursday, but most started
arriving on Friday, turning the parking lot into a sea of tents.</TE>
<TE>   After hours of intense bonding and maybe a few beers, members of
the crowd had become friends. They shared hamburgers and breakfast
burritos, held each other's places in line while some snuck home for
a shower, and stumped each other with Angels trivia questions.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Coppage, 22, of Cherry Valley--No. 105 in line--came alone
Thursday night. By Saturday morning, he was leaving with friends he
planned to keep in touch with, including La Palma pals Missy
Bustamante, 17, and Laura Hanson, 18.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's see," Coppage said, "Laura likes horses. She's going to
finish her general education. She doesn't know what she's going to do
with her life."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and did he mention he's been sick? "Really," he said, "I had
the flu," adding that he hoped his boss wouldn't figure out the real
reason he missed work on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The fans agreed that it was an unforgettable experience--all the
way down to the overflowing Porta Pottis. They regaled late arrivals
with tales of the "caped crusader" who circled the tents late into
the night with shouts of "Go Angels!" There were air horns blasting,
people calling radio stations with song requests from the parking
lot, and a few shouting matches with a few Yankee fans who dared to
wear their baseball caps.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Castaneda, 20, of Anaheim said he partied until 3 a.m. only
to return to the spot held by his family.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a couple of singles checking me out. I ain't gonna
lie," he said. But his cousins pointed out the real score. Castaneda
came back alone.</TE>
<TE>   As the fans awoke Saturday after their night of partying, the
moment they have been waiting for drew one day nearer.</TE>
<TE>   "All roads to the World Series are going through New York--and
Anaheim," John Kelly, 43, of Fullerton said. "God, it feels weird
saying that. We've been with them through all the bad years. This is
pretty exciting."</TE>

<HD>A Breakthrough for the Breakers?</HD>
<DH>Innovation: Dana Point surfer's bizarre board is just the
thing for those who live for the edge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the dusty beach parking lot, the Don Quixote of the surf world
opens the back doors of his rusty Ford van and pulls out a surfboard
that looks like a giant bowling pin sliced down the middle.</LD>
<LD>   "What is that?" asks a startled passerby at San Onofre State
Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Where does inventor Bob Howard start? He tosses out the
surfboard's name: the Flat Fish Noserider. He takes the gawker
through the prototype's bizarre design and enthusiastically explains
why it allows a surfer to virtually camp out on the nose of the
board, hangin' 10. And he points to the beach where Josh Froley sits,
telling the stranger that the pro surfer is intrigued by the
potential and will be taking the board out for another test ride in a
few minutes.</LD>
<TE>   What doesn't have to be said between the two wave riders is why
this is all so important. They both have felt the ecstasy of standing
on the nose of a board, zooming along a wave with nothing in front of
them but a blue wall of water.</TE>
<TE>   If Howard's backyard invention can extend those moments by a few
seconds--an eternity on a wave--the Flat Fish Noserider could join
oversized tennis rackets, graphite-shafted golf clubs and aluminum
baseball bats in revolutionizing a sport.</TE>
<TE>   "We need this innovation to keep surfing alive and interesting,"
said Tom Wegener, a well-known board shaper and surf-movie maker from
California who now lives in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "The big manufacturers and shops hate and fear the backyard
builders because they ... challenge their cushy, easy, relatively
thoughtless existence," Wegener said.</TE>
<TE>   But the gap between unconventional genius and obsessed kook is
admittedly thin, and at this point, not even the good-natured Howard
is sure which side he falls on, eight years into his quest to revise
standard surfboard design.</TE>
<TE>   He is sure about one thing: He won't stop, even with the maxed-out
credit cards and snickers from the guys on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "My mind's on fire," says the 54-year-old Dana Point
resident.Innovations in surf equipment have been made ever since
Polynesians began catching waves with 175-pound planks of hardwood.
But after the short board was introduced in the 1970s, radical
assaults on the surfboard's basic design have been few.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach's Jeff "Doc" Lausch piqued surfers' curiosity
this year--he developed a fast short board by using a keel instead of
fins, giving it the look of a stealth bomber. It's called the
Unidentified Surfing Object, or USO.</TE>
<TE>   Howard, however, isn't interested in speed--only in keeping a
surfer's toes on the nose. It's the signature move, the slam-dunk, of
long-boarding. The trick to hangin' 10 is making the board's tail
stays in the water--not too easy when more than 150 pounds is
standing on the nose. Usually, this can be done a few seconds at a
time after the surfer maneuvers to the top of a breaking wave, where
the cresting water pins down the back of the board.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years ago, Howard began to tinker with ways to gain hang-10
time. A surfboard designer told him about the Coanda effect, a
physics principle that says water or air will follow a curved
surface, creating suction in the process. That suction creates lift
for an airplane wing--and, Howard figured, could help hold down a
surfboard so its rider could perch longer on the nose.</TE>
<TE>   That was the idea behind his 1994 invention, the Koanda Noserider,
a half-dome piece of fiberglass roughly the size of a small bicycle
helmet that a fits over the surfboard's fin to create a vacuum.</TE>
<TE>   Howard got a marketing break that first year when long board
legend Izzy Paskowitz used the Koanda to get a 16.5-second nose-ride
in a Ventura contest. Other maverick surfers were also impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "I was absolutely amazed by the way it worked," Wegener said. "It
hasn't caught on because surfers are the most conservative people
around and change is not smiled upon. The days of invention ended a
quarter century ago."</TE>
<TE>   After seven tough years of marketing snafus, $6,000 in credit-card
debt and a divorce, he put the device on the shelf, though it's still
available at his Web site (www.noseriding.com).</TE>
<TE>   "I don't drink, smoke or gamble," says Howard, who makes a living
writing employee newsletters for the Boeing Co. "I spent a few
thousand dollars, but I had a million bucks' worth of fun."</TE>
<TE>   Remarried and still obsessed with hangin' 10, Howard got to
thinking: Forget the attachments; why not design a nosing-riding
surfboard from scratch? He created three miniature prototypes out of
balsa wood last year and tested them in his special wind tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   "I drove down Pacific Coast Highway at 60 mph and put my arm out
the window with the boards," he says. "I really got a feel of which
design held down the tail."</TE>
<TE>   And he also ran a series of water tests last winter, when rains
created ideal miniature surf conditions in the gutter outside his
home.</TE>
<TE>   The winner was the most radical design, which resembles a halibut
more than a surfboard. Howard's theory is that water will rush down
the sides of the board and wash across the top of the tail, forcing
down the back of the board.</TE>
<TE>   Since Howard discovered he was "too fat and too old" to test his
invention, he enlisted pro surfer Josh Froley three months ago as a
test pilot.</TE>
<TE>   "It nose-rides like crazy," Froley says after a half-dozen surf
sessions with the new board. "I almost blew off the back, it's so
fast."</TE>
<TE>   But the prototype has problems--mostly in its lack of
maneuverability. After each test, Froley and Howard compare notes and
make adjustments, including moving the fins away from the end of the
board.</TE>
<TE>   Howard still needs more test runs before he will try a revised
design with a large, blank piece of foam that sits in his garage--the
beginnings of his second prototype.</TE>
<TE>   If the funky board becomes the new Hula Hoop for long-boarders,
Howard says he'll partner with a major surfboard manufacturer--but
he'll share his secrets with anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe in patents in surfing," he says. "It's not in the
spirit of surfing, which is about being one with nature and God."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Morey, creator of the Boogie Board and other surfing
innovations, is familiar with Howard's quest.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob's a heck of a nice guy, and somehow he's gotten a fixation on
making the world's greatest nose-rider," says Morey, a Dana Point
resident. "That's a nice goal, and I hope he does it."</TE>
<TE>   But Morey says if Howard's creation works, it will raise a
philosophical dilemma for long-boarders: "The question is: If you
make something that everybody can ride right up on the tip of it,
then what have you got? If it's real easy, there is no goal."</TE>
<TE>   For surfers like Howard and Froley, the joy of wrapping their toes
over the nose of a surfboard is a feeling everyone should experience.
"It's hard to explain if you haven't done it," Froley says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the water goes right up through you--you're part of the
ocean."</TE>

<HD>Vietnamese Classes Set a New Course</HD>
<DH>Education: Garden Grove Unified offers language instruction
at two high schools this fall. Some see it as a chance to bridge a
generation gap.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a reason Peter Nguyen wants to improve his Vietnamese. The
high school senior from Garden Grove can't seem to win an argument
with his Vietnamese immigrant parents.</LD>
<LD>   "They have an advantage over me because they speak the language,"
said Nguyen, 17, who understands Vietnamese but can barely speak it.
"I don't have the vocabulary to express my side."</LD>
<LD>   That's about to change.</LD>
<TE>   He is enrolled in Bolsa Grande High School's first Vietnamese
class. The course is part of a pilot program Garden Grove Unified
School District officials hope to develop into a regular elective on
par with the district's French, Spanish and Latin programs.</TE>
<TE>   The district introduced the course this semester at Bolsa Grande
in Garden Grove and La Quinta High in Westminster after years of
lobbying by parents and students.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that interest, and the largest Vietnamese American student
population in the nation--28%, or about 11,000 students--school
officials were concerned in early summer that the Bolsa Grande class
wouldn't attract enough students. Only 18 had enrolled by July,
whereas La Quinta had 30, the minimum required.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, officials now say, might have been a lack of
advertising and that incoming freshmen didn't sign up until August.
Word got out in local newspapers and on a Vietnamese language radio
station. By the time school started, Bolsa Grande had 35 students,
and La Quinta 's roster had grown to 37.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen and his Vietnamese American classmates say learning the
language is a way to bridge the cultural gap with their parents. It
is also a chance to strengthen their heritage.</TE>
<TE>   "For me," said Mylynn Tran, 14, a freshman, "because of my Asian
background, not knowing the language--it was kind of sad."</TE>
<TE>   Vietnamese parents and students had clamored for such a course
since the mid-1980s. Westminster High School was the first to
respond, in 1999. The Huntington Beach Union High School District
school now has more than 100 students studying Vietnamese and offers
advanced-level courses.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove school officials hope to offer advanced courses
eventually, but starting a foreign language course from scratch can
be daunting.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the students during the first day of class, 'While you are
learning, I'll also be learning,' " said Hannah Nguyen, Bolsa Grande
High's Vietnamese teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen, 31, is also an English teacher at the school. She came to
the United States from Vietnam at the age of 1. She learned
Vietnamese at home and at church while growing up. Providing classes
at school, she said, gives more students the opportunity to learn the
language.</TE>
<TE>   One student taking that opportunity is Jaime Garcia, 14, who is
one of a few non-Vietnamese pupils in the class.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a community where there are a lot of Vietnamese
people," Jaime, whose parents are from Mexico, told his classmates.
"When I get a job that I can help people, I want to be able to speak
their language and understand their culture."</TE>
<TE>   The class paused for a beat, and broke into applause.</TE>

<HD>Faring Well in Dry Spell</HD>
<DH>* Water: Thanks to increased capacity and reduced
per-capita usage, Southland is weathering the drought much better
than the rest of the West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long chided by politicians and environmentalists for its
water-hogging ways, Southern California is withstanding the current
drought better than many other Western cities--partly because people
are using less water for everyday tasks.</LD>
<LD>   Though a four-year dry spell has severely shrunk Denver's
once-grand reservoirs and so parched Santa Fe, N.M., that the City
Council is debating a prohibition on new development, things here are
comparatively rosy.</LD>
<LD>   The last so-called rainy season in Los Angeles was the driest on
record. California's snowpacks--the source of most of the state's
water--were below average for the third straight year. Yet, with few
exceptions, residents can use as much water as they please to soak
their lawns, wash their cars and hose down anything else in need of a
drenching.</LD>
<TE>   Southern California has doubled its water storage capacity in the
last decade. Served by a massive plumbing system of vast reservoirs
and hundreds of miles of aqueducts, the region is probably two years
away from any water rationing even if the current dry spell persists,
water officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas most cities have one or two sources of water, Southern
California taps local aquifers and three distant locales--the rivers
of the San Francisco Bay Delta, the Eastern Sierra and the Colorado
River. That water is stored in reservoirs capable of holding four
years' worth of water for the region.</TE>
<TE>   And in the past 30 years, per capita water use in Southern
California residences and businesses has dropped steadily. Although
Los Angeles has grown by more than 1 million people since 1970, the
city still uses the same amount of water as it did then.</TE>
<TE>   According to numbers compiled by the American Water Works Assn.,
the average resident of Los Angeles uses 140 gallons of water a day.
By contrast, Phoenix residents use 184 gallons per day, Denver 228,
Salt Lake City 284 and Las Vegas 307.</TE>
<TE>   Near Las Vegas, Lake Mead's level is 73 feet below capacity, and
the Southern Nevada Water Authority is going to toughen its drought
restrictions this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe, meanwhile, is experiencing the worst drought in the
city's history. "The cupboards are bare," said Albuquerque Mayor
Martin Chavez after a judge ordered the city to leave water in the
Rio Grande for an endangered minnow.</TE>
<TE>   In Colorado, the primary reservoirs serving Denver were 99% filled
two years ago. The system is now 52% filled, the lowest it has ever
been. In the spring, the area's water situation went from good to bad
to worse in a matter of weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Bad to Worse in Denver</TE>
<TE>   First, a low snowpack in the Rockies produced only a trickle. At
the same time, the weather turned warm prematurely, and Denver
residents began watering their Kentucky bluegrass lawns two months
earlier than usual. Then the largest wildfire in Colorado's history
sent tons of sediment into one of the city's primary reservoirs,
rendering much of its water unusable.</TE>
<TE>   "Denver Water had done such a good job for 80-plus years of
providing adequate water at a reasonable price, and there was not ...
a compelling reason before this for people to cut back," said Liz
Gardener, manager of the Denver Water Department's conservation
program. "At first it just seemed like another dry year."</TE>
<TE>   All outdoor watering in Denver will be curtailed as of Tuesday.
Things have become so bad that an ad campaign by the Water Department
earlier this year implored citizens to wash "only the stinky parts."</TE>
<TE>   Californians have faced worse, just not recently. Adan Ortega,
vice president of external affairs for the Metropolitan Water
District, said it is unlikely the region will suffer like Denver
anytime soon. That, Ortega said, "is because of forethought and
planning."</TE>
<TE>   In the last 20 years, both of the region's largest water
providers--the MWD and the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power--have steadily pushed residents and businesses to install an
array of water-saving gadgets. Even those who criticize Southern
California for its sprawl and siphoning of water from distant places
concede that the two agencies are pioneers in getting customers to
conserve and offering them ways to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Flush With Success</TE>
<TE>   The MWD is about to pay its 2-millionth rebate for the
installation of an ultra-low-flow toilet, a program the agency
credits with saving at least 18 billion gallons of water since the
late 1980s. Denver dropped a similar program in the mid-'90s because
officials said it wasn't cost-effective.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP and MWD have asked customers to use low-flow shower heads,
and they offer rebates for efficient washing machines; the MWD is
even trying to lure businesses to invest in "water brooms" that
people can use to conserve water while cleaning sidewalks. The region
leads the nation in recycling water for outdoor use--about 68 billion
gallons in the 2001-02 fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Berk, a professor of statistics and sociology at UCLA's
Institute of the Environment, co-wrote a study in the 1990s that
found people in Los Angeles were more likely than San Francisco
residents to own water-efficient devices and to be more water
conscious.</TE>
<TE>   "To my great surprise, we stacked up as well, if not better, than
the Bay Area," Berk said. "I expected the opposite--we'd be the bad
guys, and they'd be wonderfully green."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Gewe, the DWP's assistant general manager for water, said
conservation has given Los Angeles the ability to better withstand
hits to its water supply. He said that in recent years the city has
lost a third of the water it once took from the Owens Valley because
of environmental commitments.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we've been able to weather that without the public
having to pay much attention to it is because of conservation," Gewe
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to make more gains, the MWD's next big push is to persuade
customers to use drought-resistant native plants in their yards. Part
of that campaign, which officials say they will roll out in coming
months, will ask residents to stop over-watering lawns and gardens,
which Ortega said consumes enough water to supply the city of San
Diego for a year.</TE>
<TE>   "They've never told people what to plant in their yard before at
MWD," said Mary Ann Dickinson, the executive director of the
California Urban Water Conservation Council. "This is a big, bold
step for them.... They're saying let's try something we haven't tried
before."</TE>
<TE>   Some experts nevertheless question whether the MWD and DWP are
doing enough to persuade their customers to save water. They say the
area must prepare for the inevitable prolonged drought and the
eventual loss, due to a federal agreement signed in 2001, of vast
amounts of surplus water that Southern California has for decades
been taking from the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   'A Lot of Work Ahead'</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of work ahead of us to change the behavior of users
here," said Malissa Hathaway McKeith, a Los Angeles attorney who
served on the Colorado River Board of California for five years. "The
Colorado River surplus is like a Band-Aid someone is going to pull
off."</TE>
<TE>   Some, such as McKeith and Berk, argue that the MWD and DWP focus
too much on water-saving devices instead of pressuring people to
adopt less wasteful habits. Many environmental groups believe the
average household could easily cut usage by 10% each year if people
simply paid more attention to how long they run the water.</TE>
<TE>   Agencies contend that because changing people's habits is
difficult, it's best to not ask for the big sacrifices until
absolutely necessary. And, there are those who contend that Southern
California has been the lucky beneficiary of a number of
extraordinarily wet years in the late 20th century that allowed the
region to keep growing. The late Marc Reisner, who wrote the book
"Cadillac Desert," contended that farmers and urban areas were living
on borrowed time if they didn't rein in their prolific use of water.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Mulroy, general manager of the Southern Nevada Water
Authority, is not a doomsayer but sees lots of room for improvement
in Las Vegas and in Southern California--both of which rose from
desert. To her, the real issue is sustainability.</TE>
<TE>   "There is this raw human will that has developed in the West to
overcome natural conditions," she said. "We think we can build our
way out of anything, but as we keep growing, we're going to run up
against a wall."</TE>

<HD>Arcata Project Is Flush With Fish</HD>
<DH>Science: University study uses wastewater to raise
oceangoing freshwater trout, which have been found to be hardy and
healthy.</DH>

<DL>ARCATA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A soft odor of raw sewage permeates the air, competing with the
sharper salt smell of the Pacific Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   Humboldt State University student Mike Shoemaker tosses fish food
pellets into two wastewater ponds, which burst into a simmering boil
as nearly 10,000 steelhead trout and coastal cutthroat trout roil to
the surface.</LD>
<LD>   Shoemaker is wearing a "Flush with Pride" T-shirt, featuring a
fish leaping out of an open toilet -- the official logo of the Arcata
Wastewater Aquaculture Project.</LD>
<TE>   It's believed to be the only one in the world studying the use of
wastewater to grow oceangoing freshwater fish, although studies
elsewhere have centered on everything from catfish to carp.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are really hardy fish, where trout are really known to be
sensitive. So a lot of people don't even try it, but we haven't found
any problems," said Kristine Brenneman, a Humboldt State fisheries
biologist who also heads the city's wastewater utilization program.</TE>
<TE>   The sewage-raised trout emerge clean of all the nasties, including
significant levels of cholera and fecal bacteria, Brenneman said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, research by graduate student Andrew Jensen found that
steelhead hatchlings raised in wastewater filtered through the
treatment center's marshes grew significantly larger, were more
likely to survive and had fewer abnormalities than those raised in
Arcata's drinking water, which picks up higher copper levels while
passing through pipes.</TE>
<TE>   Wastewater, by contrast, "is very high in nutrients," Brenneman
said.</TE>
<TE>   The research holds potential for hatcheries that grow great
numbers of notoriously finicky salmon and steelhead to replenish
natural stocks, Brenneman and Jensen said.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, the university releases into the wild several thousand
wastewater-raised fish that aren't needed for research.</TE>
<TE>   But the thought of using wastewater to raise fish that people may
eat is innately troubling to Americans, Brenneman acknowledged,
although other cultures have used human waste for fish and fertilizer
for centuries.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Interior sent representatives to inspect
the project this spring, and Minnesota flew out observers last
summer. Other hatcheries have also toured the program.</TE>
<TE>   If wastewater-raised fish never catch on in the United States, the
research could help in other countries that have a scarcity of water
and protein, Jensen said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all controversial," Brenneman said. "We just do the
experiments; if anyone wants to do it commercially, they can."</TE>
<TE>   Until a few decades ago, cities saw nothing wrong with pumping raw
sewage into wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   Since the mid-1960s, however, state and federal governments have
gone to great lengths and expense to protect wetlands from sewage.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, Arcata residents were confronted with plans for a new
sewage treatment plant that would drastically raise their sewage
rates. So they proposed building their own plant that would use the
marshes to help filter wastewater before spilling it into Humboldt
Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Research by Humboldt State University professor emeritus George
Allen, who started the aquaculture research project in 1971, helped
persuade the state that the marsh treatment was not only safe, but
beneficial.</TE>
<TE>   All the fish died during Allen's first attempt to raise coho. By
1977, however, he successfully released 12,000 coho, some of which
returned to spawn as adults. He continued experimenting through the
late 1990s, with increasing success, although the program has since
switched from endangered salmon to steelhead and cutthroat.</TE>
<TE>   But proposals for "ocean-ranching" salmon at the wastewater
treatment plant were rejected because of opposition from commercial
fishing and environmental groups, as were previous proposals by two
commercial fish-hatchery projects, Allen writes in a trilogy of
reports titled "Aquatic Hoop Dreams Revisited."</TE>
<TE>   Arcata's pioneering use of wetland filters for wastewater,
completed in 1986, has since spread worldwide, wherever it's warm
enough so the marshes don't freeze in winter.</TE>
<TE>   The system was several times cheaper than the proposed mechanical
sewage treatment system that Arcata residents rejected. And with it,
Arcata got a wildlife and recreation area frequented by bird
watchers, joggers and dog-walkers, and thousands of waterfowl.</TE>
<TE>   Through the mid-1990s, Allen hosted annual fish barbecues where
his students snacked on their research subjects with no ill effects.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the only ones eating the wastewater-raised fish are
otters that sampled the captive population until researchers
installed netting and an electric fence to keep them out.</TE>
<TE>   Although Shoemaker is satisfied that there is nothing wrong with
the fish, he and other researchers still can't stomach the idea of
eating them.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not because the fish have grown up in human waste.</TE>
<TE>   It's because after raising the fish from eggs to adulthood, he
said, it's as if "they're your children."</TE>

<HD>Tribe Forgoes Law in Quest for Salmon</HD>
<DH>Fishing: Karuk men have handed down the netting method to
their sons for generations. They hope to keep the tradition alive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON THOMPSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOMES BAR, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Bare-chested, his thick braid trailing midway down his back, Rony
Reed straddled a slick boulder at the edge of Ishi Pishi Falls while
balancing an awkward 18-foot-long dip net.</LD>
<LD>   He is one of little more than a dozen veteran Karuk tribal
fishermen keeping alive a tradition passed from father to son for
thousands of years.</LD>
<LD>   It's practiced now in a gray area of the law.</LD>
<TE>   No one officially keeps track of the 2,000 or so salmon that the
tribe can take in a good year, despite all the lawsuits and the
millions of dollars spent to monitor and replenish the seasonal
salmon runs on northwest California's Klamath River and its
tributaries. In a bad year, the second largest tribe in California
can catch as few as 400 fish.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, their fish are not even 'paper fish,' " said Neil
Manji, a senior fisheries biologist for the California Department of
Fish and Game. "Anything they catch, it's kind of like ghost fish."</TE>
<TE>   Federal legislation that would have legitimized the tribe's salmon
catch fell victim to the Klamath Basin farmers' water crisis last
year. The tribe hopes to try again soon.</TE>
<TE>   Around the time of the Gold Rush, the Karuks were herded into the
Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation with the Hoopa and Yuroks near the
mouth of the Klamath.</TE>
<TE>   The tribe's nearly 3,200 members have long since migrated back
upriver to their ancestral riverside homes in the Klamath Mountains
as far east as Yreka, but get no percentage of the three tribes'
official salmon allocation.</TE>
<TE>   That has caused tension between the tribes, although they
haveunited in a common fight to get more water from Klamath Basin and
Central Valley farmers.</TE>
<TE>   It also led occasionally, since the 1960s, to Karuks being
arrested for fishing illegally, although that hasn't happened since
the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Given the religious and political land mines, neither the state
nor federal government has been eager to block the Karuk's fishing.
But while the tribe keeps track internally, its salmon take isn't
officially recorded.</TE>
<TE>   "Then it would have to come out of somebody's allocation
somewhere," said Leaf Hillman, the tribe's natural resources
director. "No one talks about it because no one wants to deal with
it. People have been satisfied for many, many years to pretend the
issue doesn't exist."</TE>
<TE>   The Karuk culture is centered on Ishi Pishi Falls, where the
rushing Klamath River narrows for a quarter of a mile and creates a
natural barrier to salmon migrating to the ocean or upriver to spawn
and die. It's the only area where the tribe now takes its fish.</TE>
<TE>   The falls are created by the sacred mountain that the Karuks call
Auich and others call Sugarloaf.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the cradle of our civilization, where we came from when
humans were transformed," Hillman said.</TE>
<TE>   The tall, wooded bluff is home to Duck Hawk, a peregrine falcon
that watches over the world in tribal teachings. A falcon shrieked
out its call repeatedly as it circled overhead, which Hillman
considered a good omen.</TE>
<TE>   But Reed's dip net soon broke, before he could catch a spring-run
salmon. He tried again to demonstrate with an 11-foot-long net used
to teach a child. It too soon broke against the rocks as he jammed it
into the frothing whitewater.</TE>
<TE>   The fall salmon run is best now, Reed said. On a good day, in a
good year, a veteran netter can catch a hundred salmon, working to
exhaustion. That far exceeds the legal three-fish daily catch for a
single fisherman, but traditionally it makes sense for the tribe to
send its best fishermen to catch as many as they can.</TE>
<TE>   It's a man's job, by tradition. It's considered taboo -- and bad
luck -- for a woman even to observe the fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Most salmon are given away fresh; tribal tradition calls for the
fisherman to share his catch with whomever asks, even if that means
splitting half a fish. The remainder is smoked into jerky, Reed said:
"They call that Indian candy."</TE>
<TE>   "When my sons were babies, I took them down to the falls," Reed
said. "It's been handed down from generation to generation --
thousands of generations."</TE>
<TE>   His youngest son, 2-year-old Ramy, recently learned one of his
first words: "aama," Karuk for "salmon."</TE>
<TE>   His 7-and 8-year-old sons will begin practicing with short nets
this fall. His older sons, ages 16 and 17, are studying the fishery
this summer as part of a junior biologist program. His 14-year-old
daughter is learning traditional ways at cultural camps.</TE>
<TE>   "We're teaching our children as best we can," Reed said.</TE>
<TE>   Harold Tripp is one of the tribe's master fishermen at age 51.</TE>
<TE>   As a child, he learned from his elders how to cut 18-foot-long fir
poles and lash them into a frame, how to bend supple white oak
branches over a fire to form a three-foot hoop at the end of the fir
poles, and how to string within that hoop a 6-foot-long cone-shaped,
hand-tied cotton net.</TE>
<TE>   The rig becomes absurdly heavy when sopping wet and containing a
flopping 30-pound salmon. So a second man, called the "clubber,"
stands by the fisherman's side ready to grab the fish -- and the
fisherman, if he starts to slide into the swirling rock-strewn
rapids.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be smarter than the fish, is what they told me when
I started," Tripp said. "You've got to be sneaky because they see
you, they hear you, they know you're there."</TE>
<TE>   As important is learning "the medicine" -- private prayers,
spiritual and physical preparation before fishing begins, often
accompanied by sprinkling herbs on the water.</TE>
<TE>   "This all ties into our religious beliefs because we believe we
have to get fish to our people," Tripp said. "It's a spiritual
connection -- it's a spiritual food."</TE>
<TE>   Tripp is passing on the traditions, and the medicine, to his own
son now. Phillip, 11, already has caught 11 salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Despite legal questions over the tribe's fishing, Tripp and others
believe that they have no choice.</TE>
<TE>   "From the beginning of time, we've always fished here," Tripp
said. "Our religious beliefs are if we don't eat some of the fish,
there won't be any more fish.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to rely on faith -- we do our medicine and we catch our
fish," he said. "My grandmother told me as long as one person
believes, we're still going to be out here."</TE>
<TE>   In August, the Karuks gathered near their sacred falls for a war
dance over the river's future -- but a war dance with a difference.
Non-tribal community members, environmentalists and anyone who wished
were invited to attend, as they have been the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   "Before you go to war, you try to figure out how not to go to
war," Reed said.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, enemies would repeatedly challenge each other
within the fire-lit dance circle, he said, "and you don't walk away
from the dance until you have a solution."</TE>
<TE>   Reed and his sons were among the dancers donning feathers and war
paint as brother challenged brother, father challenged son, friend
challenged friend, symbolically working through conflict and toward
unity.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, everybody jumps out there [together], dancing and
praying to the Creator," Reed said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're basically praying to the Creator to make things right along
the river," he said. "We're asking the Creator for guidance and
wisdom to carry on our traditions, and deal with contemporary
problems."</TE>

<HD>Angry Davis Defends Fund-Raising</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>One day after canceling a controversial fund-raiser, an angry Gov.
Gray Davis defended the way his campaign solicits donations and said
that he does not support events that raise money by targeting
specific industries.</LD>
<LD>   The Democratic governor said that was why his campaign had called
off a Friday night fund-raiser at the home of Rod Diridon, a Davis
appointee who heads the California High Speed Rail Authority, after
newspapers reported that Diridon had invited builders and other
advocates of a high-speed bullet train.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, who signed a bill Thursday asking voters to approve a
$9.9-billion bond to construct the bullet train, said he had not been
aware that the fund-raiser at Diridon's Santa Clara home was for
people who could financially benefit from the costly public works
project.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't have a problem with a general event to which everybody
is invited," Davis told reporters Saturday during a swing through
Oakland, where he attended a rally with union supporters and signed
several bills to protect consumers from predatory lending.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't like people targeting specific industries,
particularly if they happen to be an appointee who has any influence
whatsoever over those industries," added the governor, whose tone
grew increasingly testy as he fielded questions about the matter.
"That was the case, so we said we're just not going to let that
happen."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, however, Davis has attended fund-raisers sponsored by
specific industries or interest groups. In August, he was feted by
the agriculture industry the night before the Legislature approved a
bill bitterly opposed by farmers that would impose binding
arbitration when unions and growers cannot agree to a contract. The
governor has yet to take action on that legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said that often people within the
same industry attend a fund-raiser because individual hosts invite
their business acquaintances. But he said those events are different
from ones that target donors with specific interests in projects or
bills.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fund-raisers are not policy forums," Salazar said. "Based on
what we heard and read in the paper [about the Diridon event], it
seemed to cross that line. That obviously was inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' challenger, Republican nominee Bill Simon Jr., has seized
upon the Diridon fund-raiser, calling the governor unethical and
accusing him of "auctioning off state policy to the highest bidder."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Davis reacted heatedly to Simon's charges. The
governor said his rival is guilty of "the worst kind of political
corruption" because he is loaning his campaign $9 million and
repaying that debt with contributions made after the election.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Simon has no business lecturing me," said Davis, appearing
incensed. "You can look at what I've done and judge it against what
actions I've taken. But at least you'll know on election day who's
giving money to my campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Simon advisors noted that the Republican candidate has promised to
donate any money he raises after the election to charity.</TE>
<TE>   The governor is "hiding behind false and misleading attacks to
cover up his scandal-ridden administration," said Simon's campaign
spokesman, Mark Miner.</TE>

<HD>Campaign Underway to Recruit Foster Parents</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: Social workers hope to have 350 trained
families by 2005 to fill a need for safe homes for abused and
endangered children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 7-month-old Santa Paula girl had two broken legs and a family in
chaos. But when she was ready to leave the hospital this month,
social workers had to scramble to find a foster family that would
accept her.</LD>
<LD>   This kind of situation occurs all too frequently in Ventura
County, social workers say. The shortage of foster care has prompted
county officials to launch a three-year campaign to encourage
residents to open their homes to abused or endangered children in
need of temporary shelter.</LD>
<LD>   The county has 160 foster homes, down from 363 in 1991. About 40
children enter foster care each month, and about half as many leave
the system to be reunited with their parents, live with relatives or
be adopted.</LD>
<TE>   County Department of Children and Family Services statistics show
that Oxnard needs 52 more foster homes; Ventura, 29; Santa Paula and
Fillmore combined, 14; Port Hueneme, 14; Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park
and Westlake combined, 10; and Moorpark, 10.</TE>
<TE>   "People aren't aware of the need and sometimes they're scared away
by what they believe these children are like," said Ventura County
Juvenile Court Judge Charles Campbell, a key supporter of the
recruitment effort. "They're just kids like everyone else. We're
trying to get the word out to people that they should be responsible
for the children in their community."</TE>
<TE>   Because there aren't enough foster homes in many county cities to
meet the demand, children are often placed in homes far from their
parents and schools. This makes education, visitation and family
reunification all the more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   If a foster home cannot be found, the children are sent to Casa
Pacifica emergency shelter in Camarillo or one of two temporary homes
contracting with the county that will keep a child for up to 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   But the county wants to place children into a nearby foster home
as quickly as possible, one that can keep them as long as needed.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to have choices and options so we can best match
children to homes," said Trish Cavanaugh, foster care administrator
for Children and Family Services. "What happens now is [that] a child
may come in and we have one bed available for that age and sex, and
it may not be the best place for them."</TE>
<TE>   The local foster care shortage parallels a sharp decline
nationally, caused largely by economics, Cavanaugh said. With many
more two-earner families, parents have fewer hours to spend with
their own children, much less someone else's, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, county social workers and their supporters believe
they can make a dent in the problem by appealing to people who never
before thought about being foster parents or who considered it but
hesitated.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope to have a roster of 350 licensed foster families by
2005 after county workers and volunteers visit churches, professional
organizations, parent-teacher associations and civic groups to seek
recruits.</TE>
<TE>   The shortage is most acute among Latinos, who comprise 52% of
children in foster care but only 8% of foster families, Cavanaugh
said.</TE>
<TE>   The county places many Latino children in homes that may not
reflect their cultural needs, Cavanaugh said. If the children speak
only Spanish and their foster families don't, a difficult situation
is worsened, she said.</TE>
<TE>   To combat that, the department recently hired a bilingual
recruiter and a bilingual foster-care ombudsman to encourage and help
Latino families "take care of their own," Cavanaugh said. The county
also plans to place Spanish-language radio ads, and use other
marketing and public relations tools.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran foster parents will serve as mentors to new foster
families, helping them adjust to their roles.</TE>
<TE>   "Just knowing that you've helped out a child when they really
needed it is a wonderful thing," said Simi Valley resident Mariana
Abarta, a foster parent for 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband, Steve, parents of three adult children and a
teenager, are caring for their 38th and 39th foster child.</TE>
<TE>   Because Abarta is a registered pediatric nurse, the couple chose
to foster medically fragile infants who had been abused or were born
to drug-addicted mothers.</TE>
<TE>   "Drug babies almost always have long-term effects, because you
just don't know what to expect from the drugs--when the mother took
the drugs, how often or how much," Abarta said. "I'm a good, safe
place for them."</TE>
<TE>   To become a licensed foster parent, applicants must attend an
orientation, complete 12 hours of training and have their homes
inspected by a social worker.</TE>
<TE>   Families receive $425 to $600 a month per child to cover
necessities, such as food and clothing, and $50 to $250 more for
special needs, such as transportation to medical appointments.</TE>

<HD>Dynamo Powers Voters Group</HD>
<DH>Bakersfield: Even as state presence shrinks, a local league
chapter becomes more active.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VERONIQUE de TURENNE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>To say it's blazing hot here on a sunny Saturday is to mince words.</LD>
<LD>   Visitors to the cluster of antique stores in the drowsy downtown
clutch cold drinks and drift, squinty-eyed, through the streets. Over
on Chester Avenue, where dozens of bail bondsmen ply their trade,
aging cars idle with windows wide open to catch any breeze. For
paying guests at the swanky Holiday Inn next to the city's convention
center, it's all about the deep end of the pool.</LD>
<LD>   But Lois Chaney didn't seem to feel the heat. It was 96 degrees in
the shade on the grounds of the Kern County Museum, and Chaney,
president of the Bakersfield chapter of the League of Women Voters,
looked as if she had been sipping iced tea on the veranda, rather
than winding up a long afternoon's work.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of teachers, students and parents who had spent the
afternoon at the museum walked wearily to their cars. Chaney, a
red-white-and-blue sequined visor holding back her short auburn hair,
called greetings and reminders. It had been a small event--she had
staffed a league booth at someone else's function--but to Chaney, it
all matters. A lot.</TE>
<TE>   "We registered about 12 new voters--not too bad," Chaney said.
"What we really did today was show that the League of Women Voters
has a presence here in town."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Bakersfield chapter of the League of Women Voters has
a presence throughout the state. While participation in other
California chapters of the venerable organization has remained flat
or dropped, the Bakersfield league has tripled its membership. Its
ranks have swelled from 60 members in 1996 to 185. In addition, the
group has placed Measure K, a Kern County campaign finance reform
proposal, on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Chaney said the increase in membership is the result of growing
concern among the county's 661,000 residents over what they consider
to be unchecked development. But local and state leaders in the
league said activism in Bakersfield can be directly traced to Chaney.</TE>
<TE>   "She's dynamic and she's dedicated--a lot of that chapter's growth
comes from her efforts," said Barbara Inatsugu, president of the
state League of Women Voters. "The Bakersfield chapter has taken some
very big steps in the last few years, and to actually put out a
ballot measure is quite significant."</TE>
<TE>   The League of Women Voters, founded in 1920 as an outgrowth of the
women's suffrage movement, was designed to help female voters carry
out their new responsibilities. The nonpartisan group's mission is
twofold--to educate voters, and to support public policy issues and
debate. The California league has 11,219 members, down slightly from
previous years.</TE>
<TE>   "Leagues around the state seem to go for either voter education or
advocacy," Inatsugu said. "We're learning that leagues who have been
involved in issues that catch their community's attention and engage
the community in action are the ones that seem to be growing."</TE>
<TE>   In Kern County, where cheap land and sparse regulations combine to
give developers great freedom, the league's objective became
controlled growth. Chaney focused attention on the thousands of acres
of Kern County farmland being lost each year to housing and commerce.
Residents rallied, and soon public debates and forums on the topic
drew interest throughout the community.</TE>
<TE>   "Developers have had it all their own way here for a long time,"
Chaney said. A lifelong resident of the region, she has watched the
Central Valley grow from a rural farming community to a budding urban
center, complete with traffic, air pollution and crime.</TE>
<TE>   "But now, with the cheap housing drawing new people to the area,
we're getting residents who think differently," Chaney said. "Many of
them don't want so much uncontrolled growth."</TE>
<TE>   Once the alarm was raised, Chaney's next step was to help forge
policy that could put control of growth into the hands of local
lawmakers. To ensure that no single contributor could influence a
candidate, she targeted campaign finance reform.</TE>
<TE>   "We had one supervisor who collected $600,000 for his campaign,
and then spent $20,000 more than that, all for an $80,000-a-year
job," said one Bakersfield resident, Lois Watson, a retired
schoolteacher who is likely to take the reins when Chaney's term ends
in April.</TE>
<TE>   The Bakersfield League of Women Voters spent months researching
various campaign finance reform measures throughout the state. It
used a similar ballot measure in Orange County to craft Measure K,
which will appear on the November ballot. Measure K would limit how
much campaign money Kern County supervisors could accept and from
whom it could come.</TE>
<TE>   Not all new members were drawn to the league on the slow-growth
platform.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Garcia, the first Latino male member of the Bakersfield
league and a candidate for the local school board, said he wants to
make sure a diverse range of residents gets a voice in the county's
political debate.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said he admired Chaney's devotion to the cause of public
debate. "Lois is the League of Women Voters here in town. She's
making it a group that's representative of the area. That's
important."</TE>

<HD>Pension Funds Not Immune to Bear Market</HD>
<DH>Finances: Government employees' retirement plans have
suffered in extended decline, but they have a guaranteed backup: the
taxpayers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gathered over financial statements and chocolate-covered strawberries
at a Dana Point resort, trustees of Orange County's employee
retirement system heard the bad news. Like many ordinary Americans'
401(k) plans, the county pension fund is losing money for the third
straight year, thanks to debilitating stock market declines.</LD>
<LD>   The fund, which has fallen to about $4.3 billion from $4.8 billion
in December 2000, will also be making larger payouts as baby boomers
who have worked for the county and other local government agencies
for decades retire in record numbers.</LD>
<LD>   Declining earnings from a weak stock market are only part of the
problem. The nine members of the board--largely unpaid and several of
whom have little professional financial training--must also grapple
with increasingly generous and complex retirement packages offered to
public employees, which this year will total $23 million.</LD>
<TE>   But unlike private investors, the fund--like all public pension
funds--and its retirees have a guaranteed backup plan: taxpayers
--this year to the tune of $40 million. In other words, when
investments lose value, governments must pay the difference. Orange
County officials said they will have to make cuts to cover their
share of the payment.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the high stakes, most members are taking the long view and
believe they will be able to ride out the financial storm. "I'm not
worried," said longtime board member Thomas Fox, a county sheriff's
sergeant. "I'm not even going to call it losses ....What we're seeing
is corrections in the market. That's a natural process, and no, it
doesn't concern me."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there was little sense of panic at the annual two-day
board retreat at the Laguna Cliffs Marriott Resort in Dana Point,
which cost an estimated $8,000, complete with dinners at the Harbor
Grill restaurant nearby. The board and its staff also chalked up
$230,000 in expenses traveling to Europe, the Wharton School of
Business in Philadelphia and elsewhere in 2001 as well as hiring an
outside management consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Board executives and trustees say the job has few perks, that the
trips and training are grueling, and that sitting on the board is a
huge responsibility with little financial reward.</TE>
<TE>   The board is a mix of elected police, fire and other public
employee representatives sitting alongside members appointed by the
county Board of Supervisors. The appointees include retired
investment consultants, an anti-tax lobbyist, an estate and wills
attorney, and the Orange County and Tustin treasurers. Appointed
members are paid $100 per meeting; elected members earn nothing.</TE>
<TE>   While most hold down full-time jobs, they must also carry the
enormous responsibility of handling a $4-billion-plus fund designed
to provide income for 8,200 current and 22,000 future retirees.</TE>
<TE>   "I absolutely do not know why I ever consented to do this, because
it is so much work, so much unpaid work," said Sharon Neebe, an
accountant in the county treasurer's office who was elected to
represent county employees. "It is a horrendous amount of
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Keith Bozarth added: "Frankly I don't understand
why anybody would want to be a trustee."</TE>
<TE>   Bozarth, a longtime professional pension fund manager hired by the
Orange County fund about a year ago, agreed that despite recent
losses, the fund is in good shape.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good news story," said Bozarth, who points out that
while formerly highflying private 401(k)s have collapsed in value,
pension funds are chugging along steadily. Even a historic third
straight year of declines in stock market earnings doesn't perturb
him.</TE>
<TE>   Bozarth said the Orange County retirement system, one of 20 of its
kind in the state, has invested more conservatively than many. As a
result, he said, it has a far lower rate of losses.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the California Public Employees Retirement System,
the nation's largest public pension fund, suffered a nearly 6%
decline in value last year--almost twice what the Orange County fund
lost--because of investments in Enron and other stocks that have
nose-dived.</TE>
<TE>   Past board members and chief administrators have come under fire
for overspending on trips abroad and other perks, but Bozarth says
the excesses of the past have been eliminated. But he said
"especially in a down year" financially, it is important for board
members, who are often laypeople, to keep traveling, networking and
educating themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Although Los Angeles County's retirement system operates under the
same state code, the County Employers Retirement Law of 1937, as the
Orange County fund, the organizations differ in composition and size,
said Bill Lynes of the Los Angeles County chief administrative
office.</TE>
<TE>   A single nine-member board administers the Orange County fund,
while Los Angeles County's is run by two nine-member boards. One
administers the program and the other makes investment decisions.</TE>
<TE>   On each of the Los Angeles County boards, four members are elected
by employees and retirees, and four are appointed by the county board
of supervisors, with the county treasurer serving as the ninth
member.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County pension fund is several times the size of
Orange County's. As of June 30, the Los Angeles county system's
investments were valued at $25.9 billion, Lynes said. That figure is
down from $31.6 billion in June 2000.</TE>

<HD>Bill Boosting Stem-Cell Research to Be Signed</HD>
<DH>Science: Davis will OK measure that paves the way for
government funding of the controversial work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGG JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In a symbolic challenge to Bush administration efforts to restrict
stem-cell research, Gov. Gray Davis today will sign legislation aimed
at positioning California at the forefront of the controversial and
potentially revolutionary biomedical field, state officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Bill 253, by Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento), creates a
review process for stem-cell research and paves the way for the state
government to shift some of its millions of dollars in biomedical
research funds to the emerging stem-cell field, government and
private health experts said.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists and representatives of California's multibillion-dollar
biomedical industry say the measure is a badly needed boost for
stem-cell research, which has sparked a divisive political and
ethical debate nationwide.</LD>
<TE>   "Stem-cell research is responsible research that could potentially
save millions of lives," Davis said in a written statement. "I am
determined to keep California at the forefront of medical research
and scientific innovation."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists, patient advocacy groups and other supporters say
stem-cell research could result in revolutionary treatments for
spinal cord injuries and other diseases like cancer and Parkinson's
disease. Described by scientists as one of nature's most powerful
tools, stem cells found in human embryos, umbilical cords and
placentas have the ability to divide and become any kind of cell in
the body.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, led by the Catholic Church and antiabortion groups,
contend that research--which begins with the destruction of a human
embryo--is tantamount to murder.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush placed broad restrictions on federal funding for
stem-cell research last year. Congress is deeply divided over the
issue, with conservative Republicans seeking to make it a criminal
offense to conduct the research or even make use of any resulting
medical therapies.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists and industry groups praised the Ortiz bill as
groundbreaking. "Sen. Ortiz wants to send a message that we want to
maintain leadership in biomedical research in California, and this
does that," said David Gollaher, president and CEO of California
Healthcare Institute, which represents bioscientists and the
biomedical industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Since it's very unlikely that Congress will be able to agree on
[stem-cell and cloning] legislation, California has really taken
steps in advance of what the federal government is able to do."</TE>
<TE>   California is already a leader in stem-cell research. The bill
Davis will sign welcomes and encourages such research. However,
scientists say the scope of such research will still be hampered by
the federal government's uncertainty over the issue and the Bush
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' decision to sign the Ortiz bill could inject the
controversy into the California gubernatorial campaign, forcing
Republican challenger Bill Simon Jr. to choose between supporting his
conservative base on the issue or siding with the state's
economically vital biomedical and pharmaceutical industries.</TE>
<TE>   The federal restrictions and uncertainty surrounding stem-cell
research in the United States have scared off private investments and
spurred some leading scientists to pursue their research in Britain,
Israel and other countries forging ahead in the field.</TE>
<TE>   SB 253 is aimed at halting any brain-drain from California, said
Ortiz. The Sacramento Democrat said she was inspired to introduce her
bill by the mounting human and financial costs of killer diseases
that could be conquered through stem-cell research. "I had been
looking at stem-cell research when the Bush administration proposed
limiting research on a federal level by an executive order," she said
in a telephone interview. "I was struck by the lack of a scientific
basis for that decision."</TE>
<TE>   Her bill is aimed at putting in place a regulatory framework to
encourage stem-cell research and the associated cloning to produce
new cells, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the next frontier of saving lives and improving the
quality of lives, not just for persons with these diseases and
injuries, but also for their families dealing with these diseases and
injuries," said Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   Noting the strong opposition from the Catholic Church and other
opponents who equate the research with abortion, Ortiz applauded
Davis for signing the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The potential stakes are enormous, scientists say. "At this time,
there are a host of diseases that don't have any promise of cure in
our lifetime or even our children's lifetime, without exploring
embryonic stem cells," said Gollaher. "This is noncontroversial in
the world of science."</TE>
<TE>   Paralyzed actor Christopher Reeve--a leading advocate of stem-cell
research--is scheduled to join Davis today in a conference call
following the bill signing, administration officials said.</TE>

<HD>Fewer Teens in Crashes, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tough restrictions on new teenage drivers imposed four years ago have
reduced the number of teens involved in alcohol-related crashes in
California, according to a study by the Automobile Club of Southern
California.</LD>
<LD>   The study on the impact of the 1998 graduated driver licensing
program found that alcohol-related accidents involving 16-year-old
drivers dropped 16% in the first year after it was adopted and 13% in
the second year.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, alcohol-related accidents increased for drivers
who received licenses before the licensing program took effect, the
study found.</LD>
<TE>   "This new study is the first analysis for California or the U.S.
to confirm that graduated driver licensing has a positive impact on
drinking-and-driving crashes," said Steven Bloch, a senior Auto Club
researcher.</TE>
<TE>   At least 33 states throughout the nation have adopted graduated
licensing laws similar to California's.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, new drivers under age 18 must hold their learner's
permit for at least six months before getting a provisional license.
During that time, they must spend at least 50 hours behind the wheel
practicing with a parent or guardian.</TE>
<TE>   Once they earn a provisional license, teenagers are prohibited
from carrying passengers younger than 20 for the first six months
unless a licensed driver 25 or older is in the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The law, endorsed by the Auto Club and Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, was adopted in response to high death and injury rates among
young drivers.</TE>
<TE>   In California, drivers 15 to 19 represent about 4% of the driving
population but are involved in 9% of all fatal accidents and 10% of
all injury accidents, according to the California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Previous Auto Club studies have shown that the licensing law has
helped reduce all types of accidents involving teenage drivers. This
latest study shows specifically that the law has helped reduce
alcohol-related accidents.</TE>
<TE>   "We are delighted with the results," said Tina Pasco, executive
director of the Los Angeles County chapter of MADD.</TE>
<TE>   According to the study, 16-year-old drivers were involved in 271
alcohol-related crashes in 1997, the year before the law took effect.
That translates to five crashes per 100,000 drivers. That number
dropped to 236 accidents in 1999 and 246 in 2000, or 4.2 crashes per
100,000 drivers.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the number of alcohol-related accidents for new
drivers who were licensed before the program took effect has risen
each year. It went from 1,118 accidents in 1997 to 1,321 crashes, or
23 per 100,000 drivers, in 1998. That is a 6% increase.</TE>
<TE>   That number increased again to 1,421 last year--an 11% rise.</TE>

<HD>Violent Fact and Fiction Merge at Rancho Guajome</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If ever a house was populated by fictitious characters as well as the
real personalities that may have inspired them, it's San Diego
County's Rancho Guajome.</LD>
<LD>   The rancho, steeped in historic lawlessness, owes its name to the
Luiseno Indian word whakavumi, meaning "the frog pond," and much of
its reputation to the ruthless soldier who built it. The rest of its
reputation comes from the writer who made it famous.</LD>
<LD>   Cave Johnson Couts was a pioneer who fought off cattle rustlers,
squatters and all other comers with gun, guile and muscle. He also
had a taste for drink that proved fatal to foes--and, eventually,
himself.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Tennessee and educated at West Point, he came to
California as an Army lieutenant in 1848, a year before the gold
strike, to help wrest the state away from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   He made a fortune feeding gold miners with his cattle. He also
kept diaries that became one of the most important published
historical sources of information about California during the Gold
Rush. These days, the volumes are in the custody of the Huntington
Library.</TE>
<TE>   Three decades after Couts' adventures made him and his home
famous, Helen Hunt Jackson came calling. After a dust-up over Indian
servants, Couts' widow sent her packing. Once she'd read Jackson's
1884 best-selling novel "Ramona"--the "Gone With the Wind" of its
day--she threatened to sue.</TE>
<TE>   Couts stood 6 feet 3 and weighed more than 200 pounds. He survived
gunfights, Indian battles and a lackluster stint in the military
before settling in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   In 1849, he was part of an escort for Army wagons from Monterrey,
Mexico, to California. As the Army rode through San Diego, two
daughters of prominent ranchero Juan Bandini leaned on a porch
railing--as the story goes--to watch the troops. The railing gave way
and the girls fell. Couts had the presence of mind to spur his horse
over to one of them, Ysidora Bandini, and help her to her feet. Two
years later, they were married.</TE>
<TE>   Later in 1849, as California was preparing to become a state,
Couts was appointed to the statehood convention. He also surveyed and
mapped the town of San Diego, where he paid tribute to his future
father-in-law with some place names, such as Juan Street.</TE>
<TE>   In 1851, Ysidora's sister, Arcadia Bandini Stearns, and Arcadia's
husband, prosperous rancher Abel Stearns, gave the couple the deed to
the 2,219-acre Rancho Guajome as a wedding gift.</TE>
<TE>   Today, its remaining 165 acres are part of Guajome Regional Park,
about three miles east of Mission San Luis Rey in the wilds of
Oceanside. Rangers can discuss the history of the state, the family
and the rancho's supposed links to the fictional half-Indian maiden
Ramona (to which many Southern California sites lay claim).</TE>
<TE>   Couts used the gift as a beginning to become a land baron. He
resigned from the Army and soon acquired other San Diego properties,
including the area surrounding Mission San Luis Rey (but not the
mission itself) and, later, nearby Buena Vista Rancho.</TE>
<TE>   But an Indian war loomed. Less than a year after his resignation,
the Army recalled him and promoted him to lieutenant colonel. Leading
a group of soldiers and volunteers, Couts quashed the rebellion and
captured Antonio Garra, a bitter Luiseno who had sworn vengeance
against all white settlers.</TE>
<TE>   Couts served as prosecutor and judge at the trial of Garra, who
was convicted and executed by firing squad.</TE>
<TE>   Some Indians resented Couts, but more than 300 Luisenos who lived
in the shadow of Mission San Luis Rey helped him build the 22-room
Rancho Guajome in exchange for permission to live and hunt on his
land. The rancho was almost a town; it even had its own general store
and jail.</TE>
<TE>   In 1853, Couts moved into Rancho Guajome with his wife and two
children. (The couple eventually had 10, eight of whom survived.) He
was appointed U.S. Indian sub-agent, with duties that included
responsibility for the welfare of local tribes.</TE>
<TE>   That's about when his relationship with the Indians went from
tentative to terrible.</TE>
<TE>   Twice, a county grand jury considered charging him for beating two
Indians with a strip of rawhide. One man eventually died from the
beating, but no charges were filed.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1860s, floods and a long drought had led to a
breakdown of the cattle industry, which almost ruined Couts.</TE>
<TE>   Far grimmer and more ruthless was the smallpox epidemic of
1862-63. Couts kept tabs on it in his diary:</TE>
<TE>   "Smallpox is quite prevalent--six to eight per day are being
buried in S. Juan Capistrano--Indians generally.... I vaccinated the
whole rancheria at San Luis some six weeks since, and hope they may
escape, thus saving our community of the terrible disease."</TE>
<TE>   Fearful that the malady would spread, Couts determined to prevent
burials of its victims in the mission cemetery, which he owned. His
edict would lead to bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 13, 1863, family and friends of a well-known vaquero and
cattleman, Don Ysidro Maria Alvarado, arrived at the cemetery for his
burial. Couts' younger brother, San Diego Deputy Sheriff William
Blount Couts, rode up with two of his brother's vaqueros to prevent
it.</TE>
<TE>   As the Alvarado family lowered the coffin into the grave, Blount
Couts told them that they could not proceed.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting at Burial</TE>
<TE>   One member of the burial party, Leon Vasquez, was outraged. Shovel
in hand, he rushed at Blount Couts, who was armed with a
double-barreled shotgun. Blount Couts shot him to death.</TE>
<TE>   As the unarmed burial party fled in fear, one of Couts' vaqueros
fired again, wounding two men.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole affair was the act of a moment, the shots and
deaths--all was muy pronto," one of Alvarado's sons, Tomas, later
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Cave Johnson Couts felt responsible for what had happened and
tried to deflect some of the blame. He wrote his brother's defense
attorney: "The fellow killed is really not worth noticing. He
[Vasquez] is known as a bad character."</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, San Diego County indicted Blount Couts for
murder. His attorney cited a variety of problems with the paperwork
and succeeded in having the charge dropped, despite depositions from
eight witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Smallpox had subsided by the spring of 1863, but Couts' bad luck
continued.</TE>
<TE>   In 1865, while visiting the San Diego city plaza, he happened upon
Juan Mendoza, his former ranch foreman, whom he had fired. Mendoza
had threatened to kill Couts on several occasions. But when Mendoza
spotted his former employer, he turned around and walked in the
opposite direction. Couts showed no such compunction: He flew into a
rage and shot Mendoza in the back with a double-barreled shotgun,
killing him.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Judge Benjamin Hayes, a friend of Couts,
defended him, contending that the victim was a known robber and
troublemaker and that his client had merely acted in self-defense.
Couts was cleared on grounds that one of the jurors was not an
American citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Fatherhood wasn't as forgiving as the law. In 1868, Couts'
15-year-old daughter, Tonia, ran off with two of his vaqueros. He
tracked down the threesome and enrolled her in an Oakland convent.</TE>
<TE>   By 1870, he believed she had reformed and allowed her to return
home. Couts was to be rudely disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   He caught Waldemar Muller, a schoolteacher he had hired to tutor
his children, climbing out of his daughter's window in the middle of
the night. Muller tried to run, but Couts, drunken and enraged,
peppered him with a load of buckshot. Muller was critically wounded;
Couts was arrested and severely beaten by the sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   Even Couts' attorney scolded him in a note: "I fear your
excitability from drink--as a friend, let me ask you to keep sober.
It is the only way to get even with the miserable judge and Irish
sheriff." The case was dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   But the lawyer's warning about alcohol was on target. Couts died
four years later at age 53, his health compromised by years of heavy
drinking.</TE>
<TE>   Ysidora, known throughout the county for her hospitality,
continued to run the rancho with the help of her eldest son, Cave Jr.</TE>
<TE>   In 1882, while Helen Hunt Jackson was touring Southern California
missions and Indian reservations, she visited Rancho Guajome. She
returned a few months later, staying for several days and locking
horns with Ysidora.</TE>
<TE>   As the two women prepared to hear Mass in the chapel, Indian
servants brought them chairs from the house. Jackson objected to the
servants' sitting on the floor. Ysidora worried that she would incite
a riot among the servants and asked her to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "Ysidora was very demanding on her servants, and the two women had
unmendable differences about race and class," says Rancho Guajome
senior park ranger Jake Enriquez.</TE>
<TE>   In 1884, when "Ramona" was published, Ysidora was outraged at what
she perceived to be an unflattering portrayal of her and her son. She
began talking to lawyers, but Jackson died before a lawsuit was
filed.</TE>
<TE>   Reality vs. Fiction</TE>
<TE>   Ysidora does resemble the fictional Senora Moreno, Ramona's
Spanish guardian and rancho matriarch, Enriquez tells visitors, just
as bits of Ramona's home resemble Guajome. Ysidora died in 1897,
leaving the rancho in the hands of Cave Jr., who continued his
father's wanton ways.</TE>
<TE>   The land remained in the family for 122 years, until 1973, when
San Diego County purchased it for more than $1 million. Cave Jr.'s
three elderly grandchildren--whose grandmother was Cave Jr.'s servant
but never his wife--got the money.</TE>

<HD>Mariners Put Cork in Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Washburn will get his chance to clinch playoff
berth today after two mistakes lead to 6-4 loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Every few minutes, Jarrod Washburn would look up. As the Angels
played outside, and as Washburn sat inside the Angel clubhouse
charting pitches, the clubhouse attendants scrambled around the room,
large plastic sheets in their hands. The guys rolled up the sheets
and pinned them above each locker.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a little tease," Washburn said.</LD>
<LD>   If the Angels had rallied to take the lead in the ninth inning,
the guys would have hustled to unroll the plastic sheets. If the
Angels had won, champagne would be flying around the room, and the
plastic would protect the clothes, shoes and gloves inside the
lockers as the Angels celebrated their first playoff berth in 16
years.</LD>
<TE>   Well, maybe today. The clubhouse was dry after Saturday's 6-4 loss
to the Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The loss pushed the Angels closer to a first-round playoff matchup
against the New York Yankees. The Angels fell two games behind
Oakland in the American League West--effectively, three games,
because the A's won the tiebreaker--with seven to play.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of the AL West gets home-field advantage and gets to
face the Minnesota Twins. The loser gets the wild card and the New
York Yankees, amid the mystique of Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   And today, the Angels get to pitch their ace, in the game that
could guarantee them a red October.</TE>
<TE>   "I like being that guy," Washburn said. "I would have rather we
got it done today and stay one game back of Oakland. That said, it's
going to be fun."</TE>
<TE>   Those plastic sheets came oh-so-close to coming down Saturday, as
the Angels got the tying runs on base in the eighth inning and loaded
the bases with two out in the ninth. Seattle closer Kazuhiro Sasaki
ended the game by retiring Garret Anderson on a fly ball.</TE>
<TE>   But, by the time Sasaki entered the game, the Angels had made the
two blunders that lost them the game.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth inning, with Seattle up, 2-1, and the bases loaded
with two out, John Olerud grounded to third baseman Troy Glaus.
Rather than throw to first base, Glaus opted for the force at second,
even with second baseman Adam Kennedy shading Olerud toward first
base.</TE>
<TE>   "He would have had a play at first," first baseman Scott Spiezio
said. "I think he had a play at either base."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   By trying for the play at second, Glaus had to try to hit a moving
target in Kennedy. He missed, the throw sailed into right field, and
the bases cleared. Bret Boone then doubled home Olerud, giving the
Mariners four unearned runs and a 6-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels closed within 6-4 in the seventh inning, with home runs
from Darin Erstad and Bengie Molina. With two on and two out in the
eighth, the Angels used their preferred pinch-hitter, Orlando
Palmeiro.</TE>
<TE>   But Spiezio, running from second base, took off for third, and
pitcher Jeff Nelson calmly stepped off the rubber to avoid a balk,
then started a rundown in which Spiezio was tagged for the third out,
depriving Palmeiro of his chance.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't an entirely lost afternoon for the Angels. They were
pleased with the performance of starter John Lackey, the victim of
Glaus' error. Lackey took a shutout into the fifth inning before
giving up six runs--two earned. He remains scheduled to start the
fourth game of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   And the Angels were thrilled with the performance of Francisco
Rodriguez, whom they wanted to evaluate in a tense situation as they
decide whether to include the kid on their playoff roster. In his
third major league appearance, with one out and runners on second and
third, he struck out Dan Wilson and Jeff Cirillo. Rodriguez, 20, has
struck out seven consecutive batters.</TE>

<LD>Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post, on golfer Suzy Whaley, who
qualified for next year's Greater Hartford Open:</LD>
<LD>   "There are two PGA tours now--the one Tiger is on, and the other
one. And the other one is withering. Corporate sponsorship is drying
up. Tournaments without Tiger are actually endangered species. There
is a very technical scientific term for what a woman playing in a PGA
tournament would do. The term is: cha-ching!</LD>
<LD>   "Ultimately, this is about entertainment. Ben Brundred, the
chairman of the Kemper Open, understood this 10 years ago when he
invited Mark Rypien to play. Rypien shot something like 170 and
didn't make the cut. But he had one of the biggest galleries on the
course, and they cheered his every shot. This is Mark Rypien times
1,000.</LD>
<TE>   "More paying customers than have ever paid before will flock to
the GHO if Suzy Whaley plays. More television viewers than have ever
viewed the GHO before will tune in their TV sets if Suzy Whaley
plays. [Memo to Ben Brundred: Book her now for next year's Kemper.]
And every one of them will root for her. She could shoot 100 and they
would clap for her like she was Jack Nicklaus in his prime."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is UCLA's only Heisman Trophy winner?</TE>
<TE>   He wants it both ways: Mac O'Grady in Southern California Golf
magazine, on why he wanted to play in the B.C. Open in July as both a
right-handed and left-handed golfer: "It would have been great
publicity for the tournament. I would have had two bags and two
caddies. I would even make sure I shot the same scores so I could
play in the same group on the weekend."</TE>
<TE>   Ho hum: Art Spander of the Oakland Tribune writing on the lack of
interest in California's football team even after the Bears won their
first three games: "Cal football is on the map once more, even if you
need a magnifying glass to find it, the alumni aren't particularly
intrigued, and the rest of the Bay Area doesn't seem to care."</TE>
<TE>   Cal's 23-21 loss to Air Force on Saturday won't help.</TE>
<TE>   A real gamer: Somebody asked Arizona Cardinal receiver Frank
Sanders if he could recall the last time his team rushed for 249
yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I did it on PlayStation two weeks ago," Sanders said. "Then
again, I'm very good at PlayStation."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1969, San Francisco's Willie Mays
became only the second major league player to hit 600 home runs with
a two-run shot off Mike Corkins, giving the Giants a 4-2 victory over
the San Diego Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1987, the 1,585-member NFL
Players Assn. went on strike after the Monday night game between New
England and the New York Jets.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Quarterback Gary Beban in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bob Wojnowski of the Detroit News said the Lions
aren't doing rookie Joey Harrington any favors by promoting him to
starting quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you feel bad for Mike McMahon, who did not get a fair shot,
and might not get another here," Wojnowski wrote. "But you should
harbor similar empathy for Harrington, who completes the transition
from Oregon Duck to sitting duck, as his head coach tries to avoid
becoming a lame duck."</TE>

<HD>Nomo Befits Retiring Type for Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He sets down 18 straight batters, Grissom hits
winning single in ninth to beat Padres, 5-3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The Dodger season seemed to be teetering on the brink.</LD>
<LD>   They hadn't even played two full innings of their 5-3 victory over
the San Diego Padres on Saturday and disaster was lurking from all
directions.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Giants had already won, meaning a Dodger defeat
would put them three games back in the wild-card race with seven
games to play.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers had lost their center fielder and leadoff man Dave
Roberts in the first inning, the ecstasy of his game-opening home run
turning to agony when it was learned he had strained a muscle on his
right side, ending his evening and perhaps his season. Roberts will
definitely miss today's game and he was pessimistic Saturday night
about returning for the final week.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Hideo Nomo, the Dodgers' last best hope on a torn and
battered pitching staff, had just given up a three-run second-inning
home run to Tom Lampkin.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, having gazed into the abyss, the Dodgers somehow pulled
themselves back from the edge and back into the postseason chase with
a stirring comeback in front of a disappointed crowd of 48,208.</TE>
<TE>   After that home run, Nomo retired 18 Padres in a row and won his
seventh straight decision improving to 16-6.</TE>
<TE>   Marquis Grissom, filling in for Roberts, drove in three runs,
including a two-run single in the ninth inning off Padre relief ace
Trevor Hoffman to break a 3-3 tie.</TE>
<TE>   "That was just fun," Grissom said. "There wasn't too much pressure
on myself. Just a fastball down and in. I had a good idea what
[Hoffman] was going to try to do. He did a good job. I just got the
bat out there on it."</TE>
<TE>   And Eric Gagne came on in the ninth to record his 50th save, the
first Dodger and only the eighth man ever to reach that milestone.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all the Dodger heroics, the victory was ultimately
clinched on a questionable move by the Padres' Cesar Crespo.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the ninth, Ryan Klesko had doubled for San Diego.
With two out, Sean Burroughs singled behind second base to put
runners at first and third. Padre Manager Bruce Bochy put Crespo in
as a pinch-runner at first and gave him the green light to run if he
saw an opening.</TE>
<TE>   With Gene Kingsale at the plate, Crespo took off and was gunned
down when catcher Paul Lo Duca threw a strike to second baseman Alex
Cora to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Hideo Nomo, I have run out of adjectives to describe what this
guy has meant to our ballclub," said Manager Jim Tracy. "It has been
well-chronicled how he was brought in here and what he was brought in
here for. To turn into the ace of your staff and pitch the way this
guy has pitched. It's just been phenomenal."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts had hit only two home runs this season in 127 games. And
he had previously hit only two homers in 75 games over a three-season
span in his career.</TE>
<TE>   This one came on a 2-2 pitch, the ball just making it over the
wall in right field 336 feet away and into the first row of seats.</TE>
<TE>   Given the luxury of a lead, Nomo didn't hold it for long. With one
out in the second, Kingsale hit a chopper to the mound that Nomo
bobbled, allowing the San Diego left fielder to beat Nomo's
subsequent throw to first. After Brian Buchanan singled to right,
Lampkin blasted Nomo's first pitch into the right-field seats for his
10th home run.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 25th home run allowed by Nomo, a club record.</TE>
<TE>   The next Padre to get aboard was Ron Gant with a one-out pinch hit
single in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Still for all the postgame euphoria, there was gloom over Roberts'
condition.</TE>
<TE>   "I even thought about getting out of that at-bat and having
someone pinch-hit for me," he said. "That's how bad it was. I'm kind
of down about it. It doesn't look good."</TE>

<DH>New Dodger sparkplug Roberts learns tricks of the leadoff
trade from one of the best in Wills</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL PLASCHKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is the middle of a game, but the old hustler has always known when
to make his move, and it is now.</LD>
<LD>   He walks through the stands, down a stairwell, through the Dodger
clubhouse, up a tunnel, toward their dugout.</LD>
<LD>   Just before he reaches the bench and bat rack and glare of the
cameras, he stops.</LD>
<TE>   Deep enough to hide. Close enough to whisper.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you get him for me?" he asks a batboy.</TE>
<TE>   The batboy knows who he means. Everybody knows why he is here.</TE>
<TE>   The old hustler is looking for the face he sees in the mirror each
morning, the voice he hears on his cell phone at night.</TE>
<TE>   The old hustler is looking for the new kid.</TE>
<TE>   There is a clatter of cleats, a parting of players, a dusty Dodger
uniform entering the shadows.</TE>
<TE>   "What's up?" says the new kid.</TE>
<TE>   "You can bunt on these guys," says the old hustler.</TE>
<TE>   "But I tried, and I can't."</TE>
<TE>   "Try it again, but try it this way ..."</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, the old hustler disappears into the darkness while
the new kid steps into the sunshine, a big fastball, a pretty bunt
attempt, a slide into first base, a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   After a baseball lifetime of searching for a home, new kid Dave
Roberts has finally found one.</TE>
<TE>   Come to think of it, so has old hustler Maury Wills.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   They meet a couple of times a week, on the Dodger Stadium field,
the first ones.</TE>
<TE>   While teammates are dressing or eating, Maury Wills and Dave
Roberts are working.</TE>
<TE>   "Stay in there!" Wills says.</TE>
<TE>   "Like this?" Roberts says.</TE>
<TE>   A batting practice pitcher is throwing fastballs. Roberts is
bunting them.</TE>
<TE>   Left, right, straight, third base, first base, again, again.</TE>
<TE>   The only spectators are birds that have settled curiously upon the
outfield grass. The only sounds are the plunk of a bat, the music of
a lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "Come out of the box on that," Wills says.</TE>
<TE>   "Like this?" Roberts says.</TE>
<TE>   It is a dance they have been doing for nine months now, alone, at
odd hours, the dance of the desperate.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts had spent most of the previous eight seasons in a minor
league uniform, from Akron to Visalia, from unhappy to unwanted.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Dodgers last winter from Cleveland in a trade that
cost the team only two non-prospects. He was looking only to belong.</TE>
<TE>   Maury Wills, arguably the most exciting player in Los Angeles
history, had spent much of the last 30 years bouncing around in the
same manner, looking for the same place.</TE>
<TE>   He tried drugs, alcohol, contemplated suicide, failed as a major
league manager, struggled as an instructor. Two years ago, he
rejoined the Dodgers for one last try.</TE>
<TE>   Says Roberts: "I wanted somebody who would give me a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Says Wills: "I wanted somebody who would listen."</TE>
<TE>   The dance started in January, at the winter workouts at Dodger
Stadium. Even though he was new to the team, Roberts was easy to
spot.</TE>
<TE>   On most days, he was the only major leaguer who showed up.</TE>
<TE>   Three times a week, he would make the two-hour drive from his home
in north San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Says Roberts: "I'm the kind of person who can't take anything for
granted."</TE>
<TE>   Says Wills: "When I saw he was the only major leaguer around, I
knew he wanted to do something."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts was 29, Wills was 69, but they were striking in their
similarities, even down to their stature and smiles.</TE>
<TE>   As Roberts had struggled in the minor leagues, so had Wills, for
nearly nine years before getting his chance.</TE>
<TE>   As Roberts had difficulty convincing people he could win games
with his legs, so did Wills, who didn't even bat leadoff until his
second year with the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody expected Roberts to be with the team on opening day.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody expected Wills to last parts of 14 seasons, lead the league
in steals six times, break Ty Cobb's 47-year-old record for stolen
bases in a season, revolutionize baseball's running game.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts had been stuck in Cleveland behind the quirky Kenny
Lofton.</TE>
<TE>   Wills had been stuck in Los Angeles trying to teach the quirky Tom
Goodwin.</TE>
<TE>   Says Roberts: "Getting a chance to work with Maury was like a
dream come true."</TE>
<TE>   Says Wills: "I finally had a protege."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the winter they worked, and then again in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Wills would hold a general bunting and baserunning session in the
morning, and Roberts would show up before everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   Wills would hold another session after the workouts, and Roberts
would stay until everyone left.</TE>
<TE>   Says Roberts: "No offense to anyone else, but Maury was teaching
my game, and I had to hear him."</TE>
<TE>   Says Wills: "It was so funny how everyone would leave, then Dave
would double back for more."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts slowly worked his way up the depth chart, passing McKay
Christensen, Marquis Grissom and, finally, Goodwin.</TE>
<TE>   By opening day, the Dodgers were so impressed that they were
willing to release Goodwin even though they owed him $3.75 million.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin never really listened to Wills. Roberts never listened to
anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "The way he responded to Maury, it was very gratifying," General
Manager Dan Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   "From that first winter workout, we knew we had something."</TE>
<TE>   The season started, and the Dodgers learned even more.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts was stealing bases and starting fires and behaving like
the Dodgers' best leadoff hitter since Brett Butler.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, he had picked up not only Wills' techniques, but his
brashness.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept telling him, 'There's no bunt you can't get down, there's
no hit you can't score from,' " Wills says.</TE>
<TE>   "And now I believe it," Roberts says.</TE>
<TE>   They not only work together at Dodger Stadium before the games,
and talk during the games, but they talk on the phone after the game.</TE>
<TE>   Even when Roberts is on the East Coast. And even when Wills is
calling late.</TE>
<TE>   Says Roberts: "My phone will ring in my room at 1:30 in the
morning. Maury can be a real worrywart."</TE>
<TE>   Says Wills: "He always wants to know if I watched him that night.
I better say yes."</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, even though he doesn't start against
left-handers, Roberts--who hit a home run in the first inning
Saturday night at San Diego before leaving the game with a strained
oblique muscle--has stolen 45 bases and has a chance to become the
first Dodger to lead the league in that category in 26 years.</TE>
<TE>   He was the last player in the major leagues to hit into a double
play, and that didn't happen until last week.</TE>
<TE>   He also has 17 bunt hits, ranking third in the National League
behind two everyday players.</TE>
<TE>   All of which led to Monday night, third inning, runner on first,
one out, Dodgers trailing the San Francisco Giants, 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   If they lose this game, their season could end a couple of nights
later.</TE>
<TE>   They need something drastic. They need something inspired.</TE>
<TE>   The old hustler and the new kid give them both.</TE>
<TE>   With a 1-and-0 count, Roberts suddenly squares on shaky Jason
Schmidt and pops a bunt toward second base.</TE>
<TE>   It is a silly place for a bunt. Except Roberts had studied the
Giants and knew that Jeff Kent would be covering first base and J.T.
Snow would be charging straight ahead.</TE>
<TE>   It was an awful place for a bunt. Except earlier that afternoon,
working with Wills, Roberts had practiced it continuously.</TE>
<TE>   It was a perfect place for a bunt. Snow grabbed it, but there was
nobody covering first base and Roberts was safe.</TE>
<TE>   Two batters later, Brian Jordan hit a grand slam that might have
saved a season.</TE>
<TE>   "You watched us practice that bunt, right?" Roberts asks a
reporter later that night, his voice rising in disbelief. "We knew it
would work, didn't we? Didn't we?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When it became obvious Dave Roberts was going to make the team
this spring, it became obvious he would have to change his number.</TE>
<TE>   He wore "50" as a projected spring training outcast. He wanted
something smaller.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had an idea.</TE>
<TE>   They summoned him into a room and told him that they had a perfect
number for him, a number that had been dormant for too long, a number
that would revive old memories while building a new bridge.</TE>
<TE>   They wanted him to wear No. 6.</TE>
<TE>   It took Roberts two seconds to say no.</TE>
<TE>   The former San Diego County high school star and UCLA graduate
wasn't going anywhere near the exalted memory of Steve Garvey.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up listening to my father tell stories about those
Dodgers," Roberts said. "Wearing that number just wouldn't feel
right."</TE>
<TE>   He asked for another number.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, the request nearly makes Maury Wills cry.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to wear my No. 30," Wills says. "Isn't that something?"</TE>
<TE>   Watching No. 30 single, steal second and score in the first inning
of this season's first game felt like closure to Wills.</TE>
<TE>   After struggling to earn the Dodgers' trust since being released
in 1972, it was family again.</TE>
<TE>   "The time has arrived that he has been waiting for," said Mikkie
Wills, Maury's daughter. "He's always telling me how his work with
Dave Roberts has fulfilled him as a person."</TE>
<TE>   The wait had been long and ugly. You've heard the stories. Wills,
who has been clean and sober since Aug. 13, 1989, recounts them today
as if they happened to someone else.</TE>
<TE>   But every time he realizes he lost his three World Series rings
and MVP plaque during drug-induced hazes, he knows it was him.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because voters were uncomfortable with his post-career
behavior, it will now take a Veterans' Committee push to induct him
into his rightful spot in the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because he had burned bridges here, his memorabilia is
housed in a place he never lived or played, in a museum in a ballpark
in Fargo, N.D., the only folks kind enough to make the offer.</TE>
<TE>   "God, how I've come back," Wills says. "But what a price I've
paid."</TE>
<TE>   He still remembers the months he spent locked in his Playa del Rey
home in the early 1980s, blankets on the windows, trash on the floor,
a Doberman named Charmer roaming the front yard.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers knew he was on drugs when, in 1983, a rumor spread
through the press box that he had died of an overdose.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Claire, then a vice president, became alarmed.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, this is obviously a man who needs our help, have we
really done enough for him?" Claire recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Claire summoned Don Newcombe, the club's community
relations director, and together they drove to Wills' house.</TE>
<TE>   "Don was worried about the dog and the boarded-up windows and all
that," Claire said. "But I said, 'I don't care, we're getting him
out.' "</TE>
<TE>   Once they arrived, Newcombe never made it past Charmer.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw that huge dog and I was seriously afraid," he recalled. "So
I went back to the car. We waited there until Maury saw us through
the window."</TE>
<TE>   Wills emerged from the house with wild hair and dirty clothes. But
when Claire and Newcombe grabbed him, he did not resist.</TE>
<TE>   They rushed him to an Orange County treatment center where he
registered under the name "Donald Claire."</TE>
<TE>   It would be six more years before Wills became completely clean.
After a dreadful 82-game stint as manager of the Seattle Mariners in
1980, it would be several years before baseball teams would take him
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, Wills blew thousands of dollars of help from
former Dodger owner Peter O'Malley, and alienated an organization
that tried to love him.</TE>
<TE>   "We always thought of Maury as a liar," Newcombe said. "But now we
trust him."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation for that trust was poured a couple of years ago,
when new chairman Bob Daly saw Wills walk onto the Dodger Stadium
field as a Montreal Expo instructor.</TE>
<TE>   As a longtime Dodger fan, Daly was appalled.</TE>
<TE>   "He came over to me and said, 'What are you doing in that
uniform?' " Wills recalls. "He said, 'You should be in a Dodger
uniform again.' "</TE>
<TE>   The next spring, Wills was hired and given surprisingly free rein
by Manager Jim Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   "His relationship with Dave Roberts is one of the most special
things I have seen in the clubhouse this year," Tracy said. "It is
like a father-son relationship. It has helped change our team."</TE>
<TE>   And their clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   In an era when most ballplayers adorn their lockers with gadgets
and freebies, Roberts' locker features an old-fashioned button.</TE>
<TE>   It is adorned with the face of a different era, a freebie of a
different time.</TE>
<TE>   It is a Maury Wills button.</TE>
<TE>   The new kid points to it with a grin. The old hustler looks at it
with a sigh.</TE>
<TE>   Says Roberts: "I could not have made it to this point without
him."</TE>
<TE>   Says Wills: "In many ways, neither could I."</TE>

<HD>Real Patriots</HD>
<DH>Super Bowl champions finally have turned skeptics into
believers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So you thought the New England Patriots were a farce? You thought
they'd be Super Bowl souffle by now? Boston baked beings?</LD>
<LD>   Well, you're not alone.</LD>
<LD>   "I certainly wasn't a believer," said Bill Walsh, who won three
Super Bowls as coach of the 49ers. "I didn't believe in [the
Patriots] until I saw them the last two weeks."</LD>
<TE>   While the football world rubs its eyes, the underdog Patriots have
been wiping out the competition, having beaten the Steelers and Jets
by a combined 74-21. New England's offense, which scored a touchdown
a game in the playoffs last season, has tripled that weekly output.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't score that many points without doing something right,"
said Larry Webster, a defensive tackle for the Jets. "They're the
world champions, and they're showing why."</TE>
<TE>   If only the sports world had realized that a few months ago, maybe
Lawyer Milloy wouldn't be so steamed. Milloy, a Pro Bowl safety, was
one of several Patriots who made the six-hour flight from Boston to
Los Angeles in the off-season for the ESPY awards. The Super Bowl
champions were nominees in three categories: team, coach and breakout
player of the year. Quarterback Tom Brady won the latter, but the
team and coach awards went to the Lakers and their coach, Phil
Jackson. Making matters worse, Jackson wasn't in attendance, so ESPN
didn't even announce that award, leaving Patriot Coach Bill Belichick
wondering why he had even bothered to come.</TE>
<TE>   On the edge of his seat at the Kodak Theater, wearing his
custom-made tuxedo, Milloy was fit to be bow tied.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very disappointing. I think we're the closest team to
ESPN," he said, referring to the network's headquarters in Bristol,
Conn., a two-hour drive from Boston. "I was thinking we might get
some special treatment.... But I'm never going to the ESPYs again. I
wouldn't go. It was a joke.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wanted us to be a fluke. We don't have a fluke coach
here. Any time Bill Belichick coaches a team, you can't count it
out."</TE>
<TE>   This week, the betting line finally reflects that. The Patriots
are favored, by nine at home against Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Brady, the 199th pick in the 2000 draft, is becoming
one of the league's better quarterbacks. He was rewarded recently
with a four-year, $28-million contract extension that included a
$10-million signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Belichick uses symbolic gestures to hammer home his coaching
message. Early last season, when Miami rolled to a 30-10 victory over
the Patriots, Belichick staged a mock funeral for the game ball,
burying it in the practice field. At a minicamp over the off-season,
he handed out T-shirts featuring the 2002 AFC East standings, with
every team at 0-0. He had Celtic legend Bill Russell talk to his
players about the importance of teamwork. And, at training camp,
Patriot players wore T-shirts that read, "Targeting September," with
their first four opponents--the Steelers, Jets, Chiefs and
Chargers--all within a bull's-eye.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots are trying to become only the seventh franchise in
NFL history to repeat as Super Bowl champions. Only one of those
teams, the Denver Broncos in 1997 and '98, has pulled off the feat
since free agency began in 1993 and keeping a roster intact became
such a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   New England not only kept its roster intact, retaining 20 of 22
starters from last season, but bulked up in the off-season with the
addition of three better-than-average tight ends: free agents Cam
Cleeland and Christian Fauria, and first-round pick Daniel Graham of
Colorado. They also signed 6-foot-4 Donald Hayes, Carolina's leading
receiver last season, giving Brady another big target. Hayes joins
receivers David Patten, Troy Brown and Deion Branch, none of whom is
taller than 5-10.</TE>
<TE>   Put tactfully by running back Antowain Smith: "Now, we have a big
receiver to go with our midgets."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest difference this season is Brady, who by most accounts
makes better and quicker decisions than Drew Bledsoe, the quarterback
he replaced. Eight months ago, in the week leading up to the Super
Bowl, San Diego defensive end Marcellus Wiley, whom Brady had faced
in his third start, wondered if fame might take its toll on the young
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   "[The pressure] will be in the off-season, when all his friends
are patting him on the back, and he's at the bar and everyone's
saying, 'Brady! Brady!' " Wiley said. "All that kicks in, and then he
may miss a workout or two."</TE>
<TE>   But Brady didn't miss a workout. In fact, his attendance record
was so strong, he was awarded one of the best parking spots at
training camp.</TE>
<TE>   He did have some off-season distractions--a trip to the Playboy
mansion, a ride in Donald Trump's personal jet, a stint as a Miss
America judge--but he kept those to a minimum. When the city fathers
in his hometown of San Mateo wanted to have a "Tom Brady Day," he put
the kibosh on that, reminding them he's only 24 and, by his thinking,
doesn't deserve to have a day named in his honor. He settled for a
smaller ceremony at his alma mater, Serra High.</TE>
<TE>   His off-season focus has paid off, at least in the first two
games. He has thrown five touchdown passes and only one interception,
and has completed 69.2% of his passes for a 105.9 rating, third in
the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest key is being decisive," he told reporters in Boston.
"Sometimes I'll watch tape of quarterbacks just standing there
holding the ball, and that does them or me no good at all. You have
to make a quick decision. If there's nothing there, you look
someplace else."</TE>
<TE>   Walsh, who coached Joe Montana and Steve Young, and gave Jeff
Garcia a chance when no one else in the NFL would, said he'd made a
decision on Brady a little too quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought he was a good player with a lot of spunk," he
said. "But no, he's a lot more than that. He's an accurate passer,
agile, quick and decisive. It appears he's headed for greatness."</TE>
<TE>   And, ESPY or no ESPY, the Patriots might be too.</TE>

<HD>Palmer's Legacy Hangs in Balance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MANHATTAN, Kan.</DL>
<LD>He was supposed to go long. Instead, he went short.</LD>
<LD>   With the giant end zone clock flickering and the wind whipping and
the plains roaring late Saturday night, Keary Colbert was supposed to
turn Carson Palmer into a hero.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, he made him look like a bum.</LD>
<TE>   Throwing a fourth-down pass on the last drive of what could have
been a glorious USC comeback, Palmer fired a perfect pass inside the
Kansas State 20-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Colbert was standing back on the 30.</TE>
<TE>   The football bounced on the hard grass, the purple-filled stadium
shook like a dancing Barney, Kansas State won, the Trojans sank,
thousands waved and chanted and jeered.</TE>
<TE>   Then Palmer did what he always does.</TE>
<TE>   He took the blame.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a miscommunication," he said. "If it was anybody's
fault, it was my fault."</TE>
<TE>   Miscommunication? Colbert was told to run a post route and he ran
something else entirely. The kid admitted it. Others confirmed it.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran it wrong," Colbert said. "I screwed up our quarterback. I
wasn't on the same page. It was my fault."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Palmer did what he always does.</TE>
<TE>   He asked for the heat.</TE>
<TE>   "You're the quarterback, you're expected to win, and you didn't
win," he said. "It's on me."</TE>
<TE>   This is why, after Saturday's 27-20 loss, Coach Pete Carroll ran
off the field gesturing and consoling Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   This is why, if things don't change in the next couple of months,
Palmer will leave USC with a legacy as mixed as it is long.</TE>
<TE>   A terrific leader. A stand-up guy. But a quarterback with a
burden.</TE>
<TE>   He has yet to lift himself or his team to a consistent next level.</TE>
<TE>   And now, perhaps the best showcase of his career has become the
most red-faced frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer brought the Trojans to this isolated burg with hopes of
awakening the football nation. He had two great games on his 2002
resume, one of the top passer ratings in the country, and some folks
even starting to hype him for Heisman.</TE>
<TE>   He left town on his back. He had the worst completion percentage
since he became a starter--18 for 47--and his team lost its unbeaten
season and national shine.</TE>
<TE>   During the game, Palmer became USC's career leader in passing
yards and completions and total plays.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it took nearly two dozen paragraphs to mention it.</TE>
<TE>   "I had an opportunity to win this game, and that's what you
want...." he said later, his voice trailing. "You want the ball."</TE>
<TE>   He had the ball during drives that were stalled with five
overthrown or misdirected passes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he also endured six Trojan drops, including four by freshman
Mike Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "That's part of the game, every quarterback has drops," Palmer
said.</TE>
<TE>   He had the ball during drives that stalled because of shaky
decision making, including four third-down passes that were completed
to receivers short of the first down.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he also had the ball during a last drive that, after three
consecutive completions, was strangely slowed when USC called a
running play up the middle, giving the ball to Malaefou MacKenzie for
no gain.</TE>
<TE>   "We popped one on the series before," said Norm Chow, offensive
coordinator, referring to Sultan McCullough's 25-yard touchdown run
on the previous series. "We thought we had a chance to do it again."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes when you're Carson Palmer, it seems as if everything
works against you, including yourself.</TE>
<TE>   He threw a perfect jump-ball pass for Williams in the end zone ...
and Williams jumped at the wrong time.</TE>
<TE>   Yet earlier, he brought the team slowly out of the huddle, leading
to a delay-of-game penalty that led to a punt that led to Kansas
State's game-breaking touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a terrific Kansas State pass rush, he avoided all but two
sacks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he was also assessed an important intentional-grounding
penalty that virtually ended one of USC's comeback drives.</TE>
<TE>   It has been that way for Palmer for five years here.</TE>
<TE>   It seems that for every great victory over UCLA, there awaits a
loss to Utah.</TE>
<TE>   For every great game-winning drive against Auburn, there is a
Saturday night against Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer will probably not remember his records set here as much as
he will remember that USC is the first ranked nonconference visitor
that Kansas State has ever defeated.</TE>
<TE>   How will USC remember him?</TE>
<TE>   The next nine games will decide.</TE>
<TE>   With a raucous defense and emerging young position players, USC is
a team that Palmer could certainly lead to his first and only Rose
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Or not.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good quarterback and he did a nice job for his team," said
Wildcat linebacker Josh Buhl.</TE>
<TE>   Good? Nice?</TE>
<TE>   That describes Carson Palmer exactly, on a night when stronger
adjectives were required.</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>I heard a barking dog on the 16th floor of the Marriott, and knowing
the Dodgers were staying here in a Marriott, I took heart in knowing
the Choking Dogs might still have a little bite left in them.</LD>
<LD>   I wouldn't have been surprised to hear Kevin Brown baying at the
moon--after all, what else has he got to do these days?--but this was
major league barking, excited, agitated and the most life I had
detected in our heroes in some time.</LD>
<LD>   Then the door opened, and a reporter from the Los Angeles Daily
News emerged with Clarabelle on a leash. I guess it's true what they
say about pet owners resembling their mutts.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I know some people have been upset because I've referred to
the Dodgers as Choking Dogs, suggesting that's really cruel. An angry
Alan Sears e-mailed to say: "I hope you can find a new nickname for
Dodgers other than 'Choking Dogs.' I have two dogs and neither one of
them appreciates the comparison."</TE>
<TE>   Clarabelle and Daisy, the Daily News reporter's other mongrel,
were staying in the Marriott at $129 a night with mints on their
pillows because like so many other dogs in the greater Los Angeles
area the Dodgers have given them a bad name, and they just needed to
get away for a while.</TE>
<TE>   (I left the dog at home and brought the wife to the hotel, because
no matter how many times I tell the dog to lie down, it won't.)</TE>
<TE>   "I'm taking Clarabelle and Daisy to the doggy bakery tomorrow,"
the Daily News reporter said, and as you can see it's not only the
dogs who need to get away for a while.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DODGERS will do that to you. They had nine games remaining
against the Padres, 30 1/2 games out of first, and the Rockies, 25
1/2 back, and all they had to do was act like a playoff contender,
crush them, and wait for the Giants to stumble against the Astros or
(possibly) the Braves.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres don't have a player listed in the top 10 in any of the
14 offensive categories listed in National League statistics, and yet
Andy Ashby--now there's one dog with fleas earning $7.5 million a
year--couldn't get an out in the third inning before leaving Friday
night's game. The man who called the media "vultures" earlier this
season has now become road kill every time he takes the mound.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were so bad with everything on the line Friday night
that some guy from the stands named Jonathan Johnson was closing them
out, while Trevor Hoffman sat back and watched. In Milwaukee,
meanwhile, after flying all night from Los Angeles, the Giants
reacted like playoff contenders and won.</TE>
<TE>   At home I can only imagine how badly Maggie, Manager Jim Tracy's
dog, must have felt. "As long as she has fresh water and food, she's
just fine," Tracy said, and if he's that out of touch with his best
friend, it's no wonder he has no idea just how bad off the Dodgers
are.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ON SATURDAY the Choking Dogs were taking batting practice when the
scoreboard noted the Giants had gone up, 3-1. To help, I went to the
Padres' clubhouse and reminded Phil Nevin and Sean Burroughs they had
grown up in the L.A. area, and should be nicer to our guys.</TE>
<TE>   Nevin went 0 for 4, striking out three times, after our chat.
Burroughs had an infield single in four appearances, and made an
error playing second base, but there wasn't much else I could do
other than take the wife for a walk around Seaport Village and hope
for the best.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEWS FLASH: "Man Bites Dog."</TE>
<TE>   Marquis Grissom singles off Hoffman to drive in two and break a
3-3 tie in the ninth for the Dodgers. Give that man a treat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ON ESPN radio this week Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian were
joking about the presumed death of Bison Dele, the former NBA player
who competed for the Chicago Bulls under the name Brian Williams.
McDonnell said he found it "hilarious" that officials were searching
for Dele's body, and while making a joke about sharks, the radio show
added sound effects with someone munching on chips.</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell announced, "I didn't kill him. His own freaking brother
[Miles Dabord] killed him," which apparently means there will be no
need for a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Krikorian then continued the high-level discussion by asking
McDonnell. "Who would you pop a cap into, Joe?" if given the chance
to shoot someone in the head.</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell said he couldn't think of anyone he'd want to kill, but
after some thought, said, "F.B." I guess we know where he stands on
the death penalty, too, at least as it relates to F.B.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE'S A report that as many as seven Mets were using marijuana
this season, which might explain why the team lost 16 straight games
at home. Tough to get upset about losing at home when you don't even
know you're home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LAST WEEK USC Coach Pete Carroll was talking up Carson Palmer for
Heisman Trophy consideration. You know what a kidder Carroll can be.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ON THE bright side, UCLA has probably succeeded in making USC feel
overconfident with the 51-point swing in results against Colorado. I
think Coach Bob Toledo deserves some credit for looking ahead and
setting up the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FERNANDO VARGAS said he "has no problems with God," which is good,
because he couldn't even knock out Oscar De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in the form of a birth announcement:</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of sports editor Bill Dwyre has given birth to a
girl.</TE>
<TE>   The kid obviously takes after her grandpa, already asking for time
off to play golf when it's obvious she can't play the game.</TE>

<KH>COLORADO 31, NO. 20 UCLA 17</KH>
<HD>Buffed and Polished Off</HD>
<DH>UCLA: In a rare September loss, Bruins are trampled for 325
yards rushing by a team that lost to USC by 37 points a week earlier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's the stumble. Is the fall far behind?</LD>
<LD>   Or for the first time in years will UCLA scramble to its feet and
avoid allowing one agonizing afternoon to trigger a collapse?</LD>
<LD>   Many of the Bruins had pushed aside their 31-17 loss to Colorado
by the time they reached the Rose Bowl locker room Saturday, already
bracing for a U-turn.</LD>
<TE>   They certainly don't want to go down the same road as last season,
when one defeat spiraled into four in a row. In 1999 and 2000, two
losses in the next three games followed the first loss.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not going to have another losing streak at UCLA," senior
linebacker Marcus Reese said. "It's not going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado (2-2) must have uttered similar words after its 37-point
loss to USC last week. And rebound the Buffaloes did, punishing the
No. 20 Bruins (2-1), who sauntered in feeling good about themselves
after bullying Colorado State and Oklahoma State.</TE>
<TE>   This time the spiked beanie was on the other noggin.</TE>
<TE>   "They banged on us pretty good," UCLA Coach Bob Toledo said. "That
was a physical football team."</TE>
<TE>   Count UCLA linemen among the casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado outrushed the Bruins, 325-62, behind tailback Chris
Brown's 188 yards in 26 carries. Bruin safeties combined for 24
tackles, a sure sign the linebackers, tackles and ends were getting
blocked.</TE>
<TE>   Buffaloes' quarterback Robert Hodge, a South Bay product who
endured a week of ridicule after completing one pass against USC,
turned in a mistake-free performance. Using a Hodge-podge of
rollouts, screens and play-action, he passed for 117 yards, scrambled
for key yardage and even caught a pass on a trick play that gained 29
yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Buffaloes turned a 10-7 halftime lead into a one-sided
whipping by scoring on their first four second-half possessions,
marching 57, 41, 61 and 82 yards. Colorado had no turnovers and did
not punt in the last 43 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA defense, which was building a reputation as opportunistic
after forcing seven turnovers in two games, was reduced to chasing
ballcarriers from behind. Reese had a career-high 13 tackles, but
many were five to 10 yards downfield.</TE>
<TE>   "Our defense was on the field too long," Reese said. "We didn't
force any turnovers and they put together drives that got us real
tired."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, a bruising 6-foot-3, 220-pound junior, scored three
touchdowns and Robert Purify added 87 yards in 14 carries and 41
yards on two receptions, giving Colorado the look of an offensive
juggernaut.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA had the look of a team that took its opponent lightly.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure we probably caught them off guard after the way we
played last week," Colorado Coach Gary Barnett said. "It's hard to
get your guys up to play a team that showed on film the way we
showed. You understand that's the way the game goes. You fall victim,
that's what humans do."</TE>
<TE>   The Buffaloes were as physical on defense as on offense. Bruin
quarterback Cory Paus was sacked three times and did not try to throw
deep until late in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Paus' longest completion was of 20 yards, a week after connecting
on eight passes longer than 20 against Oklahoma State. He was 21 for
35 for 189 yards with one interception--the game's only turnover.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Drew Olson, who spelled Paus for short periods in the
first two games, did not play.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't appropriate," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   Not on a day when nearly everything the UCLA offense tried failed.
The priority early was to establish a running attack, but tailback
Akil Harris was repeatedly stuffed and finished with 31 yards in 15
carries.</TE>
<TE>   The only big play was a reverse pass of 33 yards by senior
receiver Jon Dubravac to Craig Bragg that opened the scoring on the
first play of the second quarter. Bragg had six other catches,
including a meaningless five-yard touchdown from Paus with four
minutes to play, but all came on short throws.</TE>
<TE>   "Colorado respected us and took away the deep pass," Bragg said.
"We just didn't call many long balls and when we did, we didn't
execute."</TE>
<TE>   Dubravac's touchdown pass marked the first time this season UCLA
scored first, but Colorado answered in four plays, beginning with a
32-yard run by Brown and a seven-yard bootleg by Hodge.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett deployed his own trickery with a reverse that receiver
Derek McCoy took 37 yards to the end zone, but a holding penalty
brought the ball back to the 19. No matter, Brown scored on the next
play, changing direction after encountering traffic at the line of
scrimmage and bolting to the corner of the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's first touchdown in six quarters unleashed a torrent of
points.</TE>
<TE>   It was 99 degrees on the field, five degrees hotter than any game
in Colorado history, but the Buffaloes were just getting warmed up,
driving 67 yards for a field goal 27 seconds before halftime, then
moving the ball with ease throughout the second half.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA fans began filing out with several minutes to play, but a
large contingent of gold-clad Buffaloes' fans among the 63,880 stayed
until the end, giving the Rose Bowl a look of leaves turning in the
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the outcome marked a change in the weather. It was
Toledo's first loss after five victories against the Big 12
Conference. It was Barnett's first victory after five losses against
the Pacific 10.</TE>
<TE>   And it was only UCLA's second defeat in its last 12 September
games. One game remains this month, at San Diego State next week, and
preparing in a positive state of mind will be a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   There is the recent history of one loss triggering another, and
another. There is the rigorous Pac-10 schedule looming.</TE>
<TE>   And to top it off, classes begin Thursday. Ugh.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to stay calm, cool and collected and move on," tight end
Mike Seidman said. "The offense needs to support the defense and the
defense needs to support the offense. We need to pull together, and I
think we will."</TE>

<TE>   Element of Surprise</TE>
<TE>   A look at some of Gary Barnett's unexpected coaching victories:</TE>
<TE>*--*
SEPT. 2, 1995, AT SOUTH BEND, IND
Northwestern 17, No. 9 Notre Dame 15</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   * After winning only eight games in Barnett's first three seasons,
the 27-point underdog Wildcats stun Lou Holtz's Irish behind Darnell
Autry's 160 yards rushing. After the Irish score a touchdown with
6:15 remaining, Notre Dame quarterback Ron Powlus is sacked on a
two-point conversion attempt, securing the victory.</TE>
<TE>*--*
OCT. 7, 1995, AT ANN ARBOR, MICH
No. 25 Northwestern 19, No. 7 Michigan 13</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   * The undefeated Wolverines have a 13-6 lead after quarterback
Brian Griese's scoring run, but the 16-point underdog Wildcats storm
back, scoring 13 unanswered points to spark their magical run to the
Big Ten Conference championship and a trip to the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>*--*
NOV. 23, 2001, AT BOULDER, COLO
No. 14 Colorado 62, No. 2 Nebraska 36</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   * Nebraska is 11-0, No. 1 in the bowl championship series rankings
and a 9 1/2-point favorite over the Buffaloes, but Colorado storms to
a 35-3 lead three minutes into the second quarter. Chris Brown rushes
for 198 yards and a school-record six touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>*--*
DEC. 1, 2001, AT IRVING, TEXAS
No. 9 Colorado 39, No. 3 Texas 37</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   * The Longhorns had routed the Buffaloes, 41-7, on Oct. 20 at
Austin, Texas, are eight-point favorites in the Big 12 Conference
title game and have plenty of incentive as a victory would put them
in the BCS title game. But the Buffaloes' 29-3 first-half scoring
blitz proves to be too much for Texas to overcome.</TE>
<TE>*--*
SATURDAY AT ROSE BOWL
Colorado 31, No. 20 UCLA 17</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   * The Buffaloes, held to 61 yards and four first downs in a
humiliating 40-3 loss at home to USC the previous week, enter the
Rose Bowl as 12-point underdogs. But Colorado grinds out 27 first
downs and 471 yards to end UCLA's nine-game winning streak against
nonconference opponents.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Steve Henson's keys to the game and how the Bruins matched up:</TE>
<TE>   Not falling behind early: Maybe UCLA should stick to the comeback
approach. The Bruins took a short-lived 7-0 lead on a 33-yard reverse
pass from receiver Jon Dubravac to Craig Bragg on the first play of
the second quarter. Colorado tied the score four plays later, went
ahead on a field goal with 27 seconds left in the half and put the
game away in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Slowing the Buffalo running game: The Bruins were trampled, giving
up 325 yards on the ground, including 188 by tailback Chris Brown,
the most against UCLA since Wisconsin's Ron Dayne rushed for 246 in
the 1999 Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Not being surprised by gimmicks: A trick play hurt the Bruins on
first down at the UCLA 41-yard line after Cory Paus had a pass
intercepted early in the third quarter. Robert Hodge tossed a long
lateral to receiver Barry Kunkel, who threw back to Hodge along the
sideline. Hodge ran 29 yards, setting up a touchdown that extended
the Buffaloes' lead to 21-7.</TE>

<KH>No. 25 KANSAS STATE 27, No. 11 USC 20</KH>
<HD>Buffed and Polished Off</HD>
<DH>USC: Kansas State, led by elusive quarterback Roberson,
knocks Trojans from unbeaten ranks as fourth-quarter comeback falls
short.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MANHATTAN, Kan.</DL>
<LD>USC brought big hopes and dreams to this town that bills itself as
the Little Apple.</LD>
<LD>   Another crisp performance, and the No. 11 Trojans were looking at
a possible 3-0 start and very sweet spot in the top 10.</LD>
<LD>   But things turned rotten for the Trojans on Saturday night against
No. 25 Kansas State.</LD>
<TE>   They fell behind by 21 points in the second half and lost, 27-20,
before a crowd of 49,276 at KSU Stadium that left the Trojans in a
purple haze.</TE>
<TE>   "They had the upper hand the whole time," USC Coach Pete Carroll
said. "It was important to seize control early and we didn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   USC (2-1) looked nothing like the team that dominated the final
two quarters of its season-opening victory over Auburn and the entire
game against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   And Kansas State (4-0) proved it was worthy of its ranking after
beating up on Western Kentucky, Louisiana Monroe and Eastern
Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everyone thinks we are playing these pansy teams and they
weren't," Kansas State offensive lineman Nick Leckey said. "They were
just a natural progress for us."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State quarterback Ell Roberson showed he has made progress
since last season, when he led the Wildcats to a 10-6 victory at the
Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   In that game, Roberson ran the option offense and rushed for 119
yards.</TE>
<TE>   He missed Kansas State's last game because of an injured left hand
and senior Marc Dunn started in his place Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But Roberson came off the bench early in the second quarter and
changed the rhythm of the game against a Trojan defense ranked No. 1
in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "How many times did he make something happen when we had him?"
Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Roberson rushed for 78 yards and a touchdown in 20 carries and, in
what came as a surprise to most Trojan defenders, completed 10 of 15
passes for 134 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "My first couple of passes were short as I was pushing it too
much," Roberson said. "My players were telling me, 'Calm down. Calm
down.' [USC] presented some things that made me shine."</TE>
<TE>   Roberson's effort helped the Wildcats beat a ranked opponent in a
nonconference game at home for the first time in school history. It
also extended to 38 the Wildcats' home winning streak against
nonconference opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking for the option a little bit too much," USC
defensive end Omar Nazel said. "We weren't ready up front necessarily
for pass rush. We thought it was going to be run, run, run, and they
just killed us with the pass."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, USC's passing offense faltered.</TE>
<TE>   Trojan quarterback Carson Palmer, who completed nearly 72% of his
passes in the first two games, completed only 18 of 47 attempts for
186 yards and a touchdown against Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Trojan receivers dropped six passes, and Palmer, who was sacked
only once in the first two games, was sacked twice against the
Wildcats. He was also penalized once for intentional grounding.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play a complete game," Palmer said. "We started playing
the fourth quarter and it wasn't enough."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans survived numerous special teams errors last week
against Colorado, but they were hurt against Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Kicker David Davis continued to struggle, missing a 30-yard field
goal attempt in the first quarter that would have given the Trojans a
3-0 lead. Kansas State also blocked an extra-point attempt and
Terence Newman returned it for a two-point play that turned what
should have been a 10-7 USC deficit into a 12-6 halftime lead for
Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Punter Tom Malone also struggled. His 12-yard punt in the third
quarter set up a 29-yard drive that tailback Darren Sproles capped
with a 10-yard touchdown run. That extended the Wildcats' lead to
19-6.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State pushed it to 27-6 on Roberson's nine-yard touchdown
pass to James Terry on the first play of the fourth quarter before
the Trojans started to rally.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Pollard recovered a fumble by Sproles, and Palmer completed a
65-yard drive with a five-yard pass to Keary Colbert, who had 11
catches for 125 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State was forced to punt on its ensuing possession and
Palmer connected with Colbert for a 21-yard pass play that set up
Sultan McCullough's 25-yard touchdown run to make the score 27-20.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State then drove to the USC five, but Roberson fumbled and
safety DeShaun Hill recovered in the end zone for a touchback with
3:04 left.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer completed consecutive passes to Colbert and one to Kareem
Kelly as the Trojans drove to the Kansas State 33. But running back
Malaefou MacKenzie was stopped for no gain on first down, Palmer's
pass to Kareem Kelly fell incomplete and Palmer was sacked on third
down.</TE>
<TE>   USC's comeback bid ended when Palmer overthrew Colbert on
fourth-and-15 from the Wildcat 38.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pleased with the fight we had to come back and get back in
this thing, but I'm frustrated we didn't play better earlier,"
Carroll said. "There were a couple of drives against our defense that
just shouldn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Now, the Trojans will prepare for their Pacific 10 Conference
opener against Oregon State at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Their bid for a perfect season is over, but they are prepared to
shoot for a conference title and possibly more.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we should be 3-0 right now, but we can't have our heads
down," McCullough said. "It came down to the last play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Crunch Time</TE>
<TE>   USC has a 6-9 record in games decided by seven points or fewer
with Carson Palmer at quarterback. However, in only five of those
games was Palmer involved in the game's last drive or a play that
determined the outcome:</TE>
<TE>*--*
SEPT. 9, 2000, AT COLISEUM
No. 11 USC 17, Colorado 14</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   * Palmer leads a 72-yard drive in the final 1:14 that results in
David Newbury's game-winning field goal with 16 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>*--*
NOV. 18, 2000, AT ROSE BOWL
USC 38, UCLA 35</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   * A week after getting pulled at halftime of a loss to Washington
State, Palmer passes for a career-high four touchdowns and leads a
drive in the final 1:05 that results in David Bell's game-winning
field goal with nine seconds left.</TE>
<TE>*--*
SEPT. 8, 2001, AT COLISEUM
No. 12 Kansas State 10, USC 6</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   * Palmer kept several drives alive in the second half by
scrambling for first downs. But on a second-down scramble at the
Wildcat 28 with 2:33 left, he fumbled after trying to bull through
two defenders and Kansas State recovered.</TE>
<TE>*--*
NOV. 3, 2001, AT COLISEUM
USC 16, Oregon State 13</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   * Palmer rolled to his left and ran for a four-yard touchdown that
gave the Trojans an overtime victory.</TE>
<TE>*--*
SATURDAY AT MANHATTAN, KAN
No. 25 Kansas State 27, No. 11 USC 20</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   * Palmer led the Trojans from their 20 to the Wildcat 33 with just
over a minute left, but was sacked and overthrew Keary Colbert on
fourth and 15.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Gary Klein's keys to the game and how the Trojans matched up:</TE>
<TE>   Neutralize Kansas State's big-play special teams and eliminate
Trojan breakdowns: Kicker David Davis missed a 30-yard field-goal
attempt in the first quarter and had an extra-point attempt blocked
near the end of the first half. Kansas State cornerback Terence
Newman recovered the blocked kick and ran for a two-point conversion
that gave the Wildcats a 12-6 lead. Punter Tom Malone also struggled.
He averaged 36.9 yards for 11 punts and his 12-yard punt with five
minutes left in the third quarter gave Kansas State a first down at
the USC 29. The Wildcats scored three plays later for a 19-6 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Establish a running game: The Trojans were hoping for a repeat of
last week when they rushed for 181 yards against Colorado. But Kansas
State loaded up at the line of scrimmage and limited USC to 110.
Sultan McCullough, who gained 110 yards against Colorado, rushed for
73 against Kansas State--25 coming on a fourth-quarter touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Prove cornerbacks are not the weak links in USC pass defense:
Darrell Rideaux and Ronald Nunn expected to be tested, but Nunn left
the game because of a sprained knee in the second quarter and was
replaced by redshirt freshman William Buchanon. Kansas State
quarterback Ell Roberson went after Buchanon on a nine-yard touchdown
pass to James Terry in the fourth quarter.</TE>

<LD>Colorado's 31-17 victory over UCLA Saturday was so thorough that the
Bruins couldn't dispute it or complain about it. The best thing for
UCLA to do would be to learn from it.</LD>
<LD>   This is how you bounce back from a tough defeat: You walk in,
smack some people around and leave with no doubts. The Bruins should
take notes ... once the ringing in their ears subsides.</LD>
<LD>   Colorado came in with a 1-2 record following a 40-3 whack job by
USC that dropped the Buffaloes out of the top 25 and made them prime
candidates for David Letterman's Top 10 list.</LD>
<TE>   "SC took it to us," Colorado Coach Gary Barnett said. "We turned
around and took it to UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   Took it to them? They beat down the Bruins so badly it's a wonder
UCLA didn't press charges. Colorado outrushed UCLA, 325 yards to 62.
The Buffaloes picked up 27 first downs. They had two touchdown drives
that went 80 yards or more and another that lasted 17 plays.</TE>
<TE>   "There were several long series," UCLA defensive tackle Steve
Morgan said. "By the fourth quarter, they pounded us."</TE>
<TE>   "We showed up to play," Colorado guard Marwan Hage said. "We
showed these guys what we're capable of."</TE>
<TE>   The question is, are the Bruins capable of doing the same thing?</TE>
<TE>   You'd think this, their first loss of the year, would be a wake-up
call. But when the alarm goes off the Bruins tend to pull the
blankets over their heads.</TE>
<TE>   They've followed a loss with at least one more defeat seven times
in the past five seasons. Entire seasons can go up in smoke, such as
when the Bruins turned national championship aspirations into
humiliation with back-to-back losses to Miami and Wisconsin (in the
Rose Bowl) in 1998, or when a 6-0 start turned into a four-game
losing streak last year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a new year, this is a new team," UCLA Coach Bob Toledo
said. "We're going to battle back and win more games."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo had better hope that's the case, because he's the one
common element in all of those fold jobs. It's clear he already had
made mental toughness a point to his players, because they were
singing the same song at every locker.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to have any trouble this year," safety Matt Ware
said. "We're unified and we're not even going to worry about it."</TE>
<TE>   "We'll bounce back, because of the way our team is molded,"
running back Akil Harris said. "We have good camaraderie and
everybody's focused in on improvement. Everything's going to fall
into place. We just need to look at this loss and suck it up and come
back next week and work hard."</TE>
<TE>   They're saying all the right things about their mental state. But
this game showed that they might not be able to physically match up
with the roughest and toughest on the block.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's offensive line dominated UCLA, clearing holes so big
that tailback Chris Brown couldn't stop smiling even after he had
left the field and showered following his 188-yard rushing day.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just executing with great attention to detail, I guess,"
Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's leading rusher was Manuel White, with 36 yards in six
carries. The Bruins' offensive line couldn't pass protect, either.
Quarterback Cory Paus threw only one deep ball through the first
three quarters, and Toledo said that was a function of Colorado's
defense getting in Paus' face and forcing him to go short.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins were able to mask their deficiencies in their first two
games because they were plus-five in turnovers. Colorado didn't give
up the ball once Saturday, while Paus threw an interception, and the
truth was revealed.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the game it looked as though UCLA lacked the ability
and confidence to do what it wanted.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins had a great chance to get back in the game in the third
quarter, when they had first down at Colorado's three-yard line.
White was stopped up the middle for a loss of one. Instead of trying
another power play, the Bruins pitched to Harris on second down, and
he was strung out for a four-yard loss. After a five-yard illegal
substitution penalty, a Paus pass to Tab Perry was incomplete and the
Bruins had to settle for a field goal that left them trailing by 11.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins still had the whole fourth quarter to get two
touchdowns, but that was assuming they could stop Colorado and that
wasn't about to happen. The Buffaloes had 10 more points in them,
including a nine-play drive in which they didn't face one third down.</TE>
<TE>   "We were worn down, and they banged on us pretty good," Toledo
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ware said: "It was a good sign to gauge where we have to go, how
physical we have to be, what intensity level we have to play with."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA has one easy way to follow Colorado's example: play San Diego
State next weekend. The Buffaloes came back after losing their opener
to Colorado State and beat the Aztecs a week later.</TE>
<TE>   But you could tell that was nowhere near as redemptive as this
victory following their collapse against USC.</TE>
<TE>   "We hurt so much last week," Barnett said. "The only way to clear
the hurt was to win. We were going to play hard. I knew it."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Toledo knows something too.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be back," he promised.</TE>
<TE>   At least the Bruins won't have to do much soul-searching to find
some answers. A simple review of Saturday's game tapes will do just
fine.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greg Myers took several trips to the batting cage Saturday while the
Oakland Athletics played Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Those jaunts paid off in a big way.</LD>
<LD>   Myers hit a tiebreaking pinch-hit single in the bottom of the
eighth inning, and Oakland's bullpen pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings to
help the first-place A's defeat the Rangers, 6-3, to open a two-game
lead over the Angels in the American League West race.</LD>
<TE>   "Really, anytime you can help out like that it feels good," said
Myers, 36, a reserve catcher. "With this tight race going on, it's
nice."</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 3-3, in the eighth, Myers singled to center
field to drive in Terrence Long from second base. Miguel Tejada
followed with a run-scoring single and the A's scored another run on
an error.</TE>
<TE>   New York 3, Detroit 2--Andy Pettitte (12-5) pitched seven strong
innings at Detroit and became the first pitcher since 1961 to get at
least 12 victories in each of his first eight seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Mariano Rivera pitched a perfect eighth inning in his return from
the disabled list to help the Yankees clinch their fifth consecutive
AL East title.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 14, Minnesota 4--Magglio Ordonez homered twice--giving him
35--and drove in four runs, and Carlos Lee hit a grand slam to lift
host Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The loss assured the AL Central-champion Twins of opening the
postseason on the road Oct. 1, probably against the AL West winner.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, Baltimore 0--John Burkett (12-8) gave up two hits in
eight innings at Baltimore, and Nomar Garciaparra drove in a run and
scored one as Boston avoided elimination in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, Toronto 3--Carl Crawford hit a tiebreaking double in
the eighth inning at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 3, Cleveland 2--Michael Tucker's two-out single in the
bottom of the ninth scored Chuck Knoblauch with the winning run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Cook County judge ordered William Ligue Jr., who Thursday night
ran onto the field at Chicago's Comiskey Park with his 15-year-old
son and attacked Kansas City Royal coach Tom Gamboa, held on $200,000
bond.</TE>
<TE>   During a hearing, a prosecutor described how Ligue telephoned his
sister before the attack and told her to watch the White Sox game
because he was going to be on. When she couldn't find the game on TV,
he told her to watch the news.</TE>
<TE>   Ligue was charged with a felony count of aggravated battery in a
public place of amusement. His son has been charged with two juvenile
counts of aggravated battery, one for attacking Gamboa and the other
for hitting a White Sox security guard, an off-duty police officer.</TE>
<TE>   The teenager is being held in a juvenile detention center and is
due in court Monday.</TE>

<TE>   Toe Nash, 20, a high school dropout signed by the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays last season, was released by the team a day after he was
released from a New Orleans jail after pleading guilty to having sex
with a 15-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   Nash was facing life in prison on three counts of aggravated rape,
according to Arthur Lemann IV, Nash's lawyer. Nash will be on
probation for five years, Lemann said.</TE>
<TE>   Nash batted .240 in 47 games last season with the Princeton Devil
Rays of the Appalachian League.</TE>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>And, throwing out the ceremonial first pitch Saturday, Dave
Henderson.</LD>
<LD>   Taunting? Poor sportsmanship? With the Angels one victory away
from clinching a playoff berth, why would the Seattle Mariners trot
out the player whose name has been cursed by Angel fans since 1986?</LD>
<LD>   That was the year that Henderson hit the two-strike, two-out,
two-run home run that prevented the Angels from advancing to the
World Series. Henderson and the Boston Red Sox got there instead, and
the Angels have not returned to the playoffs since then.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll always be connected with the Angels," Henderson said. "I've
hit a lot of home runs in postseason play. The Angels just haven't
been back, so it makes it a big deal."</TE>
<TE>   Not that Angel fans would care to remember, but Henderson enjoyed
a 14-year career, including that World Series appearance with Boston
and three more with the Oakland Athletics. He played his first six
seasons with Seattle and now works as a broadcaster for the Mariners.
Saturday's first-pitch ceremony was planned long ago, as part of the
Mariners' 25th anniversary celebration, not wickedly arranged to
torment long-suffering Angel fans.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be writing that jinx or curse [stuff]," he said. "That's
baseball."</TE>
<TE>   But, on the day Henderson threw out the first pitch, and on the
day the Angels could have clinched their first playoff bid in 16
years, third baseman Troy Glaus committed a throwing error that led
to four unearned runs. The Angels lost by two.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy threw that ball away. That has nothing to do with me being
here," Henderson said. "Just write down Hendu's not playing this
year, so they have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels sold out tickets for the first round of the playoffs
Saturday, within hours of putting them on sale. Some 2,000 tickets
remain for the regular-season finale against Seattle next Sunday,
with scattered single seats available for the other two remaining
home games Friday and Saturday.</TE>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>It's the old story of how are you going to keep him down on the farm?</LD>
<LD>   Well, next year you're not.</LD>
<LD>   Next year, Francisco Rodriguez is ticketed to bring that live
fastball and smoking slider out of the bullpen as closer Troy
Percival's setup man.</LD>
<TE>   The thing is, the Angels are beginning to think next year can
wait.</TE>
<TE>   The way that the 20-year-old Venezuelan (and, yes, some believe he
might be a little older) is performing in his September showcase now
has the Angels asking:</TE>
<TE>   How are you going to keep him off the playoff roster when he keeps
striking out every major league hitter he faces?</TE>
<TE>   The answer?</TE>
<TE>   There isn't a definitive one yet, but the possibility that the
Angels will find a way to get the power right-hander on their playoff
roster despite his lack of big league experience is increasing.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, in a 6-4 loss to the Seattle Mariners that prevented
the Angels from clinching a playoff berth, Rodriguez again displayed
veteran composure.</TE>
<TE>   He was summoned with two on and one out in the eighth and struck
out Dan Wilson and Jeff Cirillo.</TE>
<TE>   One year removed from Class A, Rodriguez has made three
appearances spanning 2 2/3 innings, striking out seven of the eight
batters he has faced.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to keep doing what I've been doing all year," he
said of his blazing success at triple-A Salt Lake City and double-A
Arkansas. "I like pitching in tough situations. I'm not at all
nervous."</TE>
<TE>   There would be nothing tougher than Yankee Stadium in October.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to happen," a member of the Angel organization
said, meaning Rodriguez could make the playoff roster even though he
wasn't called up before Aug. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Two pitchers, Aaron Sele and Steve Green, are on the disabled
list, and Rodriguez could be named as a replacement.</TE>
<TE>   The choice seems to come down to putting that power arm in a
bullpen without similar power aside from Percival's or keeping Mickey
Callaway in the event a starter gets knocked out early and a long man
is needed. Rodriguez is beginning to make it an easy choice.</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Bud Black wasn't specific in regard to the playoff
roster, but he said of Rodriguez:</TE>
<TE>   "There's no denying his stuff. That's simply one of the best young
arms you'll see. We're trying to get him battled tested."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Angels still have to qualify.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, they delayed the process, doing what they have seldom
done, giving a game away--and it was costly.</TE>
<TE>   They are now two games behind Oakland in the American League West
with seven to play, and it appears they are drawing the wild card.</TE>
<TE>   A throwing error by Troy Glaus on what should have been the third
out of the fifth inning helped turn two runs into six, and Scott
Spiezio was picked off second in the eighth, killing a potential
threat.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels showed their usual fight, rallying from 6-1 before
leaving the bases loaded in the ninth, but there had been bad vibes
from the start.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners arranged for Dave Henderson, a ghost from the Angels'
past, to throw out the first pitch, rekindling memories of his
stake-in-the-heart home run off Donnie Moore in Game 5 of the 1986
league championship series. That was the last time the Angels reached
the playoffs, but Henderson wasn't buying the possibility that his
appearance contributed to their skittish play while failing to get
the win that would have ended the 16-year drought.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, I had nothing to do with it," Henderson said. "You throw a
ball away like [Glaus did], you're going to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez couldn't prevent it, but he kept it close.</TE>
<TE>   Of his stuff, Black said, "He has an easy, smooth but powerful
delivery. The fastball comes out of his hand with so much life, and
there's such tremendous snap to his slider that it's a wipeout pitch.
He had such a tremendous year in the minors that he's going about it
with a ton of confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Between Salt Lake and Arkansas, Rodriguez struck out 129 batters
in 88 1/3 innings, walking only 30 in his first year as a closer.</TE>
<TE>   "He matured in huge leaps and bounds," Salt Lake pitching coach
Mike Butcher said. "It was what the organization has been waiting
for."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bavasi was the general manager in 1998 when Rodriguez was
signed by the Angels for $900,000, the largest bonus they have given
a foreign player. Elbow and shoulder tendinitis delayed his early
progress, as did a lack of focus.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the Angels decided last winter that Rodriguez might
better retain his focus in briefer stints as a closer rather than
continuing to start.</TE>
<TE>   "I was upset about it," Rodriguez said, "but the more times I
pitched out of the bullpen, the stronger my arm became, and I
realized it was a good decision. Pitching just one or two innings at
a time I can be more aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   Percival, the ultimate in aggressiveness, shook his head and said
Rodriguez is akin to lightning.</TE>
<TE>   "That slider of his is absolutely dynamite," he said. "He's going
to come in real handy. Our bullpen has been great, but to have a guy
who can come in and strike out hitters in the seventh and eighth
innings is big. Of course, I don't really think he's 20. I don't know
how old he is, but I think he's been around."</TE>
<TE>   If there's an age discrepancy, what's new?</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said he was raised by his grandparents in Caracas and
has 13 brothers and sisters. His grandfather, for whom he's named,
died three years ago, Rodriguez said, "and I'm sure he's looking down
from heaven and is real proud of what I'm doing. I talk to my mom
[meaning his grandmother, Isabel] two or three times a week and she's
really happy for me. Everything I do is for her."</TE>
<TE>   Whether he gets the opportunity to keep doing it in the playoffs
has yet to be officially decided. He smiled and said: "I didn't know
how many chances I would have to pitch when they called me up, so I
didn't know about the playoffs. It would be great if that happens.
I'll just continue to do what I'm doing."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the hitters haven't had a chance.</TE>

<HD>That's Some 'Slump' for Ichiro</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>As the Mariners sink in the West, Ichiro Suzuki prepares for his
return to the Far East. He will not carry the hardware that he took
back to Japan last year, including the most-valuable-player and
rookie-of-the-year awards (he was only the second player to win both
in the same season), but he will carry some surprising baggage.</LD>
<LD>   Although his statistics for the season remain impressive, Suzuki
was hitting .238, an average befitting a utility player, over his
last 202 at-bats through Friday, which raised issues for the men who
analyze such things.</LD>
<LD>   "We've noticed some loss of intensity when he's in the field and
when he's running out those ground balls he slaps around," said one
of the six New York Yankee scouts here to prepare reports on the
Angels in preparation for a possible playoff meeting.</LD>
<TE>   "We saw him hit a bleeder halfway to the mound earlier in the year
and get to first base in 3.6 [seconds], but now it's almost as if he
gauges if he has a chance before turning it on. I mean, he's still a
very good player, but I think the league has done a better job of
making adjustments to him than he has of making them back."</TE>
<TE>   The scout meant that pitchers have done a better job of keeping
the ball in on Suzuki's hands, preventing him from slapping
opposite-field line drives or grounders to deep short, which his
speed allows him to beat out.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, many of those same pitchers weren't doing a similar job
over the 400 or so at-bats that preceded the last 200, because
Suzuki, despite the falloff over the last six weeks, still will
finish the year with more than 200 hits while batting about .320 with
30 or more stolen bases and a .360-plus average with runners in
scoring position. The fact that he led the league with a .350
average, 242 hits and 56 stolen bases in his U.S. debut last year
underscores the theory that the league caught up with him some.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki has another year on his contract, and Manager Lou Piniella
paints a positive portrait.</TE>
<TE>   "If you only measure what he did this year to last year, you say
to yourself, 'Well, he fell a little short.' If you measure it to
what you expect from any player, he's had a damn good year.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to get 200 hits, he's in the top four or five in the
league in hitting, he has a higher on-base percentage [.389 to .381]
than he did last year, he's gotten 26 intentional walks, which is
unheard of for a leadoff man, he plays a solid outfield and he plays
every day for you.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to remember two things. I probably overplayed him
because of our lack of depth, and he had such a great year last year
that he became the focus on everybody's scouting list as to how to
pitch to him, how to defense him, and he's the guy scouts are saying
'Don't let him get on base because he makes their offense go at the
top of the lineup.'</TE>
<TE>   "What makes a sophomore jinx--and he hasn't had one--is just that,
the added attention and focus, but if Ichiro played here eight more
years and had the year he's having this year each of those eight, I
think everybody would be very pleased."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Humility</TE>
<TE>   Alex Rodriguez arrived in Oakland with his Texas Rangers on
Friday, with Miguel Tejada sitting in the opposite dugout, and
decided to change his self-effacing MVP approach.</TE>
<TE>   "I would vote for myself," Rodriguez said. "Why not? In '96, I
said I wouldn't, and it cost me. I'll be a little less humble this
time."</TE>
<TE>   Juan Gonzalez of Texas won the MVP in '96. Rodriguez, then with
Seattle, was second, followed by Albert Belle of Cleveland and Ken
Griffey Jr., who was A-Rod's teammate and whom he encouraged the two
Seattle writers on the MVP committee, Bob Finnegan and Jim Street, to
vote for. His mantra at the time was: "How can I be MVP of the league
when I'm not even the MVP on my team?"</TE>
<TE>   In Oakland, however, Rodriguez said: "Sure, I'd be disappointed if
I'm not the MVP. I've been in the race three or four times. I've come
close--'96 was my closest. The two local writers didn't vote for me,
and that hurt. I'll never forget those guys. They really helped
motivate my career."</TE>
<TE>   Well, isn't that something?</TE>
<TE>   Two writers helped motivate his career, not money and pride?</TE>
<TE>   And it was the two Seattle writers?</TE>
<TE>   A-Rod is confused, geographically and otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Both Finnegan and Street had Rodriguez high on their ballots but
behind Griffey, as he had urged. Rodriguez finished three points out
of first and has berated John Hickey, now with the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, more than once. Hickey had A-Rod seventh on his
ballot but was then working for a Bay Area newspaper, hardly a "local
writer."</TE>
<TE>   Split Decision</TE>
<TE>   The A's have lost to the Yankees in the opening round of the last
two American League playoffs and would seem to have had enough of
that route, which they would have to follow again if they lose the
division title to the Angels, but they offered mixed opinions after
they beat the Angels on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Eric Chavez cited the sideshow of a playoff
encounter with former teammate Jason Giambi and said: "I don't want
to play the Yankees. I've always felt that besides having them knock
us out the last two years, the series itself would take second stage
because the whole Jason thing would overshadow the playoffs. It would
be Jason and the A's instead of the Yankees and the A's. Let's see
somebody else in the first round. If we get to the second round and
see the Yankees, so be it."</TE>
<TE>   However, pitcher Tim Hudson, thinking about the A's Big Three of
Barry Zito, Mark Mulder and himself, said: "I think we'd have a
better chance to beat the Yankees in a five-game series than a
seven-game series. I don't know the rotation plans, but I think we'd
have a better chance to beat them if we go with a three-man
rotation--and that would give us another quality arm in the bullpen
with Cory Lidle."</TE>
<TE>   Pot Party</TE>
<TE>   New York Met General Manager Steve Phillips can demean the Newsday
report that marijuana use was rampant among the Mets and throughout
the Met system as being largely based on anonymous sources, but there
is one irrefutable fact:</TE>
<TE>   Baseball has no meaningful drug policy that would include testing
for all banned substances. A game played on grass may never be free
of grass, but it requires more than a toothless steroid plan and a
policy that tests only those already known to have used. Perception
is everything.</TE>

<HD>No. 6 Ohio State Edges Cincinnati</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So close to pulling off an upset that would have rocked the Buckeye
state and the national rankings, Cincinnati Coach Rick Minter found
little to feel good about.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no solace in playing them close," Minter said. "We had a
chance to win the ballgame, and we didn't take it."</LD>
<LD>   Cincinnati receivers dropped two touchdown passes in the last
minute, and Ohio State quarterback Craig Krenzel ran for a late
touchdown as the sixth-ranked Buckeyes slipped past the Bearcats,
23-19, Saturday at Cincinnati in front of 66,319.</LD>
<TE>   Ohio State (4-0) was playing in Cincinnati for the first time in
91 years, against a team that had defeated the Buckeyes only twice in
12 tries--in 1896 and 1897.</TE>
<TE>   Ahead, 19-17, midway through the fourth quarter, the Bearcats
(1-2) lost the ball and eventually the lead when Ohio State defensive
end Darrion Scott leveled quarterback Gino Guidugli with a blind-side
hit at the Ohio State 44.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State took the lead on Krenzel's twisting six-yard scramble
with 3:44 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Bearcats gamely came back one more time, as Guidugli led a
drive from his own 20 to the Buckeye 15 with 1:01 left.</TE>
<TE>   On first down, Guidugli threw a pass to the right corner of the
end zone, where Jon Olinger had beaten his defender, but he dropped
the ball. On third down, George Murray dived for a pass in the end
zone, but it slipped through his hands. Will Allen intercepted
Guidugli's fourth-down pass with 26 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 Michigan 10, Utah 7--With a minute left, Julius Curry got
his second interception of the game to preserve the victory for the
Wolverines (3-1) at Ann Arbor, Mich. Utah (2-2) pulled to within
three on a 29-yard touchdown pass from Lance Rice to Travis
LaTendresse with 5:58 left.</TE>
<TE>   No. 15 Penn State 49, Louisiana Tech 17--Larry Johnson ran for 147
yards and two touchdowns in 17 carries and had a third touchdown
receiving to lead the Nittany Lions (3-0) at State College, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose State 38, Illinois 35--Nick Gilliam kicked a 37-yard
field goal on the last play as the Spartans won at Champaign, Ill.
The Spartans (2-2) got four touchdown runs from tailback Lamar
Ferguson and 408 yards passing from Scott Rislov. Illinois (1-3) tied
it at 35-35 with 1:21 left when Jon Beutjer, who completed 28 of 38
passes for 426 yards, passed to Aaron Moorehead for a 32-yard
touchdown pass, before Rislov started the winning drive.</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest 24, Purdue 21--Chris Barclay ran for three touchdowns
and the Demon Deacons (2-2) capitalized on five Boilermaker turnovers
to win at West Lafayette, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern 49, Navy 40--Jason Wright ran for 186 yards and three
touchdowns and Brett Basenez threw for 260 yards and a touchdown as
the Wildcats (2-2) won at Annapolis, Md.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa 48, Utah State 7--Brad Banks ran for one touchdown and passed
for another and Jermelle Lewis had a 75-yard touchdown run for the
Hawkeyes (3-1) at Iowa City, Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 39, Central Michigan 29--Yamar Washington ran for 130
yards and three touchdowns and the Hoosiers (2-2) scored the last 23
points to win at Bloomington, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 41, Buffalo 17--Freshman Jared Ellerson caught two
touchdown passes from Asad Abdul-Khaliq for the Gophers (4-0) at
Minneapolis.</TE>

<HD>Texas A&amp;M Falls to Virginia Tech</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coach Frank Beamer took No. 7 Virginia Tech into hostile territory,
hoping to find out just how good the Hokies really are.</LD>
<LD>   Playing in a stadium where no nonconference visitor had won since
1988, facing a defense that gave up 33.5 rushing yards per game, the
seventh-ranked Hokies earned a hard-fought victory by defeating
19th-ranked Texas A&amp;M, 13-3, Saturday at College Station, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   "I couldn't be more proud," Beamer said. "We've beaten three
ranked opponents, but until you go up on the road and beat a good
team, that's what you can put your stamp on. We're going to enjoy
this one."</LD>
<TE>   Over the previous two weeks, Virginia Tech (4-0) easily beat
then-No. 14 Louisiana State and stomped then-No. 16 Marshall. Those
games were in front of home crowds in Blacksburg, Va., as was an
opening rout of Arkansas State.</TE>
<TE>   This one wasn't nearly as easy.</TE>
<TE>   With only a few hundred orange-clad Hokies fans among the crowd of
83,746, Virginia Tech got behind for the first time this season,
didn't go ahead until the third quarter then finally gained control
in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   And it wasn't the offense, led by the backfield of Lee Suggs and
Kevin Jones, that came up with the biggest plays. It was a defense
that came in with stats nearly as good as Texas A&amp;M's "Wrecking
Crew."</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to show we're right up there with the Wrecking Crew,"
said linebacker Vegas Robinson, whose interception set up the field
goal that put Virginia Tech up, 6-3, early in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Hokies had two interceptions, a key fumble recovery and five
sacks--two coming on consecutive plays by defensive ends Nathaniel
Adibi and Cols Colas, which pushed one of the Aggies' best drives
back to midfield and forced a punt.</TE>
<TE>   On the ensuing drive, Bryan Randall threw a short pass to Ernest
Wilford. He bounced out of a tackle by Byron Jones and ran 52 yards
to the Texas A&amp;M one. Suggs plunged in from there, putting Virginia
Tech up by 10 early in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Suggs ran 13 times for 51 yards, and Jones carried 15 times for 48
yards. They had been averaging a combined 202.3 yards. Bryan Randall
was 10 of 11 for 119 yards--nearly half on Wilford's burst--as the
Hokies had only 248 total yards.</TE>
<TE>   Texas A&amp;M is 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Texas 41, Houston 11--Cedric Benson ran for 160 yards in 37
carries and Chris Simms passed for two touchdowns as the Longhorns
(3-0) won at Austin, Texas. Beau Trahan scored a touchdown on a fake
field goal and Michael Huff returned an interception for Texas. Simms
was sharp for the third consecutive game, completing 20 of 30 passes
for 233 yards. Houston (2-2) managed only 152 yards of total offense.</TE>
<TE>   No. 17 North Carolina State 51, Texas Tech 48--Freshman T.A.
McLendon scored his school record-tying fifth rushing touchdown in
overtime to help the Wolfpack (5-0) win at Lubbock, Texas. McLendon
had 150 yards in 32 carries. Texas Tech (2-2) scored four touchdowns
in the fourth quarter and the game went into overtime. The Red
Raiders got a 33-yard field goal from Robert Treece in overtime
before McLendon won it. In the anticipated quarterback matchup, North
Carolina State's Philip Rivers passed for 301 yards but no
touchdowns, and Texas Tech's Kliff Kingsbury threw for 273 yards and
three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Iowa State 42, Troy State 12--Seneca Wallace passed for 295
yards and three touchdowns and ran for another and Todd Miller scored
on a punt return for the second time this season as the Cyclones
(4-1) won at Ames, Iowa. Playing as a ranked team for the first time
in 21 years, Iowa State also scored off a blocked punt and dominated
Troy State (1-3), which gave Nebraska trouble three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State 52, Southern Methodist 16--Seymore Shaw scored
three touchdowns and Josh Fields threw three touchdown passes in a
45-point first half for the Cowboys (2-2) at Stillwater, Okla. The
Cowboys (2-2) scored all seven times they had the ball in their
most-productive half since scoring 45 points against Wyoming in the
second half of the 1988 Holiday Bowl. SMU is 0-4</TE>
<TE>   Bowling Green 39, Kansas 16--Josh Harris had 236 yards in total
offense and scored three touchdowns and Joe Alls rushed for a
career-high 161 yards as the Falcons (3-0) defeated the Jayhawks
(1-3) at Lawrence, Kan. Linebacker Mitch Hewitt scored a defensive
touchdown for the second consecutive game for Bowling Green.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor 37, Tulsa 25--Aaron Karas threw for a touchdown and ran for
another for the Bears (2-2) at Waco, Texas. Baylor drove 85 yards for
a touchdown on its first possession. Tulsa (0-4) has the nation's
longest active losing streak at 14.</TE>

<HD>It Seems Like Old Times for Cal in Loss</HD>
<DH>Nonconference: Triple option helps Air Force rush for 295
yards and hand Golden Bears first loss of season, 23-21.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>California lost, so what's the big deal?</LD>
<LD>   Cal lost its first 10 games of the season last year and hasn't had
a winning season since 1993, so how come it hurt so much Saturday
when Air Force slugged out a 23-21 victory before a half-filled
Memorial Stadium crowd of 31,816?</LD>
<LD>   Why?</LD>
<TE>   Because first-year Cal Coach Jeff Tedford, in three weeks, had
white-washed a decade of negative thoughts and pushed the Golden
Bears to a 3-0 start and a top-25 ranking.</TE>
<TE>   "Shocking," Cal receiver Jonathan Makonnen said of the defeat.
"Everything had gone our way. I guess reality kicked in."</TE>
<TE>   The reality is that California is so head-and-shoulders better
than it was a year ago it's not even funny, but it's also true that
the Bears can't defeat No. 15 Michigan State on the road one week and
think home victories against Air Force are somehow automatic.</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 Cal (3-1) found out the hard way, frittering away chances,
settling for five field goals that could have been touchdowns,
dropping at least 10 Kyle Boller passes and taking the brunt of an
anachronistic Air Force triple-option run offense that continues to
flourish in the face of 21st century thinking.</TE>
<TE>   The good news for Cal is that it never will again this season meet
up with the likes of Air Force, a team that on Saturday could rush
for 295 yards, pass for 22 and call it perfect execution on offense.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force is 3-0 this season and always an astonishment, led most
recently by quarterback Chance Harridge's courageous and clutch runs.</TE>
<TE>   Harridge rushed for 124 yards in 25 carries and all but provided
the dagger with his 13-yard scamper for a score with 1:59 left to put
the Falcons up, 23-15.</TE>
<TE>   After the score, Harridge promptly ran to the bench and collapsed
from exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   How do you prepare for the option? Cal found out that you don't.
It is so unique and foreign to the college game that stopping it is
like trying to use gum to plug holes in a dam break.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait to play a normal offense again," defensive end Tully
Banta-Cain said.</TE>
<TE>   With his team trailing, 9-3, at the half, Harridge scored on three
second-half runs, capping drives of 65, 57 and 45 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We just started running the triple option right at them, and they
just couldn't stop it," Harridge said. "We ran right at them for the
entire second half of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Any arguments?</TE>
<TE>   Harridge's last touchdown appeared to seal the victory for Air
Force, but a late California rally proved these Golden Bears may
actually have fortitude.</TE>
<TE>   Boller overcame four drops on the team's last drive, all by
receiver LaShaun Ward, to give his team a chance to send the game to
overtime, cutting the Air Force lead to two with 31 seconds left on a
17-yard scoring pass to Makonnen.</TE>
<TE>   Cal need a two-point conversion to tie but was denied when
defensive back Jeff Overstreet deflected away Boller's potential
game-tying pass, intended for Joe Igber.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll probably have nightmares about it, that guy's hand," Boller
said of Overstreet's play. "He couldn't have timed it more perfectly.
He just knocked it down. It was close, really close."</TE>
<TE>   Overstreet said Boller tipped the play off.</TE>
<TE>   "The quarterback's eyes were looking straight at No. 20,"
Overstreet said. "He threw the ball to him and I just put my hand in
front of it."</TE>
<TE>   Cal's last-gasp chance to win was extinguished when Air Force's
Tom Heier recovered the ensuing on-side kick.</TE>
<TE>   On that subject, Cal left the game kicking itself for accepting
three points instead of six.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Jensen set a school record with his five field goals, yet
admitted that it was "at the expense of the offense."</TE>
<TE>   Against a resilient and variant Air Force defense, California
sputtered until the very end.</TE>
<TE>   Most of it was not Boller's fault, and his numbers suffered: He
finished having completed only 13 of 37 passes for 216 yards.</TE>
<TE>   With all the drops, you couldn't have blamed Boller for organizing
a sit-in at midfield.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, it is perhaps a sign of his maturity that he maintained his
composure.</TE>
<TE>   Boller kept throwing at Ward on the last drive, even as the crowd
moaned and the receiver's confidence waned.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the Pac-10 coming up," Boller said. "The last think I
want is for guys' heads to drop. Every game in the Pac-10 is going to
be like today."</TE>
<TE>   With conference play opening next week, Cal remains the Pac-10's
most befuddling team. Barred from going to a bowl this year because
of NCAA probation--no one is expecting the sanctions to be overturned
on appeal--the Golden Bears are now out to wreck the Rose Bowl dreams
of several remaining contenders.</TE>
<TE>   You don't think Cal has a dog in this hunt?</TE>
<TE>   Next week, the school plays host to pre-season favorite Washington
State at Memorial Stadium, then plays at Washington, at USC, plays
host to UCLA and then goes to Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Bears' goal is simple:</TE>
<TE>   "Get respect," Makonnen, the receiver, said. "We want to get
respect in the Pac-10 and we're going to do that, regardless of going
to a bowl or not. You've got to get respect."</TE>
<TE>   Funny, Air Force was looking for the same thing Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   And got it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Willis McGahee had 221 total yards and top-ranked Miami scored three
touchdowns during a three-minute span of the fourth quarter to defeat
Boston College, 38-6, Saturday night at Miami and extend the
Hurricanes' winning streak to 26 games.</LD>
<LD>   McGahee ran 17 times for 135 yards and caught three passes for 86
yards. He had three huge plays that led to three of Miami's five
touchdowns. McGahee, who ran for 204 yards at Florida two weeks ago,
now has 533 yards rushing in four games.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Ken Dorsey completed 13 of 26 for 202 yards and two
touchdowns as Miami (4-0, 2-0 Big East) won its 19th consecutive
conference game and 13th in a row over Boston College (2-1, 0-1).</LD>
<TE>   With Miami on the verge of trailing at halftime for the first time
in two years, McGahee broke four tackles and ran 48 yards to set up a
first-and-goal at the Boston College one-yard line with less than a
minute left. He scored on the next play to give Miami a 10-6 lead at
halftime.</TE>
<TE>   On Miami's second play of the third quarter, McGahee started
right, cut back to the left and ran 32 yards to set up a first-and-10
from the 18. He scored five plays later.</TE>
<TE>   Then in the fourth quarter, McGahee took a screen pass in the
right flat and ran 77 yards to set up a first-and-goal at the three.
Dorsey passed to Kellen Winslow for a one-yard touchdown three plays
later.</TE>

<HD>Doubles Team Gives U.S. a French Twist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Don't count out the U.S. Davis Cup team just yet.</LD>
<LD>   James Blake and Todd Martin came back to beat Mickael Llodra and
Fabrice Santoro in five sets Saturday, allowing the United States to
stave off elimination in the semifinals against defending champion
France.</LD>
<LD>   Blake's smash ended the 2-6, 7-6 (2), 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 doubles
victory as the U.S. team narrowed its deficit to 2-1 in the
best-of-five series on clay at Roland Garros, home of the French
Open.</LD>
<TE>   "This feels great," Blake said. "It got us back into this, and now
we've got a chance to win tomorrow. That's what makes the Davis Cup
so exciting."</TE>
<TE>   In the other Davis Cup semifinal, at Moscow, Wimbledon finalist
David Nalbandian and Lucas Arnold outlasted Russia's Yevgeny
Kafelnikov and Marat Safin, 6-4, 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 19-17, in a match
that lasted more than six hours. The victory drew Argentina to within
2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Blake and Andy Roddick, beaten in Friday's singles matches, both
must win today for the U.S. to avoid elimination. The last time a
U.S. Davis Cup squad won after trailing, 2-0, was in 1934 against
Australia. Roddick plays Sebastien Grosjean, and Blake plays Arnaud
Clement today.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really excited for tomorrow," said Blake, who beat Clement in
their only previous match, at Cincinnati last month. Roddick and
Grosjean never have played each other in competition, but the two
have trained together in Boca Raton, Fla., where they live.</TE>
<TE>   The United States holds the Davis Cup record of 31 titles. Its
last victory was in 1995 and it hasn't reached a final since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the guys will have learned a lot from what happened
yesterday," U.S. captain Patrick McEnroe said. "It's going to be
tough, but these guys learn quickly."</TE>

<HD>Dele's Brother May Not Live to Tell His Tale</HD>
<DH>Crime: With Dabord in a coma, a detailed account of
possible multiple murder comes from his former girlfriend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE and DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As their key potential witness slipped deeper into a coma, law
enforcement officials admitted Saturday that they might never know
exactly what happened to a missing former NBA player and two others
who are presumed dead in the waters of the South Pacific.</LD>
<LD>   Miles Dabord, whom authorities want to question in connection with
the disappearances of his brother, former Clipper Bison Dele, and two
others, is "dead, living only through artificial means," his mother
said.</LD>
<LD>   Patricia Phillips said doctors have discovered severe damage to
her son's brain--injuries they have told her are the result of an
insulin overdose and Dabord not taking his asthma medication.</LD>
<TE>   Dabord, 35, has been on life support at Scripps Hospital in Chula
Vista for the past week after being found unconscious in Mexico. He
had been the subject of a three-nation manhunt on forgery and
identification theft charges after allegedly trying to purchase
$152,000 in gold using his missing brother's check and
identification.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips said the decision on whether to remove Dabord from life
support was "inevitable." She said she plans to meet with a
neurologist Monday to assess her son's brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   Dabord's incapacity has left law enforcement officials to rely on
forensics and second- and third-hand information about Dabord's
suspected role in the early July disappearances of Dele, 33; his
girlfriend, Serena Karlan, 30; and Bertrand Saldo, 32, the captain of
Dele's 55-foot catamaran, the Hakuna Matata.</TE>
<TE>   The most detailed account--though viewed with skepticism by law
enforcement officials--has come from Erica Weise, Dabord's former
girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Weise arrived in Tahiti on July 8--the day after authorities now
believe Dele, Karlan and Saldo were killed on the high seas.
Authorities in the U.S. and Tahiti say she told investigators that
Dabord's explanation went this way:</TE>
<TE>   The brothers were fighting on the boat. When Karlan and Saldo
tried to separate them, Dabord accidentally hit both Karlan and Saldo
with his fists. The blow to Karlan knocked her backward and she hit
her head in the fall, killing her instantly. Saldo, who wasn't
seriously injured, wanted to summon authorities by radio when he was
confronted by Dele, who didn't want police called.</TE>
<TE>   When Saldo objected, Dele slugged him over the head with a wrench,
killing him.</TE>
<TE>   Then, according to what Weise told investigators, Dele turned on
Dabord, demanding that he keep quiet about the killings and
threatening him. It was then, the woman said Dabord told her, that in
self-defense he picked up a gun that was on board and shot his
brother. The bodies were tossed into the sea by Dabord after he tied
weights to them.</TE>
<TE>   Weise returned to her home in Sonoma County on July 15, after
cruising between Tahiti and the neighboring island of Moorea with
Dabord.</TE>
<TE>   Contacted Saturday, Weise confirmed those details, but she
disputed a San Francisco newspaper report that alleged she was aware
of the deaths during her Tahitian visit. She said Dabord informed her
of his alibi in the days after he was questioned by Phoenix police,
Sept. 5, for trying to identify himself as Dele and write a check
from his brother's account to purchase gold coins from a Phoenix
merchant.</TE>
<TE>   Weise said she told Sonoma County Sheriff's detectives of Dabord's
story Sept. 9, then repeated it to FBI officials in San Francisco on
Sept. 10. Weise on Saturday refused to say whether she believed
Dabord's version of the story.</TE>
<TE>   Upon hearing from Weise, the FBI opened a crime on the high seas
case and pursued Dabord for questioning. The Phoenix police also
issued a warrant for his arrest on the forgery and identity
theft--charges that were dropped Saturday, authorities said, because
of Dabord's condition.</TE>
<TE>   Those charges can be reinstated should Dabord awaken. "What
greater price can Miles pay now for crimes alleged or proven?"
Phillips asked. "Miles has lost his life and his brother is dead."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials say they have not entirely ruled out the
scenario Weise said Dabord relayed to her. They also haven't found
any evidence that it's true. A highly placed South Pacific law
enforcement official said late Friday that Dabord's story raised more
questions than it answered.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if the deaths occurred as he said they did, why
didn't Dabord call police immediately and perhaps save evidence that
might have exonerated him?</TE>
<TE>   "We have to consider it," said the law enforcement source, who
requested anonymity. "But we don't think it's true, not if you
consider all that happened after."</TE>
<TE>   John Steiner, an FBI special agent based in San Rafael, Calif.,
added, "Given [Dabord's] behavior afterward, [his boat story] doesn't
add up. But we're at a preliminary point in our investigation. We
have the story. We're trying to determine if it's true or false.</TE>
<TE>   "Our investigation is looking at every potential possibility. At
this point, we haven't ruled out anything. We're working on the
timeline, and we have more witnesses we'd like to talk to, including
Miles."</TE>
<TE>   If Dabord had been hesitant to keep quiet, investigators wonder
why he so quickly changed his mind. In the days after the rest of the
crew disappeared, Dabord cleaned the boat and witnesses told police
they saw a man resembling Dabord throwing wetsuits from the boat into
a trash container.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a Tahitian newspaper published a photograph they
believe was taken in mid-July of Dabord and Weise standing on the aft
deck of Dele's boat.</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose you have been the witness of a triple death," the law
enforcement source said. "Do you think you would spend the next eight
days living in a rather normal way?"</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the boat was registered at a dock in the Tahitian
town of Taravao as the "Aria Bella" in mid-July, and "Hakuna Matata"
was painted over. A man fitting Dabord's description used an alias to
register the boat, a 55-foot catamaran.</TE>
<TE>   "This story [Dabord allegedly told Weise] is so suspect," a member
of Karlan's family said. "The way [Dabord] casts himself as an
innocent.... This is a pathological liar telling another of his
stories. If there's any truth to it, all I want to know from him is
where he dumped the bodies."</TE>
<TE>   Said Phillips: "I know my son ... is dead--the rest of these
events and stories have no significance to me. What has significance
to me is the story no one can tell me because my two boys are dead
now. The only story I want to know is what was in the hearts and
minds of both of them when this happened."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say they believe the case's next big break might come
from an examination of calls made from the catamaran's phone, which
might give them the location of the boat at certain key times.</TE>

<HD>It's Nothing Doing for Ashby After Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>His right middle finger was bandaged, but the obvious pain was on
Andy Ashby's face Saturday afternoon as he sat at his locker stall
before the game and discussed his pitching performance the night
before, a performance that may have ended his season.</LD>
<LD>   Hampered by a blister on that finger, Ashby gave up six
consecutive hits and five runs in the third inning of a game the
Dodgers went on to lose, 8-4. In his last 20 1/3 innings, Ashby has
surrendered 22 runs and 34 hits.</LD>
<LD>   "The blister is sore," Ashby said. "That's embarrassing to say. It
sounds like an excuse. But it's just getting worse. It's cracking and
getting deeper. It seems like it's worse every time I go out there.
It's ridiculous to sit here and talk about a blister, but it feels
like the end of your finger is on fire. The ball doesn't come off
your finger right and everything is different."</LD>
<TE>   Ashby gave up two singles but held the Padres scoreless over the
first two innings. Then, facing San Diego right-hander Brett Tomko in
the third, Ashby took a swing that further inflamed his aching
finger.</TE>
<TE>   "I hit a ball foul off the end of the bat," he said, "and my
finger stung like crazy."</TE>
<TE>   When he took the mound again in the bottom of the inning, he
wasn't the same.</TE>
<TE>   "I got the pitches over the plate, but I couldn't get an out,"
Ashby said. "It's not fair to the team. I'm not giving us a chance to
win."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby said he knows of nothing that can be done medically to
alleviate the problem if he continues to pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the rubbing against the leather and the seams of the ball
that tears it up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So what now?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to take a couple of days off and not throw at all,"
Ashby said after meeting with Manager Jim Tracy and pitching coach
Jim Colborn. "After that we'll see, but it's not good."</TE>
<TE>   Said Tracy: "He will do nothing for the next few days. He won't
play catch. Nothing."</TE>
<TE>   His pitching worn as thin as the skin on Ashby's ailing finger as
the season wears down to a few days, Tracy can hope only for a
miraculous recovery by his pitcher.</TE>

<TE>   Update--With holes all through his rotation, Tracy needs a solid
performance from the inconsistent Daal, who is 0-3 with a 12.60 ERA
in his last three starts. In his last outing, Daal lasted only 1 2/3
innings, his season low as a starter, against the San Francisco
Giants, giving up five runs. This is the final home game of the
season for the Padres.</TE>

<LD>You can make a pretty good case for each of the five 2-year-olds in
today's featured Barretts Juvenile. While there is plenty of
potential here, it's interesting that there's only one winner in the
cast as they battle it out for a $100,000 purse.</LD>
<LD>   Even though he had to settle for second in his debut last month at
Del Mar, Elan appears the one to beat from the cozy rail slot with
G.F. Almeida giving directions. The Wolf Power colt fetched $100,000
this spring when he passed through the local sales ring, which makes
him eligible for this rich affair.</LD>
<LD>   He was all the rage at the windows in that Del Mar unveiling,
going off the 4-5 choice, but he was unable to hold off a Bob Baffert
trainee in deep stretch that afternoon and had to be happy with an
exacta completion. He continues to work sharply for Chris Paasch and
gets the nod.</LD>
<TE>   Cheverly Gold was a solid third in his only trip to the post at
Del Mar for Jeff Mullins and figures to attract his share of
attention off that outing with Martin Pedroza taking over the riding
duties. Despite a slow start, he was making some good late headway
and figures to benefit by the outing.</TE>
<TE>   The only one in here with a winning snapshot is Charmer Baron, who
romped home in his second outing at Hollywood Park in June and has
come back to try stakes company and finish second with
starter-allowance types.</TE>
<TE>   Experience can be very helpful on this tricky course, and he has
four starts under his belt, while his rivals are each making only
their second attempts.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. The Grind 2. Miss Wildgoose 3. Candita 4. Omega Code
5. Miner's Music 6. Breathless 7. Sheza Gladiator 8. Our Blazing
Belle 9. Dixie Law 10. Elan 11. Mikemagillicutty</TE>

<HD>Florida's Turn to Reign Over Tennessee</HD>
<DH>Southeastern: Bad weather doesn't hinder No. 10 Gators in
30-13 win over fumble-prone No. 4 Volunteers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KNOXVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Not so fast, Gator Haters.</LD>
<LD>   Rex Grossman threw two of his three touchdown passes during a
24-point scoring spree late in the second quarter as No. 10 Florida
surprised No. 4 Tennessee, 30-13, on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "Every win is big, but obviously this is a big one and I'm going
to enjoy it a lot," Florida Coach Ron Zook said. "At the same time,
we're still not where we need to be, but we're getting better and
better."</LD>
<TE>   In a splish-splashing five-minute span to close the first half,
the Gators (3-1, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) made their point before
a disbelieving crowd of 108,722 at Neyland Stadium. While the
Volunteers (2-1, 0-1) fumbled seven times in the rainy first half,
Florida thrived under the Swamp-like conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "The conditions were not real conducive to hanging on to the
ball," Zook said, "but we were fortunate to hold on to it more than
they were."</TE>
<TE>   The Gators now have taken control of the SEC East and also remain
in national championship contention despite a 41-16 loss two weeks
ago to No. 1 Miami that had fans worried about the team's direction
under Zook.</TE>
<TE>   The Volunteers were bitterly disappointed after losing a game they
expected to win.</TE>
<TE>   "That second quarter was an embarrassment. I apologize to the fans
and to the people who follow Tennessee football," Coach Phillip
Fulmer said.</TE>
<TE>   When the rain subsided in the second half, Tennessee tried to come
back when Casey Clausen threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Derrick
Tinsley, and Jabari Davis scored from a yard out to get the Vols to
within 24-13. But the Gators refused to fold. Grossman threw his
third scoring pass--a 21-yarder to Taylor Jacobs--with 10:49 left.</TE>
<TE>   Grossman revived his Heisman Trophy chances by completing 20 of 34
passes for 324 yards and two interceptions. Jacobs, who caught a
seven-yard TD pass in the second quarter, finished with nine catches
for 141 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "Grossman, in my opinion, probably won the Heisman tonight,"
Fulmer said.</TE>
<TE>   Clausen, who fumbled four times and lost one, completed 30 of 44
passes for 285 yards.</TE>
<TE>   After a scoreless first quarter, the rain began falling heavily,
and that's when the Gators swamped the Vols. In a sequence that saw
Tennessee fumble the ball on four consecutive plays, the Gators ran
to a 24-0 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's flurry began with controversy on Earnest Graham's
one-yard touchdown run with 4:55 left in the second quarter. On
fourth-and-goal, Graham appeared to be stopped for no gain. But
officials ruled the ball had crossed the goal line. Replays were
inconclusive.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee's troubles quickly worsened. On the Vols' first play
after the score, Clausen fumbled the snap and Marcus Oquendo-Johnson
recovered for the Gators at the Tennessee 24.</TE>
<TE>   Three plays later, Grossman passed to Carlos Perez for a 28-yard
TD pass, threading the ball into the end zone between four Tennessee
defenders with 3:40 left.</TE>
<TE>   On the ensuing kickoff, Corey Larkins fielded it on a bounce and
fumbled it away, and Florida's Johnny Lamar recovered at the 20. But
Tennessee temporarily turned back the Gators when Grossman's pass was
tipped and intercepted by Rashad Baker at the one.</TE>
<TE>   Clausen fumbled the next two snaps but managed to fall on the ball
each time.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Clinches No. 1 Playoff Seed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>For 93 minutes, the Galaxy and San Jose Earthquakes went at each
other as hard as possible, contesting every ball, putting a little
something extra in every slide tackle and barking a little louder
after each confrontation in a match for Major League Soccer's Western
Conference title.</LD>
<LD>   But Carlos Ruiz killed the Earthquakes softly Saturday with the
most supple shot, a pooch of a penalty kick that he lobbed over the
head of hard-charging San Jose goalkeeper Joe Cannon in the fourth
minute of injury time.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz's league-leading 24th goal of the season not only gave the
Galaxy a thrilling 1-0 victory over the defending league champion
Earthquakes, it also gave the Galaxy the No. 1 seed and home-field
advantage throughout the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   The Galaxy (16-9-3) will open the playoffs Wednesday night at the
Rose Bowl at 7:30 against an opponent determined by today's season
game between the Columbus Crew and Chicago Fire.</TE>
<TE>   A Columbus victory means the Galaxy will play the New York/New
Jersey MetroStars. A victory by Chicago means the Galaxy will play
the Kansas City Wizards. A tie will match the Galaxy against Chicago.
Ruiz's ninth game-winning goal of the season was set up when Cobi
Jones was taken down in the penalty box by Eddie Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a total team effort," Ruiz said. "I think tonight we
showed that this team is ready for big things, that we're ready to go
to the finals."</TE>
<TE>   After the goal, a somewhat subdued Ruiz did not remove his jersey
to display his homemade T-shirt which professes his love for his
native Guatemala, a custom he has taken on after scoring. Instead, he
jogged slowly behind the net and met with fans before conducting an
impromptu interview with a Spanish-language cameraman in the stands.</TE>
<TE>   "Carlos told me earlier that a lot of goalkeepers go early on
PKs," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said. "So it made sense to just put it
in there. That's the second time he's done that.</TE>
<TE>   "In England, they'd probably call it a cheeky finish."</TE>
<TE>   In front of 26,229 fans, the fourth-largest Earthquake crowd in
Spartan Stadium history, Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman stepped up
with a huge save on a Ronnie Ekelund penalty kick.</TE>
<TE>   Alexi Lalas was called for tripping Landon Donovan in the box on a
breakaway in the 15th minute and Hartman went to his right and
blocked the shot.</TE>
<TE>   Hartman, who finished with nine saves, had another big one in the
45th minute when Wade Barrett got behind the Galaxy defense and fired
from point-blank range.</TE>
<TE>   "San Jose came out flying and is a great team and we tried to
match their intensity," Hartman said. "On that PK, by the way he
lined up, I figured he was going to go really hard.</TE>
<TE>   "I made an educated guess and thankfully he went that way."</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Galaxy midfielder Sasha Victorine was taken to San
Jose Medical Center for precautionary X-rays of his neck after he was
injured late during in a mid-air collision and taken off the field on
a stretcher.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In another MLS game:</TE>
<TE>   New England 3, New York/New Jersey 0--Wolde Harris scored two
first-half goals as the Revolution (12-14-2) secured a playoff spot
with a victory over the MetroStars (11-15-2) in front of 20,215 at
Foxboro, Mass. Taylor Twellman scored his 23rd goal of the season to

<HD>Baze Is Ablaze at Pomona</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jockey Tyler Baze was saying last week that he wished the Los Angeles
County Fair's race meet in Pomona would never end.</LD>
<LD>   After Saturday, Baze could only repeat that thought. Less than a
month shy of his 20th birthday, he won five races, including the
$100,000 stake, to move past Martin Pedroza, the perennial leader, in
the standings.</LD>
<LD>   Baze's five-bagger was climaxed by wins in the day's last three
races, the middle one a victory aboard Last Kiss, a maiden, in the
Barretts Debutante Stakes. David Flores, who had two six-win days in
1992, holds the Fairplex record.</LD>
<TE>   Pedroza, the leading Pomona rider for the last three years, rode
four winners at Fairplex on Thursday, but he had only one win
Saturday as Baze took a 16-13 lead. The 17-day meet, with eight days
to go, ends a week from today.</TE>
<TE>   The Eclipse Award winner for best national apprentice in 2000,
Baze rode nine times Saturday. His other mounts finished second,
third, fourth and fifth. He won the fifth and eighth races before
taking the 10th, 11th and 12th. Two of his winners were favorites.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish this meet would run all year long," he said the other day.
"I wouldn't have to ride against Laffit Pincay, Alex Solis and Pat
Valenzuela. When they ride, they get the favorites in every race,
while I'm trying to get the 10-1 shots to run. Here I get to ride
some of the favorites, and it's more fun."</TE>
<TE>   The top riders on the Southern California circuit generally take
off during the Pomona meet. Baze has already won five more races than
he did during the seven-week Del Mar meet that ended Sept. 11. He
finished 11th in the Del Mar standings.</TE>
<TE>   Pedroza, who has won a record 335 races at Fairplex, beat Baze by
a 29-24 margin last year.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the second time I've been second here," Baze said. "I had
to make an adjustment the first year I rode here, because this track
is three-eighths of a mile shorter than the mile tracks I'm used to
riding on."</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bill Spawr usually tosses much of his business Pincay's
way, but at Pomona he's been regularly using Baze. Pincay rode Last
Kiss twice at Del Mar, for fourth- and second-place finishes, before
Baze took over Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill told me she had been breaking slow in her first two races,"
Baze said. "He told me to just send her out of there. We got through
on the rail on the backside. I never stopped riding after that."</TE>
<TE>   Last Kiss, a $17,000 purchase at the Barretts May sale of unraced
2-year-olds at Pomona, finished 1 1/4 lengths ahead of Sky's Snow and
9-10 favorite Ionia, who dead-heated for second place. Last Kiss,
running 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:18 1/5, paid $13.80 to win.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baze's cousin, Russell Baze, had a hard-luck day in Northern
California when Dance Dreamer, the 7-10 favorite, broke poorly and
couldn't get clear in the stretch before finishing fourth in the
five-horse Bay Meadows Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Baze said Dance Dreamer would have won with a better trip. As it
was, they were beaten by about one length. David Copperfield won the
$200,000 race by a neck over Ninebanks, with Little Ghazi running
third. David Copperfield paid $7, $4.40 and $11.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Catching a weak field, Essence Of Dubai beat Walk In The Snow, a
30-1 shot, by 3 1/2 lengths in the $500,000 Super Derby at Louisiana
Downs.... At Belmont Park, Bonapaw beat Aldebaran by 2 1/2 lengths in
the $300,000 Vosburgh.</TE>

<LD>Long Beach Poly made an impact early Saturday, scoring four
touchdowns in the first 16 minutes and defeating Kahuku, 42-16, at
Aloha Stadium in Honolulu.</LD>
<LD>   The Jackrabbits (2-0) forced six turnovers against Kahuku, the
two-time defending Hawaii champions, and ended its 26-game winning
streak.</LD>
<LD>   Lorenzo Bursey and Derrick Jones led the way for Poly, ranked No.
1 by The Times. Bursey scored three touchdowns, including a
seven-yard run on Poly's first possession. Jones scored the game's
second touchdown on the final play of the first quarter, a 56-yard
reception from quarterback Leon Johnson. He later returned the
second-half kickoff 81 yards for a 35-2 lead.</LD>
<TE>   The Red Raiders (3-1), who attempted only 19 passes in three
victories this season, abandoned its running game in the second
quarter, but was unsuccessful penetrating Poly's secondary.</TE>

<TE>   It isn't surprising that Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula defeated
Palm Desert on Friday in the Palm Desert girls' golf tournament but
the 32-stroke margin of victory was an eye-opener, considering
Peninsula played without top player Annika Windon and No. 4 Mariko
Makabe.</TE>
<TE>   Windon took the day off to prepare for a PSAT test. Makabe is
undergoing therapy on a shoulder injury that could require surgery
and end her season. Still, the Panthers, ranked No. 3 by The Times,
proved they have depth by shooting 437 to defeat No. 2 Palm Desert at
the Lakes Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of surprised myself," Peninsula Coach Bob Wilton said.
"I didn't expect that."</TE>
<TE>   Helping the cause was a career-best 86 by sophomore Jane Park and
a 79 by junior transfer Collette Lowe. With Windon in the lineup last
Thursday, Peninsula shot 205 to win a nine-hole match against West
Torrance at Palos Verdes Country Club.</TE>

<DH>Duarte's Trafeh is reaping benefits of a rigorous training
schedule</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perspiration drips from his face and soaks his shirt and shorts, but
Mohamed Trafeh doesn't look or sound as if he's laboring.</LD>
<LD>   His arms pump furiously, powering his legs like pistons propelling
a car engine as he runs the foothills of Duarte during a recent
training session.</LD>
<LD>   Seven times the Duarte High junior sprints 80 meters up a steep
private road, making it up in 17 or 18 seconds and descending the
hill in a walk. Never does he seem to tire.</LD>
<TE>   And while many high school runners would struggle through such a
workout, Trafeh's breathing has nearly returned to normal in the 50
or so seconds it takes him to return to the base of the hill and
start all over again.</TE>
<TE>   "He's at a level right now where he just doesn't feel any pain,"
said Nick LaCapria, Duarte's cross-country coach. "He's just so
strong."</TE>
<TE>   Trafeh displayed that strength Saturday by winning the Division
III junior race at the Irvine Woodbridge Invitational. His winning
time of 14 minutes 51 seconds over the three-mile course was 68
seconds faster than the runner-up, Jared Zurn of Ridgecrest
Burroughs.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Trafeh's endurance comes from a base he has built the last
two summers by running as many as 100 miles a week. His commitment to
training is a big reason the native of Morocco could break the
vaunted 15-minute barrier on Mt. San Antonio College's 2.91-mile-
cross-country course this season after running 17:53 over the same
layout two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen the ambition in any high school athlete that I
see in Mohamed," LaCapria said. "He's not ever satisfied. He's always
trying to get better. You can give him a hard workout and he'll
always want to do something more."</TE>
<TE>   Trafeh ran 3,200 meters in 9:08.69 to win the Southern Section
Masters Meet in May and his 14:39.01 clocking in the 5,000 in early
June ranks sixth on the national list this year. He also finished
fifth in the state Division IV cross-country final last November.</TE>
<TE>   "I surprised myself," Trafeh said of a track season that included
a sixth-place finish in the 3,200 in the state championships in June.
"I didn't have much competition during the first part of the season
so when I got into the big races at the end, I just tried to hang
with the top guys for as long as I could."</TE>
<TE>   Trafeh, who moved to the United States with his parents from
Casablanca in the summer of 1999, has some lofty goals.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to win Division IV titles in the Southern Section and
state cross-country championships and advance to the national
championships in San Diego in December by finishing in the top eight
at the West region championships at Mt. SAC a week earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Trafeh placed 97th in the West region championships last year, but
he's come a long way since.</TE>
<TE>   He cut 44 seconds off his best in the 3,200 during track season
and is running substantially faster in workouts than he was a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him the other day that he's way ahead of where he was a
year ago," Duarte assistant coach Gil Gomez said. "Way ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Trafeh rarely ran for more than 20 minutes at a time during his
first cross-country season as a freshman, but the easy-going,
5-foot-10, 130-pounder increased his training to about 50 miles a
week during spring break last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I just decided I wanted to get better," Trafeh said. "And I knew
I had to run more if I wanted to do that."</TE>
<TE>   The improved training helped Trafeh win the 3,200 in the Montview
League track finals as a freshman and lower his best to 9:52.98 in
the section Division III preliminaries. He then ran 1,200 miles
during the summer of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We came up with this mileage mania program," LaCapria said. "We
figured we'd try to motivate the kids to train more by keeping track
of their mileage, but no one could keep up with Mohamed. He'd run in
the morning. He'd run in the afternoon. I think he even had some days
when he ran three times."</TE>
<TE>   Many coaches say it's unwise for a high school runner to log 100
miles in a week because it increases the chances of injury and mental
burnout. But LaCapria and Gomez say Trafeh hasn't been injured since
his freshman cross-country season and Trafeh said his weekly mileage
rarely tops 60 during the season.</TE>
<TE>   "We watch him pretty closely," Gomez said. "And we haven't seen
any indications that he can't handle the mileage."</TE>
<TE>   Although Trafeh hails from a nation that is a world power in
distance running, he grew up playing soccer.</TE>
<TE>   He knew that Hicham El Guerrouj, the world-record holder in the
1,500 meters, mile and 2,000 meters, was regarded as a national
treasure in Morocco. But he didn't know Duarte had a cross-country
team until he saw a friend running around the track at practice one
day.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the team a few days later but did not have instant
success.</TE>
<TE>   In his first competition, he ran 19:46 over a three-mile course to
finish third in a freshman race of the Colton Invitational. But
LaCapria and Gomez liked the fact that Trafeh would always wear his
uniform underneath his clothes during the first three or four weeks
of school and ask if the team had a meet that day.</TE>
<TE>   "I think some of that happened because he didn't understand
English real well at the time," LaCapria said. "I don't think he
understood exactly when we were racing. But I also think it showed
how excited he was about running."</TE>
<TE>   That enthusiasm has only grown. Trafeh says the only time he gets
bored on runs is on occasions when he's really hurting at the end of
a long workout.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, he enjoys the solitude--he usually trains alone--and
challenge of pushing himself on training runs that measure as much as
17 miles and take him to the top of local mountain peaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I usually think about splits I'm trying to run or about an
upcoming race," Trafeh said about one of the runs that winds through
a canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "And I'm always looking around because there are mountain lions
and bears up there. I'm never bored."</TE>

<LD>Juniors Michael Haddan of Irvine Woodbridge and Liza Pasciuto of
Murrieta Valley had the top individual boys' and girls' times in the
Woodbridge Invitational cross-country meet on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Haddan, defending state champion in the 800 meters, outkicked
Babey Wagnew of La Mesa Helix to win the Division II junior boys'
race with a 14-minute 25-second clocking over the flat three-mile
course.</LD>
<LD>   Haddan defeated Wagnew by three seconds and moved to second on the
all-time course list behind a 14:20 clocking by Agoura's Ryan Wilson
in 1992.</LD>
<TE>   Pasciuto won the Division I girls' race for the second consecutive
year to lead Murrieta Valley to a 66-91 victory over runner-up
Fountain Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Pasciuto timed 17:31 to edge senior Bethany Nickless of Fountain
Valley by two seconds.</TE>

<LD>Two old pros, trainers Charlie Treece and Blane Schvaneveldt, will
saddle two old rivals in tonight's $12,850 allowance at 350 yards in
the eighth race--Panther Mountain and Mi Gamboling Bug, both in the
twilight of their careers.</LD>
<LD>   The eighth has several others with good credentials, one of them
Winner Wants Cash, a multiple stakes finalist who finished fourth in
the Golden State Derby.</LD>
<LD>   The picks: 1. Im A Pritzi Boy. 2. Frolic's Flash. 3. Shagin Dash.
4. Bacbac Overthewall. 5. Snowy Substance. 6. Absolutely Yours. 7.
Corona Del Cielo. 8. Panther Mountain. 9. Watch This Injun.</LD>
<TE>   Late four: Absolutely Yours is after his third Arabian win in a
row in the sixth. Use Corona Del Cielo and Red Hot Blitzer in the
seventh, Panther Mountain, Winner Wants Cash and Mi Gamboling Bug in
the eighth, and Watch This Injun and Nasty Grin in the ninth. Total
cost: $12.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: In the first, Royal Snow Bunny lagged in her
last outing but finished in the money twice before. In the ninth,
Vels Silent Charger breaks from Post 9.</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Five-time driver's champion Dave Villwock and 21-time owner's
champion Bernie Little moved closer to another Unlimited Hydroplane
World Championship on Saturday when Villwock, in Miss Budweiser, won
one of two heats in the San Diego Thunderboat Regatta.</LD>
<LD>   Two more four-lap heats and a five-lap final will be held today on
the 2.5-mile Bill Muncey Memorial Course in Mission Bay. All Villwock
and Little need to pop the champagne once more is for Miss Budweiser
to finish second or better in one of today's three races, even if
Nate Brown, in Miss Elam Plus, won everything else and Miss Budweiser
failed to finish its other races.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday's heat win was worth 40 points and Villwock needs only 29
to clinch the title in the six-race series. Villwock has won three
previous races and Brown two.</LD>
<TE>   Brown, who is defending champion, tried to pressure Miss
Budweiser, but after Villwock led off the starting line, there was
little doubt which three-ton boat would win as the roostertail from
Villwock's big red craft pulled easily ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Miss Budweiser's winning four-lap speed of 149.350 mph was helped
by an opening lap of 153.964 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Hanson, driving Sunharbor Mortgage, the only other driver
with a mathematical chance of winning the championship before
Saturday, fell out early when he finished dead last in the other
heat. Mike Weber, in Miss Emcor, won in 142.852 mph.</TE>
<TE>   A Villwock-Little win would be nothing new for San Diego
hydroplane fans. Little's boats have won 13 times here, starting with
Bill Brow in 1966. Villwock has won four of them and also won in 1992
with Coors Dry.</TE>

<LD>Despite no bogeys over 54 holes and his largest lead in two years,
Tiger Woods figures he needs one more round of good golf to capture
the American Express Championship at Thomastown, Ireland.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone else might need a lot more than that.</LD>
<LD>   Woods didn't hit the ball as crisply as he did the first two days,
but he still produced a nonchalant round of five-under-par 67 for a
19-under 197 and a five-stroke lead over Kelly and several others.</LD>
<TE>   Scott McCarron set a course record with an eight-under 64. He was
at 14-under 202.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is 29-4 when he has at least a share of the lead going into
the final round.</TE>
<TE>   The round got off to a scary start when a contract worker lost
control of his golf cart and plowed into the gallery near the first
tee as Woods was about to play. Three spectators were injured, the
worst injury being a broken ankle.</TE>

<TE>   Koch and Sorenstam were the only European winners in the four
morning alternate-shot matches. Europe, the defending champion, needs
five victories in the 12 singles matches today to reach 14 points and
retain the cup.</TE>

against the World Boxing Council when a Manhattan jury agreed that he
was cheated out of his claim to the light-heavyweight championship,
his attorney said. The WBC declared its light-heavyweight title
vacant in 1998 after then-champion Roy Jones considered becoming a
heavyweight. On March 21, 1998, Rocchigiani beat Michael Nunn for the
light-heavyweight title. But when Jones decided to return to the
division in June, he was restored as champion.</TE>

<KH>KING/DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Rare Sighting of Storr Will Be Made Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe; Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jamie Storr, all but forgotten during the Kings' stretch drive into
the playoffs last season, will make his first start of the exhibition
season today at 5 p.m. against the Mighty Ducks at Centennial Garden
in Bakersfield.</LD>
<LD>   He's expected to play again before the regular season opens Oct.
9.</LD>
<LD>   After that, who knows?</LD>
<TE>   While Felix Potvin established a club record by playing in 71
games last season, Storr made only 12 starts, posting a 9-4-3 record
and sparkling 1.90 goals-against average in 19 appearances. His start
in the season finale, a 1-0 victory over the Ducks, was his first in
23 games, only his second in 35.</TE>
<TE>   But Storr, 26, never complained. He never asked to be traded. Over
the summer, when he became a restricted free agent, he could have
held out or filed for arbitration. Instead, he quietly signed a
one-year, $1.595-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, there are times where you want to play more and times
where you feel on other teams that you could," says Storr, beginning
his ninth season with the Kings, "but I'm going to leave that up to
the Kings to make that decision. In the end, whatever's best for the
L.A. Kings is what's going to happen--not what's best for Jamie Storr
or Felix Potvin."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray says he plans to use Storr more often this
season, "but we reserve the right to do what fits the situation."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, it could be more of the same for the backup, who
knows that the Kings have held preliminary talks with Potvin about a
contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When individual tickets went on sale Saturday, the Kings sold out
their first three games--against Phoenix, Detroit and Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who's No. 1 is a given, as goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere will
handle 60-65 games this season for the Mighty Ducks. The competition
to be the backup has begun.</TE>
<TE>   Ilja Bryzgalov, J.F. Damphousse and Martin Gerber are also being
considered. Gerber stopped all 18 shots he saw against Minnesota on
Friday and started in goal for the Ducks at Phoenix on Saturday. The
Ducks won, 4-2.</TE>
<TE>   Bryzgalov and Damphousse will play tonight, when the Ducks and
Kings play in Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' prefer the 22-year-old Bryzgalov play a lot and will
probably have him spend another season at minor league Cincinnati.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's beginning to look as though the San Francisco Giants' stretch
run will wind up a success.</LD>
<LD>   Kenny Lofton and Rich Aurilia hit consecutive seventh-inning
homers, and the Giants kept up their strong play Saturday night with
a 3-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at Milwaukee.</LD>
<LD>   It was Lofton's third homer and Aurilia's 15th.</LD>
<TE>   San Francisco has a two-game lead over the Dodgers in the National
League wild-card race. The Giants, who trail NL West-leading Arizona
by 5 1/2 games with seven to play, have won 11 of 16.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Schmidt (12-8) gave up three hits in seven innings, struck
out eight and walked three. Tim Worrell pitched a hitless eighth, and
Robb Nen finished with a perfect ninth for his 40th save in 48
chances.</TE>
<TE>   "Robbie looked exceptionally sharp and Tim Worrell continues to
excel," San Francisco Manager Dusty Baker said. "It's not easy coming
into a 3-1 ballgame in this park, especially the way the ball's
flying out."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 15, Arizona 8--The Diamondbacks lost Brian Anderson to a
broken foot and wasted a chance to clinch a playoff berth for the
second consecutive game, blowing a five-run lead at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado went ahead in a seven-run seventh that included Juan
Pierre's tiebreaking single, his fifth hit.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson broke a bone in his left foot when he was struck by Ben
Petrick's liner in the third inning</TE>
<TE>   Houston 6, St. Louis 3--Wade Miller (15-3) tied a team record by
winning his 12th consecutive decision, and Lance Berkman hit a
two-run homer and drove in three runs for the Astros at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, unbeaten in 15 starts since a June 26 loss to Arizona,
tied the team record set by Mark Portugal in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 6, Atlanta 4--Eric Owens hit a tiebreaking triple in a
five-run, sixth-inning rally at Atlanta, and Brad Penny (8-6) beat
the Braves for the third time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Millwood (17-8) took a 3-0 lead and a two-hit shutout into
the sixth, when he gave up four of the Marlins' seven consecutive
hits.</TE>
<TE>   New York 6, Montreal 3--Esix Snead hit a three-run homer in the
bottom of the 11th inning, ending Montreal's seven-game winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Mo Vaughn hit his 25th homer for the Mets, who tied it in the
ninth on first baseman Andres Galarraga's two-out throwing error.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 4, Pittsburgh 2--Sammy Sosa barely missed his 499th career
homer and 49th this season with a go-ahead, two-run single off the
right-field wall as the Cubs rallied with three runs in the top of
the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 5-5, Cincinnati 3-4--Barry Larkin's two errors in the
10th helped Philadelphia win the opener of a day-night doubleheader,
and Tomas Perez's 11th-inning homer against Joey Hamilton (4-10)
finished the sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Adams (7-9) won both games and Jose Mesa saved both, tying
Mitch Williams' club record with 43 saves.</TE>

<HD>Notre Dame a Late Bloomer</HD>
<DH>Nonconference: Battle's 60-yard touchdown with 1:15 left
gives unbeaten Irish a 21-17 victory over Michigan State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST LANSING, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Notre Dame doesn't prefer winning in such dramatic fashion. It's only
working out that way.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Pat Dillingham, playing for injured starter Carlyle
Holiday, threw a short pass to Arnaz Battle, who turned it into a
60-yard touchdown with 1:15 left as the 12th-ranked Fighting Irish
rallied to defeat Michigan State, 21-17, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "If we win every game like this, I know it creates a little more
heartache for a lot of people, but I'll take 13 like that," Notre
Dame Coach Tyrone Willingham said.</LD>
<TE>   Notre Dame (4-0) is off to its best start since 1993, the last
time it seriously challenged for the national championship.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference is, we used to lose games like this," said Battle,
a senior wide receiver who has also played quarterback at Notre Dame.
"Now we're finding a way to win games like this."</TE>
<TE>   In defeating the Spartans (2-2) for the first time since 1994, the
Irish gave Willingham a sweet victory against his alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   "Michigan State is a huge part of me, but I'm the coach of Notre
Dame," Willingham said. "That doesn't mean I don't have feelings for
Michigan State. I just didn't for 60 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State had defeated the Irish the last five years and
appeared to be headed for a sixth consecutive victory after receiver
Charles Rogers scored his second touchdown, which came with 1:45 left
on a fourth-and-11 play and capped a 97-yard drive. Rogers made the
touchdown reception by leaping in the back of the end zone--with two
defenders on him--and stabbing his left foot down just inside the end
line.</TE>
<TE>   On the ensuing possession, Dillingham--who came into the game late
in the third quarter after Holiday suffered an injury to his left
shoulder--threw a short pass on a crossing pattern to Battle. As
defenders were running into each other, Battle raced to the sideline
for the deciding score.</TE>
<TE>   The last three times Michigan State had defeated Notre Dame, the
Spartans needed fourth-quarter touchdown passes to win. Michigan
State got the ball back with 1:09 left, but its comeback hopes ended
when quarterback Jeff Smoker scrambled and threw a 43-yard pass that
was intercepted by Gerome Sapp at the Notre Dame three.</TE>

(5-0) spread its offense to open up running lanes.</LD>
<TE>   Bollinger completed 13 of 19 passes for 127 yards and one
touchdown. He also ran for one touchdown to improve to 27-7 as a
starter, tying a school record before giving way to backup Jim Sorgi.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona (2-1) looked nothing like a team with the country's
second-best passing attack. Quarterback Jason Johnson struggled
against the Badger pass rush, and his receivers dropped several
passes. He completed 13 of 27 passes for 129 yards and was
intercepted once before being yanked after the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Last week against Utah, Johnson threw for 416 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The only bright spot on offense for Arizona was Clarence Farmer.
Last year's Pacific 10 Conference rushing leader struggled in
Arizona's first two games, but on Saturday he ran for 131 yards,
including a 70-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The Badgers blew open the game with a second quarter that featured
a solid running game, efficient passing, and waiting for the opponent
to make mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was held to successive career lows of 81, 75 and 49 yards
the previous three games. But he had 104 yards by halftime, including
touchdown runs of six and three yards.</TE>
<TE>   Bollinger set up the first TD by passing to Jonathan Orr for a
25-yard gain that put the Badgers in position for Davis' six-yard
touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   On Arizona's next possession, Wisconsin's Alex Lewis blocked a
punt, setting up Davis' three-yard touchdown run for a 14-0 Wisconsin
lead.</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 Oregon 41, Portland State 0--Onterrio Smith rushed for 115
yards and two touchdowns and Jason Fife had two touchdown passes as
the Ducks (4-0) defeated the Division I-AA Vikings (2-1) at Eugene,
Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Smith scored on runs of 25 and three yards and became the first
Oregon player to gain at least 100 yards in the first four games of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 Washington 38, Wyoming 7--Cody Pickett threw for 404 yards
and two touchdowns as the Huskies won at Seattle to hand the Cowboys
(0-4) their school-record 12th consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Pickett completed 34 of 45 passes without an interception and also
scored on a one-yard run in the first quarter for Washington (2-1).</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 Washington State 45, Montana State 28--Jermaine Green's big
day was dampened by an injury to Cougar quarterback Jason Gesser.</TE>
<TE>   Green, a little-used reserve who battled a knee injury in fall
practice, ran for two touchdowns and caught another as the Cougars
(3-1) defeated the Division I-AA Bobcats (2-2) at Pullman, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser left the game in the third quarter with Washington State
ahead, 31-7, after getting injured on a sack. He was taken to a
hospital for X-rays, which revealed dislocated cartilage in a rib.</TE>

<LD>Where have we heard this one before?</LD>
<LD>   Old USC quarterback, longtime journeyman, long presumed retired,
refuses to hang them up, instead just hangs around and hangs in there
until desperate NFL team breaks emergency glass, summons him back
into action in his dotage and gets surprisingly successful results,
to the amazement of all.</LD>
<LD>   Old Rodney Peete, the new Carolina Panther savior, has been a nice
story for a couple of weeks, but it's certainly not a new one.</LD>
<TE>   Original blueprint for this tale: Vince Evans.</TE>
<TE>   A tale of the tattered tape:</TE>
<TE>   AT USC</TE>
<TE>   Evans: Three-year letterman, 1974-1976.</TE>
<TE>   Peete: Four-year letterman, 1985-1988.</TE>
<TE>   SENIOR SEASON</TE>
<TE>   Evans: Captained Trojans along with Ricky Bell and Eric Williams
to a 10-1 record and the Pacific 8 Conference championship.</TE>
<TE>   Peete: Captained Trojans to a 10-1 record and the Pacific 10
championship.</TE>
<TE>   TROJAN FINALE</TE>
<TE>   Evans: Started at quarterback against Michigan in the Rose Bowl.
Rushed for a touchdown. Won, 14-6.</TE>
<TE>   Peete: Started at quarterback against Michigan in the Rose Bowl.
Rushed for two touchdowns. Built a 14-3 lead. Lost, 22-14.</TE>
<TE>   NFL DRAFT</TE>
<TE>   Evans: Selected in the sixth round by longtime NFC Central
also-ran Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Peete: Selected in the sixth round by longtime NFC Central
also-ran Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   ROOKIE SEASON</TE>
<TE>   Evans: Spent all of it backing up Bob Avellini.</TE>
<TE>   Peete: Spent half of it backing up Bob Gagliano.</TE>
<TE>   FIRST SEASON AS PRIMARY STARTER</TE>
<TE>   Evans: Appeared in 13 games for 1980 Bears. Completed 148 of 278
passes for 2,039 yards, 53%. Team finished 7-9.</TE>
<TE>   Peete: Appeared in 11 games for 1990 Lions. Completed 142 of 271
passes for 1,974 yards, 52.4%. Team finished 6-10.</TE>
<TE>   SCRAMBLING MAN</TE>
<TE>   Evans: Did lots of running behind those shaky Bear offensive
lines. Career rushing totals: 1,129 yards in 212 carries, 5.3
average, 14 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Peete: Did lots of running behind those shaky Lion offensive
lines. Career rushing totals before 2002: 1,126 yards in 247 carries,
4.6 average, 16 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   RAMBLING MAN</TE>
<TE>   Evans: Played for four professional teams: Chicago Bears, Denver
Gold (USFL), Chicago Blitz (USFL), Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   Peete: Has played for six professional teams: Detroit Lions,
Dallas Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles, Washington Redskins, Oakland
Raiders, Carolina Panthers.</TE>
<TE>   WILDERNESS YEARS</TE>
<TE>   Evans: Out of the NFL from 1984-86, bouncing around the USFL.</TE>
<TE>   Peete: Presumed out of the NFL from 1999-2001, making four
appearances, throwing 17 passes.</TE>
<TE>   NFL SEASONS SPENT WITHOUT THROWING A SINGLE PASS</TE>
<TE>   Evans: Two. Chicago 1977, Los Angeles Raiders 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Peete: Two. Oakland 2000, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   VETERAN, GRIZZLED</TE>
<TE>   Evans: In 1995, at 40, threw for 335 yards and two touchdowns in a
30-17 Raider victory over Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Peete: In 2002, at 36, threw for 310 yards and a touchdown in a
31-7 Panther victory over Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   RETIRED</TE>
<TE>   Evans: Finally, after the 1995 season, at 40 years 6 months.</TE>
<TE>   Peete: Not yet. As the league was shocked to discover two weeks
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Say It Ain't So, Joey</TE>
<TE>   It has been 30 years since Detroit put a quarterback in the Pro
Bowl, going on 31. Two questions: How did that happen? And does Joey
Harrington know what he's getting into?</TE>
<TE>   Greg Landry: Passed for 2,237 yards in his one Pro Bowl season,
1971. Never matched that figure again until after his 1979 trade to
the Baltimore Colts.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Munson: Made 10 appearances in '73, 11 in '74. Did not pass
for more than nine touchdowns in either season.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Reed: Third-stringer forced into '75 lineup when Landry and
Munson were both injured in the same game.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Danielson: Spent eight seasons (1976-84) in Detroit, much of
it rehabbing injuries. Threw for 3,076 yards in '84; Lions went
4-11-1.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Komlo: Starter by default after Danielson blew out his knee
in final '79 exhibition. Threw 23 interceptions, Lions finished 2-14.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Hipple: Quarterbacked '83 Lions to division title and
first-round playoff defeat. Injury wiped out '87 season.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Ferguson: One of three quarterbacks Lions used in 1986. Lions
opened season 1-7, blaming the fans' booing for their sluggish start.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Long: Heisman Trophy runner-up in '85, first-round pick in
'86, was out of Detroit after '89, having thrown 19 touchdowns and 28
interceptions in parts of four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Hilger: Raider reject threw 306 passes for '88 Lions (4-12).</TE>
<TE>   Bob Gagliano: Detroit was third of four stops in seven-year NFL
career. Passed for 16 touchdowns, 22 interceptions in 1989-90.</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Peete: Spent five seasons (1989-93) in Detroit, never
passed for 2,000 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Ware: '89 Heisman winner did a quick run-and-shoot right out
of Detroit, appearing in only 14 games in four NFL seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Kramer: Quarterbacked Lions to first, and only, playoff
victory since Bobby Layne, in '91. It was all downhill and off to
Chicago in '94 after that.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Mitchell: Lions spent $11 million for this: four full
seasons, one second-place finish, two third-place finishes, two
first-round playoff defeats. The glory days.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Krieg: Krieg was a 36-year-old safety valve for Mitchell by
the time he arrived in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Batch: Replaced Mitchell in '98. Did OK handing the ball
off until Barry Sanders retired.</TE>
<TE>   Ty Detmer: Lions' Heisman jinx continues. Threw seven
interceptions against Cleveland in his first start in 2001.
Amazingly, was permitted to make another.</TE>
<TE>   Mike McMahon: Rutgers rookie briefly a hero in Detroit for beating
Vikings in December 2001 and saving 0-12 Lions from a winless season.
Then the 2002 season began.</TE>
<TE>   Joey Harrington: Congratulations, rook. It's all yours.</TE>

<HD>This Is No Easy Ryder</HD>
<DH>Golf: Playing for your country is a lot more difficult than
for someone else's money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>Mark Calcavecchia sat in the sand, head in his hand and tears
streaming down his face. Certain that he had just blown the 1991
Ryder Cup for the American team, he just wanted to be alone on the
beach at Kiawah Island.</LD>
<LD>   Later that afternoon, it was Bernhard Langer's turn. He sobbed in
the locker room after missing a five-footer against Hale Irwin that
would have allowed Europe to keep the cup.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans were the ones who ended up celebrating after winning
the raucous "War By The Shore." Emotions, though, were plenty raw on
both sides after the gut-wrenching finish.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no way I would ever wish what happened on that last hole
to anyone," Irwin said.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in a Ryder Cup means standing up to pressures that can
cause meltdowns on the course, and breakdowns off of it. Players
whose heartbeats barely go up when there's a $1 million purse at
stake suddenly find their legs turning to jelly over the prospect of
a three-footer with national pride on the line.</TE>
<TE>   That promises to be no different at The Belfry, where the crowds
won't always applaud for the right reasons and where the definition
of success and failure depends on which side of the ocean a
14-inch-tall gold chalice ends up.</TE>
<TE>   There's no real money involved, beyond expenses and a few dollars
for charity. But players live with the constant reminder that their
country and 11 other teammates are depending on them, something of a
foreign concept in the week-to-week life of a tour player.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a fear of losing, rather than a nervousness about
trying to win a U.S. Open or a Masters or a PGA," Davis Love III
said. "You don't think about, 'I don't want to lose. I don't want to
finish second.' It's more, 'What can I do to win this thing?' In the
Ryder Cup, you don't want to lose a match. You don't want to lose a
hole. You don't want to be on a losing team."</TE>
<TE>   It's those kind of thoughts that can make players look more at
times like Jean Van de Velde playing the 18th hole in the British
Open than 24 of the best golfers in the world.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Calcavecchia stood on the 15th tee four-up, only to
collapse in an oceanful of bad shots that gave Colin Montgomerie a
tie at Kiawah Island. If Langer had made his putt and Europe kept the
cup, Calcavecchia would have long been vilified for losing the Ryder
Cup on home soil.</TE>
<TE>   That was the fate of this year's captain, Curtis Strange, who won
two U.S. Opens but can't escape the scars from the 1995 Ryder Cup
when he was three up with four to play, only to lose the deciding
match to Nick Faldo.</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. team sat in stunned silence during the awards
ceremony, Strange buried his brow in his hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll deserve what I get in the press over the next few days,"
Strange said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't just the press.</TE>
<TE>   "Bogey, bogey, bogey ... Ryder Cup choker," mocked a fan at a
tournament a few months later.</TE>
<TE>   Strange was an experienced Ryder Cup player by then, accustomed to
the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   David Duval wasn't in 1999 when he and Phil Mickelson teed off in
an alternate shot match on Thursday in his first Ryder Cup. Behind
his wraparound sunglasses, he was shaking.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil hit first, and he hit in the rough," Duval said. "If I had
hit first, it would have been worse."</TE>
<TE>   Darren Clarke had the same feeling in 1997 when he stood on the
first tee at Valderamma.</TE>
<TE>   "I teed it up a little bit higher than usual to make sure I made
contact on the way down," Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Tiger Woods--whose Ryder Cup record is a not-so-Tigerlike
3-6-1--isn't immune. After his first Ryder Cup match in 1997 at
Valderamma, Woods told his then-coach Butch Harmon he had never been
so nervous in his life.</TE>
<TE>   Jesper Parnevik says he loves every moment. Of course, no one has
ever accused Parnevik of living in the same world as his fellow
players.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care who wins. It's the atmosphere I like," Parnevik
said. "Just the fact guys are pumping their fists and screaming and
jumping on the first hole Friday morning, that's what makes it
special. You never see a guy do it out here, ever. Maybe on the last
hole Sunday when they have a chance to win.</TE>
<TE>   "There, every hole is like playing a major to win."</TE>

<LD>Eli Manning threw for a career-high 386 yards and two touchdowns, and
Ronald McClendon's 23-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter
sealed Mississippi's 45-38 victory over Vanderbilt on Saturday at
Oxford, Miss.</LD>
<LD>   Ole Miss (3-1, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) defeated Vanderbilt
(1-3, 0-2) for the ninth time in the last 10 meetings but blew a
38-17 fourth-quarter lead.</LD>
<LD>   Kwane Doster and Norval McKenzie each ran for more than 100 yards
to lead the Commodores, who scored touchdowns on three consecutive
possessions to tie the score at 38-38 with 6:51 left on a three-yard
run by Matthew Tant.</LD>
<TE>   The Rebels answered, marching to the Commodores' 23, with Manning
completing all five of his passes on the drive. On second down,
McClendon took a handoff up the middle, spun away from a tackler at
the line and raced in for a touchdown to put Ole Miss up, 45-38, with
3:12 left.</TE>
<TE>   Manning finished 24 for 41 and extended his streak of games with a
touchdown pass to 16.</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Georgia 45, Northwestern State 7--David Greene tied a school
record with four touchdown passes and the Bulldogs finally showed
some offense, defeating the Division I-AA Demons at Athens, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia (3-0) raced to a 31-0 halftime lead against outmanned
Northwestern State (3-1), which bused in from Louisiana to save money
and held out its best player, safety Terrence McGee, to save him for
the conference schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Greene, who averaged only 118 yards passing in the first two
games, completed 26 of 43 for 346 yards, including two touchdowns to
Terrence Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   The Demons made a two-day bus trip from Natchitoches, La., because
the school wanted to save its travel budget for a charter flight
later in the season to meet conference foe Jacksonville State.</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina 42, Temple 21--Corey Jenkins threw two touchdown
passes and ran for two other scores as the Gamecocks (2-2) defeated
the Owls (1-3) at Columbia, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins completed 18 of 23 passes for 198 yards, and South
Carolina (2-2) solved its turnover problem. After giving the ball
away 12 times in their first three games, the Gamecocks had only one
against Temple.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama 20, Southern Mississippi 7--Shaud Williams rushed for 135
yards and Ahmaad Galloway had 89 yards rushing and a touchdown as the
Crimson Tide (3-1) defeated the Golden Eagles (3-1) at Tuscaloosa,
Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky 44, Middle Tennessee 22--Jared Lorenzen threw for 305
yards and three touchdowns to lead the Wildcats over the Blue Raiders
(0-3) at Lexington, Ky., for their first 4-0 start since 1984.</TE>

<LD>Wes Scott has an innovative idea to improve the tackling skills of
high school football players: Let them try steer wrestling.</LD>
<LD>   It has worked well for Scott, a 17-year-old senior defensive end
at Canyon Country Canyon High who learned to pull down calves long
before ever tackling a quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   He's a real cowboy playing for the Canyon Cowboys. He finished
second in the state rodeo steer wrestling competition this summer. He
lives on a 10-acre ranch in Canyon Country and comes to school
wearing a cowboy hat, belt buckle and boots.</LD>
<TE>   He's so proficient in handling a lasso that it's surprising
Canyon's principal hasn't offered him a job as a security guard.</TE>
<TE>   "People will be walking by and he'll rope their left foot or right
foot," Canyon Coach Harry Welch said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott, 6 feet and 190 pounds, is used to tackling steers that
weigh between 300 and 500 pounds, so chasing a quarterback is no big
deal.</TE>
<TE>   "They both fight back quite a bit," Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   In steer wrestling, the steer is let loose and Scott chases after
it on a horse, with another rider, known as a hazer, adjacent to him.
Scott slides off his horse, grabs the steer's horn with one arm,
holds it down and twists the steer's nose to cause it to fall to the
ground. Everything is supposed to happen in less than 10 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "With a steer, it's more of a technique thing," he said. "If you
don't have any technique, it will get away every time."</TE>
<TE>   During the 1980s, Canyon had one of the Southern Section's most
successful football programs. Welch's coaching record was 120-31-2
from 1982-93, including consecutive section titles from 1983-85. He
returned for a second stint of coaching last season, hoping to return
the Cowboys to their glory days. Players with the commitment and work
ethic of Scott are the ones who could help trigger a turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   Scott had two tackles for losses in Canyon's 24-10 season-opening
victory over Lancaster. The Cowboys are 2-0 after beating Saddleback,
48-0, on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Scott truly believes in the cowboy culture. It's as if he were
born in a different era, when a handshake meant as much as a written
contract and a person's word was gospel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the cowboy way to respect people and help them out if they
need it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott takes care of horses, goats, cows, chickens, cats and dogs
at his parents' ranch, which also has a roping ring. His father is a
stunt coordinator for movies and let Scott begin to wrestle calves
when he was 8.</TE>
<TE>   Scott loves to watch westerns on television. He has seen the movie
"Tombstone" so many times he can close his eyes and imagine he's
living in the time of Wyatt Earp.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always wished I was born back then so I could ride with the
guns and chase down the outlaws," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He's a teenager who doesn't mind sharing space with horseflies and
rattlesnakes and isn't bothered by rope burns.</TE>
<TE>   "I just like being different from everyone else, wearing my cowboy
hat and people recognizing me as a cowboy," he said. "Everyone thinks
it's cool. Everyone wants to talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   Welch might want to examine the high school football rule book to
see if it's legal for a player to use a lasso during a game because
Scott would be unstoppable with his 30-foot rope.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be over," Scott said. "I'd be roping everyone."</TE>

<LD>Tyrone Willingham called the event "significant," and not only
because Notre Dame used a late touchdown to defeat Michigan State,
21-17, and end a five-game losing streak to the Spartans.</LD>
<LD>   Willingham was referring to the rare occurrence of two
African-American coaches squaring off in a Division I-A football
game. His counterpart, Bobby Williams of Michigan State, said the
encounter shows progress.</LD>
<LD>   "You see how much college football has changed to have this game
broadcast nationwide, to look around at all these kids seeing two
black coaches on the sidelines and saying, 'Hey, maybe I can do that
someday,' " Williams said.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Willingham said, coaching opportunities for
minorities remain few and far between.</TE>
<TE>   "[Saturday's game] also points to a shortcoming in our system, and
that is disappointing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham and Williams represent half of major college football's
black head coaches. San Jose State's Fitz Hill and New Mexico State's
Tony Samuel are the only others among 117 Division I-A programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Black Coaches Assn. hopes the game will bring attention to the
absence of minorities in head coaching positions.</TE>
<TE>   "On the positive, I am very pleased and ecstatic we can take a
moment to recognize the outstanding accomplishments of coaches
Williams and Willingham in an event that [represents] two of the
higher-echelon football programs in the country," said Floyd Keith,
the association's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   "On the downside, I would hope that the message is clear that we
wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't have a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Players Get the Shaft</TE>
<TE>   Bowling Green quarterback Josh Harris and running back Joe Alls
learned a valuable lesson Saturday. Never share an elevator with the
team's linemen.</TE>
<TE>   Harris and Alls were among 22 Falcon players who were stuck for 20
minutes in a hotel elevator that exceeded its weight limit before
Bowling Green's 39-16 victory over host Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   The players got stuck about noon--a few hours before kickoff--at
the Marriott Hotel in Overland, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   "That was hectic," said Alls, who rushed for a career-high 161
yards. "I heard Coach [Urban] Meyer up there saying, 'Whatever you're
doing, it's not working.' "</TE>
<TE>   Most of the players were linemen, who brought the total weight
over the elevator's limit of 3,500 pounds. The elevator got stuck
between the first and second floors.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't breathe and then I started sweating because I'm
claustrophobic," Alls said. "All of a sudden, it stopped."</TE>
<TE>   After about 20 minutes, a maintenance worker used an override key
to get the elevator back to the second floor. The players then took
the stairs.</TE>
<TE>   "We were going up to the fourth floor and we made it to about one
and a half and it dropped," said linebacker Mitch Hewitt, who
recovered a Kansas fumble for a touchdown. "I remember looking at
[offensive lineman] Greg Kupke and his eyes were about to pop out of
his head."</TE>
<TE>   Not Quite the Big Time</TE>
<TE>   Big Ten Conference teams absorbed some big hits and escaped with
two close calls Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati nearly upset sixth-ranked Ohio State, but Bearcat
receivers dropped two potential touchdown passes in the last minute
before Will Allen intercepted a tipped pass in the end zone to secure
the Buckeyes' 23-19 victory at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 Michigan also needed a last-minute interception, the second
of the game by Julius Curry, to turn back Utah, 10-7, at Ann Arbor,
Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Purdue and Illinois each suffered embarrassing losses
at home.</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest capitalized on five Purdue turnovers (four fumbles and
an interception) to defeat the Boilermakers, 24-21. The Demon Deacons
scored 17 points off turnovers, sending Purdue Coach Joe Tiller to
only his second loss in 23 home games against unranked opponents
since he took over in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois' defense was a sieve against San Jose State, which got
408 yards passing from Scott Rislov, four touchdown runs by 5-foot-5
tailback Lamar Ferguson and drove the field in the last 1 minute 21
seconds to set up a 37-yard, game-winning field goal by Nick Gilliam
on the last play.</TE>
<TE>   Restoring the Lions' Roar</TE>
<TE>   Penn State is back, and tailback Larry Johnson is leading the
revival.</TE>
<TE>   After three years of being lost in the mix of running backs,
Johnson continued to assert himself by rushing for 147 yards and two
touchdowns and scoring a third touchdown on a reception to help the
No. 15 Nittany Lions pound Louisiana Tech, 49-17, at State College,
Pa.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like we never tackled before," Louisiana Tech
linebacker Curtis Randall said. "[Johnson] was running hard. We were
making him look like he should be in the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson most resembled an NFL back in third quarter, when he broke
five tackles on a 39-yard run, bowling over one defender and throwing
another to the ground before being forced out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry Johnson had a heck of a game, broke a lot of tackles,"
Coach Joe Paterno said. "That means a lot." It was Paterno's 330th
career victory, extending his record for major college coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Getting Carried Away</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky's best start in 18 years apparently has gone to the heads
of Wildcat fans.</TE>
<TE>   After Kentucky defeated Middle Tennessee, 44-22, a raucous crowd
chanted, "Beat the Gators," referring to the Wildcats' Southeastern
Conference opener next weekend at No. 10 Florida. Talk about wishful
thinking.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcat faithful were feeling giddy after the victory gave
Kentucky its first 4-0 start since 1984. Jared Lorenzen led the way
by passing for 305 yards and three touchdowns. There would probably
be talk among fans of a bowl appearance, except that Kentucky is
banned from playing in a bowl this season because of NCAA violations.</TE>
<TE>   Devouring Another Cupcake</TE>
<TE>   It's a good thing Oregon didn't put up any billboards depicting
its nonconference schedule. That would have been one ugly duckling.</TE>
<TE>   The ninth-ranked Ducks beat up on Division I-AA Portland State,
41-0, to improve to 4-0. Their first three victories were against
Mississippi State, Fresno State and Idaho, teams with a combined
record of 2-8.</TE>
<TE>   After playing four games in Eugene, the Ducks have a bye this week
before opening Pacific 10 Conference play at Arizona on Oct. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries Sideline Standouts</TE>
<TE>   In a tongue-in-cheek response to Oregon's billboard campaign,
Washington State placed the likeness of Cougar quarterback Jason
Gesser on the side of a grain silo last summer.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Cougars weren't laughing when Gesser left Saturday's
game against Montana State in the third quarter after injuring his
ribs and the shoulder on his right (throwing) arm. X-rays revealed
dislocated cartilage in a rib but no shoulder damage.</TE>
<TE>   At Atlanta, tailback Tony Hollings was helping Georgia Tech run
out the clock in its 28-19 victory over Brigham Young when his knee
gave way on his 36th carry. Hollings, who rushed for 189 yards and
three touchdowns, left the field on a cart. He is scheduled to have
an MRI on Monday. Hollings entered the game leading the nation in
scoring and ranked fifth in rushing.</TE>
<TE>   Catch of the Day</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State's Charles Rogers, who had two touchdown receptions
against Notre Dame, tied an NCAA record by catching a touchdown pass
in his 12th consecutive regular-season game. He shares the mark with
Marshall's Randy Moss, Michigan's Desmond Howard and Pacific's Aaron
Turner.</TE>

<LD>Brian Lindgren threw for 382 yards and six touchdowns Saturday as
Idaho defeated San Diego State, 48-38.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego State's Adam Hall completed 29 of 49 passes for 506

incompletions, first-year San Diego State Coach Tom Craft went for it
on fourth down instead of trying a field goal.</LD>
<TE>   Hall threw incomplete, and the Vandals took over.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State's J.R. Tolver, the nation's leading receiver, had

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The members of the Robert Hodge fan club could have met in a closet
last week.</LD>
<LD>   Make room for company.</LD>
<LD>   Hodge, the Colorado quarterback who had such a disastrous debut
against USC, walked off the Rose Bowl field a winner against UCLA on
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   But before he could reach the tunnel, some buddies from Manhattan
Beach Mira Costa High hailed him from the front row, kissing his head
when he reached the stands.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew you could do it," they told him.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew he'd come through," said Mustafa Pourtemour, 21, a former
Mira Costa teammate.</TE>
<TE>   That's saying something, because Hodge--pressed into action
because of a career-threatening concussion suffered by starter Craig
Ochs--completed only one of nine passes in a 40-3 loss to the Trojans
in which Colorado gained a mere 61 yards.</TE>
<TE>   You could see Hodge's confidence grow against the Bruins, from
shaky beginnings to those quick rollouts in the second half--and
particularly on the two-point conversion pass in the third quarter
that looked crucial then but proved to be no issue in Colorado's
31-17 runaway.</TE>
<TE>   Hodge completed 11 of 22 passes for 117 yards, and provided just
enough of a threat as a passer and runner to open up the run for
Chris Brown, who rushed for 188 yards and three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how we knew he could play," said Vince Carino, 22, another
high school teammate of Hodge. "He was a little shy last week and
unsure of himself. He's a good player. He was a good player in high
school and a good player at El Camino [College]."</TE>
<TE>   Hodge isn't just another local guy USC and UCLA didn't recruit.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody recruited him out of high school.</TE>
<TE>   But after a standout career at El Camino, he landed at Colorado,
playing mostly on special teams last season and attempting only three
passes, completing one.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's Colorado's starter indefinitely--and he and the Buffaloes
might have turned around what was becoming a disastrous start.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, it wasn't a pretty game for me, but we got it done,"
Hodge said.</TE>
<TE>   Well put.</TE>
<TE>   "The education of Robert Hodge?" Colorado Coach Gary Barnett said.
"There's always a big difference between your first game and your
second game.</TE>
<TE>   "I challenged Robert that his grace period was over and he now
needed to be a quarterback in this league and be the guy that when he
stepped in the huddle, everybody needed to do what he told them to
do. He made some plays out there and got his confidence and everybody
got confidence in him."</TE>
<TE>   Hodge was on the other end of one of the biggest pass plays of the
game, when he threw a lateral to Barry Kunkel in the third quarter
and Kunkel passed the ball back to Hodge, who made a nifty move for a
29-yard gain to the UCLA 12.</TE>
<TE>   That set up the touchdown and two-point conversion that gave
Colorado a 21-7 lead--the moment it started to look as if Colorado
would win.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to give Robert Hodge a lot of credit, because for a
while it looked like he was going to play the way he did last week,"
Barnett said. "He just picked his game up."</TE>
<TE>   Hodge completed only one of six passes in the first quarter and
was sacked twice, but after that he began to find his way.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people doubted him," center Wayne Lucier said. "The
receivers made some plays, and they gave him confidence. He did great
from the second quarter on."</TE>
<TE>   For Hodge, it couldn't have happened at a better time. Or a better
place.</TE>

<HD>Beavers Gain Revenge in Rout</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CORVALLIS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Steven Jackson helped Oregon State get payback for its embarrassing
loss to Fresno State last year, running for 227 yards and two
touchdowns to help the Beavers to a 59-19 victory on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Derek Anderson had 214 yards passing and three touchdowns for the
Beavers (4-0), who were defeated by the Bulldogs, 44-24, last year in
Fresno, starting a slide to a 5-6 season.</LD>
<LD>   The Beavers had three interceptions, giving them a nation-best 11.
Oregon State returned two of the interceptions for touchdowns.</LD>
<TE>   The Bulldogs (1-3) got four first-half field goals from Asen
Asparuhov, including a career-best 52-yarder, but little else as the
Beavers charged to a 31-12 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State extended the lead to 59-12 before backup Paul Pinegar
passed three yards to Stephen Spanch for a Bulldog score late in the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs were without touted receiver Bernard Berrian, who
sprained his knee in the opener against Wisconsin and hasn't played
since.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs were coming off a bye. They had been 5-0 under Coach
Pat Hill after byes.</TE>

<DL>MANHATTAN, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Kareem Kelly, USC's senior receiver, caught only three passes for 42
yards Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   And even though one of those catches resulted in a fumble that led
to Kansas State's first touchdown, Kelly seemed surprised by the lack
of work.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just me and Newman all night long," he said, referring to
the one-on-one coverage of Wildcat cornerback Terence Newman. "If I
was taken out of the game, it was nothing they did to me. I was just
playing within our system. I did what I was asked. My number was just
not called today."</LD>
<TE>   Kelly's fumble occurred on a catch that gave him a USC record for
consecutive games with a catch (38).</TE>
<TE>   Keary Colbert led the team with a career-high 11 catches for 125
yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sultan McCullough, who entered the game averaging 4.8 yards a
carry, continued to play as if he wants more action, as he averaged
6.6 yards a carry with one touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   He carried the ball only 11 times, and is averaging about 15
carries per game.</TE>
<TE>   ""We gave it a fight," McCullough said. "We were one play away."</TE>
<TE>   McCullough, a senior, was unafraid to cite the six dropped passes
that led to the loss.</TE>
<TE>   "There were mental mistakes," he said. "You've got to win your
individual battle. A lot of people were dropping the ball and stuff
like that. They were easy catches and they weren't catching them.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just drop it, especially when you really need it to be
able to keep the momentum going."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The number and victims on Carson Palmer's record-setting night:</TE>
<TE>   * With 8,608 passing yards, he passes Rob Johnson to become USC's
leader.</TE>
<TE>   * With 681 completions, he passes Johnson to become USC's leader.</TE>
<TE>   * With 1,404 combined runs and passes, he passes Rodney Peete to
become USC's leader.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior cornerback Ronald Nunn left the game because of a knee
injury with 6:45 left in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt sophomore William Buchanon replaced Nunn, who will
undergo an MRI exam on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC shuffled its offensive line several times throughout the game.</TE>
<TE>   Zach Wilson started at right guard and freshman Winston Justice
started at right tackle, but they were replaced in the second quarter
by freshman guard Fred Matua and junior tackle Eric Torres.</TE>
<TE>   Torres replaced Jacob Rogers at left tackle for the first series
of the second half, but Rogers went the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore nose tackle Mike Patterson scored the Trojans' first
touchdown after safety Troy Polamalu stripped the ball from Kansas
State quarterback Ell Roberson at the Wildcats' three-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson picked up the ball on a bounce and rambled into the end
zone to make the score 10-6.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the ball and there were so many things going through my
mind, I didn't know what to do at first," Patterson said. "I was
going to fall on it, but then instinct just kind of took over and I
ran it in."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State is 1-4 against ranked nonconference opponents. The
Wildcats are 5-14-1 against Pacific 10 Conference schools, but they
have defeated three Pac-10 opponents in a row--Washington in 1999 and
USC the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After getting one carry against Colorado last week, tailback
Justin Fargas rushed for 24 yards in six carries.... In one of the
more unusual pregame ceremonies, riders of 118 Harley Davidson
motorcycles rode their bikes around the field before the teams came
out of their locker rooms.</TE>

<LD>It was supposed to be a showcase for two of the nation's top
quarterbacks, but freshman tailback T.A. McLendon of North Carolina
State grabbed the spotlight from teammate Phillip Rivers and Texas
Tech's Kliff Kingsbury.</LD>
<LD>   McLendon, an explosive runner who set several national records at
Albemarle (N.C.) High, tied a North Carolina State record with five
rushing touchdowns. His last one, from eight yards, gave the Wolfpack
a 51-48 overtime victory and its first 5-0 start since 1991.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-2, 220-pound McLendon had 150 yards in 32 carries, with
all five of his scoring runs coming from inside the 10. He tied the
school's single-game touchdown record, set in 1972 by Stan Fritts
against Wake Forest.</LD>
<TE>   "We thought he was pretty good, but he played better than we
probably thought he might," Texas Tech Coach Mike Leach said.</TE>
<TE>   Big scoring games are nothing new for McLendon. While leading
Albemarle to the North Carolina I-A title last season, he set a
national high school record with 71 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   As for the quarterbacks, Rivers passed for 301 yards and no
touchdowns, and Kingsbury threw for 273 yards and three touchdowns
and engineered four fourth-quarter touchdown drives that allowed
Texas Tech to rally from a 38-10 deficit and tie the score, 45-45.</TE>

<HD>Eyes on Victory</HD>
<DH>Looking to Sunday's Emmys, an intrepid columnist ponders
the nominees and selects those he thinks are golden.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The annual prime-time Emmys return Sunday with none of the allure,
glamour and mystique of the Oscars and Grammys. But with all the
pomp.</LD>
<LD>   No stargazing. Ignore stretch limos dropping celebrity-loads at
the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles in front of paparazzi, and the
groupies shouting from afar. Forget the empty red-carpet chatter, the
borrowed gowns, the implanted breasts, the cosmic hair, the tweaked
faces, the leased smiles, the stunning spontaneity of rehearsed
ad-libs. Stay focused on what really counts. Only one thing should
matter to you now.</LD>
<LD>   My unique insights.</LD>
<TE>   What am I, stone? Would I be doing this if not for a public
groundswell demanding that I disclose my own choices in advance of
Sunday's telecast on NBC? These are not predictions, merely a wish
list.</TE>
<TE>   So here it is, on a page that is not only suitable for framing,
but has the added advantage of fitting nicely in the bottom of a
birdcage.</TE>
<TE>   As always, there is this disclaimer: In an act of integrity
amazing even to me, these Emmy picks are confined to shows that I
have actually seen.</TE>
<TE>   Whoa!</TE>
<TE>   First, some striking omissions. Fox's "The Bernie Mac Show" and
Showtime's "The Chris Isaak Show" deserved the comedy nominations
they didn't get, and the latter show's Kristin Datillo the supporting
mention she was denied.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Livingston and Neal McDonough were snubbed despite memorable
supporting work as World War II combat officers in HBO's "Band of
Brothers." And most boggling of all is the absence of Ryan Gosling,
miraculously good as the Jewish neo-Nazi in Showtime's "The
Believer." Emmy voters just didn't get it.</TE>
<TE>   Now, my picks:</TE>
<TE>   Drama Series: Four of five nominees are CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation," NBC's "Law &amp; Order," perennial winner "The West
Wing," and Fox's "24," which roared from the gate impressively but
ended its first season on an empty tank.</TE>
<TE>   Bury 'em. My choice: Groundbreaking "Six Feet Under," a complex,
sneaky funny, highly original HBO series about a mortuary family. It
enters with 23 nominations. And no wonder, for its scripts, direction
and performances are as stunning as anything on TV since, well, HBO's
"The Sopranos," whose production schedule took it out of the running
this year.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, HBO's overall Emmys supremacy surely will build in 2003,
when "The Sopranos" again becomes eligible, joining contender "Six
Feet Under" and HBO's superb new cop series, "The Wire." To say
nothing of its cheeky comedy, "Sex and the City."</TE>
<TE>   Lead Actor, Drama Series: Scratch Kiefer Sutherland of "24,"
Michael Chiklis of FX's "The Shield" and even Martin Sheen, though he
remains strong as the Prez in "The West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   Topping this field, instead, are Peter Krause and Michael C. Hall,
splendid as the brotherly protagonists on "Six Feet Under." I can't
choose between them.</TE>
<TE>   Lead Actress, Drama Series: Amy Brenneman of CBS' "Judging Amy"
and Jennifer Garner of ABC's "Alias"? Very nice. Allison Janney of
"The West Wing"? Even better.</TE>
<TE>   But enough of them. Aussie Rachel Griffiths and Frances Conroy had
seasons of transcendence on "Six Feet Under," the former as the
brilliant but wacky girlfriend of Krause's character, the latter as
the funeral home's tightly wound matriarch. No choosing between them
either.</TE>
<TE>   Supporting Actor, Drama Series: Victor Garber is mentioned for
"Alias," Freddy Rodriguez for "Six Feet Under" and Dule Hill for "The
West Wing," a series notable for its acting depth. Affirming that are
"The West Wing's" strongest nominees in this category, Richard
Schiff, Bradley Whitford and John Spencer. After two coin flips,
Spencer's chief of staff wins.</TE>
<TE>   Supporting Actress, Dra-ma Series: No close call here, despite
Mary-Louise Parker and Janel Moloney of "The West Wing," and
especially Stockard Channing from that series and Tyne Daly from
"Judging Amy."</TE>
<TE>   Gifted young Lauren Ambrose earns the award for her troubled teen
on "Six Feet Under."</TE>
<TE>   Comedy Series: One reason Emmys are so tedious is that the same
names show up year after year. Except for HBO's "Curb Your
Enthusiasm," the field here consists of same old same-olds: "Sex and
the City," NBC's "Friends" and "Will &amp; Grace," and CBS' "Everybody
Loves Raymond." Although "Sex" and "Raymond" are world-class, I'm
flipping coins again and going with Larry David's "Curb" if only
because its episode titled "The Doll" was last season's funniest
half-hour on the planet.</TE>
<TE>   Lead Actor, Comedy: Nominees are Bernie Mac of "The Bernie Mac
Show," Kelsey Grammer of "Frasier," Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry of
"Friends," and my choice, Ray Romano of "Raymond."</TE>
<TE>   Lead Actress, Comedy: From "Friends" comes Jennifer Aniston, from
"Raymond" Patricia Heaton, from "Will &amp; Grace" Debra Messing, from
"Sex and the City" Sarah Jessica Parker. Nice crowd. But I've
anointed amazing Jane Kaczmarek of Fox's "Malcolm in the Middle."</TE>
<TE>   Supporting Actor, Comedy: My pick is Kaczmarek's "Malcolm"
husband, Bryan Cranston, over Brad Garrett of "Raymond," Sean Hayes
of "Will &amp; Grace" and David Hyde Pierce of "Frasier," if only because
he's the least celebrated of this group.</TE>
<TE>   Supporting Actress, Comedy: Another coin flip gives it to
wonderful Doris Roberts of "Raymond" over Cynthia Nixon of "Sex and
the City," whose work gets better and better. Other nominees are Kim
Cattrall of "Sex and the City," Megan Mullally of "Will &amp; Grace" and
Wendie Malick of NBC's "Just Shoot Me."</TE>
<TE>   Movie: TNT's "James Dean" was a dud, HBO's "Dinner With Friends"
so-so. Vastly better were HBO's "The Laramie Project" and "The
Gathering Storm" and, my choice, its "Path to War."</TE>
<TE>   Miniseries: Three of the four nominees are ABC's "Dinotopia,"
TNT's "The Mists of Avalon" and A&amp;E's "Shackleton." In other words,
if "Band of Brothers" doesn't win, Emmy voters should be checked for
lobotomy scars.</TE>
<TE>   "The 54th Annual Emmy Awards" can be seen Sunday at 8 p.m. on NBC.</TE>
