<LD>"That's so Sarah Jessica," a woman exclaimed, picking up a
treacherous-looking spiky metal handbag at David Keeps' Shop Chuey
gallery in Chinatown Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   "As if it was an adjective," said Keeps, with a grin.</LD>
<LD>   The party was for Niagara, a Detroit-based pop artist whose show
includes paintings, silk screens, T-shirts, purses, martini glasses,
towels and other products. (Keeps thinks Niagara could become a "rock
'n' roll Martha Stewart.")</LD>
<TE>   Niagara, in black leggings, big hair and painted-on
lashes--Morticia Addams meets Nico--stood in the middle of the room,
surrounded by an adoring crowd. "Thank you for coming to L.A.,"
gushed 32-year-old Jon Halperin. His companion, Taraneh Pezeshk, 20,
asked Niagara to sign a little ceramic ashtray she'd just bought. "I
was so excited when I heard she was coming," Pezeshk said. She turned
to Niagara. "I love that," she said, pointing to a crowd favorite, a
print of a gun-toting woman with the inscription "Geisha This."</TE>
<TE>   A girl in a "Free Winona" T-shirt admired a dress with the text,
"I'm not that L.A." while nearby, a couple paused in front of a glass
box containing a metal handbag decorated with a syringe behind a
clear panel. (The other side of the purse said: "Break in case of
emergency.") "Isn't this something?" a man exclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   When a reporter talked to some guests, Niagara interrupted: "Hey!
This story is about me," before walking outside to talk to artist
Mike Kelley. (The two were bandmates in "Destroy All Monsters," a
proto-punk mid-'70s band. Niagara sang, Kelley drummed.) "The band
was really an art thing," Kelley said. " 'cause we were so
good-looking. A human trash pile."</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good name for a band," replied Niagara as the DJ began
playing their old music. "This is us; we sound plenty good," Kelley
said.</TE>
<TE>   Designer Monah Li stopped by to say hi. Actor Josh Leonard and
artist Kenny Scharf mingled in the crowd. Keeps gave his verdict on
the turnout: "Ghouls and hipsters."</TE>
<TE>   Drawing a Crowd</TE>
<TE>   "I'm big with grandmas," said John McEnroe, sitting at the back of
Book Soup on Sunset Boulevard. The 43-year-old McEnroe was hawking
his biography, "You Cannot Be Serious," and Saturday, about 50 people
had lined up to catch a glimpse of everyone's favorite middle-aged
bad boy.</TE>
<TE>   A local high-school tennis coach was in awe. "There'll never be
another John McEnroe," he sighed. A 40-ish unathletic-looking woman
asked McEnroe to sign the book, "From one great tennis player to
another." (He did. And graciously.)</TE>
<TE>   He mentioned that a couple of older women had driven all the way
from Fresno just to see him. "That's my biggest support group--women
in their 70s."</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe said he had taken a hard look at himself while writing
with collaborator James Kaplan. "It's not a fluffy type of portrayal,
but warts and all, the bad and the ugly," he said. "It's not about
how great I am."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone already knows that.</TE>
<TE>   John DiCrosta, 39, a fan for 27 years, complimented the tennis pro
on the choice of cover for the book--a 1984 Nike ad with McEnroe as
James Dean. "He was the rebel with a cause," DiCrosta said, as he
stood on the sidewalk clutching his autographed copy. "If he was
whining, he always had the game to back it up." After 45 minutes, the
crowd was thinning. But McEnroe would not give up: "Another one. I
have a good feeling there's going to be another one." Sure enough, a
man walked by and McEnroe persuaded him to buy a copy. "See, this is
what happens when you persevere," he said. "It's like a fifth set of
tennis."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "You get to a point where you're crying yourself to sleep at
night.... I feel like I'm in the middle of a soap opera. I honestly
know what it's like to have a broken heart now."--'N Sync's Justin
Timberlake in the June 24 issue of People magazine on his breakup
with Britney Spears.</TE>

<LD>CLASS ACTION</LD>
<LD>   The Story of Lois Jenson and the Landmark Case That Changed</LD>
<LD>   Sexual Harassment Law</LD>
<TE>   By Clara Bingham</TE>
<TE>   and Laura Leedy Gansler</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday</TE>
<TE>   390 pages, $27.50</TE>
<TE>   Imagine working in an iron mine in northern Minnesota. You're a
single mother, 27 years old, on welfare. The only way you see to
support yourself and your young son is by taking a mine job, which
pays nearly three times what you might earn in any other employment
available to women and offers health insurance. You are among the
first four women hired to work in the mine--a result of affirmative
action--and although the labor is backbreaking, you can do it.</TE>
<TE>   What you hadn't counted on when you took the job in 1975 was the
hostile work environment you'd be entering, where men resented women
miners--women belonged at home, was the male rallying cry, not
stealing men's jobs. The men were ruthless in their angry, crude form
of harassment: groping the female miners, threatening them, posting
sexually explicit drawings in the workplace, yelling obscenities,
stalking.</TE>
<TE>   "Class Action" is the tightly written, extensively researched and
well-plotted account of the first sexual harassment class action
suit, started by Lois Jenson, who walked naively into Eveleth Mines
and one of the ugliest job environments imaginable, an environment
the mining company refused to clean up until it was forced to take
action nearly 25 years later. By then, Jenson had been joined by a
handful of other female miners, making up the class that sued and
eventually settled the case, and in the process, established crucial
legal precedent. But the ordeal also cost her: Jenson's physical and
mental health deteriorated to an alarming degree.</TE>
<TE>   Co-written by Clara Bingham, a journalist, and Laura Leedy
Gansler, a lawyer versed in dispute resolution, "Class Action"
combines potent narrative tension with copious research and legal
information. Piecing together the ordeal with the pacing of a novel,
they engage the reader from the outset; we are outraged by the
behavior of particular men and incredulous that the mining company
could consistently turn a blind eye, certain that a resolution must
be on the horizon and then unbelieving that something so evident
could take so long to rectify. Finally, reader and miners are beaten
down by a legal system that allows victims to be re-victimized in
court. The writing is never didactic. The human interest element
keeps readers fascinated and turning pages to see how, when--and
sometimes if--the abuse would end.</TE>
<TE>   Fascinating, as well, is the book's exploration into the history
of sexual harassment law and affirmative action. It was not until
1976 that the courts recognized sexual harassment as a form of sex
discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which
"prohibits employers from discriminating against workers on the basis
of race, religion, color, national origin or sex."</TE>
<TE>   That bill, though, was originally aimed at fighting discrimination
against African Americans and did not initially include gender as a
category for potential discrimination. It was added only when Howard
Smith, a congressional leader of the Southern conservatives who'd
opposed the bill, "tacked on what he disparagingly called the 'sex'
amendment, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex." The
Virginia congressman "assumed that making employment discrimination
against women a federal violation would be so unpopular that it would
sink the bill."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, he miscalculated, but the fact that gender discrimination
wasn't even part of the original antidiscrimination act is a telling
detail.</TE>
<TE>   The authors' use of this kind of eye-opening background places
Jenson's struggle in a historically accurate light and gives readers
an understanding of the heroism behind the protection workers receive
today.</TE>
<TE>   Although the harassment the women faced in the workplace was
clearly egregious, the most abusive situation presented in the book
is that of our legal system and the damage it wreaked upon the
plaintiffs' personal lives as they fought for their rights. The
judges of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, upon overturning an
earlier ruling in the case, made this ironic statement on the
miscarriage of justice: "If our goal is to persuade the American
people to utilize our courts as little as possible, we have furthered
that objective in this case."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, a twisted sort of justice was carried out. On the
verge of a jury trial, an out-of-court settlement was reached in
December 1997 and the women were paid amounts averaging $233,000.</TE>
<TE>   By the time it was all over, the mining company and its insurers
had spent more than $15 million in a losing effort to defend their
right to maintain a hostile work environment.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it wasn't really justice. "We never got a chance to set the
record straight," Jenson said afterward, a sentiment echoed by
another plaintiff. "We just wanted to be believed."</TE>
<TE>   This book, with its day-by-day recapitulation of what the women
endured, is that opportunity: Finally, they're given the chance to be
heard and believed.</TE>

<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seated behind a long table in a book-lined room at Dutton's Brentwood
Bookstore, Stephen L. Carter looks as if he has merely paused between
late afternoon classes.</LD>
<LD>   In a sense, he has.</LD>
<LD>   In navy blazer over khaki trousers and comfortable brown oxfords,
the Yale law professor, essayist and now novelist is sorting out the
unexpected turns of his new life. But, he assures, he will return to
the old routines as soon as circumstance allows.</LD>
<TE>   Until it's time for that next class, this man, worth an advance of
$4.2 million from Knopf for his freshman fiction efforts, dutifully
makes the rounds. Southern California is the most recent stop on his
publisher's itinerary. Over the weekend, he wound his way through
many a Thomas Bros. Guide quadrant--Beverly Hills, North Hollywood,
Pasadena, Brentwood, San Bernardino--primed to talk about his new
book, "The Emperor of Ocean Park."</TE>
<TE>   Known widely as a commentator whose politics are as conservative
as the brass buttons on his blazer, Carter, 47, with just a fringe of
gray edging his goatee, has written a piece of fiction of major
proportions, both literally and stylistically. At 657 pages, "The
Emperor of Ocean Park" is a sprawling event. Both thriller and thorny
family history, it traverses the not-so-dissimilar worlds of
old-money African American society in Washington and on Martha's
Vineyard, and the drama and ambitions within an Ivy League law
school.</TE>
<TE>   Three thousand miles away from the thick of it, Carter settles
into a chair before an audience of a couple dozen or so book
collectors, journalists, historians, students and lawyers. Among them
are representatives from, as his protagonist Talcott Garland would
term it, both the "paler and darker nations."</TE>
<TE>   Preparing to read, Carter flips open a gleaming pocket watch and
places it next to his book and a slim brown leather journal. "This
has been a heady experience," he says, thumbing toward his place.
"With the kinds of books I write, I'm used to six people coming to my
readings. And that includes the staff--well, at least a person to
lock up." It's clear that Carter has just begun to sort through "just
how a novelist is supposed to behave."</TE>
<TE>   Word of Carter's big book has been blazing through the book
trades, Washington, the film world and African American list serves
for more than a year. Says one post on the Afrofuturism list:
"Whatever you might think of bruh man's politics, this cat has
written one hell of a debut novel. Deft chess metaphor/meditation of
the trials of middle-age/ academic satire/riff on the ways of the
afrostocracy. Devoured the whole thing last weekend."</TE>
<TE>   As the story opens, Talcott, an African American professor at a
prestigious law school, is thrown off balance by the sudden death of
his father, Judge Oliver Garland. The elder Garland, a
larger-than-life conservative federal judge, quick with the
incendiary sound bite, had found his career ascending at a clip until
miscalculated political alliances worked to sink his nomination to
the U.S. Supreme Court; the same unraveled alliances very well might
have led to his death.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, moving further into the book's thick murk of family
silence and legal anglings, Carter sketches his story's trajectory
along the branches of the Garland family's tree: "Ours is an old
family, which, among people of our color, is a reference less to
social than to legal status," he reads, bending closer to the
text--liberally flagged and inked in his neat black handwriting. "Not
all of our ancestors were free, of course, but some, and the family
does not dwell on the others: we have buried that bit of historical
memory as effectively as the rest of America has buried the larger
crime."</TE>
<TE>   Many readers have wondered, as does a gentleman in the front row
with neat dreadlocks: "How close is the 'I' in the book to the 'I' of
the author?"</TE>
<TE>   Carter, furrowing his brow, leans back in his low chair, as if
pondering a tricky analogy. "The only similarity that Talcott and I
share is that we are both black. Both are married to black women. And
both teach law," he says. "Doubtless," he adds, "there is more of my
voice in Talcott's than I would like to be."</TE>
<TE>   But people often feel compelled to play sleuth, and Carter makes
it an engrossing pastime. There is crispness to the story that smells
and feels like a brand-new currency. Characters transcend the page.
And the themes and moral puzzles that Carter often explores in his
nonfiction--faith, law, race, ethics, morality--inhabit this book as
though they were characters themselves.</TE>
<TE>   But more than Beltway politics or the book's mystery
hide-and-seek, what has transfixed many readers is Carter's depiction
of the black bourgeoisie.</TE>
<TE>   Carter isn't the first to delve into these worlds. Nonfiction
snapshots emerged in sociologist Edward Franklin Frazier's critical
and controversial "Black Bourgeoisie: The Emergence of a New Middle
Class in America" (The Free Press, 1957), Lawrence Otis Graham's "Our
Kind of People: Inside America's Black Upper Class" (HarperCollins,
1999), and Shirlee and Harold Haizlip's "In the Garden of Our Dreams"
(Kodansha International, 1998). The fiction of Dorothy West and both
Trey Ellis and Erika Ellis also parted the gauzy curtains of the
debutante cotillions, secret societies and resorts of the African
American privileged. But reaction to Carter's efforts suggests that,
despite what has come before, this realm is one difficult to fix
within Americans' minds.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not sit down to 'open a window,' as some have put it, onto
the lives of the upper middle class of African America," says Carter.
"I never imagined ... that readers would find the group so
fascinating. I find that a positive sign because it suggests to me,
first, that the nation itself is willing to discover this hidden
truth, and, second, that publishers--and the rest of the media--might
try to broaden the set of black fictional characters to whom the
public is exposed."</TE>
<TE>   The Garlands are people Carter knew. Not in a day-to-day way, but
as part of the ambient social strata he came to understand as an
adult. "We weren't 'Gold Coast' but we weren't poor," he explains.
That family, those characters had long been rattling about like
insomniacs in the mind of a very busy law professor. "Some characters
for 14 years. The judge, for 20. But I never had a vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   Carter had been interested in pursuing fiction since he was a
youngster, but law took hold. A graduate of Stanford and Yale, Carter
clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, a
backroom lawyer who taught him the importance of learning how to do
business with people with whom you may not necessarily agree. "He
really believed in civility and ... the human bond."</TE>
<TE>   Making the transition from nonfiction to fiction, he tells the
group, wasn't as easy as he guessed it might be. Even with all those
characters chattering.</TE>
<TE>   "With nonfiction, I'd make an outline, and those points on an
outline are transformed into a chapter. Once you run through, you're
done. With fiction, I got rid of the outline. The characters overtook
the story."</TE>
<TE>   As the evening winds down, the room has the feel of office hours.
Carter becomes less formal one on one, inscribing the books to
detailed specifications. Asked to add his "metaphorical"
self-portrait to Dutton's big fat memory book, Carter, who has not
been at a loss for words all night, stops for a long while, staring
at the white page, his pen tip poised just above it. Finally, he
draws four boxes labeled--"Idea &amp;gt; Concept &amp;gt; Outline &amp;gt;
Uh-Oh," beneath which he writes, "My Creative Process."</TE>
<TE>   Standing, towering, above the few who remain, he smiles, taking it
all in behind his glasses' broad frames. The moment isn't lost on
him. "Thank you," he says, "for not making me lock up."</TE>

<LD>Sandpaper Shark Activity</LD>
<LD>   Most fish, including sharks, have scales. Shark scales are very
different than we might imagine. To the touch, a shark's skin feels
rough, almost like sandpaper. This rough texture is due to the tiny
teeth called "dermal denticles" that cover its surface. That's right,
sharks actually have teeth on their skin! Sharks use these denticles
as protection. In between the denticles there are pores that secrete
slime. The slime helps sharks glide more smoothly and quickly through
the water. Below is an easy and fun activity to make your own
sandpaper shark that feels like a real one. Have fun!</LD>
<LD>   Materials: shark outline, two 9-by-12-inch sheets of sandpaper,
scissors, crayons, stapler, old newspaper, hole punch, yarn, some
help from an adult.</LD>
<TE>   Step 1: Cut out the shark outline from this page.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Ask an adult to enlarge the shark outline on a copy
machine so it will be as large as the sandpaper.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Trace the shark onto the rough side of one piece of
sandpaper and the smooth side of the other (so they are mirror
images).</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Cut out the sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: Using your crayons, decorate the rough side of each
shark--be creative!</TE>
<TE>   Step 6: Put the two sharks together so the sandpaper is facing the
outside and staple them along the edges. Don't staple the sharks all
the way around; leave a 4-inch opening in the top.</TE>
<TE>   Step 7: Tear your old newspaper into strips.</TE>
<TE>   Step 8: Stuff the newspaper into the shark until it is plump, but
make sure it can still be stapled shut.</TE>
<TE>   Step 9: Staple the top closed.</TE>
<TE>   Step 10: To hang your shark as decoration, make a hole at the top
with a hole punch and attach a piece of yarn.</TE>
<TE>   Once your shark is finished, show it to your friends and family.
Make sure they touch the shark and feel its rough skin. Explain to
them that real sharks really do feel like sandpaper.</TE>
<TE>   You can see more than 150 sharks at the Aquarium of the Pacific's
new Shark Lagoon exhibit and even touch some of them. For tickets and
information, please call (562) 590-3100 or visit

<LD>Lindsay DuFresne's students at Hope View Elementary in Huntington
Beach had these suggestions and comments on teasing.</LD>
<LD>   * When I was in the second-grade, people would tease me because I
wore glasses. At recess they would throw balls at me and call me
names. I said, "You're just jealous because I can see better." The
next day they broke my glasses. (Emily, 8)</LD>
<LD>   * One time I got a haircut to my shoulders. All the kids in my
class liked it, but one boy started teasing me and calling me names.
I ignored him, but he didn't stop, so I told his teacher, and she
told him to stay away from me. (Jessica, 9)</LD>
<TE>   * One day I was taking the bus with my sister and she was crying.
The kid in front of us turned around and said, "Ooo, you're ugly when
you cry." So I said, "Bug off, meathead." (Garrick)</TE>
<TE>   * I was playing basketball and I missed a shot. Then the people on
my team called me a baby. The other team laughed at me and gave me
light punches. I was hurt a lot inside! I asked them to please stop,
but they didn't. I asked them again but they didn't stop. I went to
tell the teacher, and the problem was solved! For the next 10
minutes, I had a good recess. (Heather)</TE>
<TE>   * I have a sister, and we don't always get along. When we have
fights, we start calling each other names. When she really gets mad,
she teases me about my poor spelling. I know that I'm just as good a
speller as anyone else. I just need to take time. Now we don't start
many fights because we both know it really hurts, and I mean a lot.
(Amanda, 9)</TE>

<HD>Cooking Family Style</HD>
<DH>African American men show off their culinary skills and
support community</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Do real men cook? Of course they do. They also help with housework,
care for their kids, write poetry, bring home the bacon--and
participate in society in ways that make their parents, kids and
spouses proud. Then again, not all men do each of those good
things--or get credit for it when they do.</LD>
<LD>   That's one reason why Real Men Cook has been a successful venture
on Father's Day for the last 13 years. Taking place in 10 cities
simultaneously, the event is touted as a way for men in the African
American community to show off culinary talents along with their
devotion to family, neighborhood and charity. Part of this year's
proceeds go to the Magic Johnson Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles on Sunday, about 100 cooks and 1,000 guests showed
up on the top parking level of the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza for
the festivities. Excel Sharieff, 31, an entertainment lawyer, was
serving up his favorite macaroni and cheese recipe, with guidance
from his dad, Roy Davis, 60. Sharieff said he participates "to let
the community know there are lots of African American males that
actually support their communities and have very strong family
values."</LD>
<TE>   Lorenzo Brown, a third-year finance student at the University of
Pennsylvania, offered up his refreshing corn salad at the Alpha Kappa
Alpha booth because "I'm home for the summer and my aunt roped me
into it." George Bowman, an insurance and investment broker, served
up portions of his special recipe Louisiana baked beans along with
his business cards. For many at the event, it was a way to meet
potential customers as well as do good work.</TE>
<TE>   Anton Allen ate a lot. The proprietor of what he calls "the
biggest and best barbershop in L.A.," New Millennium Sports, also was
feeding the youngest of his four children, Croice, 1 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to show support for family," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Harold Hambrick, executive director of the Los Angeles Business
Expo and president of the Los Angeles Black Restaurant Assn.,
admitted he doesn't cook a whole lot at home--except for his
specialty, fried turkey, a favorite of his family. For the Father's
Day event, Hambrick had fried a few huge turkeys, then stood in the
booth carving and serving all afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The music and poetry of Shang and Sheon, members of the Def Poets,
entertained the crowd. Their words--about fatherhood and family--were
as nourishing as anything else on the menu.</TE>

<HD>A War Story Set to Music</HD>

<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What could be new about the plight of Europe's Jewish children at the
start of World War II? The horrors they endured have been cataloged,
explained, assessed, discussed. It is an episode one might believe
has been wrung dry of any possible fresh illumination. But, as with
any great saga of the human spirit, new insights are as numerous as
the artists willing to explore them.</LD>
<LD>   Mona Golabek, author and concert pianist, took the stage at the
Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles on a recent evening to discuss her
new book, "The Children of Willesden Lane" (Time Warner). A willowy
blond in a long black slip-like dress, she moved gracefully from
reading passages in the book to playing passages of the music she
mentions in it.</LD>
<LD>   The story is hopeful, personal. And true.</LD>
<TE>   It is a memoir of her mother, Lisa, starting when Lisa is a little
girl with two sisters in prewar Vienna. They are the daughters of a
tailor and a housewife who plays piano and loves classical music.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa soon reveals herself to be a piano prodigy, and her mother
teaches her all she knows. Not just the music, but tales of how the
composers looked and lived, where and for whom they played. Mozart,
Beethoven, Schubert and Strauss all seemed like Lisa's friends by the
time she started formal lessons with a fine instructor. Those ended
when he was forced to stop teaching her because she was Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, her father and all other Jews were prohibited from
working. Soldiers beat people in the streets, broke windows, battered
and pillaged the Jewish neighborhood. It was terrible for children to
watch, but as long as the sisters had each other and their mother's
soothing care, it all seemed bearable.</TE>
<TE>   One day the parents announced that they'd secured a single space
on the kindertransport--a train that took endangered children from
Germany and Austria to the safety of London. The oldest daughter had
just turned 18 and was ineligible. The youngest was too small, the
parents thought, to live life on her own. Lisa, the pianist, was 14,
and had her music to sustain her. She would hopefully get to England
and find a sponsor so her little sister could escape.</TE>
<TE>   Before she put Lisa on the train, her mother made her promise:
"Hold on to your music; it will help you through--let it be your best
friend." She pressed a photo of herself into Lisa's palm, and the
voyage began.</TE>
<TE>   The book chronicles Lisa's journey to the hostel for displaced
children at 243 Willesden Lane--and the lives of those traumatized
youngsters who turned the house into a haven. It was a place where
all arrived speaking German and all learned English--fast. A place
where all desperately missed their parents and siblings and had no
way to know if they were still alive. Lisa and the other "older"
children left every morning to work in factories, shops and
homes--their earnings were necessary to keep food on the table and
coal in the bin.</TE>
<TE>   It was also a place of friendship, romance and fun. And it had an
ancient upright piano.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa kept her promise to her mother, whose voice echoed constantly
in her head. She practiced every day after work, no matter how tired.
She had no teacher to help her progress in technique--but the other
kids tried to listen to her music thoughtfully and make constructive
comments. They chipped in to buy her a metronome, having decided her
playing lacked consistent timing. They helped her win a scholarship
to the Royal Academy of Music--a miracle for someone with no parents,
money or musical mentor. Even more amazing, Lisa managed to recruit a
sponsor for her younger sister, who made it out of Vienna on the last
kindertransport train.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa never saw her parents again. Both were killed. Her older
sister eventually escaped, and the three siblings migrated to
Southern California. Lisa married and had two daughters, Mona (the
author) and Renee. They are pianists like their mother and like the
grandmother they never met. Renee's four children are musicians. And
so the legacy continues, not just for them but for all who lived at
243 Willesden Lane.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Lewis, 80, of La Crescenta, was in the audience. He lived
with Lisa in the hostel and remembers their life well. "The house
became home. We had no one in the world except each other. We became
family, lifelong friends. Our parents had put us on a train, and 90%
of us never saw them or our siblings again." Lewis, a widower, says
he doesn't need to read the book, "because I lived it." But he has
gone to watch Lisa's daughters play piano "many times at the
Hollywood Bowl, once under the direction of Zubin Mehta." And now he
has seen one of them immortalize his dear friend Lisa, who died in
1998, in the new book, which was written with Lee Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Nussbaum, 79, another kindertransport child, also showed up
at the event. After the war he married, became a mechanical engineer
and settled in Brentwood. The strength of their parents' love--even
in absentia--was what powered many Willesden children to survive and
succeed, he says.</TE>
<TE>   The armed guards who inspected cars and then patted down audience
members at the start of the evening were an eerie reminder of how
things, even in this country, can change so dramatically from month
to month. Two or three years ago, people might have complained about
the long wait to get in, because of the constant alarm on the huge
metal detector that never detected anything in the audience except
metal on key rings or in eyeglasses. On this night, with a different
kind of terror in the air, not even the old and infirm minded the
intrusion." It's better to be secure," said an elderly man on a
walker, as guards waved their wands over him to be sure he wasn't
armed.</TE>
<TE>   Liebe Geft, director of cultural programs at the museum, says she
hosts two or three such programs every week. "We focus on dignity,
respect, human rights--on voices that promote tolerance," she said.
Another program the same week, for example, was a new documentary
about the 442nd regimental combat team in World War II--a battalion
of Japanese Americans. "Here were fighters for our country whose own
families were interned in camps here at home, many of whom had their
property taken away. Yet they fought for the free nations of the
world."</TE>
<TE>   The children of Willesden Lane were fighters, too, in their way.
And they won.</TE>

<HD>The Bomb Is Back</HD>
<DH>Just when we thought it was passe, the nuclear threat looms
large</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today it all seems so naive, so idealistic, a towering grand
illusion. For one brief, shining decade--a dozen years, tops--we'd
convinced ourselves that the thermonuclear shadow had receded, the
doomsday clock had been set to "snooze," the threat of planetary
suicide had vanished along with the Soviet Empire, apartheid and
other cruel relics of the 20th century.</LD>
<LD>   Even the experts among us, Foggy Bottom wonks and think-tank
philosophers, had dared to dream of a world free of the damoclean
sword of mutual assured destruction. "The simple truth is that people
simply forgot about nuclear danger for about a decade, and there were
some pretty good reasons for doing so. I had a feeling like that
myself," says Jonathan Schell, whose hair-raising tome, "The Fate of
the Earth" (Knopf, 1982 ), helped fuel the nuclear freeze movement of
the early 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   But in the bleak months since Sept. 11, the phantom menace of
nuclear catastrophe has come back with a vengeance--stalking our
imaginations, confounding our leaders, confronting us with a host of
atomic terrors hitherto barely imagined: hijacked airliners rammed
down the throats of nuclear power plants; "dirty bombs" spraying
lethal radiation and rendering huge swaths of cities uninhabitable
for years to come.</LD>
<TE>   Looming over these lesser catastrophes is the threat of an actual
nuclear weapons attack. After the lull of the '90s, we're learning to
start worrying and fear The Bomb all over again.</TE>
<TE>   Only now America must face the possibility of dealing with more
than just one or two mega-adversaries capable of sending our entire
country up in a mushroom cloud. Now we're conjuring up visions of a
suitcase bomb detonated at Times Square, a 10-kiloton dose of
megadeath delivered in a truck to downtown Los Angeles or Chicago. Or
a regional conflict, like the present one pitting India against
nuclear rival Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir territory,
escalating into global Armageddon.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, we're being confronted anew with the sublime
terror of extinction; on the other, with the banality and
ridiculousness of a threat to our lives and our civilization from
something that may be lurking in a briefcase, a pair of Hush Puppies
or, as in the new Hollywood blockbuster "The Sum of All Fears," a
cigarette-vending machine.</TE>
<TE>   That cognitive tension, some experts say, is nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something so extreme about [nuclear] weapons and their
capacity to destroy much of the world's population that has a
dimension of absurdity," says Robert Jay Lifton, a New York professor
of psychiatry and psychology and co-author of "Hiroshima in
America--A Half Century of Denial" (Avon, 1995).</TE>
<TE>   "In my view, the only relatively accurate kind of perception of
nuclear weapons is to see them in their apocalyptic dimension, in
their world-destroying dimension," Lifton continues. "So one has to
be either apocalyptic or absurd. One has to draw upon the apocalyptic
dimension of what they do, and one also has to draw on the absurdity
of us destroying our species by our own technology and our own hand."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Lifton says, America isn't the only nation to have
undergone a kind of "psychic numbing" in response to the horrors of
nuclear war. And since the twin towers fell, he believes, "we have
become more aware of nuclear danger." But while the White House is
painting a bleak picture of potential nuclear terrorism, much of the
American public seems to be treating these threats with a mixture of
fatalism, disbelief and gallows humor.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, it's business as usual for a country that has
never really sorted out its conflicted feelings about being the first
nation to unleash nuclear weapons on the world. "In a sense you could
say that America's been in denial for pretty much five decades over
this type of threat occurring," says Mick Broderick, author of
"Nuclear Movies" (McFarland &amp; Co., 1991) and a professor of media
analysis at Murdoch University in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   If many aspects of our current anxiety look familiar, there's at
least one new wrinkle: The Bush administration's assertion that a
future nuclear terrorist attack is not merely possible but virtually
guaranteed. In recent weeks, senior White House officials, including
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, have grimly asserted that an
attack on the U.S. with nukes or other weapons of mass destruction is
"inevitable," not a matter of if but of when. Last week's news that a
U.S. citizen and suspected Al Qaeda member, Abdullah al Mujahir (ne
Jose Padilla), had been apprehended while allegedly plotting a
radioactive-bomb attack, underscored the sense of looming danger.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, pop culture is holding up a mirror to our
apprehensions. The aptly named movie "The Sum of All Fears," based on
a Tom Clancy novel, fingers every conceivable plot twist that could
bring the world to the verge of nuclear annihilation: superpower
misunderstandings, neo-Nazi madmen, mercenary arms dealers. The movie
features a frightening depiction of an atomic weapon exploding in
Baltimore, killing thousands.</TE>
<TE>   Fatalism Could Be a</TE>
<TE>   Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</TE>
<TE>   Yet a number of nuclear, foreign policy and defense experts
suggest there may be a danger in the view that a terrorist attack on
the United States using weapons of mass destruction is practically a
fait accompli. Yes, they say, the threats are real, some more than
others. But to call them "inevitable" could trigger a self-fulfilling
prophecy.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not know the basis upon which anybody could say with
confidence that it's inevitable. Equally, I don't see how anybody
could say with confidence that it will never happen," says Albert
Carnesale, former U.S. delegate to the Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks, or SALT I, with the Soviet Union in the 1970s and now
chancellor of UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   What's needed at this juncture, Carnesale says, is a more
comprehensive, contextualized understanding of how nuclear peril
develops and spreads in the real world of international politics--and
how it can be prevented through negotiation and arms-control
agreements. Carnesale says he'd like to expand President Bush's
declared "war on terrorism" into a "war on weapons of mass
destruction" in general.</TE>
<TE>   Others reject the idea that any such attack would necessarily
inflict a devastating physical blow. "There are three things that are
difficult to talk about in public in America: religion, sexuality and
radiation," says Steven Koonin, provost of Caltech in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Koonin believes that an act of "radiological terrorism"--a
so-called dirty bomb--is "probably the most plausible" type of
short-term nuclear threat facing America. Relatively cheap and easy
to make, a dirty bomb consists of some type of readily obtainable
radioactive material such as Cesium-137, commonly used in heavy
industry. Attached to an explosive device, such as dynamite, and
dispersed through an explosion, a relatively small amount could make
an area uninhabitable by current standards.</TE>
<TE>   But how great a threat would there actually be to human life,
Koonin asks rhetorically. Statistically, he says, a single dose of
radiation creates a four in 10,000 lifetime risk of contracting
cancer. For the overall U.S. population, the odds of getting cancer
are one in five. "If you just live in the U.S. and drive around, your
lifetime risk of getting killed in a car crash is one in several
hundred," Koonin says. "The point is we take bigger risks in our
everyday lives."</TE>
<TE>   A Frank Look at</TE>
<TE>   Worst-Case Scenarios</TE>
<TE>   From his 14th-floor office suite in the Mid-Wilshire district,
Jonathan Parfrey has been staring into the worst-case nuclear abyss
for some time. As executive director of Physicians for Social
Responsibility-Los Angeles, Parfrey says he's "not willing to say
it's inevitable we're going to suffer an atomic explosion. It's a
possibility."</TE>
<TE>   Parfrey says his group has performed computer projections on the
likely effects of a 12.5-kiloton nuclear blast in downtown Los
Angeles. Estimates of immediate deaths are about 150,000, and 100,000
more killed from neutron and gamma radiation exposure. An additional
800,000 people would be exposed to high-level radiation in the
surrounding area. The number of local hospital beds available to
treat severe-burn victims in the event of such an attack, according
to Parfrey: 120.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been the hardest part of my job trying to get people to be
reflective on this issue and to try to find solutions without being
paranoid," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Americans' feelings about nuclear warfare have always had an
apocalyptic, deterministic undercurrent that derives from the
country's Judeo-Christian religious traditions, says professor
Broderick of Australia. Practically from the moment it was first used
against Japan, the bomb was seen by Americans as a kind of divine
gift for ending fascist tyranny and setting the world right again.</TE>
<TE>   But some Americans also recognized that, having let loose the
nuclear genie, the United States opened up the possibility of one day
becoming a nuclear victim itself. Our post-Sept. 11 fears partly
reflect these unresolved doubts, Lifton and others suggest. Even the
designation of the former World Trade Center site as "ground zero"
evokes a nuclear analogy, revealing the popular perception that the
twin towers were America's Hiroshima, as well as its Pearl Harbor
redux. Now, the nation is pondering the terrifying possibility of an
encore--an American Nagasaki.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Americans don't necessarily oppose the use of nukes against
others: During the 1991 Gulf War, for example, opinion polls showed
that a near-majority of Americans backed the use of nuclear weapons
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Our having dropped those two bombs is not commensurate with our
sense of being a decent people who refrain from harming others
whenever we can," says Lifton. "Our resistance to Hiroshima, our raw
nerve in relation to Hiroshima, impairs our capacity to take in what
nuclear weapons really do to human beings."</TE>
<TE>   Separating Nuclear</TE>
<TE>   Fact From Fiction</TE>
<TE>   From "Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response," a publication of
the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services: "Type of
Attack: Nuclear Attack--What you should do: 1) If you see the flash
take cover and get low to reduce the effect of the shockwave. If you
hear the blast or have felt the shockwave take cover to avoid debris.
2) Move away from the debris cloud. 3) If you cannot get away from
the debris cloud, cover your mouth with a folded cloth and exit the
cloud as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   From "Hiroshima," by John Hersey: "Dr. Sasaki had not looked
outside the hospital all day; the scene inside was so terrible and so
compelling that it had not occurred to him to ask any questions about
what had happened beyond the windows and doors. Ceilings and
partitions had fallen; plaster, dust, blood, and vomit were
everywhere. Patients were dying by the hundreds, but there was nobody
to carry away the corpses."</TE>
<TE>   For those who spend their lives trying to prevent nuclear war,
perception and reality can seem dangerously close, because to achieve
the unthinkable you must first imagine it. Or avoid imagining it.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Hirsch, president of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, a Los
Angeles-based nuclear watchdog organization, says there's "a
disconnect" in the nation's nuclear attitudes, including its
perception of its own vulnerability. "If you ask [Americans] in
polls, they say it is virtually certain there will be more terrorist
attacks," Hirsch says. "[But] in their hearts they believe we had
this one event and things will return to normal."</TE>
<TE>   With Al Qaeda forces regrouping in Pakistan, and many parts of the
world on yellow alert, it will be hard in the months ahead not to
envision Yeats' rough beast slouching toward Delhi, or Karachi, or
Los Angeles, to be born. But some suggest it's time to drop the
apocalyptic rhetoric, already, and get on with the endless,
indispensable (if not "inevitable") task of somehow making the world
a safer place.</TE>
<TE>   "Armageddon is something that God does," says Schell, now a Harold
Willens Peace Fellow at the Nation Institute in New York. "It is a
fulfillment of God's plan for justice and righteousness on Earth. A
nuclear war is something that man does. It's a crime. It's not the
fulfillment of anybody's plan, God's or anyone else's. And to confuse
the two, even if we were to accept the biblical idea, would be
blasphemy, in my opinion. And yet the two are confused."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Ann Payson and her husband, Rob Ulin, bought a half-century-old
red brick house in Santa Monica, they made some shrewd remodeling
decisions. From an abandoned pile of backyard junk, they salvaged
several old-style bricks, handy for mending holes in the brickwork.
They bravely cut away a plywood facade to find a fireplace replete
with stones the size of basketballs and footballs.</LD>
<LD>   One renovation challenge still stumps them, however. What do you
do with a gaping hole in the backyard that is covered only with a
tabletop-sized slab of metal and has a 15-foot metal chute funneling
into a cave the size of a swimming pool? What, in other words, do you
do with a vintage bomb shelter?</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of shelters were built in Los Angeles and the surrounding
counties in the late '50s and early '60s, when Cold War fears
prompted contractors to work fallout shelters into their designs. The
shelters, usually underground and made of concrete, were designed to
protect Americans from deadly radioactive material produced by a
nuclear explosion. And homeowners like the Paysons who buy houses
that come with the seldom-touted feature are learning that they
actually have to deal with the stark and dark structures once they
have them.</LD>
<TE>   Do you rip them up? Fill them in? Or, given the renewed threat
over fears of nuclear attack and "dirty bomb" irradiation, use them?</TE>
<TE>   "The previous owner had a patent on this fallout shelter," Payson
says. "I have mixed feelings about it."</TE>
<TE>   The previous owner was John Bower, a retired missile designer for
the U.S. military who died last year inside the shelter during an
accidental propane explosion. (Bower, who according to his son loved
"to tinker," was making some adjustments inside the underground
bunker when somehow an explosion occurred. A propane generator inside
the shelter was fed by an above-ground tank.)</TE>
<TE>   The blast, largely percussive and not incendiary, shattered
windows across the street and blew the shelter lid three houses away.
Although the blast broke every exposed window in the adjacent house,
the shelter remained intact.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a little submarine down there," Payson says. "We want
to build a garage over it, but we have to wait to hear what the city
says about it." In the meantime, she's putting up a fence to prevent
trespassing kids from lifting up the shelter's cover and going in.</TE>
<TE>   In Eagle Rock, Stephanie Brady turned her vine-covered El Canto
Drive shelter into a bar.</TE>
<TE>   "We had our millennium party down there. We thought it would be
funny with all the talk that the world is going to end. At least we'd
be safe if it did happen," says Brady, who now lives in Charlotte,
N.C., and rents out the property.</TE>
<TE>   On New Year's Eve, her husband Michael posted a bar list on the
bomb-shelter wall that included drinks like Glow in the Daiquiri, Gin
and Toxic and Urani-rum and Coke.</TE>
<TE>   "When we bought it in 1999, it was a huge selling feature for my
husband," she adds. "Going in there for the first time was like a
scene right out of an old movie. There were cobwebs everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   The Bradys want to return to Los Angeles, move back into the house
and reopen their "Bombed Shelter."</TE>
<TE>   When Gary and Louise Lorden bought their spacious hilltop home in
Pasadena and peeled cobwebs inside their own shelter, spirits also
came to mind. Not the Gin and Toxic or the ethereal kind--the wine
variety.</TE>
<TE>   The Lordens discovered that the previous owners had already
transformed the shelter into a wine cellar, and they chose to carry
on the tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not much of a wine cellar," Louise Lorden admits. "It's half
wine cellar, half storage," dug into the side of a hill to provide
easy access to a bottle of Merlot, or easy escape from impending
annihilation.</TE>
<TE>   The split-level house was built in 1962 "in the days of scary
news," Gary Lorden notes.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Lorden is a mathematics professor at Caltech and is on the
university's wine committee. "We always joke that when doomsday
comes, we can just run in there and drink wine."</TE>
<TE>   Coastal homeowners face their own dynamics in dealing with fallout
shelters.</TE>
<TE>   When Ventura couple Bruce and Susan Sinclair peered into the
shelter's darkness, their first thoughts were about the amount of
work it would take just to make it suitable for storage.</TE>
<TE>   "We did some remodeling. We trimmed the little smoke stacks coming
out of the ground, and we put a deck over the top of it," says Bruce
Sinclair about the shelter air vents. "It looks so eerie in there. If
we were ever going to use it, we'd have to do something to lighten it
up."</TE>
<TE>   The Sinclairs, who had only one child when they bought the home in
1997, now have three children.</TE>
<TE>   In that time, they've effectively buried their shelter,
transforming a symbol of fear and paranoia into the archetypal
snapshot of Southern California living. A patio deck, Jacuzzi and an
ocean view quickly eclipse any notion stirred by the shelter below
them.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, then the bombs will fall and we'll look really
stupid," Bruce Sinclair adds.</TE>
<TE>   The Sinclairs, Bradys and Lordens could all learn something about
living with fallout shelters from Brent and Renae Parker, who made
front-page news around the world when they agreed to spend their
honeymoon inside one.</TE>
<TE>   The high-school sweethearts married in 1959 and, as a publicity
stunt for Downey Savings and Loan, endured 14 days underground.</TE>
<TE>   The shelter featured on the front page of The Times on Nov. 15,
1959, is now a storage facility for dialysis equipment in Downey, on
Florence Avenue near Lakewood Boulevard. The Parkers are still
married and now live near Livermore.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can start out in a hole like that, everything else is up
from there," says Brent Parker about his marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it seems that no amount of feng shui can transform the only
room ever built according to the blueprint of a nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Geerhart, who runs a Web site devoted to fallout shelters and
is considered by many to be an expert on Cold War artifacts, has a
warning for couples buying homes with shelters.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say to those couples: Don't destroy your shelters because
we live in some disturbing times. Retrofit them to meet the new
challenge of these uncertain times," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "The fallout shelter," he adds, "is perhaps the most emblematic
architectural artifact of the Cold War."</TE>

<LD>It's just a piece of paper.</LD>
<LD>   Tell that to director Steven Spielberg, who added a bachelor of
arts to his Oscars and Emmys when he graduated last month from Cal
State Long Beach. Or to Laker star Shaquille O'Neal, who returned to
college to earn his bachelor's eight years after he left to become a
millionaire in the NBA.</LD>
<LD>   Or to the two dozen men and women who marched across a
middle-school stage in Watts last week to collect high school
diplomas long delayed.</LD>
<TE>   They didn't have to fit their classes at Jordan-Locke Community
Adult School around basketball games and directing gigs, but around
minimum-wage jobs and caring for kids. It wasn't so much about
finding time in busy schedules, but about finding purpose in lives
marked by bad breaks and bad choices.</TE>
<TE>   And though a high school diploma sure won't put them in the league
of Spielberg and Shaq, it's priceless when the currency is pride and
self-respect.</TE>
<TE>   For some, last Thursday's commencement marked the end of a
journey. Antonio Miller had been a middling student who thought he
was on track to graduate with his Locke High class in 1994. "I missed
a couple of tests." He shrugs. "Then I didn't have enough credits to
graduate."</TE>
<TE>   He found a job, did OK and tried to convince himself it didn't
matter. But not having that piece of paper "made me feel like I was
missing something," he said. "I didn't want to be a failure." It took
him six months to finish his classes and six seconds to strut across
the stage in his cap and gown, pumping his fist at friends in the
stands. He doesn't know what's next--"I just feel like I had to close
that chapter"--only that he already feels better about himself.</TE>
<TE>   For others, graduation opened a chapter. Denise Lynch has done
fine without her diploma. She held a government job for 18 years and
pushed her three sons to do well in school. But in the 23 years since
she dropped out, she never stopped dreaming of something better.
Diploma in hand, she begins classes next month at Cerritos College.
Her plan? She smiles shyly and adjusts her mortarboard. "I know it's
going to take a while," she says. "But I'd really like to become a
lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   And for all those in the class of 2002, that walk across the stage
Thursday night was a lesson in the value of second chances, and a
testament to tenacity.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me 42 years, but I made it," crowed 61-year-old Odell
Marie Baptiste Noel, as she shared cake and punch in the school
vestibule with her fellow graduates. She had to leave her Catholic
girls' school in New Orleans when she got pregnant at 17. Her five
children finished high school; now their children are graduating.
"Cracking the books again was a challenge," she said. "But when my
grandkids started getting their diplomas, I figured it was time to
get mine."</TE>
<TE>   Benita Jimenez also dropped out to have a baby when she was 17.
She's 33 now and pregnant again--with No. 5--but that didn't stop her
this time around. Already, her diploma has won her a job as a
teacher's aide. She plans to enroll in college this fall to earn her
degree and teaching credential.</TE>
<TE>   The son, now 16, whose birth derailed her first go-round, was her
motivation to get back on track. "I didn't want my son to think 'Why
didn't she finish?' " she said. "I wanted him to see his mom graduate
before he does."</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to find tales of failure in Watts, where more teenagers
drop out of school than graduate. But inside the classrooms of the
adult-ed program, stories of success abound, as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Our students have a lot of barriers--economic hardship,
child-care issues, problems with transportation, low self-esteem. A
lot of them just get stuck," said Maxine Hammond, principal of the
Jordan-Locke Community Adult School.</TE>
<TE>   The school, part of the Los Angeles Unified School District's
network of adult-ed programs, aims to get them unstuck with free high
school classes, vocational training, career guidance and referrals to
community resources for child care, financial assistance and
counseling. Classes meet days, nights and weekends--in neighborhood
schools, libraries, churches; in housing projects and community
centers, in parole offices and at drug rehab programs.</TE>
<TE>   For Sedella Carter, this year's valedictorian, that accessibility
made all the difference. She left Locke High School pregnant, 15
years ago. "Between gangbanging and ditching, I was so far behind I
wouldn't have graduated anyway," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She went back to school two years ago not because of any grand
passion or great plans, but because she noticed a class across the
street from her church, on the morning that her pastor preached that
you can't change your life by waiting for a miracle to drop from the
sky, you just have to go back and pick up where you left off.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, she became an A student, doing homework
alongside her two sons. And she stoked the dreams of countless others
with the message of her speech on commencement night:</TE>
<TE>   "It's never too late to pick up where you left off," she said.
"It's never too late to graduate."</TE>

<LD>Rachel looked at her brother.</LD>
<LD>   "Bowls?" she said. "Why would Uncle Don tell us to get those?
We've got lots of them!"</LD>
<LD>   Matt frowned. "They must be a special kind of bowls. Maybe if we
solve more of the crossword clues, we'll be able to figure it out.
Are you ready for the next clue?"</LD>
<TE>   "No," Rachel said. "I just heard the front door. Mom's home, and I
need to ask her something." And she walked out of the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "Pipe cleaners?" said her mother. "What do you need those for?"</TE>
<TE>   "A project for school," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," said her mother. "When do you need them?"</TE>
<TE>   "Today," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hmmmm," her mother said. "All right. I'll take you to the crafts
store in a little while. And while we're out, I need to get some
tomatoes at the grocery store."</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks, Mom," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   And she went back into the kitchen, sat down at the table and
picked up the pencil.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm ready for the next clue," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Good!" Matt said. "Here it is. Number 1 down. Vegetables and
fruit are delivered to grocery stores in either of these--three
words."</TE>
<TE>   "Hmmmm," Rachel said. " 'Either' means two, so 'or' is one of the
three words."</TE>
<TE>   She thought for a while. Then she said, "Matt, are there spaces
between words in crossword puzzle answers?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think so," Matt said. "Let's ask Mom."</TE>
<TE>   "No," their mother said, "there aren't any spaces between words.
The words run together. That's why a clue will often tell you how
many words are in the answer."</TE>
<TE>   Matt looked at the clues. "Uncle Don said this one has three
words."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel thought some more. Then she said, "Bananas come in a crate.
I remember seeing the produce man unpack them."</TE>
<TE>   Matt nodded. "I've watched him too," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He thought for a minute. Then he said, "Grapes come in a box."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel counted the spaces in the puzzle. The "b" in "bowls" was
three spaces from the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   She grinned. And printed the answer.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Do you know what the answer is?</TE>
<TE>   Sue Alexander's fascination with crossword puzzles stems from a
love of words. She's been known to read the dictionary for pure
enjoyment. This story will be on The Times' Web site at

<HD>Damon Versus Bernie</HD>
<DH>Television* The only major broadcast comedies that feature
successful two-parent black families will compete head to head,
upsetting Wayans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Michael Kyles and the Bernie Macs live in the town of Wednesday
Night Prime. Both families reside in large, fashionable homes and
have adorable kids. Though they dwell on separate blocks, they are
aware of each other, being the only black families in the community.</LD>
<LD>   Though all has been neighborly between them so far, the peaceful
coexistence may end this fall, when the families will be forced to
live next door to each other. Though there will not be a family feud,
the head of one of the households insists that the block is not big
enough for both of them.</LD>
<LD>   "I was shocked when I learned what was going to happen," says
Damon Wayans, who plays Michael Kyle on the 2-year-old ABC sitcom "My
Wife and Kids."</LD>
<TE>   What has Wayans upset is that Fox is moving "The Bernie Mac Show,"
which premiered last season to critical and popular acclaim, to the
Wednesday 8 p.m. slot against "My Wife and Kids." "The Bernie Mac
Show" previously performed respectably at 9 p.m. Wednesdays against
NBC's "The West Wing" and ABC's "The Drew Carey Show."</TE>
<TE>   The shift pits the only two comedies on the four major broadcast
networks featuring African American two-parent households against
each other.</TE>
<TE>   "My Wife and Kids" stars Wayans as the owner of a successful
delivery truck company who lives in the suburbs with his wife and
three kids. "The Bernie Mac Show" revolves around stand-up comedian
Mac, playing a fictionalized version of himself, living in the
suburbs with his wife and his sister's three kids, who are staying
with him while she is in rehab for drug use. Both shows and their
stars are being heavily promoted by their respective networks for
Emmy consideration.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the competition that is bothering Wayans, the primary
creative force behind his show. He says "My Wife and Kids" has more
than held its own against other formidable Fox comedies such as
"Malcolm in the Middle" and "That '70s Show."</TE>
<TE>   It has to do with diversity and responsible black images on
television. It has to do with the fact that "My Wife and Kids" and
"The Bernie Mac Show" are the first and only sitcoms about two-parent
affluent black families to achieve mainstream popularity since the
phenomenally successful "The Cosby Show" left the air almost 10 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The networks should not be playing checkers with two shows about
African American families that are working," Wayans says. "This is
about the big picture. This is not about me and Bernie. This speaks
to a responsibility that networks have, particularly when there's a
lack of diversity on prime time. It's hard enough trying to put
together one successful show with an African American family. Now
there are two. You're putting those against each other? It's divide
and conquer. Then there will be none.</TE>
<TE>   "This frustrates me as a black man with not too much to watch.
It's divide and conquer. One of these shows will fail. And we may
lose both."</TE>
<TE>   Going up against the two comedies in the fall will be "60 Minutes
II" on CBS, "Ed" on NBC, "Dawson's Creek" on the WB and "Enterprise"
on UPN.</TE>
<TE>   Preston Whitmore, Fox's senior vice president of strategic program
planning, says he believes the ABC and Fox entries in that hour can
hold their own. Moving "The Bernie Mac Show" to 8 p.m. Wednesdays is
part of the network's strategy to strengthen its lineup, not to
directly challenge "My Wife and Kids," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When we're setting our schedule, our goal is to look at our
product and come up with our strongest schedule," Whitmore said.</TE>
<TE>   But some industry insiders and others believe Wayans has a good
point.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Katherine Pinkney, senior vice president of comedy
development for Paramount Network Television, said, "It's actually a
compliment to both shows that their respective networks think they
can stand up against such tough competition and still win the time
slot.</TE>
<TE>   "It is, however, ironic that with the dearth of shows with black
casts on the Big Four networks, that the only two comedies--and, I
must add, shows with universal appeal--would have to go head to
head," she added. Unfortunately, I think both shows will suffer."</TE>
<TE>   Darnell Hunt, director of the UCLA Center for African American
Studies, echoed, "This is somewhat troubling, especially when there
are relatively few opportunities to see people of color."</TE>
<TE>   Others agree with Fox's Whitmore that both comedies will do just
fine against each other.</TE>
<TE>   "There's very little duplication between the two shows," said
Stacey Lynn Koerner, senior vice president at Initiative Media, a
media planning and buying firm. "Both of them will survive. Both of
them have established audiences and can coexist peacefully. If one of
the shows begins to suffer, the network will move it. They are
committed to these shows."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Mac is not voicing a view on the showdown, at least not
publicly. Regency Television, which produces "The Bernie Mac Show,"
and ABC are also staying quiet.</TE>
<TE>   But Wayans says he spoke to his friend and future competitor:
"He's in an awkward position. He's not thrilled about the move."</TE>
<TE>   Fox's Whitmore said the network complied Nielsen ratings research
between March 27 and May 5 and found little overlap in audiences of
the two comedies.</TE>
<TE>   According to the research, on average, only 14% of "Bernie Mac
Show" viewers ages 18 to 49 also watched "My Wife and Kids."</TE>
<TE>   The ABC show averaged 11 million viewers a week last season, while
"The Bernie Mac Show" averaged 9.5 million. But the latter was the
top-rated series among African Americans while "My Wife and Kids"
ranked fifth, according to Initiative Media. "My Wife and Kids"
ranked 54th among white viewers; "The Bernie Mac Show" was 94th.</TE>
<TE>   The Fox research also showed that between October 2001 and April
2002, viewership for "The Bernie Mac Show" was 37% African American,
while the black viewership for "My Wife and Kids" was 23%.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not being irresponsible here," Whitmore said. "We've done
our research. These are two very different shows, distinctive
comedies that will both survive in this time period. Audiences love
these shows regardless of their racial makeup."</TE>
<TE>   Show wars, of course, are nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Fox recruited its hugely popular series "The Simpsons" to
do battle with NBC's top-rated "The Cosby Show." Then-Fox
Entertainment President Peter Chernin insisted that the strategy was
not intended to topple the phenomenally successful NBC sitcom but to
help the young network get established in prime time.</TE>
<TE>   "The Simpsons" proved to be no competition for "The Cosby Show,"
and the animated series was moved to Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   Another highly publicized clash came in September 1994, when the
medical dramas "ER" and "Chicago Hope" faced off in their premieres.
Both series were set in Chicago, and both came from prominent
producers. NBC's "ER" was the clear winner. The series, which had
author Michael Crichton as one of its executive producers, trounced
David E. Kelley's "Chicago Hope" on CBS. The network soon moved
Kelley's series out of the time slot, and the drama eventually
enjoyed a six-year run.</TE>
<TE>   But the battle that Wayans points to as most similar to his
face-off with Mac was the late-night showdown in 1997 between the
urban-flavored talk-variety shows "Vibe" and "The Keenen Ivory Wayans
Show," hosted by his brother.</TE>
<TE>   The shows were compared to each other even before their debuts
because of their similarities, and insiders speculated that only one
would survive. They eventually both succumbed to mediocre ratings and
the imminent arrival of another late-night entry, "The Magic Hour,"
hosted by sports legend Magic Johnson. That series proved to be
short-lived too.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about what Keenen went through," said his brother. "At
one time, there were three black shows on late night. Now there are
none. My fear is that is what's going to happen to Bernie and I."</TE>

<CX>   Sitcom showdown--A story in Tuesday's Calendar about the coming
showdown between ABC's "My Wife and Kids" and Fox's "The Bernie Mac
Show" mistakenly identified Fox's executive vice president of
strategic program planning by the wrong last name. His name is
Preston Beckman. In addition, the story failed to note that, with
Regency Television, "The Bernie Mac Show" is also produced by 20th
Century Fox Television. Additionally, the story should have said it
is the show's respective studios, not networks, that are heavily
promoting them for Emmy Award consideration.</CX>

deduce that because John Corbett, who played her onetime fiance, has

<HD>'Spirit Dances 6' Captures Duncan's Radiance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Isadora Duncan, the spiritual mother of modern dance, liberated the
dancing body, riveted audiences and scandalized whoever couldn't keep
up a hundred years ago. But it's hard to reexperience those effects
today, after cartoonists and counterculture dance have exhausted our
eyes with freestyle images that involve skipping.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Duncan's legacy still draws those who long to see the truly
expressive dancer who can make us feel deeply and advance our
thoughts. On Saturday night at Highways in Santa Monica, in "Spirit
Dances 6: Inspired by Isadora," a few soloists did just that, while
others elaborated the legacy in interestingly idiosyncratic ways.</LD>
<LD>   The one Duncan dancer on the program was Kathryne Cassis, whose
excerpts from Duncan repertory were curtailed by a knee injury. She
resorted, not uninterestingly, to "marking" and "talking through" her
work--familiar poses were glimpsed while we heard about Duncan's
approach. Both of these elements had been masterfully introduced via
a slide presentation that started the evening (put together by
Allegra Fuller Snyder). Other soloists captured bits of Duncan's
charms--flowing simplicity from Diane Takamine; luxuriant lightness
and joyful discovery from Linda Gold. Anndrea Taylor, Gabriela Cerda
and Roberta Wolin-Manker offered glosses on Duncan's fluttering arms,
her severe drama and naive patriotism, respectively.</LD>
<TE>   But from two women who have lived a few decades longer than Duncan
herself came the evening's heart-wrenching highlights. Marion Scott,
whose elegant aging presence has enlivened previous "Spirit Dances"
(a series she conceived and directs), used simple, direct gestures to
evoke Duncan's grief after her two children drowned. She slowly, then
startlingly, slid into a believable silent scream that melted into
Schubert's mournful "Du bist die Ruh'." Fuller Snyder's solo was a
gift to anyone wondering how a dance can be like the sun's warmth and
its sudden setting. To Wagner's Prelude to Act 1 from "Lohengrin,"
she was resigned in seated stillness before painfully walking toward
a golden light and raising her arms like a supplicant, then an angry
servant with an unknown mission. She was a haiku and an epic--an
experienced, weighted body that housed a raging soul, sinking with
the dying of the light.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Over the past six weeks, Gary Goetzman has been to 30 cities, going
to a different radio station every morning. "I feel like a promotion
man working a hit record in the old days of the music business," says
Goetzman, a film producer who got his start in the '80s in the record
industry. Except now, he isn't touting a hot new single. He's
pitching "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," the year's most unlikely hit.</LD>
<LD>   Made for $5 million, spurned by its original distributor and
damned with faint praise from critics when it opened in April, the
film has been an under-the-radar industry sensation. Now on 455
screens, the movie has taken in $13.6 million so far and is on pace
to equal the success of "Memento," which brought in $25 million two
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Wherever Goetzman goes with the film's co-stars, Nia Vardalos and
John Corbett, there's an uproar. In Washington, when a female DJ
caught sight of Corbett, a regular on HBO's "Sex and the City," she
flashed her breasts. In Atlanta, the radio station's secretarial pool
emptied out, with everyone lining up to pose for pictures with the
stars.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't have the money to do exit polls, but it's a pretty good
sign when you're out in a restaurant and you hear people talking
about the movie," says Goetzman, who produced the film with Tom Hanks
and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, who initially saw Vardalos do the
material as a one-woman play in Los Angeles. "In every market we've
gone to, the movie takes off. It's like throwing a match on
gasoline."</TE>
<TE>   "Greek Wedding" offers a textbook example of how to nurture an
underdog movie at a time when most multiplexes are crowded with
prints of "Star Wars" and "Spider-Man." The film is a coup for
independent distributor IFC Films, which has amassed an enviable
string of critical favorites and commercial hits after being launched
18 months ago. The company hit pay dirt with Alfonso Cuaron's "Y Tu
Mama Tambien" and has earned critical plaudits for foreign films
("Together") and documentaries ("Go Tigers"). With "Greek Wedding"
IFC has defied the odds in many ways, including luring older
audiences, an all-but-forgotten demographic these days in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the credit for the company's enviable track record goes to
Bob Berney, a veteran distribution expert whom IFC hired to oversee
its marketing and distribution after seeing him mastermind the
success of "Memento." If you listen to conventional wisdom, there's
no way for a little film to compete against today's studio behemoths.
As Time magazine put it recently: "Why should you pay $10 to have a
meditative, contemplative experience with strangers when you have a
DVD player at home? Films are held at coliseums like the new giant
theaters with stadium seating built for laughing, crying and
screaming at grand heroics."</TE>
<TE>   Studio conglomerates are in the opening-weekend business--movies
often take in as much as 40% of their theatrical income in their
first weekend. "With studios, it's big or nothing," Berney, 48,
explains, sitting in his IFC office in midtown Manhattan, where he
oversees a staff of 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Greek Wedding's" success--it took in $1.7 million this weekend,
with roughly the same per-screen average as "Star Wars: Episode II
Attack of the Clones"--has gone almost unnoticed by the media as
well, which is just as mesmerized by the summer mega-hits as the
studios. Financed by Gold Circle Films and HBO, "Greek Wedding" has
provided a much-needed morale boost for the independent film
business, which has been hit hard by shrinking revenues in the home
video and pay-TV markets.</TE>
<TE>   If "Greek Wedding" takes in $25 million, Berney will be a hero,
but $25 million is chump change for a big studio
release--"Spider-Man" brought in much more than that in one night.
The studios make big-star superhero movies, which are not only
magnets for movie-hungry teenagers but also the most salable films in
home video and pay TV, the industry's biggest profit centers.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, what's nearly destroyed the indie film business isn't the
movies' hit-and-miss performance in theaters, but the precipitous
decline in their home video and pay-TV business. Because of the steep
rise in marketing costs, whether you're big or small, your theatrical
release is practically a loss leader. As Viacom's Mel Karmazin
bluntly put it last year: "Without video rentals, there is no studio
business."</TE>
<TE>   But indies get a tiny piece of that pie. The top video retailers
have frozen out all but the most successful indie films. Although
John Sayles and Ken Loach have made 30 movies between them, I could
only find two of their films in my local Blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as three or four years ago, indies could still count
on chains like Blockbuster to buy two copies for each store of a
theatrically released indie film. At $40 a video, that could add up
to nearly $1 million in revenue, often the difference between profit
and loss for a low-budget film. Today most chains will only pay the
indie film distributor a few dollars to cover its video manufacturing
costs and then offer a percentage of the rental revenues, shifting
the risk from the video stores back to the distributor. . "It's tough
out there," says Berney. "Video has become a high-volume, hit-driven
business."</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the theatrical rights to "Greek Wedding" belonged to
Lions Gate, another indie distributor. When Lions Gate passed,
Goetzman badgered Berney until he agreed to see the movie with an
audience. Within hours, Goetzman had packed a theater with 600
people.</TE>
<TE>   "People loved it," Berney recalls. "I thought, 'They can't all be
his friends.' "</TE>
<TE>   IFC opened the film in eight cities in mid-April, picking towns
that had substantial Greek immigrant communities. Before the movie
opened, IFC invited Greek community and religious leaders to
screenings and organized First Friday clubs to pack theaters with
fans on the film's opening weekend. The film took off, especially
among older audiences. It has played as well in big cities as in
smaller towns, drawing crowds of seniors in Miami and family
filmgoers in Salt Lake City and Oklahoma City.</TE>
<TE>   Berney stopped by the Beekman Theater on New York's East Side one
night. "Instead of skateboards," he recalls, "I saw a stack of
walkers in the lobby. We were getting people that looked like the
last movie they'd seen was 'The Sound of Music.' "</TE>
<TE>   Rita Wilson promoted the movie on "Regis," and Vardalos appeared
on "The Tonight Show," but most of the publicity has come from the
cast's appearances on local radio and TV news shows. Any gimmick was
worth a try. Before the start of the Indianapolis 500, Vardalos and
Corbett circled the racetrack, riding on the hood of a celebrity pace
car outfitted with a banner promoting the movie.</TE>
<TE>   IFC patiently allowed support to build from word of mouth. "If
they'd done a $10-million ad campaign on opening weekend for a movie
no one had ever heard of, the movie would've been over," says
Goetzman. "They gave the publicity and preparation time to pay off."
IFC ran a similar grass-roots campaign with "Y Tu Mama Tambien,"
putting up posters in East L.A. restaurants and plastering Latino
neighborhoods with billboards adorned with a blurb from actress Salma
Hayek. So far the film has grossed $12.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The Latino audience is hugely under-served," says Berney. "They
spend a lot of money on entertainment, and if you market something to
them, they really respond."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its recent success, IFC still faces a host of challenges.
The company has deeper pockets than most independents--its parent
company, Rainbow Holdings, owns the Bravo and IFC cable TV channels.
Berney hopes these corporate connections can provide some promotional
advantages, either by airing making-of documentaries or allowing
tie-ins on Bravo's "Inside the Actors Studio" show.</TE>
<TE>   But having worked at more than one company that overextended
itself and went out of business, Berney is cautious; he tries to
minimize his risks and milk his successes. He recently persuaded
Cuaron to make available both an R-rated and an unrated version of "Y
Tu Mama Tambien" so more video stores would stock the film.</TE>
<TE>   "Success puts you on the map," Berney says. "Instead of us saying,
this is what we're trying to do, we can say we've actually done it."
But you can see from the look on his face that Berney knows he'll
have to keep the hits coming to make it as a little guy in a big
guy's business.</TE>

<HD>'Houston Medical' Raises the Bar on 'Reality'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOEL GREENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Houston, we have a problem.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Houston--like any big city--has myriad problems, but the
most riveting ones seem to end up at Memorial Hermann Hospital. And
it's all captured magnificently in the premiere of "Houston Medical"
on ABC tonight. Given access to the hospital's critical care and
trauma centers during one year, the makers of "Houston Medical" have
produced a taut, stunning hour of television that fictional shows
like "ER"--no matter how well done--could never approach.</LD>
<LD>   "Houston Medical" is technically a documentary, and the fact that
these are real people balancing on the edge of life and death
contributes greatly to the show's allure. This is true reality-TV,
not the pseudo-realism of all those shows that plunk would-be actors
on islands with snakes. But what sets this apart from your standard
PBS documentary--which is usually "interesting" but unlikely to bump
your pulse rate above REM sleep level--are two factors: Emmy-caliber
editing and characters that no Hollywood writer could have dreamed
up.</LD>
<TE>   Take Dr. Marnie Rose, a 27-year-old pediatrician, who handles the
news that she herself has a rare brain cancer with such grace and
aplomb that one can only marvel that she is not an actor. After her
second brain surgery and still in the recovery room with a tube down
her throat, she manages to quip to her father: "That's a load off my
mind."</TE>
<TE>   Or hand surgeon Dr. Mark Henry, an Adonis who displays his
chiseled physique often during the show but cries like a Barbara
Walters interviewee when discussing his beloved patients. Henry's
precision microsurgery to replace a woman's severed finger with one
of her toes is depicted with both the earnestness and humor of the
doctor's personality (the scene in which the woman's fiance shops for
a wedding ring should not be missed).</TE>
<TE>   But "Houston Medical's" most gut-wrenching moments by far come
during neonatologist Dr. Terri Major-Kincade's watch. Kincade, a
soft-spoken mother of two, draws on all her resources to try to save
Nathan, a preemie twin who has potentially lethal bleeding on the
brain. Upon learning the child's life is in danger, Nathan's mother
reacts with such raw emotion, yet quiet dignity, that she winds up as
perhaps the most emotionally compelling character on the show.</TE>
<TE>   That such vignettes are woven together so beautifully and without
a shred of false dramatics or self-pity is a tribute to both the
editors of the yearlong footage and, most important, to the subjects
of the show.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, fictional movies and television shows about mayhem
and disaster don't seem to register as high on the shock scale
anymore. After all, we've witnessed the real thing. "Houston
Medical," perhaps better than any reality-based venture ever, takes
the raw drama of real life and gives it to us with the pace and
veneer of a polished script.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Houston Medical" premieres at 10 tonight on ABC. The network has
rated it TV-PG (may be inappropriate for young children).</TE>

<HD>A Bowl of Mishmash at the Playboy Festival</HD>
<DH>Uneven assemblage of talent and tone ultimately can't carry
the day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to Playboy jazz festivals, there's diversity and
there's goulash. Unlike Saturday's well-paced program, Sunday's
offering at the Hollywood Bowl tossed a bunch of differing
ingredients into a pot in the hope that they would blend into a
complete musical feast. For the most part, they didn't.</LD>
<LD>   The uncertainties surfaced early with the arrival of the Chris
Botti Ensemble. A gifted young trumpeter with an exquisite sound,
Botti has been wandering far too long in the lotus land of smooth
jazz. Although he possesses all the communicative skills of that
genre (at one point he strolled into the audience, a la Kenny G, to
serenade one of his listeners), his playing is well grounded in
fundamental jazz, and it would be interesting to hear how he would
handle a more challenging program of music.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, Botti (whose physical and musical attributes
suggest a Chet Baker-like potential--without Baker's darker
qualities) was placed near the beginning of the day's festivities,
directly after an appearance by the Music Center's Spotlight Awards
ensemble of high school musicians. Presenting Botti, an emerging
talent, in a segment that preceded the arrival of more than half the
audience was a strategic mistake. At the very least, he should have
been scheduled after the appearance by the florid rhythmic gymnastics
of the Gypsy ensemble Les Yeux Noirs.</LD>
<TE>   Aside from Botti, the Sunday program included only three or four
other sparkling highlights. The first was the appearance of Alex
Acuna, Justo Almario and Tolu.</TE>
<TE>   Improving with every outing, this superb locally based ensemble is
ready to step into the national spotlight. Their set was a convincing
display of everything that is right about Latin jazz, with drummer
Acuna linking an array of rhythms in completely seamless fashion and
saxophonist Almario adding envelope-stretching improvisations to the
group's simmering musical mix. Listening to one impressive Tolu
number after another, one could only wonder how long it will take a
major record label to sign this superb ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   The Count Basie Orchestra, conducted by Grover Mitchell, can
always be counted on to enliven any program, and Sunday's was no
exception.</TE>
<TE>   Although the set started badly, with the audio engineers
struggling to figure out the differences between sound reproduction
for big band jazz and rock music, matters eventually came into focus.
When they did, the orchestra, relying mainly upon its familiar
catalog of hard-grooving hits, took the place by storm.</TE>
<TE>   With muscular tenor sax playing from the diminutive Kenny Ling and
some deliciously show-off drumming from Butch Miles leading the way,
the Basie outfit certified the vitality and inventiveness still
present in the big jazz band format.</TE>
<TE>   Blues singer Keb' Mo' isn't really a jazz artist but--like Etta
James on Saturday's program--he is thoroughly immersed in the rich
currents of the blues music that has nourished jazz from its very
beginnings. It was understandable that his life-affirming offerings
delivered in his rich, darkly growling voice--would have the crowd on
their feet, in the aisles, happily waving their handkerchiefs and
napkins. And when he was joined by the Southland's own blues star,
Barbara Morrison, an already elevated program of music rose to an
even higher level of musical exhilaration.</TE>
<TE>   The segment that was clearly designed as the pure jazz focal point
of the day, Directions in Music, featuring Herbie Hancock, Michael
Brecker and Roy Hargrove, did indeed offer some world-class
contemporary jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Hargrove's trumpet playing seems to be gaining more fluency and
adventurousness as he matures, and Brecker's tenor saxophone mastery
was convincingly displayed in a virtuosic, completely solo rendering
of John Coltrane's "Naima." Hancock, bassist George Mraz and drummer
Willie Jones III--from differing generations and different parts of
the world--offered empathetically synchronized musical support.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the balance of the day's events failed to approach
a similar level of achievement.</TE>
<TE>   What in the world, for example, was Bill Cosby doing with his
carefully assembled all-star Cos of Good Music VII ensemble?
Wandering the stage, pointing to musicians, posturing, devoting a
huge portion of his set to a confused rendering of "Bo Diddley,"
Cosby largely wasted the presence of such fine artists as Ernie
Andrews, Monty Alexander, Craig Handy and Ernie Watts.</TE>
<TE>   Patti Austin's tribute to Ella Fitzgerald, performed with the
Basie ensemble, was notable primarily for her remarkable musicality.
In case anyone doubted it, she thoroughly proved that she can handle
the most difficult jazz assignments. But it would be far more
interesting to hear a program that tapped into her own imaginative
roots, rather than simulating the work of one of jazz's legendary
artists.</TE>
<TE>   Winding up the weekend with a funk-driven whimper rather than a
creative bang, the Lee Ritenour ensemble, followed by Karl Denson's
Tiny Universe, primarily seemed to offer getaway accompaniment for
the many listeners making an early move toward the parking lots.</TE>

<HD>Revival of 'The Women' Slices, Dices and Entices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The claws are out, and they're painted "Jungle Red."</LD>
<LD>   A filmed-for-TV performance of Roundabout Theatre's hit 2001
revival of "The Women," Clare Booth Luce's cynical, witty, glam-slam
at the female sex, airs tonight as part of PBS' "Stage on Screen"
series. It stars "Sex and the City's" Cynthia Nixon, Kristen Johnson
("3rd Rock From the Sun"), Rue McClanahan, Jennifer Tilly, Mary
Louise Wilson and Jennifer Coolidge.</LD>
<LD>   Told through wicked bouts of slice-and-dice gossip among
high-society matrons, servants, working girls and gold diggers,
Luce's play is about good but naive wife Mary (Nixon), whose
well-to-do Park Avenue life is shattered by her straying husband and
his hard-as-nails paramour (Tilly).</LD>
<TE>   Mary's helpful "friends" dish the dirt with orgiastic gasps of
pleasure and persuade her to hit the divorce trail to Reno, where she
finally learns her lesson: Pride is "a luxury a woman in love can't
afford."</TE>
<TE>   Though this version is naughtier than the slightly sanitized 1939
George Cukor film that starred Norma Shearer, Rosalind Russell, Joan
Crawford, Paulette Goddard and Joan Fontaine, the play itself was
considered misogynistic by some when first staged in 1936. That this
almost nonstop catfight is beautifully gowned and loaded with
rapid-fire comic wit, though, makes it a guilty pleasure still.</TE>
<TE>   Directed for TV by Jay Sandrich (Scott Elliott directed the stage
production), the filmed version has limitations. Close-ups and camera
cuts detract from the ensemble's interplay and diminish the effect of
the sumptuous gloss and glow of designer Brian MacDevitt's lighting
and the fluid grace of Derek McLane's beautiful set design.</TE>
<TE>   The costumes alone are worth a look. Designer Isaac Mizrahi's
stunning 1930s dresses, coats, sportswear, hats, underwear and
nightwear change with nearly every scene; in the curtain call, each
character takes her bow in lingerie.</TE>
<TE>   And though accents wander at times from Park Avenue to Brooklyn
and parts unknown, the all-female cast is a kick. Nixon adds a spark
to saintly Mary. Gravelly voiced Johnston's imposing height,
deliberately exaggerated by Mizrahi's remarkable hats, and her
ferocious comic chops bring poisonous pal Sylvia to hilarious life.
Coolidge, as viperish, fecund Edith, reaches comic heights when
demonstrating a singular lack of maternal feeling, as when, puffing a
cigarette, she grudgingly nurses her latest newborn: "Dammit, this
thing has jaws like a dinosaur."</TE>
<TE>   McClanahan, playing the much-married Countess who still believes
in "L'amour," despite her husbands' penchants for arsenic and
mountain-climbing accidents, is a hoot throughout. Tilly's voluptuous
Allen is almost too coarse to make her home-wrecking appeal
believable. But then, subtlety isn't what this fanged, retro object
lesson is about.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Women" can be seen at 9 tonight on KCET-TV. It has been rated
TV-PG (may be inappropriate for young children.)</TE>

<HD>Valuable 'Nick News' Examines Gay Parenting</HD>

<LD>Hate is wrong. "Am I right on that?" Linda Ellerbee asks in tonight's
"Nick News Special Edition."</LD>
<LD>   If that is "pro-homosexual propaganda"--as Andrea Lafferty,
director of the Traditional Values Coalition, has charged about this
bold and valuable kids' special she didn't see--then Jerry Falwell
himself is pro-gay.</LD>
<LD>   Falwell's knee-jerk gay bashing has sometimes earned him ridicule
even among some of his fellow fundamentalist Christians. But he
speaks from the other side of his mouth in this half-hour, titled "My
Family Is Different," which explores issues related to gay parenting
without preaching.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think gays and lesbians should in any way be harassed or
robbed of their civil rights," Falwell says in a segment taped at
Liberty University, where he is chancellor. On the other hand, he
again calls homosexuality a "lifestyle," as if he could exchange his
heterosexual "lifestyle" for those of Ellerbee's gay adult guests: a
fireman, a school principal and outgoing TV talk-show host Rosie
O'Donnell, a parent who has publicly acknowledged being lesbian.</TE>
<TE>   Ellerbee, longtime host and producer of "Nick News," keeps the
promise she makes here not to tell kids "what to think" about
homosexuality. Instead, in addition to Falwell, there's a short film
about the pressures schoolmates put on a 12-year-old girl because she
has "two moms." And Ellerbee--as always approaching her subject from
a young perspective without talking down--explores the hate issue
with youngsters in the studio, all of whom appear to be among the
most thoughtful kids on the planet.</TE>
<TE>   As the host mostly just listens, three say they have at least one
gay parent, and three say they believe homosexuality to be "wrong."
Several represent minorities historically victimized in the United
States by the same kind of hate and prejudice inflicted on gays.</TE>
<TE>   "It's against our religion," a Muslim girl says of homosexuality.
"But it's also against our religion to discriminate." A strong
message, another strong Ellerbee show--one that parents should join
their kids in watching.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Nick News Special Edition: My Family Is Different" can be seen at
9 tonight on Nickelodeon. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be
unsuitable for younger children).</TE>

<HD>'Follies' Remains Marvelous Contradiction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arguably the best score ever written for an extended midlife crisis,
Stephen Sondheim's "Follies" practically invented a new entertainment
form when it stunned Broadway in 1971. Call it "musical tragicomedy."</LD>
<LD>   That's not as paradoxical as it sounds, because the emotional
trials and tribulations of this melancholy show's four
post-menopausal main characters, lightened by Sondheim's mordant wit
and peerless craftsmanship, make "Follies" a marvelous contradiction:
an invigorating bummer.</LD>
<LD>   The most high-concept of musicals, "Follies" has another built-in
twist that helps rescue the creaky and uneven but affecting new
Reprise! Production running at the Wadsworth Theatre. Set in a
crumbling Broadway theater that's soon to make way for a parking lot,
"Follies" tracks the bittersweet reunion of a gaggle of aging
showgirls who formerly sang and danced together in the glittering
Ziegfeld-style spectaculars that once ruled the Great White Way.</LD>
<TE>   Worn faces and weathered voices are the essence of "Follies' "
brutally anti-nostalgic point of view. And though there's more
graying talent here than in a seniors' golf tournament, Father Time
has bestowed his blessings and burdens on the cast unevenly, just as
he does in "Follies."</TE>
<TE>   So while it's easy to marvel at how Carol Lawrence (the original
Maria in "West Side Story") has retained her willowy elegance through
the years, or at Amanda McBroom's va-va-voom playfulness in "Ah,
Paris!" it's also easy--up to a point--to smile affectionately when
one of these old pros croaks out a high note or flubs a verse. What
this short-run production lacks in polish it mostly compensates for
in pathos. Happily, of the four principal performers, three are
keepers. Vikki Carr, a three-time Grammy winner, gets the plum role
of Sally Durant, the preternaturally perky ex-hoofer who still pines
for dour ex-beau and current Manhattan power broker Ben Stone (Bob
Gunton). Sally's husband, Buddy (Harry Groener) is a boyish good-time
Charlie, expert at keeping his darker emotions at bay with rim-shot
ripostes.</TE>
<TE>   Supple in voice and spirit, Groener and Carr shed years before our
eyes. Gunton has a suave insouciance on numbers like "The Road You
Didn't Take"--until his haunted gaze gives away his crippling (and
deeply moving) despair.</TE>
<TE>   Less captivating is Patty Duke, who's cast against good judgment
(if not against type) as Ben's long-suffering wife Phyllis. "Follies"
is Duke's stage singing and dancing debut, which is like taking up
mountain climbing on the north face of Everest. But Duke's raspy
earnestness and old-school grit may finally win you over (as they did
me), singing and dancing be damned--which is no slight on Kay Cole's
snappy choreography.</TE>
<TE>   In a smart Brechtian conceit, the four aging leads are trailed
throughout the show by youthful versions of their plumper, richer,
more overtly neurotic older selves (well played by Jean Louisa Kelly,
Tia Riebling, Kevin Earley and Austin Miller). The old couples flirt,
fight, reminisce, get sloshed and reunite with their respective mates
just in time for Phyllis to utter a doozy of a platitude about how
"hope doesn't grow on trees, we have to make our own." Groan.
Fortunately, such triteness is atypical of "Follies' " life lessons
about the delusions we too often mistake for love and success.</TE>
<TE>   It says much for Reprise!, the 5-year-old L.A. musical theater
series, that it summons but seldom succumbs to "Follies' " bipolar
mood swings. As future New York Times critic Frank Rich noted 30
years ago in reviewing the show's pre-Broadway tryout, these
over-the-hill chorines and balding stage-door Johnnies are basically
attending their own funeral, witnessing the death of a popular art
form and a worldview that hailed from a sunnier, less self-conscious
America. Apart from a couple of solemn stretches, director Arthur
Allan Seidelman and company manage to keep the evening from turning
into a wake.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Klausen's set design conveys the correctly elegiac mood,
framing the Wadsworth proscenium with a tattered Art Deco curtain and
a truncated staircase buttressed by a pair of golden caryatids
straight out of an Erte catalog.</TE>
<TE>   And when the action flags or a note hits the stage with a clunk,
we always have Sondheim's mesmerizing score, beautifully performed by
a bulked-up 19-piece Reprise! orchestra, skillfully conducted by
musical director Gerald Sternbach.</TE>
<TE>   From torchy standards like "Losing My Mind," to Ben and Sally's
heartbreaking duet of missed chances, "Too Many Mornings," to Donna
McKechnie's less-is-definitely more rendition of the survival anthem
"I'm Still Here," to note-perfect pastiches of silly Jazz Age
ditties, this is surely one of the dozen or so greatest song cycles
America ever has produced. Its vitality reminds us, as "Follies"
does, that what's most cherishable in life never really gets old.</TE>

<HD>O Brother, Here Art Thou</HD>
<DH>At bluegrass festivals, performances play second fiddle to
family-like campground jams</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GRASS VALLEY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Bruce Strand isn't intending to play a lick right now. It's dusk, and
he's walking around trying to find old friends and fellow musicians
among hundreds of campsites crowded beneath towering ponderosa pines.</LD>
<LD>   But when you're considered one of the best old-style fiddle
players in the West, maybe even the country, people seek you out. As
Strand stands at the side of a road talking to a man with a guitar, a
husband and wife--fiddlers both--sidle up and exchange pleasantries
before the husband shoves an old, battered fiddle into Strand's
hands, urging him to try it.</LD>
<LD>   Strand, eager to please, tucks the instrument under his chin and
drops the bow lightly on the strings, a little bouncy motion that
fills the air with a hint of a chord, then breaks into an intricate
riff of soulful gentleness.</LD>
<TE>   The wife, standing on the campground road, figures out where
Strand is going with the song and begins playing her fiddle, quickly
joined by the man with the guitar. The trio wordlessly evokes dark
passions and bygone days as a late-arriving RV slowly swerves around
them, yielding the right of way to the true soul of the bluegrass
festival--the jam.</TE>
<TE>   Over a three-day span, scores of professional musicians will run
through their repertoires here at the Nevada County Fairground stage
during the California Bluegrass Assn.'s 27th annual Father's Day
Weekend Festival.</TE>
<TE>   But those performances are only the backdrop to the real event, a
massive family reunion in which musical passion is the bloodline, and
where the main attraction lies in the freewheeling campsite jam
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I came here, I listened to the shows, but then I
figured out the fun is the jam," says Bob Baumert, 55, a regular for
more than two decades, but who ventures to the stage only every two
or three years. "It bothers me when my friends have groups and we
have to go down and listen to them."</TE>
<TE>   With the success of "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" and its
Grammy-winning soundtrack, bluegrass and traditional country music
have become the consumable pop morsels of the moment, particularly
among listeners who tend to flit among musical styles.</TE>
<TE>   Yet bluegrass trackers say the movie's success followed a trend
rather than led it, fueled by fans seeking a music form perceived to
be authentic and outside the marketing mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   "As happens many times in the entertainment world, this is one of
those overnight successes that has taken 15 years to blossom," said
Dan Hayes, executive director of the International Bluegrass
Musicians Assn. in Owensboro, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   Bluegrass fans have come to the music from different directions.
There are older fans--such as Baumert, an Arkansas native whose
family roots run deep in the Ozarks--who hear the notes of home in
the music.</TE>
<TE>   Some are folk music fans seeking to strip that form back to a
simpler and more authentic root. And then there's the legacy of the
Dead.</TE>
<TE>   "There are the jam bands, sort of a takeoff on the whole Grateful
Dead scene, with groups from Phish to Leftover Salmon to the Dave
Matthews Band doing it," says Hayes. "Those are not bluegrass bands,
but there's a relationship in the sound, and a lot of those fans are
finding bluegrass and roots music through that side door."</TE>
<TE>   Although embraced as traditional music, bluegrass arose in the
1930s when singer-mandolinist Bill Monroe invigorated slow-moving
"old time" music by speeding the tempo and adding intricate acoustic
solos and high-end harmonies.</TE>
<TE>   Folk fans rediscovered the music in the '60s and '70s, but it
faded again in the '80s until a third wave of interest developed in
the late '90s, fueled in part by such mainstream country performers
as Ricky Scaggs and Dolly Parton, and the iconoclastic Steve Earle,
who have embraced it.</TE>
<TE>   But the real growth has come in the festivals, which have expanded
from about 50 in the mid-'70s to more than 500 a year, Hayes said.</TE>
<TE>   The Grass Valley festival is preceded by a three-day music camp
that drew 112 students last year, the first time it was held, and 173
students this year. Attendance at the festival itself, in its 27th
year, has grown steadily from a few hundred to more than 5,000, about
three-quarters of whom stay in the campground, organizers say.</TE>
<TE>   One of the music's draws is familiarity. While new bluegrass acts
write many of their own songs, the genre has a wide set of standards
that provide a common language at the jam sessions. Many of the songs
have a hokey, kitschy tone to them, the lyrics unabashedly waxing
nostalgic for a romanticized past that may have never existed.</TE>
<TE>   But other songs can be piercing in their lyricism, rooted in
universal themes of loss and longing--emotions perfectly evoked by
keening harmonies and the lonesome wail of a fiddle.</TE>
<TE>   Another appeal: the simplicity of the festivals themselves.</TE>
<TE>   At the Grass Valley event, among the largest of dozens held in
California each year, there is limited outside marketing. Concession
stands consist of a handful of food booths, crafts, music supplies
and an incongruous massage table. There's also a large shed housing
vendors selling handmade instruments.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the main grounds, performers camp next to festival-goers,
and after leaving the stage band members often filter through the
campground, jamming with fans into the night.</TE>
<TE>   The music itself is played mostly in a simple 4/4 time, which
means novices capable of chord progressions can sit in and not
embarrass themselves.</TE>
<TE>   But it's what virtuosos like Strand do with their solos--called
"breaks"--that defines the music.</TE>
<TE>   Strand is in high demand for jams and plays up to seven hours a
day at festivals. A slightly built California native, Strand studied
classical violin as a child but turned to bluegrass when he met some
Kentucky-bred musicians in the early '50s as a U.S. Marine in Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been playing it ever since," says Strand, who last year
placed fourth in the senior division of the annual National Oldtime
Fiddlers' Contest in Weiser, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the draw of the festival is more than the music itself, Strand
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You get out here and meet people and build up friendships," he
said. "It seems like we're all one, big happy family. It's a real
neat thing."</TE>
<TE>   For some fans, Strand himself is a draw.</TE>
<TE>   It's late at night, nearly 11, and Larry Cordle &amp; Lonesome
Standard Time can be heard closing out the day's lineup on the
distant stage. Three campers are circled like prairie wagons around
two massive ponderosas, and Strand and a handful of other musicians
perch in the middle on folding chairs. A handful of nonmusicians,
spouses mostly, sit in the shadows beyond the reach of the campers'
lights.</TE>
<TE>   Strand is one of three fiddlers. The number of guitars keeps
changing, peaking at five, as players drop in for a few songs then
wander off to find another jam. There's also a banjo and two upright
basses, though only one is played at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Before the festival, Strand had played with only two of the other
musicians, but the atmosphere is loose and friendly, as among old
friends. Self-deprecating jokes are part of the bond. There is no
hierarchy; anyone can suggest a song.</TE>
<TE>   One of the nonplayers asks for "Ashokan Farewell," a mournful tune
written in 1982 and popularized in Ken Burns' 1990 "Civil War"
documentary.</TE>
<TE>   The group launches into the song, but no one sings as the
musicians move through the piece with fluid emotion, Strand leading
the way. Eyes half-closed, Strand loses himself in the music, teasing
wordless pain and longing from the strings as the other musicians
play softly behind him.</TE>
<TE>   A few passersby stop, drawn by the mournful sounds, and listen
quietly as Strand takes the piece to its gentle end.</TE>
<TE>   At the last moment, the other instruments fall silent while Strand
holds the final note, a soft transcendent tremolo that spins
loneliness off into the dark soul of night.</TE>
<TE>   In the silent pause that follows, Strand's face creases in
satisfaction, and then the applause begins.</TE>

<LD>   Presley Remix Tops Charts, Shatters Record</LD>
<LD>   Elvis Presley has the top spot on the U.K. singles chart for the
first time since he died in 1977, making him the artist with the most
No. 1 recordings in England, according to the Guinness Book of
Records.</LD>
<TE>   For 25 years, Presley had been tied with the Beatles at 17 apiece.
On the Billboard charts monitoring U.S. success, however, the Fab
Four still hold an edge--with 20 top singles to the King's 18.</TE>
<TE>   The latest recording, a remix of Presley's 1968 track "A Little
Less Conversation," hit the top of the U.K. charts Sunday with
first-week sales of nearly 250,000 copies. The original, a
little-known tune written by Mac Davis and Billy Strange for the '68
film "Live a Little, Love a Little," also surfaced on the soundtrack
of the 2001 movie "Ocean's Eleven."</TE>
<TE>   Dutch musician Tom Holkenburg, known in Europe as the disc jockey
of the techno-group Junkie XL, remixed the song for a Nike television
commercial airing during this month's World Cup soccer tournament.
Though it's funkier and more contemporary than the original, "Elvis
vs. JXL--a Little Less Conversation" leaves Presley's distinctive
vocals intact.</TE>
<TE>   RCA/ BMG Heritage will release the single in the United States on
June 25.</TE>

<TE>   'Harlem Nutcracker' Debt Sinks Byrd Troupe</TE>
<TE>   Donald Byrd/The Group, a 24-year-old modern dance company focusing
on African American history and culture, is closing. The move was
taken in response to financial problems triggered, in large part, by
the company's most ambitious undertaking: the $1.2-million
transformation of "The Nutcracker" into "The Harlem Nutcracker,"
which premiered in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Though the enterprise was artistically successful and toured
extensively throughout the U.S., Byrd struggled for six years to pay
off the debt, which still amounts to about $400,000, the New York
Times reports.</TE>
<TE>   With an annual budget of just under $1 million, the 10-member
company also has an accumulated deficit of another $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   The final performance of the group, known for its unusual themes
and eclectic style, took place Sunday in Santa Fe.</TE>

<TE>   Durst Still Emotional About Fan's Death</TE>
<TE>   Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said Monday that he cautioned tour
promoter Vivian Lee about security problems before a teenage fan died
in a crowd crush. The warning came on the heels of a similar episode
in Auckland, New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   Durst's statement came as part of an Australian inquest
investigating the death of 15-year-old Jessica Michalik, who suffered
a heart attack during a Limp Bizkit performance in that city on Jan.

<TE>   "It was so overwhelming that a young girl came to see her favorite
band and left in a coma and died," Durst said, testifying by video
from Los Angeles. "I'm very emotional right now talking about it.
It's taken me a long time to talk about this."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the inquiry, coroner Jacqueline Milledge can
recommend that charges be filed, but prosecutors don't have to act on
the recommendation.</TE>

<TE>   S.F. Symphony Gets Use of Heifetz Violin</TE>
<TE>   Jascha Heifetz's $6-million violin has been played publicly only
once or twice a year in the last decade. But starting Sept. 4, it
will be played regularly by San Francisco Symphony concertmaster
Alexander Barantschik for the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   The use of the 260-year-old violin in all the concerts Barantschik
plays, as well as in a new chamber-music series, comes out of an
arrangement worked out between the symphony and the city's Fine Arts
Museum, where the instrument has been on display for the last 15
years.</TE>
<TE>   Heifetz bequeathed his favorite violin to the venue when he died
in 1987, stipulating that it be played by "worthy performers." Those
who qualified include Isaac Stern, Gil Shaham and some San Francisco
Conservatory students.</TE>
<TE>   The violin, built by the Italian Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesu, is
one of about 130 such instruments in existence.</TE>
<TE>   Musicians Cancel Montreal Appearances</TE>
<TE>   Pianist Emanuel Ax and cellist Yo-Yo Ma have canceled appearances
with the Montreal Symphony next year out of sympathy for Charles
Dutoit, who resigned as music director earlier this year, the Web
site Andante reports.</TE>
<TE>   Dutoit stepped down after orchestra members challenged his
dismissal of musicians and accused him of tyrannical behavior.</TE>
<TE>   According to an orchestra spokesperson, neither Ax nor Ma was
comfortable performing as part of what was to be Dutoit's
25th-anniversary season.</TE>
<TE>   Pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich also
have canceled appearances in solidarity with Dutoit.</TE>

<HD>'Scooby-Doo' Solves the Case of the Cartoon as Live-Action
Film</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe they should call the sequel "Scooby-Dough."</LD>
<LD>   Fueled by a widespread affinity among TV viewers young and old for
that chicken-hearted cartoon canine Scooby-Doo, the movie of the same
name overcame an avalanche of negative reviews over the weekend to
become one of the year's biggest hits--so big, in fact, that
Burbank-based Warner Bros. hurriedly disclosed plans to make a
sequel, scheduled to hit theaters in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Final figures show that "Scooby-Doo" premiered with $54.2 million,
the second-biggest June opening of any film behind only "Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," which took in $54.9 million in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Turning a cartoon favorite into a live-action hit on the big
screen is one of the trickiest endeavors in Hollywood, whose
landscape is littered with failures like "Josie and the Pussycats,"
"Mr. Magoo" and "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle," which all
tanked at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   But when they hit, they can be among the more profitable
films--witness "The Flintstones," which grossed $130.5 million in
1994; "George of the Jungle" (1997), with $105.3 million; and
"Casper" (1995), with $100.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros., which released "Scooby-Doo," has known for some time
that it had a popular show on its hands. The Hanna-Barbera cartoon
had been a fan favorite since it premiered on CBS in the fall of
1969. Since then, Scooby and the Mystery Inc. gang--Fred, Daphne,
Shaggy and Velma--have appeared in 310 episodes on numerous networks.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Warner executives were exulting in their marketing
efforts, noting that this was one instance in which synergy did, in
fact, work.</TE>
<TE>   "First, there was tremendous affinity for the character of
Scooby-Doo," said Dawn Taubin, president of domestic marketing at
Warner Bros. Pictures, who noted that 60% of moviegoers interviewed
said they had watched the TV cartoon, either as kids or currently.</TE>
<TE>   Casting helped bring kids into the theaters, Taubin said. (The
studio is hoping to sign the same cast for the sequel.) Sarah
Michelle Gellar, who plays Daphne, is the star of the hit TV show
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer," while Freddie Prinze Jr., who plays Fred,
has appeared in popular teen films such as "She's All That" and "I
Know What You Did Last Summer." Also starring are Matthew Lillard as
Shaggy and Linda Cardellini as Velma.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids know who this cast is," Taubin said, adding that the cast
members did numerous TV spots for the film aimed at younger
audiences, including the recent MTV Movie Awards. The soundtrack also
featured hot young acts like the Grammy-nominated Atlanta rap group
OutKast and the Bahamian pop group Baha Men.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, AOL Time Warner capitalized on its top-to-bottom
synergy to market the film, from running reruns of the original
"Scooby-Doo" on its Cartoon Network to hosting chat rooms and games
on America Online's "Scooby-Doo" Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The studio also tried to get the word out early that the film was
coming. It had been running a teaser trailer as far back as last
Christmas. In addition, when the movie came out this weekend, Warner
Bros. had attached the trailer of its next big sequel, "Harry Potter
and the Chamber of Secrets" to the "Scooby-Doo" print.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box-office tracking firm
Exhibitor Relations Co., said the film was helped by the fact that
moviegoers are in the mood for fun fare.</TE>
<TE>   "Family films are doing quite well right now. There aren't many of
them, and they really fill a void in the marketplace. The world is
not the most pleasant place right now, and the moviegoing public is
looking to have a good time."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Fellman, who heads distribution at Warner Bros., said
"Scooby-Doo" had the biggest June opening of any Warner Bros. film
ever.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Scooby-Doo' is older than he looks," Fellman said. "He is such
a lovable character, he has been able to span these generations."</TE>
<TE>   Reviewers largely panned the film. Critic Roger Ebert of the
Chicago Sun-Times, for instance, said the computer-animated
Scooby-Doo himself was "an island of amusement in a wasteland of
fecklessness." The Los Angeles Times' Robin Rauzi, meanwhile, said
the film's director, Raja Gosnell, "drains all the potential out of
the Scooby premise to carve out this hollow kids' movie."</TE>
<TE>   But as the first weekend figures attest, these kinds of movies are
usually review-proof.</TE>

<HD>Cheeky Gags Open Another Season of 'Beach'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Son of the Beach," which begins its third season at 10 tonight on
FX, would seem to be an argument that you can judge a show by its
title. Ribald and politically incorrect, the series leaves no double
entendre alone, no pun unintended. But to dismiss it as just plain
dumb would be wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's one-hour installment seemingly draws upon the three B's
of television: "Baywatch," which the series as a whole parodies;
"Benny Hill's" tales of sex and the silly; and "Big Brother," or,
more precisely, the unscripted-TV craze.</LD>
<LD>   Virtually everything on the show is a joke. Start with some of the
tamer character names: Kimberlee Clark; Porcelain Bidet. Then there's
the hero, Notch Johnson (a deadpan Tim Stack), the world's greatest
lifeguard the way Maxwell Smart of "Get Smart" was the world's
greatest spy. "I've taken quite a shine to Porcelain," Notch says at
one point.</LD>
<TE>   This week, he and his swimsuit-clad crew from the city of Malibu
Adjacent become contestants on a "Temptation Island"-style show. It's
the brainchild of network owner Tex Finkelstein (guest star Jason
Alexander), who reacts to the high ratings by saying, "Woohoo! I'll
be hogtied and schmaltzed like a herring."</TE>
<TE>   As usual, "Son of the Beach" employs bathroom humor, sexual
innuendo and raunchy sight gags in a scattershot approach that yields
many hits and misses.</TE>
<TE>   Each episode is also rife with equal-opportunity offending. A
partial list of targets tonight: whites, blacks, Latinos, blond
women, gay men, Jews, neo-Nazis, Catholic priests, the disabled and
sadomasochists. With just about everyone being made fun of, it's hard
to work up much outrage.</TE>
<TE>   And right when you think the humor will never rise above schoolboy
level, along comes a zinger about something weightier, like product
placement or the troubling coverage of "reality" shows as news by
self-promoting networks.</TE>
<TE>   "Son of the Beach" isn't the smartest or funniest show on TV, but
it is confident enough to forgo a laugh track and, in the end, can be
classified as cleverly stupid.</TE>

<HD>Recording Industry Reaches Pact With File-Sharing Site
Audiogalaxy.com</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recording industry knocked another online file-sharing site out
of the piracy business Monday when Audiogalaxy.com agreed to limit
its network to songs that labels, artists and songwriters had
approved for sharing.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement brings a quick end to a copyright-infringement
lawsuit the major record labels and music publishers filed last month
against the Austin, Texas-based online music company. The settlement
also calls for Audiogalaxy to pay labels and publishers an
undisclosed but substantial sum.</LD>
<LD>   Audiogalaxy tried to keep its users from downloading some
copyrighted songs from one another's computers, but its efforts
weren't effective enough for the labels and publishers. Under the
settlement, Audiogalaxy will be able to continue linking users to
songs authorized for downloading by their copyright holders, as it
has been doing for a number of independent labels and bands.</LD>
<TE>   The labels had pushed for this kind of limitation on Napster Inc.
of Redwood City, Calif., as well, but the courts stopped short of
requiring that all files be pre-approved. Instead, U.S. District
Judge Marilyn Hall Patel required Napster to take all technically
feasible steps to prevent piracy--a requirement so strict that the
company shut down its free service. It has since declared bankruptcy,
though it plans to reemerge as a subsidiary of media conglomerate
Bertelsmann.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from Audiogalaxy could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Devices That Move Digital Media Complicate Piracy Clampdown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While Hollywood studios try to rein in what consumers can do with
digital files, some consumer-electronics companies are speeding ahead
with products that make it even easier for people to move movies and
music around the home and the Web.</LD>
<LD>   The latest example is a gadget Toshiba Corp. is unveiling today
that's an electronic library for photos, songs and movies. The device
moves digital media wirelessly across the home and lets people share
their audio-video collections over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Toshiba's biggest competitors also are working on electronic
libraries that can deliver entertainment throughout the home and, in
some cases, via the Net. By the end of the year, at least half a
dozen companies are expected to have these kinds of products on the
market or in final planning stages, said Jeremy Toeman of Mediabolic
Inc., a software firm that specializes in home entertainment
networks.</LD>
<TE>   These devices illustrate the challenge facing the studios and
other copyright holders as they try to clamp down on Internet piracy.
The more consumers become accustomed to moving media around their
home and the Net, the harder it may be to put an electronic leash on
digital movies and music.</TE>
<TE>   "Every June a digitally savvy generation of young people
graduates," said analyst Richard Doherty of the Envisioneering Group
consulting firm, "and they graduate into higher income and more toys.
And those toys are built to share" digital files.</TE>
<TE>   The new breed of device is designed to be the centerpiece of a
digital home network that transmits entertainment and information to
any room with a computer or TV screen. Relatively few homes have
these networks today, but the demand is expected to grow as consumers
amass digital collections of music, photos and videos on their
computers.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Dinsdale, a top digital strategist for the Motion Picture
Assn. of America, said the group's goal is to protect the studios'
copyrighted works without restricting the flow of noncommercial
material or stopping independent producers from distributing files
under their own rules. "We strongly encourage consumer-electronics
companies to talk to us about their ideas and their plans."</TE>
<TE>   Many do. For example, Pioneer Electronics USA Inc. modified its
as-yet-unreleased electronic library to block access to files through
the Internet. The move deters pirates from copying video clips and
music, but it also stops owners of the device from accessing their
digital photos, home movies and other personal items through the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Toshiba's Wireless Media Center has two hard drives that store and
back up digital music, video and photo files from its owner's
computers. It uses common wireless or wired techniques to connect to
Internet-enabled digital devices in the home, including computers and
home automation systems.</TE>
<TE>   The media center also links to the Internet through a high-speed
phone or cable modem, making its electronic library available through
a private, secure Web site. With the right electronic keys, anyone
can connect to a media center through the Web and play the files
stored there, effectively turning the device into an online jukebox.</TE>
<TE>   The Web connection also can be used to watch live video feeds from
digital cameras connected to the media center, or to control home
appliances remotely, said Oscar Koenders, vice president of worldwide
product planning for Toshiba Computer Systems Group. Koenders said
the digital cameras connected to his media center let relatives in
Holland pay virtual visits to his home.</TE>
<TE>   Toeman of Mediabolic said every consumer-electronics company has a
different approach to the security issue, with some far more
sensitive to Hollywood's concerns than others. The biggest issue, he
said, is keeping consumers' personal collections from being pirated
through the Internet--a problem exacerbated by the inclusion of
Internet-connected computers in home networks.</TE>
<TE>   Mediabolic and other software providers have added several layers
of security to their networking technology to help personal networks
stay private. "We think those are the kind of mechanisms that are
going to have to be put in place to get the copyright holders to
start approving these types of systems," Toeman said.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem I have with what they're doing now, they're so scared
of the technology, they're not trying things."</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Delays Action on Stock-Option Policy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The board of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the
biggest U.S. pension fund, Monday postponed action on a
recommendation from its staff that would compel companies to deduct
the cost of employee stock options from earnings.</LD>
<LD>   Citing arguments from technology companies that there is no
standard methodology for valuing options, the fund's directors asked
the staff to develop alternative stock-option disclosure practices.</LD>
<LD>   "I do wish somehow options could be shown as an expense because
they are, but I don't think we know enough to adopt that today," said
William Crist, president of CalPERS.</LD>
<TE>   The decision by the fund is a blow to corporate governance reform
efforts stemming from Enron Corp.'s collapse and alleged financial
abuses by a host of other major companies in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Berkshire Hathaway
Chairman Warren Buffett and John Biggs, chairman of the Teachers
Insurance &amp; Annuity Assn.-College Retirement Equities Fund, have
pressed for companies to expense options.</TE>
<TE>   But CalPERS, which has $149 billion under management, was lobbied
by venture capitalists and tech companies to reject the staff
proposal. John Doerr, a general partner of venture capital firm
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, said before the vote that stock
options would disappear as a recruiting tool for start-up firms if
their potential value had to be deducted from earnings, reducing
companies' reported profit.</TE>
<TE>   In directing its staff to devise alternative executive
compensation disclosure practices, CalPERS asked them to include ways
in which the fund could punish companies that aren't forthcoming with
certain financial items.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) introduced a
bill this year that would deny option-related tax benefits to firms
that don't expense option costs.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said in May that companies' "failure to expense option
grants has introduced a significant distortion in reported
earnings--one that has grown with the increasing prevalence of this
form of compensation."</TE>

<HD>Capstone a Bargain?</HD>
<DH>An unusual cash situation creates opportunity for buyers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There may be a lot of bargains on Wall Street these days but perhaps
none like Capstone Turbine Corp., the Chatsworth-based maker of
high-tech power generators.</LD>
<LD>   The stock market has so soured on Capstone that a clever suitor
might be able to acquire the company for free.</LD>
<LD>   That's because the amount of cash Capstone has on its
books--$164.4 million--is significantly more than its $123-million
stock market value as of Monday and its $12 million in liabilities.</LD>
<TE>   Once one of hottest stocks to emerge from the state's energy
crisis, Capstone shares traded close to $100 each less than two years
ago, but since have fallen to single digits, closing Monday at $1.59
a share, up 7 cents, on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   This has created an unusual situation in which an opportunistic
buyer could offer shareholders a premium over the share price,
acquire Capstone and then use the company's cash to fund the
transaction, according to several analysts and investment fund
portfolio managers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not common for the net cash holdings of a company to exceed
the market value of its common stock," said Marty Whitman, manager of
Third Avenue Value Fund. "But this looks like a heck of a speculative
play."</TE>
<TE>   Whitman said Capstone's management would have the best shot at
pulling off such a transaction, because "insiders always have the
advantage." In Capstone's case, company management controls 8% of the
stock.</TE>
<TE>   But outsiders might be able to work "a tremendous deal" because of
the unique cash position, Whitman said.</TE>
<TE>   Capstone officials declined to talk about whether they have been
approached by a potential buyer or would consider using the company's
money to take it private.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very peculiar situation, and it certainly has come to
the attention of our board of directors," said Ake Almgren,
Capstone's chief executive. "Our focus is to develop the company, not
to sell it."</TE>
<TE>   Two giant industrial companies are interested in microturbine
technology similar to what is used in Capstone's generators.
Ingersoll-Rand Co. has launched its own line of generators, and
General Electric Co. purchased microturbine patents and equipment
from Honeywell International Inc. in December.</TE>
<TE>   Capstone makes fuel-efficient, low-emission microturbine power
generators that sell for $25,000 to $55,000, depending on their size
and configuration.</TE>
<TE>   Using technology similar to what is in a jet aircraft engine,
Capstone's refrigerator-size machines run on natural gas and other
fuels. The smallest generator produces about 30 kilowatts, enough to
power a fast-food restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market became enamored of Capstone practically from the
day it went public at $16 a share in June 2000, which happened to
coincide with escalation of the state's burgeoning energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Investors rushed in, believing that high electricity prices and
blackouts in California would create demand for machines that
provided a backup or alternate power source. Shares closed at an
all-time high of $94.38 on Sept. 1, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But interest in Capstone's machines has remained scant. Though its
technology is well regarded, the company sells about 1,000 generators
annually, too few to be able to produce machines at a profit.</TE>
<TE>   "It is almost painful [for Capstone] to sell one of these things
these days," said Cyrus Lowe, an analyst at J.P. Morgan in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Capstone's cash holding position is the remainder of $426 million
raised in various public and private stock offerings over the last
decade. The company has never turned a profit since going public, and
lost $12 million on revenue of only $4.6 million in the first quarter
of 2002. At that pace, it will burn through its remaining cash in
three to four years.</TE>
<TE>   Capstone executives acknowledge that the stock's sizzling run-up
in 2000 was due to eager investors who underestimated how long the
company would take to break into the power generator market. But the
executives say the current share price does not reflect the value of
the company.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Clark, Capstone's chief financial officer, said she hopes a
prospective buyer does not emerge now but waits for Capstone to
better develop the microturbine market and then make a bid when the
stock price has rebounded.</TE>
<TE>   Companies are cautious about adopting new technology, especially
in a slow economy when capital spending is down. Capstone is finding
that the generators make the most economic sense in situations in
which the heat from their exhaust can be used for heating and
air-conditioning systems.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge, for example, uses a bank of six Capstone
generators to provide the electricity for its central heating and
cooling plant, recycling the machines' heat back into its system.</TE>
<TE>   But like many of Capstone's customers, CSUN's use is experimental.
And in this instance, it's supported by government grants.</TE>
<TE>   And companies that do use traditional generators, typically those
with reciprocating engines, are less willing to adopt replacement
technology, particularly when capital- spending projects are being
scrutinized.</TE>
<TE>   "It can take a decade to bring a new piece of power generation
equipment onto the market," said Eric Prouty, an analyst at Adams,
Harkness &amp; Hill in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Capstone's stock turned down as the California energy crisis
abated. Investors sold out when they realized that the expected
electricity blackouts were not developing, and that businesses would
not be making big investments in backup power systems.</TE>
<TE>   Then the economy slumped, further dampening capital spending and
investment.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Capstone developed a reputation for missing Wall
Street's earnings and revenue targets.</TE>
<TE>   That created skepticism about the management, especially Jeffrey
Watts, the previous chief financial officer, who was responsible for
explaining Capstone's financial status to the investment community,
Lowe said.</TE>
<TE>   The company's low share price now "means that investors are
apathetic about the growth opportunities for this stock," he said.</TE>

<HD>Nestle Scoops Up Dreyer's</HD>
<DH>Food: The Swiss company will gain control of the No. 1 U.S.
ice cream maker in a $2.4-billion transaction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nestle on Monday reached a deal to take a majority stake in Dreyer's
Grand Ice Cream Inc. as part of a $2.4-billion transaction that would
allow the Swiss conglomerate to eventually swallow all of
Oakland-based Dreyer's.</LD>
<LD>   The combination will bring together Dreyer's ice cream brands, the
bestselling in the United States, with Nestle's Haagen Dazs, and
close the gap with global leader Anglo-Dutch group Unilever.
Unilever's brands include Ben &amp; Jerry's, Good Humor and Breyer's.</LD>
<LD>   News of the deal sent Dreyer's stock surging $24.50, or 57%, to
$67.29 on Nasdaq.</LD>
<TE>   "This move underscores our commitment to growing and improving our
ice cream business ... in the world's highest per capita consumption
market, the USA," said Peter Brabeck, chief executive of Nestle.</TE>
<TE>   Nestle, whose ice cream brands include Drumstick and Nestle
Crunch, acquired U.S.-based Haagen-Dazs this year.</TE>
<TE>   Nestle would initially receive 55 million newly issued Dreyer's
shares, boosting its stake to a majority 67% from its 23% holding.
The 55 million Dreyer's shares were worth $2.35 billion at Friday's
closing share price of $42.79.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 2006, Dreyer's shareholders could sell their stock to
Nestle for $83.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, Nestle has the option of scooping up all
outstanding Dreyer's shares for $88 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Dreyer's Chairman and Chief Executive T. Gary Rogers will lead the
combined businesses from Dreyer's home base in Oakland. President
William Cronk will retire once the deal is completed, Dreyer's said.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers and Cronk bought Dreyer's for $1.1 million in 1977, when
the company was operating mainly in California. The former fraternity
brothers at UC Berkeley are credited with taking Dreyer's nationwide
and increasing annual sales more than 200 times. Shares of Dreyers
were first sold to the public in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Dreyer's was founded in 1928 by William Dreyer and Joseph Edy as
an ice cream parlor in Oakland. It invented Rocky Road ice cream a
year later.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers holds about 8% of Dreyer's and Cronk owns about 3.7%,
according to Bloomberg News data. If they sell their shares in 2006,
Rogers and Cronk will net $231.5 million and $107.9 million,
respectively, based on their current holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said it was too early to tell whether any job cuts will
result from the merger.</TE>
<TE>   The new Nestle business will control about 17% of the $25-billion
worldwide market in ice cream, up from Nestle's 13% and matching
Unilever.</TE>
<TE>   The Dreyer's deal gives Nestle access to a prized distribution
system that delivers ice cream from manufacturing plants to stores
without using warehouses.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, expected to result in cost savings of about $170 million
annually by 2005, is expected to close by the end of the year.</TE>

<HD>FCC Combines Ownership Rule Review</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Agency plans proposal by next spring on limits
affecting broadcast, cable and newspaper industries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In response to criticism from Congress and a string of court
setbacks, the Federal Communications Commission said Monday that it
has consolidated the review of numerous media ownership rules and
plans to announce a set of new rules after next spring.</LD>
<LD>   The FCC, which has been struggling to reexamine half a dozen media
rules, also is considering replacing the separate regulations, which
affect the broadcast, cable and newspaper industries, with a single
standard that would apply to all forms of media.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a certain intellectual attraction to a single rule,"
said Ken Ferree, head of the FCC's media bureau, though he cautioned
that no final decision has been made.</LD>
<TE>   The timetable came as a disappointment to some media industry
leaders, who had been hoping for a faster decision, particularly on
the rule that prevents the cross-ownership of television stations and
newspapers in the same market.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not surprising. It's just disappointing," said John Sturm,
president of the American Newspaper Assn., which is lobbying to
strike down the rule. "This seems like yet another delay."</TE>
<TE>   Tribune Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times, is one of the leading
opponents of the ban on cross-ownership of newspapers and TV
stations. Among the media companies that have a waiver on this rule
is Tribune, which owns both a newspaper and TV station in markets
including Los Angeles and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Ferree said a staff recommendation on the rules would be issued by
next spring. Final action by the commissioners, however, may not
happen until next summer, Sturm said.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, the FCC and Chairman Michael K. Powell have been
taking heat from both sides. Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) wrote
Powell this month, urging an expeditious decision on the newspaper
rule. At the same time, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), who opposes
relaxing the newspaper rule, has accused Powell of failing to
thoroughly consider the effect of possible rule changes.</TE>
<TE>   Ferree, who visited Capitol Hill last week to brief leaders about
the issue, said he received support for the new timetable.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to recent federal appeals court rulings that found the
FCC had failed to justify the media rules, Powell has commissioned
more than eight studies to provide the foundation for the FCC's final
ruling. The studies, which will be released for public comment in the
fall, will examine the effect of media ownership on local coverage
and diversity of viewpoints and study how consumers and advertisers
perceive different types of media outlets, such as TV stations, cable
and satellite operators and newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Among the major media rules to be reviewed are the
newspaper-broadcast TV cross-ownership rule; a rule that prohibits a
company from owning TV stations that reach more than 35% of the
national broadcast audience; a "duopoly" rule, which restricts one
company from owning two TV stations in a single market; and the
dual-network rule, which restricts mergers between the major TV
networks.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate proceeding, Ferree said, the FCC will announce a
decision by the end of the year on two cable and pay-TV rules that
were struck down by a federal appeals court last year. One prevents a
cable or pay-TV firm from serving more than 30% of the national
audience, and the other prevents cable operators from owning more
than 40% of the programs they offer.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Verdict Signals New Government Crackdown</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Andersen guilty verdict will prove to be only the first of many
prosecutions in the government's version of a police crackdown on
unethical business practices.</LD>
<LD>   Former executives of Enron Corp. are expected to be charged with
fraud, perjury and obstruction of justice after a federal grand jury
in Houston completes its work. Last week saw the indictment of Tyco
International Ltd.'s chief executive on tax evasion and the arrest of
ImClone Systems Inc.'s founder on suspicion of violating insider
trading laws.</LD>
<LD>   Chief executives of half a dozen companies have lost their jobs in
the last few months, pushed out by boards of directors newly
energized by threats of shareholder lawsuits and calls from prominent
businesspeople for reform of corporate America.</LD>
<TE>   But more is needed. Fired executives walking away with
multimillion-dollar severance packages and sermons from business
leaders are not likely to restore public confidence in U.S. business
and the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   Too much has come out in the last year about shoddy ethics and
dishonest behavior in business, from cheating in the California
energy market to spurious accounting and overstated profits by a
broad swath of U.S. industry.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite numerous disclosures and evidence of investor disgust,
Congress is unlikely to pass legislation governing business because
it is in thrall to business lobbying and dependent on campaign
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   So the shock treatment of government police action will force
reform and change. The aggressive move on Andersen--indicting the
whole company and penalizing thousands of partners and employees--has
been criticized for driving the firm practically out of business. But
it got the attention of the firm and the rest of the accounting
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Recent Securities and Exchange Commission investigations of
disclosure at firms such as Xerox Corp. and Dynegy Inc. typify a new
activism at a regulatory agency that never questioned a single one of
Enron's hundreds of financial filings over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Some substantial reforms are underway. The New York Stock Exchange
is likely to implement new requirements for corporate boards this
summer. Directors will have to be independent of ties to corporate
management and enforce stricter auditing standards and control of
stock options. Any firm not complying with the new requirements would
be delisted.</TE>
<TE>   Ira Millstein, a prominent attorney and expert on directors and
corporations, praised the Big Board's action as a "historic step
forward in promotion of good corporate governance."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Samuel DiPiazza, CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers--the
world's largest accounting firm--called for corporations to adopt
broader and more truthful standards of reporting their condition to
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   But clearly there is division within the accounting profession. A
reform bill that Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, hopes to move to the Senate floor today,
for example, faces strong industry opposition.</TE>
<TE>   That's why government's enforcement powers are needed, even though
police crackdowns can be messy. U.S. business has been here many
times.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of each boom period, distortions and finagling abound.
The roaring '20s were followed by regulation in the '30s, when tough
securities laws were adopted.</TE>
<TE>   But the consequences aren't always so neat. In the late 1980s,
after a decade of unrestrained corporate takeovers financed by
high-yield, or junk, bonds and a misuse of savings and loan
associations, government prosecutions put the firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert out of business and its most important officer, Michael
Milken, in prison.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;Ls were closed and legislatures forbade state agencies from
holding junk bonds. But that led to more unintended consequences than
long-lasting reforms. Wealthy investors and financially astute firms,
such as GE Capital, picked up S&amp;L real estate and junk bonds at
bargain prices and prospered on such holdings through the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Will the results of this new reform period be different? Yes,
reforms of disclosure and corporate governance may well be more
effective because the offenses of the '90s hit directly at so many
Americans. Those corporate offenses lay in overstating profits and
distorting stock markets, in which almost all Americans now have a
stake through corporate and personal pension accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "Lack of business ethics is a long-term threat to U.S. equity
markets," says Robert Arnott of First Quadrant, a Pasadena-based
investment management firm.</TE>
<TE>   But if lack of ethics is a threat, reforms that reinforce a
structure of rules and regulations backed by such government agencies
as the SEC are a guarantor of fair and honest markets.</TE>
<TE>   That guarantee is what the original reforms of the 1930s brought
to U.S. stock and bond markets, which then flourished after World War
II. And that is the hope behind government actions today.</TE>

<HD>Bush Pushes Minority Homeownership</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Monday promoted his campaign to boost homeownership
among minorities, saying he wanted the number of black and Latino
homeowners to increase by at least 5.5 million by the end of the
decade.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, acknowledging he had set "a big goal," said it was
achievable with the help of the private sector.</LD>
<LD>   "When I lay out a goal, I mean it," Bush told several hundred
people at Atlanta's St. Paul AME Church, which is located in a
once-dilapidated, crime-infested neighborhood where a surge in home
building has led to improvements.</LD>
<TE>   Bush wants to close the gap in homeownership rates between whites
and minorities, particularly blacks and Latinos. The nation's overall
homeownership rate is at an all-time high of nearly 68%, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development said. But whereas nearly
three-quarters of all white Americans own their homes, less than half
of all African Americans and Latinos do.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's got to change for the good of the country," Bush said.
"And I believe those of us who have been given positions of
responsibility must do everything we can to spotlight the [American]
dream and to make sure the dream shines in all neighborhoods, all
throughout our country."</TE>
<TE>   In his current budget, Bush is seeking nearly $2.4 billion in tax
credits for developers to help spur the rehabilitation or new
construction of up to 200,000 homes for purchase by low-income
households.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also wants Congress to approve $200 million a year in grants
that would help low-income families buy their first homes. Most
grants would be less than $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Bush stressed that while government does its part, the real estate
and mortgage-finance industries must join in the push to increase
homeownership among minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Lennar Corp., Centex Corp. and other U.S. homebuilders
rose after his announcement.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's SuperCap Homebuilding index rose 9.08
points, or 2.7%, to 339.91. The index was led by Lennar, whose shares
rose $2.10 to $55.50; NVR Inc., which gained $14.50 to $334; and
Centex, which rose $1.48 to $53.65.</TE>

<LD>Marriott International Inc., the largest U.S. hotel company, sold a
hotel in New Jersey and one in California to CNL Hospitality Corp.
for about $143 million.</LD>
<LD>   The company sold a 347-room Marriott in Bridgewater, N.J., and a
405-room Courtyard in San Francisco, it said in an announce- ment.
Marriott will keep a stake in the San Francisco hotel and will
operate both hotels under long-term management agreements.</LD>
<LD>   Bethesda, Md.-based Marriott has sold about $300 million in assets

<HD>Health Insurance Rate Hikes Expected</HD>
<DH>Poll: UCLA survey finds more employers plan to shift the
burden of rising premiums to workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an early look at what health insurance will cost in 2003, a new
national survey by UCLA shows that many employers are expecting rate
hikes of 20% or more and are preparing to make substantial changes in
health plans to shift more of the burden of rising premiums to
workers.</LD>
<LD>   Some employers already have begun to make changes such as raising
co-payments and deductibles or reducing the level of health benefits.
But the pace appears to be quickening, according to the UCLA survey,
which is being released today.</LD>
<LD>   "We're changing from an era where companies sucked up the
increases to where they're going to pass [them] on to employees,"
said Chris Thornberg, a senior economist at the UCLA Anderson
Forecast, which conducted the poll of 460 employers. "They view this
as just the beginning."</LD>
<TE>   Just about all of the respondents to the survey said they were
expecting health premiums to jump by double-digit percentages in the
coming year. One out of four employers said it was bracing for an
increase of 20% or more.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, about 75% of the managers polled said they were
somewhat or very likely to substantially revise their health plans
when annual renewals come up.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's findings are consistent with other recent reports from
consultants that suggest health care will be even more costly for
employers than previously expected. This month, Hewitt Associates
said insurance firms are demanding HMO premium increases of more than
20% for 2003, compared with an average rise of 15% for this year.
Hewitt's survey noted that employees are being asked to pay more out
of pocket for prescription drugs, which have been a major contributor
to the inflation.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's survey included small and large employers across a broad
spectrum of industries. Most big employers are now only beginning to
negotiate with insurers and decide plan options for the upcoming
year. But a lot of smaller businesses have already received their
annual renewal rates.</TE>
<TE>   Garry Angelotti, owner of VTS Inc., a medical equipment service
firm in Santa Clarita, got his new company health insurance bill last
month. It jumped 45% from a year ago, to $2,925 a month. Angelotti
has 10 employees, and his company is unusual in that it pays 100% of
employee insurance premiums.</TE>
<TE>   But Angelotti said he can't keep that up for long. To pay for the
higher premiums, he has raised prices for service and parts. But even
that isn't enough. "There's only so much money in the till," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most businesses, however, can't raise prices because of the
competition and tough economy, said Steve Richter, a senior
health-care benefits consultant at Watson Wyatt Worldwide in
Universal City. "They've got to pass a lot of the costs to
employees," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Eva Wang, an insurance broker in San Gabriel who specializes in
small-group policies, said her clients are seeing 10% to 30% premium
increases. So far, she said, no one has dropped coverage. But some
have boosted deductibles and switched from a regular HMO to a cheaper
plan with fewer benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "I see downgrading," said Wang, who has more than 1,000 individual
and small-business clients.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's Thornberg said such widespread action is a huge shift from
the late 1980s and early 1990s, when employers largely absorbed the
cost increases before HMOs took hold.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's survey, however, showed employers were in no rush to switch
to so-called defined contribution plans, in which businesses give
their employees a set amount of cash to buy health insurance
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts had predicted these plans would proliferate soon,
but only 15% of the respondents to UCLA's poll said they were likely
to take that route. Analysts said employers are hesitant to offer
these plans because of tax consequences and the uncertainties of
leaving it up to employees to buy private medical coverage, which
typically is more expensive.</TE>

<HD>Rally on Wall Street Continues</HD>
<DH>Stocks: The Dow surges 213.21 points, or 2.3%, as investors
seek bargains after four weeks of losses. Nasdaq jumps 3.2%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street on Monday extended the rebound of late last week, as
bargain hunters sought out technology and financial issues and pushed
major market indexes to their best day in more than a month.</LD>
<LD>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index has fallen in 11 of the last 13
weeks, bringing stock prices down to attractive levels given the
slowly improving economy, strategists said.</LD>
<LD>   "After weeks of selling, the selling pressure has dried up" at
least for the moment, said Robert Arancio, head of Nasdaq trading for
Lehman Bros. "People are more comfortable on a value perspective to
buy and hold. They're starting to look past 2002 and look forward
into 2003."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average surged 213.21 points, or 2.3%, to
9,687.42. The broader S&amp;P 500 jumped 28.90 points, or 2.9%, to
1,036.17. It was the biggest one-day gain for both since May 8.</TE>
<TE>   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 48.55 points,
or 3.2%, to 1,553.29, its best one-day gain since May 14.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by more than 2 to 1 on Nasdaq and the New York
Stock Exchange. But trading, though active, was below last week's
levels when volume surged amid heavy selling.</TE>
<TE>   Financial stocks led the rally, with Citigroup up $2.63 to $42.83
and J.P. Morgan Chase advancing $2.48 to $35.48. Lehman Bros., which
is expected to report quarterly profit results today, rose $2.81 to
$62.65.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors like these names because they're inexpensive and they
have, on a long-term basis, a positive outlook," said John Lyons,
president of Keefe Managers.</TE>
<TE>   Among battered tech stocks, Texas Instruments rose $1.24 to
$26.64, Intel recovered $1.28 to $22.56 and Cisco Systems gained 77
cents to $15.07.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's rally prolonged a rebound that began late Friday when the
Dow erased most of an early 241-point plunge and the S&amp;P 500, which
had fallen to its lowest since the aftermath of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, closed down less than 3 points.</TE>
<TE>   Although the follow-through Monday was encouraging, analysts
warned that the market has failed to hold previous surges. From May 7
to May 17, the S&amp;P 500 rallied almost 6% before tumbling anew.</TE>
<TE>   Some pros said they aren't aggressively buying yet because several
clouds still cast a shadow, such as geopolitical turmoil, questions
over corporate America's accounting and lackluster earnings overall.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take much good news to give us a one-day rally in the
market, but for this to convince money managers to start putting
money back in, we need to see this continue for two or three days,"
said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist for State Street Global
Advisors.</TE>
<TE>   With investors snapping up equities, safe-haven investments such
as gold retreated. The Amex index of gold stocks fell 5%, reflecting
losses in stocks such as Newmont Mining, down $1.46 to $27.50, and
Goldcorp, off 76 cents to $9.65.</TE>
<TE>   Also, bond yields rose for the first time in six trading sessions
as investors moved money from bonds into stocks. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed to 4.84% from 4.80% on
Friday. The dollar gained against the euro and yen.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Among blue chips, McDonald's rose 70 cents to $29.82 after
saying it expects quarterly earnings to exceed forecasts as the
benefits of a weaker dollar more than offset soft sales. Other
multinational winners in the Dow included Boeing, up $1.47 to $44,
and Procter &amp; Gamble, up $2.35 to $93.90.</TE>
<TE>   * European markets, which plunged during Friday's early sell-off
in the U.S., rebounded. Among major bourses, Germany climbed 4%,
France gained 4.4% and Britain rose 2.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Energy stocks rose with oil prices, which gained 15 cents to
$26.09 a barrel in New York trading after a warning from Iraq that
crude exports may stop because of U.N. delays in approving sale
prices. ExxonMobil rose 88 cents to $40.03. The Philadelphia oil
field services index added 2.8%.</TE>

<HD>Punitive Phase Starts in Genentech Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fresh from their $300-million compensatory award victory last week,
attorneys for City of Hope National Medical Center urged jurors
Monday to punish Genentech Inc. for its "reprehensible behavior" in
depriving the Duarte-based hospital of royalties.</LD>
<LD>   In opening arguments in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
attorney Morgan Chu did not specify how much City of Hope was seeking
in the punitive-damages portion of the trial.</LD>
<LD>   A jury last week found that Genentech acted with malice or fraud
in failing to honor a 1976 contract, which produced the first biotech
drug, human insulin.</LD>
<TE>   Chu called on the jurors to "be the conscience of the community"
and to weigh the South San Francisco biotech company's substantial
wealth, noting twice its $5.8-billion net worth.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a mind-boggling number," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech's attorney, Susan Harriman, said in her opening
statement that the $300-million award was punishment enough.</TE>
<TE>   She told the jurors to consider that some of Genentech's key
executives early on were no longer with the firm. "No amount of
punitive damages can change the conduct of those persons," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In pretrial motions earlier in the day, Harriman sought to bar
City of Hope from presenting evidence of "reprehensible behavior" in
the punitive-damages phase of the trial. Judge Edward Kakita denied
that motion.</TE>
<TE>   But Kakita also ruled that City of Hope could not present
speculative testimony about what might have happened with research or
other activities if the hospital had received the unpaid royalties
from Genentech. Because of that ruling, City of Hope is likely to
withdraw some witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The punitive-damages part is expected to proceed swiftly, lasting
perhaps a couple more days.</TE>
<TE>   There is no cap on what jurors can award in punitive damages, but
attorneys say the amounts should be in relation to the compensatory
damages and not jeopardize the survival of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Genentech rose $2.32 on Monday to $34.85 on the Big
Board.</TE>

<HD>DRA Buys 5 San Diego Office Buildings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DRA Advisors Inc. bought five San Diego office buildings from Clarion
Partners for about $80 million, the largest office property
transaction in San Diego County this year.</LD>
<LD>   The buildings are in four suburban locations, said Rick Putnam, a
principal with Trammell Crow Co., which represented Clarion in the
sale. The buildings contain a total of 477,756 square feet and are
93% occupied.</LD>
<LD>   DRA was attracted to San Diego by a vacancy rate of 7.5%, the
growth of biotechnology and defense-related companies and constraints
on new supply, Putnam said. The vacancy rate nationally is almost
12%, according to CB Richard Ellis.</LD>
<TE>   DRA, a New York-based investment advisory firm, purchased the
buildings in partnership with Landmark Asset Management Group.
Clarion is a pension fund advisor.</TE>

<HD>Pasha Plans 700-Acre Facility</HD>
<DH>Transportation: The airport complex will handle containers,

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans for a 700-acre distribution complex at the Southern California
Logistics Airport in Victorville will be announced today by Pasha
Group, a Corte Madera-based transportation company.</LD>
<LD>   The facility at the former George Air Force base will handle
storage, maintenance and repair of containers, chassis and other
transport equipment, such as rail freight cars or locomotives.</LD>
<LD>   Pasha also plans to build warehousing and processing facilities
for foreign auto manufacturers. New vehicles will be prepared there
for dealers across the United States.</LD>
<TE>   The new complex will free up space at the ports of Long Beach and
Los Angeles, where as much as 40% of the land is now occupied by
container and automotive storage, a Pasha spokesman said. The complex
will be linked to the ports by rail through a connection with the
recently completed Alameda Corridor.</TE>
<TE>   The first containers are expected to relocate in the fall. Pasha
plans to employ 200 people at the complex, which will be built over
several years at a cost of $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Logistics Airport is a 5,000-acre business
complex that includes manufacturing, industrial and office facilities
along with an international airport. It has been designated a Foreign
Trade Zone.</TE>
<TE>   BAE Systems, a British aerospace and defense contractor, has an
aircraft maintenance and modification operation at the former air
base. Other businesses include Pratt &amp; Whitney, Boeing Capital,
Goodyear and M&amp;M/Mars Corp.</TE>

<HD>Rothbart to Buy Inglewood Site</HD>
<DH>Development: Plans call for a shopping center at the
60-acre site adjacent to Hollywood Park Race Track.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shopping center developer Rothbart Development Corp. said Monday that
it had agreed to buy about 60 acres of land adjacent to Hollywood
Park Race Track in Inglewood for $36 million and plans to build a
retail project on the site.</LD>
<LD>   Rothbart has 12 months to secure city approvals and entitlements
to build the center to complete the purchase of land from
Glendale-based Pinnacle Entertainment Inc., which operates and owns
casinos and card clubs. The firm is selling its non-gaming property
to raise funds to develop a riverboat casino on Lake Charles, La.,
according to industry observers.</LD>
<LD>   Pinnacle Entertainment has tried twice in recent years to sell the
property.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, the sale of the land to apartment developer Alan Casden
fell apart. Casden had initially agreed to buy the site in April 2000
shortly after a deal to sell the land to home builder K. Hovnanian
Cos. of California failed to materialize.</TE>
<TE>   Pinnacle still owns 37 acres of property in the area.</TE>
<TE>   A statement issued by the companies said that Santa Monica-based
Rothbart, a privately held developer, plans to build a shopping
center "featuring national chain retail stores" but did not reveal
any details.</TE>
<TE>   Rothbart, which was founded in 1985, has developed more than 70
community shopping centers across Southern California with more than
8 million square feet of retail space.</TE>
<TE>   "This project will represent the largest single development in our
history," said Inglewood Mayor Roosevelt Dorn.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to working closely with the Rothbart group to
secure the necessary entitlements for development of the property,"
he said</TE>
<TE>   Pinnacle Entertainment Chairman Daniel R. Lee said his firm will
now focus on its 37 remaining acres in Inglewood but did not provide
any specific plans for the property.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange Monday, Pinnacle Entertainment
shares rose 18 cents to $9.83.</TE>
<TE>   Pinnacle, formerly known as Hollywood Park Inc., sold the
Hollywood Park horse-racing track in 1999 for about $140 million to
race-track operator Churchill Downs Inc.</TE>

<HD>New Qwest CEO Has Reputation as Asset Seller</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc.'s new chief executive will
take control of efforts to sell the company's yellow-pages unit to
avoid a loan default--and he might not stop there, analysts said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Notebaert, who replaced ousted CEO Joseph Nacchio over the
weekend, may sell other assets and pare expenses at Qwest, the
biggest local telephone company in 14 Western states.</LD>
<LD>   "He may [have been] brought in to sell the whole kit and
caboodle," said Terry Barnich, who runs New Paradigm Resources Group,
a Chicago research firm whose customers include Qwest.</LD>
<TE>   Notebaert developed a reputation as a cost cutter and asset seller
as CEO of two other prominent telecommunications firms, Tellabs Inc.
and Ameritech Corp. At Tellabs, Notebaert slashed about 40% of the
work force. The telecommunications equipment maker's shares fell 84%
on his watch.</TE>
<TE>   At Ameritech, Notebaert was "very cost-conscious, very
bottom-line-oriented, which is not a bad thing these days," said Ray
Romero, former general counsel of Ameritech's international division
and now general counsel for ATSI Communications Inc., a phone company
in San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   During Notebaert's five years as CEO of Ameritech, the company's
financial performance was better than that of rivals, Jefferies &amp; Co.
analyst Richard Klugman wrote in a research note.</TE>
<TE>   Notebaert guided the Chicago-based local phone company's
$80.6-billion sale to SBC Communications Inc. in 1999 before joining
Tellabs in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Nacchio, who joined Qwest in 1997, had been trying to sell the
company's yellow-pages unit, a business valued by analysts at as much
as $10 billion. He was negotiating with potential buyers and had said
a final decision would be made by mid-July. Notebaert probably will
complete that transaction, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got deep experience on a number of levels, both on the local
phone business and also from the equipment side," Jeff Kagan, an
independent telecommunications analyst in Atlanta, said of Notebaert.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Denver-based Qwest rose 85 cents to $5 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>McDonald's Corp., the world's largest restaurant chain, said
second-quarter profit will rise after six quarterly declines as
European sales rose and the euro gained against the dollar.</LD>
<LD>   Profit will be 38 cents or 39 cents a share, compared with 34
cents a year earlier, McDonald's said. The average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call was 37 cents.</LD>
<LD>   Sales increased 9% in Europe in the first two months of the
quarter, excluding the effect of currencies, as consumer concerns
about "mad-cow" disease eased, McDonald's said.</LD>
<TE>   The euro has gained about 3.7% in the last year, boosting results
when reported in dollars. Europe is McDonald's second-biggest market
after the U.S., generating about a third of sales.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of McDonald's rose 70 cents to $29.82 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Madison Dearborn Partners Inc., a leveraged buyout firm, has agreed
to buy Jefferson Smurfit Group for $3.5 billion, its fifth takeover
of a packaging company and its biggest investment.</LD>
<LD>   The takeover would be the latest purchase of a paper company by an
acquisition firm betting that profit will grow as the economy
expands. Dublin, Ireland-based Jefferson Smurfit would make
Chicago-based Madison Dearborn the world's biggest producer of
container board, used to make boxes and packaging.</LD>
<LD>   Madison had bought Riverwood Holding Inc., Bay State Paper Holding
Co. and Buckeye Cellulose Corp. It acquired a majority stake in the
container-board and corrugated-packaging business of Tenneco Inc. in
1999 and took it public as Pactiv Corp. the following year.</LD>

<LD>Starbucks Corp. pulled a promotional poster from more than 3,000
retail outlets over concerns the picture of drinks side by side might
inappropriately recall the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The posters show two tea drinks with a dragonfly hovering to the
left and the slogan "Collapse Into Cool."</LD>
<LD>   Starbucks pulled the posters June 7 after being contacted by a New
York Post reporter investigating a reader's complaint. The company
said it had intended no link between the image of the beverages and
the terror attacks.</LD>

cash for each share held, was increased to $13.50. Morton's and New
York-based Castle Harlan, Morton's former owner, also agreed to
eliminate part of the agreement that would have required Morton's to
achieve a minimum level of earnings.</LD>

<LD>   The auction of two-year notes had been scheduled for June 26.
Settlement, when the successful bidders pay for new securities, was
scheduled for July 1.</LD>
<LD>   Treasury officials said they still hoped that the July 1
settlement date can be maintained even if the date of the actual
auction slips from June 26.</LD>

<LD>Taco Bell Corp., in an ongoing effort to shed its image as a place
for little more than low-priced food, is rolling out a chicken bowl
later this week and a steak bowl next month. The company plans to
spend $35 million over 12 weeks to advertise the premium
products--its most expensive campaign ever for new menu items.</LD>
<LD>   Taco Bell recently unveiled several upscale products, including
chicken and steak quesadillas and grilled stuffed burritos. The
Irvine firm wants to offer products at the speed of fast food but
with the taste of more upscale fast-casual chains, President Emil J.
Brolick said.</LD>

<HD>Southwest Plans New Boarding System</HD>
<DH>Airlines: The colored plastic cards, long used by the
low-fare carrier and considered one of its quirks, will be replaced
with paper passes. Open-seating policy remains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southwest Airlines is retiring a waxy piece of airline history:
plastic boarding cards.</LD>
<LD>   The low-fare carrier, which doesn't have assigned seating, is
phasing out the reusable colored cards that have been a staple of the
airline since its founding three decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next two weeks, Southwest will shift to an automated
system in which passengers will get a paper boarding pass at the
ticket counter or at other locations in the airport.</LD>
<TE>   Flying Southwest always has been first come, first seated. That
means that travelers must stand in line at the boarding gate to get a
numbered plastic boarding card. Travelers then wait for gate
personnel to call the 30-passenger group that includes their boarding
number.</TE>
<TE>   The cards are one of the quirks that sets Southwest apart from
other carriers, and over the years, tens of millions of passengers
have endured the ritual and fidgeted with the cards as they waited to
board. Some also used the rectangular cards as a bookmark,
flyswatter, back scratcher, face fan, a writing surface and,
according to Southwest, as a toothpick. The cards also have the name
of their color printed on the back, for the colorblind.</TE>
<TE>   But with increased security and long lines at the airport since
Sept. 11, waiting in yet one more line for the boarding card became
too much of a nuisance, Southwest concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "We've not changed our open-seating policy, and we will still
board in groups based on when the customer checks in," Dave Ridley,
Southwest's vice president of ground operations, said in a statement.
But now passengers "will stand in only one line, excluding security,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new system, Southwest passengers can check in either at
the ticket counter, skycap counter or the boarding gate, where
they'll be issued a paper boarding pass--much like any other airline.
But the pass also will show a letter--A, B or C--which is the
airline's new way of dividing its passengers into three groups. Those
with the letter A will go first.</TE>
<GT></GT>
<CP>PHOTO: Increased security means more waiting in line at
airports, so Southwest Airlines has decided to eliminate one line for
its passengers.</CP>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp., facing a sales shortfall, may have to announce soon that
its earnings for the second quarter won't meet expectations, Salomon
Smith Barney analyst Richard Gardner said.</LD>
<LD>   Gardner cut his 2002 earnings estimate for the world's largest
computer maker to $3.85 a share from $4.11 while leaving his 2003
estimate of $4.75 unchanged.</LD>
<LD>   On average, analysts expect IBM to earn $4.07 this year and $4.81
in 2003, according to Thomson First Call.</LD>
<TE>   For the first quarter, IBM warned that profit would fall below
analyst forecasts, less than two weeks before reporting its results
on April 17.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner said a pre-earnings announcement from IBM is unlikely
until late this month or early July.</TE>
<TE>   IBM shares rose 97 cents to $77.14 on the Big Board.</TE>

<HD>Loudcloud to Sell Main Business to EDS</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In another sign of the high-tech industry's humbling times, Web
browser pioneer Marc Andreessen abandoned his ambition to build a Web
services giant and agreed to sell most of his latest brainchild,
Loudcloud Inc., to computer systems consultant Electronic Data
Systems Corp.</LD>
<LD>   EDS will pay $63.5 million in cash for Loudcloud's primary
business of managing and developing Web sites for other companies.</LD>
<LD>   Plano, Texas-based EDS also agreed to pay $52 million during the
next three years to use a Loudcloud product called Opsware--software
meant to automate information technology departments. Loudcloud is
changing its name to Opsware in an effort to survive as a much
smaller company.</LD>
<TE>   The deal represents a small fraction of the $306 million that
Andreessen and Loudcloud's other co-founders have raised from
investors since starting the company in September 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Loudcloud rose 36 cents to $1.99
on Nasdaq. EDS rose $1.16 to $49.10 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd., the biggest fiber-optic network provider to

<HD>Market Indicators Sending Mixed Signals</HD>
<DH>Outlook: Analysts continue to watch 'technicals' to see
where stock prices may be headed longer term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street analysts looking at the stock market's chart patterns and
other "technical" indicators say they aren't getting clear signals as
to whether the latest sell-off has run its course.</LD>
<LD>   Although pessimism among investment newsletter writers, for
example, is on the rise, it remains far below the extreme readings
that "contrarian" analysts look for as a sign that the market may
have reached a near-term bottom--as it did in mid-September, before
rallying strongly in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, analysts say there isn't enough evidence that
sellers have exhausted themselves, paving the way for buyers to come
in and fuel a sustained rally.</LD>
<TE>   "We have not seen true capitulation by investors," said Chris
Johnson, an analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.
"Across the board, I'm just seeing complacency, not fear."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bob Dickey, managing director at brokerage RBC Dain Rauscher
in Minneapolis: "The problem is that technical indicators, just like
the fundamental ones, are mixed. You could argue either a bearish or
bullish case for the market right now, depending on your point of
view."</TE>
<TE>   In technical parlance, the market got "oversold" by last week,
after four straight weekly declines in key indexes. That paved the
way for a short-term rally that began midday Friday, picked up steam
Monday and could continue through this week, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts still are watching several indicators for stronger
signals about where the market may be headed longer term, including:</TE>
<TE>   * Investor sentiment surveys. Technical analysts look to sentiment
surveys for signs of extreme bullishness or extreme bearishness among
investors. Such extremes often foreshadow a market reversal. In
September, bears outnumbered bulls in a weekly survey of market
newsletter editors taken by Investors Intelligence newsletter--a
rarity that coincided with the market's low after the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Investors Intelligence poll results, for the week ended
June 7, showed pessimism about U.S. stocks at the highest since Sept.
28. Still, bullish newsletter editors outnumbered bearish ones, 42.9%
to 34.7%. (The remainder aren't bullish or bearish but rather expect
a modest pullback in stocks from current levels, at worst.)</TE>
<TE>   For market contrarians, those results are headed in the right
direction, as the bullish sentiment reading as of June 7 fell 6
percentage points from the previous week.</TE>
<TE>   One survey that may give contrarian analysts more encouragement is
the weekly poll of members of the American Assn. of Individual
Investors. Last week's results show bearishness outpolling
bullishness, 34.6% to 31.8%. In the AAII poll, bullishness is off its
recent peak of 56.5% in March, but pessimism is less extreme than it
was in mid-September, when the survey showed 26.7% of members bullish
and 36.7% bearish.</TE>
<TE>   * Put-call ratio. This compares the number of bearish ("put")
stock options to bullish ("call") options bought on the Chicago Board
Options Exchange on a given day. Options are contracts that allow an
investor to make a leveraged bet on the direction of an underlying
stock or index. A put is an option to sell an underlying security at
a certain price, and a call is a similar option to buy.</TE>
<TE>   Some technical analysts look for extreme spikes in the put-call
ratio as a sign that the market might be oversold and due for at
least a short-term bounce. In late September, for example, the CBOE's
equity put-call ratio rose to a 52-week high of 1.20. That coincided
with the market's bottom.</TE>
<TE>   By late January, after a fourth-quarter stock price run-up, the
ratio had fallen to a 52-week low of 0.38 as bearish bets dwindled.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the ratio has been inching higher, and by Friday it had
reached 0.92 (highest since Feb. 15), before backing off to 0.60 on
Monday. Last week's levels were seen as encouraging from a contrarian
standpoint but far from extreme, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   *  Advance-decline lines. Analysts look at the advance-decline
lines on Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange to get a snapshot of
the market's overall health. The A-D lines are calculated daily as
the number of stocks rising minus the number falling. So an upward
trend indicates a broad market advance. A downward slope indicates
spreading market weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Major market indexes such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the
Nasdaq composite are weighted by market capitalization, meaning the
biggest stocks dominate. The A-D lines, by contrast, present an
"equally weighted picture" of the market, as Dickey put it.</TE>
<TE>   The A-D lines had been advancing this year until early May,
belying the losses in the major indexes. But since early May, the A-D
lines have been trending lower, though they remain well above their
September lows. Continued deterioration in the A-D lines would be a
bearish indicator.</TE>
<TE>   * Trading volume. A spike in equity trading volume late last week,
coinciding with the intraday plunge, then sharp recovery in the
market averages Friday, was seen as potentially positive by some
analysts. That's because bear markets sometimes end with climactic
sell-offs.</TE>
<TE>   But the volume trend continued sending mixed signals Monday,
analysts said. Bill Ryder, quantitative strategist at Wachovia
Securities in Richmond, Va., noted that though Monday's market
breadth was impressive, with stocks of varying size, sectors and
growth or value characteristics rising, trading volume was modest,
especially on Nasdaq. "You'd rather see a much more impressive
follow-through kind of rally," Ryder said.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Marder, L.A.-based market strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann
Asset Management, agreed. "There wasn't any urgency [Monday] for
investors to jump in there before the train leaves the station," he
said.</TE>

<HD>IRS Can Estimate Tip Income, Justices Rule</HD>
<DH>Litigation: High court disagrees with restaurant industry
on how to determine Social Security taxes. Analysts say decision
could prompt higher prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SAVAGE and MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court dealt restaurant owners a tax defeat Monday,
ruling that the Internal Revenue Service can use an estimate of tips
received by servers and bartenders when determining tax bills.</LD>
<LD>   The decision could lead to bills for back taxes throughout the
restaurant industry. The ruling also could affect other industries in
which employees receive tip income, experts said.</LD>
<LD>   The decision also could help the IRS collect more tax from tipped
employees, if it results in restaurants requiring employees to more
accurately report their individual tip incomes. Employees typically
underreport such income to their employers.</LD>
<TE>   Upscale restaurants could be hit the hardest, given their larger
tip revenues, analysts said. It may cause some to raise prices or lay
off employees, and could give an advantage to fast-food and
fast-casual outlets that don't collect tip income, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be very painful for many restaurants and cause
lots of headaches," said Hal Sieling, a restaurant consultant in
Carlsbad, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   The National Restaurant Assn., a Washington-based industry
lobbying group, said the ruling could push struggling operators into
insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   But others painted a much less grim scenario. Richard Martin,
managing editor of Nation's Restaurant News, said the new method for
calculating employees' taxable income would add only pennies to the
typical meal.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't going to send consumers running from restaurants or
destroy the industry," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-3 ruling upholds a move by federal tax collectors to force
employers to pay the 7.65% Social Security tax on all income received
by their workers, including tips.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute arose over how to calculate the total tip income.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, restaurant owners were told they could rely on
reports from their servers and bartenders.</TE>
<TE>   But tips were notoriously underreported. In the early 1990s, the
IRS said it would look at credit card slips to calculate how much
waiters and waitresses were actually receiving. Then, it would use
the average tip to estimate the total of tips.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if customers on average added a 15% tip on their
credit cards, the IRS would assume that customers tipped 15% on all
of the restaurant's income, including cash payments. The owner could
be assessed back taxes based on this amount.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant industry cried foul. Customers who pay in cash
often leave lower tips, its lawyers said. Sometimes, waiters are
stiffed and receive no tip, a lawyer for a San Francisco restaurant
told the high court.</TE>
<TE>   But on Monday, the justices brushed aside those complaints and
upheld the estimates based on credit card receipts as a reasonable
way to assess the taxes owed by a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   The owner of Fior d'Italia, which proclaims itself as San
Francisco's oldest Italian restaurant, challenged the estimates after
receiving a tax bill for 1991 and 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS estimated the tips for 1992 as $368,374, not the $220,845
that the servers had reported. The IRS sent the owner an $11,286 bill
for back taxes for 1992 to cover his share of the employee Social
Security taxes. They are known officially as the Federal Insurance
Contribution Act, or FICA, taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Unquestionably, restaurant owners are free to challenge the
accuracy of their tax assessments, said Justice Stephen G. Breyer.
But these quibbles do not show "the aggregate estimate method is an
unreasonable way of ascertaining unpaid FICA taxes for which the
employer is indisputably liable," Breyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the National Restaurant Assn., which represents 200,000
eating establishments, denounced the decision and said they would
take their fight to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "This is grossly unfair, and it has a potentially huge financial
impact," said Peter Kilgore, the group's general counsel.</TE>
<TE>   He and others also said the ruling may affect all employers--such
as hotels, casinos and taxi companies--whose employees receive tips.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's decision is particularly bad news for California's
eateries, which are already struggling with the nation's
second-highest minimum wage, rapidly increasing workers compensation
costs and high real estate and utility costs, said Randall Hiatt,
president of Fessel International, a Costa Mesa restaurant consulting
firm.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just another jab," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Culver City, Pacifico's stands to lose thousands of dollars a
year because of the new method for calculating workers' taxable
income, said Howdy Kabrins, co-owner of the year-old Latin seafood
restaurant. Having just raised prices 10% to 12% because of rising
halibut and shrimp wholesale costs, he said he would have to raise
them again or lay off employees.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, Hiatt said, the ruling would have the effect of adding
about 0.4% to restaurants' costs. To counteract that, some
restaurants probably will raise prices or scale back hours, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other Southern California eateries reacted to the ruling with
worry and panic. Eddie Kerkhofs, owner of Le Dome in West Hollywood,
said he probably would have to raise prices at his posh restaurant.
With business already down 15% because of the turbulent economy,
decline in business travelers and a slump in the music industry, he
fears that taking such a step might hurt business.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to try to digest this, but it's like eating rat poison
or contaminated food," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Across town in Santa Monica, the 4-month-old Union Restaurant &amp;
Bar has been doing a brisk business by offering hearty American fare
at a moderate price.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the ruling, Union's owners have begun discussing a
price hike, a move that could diminish the bistro's appeal as a place
for good value, said managing partner Chuck Craig. "If we raise our
prices too high, we might price ourselves out of our market," Craig
said. "We want to be a place where people come four times a month,
not four times a year."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Larive, owner of Fior d'Italia, said he challenged the back
assessment to show the unfairness of the IRS policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We hoped a decision in our favor would force the IRS to do their
job the right way and not resort to threats and guesses to coerce
taxes out of restaurants and employees," Larive said. However, an IRS
lawyer stressed that the "aggregate estimate" method has not been
widely used so far. Moreover, it is used only when it appears
restaurants are underpaying their taxes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti praised the decision and said
it "upholds our ability to make sure all Americans pay a fair share
of taxes. The IRS plans to continue working cooperatively with the
restaurant industry and other industries were tips are common."</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco restaurant won rulings in its favor from a
federal judge there and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge
Alex Kozinski said the IRS was not empowered to "slap an employer"
with back tax assessments based on "rough and somewhat inflated
estimates."</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. Solicitor General Ted Olson appealed the issue to the
high court. He noted that the amount of reported tips to the IRS rose
from $8.5 billion in 1994 to $14.3 billion in 1999 after the tax
agency pressed for better compliance. This suggests tip income was
greatly underreported, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Breyer's opinion reversing the 9th Circuit and upholding the IRS
was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John
Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg.</TE>
<TE>   Dissenting, Justice David H. Souter said the estimates look to be
inaccurate, and they "broadly saddle employers with a burden
unintended by Congress." Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas

<HD>Tyco Sues Former Officials</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd. sued former director Frank E. Walsh Jr. and
ex-general counsel Mark Belnick, alleging they received millions of
dollars in compensation the board didn't approve.</LD>
<LD>   In separate complaints filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
Tyco said Walsh arranged and hid a $20-million "finder's fee" related
to the purchase of CIT Group Inc. last year. The company alleged that
Belnick, who was fired last week, got $35 million in unauthorized
compensation.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuits are the first actions related to an internal probe
into the misuse of funds by ousted Chief Executive Dennis Kozlowski.
Tyco, the largest maker of undersea fiber-optic cable and electrical
connectors, has lost more than $80 billion in market value this year
because of questions about its accounting accuracy and business
strategy.</LD>
<TE>   Belnick's attorney, Stanley Arkin, called the suit "an effort at a
legal mugging." A spokesman for Walsh said the suit against the
former director was an "overreaction."</TE>
<TE>   The suits link Walsh and Belnick with Kozlowski, who was indicted
for sales-tax evasion.</TE>
<TE>   "Belnick's fortunes were, quite literally, linked to Kozlowski's
in a way that neither the board, the compensation committee, the
company's personnel department, nor the public ever knew," the suit
against Belnick alleges.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco cited a memo from Belnick's personnel file in which Kozlowski
promises that Belnick's yearly bonus won't be less than one-third of
Kozlowski's.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco also said that Belnick received a $14-million no-interest
loan used to buy homes.</TE>
<TE>   Arkin said the allegations are baseless. "[Belnick's] an honest
guy with a terrific reputation," he said. "The focus should be on the
board and what that board did wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Tyco alleged that Walsh hid the payment from the board and later
refused to return it. In a statement released by a spokesman, Walsh
said he brokered the CIT acquisition and his fee at Kozlowski's
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Bermuda-based Tyco closed up 69 cents at $14.09 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi to Trim Stake in French Water Utility</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking to ease investor fears over its soaring debt, Vivendi
Universal's board of directors agreed Monday to scale back its
investment in a 149-year-old water utility that was once its core
business.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, media giant Vivendi Universal will reduce its
ownership in Vivendi Environnement from 63% to slightly more than
40%, partly by selling $1.8 billion worth of its shares to a group of
French investors as soon as market conditions are "appropriate."
Vivendi Environnement, which is separately traded and operates the
world's largest water services company, also will sell $1.3 billion
worth of shares.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi Universal said it will use proceeds from the utility sale
to lower its debt. In addition, by reducing its stake below 50%,
under U.S. accounting rules Vivendi no longer will have to include
the $13 billion in debt from the utility on its balance sheet.</LD>
<TE>   The strategy represents a change for Vivendi Universal Chief
Executive Jean-Marie Messier, who told shareholders at the company's
annual meeting in April that such plans were "not on the agenda."</TE>
<TE>   But Messier has since come under pressure from board members and
investors to lower the company's debt, which ballooned to $30 billion
over the last three years as he transformed a sleepy French water
utility into the world's second-largest media company through several
major acquisitions, including Universal Studios.</TE>
<TE>   As part of Messier's plan to slash its debt, Vivendi agreed Friday
to sell half of a Norwegian pay-TV unit for $274 million. Vivendi
also has announced plans to sell an Italian pay-TV firm to News Corp.
and is reportedly close to selling its Canal Plus Technologies unit.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and investors, who have been confused about Messier's
plans for the water business, welcomed the board's decision Monday.
Vivendi's American depositary receipts rose $1.86 to $28.51 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "This paves the way for the company to reduce its crushing debt
load and lessen its focus on the utility business," said George
Nichols, a media analyst with MorningStar Inc. in Chicago. "[Vivendi]
has been trying to position itself as a media and communications
company, but investors don't see the company in the same way because
half of its revenue comes from the water business."</TE>

<HD>Wynn Files IPO Plan for New Las Vegas Resort</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Wynn is betting that his reputation still is golden.</LD>
<LD>   The casino mogul filed plans Monday to take his company, Wynn
Resorts Ltd., public to help finance Le Reve, a new $2.4-billion Las
Vegas mega-resort.</LD>
<LD>   Few property developers have the cachet to sell shares in a
project that has yet to break ground, industry analysts said. It's
really the persona of Wynn, the former chief executive of casino
company Mirage Resorts, that will sell the offering, analysts said.
"People want to bet on Steve Wynn, and more importantly, they don't
want to bet against him," said Joseph Greff, gaming analyst at
Fulcrum Global Partners in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Le Reve ("the dream"), touted to be Las Vegas' new preeminent
luxury hotel, is Wynn's answer to casino giant MGM Mirage's
properties such as Bellagio, the Mirage and Treasure Island, which
redefined the city's strip. Wynn founded Mirage Resorts, but a weak
share price and a heavy debt load helped precipitate his sale of the
firm to MGM Grand for $6.4 billion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Most developers would expect to finance a project such as Le Reve
with loans and private equity, then sell stock later when the company
is able to attract investors with a financial track record, Greff
said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Wynn aims to raise as much as $408 million with an
initial public stock offering and an additional $350 million through
mortgage bonds, and finance the remainder through loans, according to
a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.</TE>
<TE>   The filing did not detail the number of shares to be sold or the
price range. Wynn Resorts is seeking a Nasdaq listing under the
symbol WYNN. It hired Deutsche Banc Securities, Bear Stearns, Banc of
America Securities and Dresdner Kleinwort to manage the stock sale.</TE>
<TE>   Le Reve, to be developed on the site of the old Desert Inn, won't
have a single theme. It will take its motifs from the Southwest. It
will include a 45-story hotel tower, a lake and a man-made mountain.</TE>

<HD>'Fallen Angel' Junk Tally Continues to Rise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The junk bond market may be about to get significantly bigger.</LD>
<LD>   The number of companies with credit ratings downgraded to "junk"
status could be headed for another record year, Standard &amp; Poor's
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "Globally, the annual total number and dollar value of 'fallen
angels' this year will rival those of 2001," the ratings firm said.</LD>
<TE>   Fallen angels, companies that lose investment-grade ratings, have
been on the rise for six years, S&amp;P said. So far this year, issuers
with $47 billion of bonds have been cut to junk, a rating of BB-plus
or lower, S&amp;P said. Last year, a record 57 issuers with $107 billion
of debt were cut to junk.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P said 69 issuers worldwide now are one notch above junk and are
on review for downgrade or have a negative credit outlook.</TE>

<HD>XO, Latest Telecom Casualty, Files for Chapter 11
Protection</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy: Firm still hopes to complete an $800-million
deal, but investors are skeptical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long-struggling XO Communications Inc., a debt-laden telephone and
Internet service provider founded by mobile phone pioneer Craig
McCaw, added its name to the carnage in the telecom industry Monday
by putting itself in bankruptcy, where a judge will help sort out its
future.</LD>
<LD>   The Reston, Va., company, which financiers Carl Icahn and Theodore
J. Forstmann briefly haggled over earlier this year, said it still
will try to complete a pending $800-million deal made in January with
Forstmann's company and Telefonos de Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   But in a letter to XO lawyers nearly two weeks ago, Forstmann
Little &amp; Co. and Telmex said it is "virtually impossible" for XO to
meet the obligations under the purchase agreement because the value
of its assets has eroded substantially and it faces considerable
financial hurdles as well as securities fraud lawsuits and other
litigation.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's too late," said one insider involved in the
restructuring effort. "The [Forstmann] plan will go nowhere and the
company will eventually be liquidated."</TE>
<TE>   XO believes it can meet the conditions and complete the deal
before the offer expires Sept. 15, said spokeswoman Lisa Miles. And
if it can't, the company said it will go with its back-up plan to
raise $250 million, initially from existing shareholders, and remain
a stand-alone operation.</TE>
<TE>   In a market with too much fiber-optic cable and too little demand
for high-speed services, XO will face a daunting task.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous telecoms already have filed for bankruptcy, including
Global Crossing Ltd., the fourth-largest financial collapse in the
nation's history.</TE>
<TE>   And their assets are being written down drastically as the
worldwide glut of network capacity that cost billions to install is
being sold for millions--essentially pennies on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Among telecom failures, XO's assets of $8.7 billion make it the
second-largest failure behind Global Crossing, which listed $22.4
billion in assets in its Jan. 28 petition. XO's Chapter 11
reorganization case lists debts of $8.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The assets consist primarily of a fiber-optic network that
operates in 65 cities in 22 states, including 25 of the largest 30
U.S. metropolitan areas. The debts include $5.1 billion in bonds,
$1.8 billion in preferred stock and $1 billion in bank loans.</TE>
<TE>   XO was expected to file for bankruptcy, but with a prepackaged
reorganization plan that already had the approval of bank lenders,
bondholders and other creditors.</TE>
<TE>   XO has long been working on restructuring and acknowledged the
possibility of filing a Chapter 11 petition to limit such liabilities
as shareholder equity and loan and bond payments, analysts said. The
Forstmann-Telmex deal, negotiated last fall and signed in January,
would bring in $400 million from each investor.</TE>
<TE>   It would pump $600 million into the company and give bondholders
$200 million in cash and 18% of the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Forstmann was an early investor, putting $1.5 billion into the
firm--and writing it all off since.</TE>
<TE>   But bondholders balked at the plan. Icahn, who had bought about
$750 million worth of bonds when they were selling for about 20 cents
on the dollar, offered to put $550 million into the company for a 55%
stake. His offer came with majority approval from bondholders.</TE>
<TE>   Bankers, though, insisted on a number of conditions that proved to
be deal-breakers, such as putting the entire purchase price in a
nonrefundable escrow account and leading the company to a profit in
its first quarter after the restructuring. Icahn pulled out last
month, and Miles said his offer remains off the table.</TE>
<TE>   With XO now in bankruptcy without a prepackaged plan, Icahn still
might be able to pick up some of the pieces down the road, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which has never been profitable, has lost more than
$6.1 billion since it went public in the fall of 1997. That includes
a $2.2-billion loss for the first three months this year on top of a
$2-billion loss last year.</TE>
<TE>   The red ink has flowed almost as much as sales have soared. The
firm reported $1.3 billion in revenue last year, an eightfold
increase over 1998 sales. Revenue for the first three months hit
$333.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts, such as Simon Reeves of Pacific Crest Securities in
Portland, Ore., believe XO has good networks and can compete with the
Baby Bells such as SBC Communications Inc. for business customers in
metropolitan areas.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts note that competition is stiff. Some question whether
XO has customers who will stay with it through the reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   XO doesn't have much time or a lot of money. It went through
$106.4 million of its cash in the first three months as it built out
some of its networks, leaving it with $352.6 million in cash at the
end of March.</TE>
<TE>   A year earlier, it went through $247 million in the first three
months to end up with $740 million in cash.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has been cutting costs for much of the last year and will
be reducing the amount of cash flowing out in capital expenditures
from about $136 million in the first quarter to less than $50 million
in the current period, Miles said.</TE>
<TE>   "We clearly have enough cash to carry us well after the three to
five months it should take us to restructure the company," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street wasn't so sure. The stock, which hit $66 a share two
years ago, lost about a penny to close at 3 cents a share in
over-the-counter trading.</TE>

trustees and Supt. Roy Romer at the district's new headquarters. The
total cost for the 7- by 8-foot restrooms, each with a toilet and a
sink, is about $100,000, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   That is part of more than $180 million being spent to buy,
renovate and move into the 29-story former bank building on Beaudry
Avenue just west of the Harbor Freeway near downtown. The district's
current headquarters on nearby Grand Avenue, where school board
members long have had private bathrooms, is being converted to a high
school campus.</LD>
<TE>   The spending on the new bathrooms is angering the teachers union,
which also is protesting the recent series of spending cutbacks that
will raise many class sizes and reduce services in the nation's
second-largest school district.</TE>
<TE>   "It's outrageous," said Day Higuchi, president of United
Teachers-Los Angeles. The union, which keeps a sharp eye on
bureaucratic extravagance, dug up a building permit showing that the
district is spending $1.6 million for improvements to the new
headquarters' 24th floor, where the private bathrooms are. District
officials said that represents upgrades such as basic wiring and
plumbing being done on each floor.</TE>
<TE>   "What that translates into is kids are paying for it directly,"
Higuchi said.</TE>
<TE>   An informal survey indicated that students concur.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they might spend money on that, I don't think it's
right," said Lilia Torres, student body president of Jefferson High
School, where the ratio of students to bathrooms is estimated by a
community group at more than 500 to 1. Students generally said the
bathrooms are inconvenient, crowded and dirty, though many blamed
vandalism by schoolmates for some of the problems.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike a few years ago, when many of Jefferson's bathrooms were
out of order or locked, they all are in use today, school officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Principal Norm Morrow, who came to the school in August, said he
hopes to increase supervision in the restrooms. "We're only as good
as the number of people we have working daily," Morrow said.</TE>
<TE>   At the new headquarters, the eight executive bathrooms are
spartan, said Anne Valenzuela Smith, the district's executive
administrator for business issues. "No tubs or showers. A toilet and
a sink, a couple of hooks for hanging up stuff. Linoleum floors, four
walls and the plumbing to go with it," she said. "It's very, very
basic."</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela Smith said board members need personal space. "Public
officials are accosted in the hallways. They get stopped by members
of the public, other employees. They get lobbied," she said. "We are
going to provide them a private bathroom so they can have a moment."</TE>
<TE>   Board President Caprice Young said private bathrooms for herself
and the board members are not needed, although they have them now.
But district planners decided to add the perk in the new building
without consulting her, Young said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are sort of de rigueur for elected officials in Los
Angeles," she said. "I'm sure that's why staff made the decision to
put them in. If I was personally polled, I would have said, 'Why
bother?' " She said that it was too late to stop the construction
when she learned of it and that it would cost more to rip out the
plumbing than would be saved.</TE>
<TE>   Young said she did not micromanage planning for the new
headquarters at 333 S. Beaudry Ave. But she did reject a couple of
items that came up during hallway conversations, such as proposed
board chairs at $1,300 apiece. "We can continue to use our same board
chairs," Young said.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the practice of supplying elected officials with private
bathrooms isn't as prevalent as Young supposed. Los Angeles County's
five supervisors each have one. But in the recent renovation of Los
Angeles City Hall, only eight of the 15 City Council offices were
designed with private bathrooms, the city's office of chief
legislative analyst reports. The offices were distributed by
seniority. The other council members use bathrooms in their office
suites, shared by their staffs.</TE>
<TE>   The bathroom issue is the latest in a succession of controversies
involving the district headquarters relocation. Critics allege that
the new building, for which the district paid $75 million, is an
unsuitable white elephant. They are angry that additional funds
topping $100 million are being spent on renovations and other
post-purchase costs, including reinforcement of 19 floors that could
not otherwise support all district files and office equipment.</TE>
<TE>   An internal district audit warned that the costs could continue to
escalate, and some employees who have moved complain of uneven floors
even after the reinforcement. Because Bank of America won't vacate
the building entirely until 2006, the district must continue to lease
some space elsewhere for its staff.</TE>
<TE>   And, since the new building doesn't have enough parking for
employees and the public, a plan under consideration would be to buy
the adjacent large garage and building once home to the Pacific Stock
Exchange's Los Angeles trading floor.</TE>
<TE>   The bathrooms came up for debate among senior staff a few months
ago because the new building had far fewer than the current
headquarters. A decision was made not to replicate the dozens of
private bathrooms used by senior staff at the old headquarters on
Grand Avenue, Valenzuela Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   People losing their private bathrooms are taking it bravely.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Ott, deputy superintendent for instruction, said she never
thought of her bathroom as private. "Many people use the one I have
when they are here for meetings," she said.</TE>
<TE>   District General Counsel Harold J. Kwalwasser said that the new
building will be a great improvement, regardless of his personal
inconvenience. "I can live without the bathroom," he said.</TE>

<HD>Plane Battling Blaze Crashes</HD>
<DH>Wildfires: Three die as air tanker goes down near Yosemite.
Elsewhere, hundreds flee flames in San Bernardino County.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An air tanker crashed Monday while fighting a Northern California
blaze, killing all three crew members, while in San Bernardino County
hundreds fled a fire that roared across Interstate 15.</LD>
<LD>   The air tanker crew was battling a 10,000-acre blaze about 25
miles north of Yosemite National Park when the plane lost both wings
and crashed into a field, erupting into a fireball, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   Ted Glassburn said he had been watching the plane drop retardant
and swoop out of a canyon after its final pass. Its right wing was on
fire, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "He went to jerk it up and the right wing exploded," Glassburn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, the hair on Glassburn's neck was singed as the
plane hit less than 150 yards from his auto repair shop. It narrowly
missed a housing development across the road, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It exploded on impact," Glassburn said.</TE>
<TE>   Reno station KOLO-TV's news crew was interviewing a man watching
the skies with his camcorder when the plane appeared, trailing red
fire retardant. Both wings suddenly snapped off.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw it circle around once and then drop through the middle
there ....That's where we saw it break up," reporter Terri Russell
said. "It was almost surreal. You saw it go down and for a second, I
thought, 'Is that really what I saw?' "</TE>
<TE>   The C-130 tanker had been battling a blaze that began Saturday
about 90 miles south of Reno, near Interstate 395, that had forced
the evacuation of about 1,000 people from the town of Walker and a
Native American community, Camp Antelope. It nearly doubled in size
Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   More than 600 firefighters battled the blaze, but all aircraft
were grounded after the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the cause of the fire was "human" but could not
specify. Because it is in a remote area near one used by the U.S.
Marines for survival training, containment efforts were slowed by
unexploded ordnance.</TE>
<TE>   Footage of the tanker crash stunned Karen Terrill, the chief
spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection, who said both wings appeared to have ripped off as the
plane descended.</TE>
<TE>   "That can't be. That's not supposed to happen," Terrill said as
she watched tape of the crash on television.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation experts expressed caution about drawing any quick
conclusions about the cause of the crash, pointing out that because
of the loads they carry, wings usually are the strongest part of a
plane.</TE>
<TE>   But Lew Aaronson, a retired Continental Airlines pilot, said that
over a brush fire, the sharply maneuvering planes are subject to
powerful forces.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see how the heat of the fire could create updrafts,
downdrafts, side drafts that could tear the wings off," Aaronson
said.</TE>
<TE>   In San Bernardino County, three firefighters suffered first- and
second-degree burns fighting the Blue Cut fire, which began about 2
p.m. Sunday near Interstate 15 just south of the junction with
California 138.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday evening it had grown to 5,500 acres and, whipped by
strong winds, had jumped across both the north and southbound lanes
of Interstate 15 near the Cajon Pass.</TE>
<TE>   More than 850 firefighters were battling the blaze, which was only
10% contained by Monday night. But no other injuries were reported
and no homes were destroyed, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they didn't know when they would have the fire
under control. The cause is still under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "The vegetation is so explosive, that this is what makes it
dangerous to our firefighters," said Bill Peters, spokesman for the
California Department of Forestry in San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   "These conditions just are so unusual that it makes it a little
unpredictable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Interstate 15, which had been reopened after a closure Sunday that
delayed thousands trying to return to Los Angeles from Las Vegas, was
shut down again Monday just as the evening commute began.</TE>
<TE>   As the fire spread north and east, residents living on large lots
in the unincorporated area of Oak Hills just south of Hesperia were
evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   County sheriff's officials helped residents load horses and other
livestock for transportation to evacuation centers.</TE>
<TE>   Hotels and motels in Hesperia and Victorville were booked solid
with refugees from the fire and the freeway. Vohn and Jodie Sherman,
returning from Las Vegas, said it took them two hours to inch two
miles.</TE>
<TE>   When they finally could exit the freeway, "Nobody told us what to
do from there. They didn't tell us what was going on, where to go,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The evacuation order was lifted at about 10 p.m., and the
southbound lanes were reopened. The northbound lanes were expected to
open soon.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the region, a 6,949-acre fire that began Saturday on
coastal Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County was 10%
contained.</TE>
<TE>   In Kern County, a 3,430-acre fire near Lake Isabella was 60%
contained, and authorities hoped to fully surround it by tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The fire destroyed five homes, five vehicles, seven outbuildings
and two boats Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In Arcadia, one home was severely damaged and two others partially
burned Monday when a downed electrical wire touched off a blaze on
West Norman Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Three firefighters suffered minor injuries, officials said.</TE>

<DH>Antelope Valley: Medical staff fear plan to turn hospital
into outpatient clinic would put care out of reach for many.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High Desert Hospital sits in a remote location next to a state
prison. It has only 75 beds and no emergency room.</LD>
<LD>   But local officials say the small public hospital in Lancaster
plays a crucial role in the Antelope Valley, offering free or nearly
free health care for the 25% of area residents who lack insurance.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, doctors and nurses were alarmed by the Los Angeles
County Health Department's recommendation to shut down the hospital's
in-patient services, or any care that would require a hospital stay
of 24 hours or more.</LD>
<TE>   "That means we will only be able to operate on lumps and bumps,"
said Indra Vyas, the hospital's chief of surgery. "The people who
come here have no insurance, and usually no money .... Where will I
send them?"</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley authorities say the area cannot afford to lose
another hospital. During the 1990s, the valley population grew by
27%, to 318,000, but two of its five hospitals closed. That has left
the valley with a ratio of 1.5 acute-care beds per 1,000 residents,
compared with 2.5 beds per 1,000 in the rest of Los Angeles County,
according to the High Desert Hospital advisory council, a group of
government and health care officials fighting to save the facility.</TE>
<TE>   "Already, some patients are very sick and need to go to the
hospital, and a lot of times there's just no beds for them," advisory
council board member Norm Hickling said. "If High Desert closes down,
more people are going to have to drive 60 miles to get medical
attention."</TE>
<TE>   County health officials say they can save $13.5 million a year if
they scale back the hospital's services and operate it as an
ambulatory care clinic, offering outpatient services only.</TE>
<TE>   During fiscal year 2000-01, the hospital provided inpatient
services to 1,000 people. County Health Director Thomas Garthwaite
said officials believe they can serve far more people with a clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Vyas said the inpatient services are crucial for the many poor and
working-class patients. While they could go to Antelope Valley or
Lancaster Community hospitals, both private facilities in Lancaster,
many are afraid to sign the forms that make them liable for any bills
incurred there, and wind up skipping treatment altogether, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Others will have to drive to the closest county facility in Sylmar
when they are seriously ill.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many indigent patients who don't have a car and who
can't even afford a taxicab," nurse Claudia Karner said. "Some are
going to die before they even reach the emergency room."</TE>
<TE>   Miranda Hernandez, 27, who is uninsured, underwent major abdominal
surgery at High Desert last week. She hasn't been able to keep a job
because of her medical problems, and the bills forced her to move in
with her parents a few months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital is only a few miles away from her parents' home in
Lancaster, but she does not know how she would get to the Sylmar
hospital in the event of another emergency.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents have been helping me out, but they work," said
Hernandez, who was still recovering at the hospital Monday. "I can't
depend on them all the time." Some help may be on the way. A private
company, Universal Health Services, is planning to open a 120-bed
hospital by 2005, Lancaster spokeswoman Barbara La Fata said.</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. Russell Gross, a surgeon at High Desert, said a new
private hospital won't mean much for poor patients.</TE>
<TE>   "When people with no insurance show up at places that expect to
get paid, they really get kicked around," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "[Our patients] are either going to go into town and flood the ERs
there, or flood the system down in Los Angeles."</TE>

<HD>Family Awarded $1.3 Million in Hogtying Death</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: Jury finds that L.A. County deputies were
negligent in the arrest of a man, 41, who died in custody.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER and JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury awarded $1.3 million in damages Monday to the parents of a man
who died in custody after ruling that four Los Angeles County
sheriff's deputies were negligent when they hogtied him.</LD>
<LD>   Those deputies had earlier received commendations from the
department for their actions, which were videotaped by a sergeant who
was supervising the arrest. One juror said the videotape was the key
evidence in the trial.</LD>
<LD>   Dwayne Nelson, 41, died on Sept. 13, 1998, after he was arrested
on suspicion of being under the influence of cocaine and firing a gun
in the Athens area. Jurors in Los Angeles County Superior Court
awarded $2 million to the parents, but cut that amount to reflect
Nelson's partial responsibility for his own death, which they fixed
at 35%.</LD>
<TE>   Deputies testified that Nelson was acting erratically and was
kicking the windows of a patrol car. He died on the pavement in the
parking lot of a fast food shop near Imperial Highway and Normandie
Avenue, shortly after deputies tied his hands and feet behind his
back.</TE>
<TE>   His parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the county and
the law enforcement agency, claiming that the deputies did not
correctly hogtie him. The suit contended that Nelson was cooperative
with police and that there was no need to restrain him, said Leo
Terrell, the attorney for Nelson's mother, Lottie Nelson of Memphis.
Terrell said that none of the officers were threatened, and that they
failed to put Nelson on his side, effectively preventing him from
breathing.</TE>
<TE>   The four deputies involved--Curt Messerschmidt, David Florence,
David Porter and Jeff Siroonian--were not disciplined for the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   "These deputies did everything to save [Nelson's] life," said
Principal Deputy County Counsel Dennis Gonzales after the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Capt. Ray Leyva said the restraint procedure is meant to
be used only when deputies fear for their safety, or the well-being
of the person in custody. "We still think it's an effective tool. We
have a pretty good policy."</TE>
<TE>   The jury deliberated for five days in the courtroom of Judge David
L. Minning.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of tension," said juror Pablo Cortes of El
Sereno. "We all felt the officers were negligent but disagreed about
the cause [of death]."</TE>
<TE>   Cortes said the videotape was overwhelming evidence. "We watched
it over and over again," he said. "This was an emotional case."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson's father, Wallace Nelson of Chicago, said he remains
puzzled by his son's death.</TE>
<TE>   "Once he was in custody, you'd think he was safe. I can never
understand how it could happen like that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   David Dotson, a police expert, testified that the deputies didn't
perform the hogtie correctly, failing to turn Nelson on his side, and
took their time doing CPR.</TE>
<TE>   Three medical experts testified that Nelson's death was caused by
an existing heart condition, combined with his cocaine use, Gonzales
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said that the county has yet to determine if there will
be an appeal and that the department still employs hogtying, which is
known as TARP (Total Appendage Restraint Procedure).</TE>
<TE>   Hogtying is still used by law enforcement, although some agencies,
including the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the Los
Angeles Police Department, have restricted the procedure in recent
years.</TE>
<TE>   They have done so in response to a spate of deaths across the
country in the early 1990s that raised questions about risks
associated with the practice.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD, for example, still allows officers to restrain suspects'
hands and feet, but requires ties to be loose enough to allow the
suspect to walk and sit, said Cmdr. George Gascon.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the Sheriff's Department in the 1990s drew up new rules
requiring that suspects restrained in this manner be videotaped and
monitored by paramedics. The rules were designed to ensure suspects'
safety, said Lt. Ralph Webb, and the Sheriff's Department maintains
that the risks associated with the practice have now been minimized.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time those risks are disputed by police.</TE>
<TE>   Some sheriff's officials cite conflicting medical evidence
about the risk of death from asphyxia, suggesting that other factors,
such as drug overdose, may be involved.</TE>
<TE>   Despite controversy, though, lawsuits against the Sheriff's
Department involving hogtying are relatively rare, Webb said.
Wrongful death suits stemming from shooting incidents far outnumber
them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Nelson's divorced parents said the videotape was their
strongest piece of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "The video prevented the county from spinning a story," said
Terrell. "Without the tape, we would have lost."</TE>
<TE>   The county never offered to settle the case, Terrell said. "This
is a case that should not have gone to trial," he said. "We sent them
numerous letters to settled, and they offered us zero."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace Nelson said he appreciated the jury's verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "Money really doesn't save anything," he said. "I'd rather have my
child."</TE>

<HD>Mauling Murder Count Voided</HD>
<DH>Law: Judge throws out the verdict against a defendant,
saying she did not know the dogs would kill a neighbor. He lets stand
lesser convictions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA and SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A judge on Monday threw out a second-degree murder conviction against
a San Francisco woman in the gruesome dog-mauling of a neighbor in
January 2001, citing insufficient evidence that the owner knew the
dogs would kill.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge James Warren upheld convictions against
Marjorie Knoller and husband Robert Noel on the lesser crimes of
involuntary manslaughter and keeping a dangerous animal.</LD>
<LD>   Warren sentenced Noel to the maximum of four years in state prison
in the death of 33-year-old lacrosse coach Diane Whipple. But he
postponed the sentencing of 46-year-old Knoller until mid-July so
prosecutors could have time to persuade him to reconsider.</LD>
<TE>   If those efforts fail, Knoller will face a maximum of four years
in prison. She could have been sentenced to 15 years to life had the
murder conviction stood.</TE>
<TE>   The judge's ruling outraged the prosecutor and the victim's
partner, who said he effectively invalidated the jury system.</TE>
<TE>   While calling Knoller and Noel "the most despised couple" in San
Francisco for raising two dangerous dogs they knew to be "time
bombs," Warren said the evidence did not support second-degree murder
because prosecutors did not show that Knoller knew the dogs would
kill Whipple when they encountered her in the hallway of an upscale
apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   The judge acknowledged that the case has outraged the Bay Area and
much of the state--some letters he has received, he said, encouraged
him to impose the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   But Warren said his hands were tied: "I understand the enormous
frustration of the people. There is no question in the court's mind
that in the eyes of the people the defendants are guilty of murder.
In the eyes of the law, they are not."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Whipple's partner, Sharon Smith, fought back tears as she
questioned why the judge would contradict a Los Angeles jury that had
convicted the couple on all counts after a five-week trial. Citing
pretrial publicity, Warren had moved the trial south to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in shock; we're all in shock right now," Smith said. "Justice
was done, and now I feel that justice has been undone."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. James Hammer pointed out that prosecutors did
not initially seek a murder charge but that a grand jury that
reviewed the evidence had added the charge.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what the grand jury chose. They were right, and you have
taken that away," Hammer said, pointing a finger at the judge. "And I
think it is a travesty."</TE>
<TE>   Don Newton, who served as foreman of the trial jury, found the
judge's decision curious:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed," Newton said. "We didn't believe anything
Marjorie Knoller said. And we followed pretty closely the
instructions that [Warren] gave us in terms of malice and
second-degree murder. But they have a right to appeal, and that's the
way the system works. If they win on appeal, it doesn't destroy the
rest of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Knoller was the first California dog owner convicted of murder in
a mauling case. Prosecutors are now investigating whether they can
take Knoller to trial again on the murder charge, and whether they
can bring additional charges against Noel, who the judge suggested
was more culpable and may also be guilty of perjury for lying to a
grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   Smith initially told her civil attorneys she could not endure a
second trial, but her lawyers later said she would support any
decision made by prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Warren said the state did not prove Knoller demonstrated "implied
malice," a point he called central to the case. To uphold a
second-degree murder charge, the law says that Knoller had to have a
"subjective understanding" that her actions would bring serious
bodily harm or death when she brought the dogs outside her apartment
that day, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The defendants were on notice they had wild, uncontrollable and
dangerous dogs that were going to do something bad," he said. "Is
that something bad death? I cannot say as a matter of law that she
[Knoller] subjectively knew that a human being was going to die."</TE>
<TE>   One of Knoller's attorneys, Donald Horgan, said the judge made the
right decision. "It was certainly a difficult and courageous
decision. It was also the right decision," he said. "Ms. Knoller
simply did not expect that what happened would happen."</TE>
<TE>   In a proceeding carried live on local television, Warren said he
also found it troubling that prosecutors did not seek a second-degree
murder charge against the 60-year-old Noel, who took the lead in
raising the two powerful Presa Canarios but who was not present at
the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "To say he wasn't responsible because he wasn't there," the judge
said of Noel, "is like arguing that he [planted] a bomb and then took
a plane to New York City and therefore is not responsible for the
damage the bomb does."</TE>
<TE>   After receiving credit for time already served and for good
behavior, Noel will probably serve an estimated 13 months in prison,
prosecutors say.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Dist. Atty. Terence Hallinan said his office has
contacted the state attorney general's office to prepare an appeal of
Warren's ruling. That is the only way prosecutors can reinstate the
second-degree murder conviction unless Warren reconsiders, said
University of Santa Clara law professor Gerald Uelmen.</TE>
<TE>   Nedra Ruiz, a lawyer who initially represented Knoller, said in an
interview that the judge made the correct decision--but only after
botching the trial by allowing the jury to hear prejudicial evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason the jury looked at Marjorie with such blame is that
the judge let in a lot of irrelevant evidence," said Ruiz, whose
courtroom antics, such as getting on all fours to act out the attack,
added to the trial's circus atmosphere. "I absolutely feel that this
is the beginning for a fair hearing in a court of law for Marjorie."</TE>
<TE>   Whipple died Jan. 26, 2001, after being attacked outside her
Pacific Heights apartment by the two dogs. Often breaking into tears,
Knoller testified at the trial she tried to save Whipple by yanking
at the leash of one dog, Bane, and had sprawled on top of Whipple.</TE>
<TE>   But on Monday, Warren dismissed Knoller's statements.</TE>
<TE>   "Ms. Knoller, I don't believe you. I don't believe a lot of what
you said," he said. "Nobody is ever going to know really what
happened here, why two dogs attacked a defenseless woman trying to
get her groceries into her apartment."</TE>
<TE>   At first, Warren seemed ready to issue a severe punishment against
the couple, who are both attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   He said testimony in the case repeatedly showed that Knoller and
Noel knew their dogs were dangerous, mentioning a letter from a
veterinarian and several "encounters" with neighbors who were menaced
by the animals--including a 6-year-old boy and a woman who was eight
months pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   Warren also recited statements the couple made after the attack,
citing an appearance on the national television show "Good Morning
America," in which they blamed Whipple for her own death by saying
she somehow "acted macho" and threatened the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said he was also incensed by a letter Noel sent after
Bane had been put to sleep, saying, "Bane is dead and, by the way, so
is the neighbor."</TE>
<TE>   "I believe you are the most despised couple in this city," Warren
said to Noel and Knoller, who were dressed in orange jail jumpsuits.
"I don't believe anybody likes you."</TE>
<TE>   But then the judge did an about-face: As a woman gasped, Warren
said that public emotion and sympathy did not play a role in the
application of the law and threw out the murder conviction.</TE>
<TE>   The court also heard from several of Whipple's friends and family
members, who said Knoller and Noel should be made to pay by receiving
the maximum sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Smith spoke the most pointed words when she looked at Noel and
Knoller and said, "I want to address the people who murdered,
murdered my life partner and best friend."</TE>
<TE>   As Noel wrote furiously in a notebook, Smith chastised the couple
for never apologizing to the family or showing remorse for their
involvement in Whipple's death. "You were too busy being lawyers to
be human," she said. "This has been a game to you. One big legal
game. But this has not been a game to me or Diane or our families."</TE>

<HD>They'd Like to Put This Ad on Death Row</HD>
<DH>Billboard: City councilman says sign for new rap album is
'over the top.' Neighbors are circulating a petition condemning it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like a broken record, those in the Wilshire district kept repeating
the same refrain Monday about a controversial record company
billboard: "Take it down!"</LD>
<LD>   They were angry about the sign atop the Death Row Records building
at the intersection of Wilshire and San Vicente boulevards that
depicts a man sitting on a toilet with his pants down.</LD>
<LD>   Beneath the toilet and a drawing of a partially unfurled roll of
toilet tissue is a catch phrase containing an obscenity.</LD>
<TE>   The V-shaped, lighted billboard advertises a new rap music album.
It towers over a glass-walled office building between the Beverly
Hills city limits and Los Angeles' popular Museum Row.</TE>
<TE>   "It's inappropriate for this area. Even if it was downtown, I
don't think it would be appropriate," said Steve Hawkins, a business
consultant who works in an office building nearby on Wilshire
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials agree. They say complaints about the
billboard have poured into City Hall since the ad for an album called
"Say Hi to the Bad Guy" was erected a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Jack Weiss, who represents the area, said he
intends today to call for an investigation into whether the billboard
meets both structural and decency laws.</TE>
<TE>   Court cases in the past have suggested that obscenity laws are
tied to community standards, but Weiss said the billboard "is so over
the top" that it has to be investigated.</TE>
<TE>   "This is at a gateway to an exclusively residential area. I'm a
1st Amendment absolutist, but I think we have to ask the question
whether this actually meets the legal test for obscenity," he said
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly hard to imagine a community" whose standards would
include "using the bathroom with a scatological message," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss said he will ask the City Council to seek a ruling from the
city attorney's office on the language and from the Building and
Safety Department on the billboard's "physical legality."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Beverly-Wilshire Homeowners Assn., meantime, were
gathering signatures on a petition condemning the billboard as
passersby on bustling Wilshire Boulevard shook their heads over it.</TE>
<TE>   In the building beneath the billboard, Death Row Records
officials, known for songs such as "Serial Killa," refused to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a record company. We're promoting," said an employee before
ordering a security guard to shut the door in a reporter's face. "I
didn't give him permission to write anything down," she told the
guard.</TE>

<HD>Case Is Built Against Blake Co-Defendant</HD>
<DH>Courts: The actor's bodyguard researched silencers online,
prosecutors say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the months before Robert Blake's wife was fatally shot, the
actor's co-defendant searched for information about firearm silencers
on the Internet and thumbed through a catalog of weapons books that
included a professional's guide to preparing ambushes, according to
prosecution documents filed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles detectives found the evidence while searching Earle
Caldwell's Burbank apartment April 18, the day he and Blake were
arrested as suspects in the May 4, 2001, killing of Bonny Lee Bakley
near a Studio City restaurant, according to the documents.</LD>
<LD>   Blake is charged with murder, two counts of soliciting Bakley's
murder and conspiring with Caldwell, his bodyguard and handyman.
Blake and Caldwell, who was also charged with conspiracy, both
pleaded not guilty to the charges in April.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles County prosecutors cited the evidence taken from
Caldwell's apartment to support their decision to charge Blake, the
star of the 1970s television series "Baretta," with murder by means
of lying in wait, a capital offense.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Blake's attorney, Harland W. Braun, asked the court to
throw out the lying-in-wait allegation as unconstitutionally vague
and set a $1-million bail. Blake has been held without bail at Men's
Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles since his arrest. He faces life
in prison without parole if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Attys. Patrick R. Dixon and Gregory A. Dohi said in
court papers that evidence shows that Blake, 68, plotted for months
to kill Bakley, 44, before he shot her to death. Authorities say
Blake despised Bakley, whom he married six months earlier after a
paternity test proved he fathered her child.</TE>
<TE>   "If this case does not qualify as intentional murder by means of
lying in wait, it is hard to imagine a case that does," the
prosecutors wrote. "Defendant Blake's age does not entitle him to a
discount either in the amount of the bail or the charges filed
against him."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash is expected
to rule on Blake's bail motion today in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   In the court documents, LAPD Det. Ronald Y. Ito noted that a
dogeared page in the catalog found in Caldwell's apartment advertised
a book titled, "Killing Zone: A Professional's Guide to Preparing or
Preventing Ambush" by a former Navy SEAL commander.</TE>
<TE>   The book, which "details the principles and techniques of ambush
and counter ambush for soldiers and civilians alike," is "for
academic study only," according to the catalog description.</TE>
<TE>   In the same search, police seized two computers from Caldwell's
apartment. A police analysis shows that in January 2001 someone used
the computers to search the Internet for books and videos on how to
make gun silencers, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   One of those Web sites offered how-to titles ranging from the
"Workbench Silencers: The Art of Improvised Design" to "Whispering
Death," prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Caldwell, 46, had planned to kill Bakley during a
camping trip a week before her death but "lost his nerve."</TE>
<TE>   The court documents filed Monday also provide additional details
about the slaying. Bakley was shot in the right jaw and shoulder with
a vintage 9-millimeter pistol as she sat in the passenger seat of
Blake's car, according to a police statement, and had no defensive
wounds.</TE>
<TE>   The car was parked next to a construction site and behind a large
trash bin, more than a block from Vitello's restaurant, where the
couple had dined.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors believe that Blake left Vitello's by 9:30 p.m. and
that a 911 call from a neighbor was placed at 9:40 p.m., giving Blake
"at least 10 minutes to commit the murder."</TE>
<TE>   Blake told police he went back to Vitello's to retrieve a
.38-caliber handgun he left at his table and returned to find Bakley
bleeding. Police found the murder weapon, an untraceable Walther
P-38, in the trash bin the day after the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   There were no fingerprints on the gun, according to authorities,
and the gunshot residue found on Blake's hands could have come from
another firearm.</TE>

<DH>Rehabilitation: Eleven years after being shot in the head,
student completes a Santa Monica community college program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Both mother and son try not to dwell on what they could have done
differently that November night 11 years ago when a .45-caliber
bullet pierced his brain.</LD>
<LD>   She might have disregarded that 104-vehicle freeway pileup near
Coalinga the day before, which made her tell him to use surface
streets coming home from the movies.</LD>
<LD>   He might not have flooded his car's engine as he tried to flee
from bullets spraying through his rear window. And when the car
stalled and the men following pulled him out, he might have thought
of just the right words to satisfy them.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the pair focus on what Jaime has achieved--and will yet
achieve--after nine years of classes through Santa Monica College's
program for students with acquired brain injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Today, they have reason to celebrate: Against all medical
predictions, Jaime will graduate from community college.</TE>
<TE>   He was left for dead that November night, just a mile from his
Inglewood home, after being shot point blank in his right cheek in a
robbery. Then 18 and an aspiring policeman attending Harbor College,
he spent the next six months in a coma and awoke unable to walk or
talk.</TE>
<TE>   The men involved in the shooting have never been caught. Out of
fear that they will find him and retaliate, Jaime asked to be
identified only by his middle name for this article.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime, 29, still has a gentle baby face and thickly muscled legs
left over from being a star baseball player at Carson High School. A
deep hollow in his cheek and a scar hidden in his dark hair are the
only signs of what he refers to as "the crime."</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to not think about something like this, but I would be
a very sad person all the time if I let myself focus on something so
horrible," said Jaime, who lives with his mother. "Accepting that I
was no longer able to do stuff for myself and that I had to depend on
other people have been the hardest things."</TE>
<TE>   A sense of humor and his mother's support brought Jaime through
the roughest times, starting when he came home from the hospital and
did nothing for hours but sit on a couch, staring straight ahead with
his hands on his knees.</TE>
<TE>   "I ... knew I had to push him to do something," said his mother,
Gabby. "I was not going to let a young guy stay home and allow being
disabled to excuse him from living the rest of his life."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, where
Jaime was a patient during most of his coma, recommended he relearn
life skills through the Santa Monica College program.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started the program, graduating from college was the last
thing on my mind," Jaime said. "I just wanted to be at high school
level."</TE>
<TE>   Created in the early 1980s, the program has about 60 students with
brain injuries from motor vehicle accidents, tumors, strokes and
falls, as well as gunshot victims like Jaime.</TE>
<TE>   For most students, the first year includes learning strategies to
compensate for their disabilities, as well as computer skills and
physical education classes.</TE>
<TE>   After two semesters, most students can start taking mainstream
classes, although program coordinators work with professors so that
allowances can be made--such as giving them more time on tests.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime started the program in the summer of 1993 and had a hard
first year, said Director Sandi Burnett.</TE>
<TE>   "He had to approach education in a very, very different way than
... before," Burnett said. "It's always a hard pill to swallow for
individuals to have to backtrack so significantly. They have to work
hard to pick up things they may have had very much under their belt
before."</TE>
<TE>   For the first two years, Jaime's mother drove him to and from
Santa Monica, sometimes staying long enough to be sure he found his
way to the next class. Now he takes buses and the light rail, both to
college and to a Santa Monica elementary school where he tutors.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has regained most of the skills he had before the
shooting, Jaime said it takes him about five times as much work to
learn as it did before. Because he can remember how easily things
used to come to him, it is difficult sometimes for him to remember
his deficits. Before each semester, his mother had to force him to
drop some of the classes he'd signed up for while thinking he could
work at his prior level.</TE>
<TE>   Denial of one's limitations is common for people in Jaime's
situation, said neuropsychologist Roger Light, who worked with him
for several years through an outpatient rehabilitation program and a
support group. But staying motivated was never a problem for Jaime,
Light said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though he had devastating deficits, he was always
cooperative," he said. "On one level he was resigned that his life
would never be the same. But at the next level, he wasn't giving up."</TE>
<TE>   The support he received at Santa Monica College has been
instrumental in his success, Jaime said.</TE>
<TE>   After a couple of years teaching preschool, he hopes to transfer
to a university so he can teach older children.</TE>
<TE>   "When doors have closed in my face, I don't just walk away," Jaime
said. "I knock them down, I kick them in, but I don't give up."</TE>

<DH>Neighborhoods: City acts in long-running battle over the
expansion of a house used for worship by Orthodox Jews.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles officials have halted construction work on a Hancock Park
home used for services by a group of Orthodox Jews, renewing a
contest between the rights of religion and the city's power to
control the character of its neighborhoods that has already been
heard by courts and Congress.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been seven years, it'll be 70 years of fighting, but we're
going to prevail," vowed Rabbi Chaim Rubin of Congregation Etz Chaim.
"We're going to continue building it, and we're going to continue
serving the Orthodox Jewish community."</LD>
<LD>   Only a couple of walls and a partial staircase are still standing
after a demolition crew--doing preliminary work to renovate and
enlarge the home--was ordered to desist a week ago.</LD>
<TE>   The work sparked anger among neighbors who have long resented the
fact that the congregation holds services in this affluent
neighborhood zoned for single-family homes.</TE>
<TE>   Residents say they've purposely been kept out of the loop about
the plan, which calls for a house more than twice the size of the
original 3,700-square-foot dwelling. They say the congregation is
trying to circumvent a lawsuit settlement it reached with the city to
maintain the property as a residence, in exchange for permission to
conduct limited religious activities there.</TE>
<TE>   "They're putting up a synagogue in the heart of a residential
neighborhood, and it doesn't belong there," said Marc Sweet, a member
of the Hancock Park Homeowners' Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin, who owns the property, said the new structure will look
like any other home in the neighborhood. He also said he is not
obligated to share his plans with residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, it's none of their business," Rubin said. "People
can build homes. I could have built a 1,000-square-foot bungalow and
they would have objected because it was too small.... No matter what
I do, they will criticize."</TE>
<TE>   Zoning conflicts involving houses of worship have arisen across
Southern California in recent years. Last October, Los Angeles County
supervisors approved a temporary ban on new churches in Rowland
Heights at the urging of residents worried about their property
values.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin testified before Congress about the ongoing zoning problems,
and Congregation Etz Chaim's dilemma was cited by federal lawmakers
when they passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons
Act of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The law prohibits local land-use and zoning regulations from
substantially burdening religious practice, unless officials can show
a compelling government reason for their actions. Rubin contends that
the city is doing just that to his congregation, particularly with
its recent cease-and-desist order.</TE>
<TE>   For a quarter of a century, Rubin's father ran a small
congregation out of his home in Hancock Park. When he grew too old to
host the services in the mid-1990s, his son moved them three blocks
away to an unoccupied house at the busy intersection of Highland
Avenue and 3rd Street.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors complained about the congregation's comings and goings,
as the group gradually grew to about 60 members.</TE>
<TE>   To resolve the dispute, the rabbi sought a conditional-use permit
for the house. He argued before the Los Angeles City Council that the
congregation needed a synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors say they expected the property to be renovated, and were
shocked when it was nearly razed to the ground. "It's a pile of
rubble now," said Rudy Gintel, who sits on the board of the
homeowners association.</TE>
<TE>   The stop-work order issued June 10 states that the demolition
exceeded the scope of the building permit for an addition of 4,423
square feet to the house, plus a loft and two-car garage.</TE>
<TE>   The rabbi defended the demolition, saying that parts of the house
were in poor condition and collapsed on their own during the
dismantling of the roof and stripping of inner walls. Rubin said he
again feels his congregation is being singled out and that city
officials are siding with the homeowners' association to stall
improvements to the property.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just outrageous that the city ... after they get some
vicious e-mails attacking the project, that they should send down
building and safety inspectors to shut down the project," he said.
"They can't tolerate us at all to exist here."</TE>
<TE>   The association only wants the congregation to abide by the terms
it agreed to in the settlement, said president Jim Wolf.</TE>
<TE>   The city has ordered the congregation to submit revised plans
before work may resume. In the meantime, services are temporarily
being held at Rubin's home a few blocks away on June Street.</TE>
<TE>   "The work has stopped," Rubin said. "We're not going to violate
that ... but we're going to get this [order] removed as soon as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   It's unlikely that the synagogue's opponents will back down
either. "A great many in the community would rather see it as a
vacant lot than to see a religious facility there," Gintel said.</TE>

<HD>Police Vow to Thwart Fireworks</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Except for public displays, the city of Los Angeles has long banned
fireworks, but enforcement of the law has sometimes been spotty. This
will not be the case this year in the harbor area, officials said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   With the councilwoman from the area, the mayor's sister Janice
Hahn, pledging $2,000 from her office fund for the fireworks show at
Cabrillo Beach, police and fire commanders vowed a maximum effort
against private use.</LD>
<LD>   Harbor Police Capt. Andrew Smith said at a news conference that he
will deploy all available personnel in the Los Angeles Police
Department Harbor Division to crack down on those violating the law.</LD>
<TE>   Violators are subject to a $1,000 fine or six months in jail,
although Smith said the policy is to give first-time youthful
offenders a warning. As for commercial-quality fireworks, the bomb
squad may be summoned to detonate them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fireworks are sold in nearby Lomita, and officials expressed
resentment Monday that booths are open right next to the Los Angeles
city line.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the last year for which complete figures were available,
there were 69 injuries from using fireworks in Los Angeles and 188
statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said that fireworks use has been mounting this year well in
advance of the Fourth of July, with quite a few being used to mark
the recent Lakers victories. "And they have not been little bottle
rockets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A Fire Department representative, Alfred Hernandez, said that with
this year's record dryness in Los Angeles, the danger that fireworks
can set off devastating brush fires is very high.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-eight cities in Los Angeles County permit the sale of
fireworks, but none can be used legally in Los Angeles city limits.</TE>

<HD>D.A.'s Office Charges 26 in Welfare Fraud Totaling $1
Million</HD>
<DH>Courts: Some defendants collected assistance while owning
property and buying luxury cars, prosecutors say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than two dozen people were charged with welfare fraud Monday for
allegedly collecting public assistance totaling at least $1 million
while owning homes and businesses and in some cases spending lavishly
on luxury cars and vacations.</LD>
<LD>   In all, 26 people were charged in 14 cases, according to Los
Angeles County prosecutors. The suspects include residents of Beverly
Hills, El Monte, Glendale, Long Beach, Rosemead and Van Nuys.</LD>
<LD>   The amounts that authorities say were fraudulently collected
ranged from $22,000 to $254,000. Many of the defendants face
additional charges, including perjury, conspiracy, video piracy and,
in one case, possession of a controlled substance, said district
attorney spokeswoman Jane Robison.</LD>
<TE>   In brief court appearances Monday, all but three of the defendants
entered pleas of not guilty. The remaining suspects posted bond and
will be arraigned later, Robison said.</TE>
<TE>   Those charged include 11 Glendale residents identified as Alvard
Bouniatian, 36; George Bouniatian, 45; Varoujan Derkskian, 61; Hovik
Gharadaghi, 26; Khachik Gharadaghi, 51; Gloria Gutierrez, 38; Moses
Hartounian, 51; Robik Hartounian, 29; Nvard Keshoyan, 53; Hossein
Mehrabiani, 41; and Remik Telmi, 51.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also charged six residents of Beverly Hills. They were
identified as Juliet Beroukhim, 43; Rahmatollah Efrahimi, 54; Yafa
Shiriyan, 47; Yahya Elyaszadeh, 60; Fariba Yousefzadeh, 39; and
Soleman Efrahimi, 49.</TE>
<TE>   Other defendants included Sophon Chea, 52, Eang Meng, 49, and
Sokha Mao, 29, all of Long Beach; Nastya Stambultsyan, 37, and Ogsen
Stambultsyan, 43, both of Van Nuys; Linh Hue Tran, 39, and Phuong

<HD>Abuse of Young Inmate Alleged</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Teenager says he was molested by a priest who
served as a counselor at Juvenile Hall. Cleric's attorney denies the
accusation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An El Sereno priest who is under investigation by Los Angeles police
for sex abuse allegedly began molesting a teenager at Central
Juvenile Hall, where the priest counseled incarcerated youngsters,
according to the attorney for the teenager's family.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged victim, 15, told a therapist in April that he had been
molested by Father Stephen Hernandez several times since meeting the
priest in 1998, said Marc D. Wasserman, the boy's attorney. The
therapist notified police.</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez, 68, attempted suicide by cutting his wrist and taking
an overdose of pills after learning that the Los Angeles Police
Department's sexually exploited child unit was investigating the
allegations, police said. Hernandez is one of 34 priests under
investigation by the unit.</LD>
<TE>   Lt. Daniel Mulrenin said detectives investigated the allegations
against Hernandez and forwarded the case to prosecutors for a
decision on whether to file charges. "He did have access to youths in
Juvenile Hall," Mulrenin said.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Steier, the priest's attorney, said Hernandez did nothing
wrong. Hernandez, who retired in 1997, could not be reached for
comment. He was living at Our Lady of Guadalupe church in El Sereno.</TE>
<TE>   Tod Tamberg, the Los Angeles archdiocese spokesman, said Hernandez
was retired and his official assignment history does not indicate
that he worked either as a chaplain or volunteer chaplain at Juvenile
Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot divulge any information because of the confidentiality
of the minor," said Ken Kondo, a spokesman for the county Probation
Department, which runs Juvenile Hall. He confirmed that the
department knows about the police investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman said Hernandez met the Eagle Rock youth at the county
facility on Eastlake Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "My understanding, he was conducting church services inside
central juvenile and he started seeing [the boy] on a weekly basis,"
Wasserman said.</TE>
<TE>   The boy developed a close bond with the priest and eventually
Hernandez became his godfather, Wasserman said. Some of the
molestations allegedly occurred in the sleeping area of the hall,
Wasserman said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney also alleged that after the youth's release,
Hernandez touched him at the boy's home and at the priest's home at
Our Lady of Guadalupe church.</TE>
<TE>   The priest, he said, also took photographs of the teenager in
various states of undress. A search warrant was served on the
priest's residence after the boy was interviewed by Los Angeles
police.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman said the teenager is back in the juvenile system because
of criminal allegations. Wasserman declined to say why he is being
held.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police said they are seeking any other possible
victims. "We need people to come forward," Mulrenin said. An
individual who comes forward may be able to corroborate another
victim's account, he said. "That second account can be vital to a
prosecution."</TE>

exploited child unit at (213) 485-2883.</TE>

<HD>Antidote Pills Will Go to Reactors' Neighbors</HD>
<DH>Safety: Terror risk at San Onofre, Diablo Canyon calls for
potassium iodide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state plans to distribute potassium iodide tablets to nearly half
a million people living within 10 miles of nuclear generating
stations in San Onofre and Diablo Canyon, saying the pills could help
protect the public in the event of radiation exposure.</LD>
<LD>   The decision comes six months after the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission offered the pills to the 34 states with nuclear power
reactors. Officials said the idea was developed over several years
but took on urgency after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which
highlighted the vulnerability of the nation's 103 nuclear power
stations.</LD>
<LD>   Pills will be given to 421,000 residents in the portions of San
Diego and Orange counties that surround San Onofre and 22,000
residents in San Luis Obispo County, where Diablo Canyon is.</LD>
<TE>   Millions who live near nuclear reactors in Connecticut, New
Jersey, New York and eight other states received the pills this year,
and officials in Ohio and Pennsylvania have requested them.</TE>
<TE>   Though potassium iodide doesn't shield against all types of
radiation poisoning, it can protect the thyroid from absorbing
radioactive iodine if taken in the first four hours of exposure.
Thyroid cancer can result from radiation exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear plants are considered possible terrorist targets because
radioactive contamination could spread over wide areas. Federal
officials said Monday that they know of no specific threats against
any nuclear plants, which have been ordered to complete security
upgrades by the end of August.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Southern California Edison, which owns San Onofre's
two working 1,120-megawatt reactors, insist that the plant is
adequately protected.</TE>
<TE>   The latest study to examine what might happen if a major radiation
leak occurred was completed in 1982 and painted a grim picture.</TE>
<TE>   If the dome on one of the two working reactors were breached, the
study said, it could result in 27,000 deaths within a year of the
accident, 18,000 additional long-term deaths from cancer and $186
billion in property damage. The study didn't specifically theorize a
terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Not So Simple</TE>
<TE>   Government officials warned that distribution of potassium iodide
tablets on such a large scale and involving such a sensitive public
health issue can be fraught with confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Breck Henderson said some
residents might erroneously believe that taking the pills would
protect against all types of radiation when they protect the thyroid
against only one type of radioactive isotope.</TE>
<TE>   "The best protection is evacuation or [finding] shelter," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other questions: How often to distribute the pills--they have a
shelf life of only a few years--and how to deal with people moving
from the area and taking the pills with them, leaving new occupants
without? Nuclear plants such as San Onofre also have periodic drills
using their emergency sirens, so residents would have to better
warned so they don't take the pills unnecessarily, Henderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of those things where the devil is in the details,"
added Dr. Mark Horton, Orange County's health officer. "It isn't so
much that it's not a good idea. It is a good idea, but how do you get
them to the right people? How do you do it in an efficient,
cost-effective way? I'm sure we'll come up with a reasonable plan."</TE>
<TE>   In San Clemente, the city closest to San Onofre, a group called
the Coalition for Responsible Ethical and Environmental Decisions has
been crusading for the storage of potassium iodide pills as part of a
broader platform for increased security since Sept. 11. But in Dana
Point, there has been little clamor for the tablets, and officials
there question whether the state's plans make sense.</TE>
<TE>   Sheryl Lindsey, Dana Point's interim administrative services
director, said the pills might be better administered by physicians
because they are prescription-strength and could pose health risks to
some users. (The NRC said a small percentage of people are allergic
to the pills.)</TE>
<TE>   "When you're talking about administering prescription medication
to a populace at large, I think that's a more complex discussion than
just 'Let's hand it out to everybody,' " Lindsey said. "It needs to
be handled carefully, and we only hope the state will do that."</TE>
<TE>   Boundary Disputed</TE>
<TE>   In San Luis Obispo, many residents say it's unfair to only offer
pills to those living in a 10-mile radius of the Diablo Canyon plant.
The boundaries include all 18,000 residents Los Osos but leaves out
the 10,000 residents of Morro Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't draw a line and say people on one side of the street
get it and people on the other side of the street do not," said
Shirley Bianchi, the county supervisor who represents the communities
north of the plant.</TE>
<TE>   San Luis Obispo County proposes that the pills be given to 143,000
permanent residents, as well as 85,000 coastal visitors on peak
summer weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state's plan, people living outside the 10-mile radius
could order tablets at pharmacies or through the Internet. Each pill
would cost $1 to $2.</TE>
<TE>   Prodding the state into distributing the pills became a recent
crusade for Orange County talk-show host Dana Roth of KPLS-AM (830).
Three weeks ago, Roth began calling state officials on the air and
asking why the pills hadn't been given out.</TE>
<TE>   "It took them seven months," Roth said Monday. "That's typical
political bunk. California should be a leader; we shouldn't be
playing catch-up."</TE>
<TE>   The state's plan took several months to complete because officials
had hoped to first create a consistent policy with local officials on
how and when to distribute the pills and where they would be stored,
said Eric Lamoureux, spokesman for the state Office of Emergency
Services.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't able to do that," he said, "so we thought it was
prudent to make the request anyway. We didn't want to miss the
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Lyn Harris, a San Clemente resident who has been pushing for the
tablet distribution, said the state's plan doesn't go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   She said more pills will be needed for the surfers and campers who
regularly flock to a state park that stretches right in front of the
plant.</TE>

<HD>Driving While Distracted Can End in Trouble</HD>
<DH>Eating, playing with gadgets or doing things normally done
in the bathroom or bedroom can cause accidents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his seven years as a California Highway Patrol officer, Joseph
Pace has seen drivers do some pretty dumb things behind the wheel.
But perhaps the stupidest act was performed by a motorist driving 75
mph last summer on the Glenn Anderson Freeway in South Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that the driver was going 10 mph over the speed limit.
It's that he was doing it while watching a soccer match on a portable
television set he held in one hand. The driver used his other hand to
adjust the antenna--it is difficult, after all, to get good reception
in a moving car. He used his knees to steer.</LD>
<LD>   Pace cited him for driving at an unsafe speed for prevailing
conditions. "The safe speed for driving with no hands is zero miles
per hour," Pace said.</LD>
<TE>   While shocking, this type of behavior is nearly an everyday
occurrence on the freeways and streets of Southern California,
according to CHP officers, truck drivers and other professional
motorists.</TE>
<TE>   Such extracurricular activities behind the wheel range from the
mundane (talking on a cell phone), to the bizarre (driving naked) to
the death-defying (putting on pantyhose). Many motorists have been
caught in the driver's seat performing tasks that are normally done
in a bathroom, such as brushing teeth or putting on makeup. And a few
have been cited for performing deeds typically conducted in the
bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that
at least 25% of police-reported crashes involve some form of driver
inattention. That number may be higher in Los Angeles, where
commuters spend an average of an hour a day in traffic. That's the
equivalent of nearly 11 days a year.</TE>
<TE>   A recent survey of motorists in 10 of the nation's largest cities
dubbed Los Angeles drivers "masters at multi-tasking behind the
wheel." The survey, by a coalition of steel manufacturers, found that
68% of Los Angeles drivers routinely drink beverages and 59% eat
while driving. An additional 15% of drivers apply makeup, shave or
comb their hair while navigating L.A.'s treacherous roads, according
to the survey.</TE>
<TE>   "You name it and our officers have encountered it," said CHP Sgt.
Tim Maley, a 25-year veteran.</TE>
<TE>   There is no violation in the California Vehicle Code for driving
while applying makeup. Instead, law enforcement officers typically
cite distracted drivers under Section 22350: unsafe speed for
prevailing conditions. It is the equivalent of a speeding ticket.</TE>
<TE>   According to Southern California police agencies, CHP officers and
truckers, such dangerous driver deeds fall into the following four
categories:</TE>
<TE>   Dressing, Grooming</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to make use of the long hours spent on the road, many
commuters perform their morning grooming rituals--shaving with
electric razors, brushing teeth and applying makeup--while driving to
work. But some take it a step too far.</TE>
<TE>   CHP Officer Ken Duke said he recently cited a woman for putting on
makeup--using the rearview mirror ... while reading a newspaper ...
draped on the steering wheel--and driving on the Pasadena Freeway.
"She wasn't very happy about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   About a year ago, veteran truck driver Margaret Peterson said she
was cruising along the Long Beach Freeway about 55 mph when, from her
elevated vantage point, she spotted a woman steering a car with her
knees while using both hands to try to work her legs into a pair of
pantyhose.</TE>
<TE>   "I have trouble putting on pantyhose in my own home, so I don't
know how she pulled it off," said a flabbergasted Peterson. "It was
unreal."</TE>
<TE>   Electronic Gadgets</TE>
<TE>   Cell phone use has become common on L.A. streets, but reserve Los
Angeles Police Officer Eric Rose said he stopped a speeding motorist
who was practically conducting a business meeting from within his
Mercedes-Benz on Ventura Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley a few
weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, who was holding an e-mail device in one hand, was
reading the message on the screen while using the other hand to talk
on a cell phone. The steering he left to his knees.</TE>
<TE>   But that driver might be considered downright cautious compared
with the man CHP Officer Brandon Shipwash ran across about a year ago
on a downtown Los Angeles street.</TE>
<TE>   While driving about 30 mph, the motorist was spotted playing a
computerized football game on a Sony PlayStation that was built into
the car's console.</TE>
<TE>   "He was really getting into the game, too," Shipwash said.</TE>
<TE>   Nudity, Intimacy</TE>
<TE>   CHP Sgt. Maley recalls the many years he patrolled the desert
freeways near Indio as dull and uneventful--for the most part. He
remembers one hot summer night when he was responding to a call of a
stranded motorist.</TE>
<TE>   He stopped a car on a deserted road to ask the occupants if they
had seen the ill-fated motorist. When Maley peered into the car, he
was surprised to see a young couple wearing nothing but expressions
of surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Maley let them go with just a warning, saying: "This is
California, so...."</TE>
<TE>   Since the invention of the back seat, cars have been a favorite
setting for acts of intimacy. But CHP officers say they almost
routinely run across motorists in the throes of passion while
cruising along at highway speeds.</TE>
<TE>   CHP Officer Jesse Cazares recalls several years ago pulling up
behind a car weaving along on the eastbound Ventura Freeway. From his
vantage point, Cazares could see only the driver behind the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as I put the light on the car, a second person's head popped
up," Cazares said.</TE>
<TE>   Not only was the driver distracted by his amorous female
passenger, but he was drunk as well. Cazares said the driver went to
jail and the woman walked home.</TE>
<TE>   Eating, Drinking</TE>
<TE>   Almost everybody eats or drinks while driving, but police say some
motorists take snacking on the road to dangerous levels.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Sheffield, a retired law enforcement officer and amateur
photographer, created a Web page (home.san.rr.com/fsheff/incars. htm)
that includes pictures of motorists performing various perilous acts
while driving. Perhaps the most astonishing image is of a man driving
70 mph while eating a meal.</TE>
<TE>   CHP Officer April Hoguin said she recently cited a driver who left
her dumbfounded.</TE>
<TE>   The motorist was on the Golden State Freeway, traveling about 60
mph, holding a steaming bowl of soup in one hand and the spoon in the
other. He used his knees to steer.</TE>
<TE>   The danger of such behavior is that an unseen pothole or an
unexpected lane change by a nearby motorist can put a quick and messy
end to the meal and the commute.</TE>
<TE>   About four months ago, CHP Officer Jaret Paulson came upon a
two-car collision on the Harbor Freeway near downtown Los Angeles. No
one was seriously injured.</TE>
<TE>   It was clear from the evidence at the scene, he said, that the
woman who caused the accident was trying to drive while eating
chicken and rice from a Tupperware bowl and drinking juice from a
container she held between her legs.</TE>
<TE>   "You could tell what happened because there was rice and chicken
and juice all over the windshield inside that car," Paulson said.</TE>

<LD>When a driver was pulled over for making an illegal U-turn in
Paramount, she was asked if she knew why she was stopped. Her
less-than-convincing answer, according to the city's newsletter:
"Because I didn't see the 'No U-turn' sign.' "</LD>
<LD>   In parallel lanes: He admits it may be "mocha ado about nothing,"
but columnist David Allen, the conscience of Ontario, revealed that
that city's logo bears a strong resemblance to the Folgers coffee
logo (see shocking evidence).</LD>
<LD>   Both show a golden sunburst and 10 points of light rising above a
red mountain range. On their Web sites, each logo's sun also moves,
rising from behind the mountains.</LD>
<TE>   Mmm-mmm bad? Well, no one's nerves seemed jangled at the Ontario
Convention and Visitors Bureau when I phoned. Director David Aldana
said he hadn't heard any complaints from residents.</TE>
<TE>   "But," he added, "I'm just the interim director."</TE>
<TE>   By the way, you'll notice that the city's Web site labels it
"Southern California's Ontario" so that it won't be confused with the
rival brand in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   That Crazy Ol' Sun (cont.): Doug Anderson of Rancho Santa
Margarita saw an ad for a Dana Point mansion that apparently has a
view of both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Swan songs: My plea for a theme tune for secessionist Valleyites
brought a heartwarming reaction from readers.</TE>
<TE>   The nominees included:</TE>

<TE>   * "L.A. Breakdown," Jack Jones (from Gary Myers).</TE>
<TE>   * "Let's Just Kiss and Say Goodbye," the Manhattans (from David
Allen).</TE>
<TE>   * "It's Too Late Baby," Carol King (from Steve Driggs).</TE>
<TE>   * "I Get Along Without You Very Well," Robert Goulet (from Kenneth
Fleischer).</TE>
<TE>   Anthems for the anti-secessionists: Some folks sent along songs
for the other side, including:</TE>
<TE>   "Stay," Jackson Browne (from Wickerd), and, of course, "We Can
Work It Out," the Beatles.</TE>
<TE>   And there's the gospel song "There'll Be Peace in the Valley"
(from Allen).</TE>
<TE>   Plates in motion: Scott McCarty of Upland writes that his wife, an
ophthalmologist, has a vanity plate that says AR UCNOK (Are you
seein' OK?). He swears they once pulled alongside a car with the
plates CN DBBLE (Seein' Double).</TE>
<TE>   And, I assume, gave Seein' Double plenty of room to pass.</TE>
<TE>   Sex and splinters: Dale Franz of Woodland Hills read an Internet

<HD>Cookout Burn Victim Critical</HD>
<DH>Safety: Lake Forest man suffers injuries over 70% of his
body after alcohol ignites from barbecue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 27-year-old Lake Forest man badly burned in a Father's Day barbecue
accident remained in critical condition late Monday, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   The man, whose name has not been released, suffered second- and
third-degree burns to about 70% of his body. He was being treated at
the burn unit of UCI Medical Center in Orange.</LD>
<LD>   Capt. Stephen Miller of the Orange County Fire Authority said the
men squirted denatured alcohol over charcoal to accelerate the fire.
The flame traveled up the stream of liquid and blew up the container,
resulting in a flash fire, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The incident happened Sunday afternoon outside the man's
ground-floor apartment on Rimhurst Drive with young children and the
man's wife present. No one else was injured. The apartment was
slightly damaged.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, this type of accident is not uncommon," Miller
said. "It's very tragic."</TE>
<TE>   Miller pointed out the dangerof using inappropriate materials on a
charcoal fire. "Once you've lighted charcoal briquettes, you don't
use any type of accelerants to get the fire going faster," he said.
"If you're using materials like gasoline or alcohol, the vapors
themselves are flammable. They don't even have to touch anything to
light."</TE>
<TE>   As people begin to use their grills more frequently, Miller said,
it is important "to be patient and let the charcoal get to the
temperature it needs to over time. You want to be careful to keep
children away from the grill. Kids are fast, and if they fall into
the grill, charcoal can come in contact with their clothes quickly."</TE>

bullets while covering rioting that followed the Lakers' victory in
the NBA finals last year.</LD>

rights lawsuit that they were filming the disturbances outside

them, knocking them to the ground and injuring them.</LD>

<HD>Former Broker Gets Prison for Swindling Woman Out of Home</HD>
<DH>Crime: Associate gets probation for fraud in
reverse-mortgage scam on $1-million house.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Woodland Hills mortgage broker was sentenced to a year in
federal prison Monday for swindling a Malibu woman out of title to
her $1-million home.</LD>
<LD>   Edward Rostami, 39, also was ordered to pay $482,000 in
restitution to Eleanor Coppola and China Trust Bank.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon Palmer-Ross, 41, a former associate, was sentenced to three
years' probation, including four months of home detention.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Rostami and Palmer-Ross persuaded Coppola to deed
over her property in order to participate in a "vested income
program" that would pay her a monthly income but return the property
to her, free and clear, any time she wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Rostami and Palmer-Ross altered the deed, describing the property
as a "bona fide gift" when they pledged it as security for a loan,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   When Coppola sought to reclaim title to the property, they
refused. She eventually recovered it through civil litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Rostami pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiracy, while
Palmer-Ross entered a guilty plea to mail fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The two recently completed state prison sentences for swindling an
elderly Santa Clara homeowner out of $742,000 in another
reverse-mortgage scam.</TE>
<TE>   Rostami and Palmer-Ross brokered loans through several business
entities, including TriStar Mortgage, Polo Financial Services and
KISS International. In civil suits and complaints to state
regulators, they were accused of cheating numerous loan clients and
lenders through bait-and-switch tactics and outright forgeries.</TE>
<TE>   After being charged in the Santa Clara case, they fled to Mexico.
Palmer-Ross was later arrested while trying to reenter the country
with three Mexican nationals in the trunk of her car. Rostami was
apprehended in Rosarito Beach, Mexico.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal court judge has tentatively ruled that an Oxnard man
wrongly convicted of murder cannot sue Santa Barbara prosecutors for
false arrest or malicious prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   But the judge let stand allegations that prosecutors violated
Efren Cruz's civil rights before and after his 1997 murder
conviction.</LD>
<LD>   Six months ago, Cruz, 27, filed a civil rights lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles seeking about $120 million in damages
from police and prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   Cruz spent four years in state prison before a judge ruled that
credible evidence suggests another man pulled the trigger during a
gang-related shooting in downtown Santa Barbara in January 1997.</TE>
<TE>   After his release, Cruz sued Santa Barbara County Dist. Atty.
Thomas W. Sneddon and three senior prosecutors for conspiracy and
malicious prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges that prosecutors and Santa Barbara Police
Department officers conducted a negligent investigation and withheld
evidence favorable to Cruz, including witness statements that
indicated another man was the shooter.</TE>
<TE>   In February, lawyers representing Santa Barbara County filed a
motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that prosecutors were
immune from liability and could not be sued for their actions during
the case.</TE>
<TE>   In her tentative ruling Friday, U.S. District Court Judge
Florence-Marie Cooper agreed that the district attorney and his
deputies could not be sued for malicious prosecution or false arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper narrowed the scope of Cruz's lawsuit by dismissing several
additional claims against the county.</TE>
<TE>   But a summary of her ruling shows she also found Cruz could sue
prosecutors for conspiracy.</TE>

<LD>A federal court judge has tentatively ruled that an Oxnard man
wrongly convicted of murder cannot sue Santa Barbara prosecutors for
false arrest or malicious prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   But the judge let stand allegations that prosecutors violated
Efren Cruz's civil rights before and after his 1997 murder
conviction.</LD>
<LD>   Six months ago, Cruz, 27, filed a civil rights lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles seeking about $120 million in damages
from police and prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   Cruz spent four years in state prison before a judge ruled that
credible evidence suggests another man pulled the trigger during a
gang-related shooting in downtown Santa Barbara in January 1997.</TE>
<TE>   After his release, Cruz sued Santa Barbara County Dist. Atty.
Thomas W. Sneddon and three senior prosecutors for conspiracy and

<TE>   The suit alleges prosecutors and Santa Barbara Police Department

<TE>   In her tentative ruling Friday, U.S. District Court Judge
Florence-Marie Cooper agreed that the district attorney and his
deputies could not be sued for malicious prosecution or false arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper narrowed the scope of Cruz's lawsuit by dismissing several
additional claims against the county.</TE>
<TE>   But a summary of her ruling shows she also found Cruz could sue
prosecutors for conspiracy and Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Hilary Dozer
specifically for defamation because of his remarks to the media about
the case.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz's suit stemmed from his arrest after a shooting at a
city-owned parking garage on Jan. 26, 1997. Two groups of young men,
some of them Oxnard gang members, exchanged taunts and one man pulled
a gun.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Torres, 23, of Santa Barbara died of a gunshot wound to
the head. Santa Ynez resident James Miranda, 21 at the time, was
injured but recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz, the only one who didn't flee the scene, was arrested, and
police found a chrome .38-caliber revolver nearby. Forensic tests
revealed that Cruz had gunpowder residue on his hands, and a motorist
leaving the parking structure identified him as the shooter.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz was convicted of second-degree murder, but he was released
after police and prosecutors in Ventura County in 2000 obtained a
tape-recorded confession from an Oxnard gang member who admitted
firing the deadly rounds.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles police officer who was killed in an off-duty traffic
accident in Agua Dulce was identified Monday as Larry Piesco, a
21-year LAPD veteran.</LD>
<LD>   Piesco, 49, of Canyon Country, was 18 days from retirement when he
died Sunday, LAPD Capt. Bill Williams said.</LD>
<LD>   Colleagues described Piesco as a fun-loving man who enjoyed golf,
computers and taking his motorcycle on long rides. He was assigned to
the West Traffic Division. Piesco's death "hit the whole division
hard," Williams said.</LD>
<TE>   California Highway Patrol investigators said Piesco's Honda
motorcycle slammed into the driver's side of a van that was making a
U-turn from the right shoulder of Soledad Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the van, identified by the Los Angeles County
coroner's office as Dean Wilder, 81, of Sylmar, was pronounced dead
at the scene. His wife remained hospitalized with moderate injuries,
investigators said.</TE>

<HD>Parks Announces Council Bid</HD>
<DH>Politics: The former LAPD chief begins his campaign for the
8th District seat. Magic Johnson pledges his support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks on Monday formally
announced that he is running for the 8th Council District seat,
kicking off his campaign in the lobby of the Magic Johnson Theatres
at the Crenshaw Shopping Plaza.</LD>
<LD>   Joined by Johnson, Parks said he is ready for a career in
politics.</LD>
<LD>   "People have asked me, particularly the media, 'How are you going
to adjust to the 14 council people?' And I've always answered that
question with: 'How are they going to adjust to Bernard Parks?' " he
said.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson said he will support the Parks campaign. The
Laker-turned-businessman also said he is not planning to run for
mayor--despite reports to the contrary. But he said he would support
Parks for the job if he decides to run against Hahn in two years.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a strong, tall man who holds his head up high," Johnson said
of Parks. "We need a leader like that now, who doesn't compromise. He
can't be bought off."</TE>
<TE>   Parks announced his retirement from the LAPD in April, after 37
years of service, after the Police Commission's denial of his request
for a second five-year contract. A majority of the City Council
supported the commission's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The 58-year-old former chief filed papers with the city's Ethics
Commission on May 29, allowing him to set up a campaign committee and
start raising funds for the City Council election next March.</TE>
<TE>   So far, eight others have filed papers to run in the 8th District,
which covers parts of south and southwest Los Angeles. They are
Assemblyman Rod Wright (D-Los Angeles), Robert Cole, Sherri L.
Franklin, Kevin D. Melton, Karen Bass, Earnest T. Hamilton Jr.,
Sandra Noble and Sylvialynn Hawkins.</TE>

<HD>Computerized Legal Assistance Is Getting Its Day in Court</HD>
<DH>Law: Information kiosks are helping people who can't afford
an attorney represent themselves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When single father Thurman Williams needed help filling out papers in
a custody suit recently, he didn't look to his lawyer for help. He
walked to a computerized kiosk at the Orange County Family Court and
started tapping the keys.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a legal experiment, lawyer-less litigants across
California are using computerized video kiosks to prepare common
court filings and seek basic legal advice.</LD>
<LD>   The kiosk used by Williams is part of a statewide effort to cope
with a flood of litigants who cannot afford or refuse to hire their
own lawyers. Court officials statewide fear the number of
self-represented litigants has reached crisis levels and threatens to
clog court calendars.</LD>
<TE>   Like Williams, more than 6,000 Orange County litigants have
initiated court actions on I-CAN! kiosks or accessed the programs on
the Internet, using home computers. Similar programs are operating in
Sacramento, San Diego and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study of the kiosks' first 18 months of operation
concluded it is too soon to tell whether the system will relieve
pressure on court calendars. But the report, by UC Irvine's School of
Social Ecology, said users were overwhelmingly positive about the
free legal assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's made life a lot easier for me," Williams said. "It's helped
keep me from going to the poorhouse."</TE>
<TE>   The 29-year-old Orange resident was directed to a kiosk in the
Betty Lou Lamoreaux Justice Center by court staff. After putting on
headphones and following the directions of a videotaped instructor,
Williams filled out a quarter-inch stack of paternity and custody
documents. The exercise took 20 minutes; it would have cost him about
$800 if he had relied on a lawyer, he said. "It was a lot easier than
I thought."</TE>
<TE>   Whether they simply can't afford a lawyer or just want to save
money, more Californians are choosing to go to court without a
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just amazed at the numbers," said Commissioner Salvador
Sarmiento, who hears between 40 and 90 child-support cases a day in
Orange County Family Court. "Eighty percent of the cases I hear
involve people representing themselves. These cases can take 50%
longer to process than others."</TE>
<TE>   Sarmiento said the kiosks have put many cases on the fast track.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people who appear before me without attorneys are real
nervous," Sarmiento said. "They don't know what to expect and they
want to tell me everything. It's an opportunity for them to vent. A
lot of what they say is irrelevant. When they go to the kiosks
though, I get the information that I need so I can rule."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 4.3 million state residents who find themselves in court
each year, more than half are pro per, or self-represented litigants.
The phenomenon is particularly evident in family courts, where fewer
than 16% of all child-support cases involve parents who are both
represented by lawyers. Also, 80% of all domestic-violence cases are
handled without lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   The State Bar of California has characterized the trend as "the
pro per crisis in family law," and the State Judicial Council has
established a task force on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature has attempted to address the problem by
establishing family-law facilitator offices throughout the state to
help litigants in child-support matters. In courts such as Orange
County's, the offices have offered workshops for litigants. Classes
often have two-month waiting lists.</TE>
<TE>   In Van Nuys, officials last year established the Self-Help Legal
Access Center, in which people can seek legal help from computers and
volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   I-CAN! kiosks are in eight locations, including the Orange County
district attorney's office, Irvine City Hall and the Fullerton and
San Juan Capistrano libraries. However, the busiest location is in
the Family Law Information Center at Family Court in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   At the information center, where open boxes of tissues are
displayed as prominently as forms for initiating divorce, custody and
child-support proceedings, office assistant Beatrice Contreras said
there is often a line of people waiting to use the two machines.</TE>
<TE>   Employing interactive video and touch-screen technology, the
kiosks walk users through the bureaucracy of obtaining
domestic-violence restraining orders, establishing child custody,
responding to child support and eviction orders, initiating
small-claims suits and requesting waivers for legal filing fees. The
kiosks give instructions in English, Spanish and Vietnamese and offer
users video tours of court complexes and primers on what to expect
during hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "People like it because they say it's fast and easy and especially
because they don't have to pay for an attorney. They really like
that," Contreras said.</TE>

<HD>$25,000 Reward Is Offered in Slayings of 2 Cousins</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A $25,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of those responsible for the fatal shooting of
two cousins in Panorama City in April, Los Angeles authorities
announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Philip Gearhart, 24, and John Shellabarger, 26, were found shot to
death April 6 near their homes in the 8700 block of Wakefield Avenue,
Los Angeles Police Det. Mike Oppelt said.</LD>
<LD>   The night before, the two men had been involved in a fight with
patrons at California Broiler Restaurant &amp; Sports Bar in the 8800
block of Tampa Avenue in Northridge, Oppelt said at a news conference
attended by the victims' relatives and City Councilwoman Wendy
Greuel.</LD>
<TE>   The two men left the restaurant about 1:30 a.m. and were shot a
short time later across the street from Gearhart's residence, Oppelt
said. Family members said they heard shots about 2 a.m. but didn't
call police because they had no idea where the shots were fired.</TE>
<TE>   The cousins, who both lived with their parents, were found by
patrol officers about 6 a.m., Oppelt said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is urged to call homicide detectives at
(818) 756-8291 during business hours and (818) 756-8285 on evenings
and weekends.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Talks Iraq but Thinks Iran</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are talking about Iraq,
but they're contemplating Iran. It may eventually be written in the
annals of contemporary history that the ultimate clever deception by
the United States was concentrating the warnings on Baghdad while the
intended target was Tehran.</LD>
<LD>   The chroniclers will describe Osama bin Laden and the few thousand
fanatics he gathered in Al Qaeda as horrible terrorists who managed
to attract the attention of the world for a short time.</LD>
<LD>   They will describe Saddam Hussein as a megalomaniac and glory
hunter who wanted to be remembered as the hero of the Arab world who
stared down Washington.</LD>
<TE>   But the historical records will emphasize the massive, well-
organized, state-subsidized terror that stemmed from and flourished
in Iran. That country, history will record, was overtaken by a
religion that incorporated itself into a so-called legitimate state
for one strategic purpose: the Islamization of the world as the
endgame.</TE>
<TE>   Iran is the personification of Islam, equipped with a navy and an
army, which is developing what would be, in effect, the Islamic bomb.
This nuclear missile will be ready within two to three years at most.</TE>
<TE>   Iran will have no moral dilemma about using weapons of mass
destruction against infidels once it has such devices. It certainly
will be comfortable using such a tool for blackmail. Indirectly, of
course.</TE>
<TE>   Iran is much stronger than Iraq, and its religious fanaticism
cements its mission to eliminate nonbelievers wherever they are. You
can read nowadays open analysis by military pundits in the Iranian
press debating whether two Hiroshima-size bombs would be more than
enough to destroy Israel, or whether one would be sufficient, thus
allowing the second one to be saved for bigger and better things, say
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Iran--a terror organization with a country, a flag and embassies
all over the world--can use its diplomatic pouches to deliver
whatever it sees fit: intelligence information for terrorist attacks
or even small containers of the appropriate germs produced in
laboratories 38 miles southeast of Tehran.</TE>
<TE>   It is inconceivable that we'll attack Iraq, succeed, destroy its
unconventional laboratories and arsenal, come home for a ticker-tape
parade on Wilshire Boulevard and go to the beaches--while Iran is
still there. Imagine a brain surgeon penetrating the skull of a
patient who has two malignant tumors and yet extracting only one of
them. Logic says that, as long as you are in that skull, the same
incision should serve for the removal of the second tumor.</TE>
<TE>   The application here would be that once 250,000 U.S. and British
troops mass to strike in that festering part of the world, they would
hit in two quick blows at Iraq and Iran. I believe that's the reason
for the delay in striking Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The White House and the Pentagon have the responsibility of
planning the big picture. Remember the two bulls, a father and son,
walking pleasantly down the meadow and seeing ahead of them a group
of attractive cows? The excited young bull requests permission from
the father bull to run and make love to one of them. Walk, and make
love to all of them, answers dad with a grin, reflecting common
sense.</TE>

<HD>Easy Target: an Unvaccinated Population</HD>
<DH>Let people decide whether to have smallpox shots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES V. PENA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush wants a new Cabinet-level Department of Homeland
Security. He has also signed legislation devoting $4.6 billion to
battle bioterrorism. But the one simple and most important thing that
the federal government can do in the name of homeland security and
preventing bioterrorism remains undone: make the smallpox vaccine
stockpile available to the American public.</LD>
<LD>   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials are meeting
behind closed doors this week to determine policy about the smallpox
vaccine. Most expect the CDC to stick with some form of the current
"ring containment" strategy, whereby government provides smallpox
vaccinations after a known outbreak in the hope of containing the
spread of the virus. That may make sense for a natural outbreak in a
rural area, but such a policy could be disastrous against smallpox
bioterrorism. As a course of action, it is unacceptable in a society
that values individual life and liberty.</LD>
<LD>   An unvaccinated population is not only vulnerable but an
attractive target. A smallpox attack could occur at multiple
locations and may not be immediately known--initial symptoms are
flu-like, and diagnosis can take 12 or more days. The vaccine must be
given within four days of exposure to be effective. As a result, the
virus could spread widely and kill thousands before the first
vaccinations were given.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, given a dense and highly mobile population, the virus
would probably spread much faster and wider, including to other
countries, than a ring containment strategy could keep up with. And
in the inevitable post-attack panic and confusion, the medical
infrastructure could buckle under the weight of millions of people
demanding immediate vaccination.</TE>
<TE>   A better approach would be to take preventive measures now. The
U.S. government has 15 million doses of smallpox vaccine that,
according to a study published by the New England Journal of
Medicine, can be effectively diluted at least fivefold and perhaps
more. Combined with about 85 million additional doses of newly
discovered smallpox vaccine, plus approximately 200 million doses
already ordered by the government, there is more than enough to allow
for voluntary vaccination.</TE>
<TE>   Naysayers often claim that the threat of a smallpox bioterrorist
attack is remote and that there aren't significant indicators that
such a threat is imminent. Not to put too fine a point on it, but
before Sept. 11, the same could have been said of jetliners being
hijacked and used as missiles to destroy buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The naysayers also cite the risks associated with smallpox
vaccine, claiming that hundreds of people would die and thousands
more would suffer side effects if the entire population was
vaccinated. This would certainly be the case if there was forced mass
vaccination. Because there are known risks, in particular for those
with weakened immune systems, individuals should be allowed to make
voluntary, informed decisions--in consultation with their doctors--to
manage and mitigate those risks. Various polls show that half or more
of the public would like to be vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that Americans are smart enough to decide for
themselves about the smallpox vaccine. The government's withholding
of the vaccine until after an attack assumes otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Even if only a fraction of the population was vaccinated
beforehand, there would be a "community immunity" effect that would
lower the rate of transmission of the disease, so the chances of a
successful attack would be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   This could also have a deterrent effect and thus might prevent
such an attack.</TE>
<TE>   That is common-sense homeland security. The federal government is
shirking its primary responsibility to protect the citizenry by
withholding the vaccine.</TE>

<HD>Even 'Masters of the Universe' Can't Master the Market</HD>
<DH>No matter what gurus do, history argues for greater stock
declines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So Arthur Andersen has been convicted, L. Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco
has been indicted, Samuel Waksal of ImClone has been arrested and
even his friend Martha Stewart has been embroiled in an
insider-trading investigation. And now the Justice Department is
examining Enron for criminality; it shouldn't be too hard to find
something even more rotten in Houston. So what should one conclude
about the stock- optioning, creative-accounting culture of today's
corporations?</LD>
<LD>   Is everyone a crook?</LD>
<LD>   No doubt more legal violations will be found, but the average
investor is more likely to be affected by the breaking of another
rule: the reality of market history, the financial equivalent of the
law of gravity. Put simply, investors have been getting away with
murderous winnings in recent years, and such gains could never have
continued. Indeed, the next few years could well see portfolios
getting murdered instead.</LD>
<TE>   On Aug. 12, 1982, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at
776.9. Over the next 19 years, the Dow went up by a factor of 14,
closing at a peak of 11,175.8 on June 5, 2001. But already, gravity's
pull was being felt.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2001, investment strategist Mark Rostenko predicted that
the then-temporary downward correction in the bull market was in fact
the beginning of a bear market. He based his analysis on the
price-to-earnings ratio of stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. The
historical P/E ratio since 1926, he noted, was 16; that is, share
prices were 16 times the per-share earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen months ago, when Rostenko was prophesying, the S&amp;P P/E was
21, which is to say it was abnormally high. He noted that the two
great bull markets of recent decades, 1949-1966 and 1982-2000, both
began when the P/E ratio was between 7 and 8. So at a 21 P/E ratio,
the market was bumping up against its historical peaks, not down
against its historical troughs.</TE>
<TE>   And so, Rostenko concluded, prospects for continued upward
movement were dim.</TE>
<TE>   What's happened since?</TE>
<TE>   Stock prices have fallen, but earnings have fallen too, and so the
P/E ratio remains at 21. By this reckoning, despite a positive blip
on Monday, the market still has nowhere to go but down.</TE>
<TE>   It's always possible, of course, that conditions will change for
the better; productivity gains from information technology might, for
example, pump up the profits and the market. Yet market jitters over
war and terrorism seem to be canceling out that boon.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if stocks were to drift down to merely their historical
average P/E ratio, the market would fall by another fourth.</TE>
<TE>   So another pile of shoes still to drop are the Guccis worn by Wall
Street "Masters of the Universe."</TE>
<TE>   On the long bulling upward, idols of investment were worshiped,
such as Peter Lynch of the Fidelity Magellan Fund or Abby Joseph
Cohen of Goldman Sachs. But now comes the disillusioning reckoning.</TE>
<TE>   Assets managed by Janus Capital, for example, jumped from $30
billion in 1995 to $330 billion in March 2000. Today, Janus' assets
have shrunk to $159 billion.</TE>
<TE>   And there's probably more such shrinkage ahead. Stagnant markets
show a basic fallacy of investing, which is that most fund managers
can't beat the overall performance of the market. Smart as money
mavens might be, few can outsmart the globalized market. John Bogle,
who beat the averages during his 50 years on Wall Street, calculates
that over those five decades mutual funds lagged 1.8% per year behind
the S&amp;P index.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the answer? According to Bogle, it's indexing.</TE>
<TE>   That is, buy stocks or funds that mirror the market, and then sit
tight as the market goes up and down.</TE>
<TE>   Indexing doesn't leave much room for sages and seers, of course,
but their aggregate stock-picking record hasn't justified much faith.</TE>
<TE>   But what about Wall Street corruption? It's good that prosecutors
will be nailing crooks, but it's doubtful that politicians will have
much to offer, except red tape and press releases. Why? Because the
top-down bureaucratic culture of Washington gives pols little feel
for the risk-taking, corner-cutting nature of globally competitive
hypercapitalism.</TE>
<TE>   And meanwhile, for most Americans mindful of their financial
future, the real problem is that the bull market of the '80s and '90s
is over.</TE>
<TE>   Government-imposed "reforms" won't make Wall Streeters smarter or
investors richer, as the overpriced market moves back down to
historically normal levels. Now if it really dips, who should be
indicted?</TE>

<HD>Flicking Fallen Angels Off the Head of a Pin</HD>
<DH>A force for good is bogged down in a sexual morass of its
own making.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Never did I expect to feel sorrow and pity for the Catholic Church,
yet I confess that I do. The first reports of this latest round of
scandal could be absorbed as gossipy and ironic reminders of the
hypocrisy and all-too-human frailty of the most sanctimonious among
us.</LD>
<LD>   However, now that the tales of sad sickness spew forth so
unrelentingly, even a non-Catholic can recognize the staggering pain
of the victims while also mourning the church's lost dignity, which
it might never recover.</LD>
<LD>   For all its deep flaws, the American Catholic Church has been a
valuable institution, providing support for the poor and prodding the
rich to give back to society.</LD>
<TE>   The loss of the church's moral authority and organizational
effectiveness will be felt most acutely in this country by those on
the margins--exploited immigrants, poor working families, poorly
represented men and women on death row--for whom it was an important
and, at times, unique ally. But the church as an important moral
force in our secular society will end if it cannot climb out of the
terrible sexual morass that is its medieval legacy.</TE>
<TE>   By confusing repression with propriety, the church long ago
blurred the distinction between the sexual behavior of consenting
adults and that which is coercive and illegal. When church officials
consistently concealed the heinous crime of molestation, they failed
to "render unto Caesar" respect for the laws of men.</TE>
<TE>   Who in the church hierarchy didn't know that to avoid reporting
knowledge of such crimes, whether committed by stranger, parent or
priest, is often itself a crime--and always morally repugnant
cowardice?</TE>
<TE>   That church leaders thought themselves above the law reflects the
arrogance of those who presume that they alone know the path of moral
rectitude. It is an arrogance long exhibited by the church in its
myriad attempts to protect the morals of even non-Catholics, by
censoring books and movies, for example, and by dictating government
birth-control policy.</TE>
<TE>   All this in the name of a moral propriety that the church itself
cannot sustain; a repressive sexual climate, apparently, does not a
sinner save.</TE>
<TE>   The church has long been a major opponent of sex education for the
young, arguing that a frank discussion of sex would lead the innocent
astray. Yet Catholic seminaries, certainly prime testing grounds for
the stern moral lectures the church advocates for educating the
general public, have proved a most fertile ground for the growth of
sexual appetites that are truly destructive.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the preaching of sexual abstinence, the church's main
weapon in the fight against sexually transmitted diseases and teenage
pregnancy, obviously didn't work for highly motivated priests who had
taken a vow of celibacy. Indeed, the main lesson of all this tawdry
behavior is that denying oneself healthy sexual outlets may be the
surest path to illegal perversion.</TE>
<TE>   What hypocrisy that predatory priests were on the front lines of
the church's endless crusades against such simple lifesavers as
condom distribution, as well as the fundamental human rights of women
to make their own decisions about their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Should a 15-year-old be required to carry to term an egg
fertilized by a condomless priest as an expression, as the church
teaches, of God's will?</TE>
<TE>   The ugliest side of the bishops' defense is to blame the problem
of abuse on a failure to better screen out homosexuals from the ranks
of the priesthood. The notion that homosexuals are more likely to
break the law and abuse the young not only flies in the face of
social science research, it also has been contradicted by the ample
evidence of heterosexual abuse by priests.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout its history, the church has sustained life for many
when not sabotaged by its arrogance; it is at its best when humbly
fulfilling its responsibility to serve the least among us, be they
economically or sexually exploited. It is at its worst when
attempting to confine the human experience to a prison constructed of
archaic and contradictory nostrums that bear no relation to modern
life or the internal practices of the church itself.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a God of the type worshiped by the faithful, this will
all be sorted out in some final accounting of sins and sinners, and I
leave it to those who claim divine inspiration to flick the fallen
angels off the head of the pin.</TE>
<TE>   But as a non-Catholic, I do hope this ancient institution can
regenerate itself while sloughing off the paralyzing accretion of
centuries of pompous judgment, arcane intellectualism and medieval
secrecy.</TE>

<LD>Yes! The threat of enforced thumb twiddling has been lifted. Without
much fanfare, the Los Angeles Superior Court has done something that
almost everyone, including its own judges, thought impossible:
replaced 10-day jury service with the requirement that citizens serve
one day or one trial.</LD>
<LD>   For the system to work, however, everyone has to shoulder his or
her new, far less onerous responsibility. That's why a state bill to
let new categories of peace officers off the hook deserves defeat.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles, prospective jurors now are on call by phone for up
to five days and are required to report to a courthouse only one day.
If they're assigned to a trial on that day, they serve until the end
of the trial. If they're not assigned on the day they report in,
their service is over. Even the crowded downtown civil and criminal
courts have made the switch. No more scrambling for a seat in stuffy
jury assembly rooms, watching Korean soap operas or fumbling with
jigsaw puzzles of playful kittens day after excruciating day.</LD>
<TE>   With 480 judges, Los Angeles has the largest trial court in the
free world. It needs 10,000 people on hand every day to provide
enough qualified jurors. In 1988, the Legislature did away with rules
that excused doctors, the self-employed and even judges from jury
service. The court still can excuse someone if service would truly
constitute a hardship to the juror or the public. State law exempts
sheriff's deputies and police and Highway Patrol officers under the
theory that lawyers will routinely excuse them anyway--a claim not
borne out by studies--and that their absence from their posts
jeopardizes public safety.</TE>
<TE>   The exemption owes much to the clout of peace officers unions, and
those same unions are pushing to expand that exemption. AB 1970,
introduced by Assembly member Barbara Matthews (D-Tracy), would
categorically excuse parole and probation officers and prison guards.
Her bill whisked through the Assembly last month and is scheduled to
come before the Senate Public Safety Committee today.</TE>
<TE>   But AB 1970 just compounds one bad idea with another. Parole
officers are no more vital than, say, county foster-care workers or
classroom teachers, who aren't automatically excused from service.
And prison guards, as a group, are no less appropriate as jurors in
civil trials than county prosecutors, who aren't excused.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there will always be reasons to exclude certain people
from serving as jurors on certain cases. But to run smoothly, the new
system needs a new throng of prospective jurors every day, which is
why those exclusions should be made in the courtroom, not in the
Legislature.</TE>

<LD>As terrorist threats mount, the United States has responded through
its defense policies. President Bush's proposal to strengthen the
Homeland Security Office is a sizable shift that makes good sense.
U.S. international defense policy since World War II is a touchier
issue, however. It has depended on collaboration with NATO, the
United Nations and other treaty organizations. That bedrock should
remain.</LD>
<LD>   Bush has made tentative steps toward a more preemptive policy for
months, saying the U.S. must respond to threats before they are
carried out. In urgent, specific cases such as attacking terrorist
training camps, that's fair enough. But his call in a speech Friday
for a new doctrine of preemptive attacks against potential
threats--maybe Iraq today, yet conceivably any troublesome
nation--goes too far in making the U.S. a power answerable only to
itself.</LD>
<LD>   Before Sept. 11, the president and his advisors said openly that,
in contrast with the Clinton administration, they had more faith in
the might of the United States than in international institutions
like the United Nations. But after Sept. 11, Bush of necessity
changed course.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. worked with NATO to coordinate intelligence and to obtain
U.N. Security Council approval for the attack on the Taliban.
Cooperation existed only because the U.S. had worked for half a
century to build an international community that shares common values
about the right to self-defense and opposition to aggressive wars. It
is this very community that the Soviet Union, no longer a Cold War
enemy, is now joining.</TE>
<TE>   President Reagan, in justifying the U.S. bombing of Libya in April
1986, referred to the right of self-defense codified in Article 51 of
the United Nations. The first President Bush sought and received the
approval of the Security Council for the Gulf War. In this and other
instances, including the war in Afghanistan, the U.S. has sought
collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, however, has in recent speeches championed a right
to go-it-alone action wherever a threat is perceived.</TE>
<TE>   Along those lines, Bush reportedly has authorized funding of Iraqi
opposition groups and CIA infiltration of Iraq, both eminently
justifiable because of Iraq's defiance of U.N. weapons inspection.
But beyond that lies the possibility of assassination or unilateral
military action to topple Saddam Hussein. Even Kuwait, invaded by
Iraq in 1990, has opposed that.</TE>
<TE>   The president appears to want a vague authority that allows a
preemptive war against terrorists--or nations. This enshrining of
unilateralism will obviously antagonize allies. And other
countries--for instance, India or China--could attack a neighbor and
say that, like the U.S., they were acting defensively.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is right to test new policies to confront
terrorism. But the fight requires diplomacy and good intelligence
work, not just firepower that could blow up in America's face.</TE>

<LD>A fast break by the right wing, a clever flick of a pass at the near
post and a blistering right-footed shot that made the net tremble.
This sporting scene and an equally exciting second goal initiated by
the left wing are being replayed in the minds of millions of midnight
viewers--almost all of whom were rooting for the other team.</LD>
<LD>   Ay! How the United States' historic victory over Mexico frustrates
futbol aficionados. The true believers who'll stay up all night and
then celebrate all day find it maddening to lose to a country that
sleeps as its team triumphs.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, this team without fans has climbed into the World Cup
quarterfinals. And we're not talking about the so-called World
Series, no matter how earthshaking a battle between the New York
Yankees and the Arizona Diamondbacks might seem to those who didn't
understand a word of this editorial's opening scene.</LD>
<TE>   No, while Americans mull over last season's Lakers videos, their
national team has, against all expectations, landed a berth among the
eight best teams in the only worldwide tournament for a single sport.</TE>
<TE>   True, Team USA does not play the beautiful game that defines
four-time champion Brazil (but then, no other country does). And the
U.S.' Major League Soccer is hardly on a par with the English Premier
League, the German Bundesliga, the Calcio Italiano or the Spanish
league. But only twice before has the U.S. made it beyond the World
Cup's first round--in 1930, in Uruguay, when the pool was made up of
only 13 teams, and in 1994, playing on home turf.</TE>
<TE>   This team's prowess is testament to the work of the American Youth
Soccer Organization and other leagues devoted to instilling in
American kids a love of this universal game. The budding culture of
soccer helps explain why Team USA forward Brian McBride and attacking
midfielder Landon Donovan seem so at home in the global soccer
environment.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks into the World Cup, defending champion France is home
licking its wounds, along with Argentina, Portugal and many other
seasoned teams that international experts had predicted would go far
in the tournament. Meanwhile, the American players keep going.</TE>
<TE>   Now Team USA will play three-time champion Germany in a
quarterfinal match. That alone is historic. But imagine what these
young athletes could do if a few more nonimmigrant Laker and Dodger
fans would join the Americans originally from Honduras, Argentina, El
Salvador, Iran, Pakistan--and, yes, Mexico--who will be cheering
loudly at 4:30 a.m. on Friday for Team USA.</TE>

<LD>Re "This Is War, and Military Justice Is Appropriate," Commentary,
June 14: Douglas Kmiec's history lesson and reasoning are persuasive
except for one critical point. His first sentence is, "We are at
war." But, in fact, we are not at war. Article I, Section 8, of the
Constitution is clear that "the Congress shall have power ... to
declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules
concerning Captures on Land and Water." That's Congress, not the
president.</LD>
<LD>   This was no accident. The founders wanted to make sure that no one
man could define the existence, scope and duration of war. If George
W. Bush wants to exercise extraordinary powers, let him go before the
people's representatives and make his case for a declaration of war.
Until Congress makes such a declaration, Bush's use of military
justice against Jose Padilla is beyond his authority.</LD>
<LD>   Personally, I wish Congress would declare war. Then we the people
would be having our say in who can decrease certain of our rights,
how they can be decreased and for how long. And vermin like Padilla
could be dealt with in a way that is true to the system we're all
trying to protect. C'mon, Mr. President. Have the guts to do it
right.</LD>

<TE>   Kmiec deftly reiterates that "the Constitution is not a suicide
pact." I would suggest it is a pact with those who have died for it.
What amount of fear and what national purpose are served by the
suspension of due process? The strictest scrutiny does not justify
holding a citizen incommunicado and without an indictment.</TE>
<TE>   How broad is Kmiec's constitutional analysis? Does this extend to
antiabortionists who are engaged in what they see as "God's holy war
to save the unborn"? Does it extend to gun-toting survivalists who
see themselves at war with the federal government? Or is this type of
self-serving reasoning just what the Constitution intended to
prevent?</TE>
<TE>   Due process is what separates us from those who would harm us. We
cannot bow to evil because of fear. Is it still OK to say, "Give me
liberty or give me death"?</TE>

<TE>   When one joins the forces of a foreign army one is deemed to have

detainment. Padilla does have rights, though, and he should be
afforded all the privileges of any other person attempting to kill us
all and destroy our civilization.</TE>

<HD>Bishops' Abuse Policy: Are They Truly Sorry?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "U.S. Bishops Adopt Policy on Sex Abuse," June 15: The policy
adopted by the Catholic bishops is unacceptable. It is time for U.S.
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft to impanel a federal grand jury to
investigate the American Roman Catholic Church for conspiracy to
commit child molestation, conspiracy to harbor child molesters,
aiding and abetting known criminals (priests who molest children) and
conducting a pattern and practice of violating the civil rights of
children in the church by allowing priests who molested children to
continue.</LD>
<LD>   Child abuse is a crime. For the priests to say it is OK for a
priest to abuse one person without facing severe discipline is wrong.
I cannot give my money to a church that condones child sexual abuse
and child molestation. While I have not decided to leave the church
altogether, I am definitely withholding my financial support,
effective today.</LD>
<LD>   Victoria B. Pipkin</LD>
<TE>   Inglewood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like a song that you can't get off your mind, I keep replaying two
themes as I read each day's iterations of sexual abuse instances in
the Catholic Church: a wink-and-a-nod disingenuousness (e.g., Claude
Rains' famous "I'm shocked, shocked" to hear that there's gambling
going on at Rick's, from "Casablanca") and overwhelming amorality
(e.g., the Germans after WWII who had "no idea" of what was going on
in the neighboring concentration camps).</TE>
<TE>   The church's hierarchy continues to appear primarily
self-protecting, focused on forgiveness and redemption of its own
while seemingly blind and/or unmoved by the suffering caused.
However, the rest of the community understands that reportable crimes
have been committed and covered up. Small wonder that so many,
Catholics and non-Catholics, are deeply saddened and revolted by the
church's response.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If a teacher is convicted of sexually abusing a student he will
lose his teaching credential and will be prohibited from teaching for
the rest of his life. Why should pedophile priests be treated any
differently? The Catholic bishops' conference was analogous to
suspected criminals running their own trial--choosing their own
lawyers, judge and jury, plus voting for their own sentence of
punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Also, are the bishops truly sorry for sexual abuse victims or are
they sorry that they were exposed by the news media?</TE>

<HD>A Dad's Disappointment Hurt His Gay Son</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank you for running Jeff Ellis' poignant and heartfelt June 14
commentary, "Father Knows Best--Sometimes It Just Takes Him Awhile."
I was just discussing with a gay friend how much of a disappointment
I felt I was to my dad while growing up and what an embarrassment I
felt I was to my family. I became a jock in grammar school, a
"straight A" student in high school and then a doctor. Yet, unfair as
it seemed to me, I still felt like a disappointment to everyone,
myself included.</LD>
<LD>   That feeling kept me in the closet a long, long time, and that was
not good for my psyche. Ellis expressed what a lot of dads and others
have been afraid to admit: that they were--and too many still
are--disappointed in their gay children. How could they not be? Our
culture insists on it!</LD>
<LD>   Maybe someday soon having a gay child, even if it is your only
child, will not be an occasion for shame or disappointment. I and
millions like me can hardly wait.</LD>

<HD>School's Closing Teaches a Sad Lesson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was profoundly saddened to read that Bellagio Road Newcomer Center
would be closing this month ("Special School for Immigrants to
Close," June 13). I was on the original committee to develop the
Newcomer Center. Over the years I had the opportunity to work with
especially caring teachers, counselors and nurses dedicated to giving
newly arrived immigrants the right academic start in their adopted
country.</LD>
<LD>   Children arrived in September quiet and a little awed by the
beautiful American school in the canyon. I saw them progress from
practicing shy, halting "Good mornings" to delivering graduating
speeches in English in June. There were almost no discipline problems
or playground fights. It was the kind of school where children were
unhappy to leave on Fridays or for long holidays. Graduates returned
to thank their teachers for giving them the confidence and necessary
introduction to U.S. schooling.</LD>
<LD>   When will the community realize that immigrant children are not
the problem of urban education but the hope? It's too bad that school
board member Marlene Canter is catering to a privileged constituency,
enticing them back to public school in Bel-Air. It's a shame that
more people don't have the social conscience or vision to realize the
benefits that could be achieved by sharing the wealth and having
charter and Newcomer students learn together.</LD>

<LD>Re "Unit Takes Aim at Illegal Guns," June 14: I find it appalling and
a total waste of resources for L.A. City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo to

regulated and licensed gun dealers in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   If Delgadillo really wants to do something to curb gun violence
perhaps he should consider cooperating with the Immigration and

he inherited had cost California taxpayers only $122 million, the
state would be in much better fiscal shape than it is today.</LD>

<HD>Ignoring the Past of Castro's Cuba</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How can Wayne Smith state that the Castro regime is not terrorist
("Fidel Castro Is No Osama bin Laden," Opinion, June 16)? Since the
beginning, Fidel Castro's struggle to win power in Cuba relied on
terrorism. Bombs planted in public places were a staple of Castro's
struggle in the 1950s, killing or maiming many innocent civilians in
Cuba. Starting in the early 1960s, leaders of most every subversive
group in Latin America were trained in Cuba in the methods of terror.
Those leaders then went on to train followers in their countries,
spreading what they learned in Castro's training camps, in what is no
doubt the greatest terror-training program our hemisphere has seen.</LD>
<LD>   From Guatemala to Argentina, thousands of innocent civilians were
killed during the past 40 years as a result of Cuban-sponsored
training in the methods of terror. The recent link-up between the
terrorist Irish Republican Army and Colombia's narco-guerrillas could
not have occurred without Cuba's mediation. Similarly, the link
between Spain's Basque terrorists and the Castro regime has provided
their organization with a valuable base.</LD>
<TE>   Books and reports have been written on the Castro regime's
terror-training programs during the past four decades by former Cuban
intelligence officials. Smith would do well to take a look at their
accounts and stop trying to be an apologist for the Castro regime's
long history of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Louis Swires</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For years Smith has been playing the same tune. What is he trying
to do? Convince the world that Castro is a benevolent tyrant? While
his arguments are open for discussion, the truth remains that Cubans
are not free to choose their own destiny or enjoy any of the rights
we all have in a democracy.</TE>
<TE>   In two years, the American voter will be able to elect a new
president. In Cuba, on June 13, Castro announced a campaign to
declare his political, social and economic system "untouchable."</TE>

<LD>"Karzai Chosen as Leader, Vows to Rebuild Nation" (June 14) states
that Afghanistan's loya jirga [grand assembly] "has fallen far short
of what Westerners would regard as an exercise in democracy. Some
delegates won their seats through bribery, threats or favor-trading."</LD>
<LD>   I don't know what planet your reporters are living on, but it is
quite evident to me that bribery, threats and favor-trading are all
that remain of democracy in the West. Isn't a "campaign contribution"
just a euphemism for a pre-paid bribe? Surely you understand that
behind-the-scenes threats and favor-trading are major "tools of the
trade" in shaping public policy at the local, state and national
levels. You cannot be that naive; let's get with the program.</LD>

<HD>Simon Blames Davis for Rise in Crime Rate</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP candidate picks up backing from law
enforcement group, then challenges governor on what some say is an
unassailable position.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. blamed Gov. Gray
Davis on Monday for the state's rise in crime--attempting to turn one
of the incumbent's showcase issues against him.</LD>
<LD>   Simon, a former federal prosecutor, said the increase in crime was
a sign of his Democratic rival's "complete neglect of his
responsibilities as governor."</LD>
<LD>   "Gov. Davis views public safety purely and simply as a political
issue," Simon said. "For him, being tough on crime is a poll-tested,
calculated position taken to benefit his campaign."</LD>
<TE>   Simon cited state statistics showing that crime in California rose
3.5% in 2000 and 5.8% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's remarks at a Burbank hotel were part of a statewide tour
by the nominee to trumpet his first law enforcement endorsement: the
California Organization of Police and Sheriffs, known as COPS. It had
previously endorsed Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' law enforcement supporters include 12 police chiefs, nine
district attorneys, six county sheriffs, and 21 unions and other
public safety groups.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an issue on which you're going to take down Gray
Davis," said Garry South, chief strategist of the governor's
reelection campaign. "If he wants to try to make this campaign about
how Gray Davis let down the state on crime, that's a non-starter."
South also challenged the strength of Simon's own record as an
assistant U.S. attorney in New York during the 1980s. "Gray Davis has
kept a hell of a lot more people behind bars than Bill Simon ever put
there," South said.</TE>
<TE>   Although public safety is traditionally a strong issue for GOP
candidates, Davis has fought hard to inoculate himself against any
charge that he is soft on crime. He supports the death penalty, and
has blocked the parole release of all but two of the convicted
killers whose cases he has reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the first television ads of his general-election
campaign, Davis says he "cracked down on gangs and fought against the
early release of criminals." The ad is running in the Central Valley,
an area where Davis has emphasized his record on crime to appeal to
socially conservative voters.</TE>
<TE>   GOP pollster Dick Dresner said it seemed "farfetched" to try to
gain ground by depicting Davis as soft on crime, all the more so when
polls show it is not one of the public's top concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very tough against Davis, because Davis is very conservative
on crime, and he's got all of the law enforcement endorsements,"
Dresner said. "I just don't see it as a weakness" for Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Simon tried to make the most of his endorsement by COPS
with announcements in Sacramento, Bakersfield, Burbank and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said the crime trend was "one more sign of Gray Davis'
failed leadership," along with energy, education, the economy and
state budget.</TE>
<TE>   "Across America, crime continues to drop towards historic lows,"
Simon said in Burbank. "Yet here in California crime is rising for
two years running on the Gray Davis watch."</TE>
<TE>   An aide, Jeff Flint, cited federal statistics showing a drop in
crime nationwide in 2000 and the first six months of 2001, but said
the campaign had no figures for the second half of 2001. The U.S.
Department of Justice has not released its annual report on crime for
2001.</TE>
<TE>   At each stop on his statewide tour, Simon also ran through figures
showing crime rising locally. He said in Burbank that murder, rape
and auto theft had all gone up in Los Angeles since Davis took office
in 1999. Simon also pointed to an increase in gang-related violence
in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   During the Republican primary, Davis used some of those same Los
Angeles statistics to show that crime had risen when GOP
gubernatorial candidate Richard Riordan was mayor. Davis also used
the Los Angeles figures in a television ad aired mainly in the
Central Valley.</TE>

<HD>Nonprescription Sale of Needles to Be Considered</HD>
<DH>Health: Bill would allow adults to buy up to 30 at
pharmacies. Backers say it would help combat illness; foes say drug
users would benefit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NERISSA PACIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill to be considered by the Assembly Health Committee today would
allow adults 18 and older to buy up to 30 hypodermic needles or
syringes at licensed pharmacies without a doctor's prescription.</LD>
<LD>   "The purpose of the bill is to save lives in California," said Sue
North, chief of staff for its author, state Sen. John Vasconcellos
(D-Santa Clara).</LD>
<LD>   The bill has passed in the Senate, although Gov. Gray Davis has
not taken a position on it. Supporters, including health-care
organizations and the pharmacy industry, said that allowing
over-the-counter needle and syringe sales would reduce the spread of
HIV and hepatitis B and C among drug users, saving millions of
dollars in health-care costs.</LD>
<TE>   State law now requires a prescription to buy needles unless they
are used to inject insulin or adrenaline.</TE>
<TE>   The law also requires a pharmacist to see valid identification and
keep a detailed record of nonprescription needle sales. California is
one of six states that require a prescription to buy a syringe.</TE>
<TE>   Lifting the prescription requirement would ease the demand on the
limited resources of needle-exchange programs, which operate mostly
under the jurisdiction of local governments and allow addicts to
exchange used needles for clean ones without a prescription, said
Sara Nichols, legislative advocate for the California Nurses Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the bill, mainly law enforcement organizations, argue
that it allows for easy access to needles and that it condones drug
use.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the policies of needle-exchange programs, the bill does not
mandate that dirty needles be brought in for new ones.</TE>
<TE>   "In a needle exchange, there's government oversight," said John
Lovell, legislative counsel for the California Narcotics Officers
Assn. "There you can do other things designed to intervene in
someone's drug habit. At Long's drugstore, Rite Aid, Walgreen's, or
the pharmacies in grocery stores, there is no oversight."</TE>
<TE>   North said the bill also would help those living in rural areas
who don't have access to needle exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Davis signed into law a measure allowing local
governments to approve needle-exchange programs only if the council
members or supervisors declared a "public health emergency."</TE>
<TE>   There are 23 programs in the state, of which 15 are legalized by
local government, said Ricky Bluthenthal, a sociologist at the Rand
Corp., a think tank in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Some drug users who use needle exchanges said the bill doesn't do
enough to prevent the spread of infectious disease.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe this program is good because you benefit from classes,"
said Jessica Olivas, 52, a heroin addict who has been coming to the
needle-exchange program at the Bienestar center in Boyle Heights for
five months.</TE>
<TE>   "Because you have to bring in old needles, it stops needles from
being in the trash where kids can get to them," Olivas said.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John A. Cella, 76, a chemist who guided development of the skin care
lines Visible Difference and Millennium for Elizabeth Arden, died
June 8 in San Diego of kidney failure.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Chicago, Cella earned his bachelor's degree at DePaul
University there and his doctorate at the University of Notre Dame.</LD>
<LD>   He spent most of his life in the Midwest, until his 1986
retirement from Elizabeth Arden, when he moved to San Diego and
became a consultant to various cosmetics companies.</LD>
<TE>   Cella first worked as a medical chemist for Armour &amp; Co. and in
1953 moved to G.D. Searle &amp; Co., where he helped develop Aldactone, a
diuretic now used to treat congestive heart failure. At Searle, he
also led development of a method to make Enovid, the first oral
contraceptive. He went on to serve as assistant to the president at
Julian Laboratories, a division of Smith, Kline &amp; French, and then
spent 10 years as a vice president at the Alberto Culver Co.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Elizabeth Arden in 1973, Cella brought the science of
chemistry to cosmetics. Providing the scientific foundation, he
formulated the skin care products Visible Difference and Millennium
to make skin smoother and younger-looking. He also created Lip Fix,
to make lipstick longer-lasting, formulated sun care products and
Chloe perfume, and invented computers to analyze skin types.</TE>

<DH>Courts: State experimenting with video kiosks to help
litigants file forms and get basic advice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When single father Thurman Williams needed help filling out papers in
a custody suit recently, he didn't look to his lawyer for help. He
walked to a computerized kiosk at the Lamoreaux Justice Center in
Orange and started tapping the keys.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a legal experiment, litigants without lawyers across
California are using computerized video kiosks to prepare common
court filings and seek basic legal advice.</LD>
<LD>   The kiosk used by Williams is part of a statewide effort to cope
with a flood of litigants who cannot afford or refuse to hire
lawyers. Court officials statewide fear the number of
self-represented litigants has reached crisis levels and threatens to
clog court calendars.</LD>
<TE>   Like Williams, more than 6,000 Orange County litigants have
initiated court actions on I-CAN! kiosks or accessed the programs on
the Internet, using home computers. Similar programs are operating in
Sacramento, San Diego and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study of the kiosks' first 18 months of operation
concluded it is too soon to tell if the system will relieve pressure
on court calendars. But the report, by UC Irvine's School of Social
Ecology, said users were overwhelmingly positive about the free legal
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's made life a lot easier for me," Williams said. "It's helped
keep me from going to the poorhouse."</TE>
<TE>   The 29-year-old Orange resident was directed to a kiosk in the
Lamoreaux Justice Center by court staff. After putting on headphones
and following the directions of a videotaped instructor, Williams
filled out a quarter-inch stack of paternity and custody documents.
The exercise took 20 minutes; it would have cost him about $800 if he
had relied on a lawyer, he said. "It was a lot easier than I
thought."</TE>
<TE>   Whether they can't afford a lawyer or just want to save money,
more Californians are going to court without a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just amazed at the numbers," said Commissioner Salvador
Sarmiento, who hears between 40 and 90 child-support cases a day in
Lamoreaux Justice Center. "Eighty percent of the cases I hear involve
people representing themselves. These cases can take 50% longer to
process than others."</TE>
<TE>   Sarmiento said the kiosks have put many cases on the fast track.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people who appear before me without attorneys are real
nervous," Sarmiento said. "They don't know what to expect and they
want to tell me everything. It's an opportunity for them to vent. A
lot of what they say is irrelevant. When they go to the kiosks
though, I get the information that I need so I can rule."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 4.3 million state residents who find themselves in court
each year, more than half are pro per, or self-represented litigants.
The phenomenon is particularly evident in family courts, where fewer
than 16% of all child-support cases involve parents who are both
represented by lawyers. Also, 80% of all domestic-violence cases are
handled without lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   The State Bar of California has characterized the trend as "the
pro per crisis in family law" and the State Judicial Council has
established a task force on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature has attempted to address the problem by
establishing family-law facilitator offices throughout the state to
help litigants in child-support matters. In courts such as Orange
County's, the offices have offered workshops for litigants. Classes
often have two-month waiting lists.</TE>
<TE>   In Van Nuys, officials last year established the Self-Help Legal
Access Center, in which people can seek legal help from computers and
volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   I-CAN! Kiosks are in eight locations, including the Orange County
district attorney's office, Irvine City Hall and the Fullerton and
San Juan Capistrano libraries. However, the busiest location is in
the Lamoreaux Justice Center.</TE>
<TE>   At the Family Law Information Center, where open boxes of tissues
are displayed as prominently as forms for initiating divorce, custody
and child-support proceedings, office assistant Beatrice Contreras
said there is often a line of people waiting to use the two machines.</TE>
<TE>   Employing interactive video- and touch-screen technology, the
kiosks guide users through the bureaucracy of obtaining
domestic-violence restraining orders, establishing child custody,
responding to child support and eviction orders, initiating
small-claims suits and requesting waivers for legal filing fees.</TE>
<TE>   The kiosks give instructions in English, Spanish and Vietnamese
and offer users video tours of court complexes and primers on what to
expect during court hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "People like it because they say it's fast and easy and especially
because they don't have to pay for an attorney. They really like
that," Contreras said.</TE>
<TE>   There still are some bugs in the system. Among users' complaints:
the small, immobile keyboards are sometimes difficult to use, and the
touch screens have to be tapped in just the right way.</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly it's good comments though," Contreras said. "People will
come in here very confused and very sad and not know what to do. Once
they work with the computer and finish, you can tell they're not as
sad. They're glad that they're getting some help."</TE>
<TE>(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>

<HD>Scott Shuger, 50; Internet Journalism Pioneer, Columnist
for MSN's Slate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scott Shuger, an influential figure in online journalism as the first
writer and editor of the "Today's Papers" column for Microsoft's
online newsmagazine Slate, has died. He was 50.</LD>
<LD>   An experienced scuba diver, Shuger died Saturday in the ocean off
the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Details of the accident were sketchy, and
the cause of his death will be determined by an autopsy.</LD>
<LD>   Begun by Shuger in 1997, the "Today's Papers" column offers
summaries and critiques of the major news stories in the five leading
American newspapers: the Los Angeles Times, New York Times, USA
Today, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post.</LD>
<TE>   Shuger's column was sent out to leading figures in American
journalism and politics who were interested in tracking the
performance of the print media and had a wide following.</TE>
<TE>   "It became for many people indispensable in their lives," said
Larry Pryor, a professor of Journalism at USC's Annenberg School for
Communication. "His newsletter raised issues and problems in coverage
that even experienced newspeople don't automatically think of. It
helped me to think about how the news is playing out."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Baltimore, Shuger earned a bachelor's degree at Carleton
College in Minnesota and a doctorate in philosophy at Vanderbilt
University.</TE>
<TE>   After earning his doctorate, he joined the Navy and was in naval
intelligence from 1978 to 1983.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Michele Botwin for the Annenberg School of
Communication's Online Journalism Review, Shuger said that even
though he never worked for a newspaper, his Navy career gave him a
strong background in reporting.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that's great about the Navy is that there's a
tremendous emphasis on accurate information, quickly," he said. "I
worked on admiral staffs where pretty high-powered people wanted
stuff 'now,' and I had to get it from people who weren't necessarily
happy to give it to me."</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the Navy, Shuger found work as an editor and writer
with the Washington Monthly from 1989 to 1991.</TE>
<TE>   When his wife took a professorship in medieval studies at UCLA,
Shuger left the Washington Monthly and found work as a freelance
writer and producer developing stories for ABC News.</TE>
<TE>   His introduction to online journalism was as a book reviewer for
Amazon.com in the mid-1990s. He went to work for Slate in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Shuger was reassigned to new
duties covering the war on terrorism with a column called "War
Stories," which brought his naval intelligence background into play.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a pioneer in the fact that he created an audience of
regular readers turning to his column online as a news source," said
Botwin, who is now an editor at the Los Angeles Times' Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Shuger is survived by his wife, Debra; a daughter, Dale, a Harvard
University graduate who is now a graduate student at New York
University; his parents, Sewell and Virginia Shuger of Baltimore; and
two sisters, Nancy of Baltimore and Lisa Shuger Hublitz of McLean,
Va.</TE>

<HD>R. Whitehead, 86; Producer of Respected Broadway Plays</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Whitehead, known as Broadway's "Mister Class" for his dapper
personage and habit of producing top-quality plays by such classic
writers as Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neill, has
died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Whitehead, who received a special Tony award earlier this month
for his nearly six decades of contributions to theater, died Saturday
of cancer at his home in Pound Ridge, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran producer was known for attaining the rare twin peaks
of artistic and commercial success on Broadway, London's West End, in
his native Canada and occasionally on Los Angeles stages.</LD>
<TE>   Whitehead burst onto Broadway in 1947 with his daring production
of Robinson Jeffers' version of "Medea," starring Judith Anderson and
John Gielgud. He followed "Medea" with Dostoevsky's "Crime and
Punishment," starring Gielgud and Lillian Gish. Despite their classic
literary roots, both plays were financially successful, and Whitehead
quickly established himself as a man who could make high quality pay.</TE>
<TE>   A Times theater writer once described Whitehead as "one of the
most eminent figures in the American theater, a producer whose taste
and sensitivity and judgment are respected wherever actors prate upon
a stage."</TE>
<TE>   Among the scores of Whitehead productions have been Carson
McCullers' "Member of the Wedding" in 1950 starring Julie Harris and
Ethel Waters; William Inge's "Bus Stop" in 1955; and "A Man for All
Seasons," starring Paul Scofield in 1961. Whitehead produced much of
Miller's later Broadway work, including "The Price" in 1968, "The
Creation of the World and Other Business" in 1972, the celebrated
revival of "Death of a Salesman," starring Dustin Hoffman, in 1984
and "Broken Glass" in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   In a single season--1957--Whitehead had five plays running on
Broadway simultaneously--"Separate Tables," "Orpheus Descending,"
"The Waltz of the Toreadors," "A Hole in the Head" and "Major
Barbara."</TE>
<TE>   More recent works included Terrence McNally's "Master Class"
starring Whitehead's second wife, Australian actress Zoe Caldwell, as
the diva Maria Callas. The production won the Tony as best play of
1996 and was presented at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Not everything Whitehead touched, however, turned into instant
success. He had no luck with musicals, for example, and one
particular flop, a 1976 collaboration of Leonard Bernstein and Alan
Jay Lerner called "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue" folded after one week.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps Whitehead's greatest personal disappointment was his
effort to create a national repertory theater for the United States
akin to Britain's National Theater or France's Comedie Francaise.</TE>
<TE>   In 1960, Whitehead and director Elia Kazan were appointed to head
the first Lincoln Center Repertory Theater. They opened in temporary
quarters in 1964 with Miller's then-new play "After the Fall,"
starring Jason Robards, which proved a disappointment in the
expectation-charged atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Their subsequent productions--O'Neill's "Marco Millions," S.N.
Behrman's "But for Whom Charlie," the Jacobean classic "The
Changeling" and Miller's "Incident at Vichy"--fared no better.
Whitehead and Kazan were ousted in a bitter brouhaha with the theater
board.</TE>
<TE>   Whitehead said little publicly about the failure of the project
for which he had such high hopes. But he remained convinced that
public repertory theater was worth pursuing, and, with that in mind,
became an advisor to the Center Theatre Group as the Los Angeles
Music Center was being created.</TE>
<TE>   "If they need me, they've got me," he said of his advisory
arrangement with the resident company to The Times in 1967. He had
tramped through the construction sites as the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion, the Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theater were built,
taking particular delight in the 750-seat Mark Taper Forum.</TE>
<TE>   When the small theater opened, Whitehead produced "The Sorrows of
Frederick" there and arranged for a subsequent production of the
well-received "In the Case of J. Robert Oppenheimer," about the
father of the atomic bomb.</TE>
<TE>   During his early involvement with the Music Center, Whitehead
discussed with The Times the problems he encountered at Lincoln
Center endemic in all public theater--the need to "spend all your
time in politics, going up corridors to meetings about money," which,
he said, killed the creative process.</TE>
<TE>   Whitehead remained convinced, as he proved repeatedly on Broadway,
that artistic theater could be commercially successful, even as he
advocated public subsidies for repertory companies.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that counts in theater is what happens on that
stage when the curtain goes up," he told The Times in 1967. "Nobody
is interested in how you did it, just the end result. So all your
energies should be concentrated there, not in endless, useless
meetings held because of an erroneous initial concept of a
self-supporting operation.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, I love dirty old show business," added the man who at the
time was about to open "The Price" and "The Prime of Miss Jean
Brodie" on Broadway. "I have always tried to achieve a continuity of
quality and style in my productions, to build a body of work, not
simply just put on one show and look around for another to put on.
But it still doesn't get you what you can get out of a company in
repertory, where you can build that kind of marvelous theater that
you get with 'The Dance of Death' one night and 'A Flea in Her Ear'
the next."</TE>
<TE>   Born March 3, 1916, in Montreal to a textile mill-owning father
and opera singer mother, Whitehead attended Trinity College School
there then moved to New York to work in theater, initially as an
actor. He spent World War II in the American Field Service as an
ambulance driver in North Africa and Italy. After the war, he
returned briefly to acting but quickly decided that he wanted to
become a producer.</TE>
<TE>   Widowed by the death of his first wife, Virginia, in 1965,
Whitehead three years later married Caldwell.</TE>
<TE>   They had been introduced by his cousin, actor Hume Cronyn.
Whitehead starred Caldwell in "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" as well
as "Master Class" and directed her in a revival of "Medea" and in the
one-woman show about Lillian Hellman called "Lillian."</TE>
<TE>   Whitehead is survived by Caldwell, and by their sons, Sam and
Charlie. Funeral services are private.</TE>

<HD>City Wants to See Through Doors of Massage Facilities</HD>
<DH>Law: Lake Forest officials say windows would discourage
prostitution. Foes decry the proposal as an invasion of privacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposal in the South Orange County city of Lake Forest would
require windows in the doorways to rooms in massage parlors, the
better to see exactly what customers are getting for their money.</LD>
<LD>   Massage devotees say that would leave them exposed. Supporters say
that's the idea.</LD>
<LD>   Citing problems with massage parlors during the last three years,
city officials drafted guidelines to bolster the city's existing
ordinance. Two years ago, police arrested four masseuses from the
Body Centre on charges of solicitation of prostitution. Such conduct
is less likely to occur if the massage rooms can be observed and
subject to inspection by police, a city report maintains.</LD>
<TE>   "It's doing two things--it's making sure the massage therapist is
in a safe environment and that the patrons coming in understand that
there should not be an expectation of privacy," said Mayor Richard
Dixon. "I'm disappointed that there are people in the industry who
are not embracing this. Frankly, I don't understand the concern."</TE>
<TE>   Massage clients argue such a mandate would penalize all massage
establishments for the illicit acts of just a few.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ridiculous," said Marshall Linn, 61, who receives
therapeutic massages every week as rehabilitation after spinal
surgery. "There is nothing here to hide, so it serves no purpose."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal also suggests enforcing a dress code: Shirt sleeves
would have to be at least 2 inches; skirts could be no shorter than 2
inches above the knee, or 6 inches for shorts. It also would require
massage parlor owners to post signs informing clients that they may
be subject to surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   "If I walked in for the first time and saw that sign, I would
question what type of place this is," said Linn, a Laguna Beach
resident whose surgeon referred him to the Center for Muscular
Therapy in Lake Forest. "Would I go into my doctor's office and be
subject to inspection? It's an invasion of privacy."</TE>
<TE>   He is not alone. The center's owner, Angella Conrard, has gathered
testimonials from more than half a dozen clients who say they're
offended by the proposal. And at least a dozen massage therapists are
expected to attend tonight's City Council meeting to protest the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an invasion of privacy," said Russell Antol, a Los Angeles
County firefighter who has been a client of Conrard's for three
years. "There are instances when I have hurt my back, and I'm not
going there for any reason other than to receive professional care.
I'm going there to address a particular issue, and I'm not there to
share it with the world."</TE>
<TE>   Cities have worked to curb the use of such establishments as
fronts for prostitution. But few have gone so far as to require
windows in the rooms, said Mark Dixon of the National Certification
Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Fullerton officials began requiring peepholes in
doors to massage rooms. Officials credit the law for weeding out
illegal operations.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't been challenged," said Gregory P. Palmer, Fullerton's
deputy city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "By and large, it's been successful. We started out with 32
massage parlors, and we now have 11."</TE>
<TE>   Massage therapists Conrard and Mark Dixon agree many of the laws
are good. They support licensing and education requirements, already
elements of Lake Forest's ordinance. Conrard said she doesn't even
mind the proposed dress code, but the windows and signs go too far.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine a teenage cheerleader with a groin pull coming in and
seeing that sign," Conrard said. "She'd be horrified."</TE>

<HD>Record Sales in May Push Home Prices Higher</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Strong demand and a shortage of units in
Ventura County spur a buying spree. Surge could last through the
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even by the exaggerated standards of this boom year, Ventura County
home sales were off the chart last month, staunching talk of a
bursting real estate bubble that spooked analysts earlier in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   The county has probably never had more condo and home sales in May
than it did for the month this year, said DataQuick Information
Systems analyst John Karevoll.</LD>
<LD>   And in setting a price record, the cost of a typical home moved
$49,000 higher than in May 2001.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm pretty sure it's a record May," said Karevoll, since last
month's sales of 1,661 exceeded the 1988 county benchmark by 106
units. "The only thing that surprises me these days is that so many
people are still surprised by this market."</TE>
<TE>   Even the most cautious experts have stopped describing the market
run-up as a bubble that is bound to pop, or at least deflate.</TE>
<TE>   Now they say the shortage of housing supply and the strength of
buyer demand could easily fuel a surge through the end of the
year--if mortgage interest rates stay low.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still seeing multiple offers and we're still seeing bidding
wars," said Karen Campbell, president of the Ventura County Coastal
Assn. of Realtors, which represents agents in six west county cities.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm conservative. I like to see the real picture, instead of
saying your house is going to appreciate $50,000 next month,"
Campbell said. "But I don't see it slowing down any time soon."</TE>
<TE>   The near-panic of customers afraid they'll miss a lower-priced
house continued through May, pushing the county's median cost to
$322,000, up $5,000 in a month and $38,000 since January.</TE>
<TE>   The median point is where half the houses cost more and half less.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, sales last month were the highest since last August's
peak of 1,748, which was the highest monthly total since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always cautious, but I believe it's sustainable," said Peter
Greer, president-elect of the Conejo Valley Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   "I sure don't think it's going to bust, anyway. I think it will
continue to be strong. New listings still are not jumping, and buyers
are coming out of the woodwork."</TE>
<TE>   A Conejo Valley home stays on the market an average 26 days before
it's sold, the fastest turnaround Greer can remember.</TE>
<TE>   In the west county, a house's market time dropped from 38 days in
April to 36 in May.</TE>
<TE>   Condos, a drag on the market for years, sold in an average of 24
days in May, down from 39 in April.</TE>
<TE>   "People are buying up condos like mad, because single-family homes
have just gone through the roof," said Jim Barroca, communications
manager for the coastal association.</TE>
<TE>   The number of available houses listed by Realtors in the Conejo
Valley remained at about 1,000, while west county listings increased
from 490 to 557.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers in affluent Oak Park, near the Los Angeles County line,
probably had the best month--selling 44% more homes at a 39% higher
price than a year ago. The typical home there now sells for $465,000,
up $130,000 from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The market also sizzled in east Camarillo, where home prices were
up $107,000 in a year; in Moorpark, where prices rose $90,000; and in
Fillmore, which had a $64,000 bump.</TE>
<TE>   Economist Mark Schniepp, director of California Economic Forecast,
said to expect the housing market to plateau within six months.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing is just like 1999 and 2000 in the [stock]
market," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody could quite believe the run-up, and we knew it would end.
This will, too. We all have this gut feeling that this is not right."</TE>
<TE>   The bubble won't burst, he said, because this market is driven by
lack of supply and high demand.</TE>
<TE>   But the market will level out, because jobs are being created at a
slower pace and people are finding other alternatives, such as buying
cheaper homes in more distant areas and commuting to work in this
county.</TE>
<TE>   "I can guarantee you 100% that prices cannot continue to rise
$50,000 year-to-year," Schniepp said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not sustainable."</TE>

<HD>Hahn Expected to Oppose Project</HD>
<DH>Development: At event today, mayor will likely join
coalition fighting Ahmanson Ranch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn is expected to join opponents of the
Ahmanson Ranch development today to decry the Ventura County
project's potential effect on Los Angeles traffic and air quality,
according to city officials and activists.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor is scheduled to join the coalition of politicians,
environmentalists and Hollywood celebrities opposed to Washington
Mutual's $2-billion development during an announcement at the Sherman
Oaks Galleria. Others expected include actor-director Rob Reiner,
City Councilman Dennis Zine, Ventura County Supervisor-elect Linda
Parks and community leaders from the West Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn has not taken a public stand on the development. The Ahmanson
Ranch project is proposed for land entirely in Ventura County, but it
abuts the San Fernando Valley and its opponents say most of the
people moving in would commute to Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Project opponents said Hahn will make his announcement at a
shopping mall that sits at the interchange of the 101 and 405
freeways, a bottleneck that they say would become more congested if
3,050 homes were built in the Simi Hills near Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills resident Joe Behar, who will be among the community
leaders at the Galleria, said he wrote to the mayor less than two
weeks ago to ask him to join the opposition to Ahmanson Ranch. Hahn's
quick response was surprising, Behar said. But given Hahn's desire to
fend off secessionists in the Valley, Behar understood.</TE>
<TE>   "If this development can be stopped," he said, "it would
definitely show a great intent on the part of the city to ... fight
to make sure the city and the Valley are one."</TE>

<HD>Freeway Rear-End Crash Kills 2</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men died late Sunday when their car was rear-ended and overturned
on the San Diego Freeway in Seal Beach, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The men were in a 1983 Toyota Cressida traveling north in the fast
lane when a 2001 Mercedes struck the car from behind, causing it to
roll over.</LD>
<LD>   The driver, Miguel Romera Garcia, 34, of Santa Ana, was declared
dead at the scene of the 11:15 p.m. crash just north of 7th Street.
His 40-year-old passenger also died at the scene. Officers said
Monday they were withholding his name pending notification of
relatives who live out of state. "We're not sure exactly how it
happened," said Officer Gary Goldenberg, a spokesman for the
California Highway Patrol. The Toyota, he said, "was going
extraordinarily slow."</LD>
<TE>   The driver of the Mercedes was a 17-year-old from Anaheim Hills.
She and two of her passengers--ages 15 and 17--were not injured. A
third passenger, a 19-year-old from Anaheim, had a minor knee injury
that paramedics treated.</TE>
<TE>   The men in the Toyota were both wearing seat belts, Goldenberg
said. "It's unknown whether it was the impact of the rear-ending or
the rollover that caused their injuries," he said. The driver of the
Mercedes was not cited, but the incident is under investigation,
Goldenberg said.</TE>

<HD>Family of Dead Inmate Seeks New Investigation</HD>
<DH>Jail: Widow, two children want prosecutors to reopen
criminal probe. Legal claim was settled for record sum last week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of an Orange County Jail inmate whose death in 1998
resulted in a record legal settlement called on local and state
prosecutors Monday to reopen a criminal probe into allegations that
the man was beaten to death by sheriff's deputies.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to local and state prosecutors, a lawyer for Gilbert
Garcia's widow and two children said there was little doubt that,
while the man was in jail, his civil rights were violated and the
force used by deputies caused his death.</LD>
<LD>   A district attorney's spokeswoman said the office, which initially
cleared the deputies of wrongdoing, is willing to review any new
evidence in the case.</LD>
<TE>   Garcia's family contended in a lawsuit that deputies beat the
inmate shortly after he entered jail on May 30, 1998. Coroner's
officials said Garcia suffered a fractured skull, three broken ribs
and cuts and bruises.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors on Wednesday voted 4 to 1 to settle the
legal claim for $650,000. The award was the county's largest in a
jail brutality case.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, sheriff's officials deny any wrongdoing and point to
a district attorney's investigation that concluded Garcia was injured
before he entered the jail.</TE>
<TE>   According to police reports, a Garden Grove officer who arrested
Garcia told a district attorney's investigator that Garcia had blood
on his hands and was holding his head as if in pain at the time of
the arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The officer speculated that Garcia hit his head while climbing
over a fence.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who voted against settling the case,
called the allegations against the jail deputies "outrageous." He
argued that the county might be legally liable only because jail
staff failed to notice Garcia's head injury.</TE>
<TE>   "He had already sustained a head injury prior to coming into our
jail," Spitzer said. "We are responsible for his medical care, and
there may have been a failure to triage him properly."</TE>

<HD>Dumping Off Huntington Is Up for Review</HD>
<DH>Utilities: Sanitation board will decide whether to seek an
extension on an EPA waiver that allows the discharge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Sanitation District's board of directors will meet
Wednesday to discuss whether it should continue dumping partly
treated sewage from an outfall four miles off the Huntington Beach
coast.</LD>
<LD>   The district has a waiver from the EPA that allows it to do less
treatment of sewage than most other districts in the country. The
waiver expires next year.</LD>
<LD>   Three of the four alternatives under consideration call for the
district to maintain the waiver; the fourth would have the district
give full secondary treatment to the sewage.</LD>
<TE>   Eight Orange County cities are opposed to an extension of the
waiver, fearing the partly treated sewage is polluting the ocean and
could be a cause of the high bacteria levels that have periodically
closed beaches the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   District officials said there is no evidence sewage from the
outfall is polluting the beaches. Ending the waiver, they said, would
force the district to spend $400 million for new sewage treatment
facilities. Some on the district's board have suggested a nonbinding
ballot measure that would seek the public's perspective on the
issues.</TE>
<TE>   A bill sponsored by Assemblyman Ken Maddox (R-Garden Grove) would
require that all waste water discharged into the ocean by the
district receive full treatment.</TE>
<TE>   That legislation cleared a key state Senate environmental
committee Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting begins at 6 p.m. in the district's Fountain Valley
headquarters, 10844 Ellis Ave.</TE>

<HD>Bombing Aboard Bus Kills 14 in Jerusalem</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A suicide bomber detonated a powerful blast that tore through an
Israeli bus packed with commuters and schoolchildren as it made its
way through rush-hour traffic here this morning, killing about 14
people and injuring more than 30, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The bombing came a day after Israeli police said they had "hot
warnings" of suicide bombers heading for Jerusalem and the northern
port city of Haifa, and a day after Israel assassinated a militant of
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement near
the West Bank city of Bethlehem.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said the bus exploded near the busy southern Jerusalem
Patt intersection shortly before 8 a.m. The explosion could be heard
throughout the southern end of the city.</LD>
<TE>   Jerusalem Police Chief Mickey Levy said he believed that the
bomber got on the bus in the Palestinian village of Beit Safafa,
inside the boundaries of southern Jerusalem, and blew himself up
seconds after boarding.</TE>
<TE>   "Yesterday we had a hot warning for Jerusalem, but it wasn't
focused," Levy told Israel Radio. He said he had flooded the streets
of the city with thousands of police officers and sent a helicopter
aloft to patrol in hopes of catching any would-be bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the past month and a half," Levy said, "we caught three
suicide bombers on their way to Jerusalem. But sometimes we fail to
intercept the attacker, like this morning, regrettably." Levy said
the city remains under warning of potential bombings in the days to
come.</TE>
<TE>   The force of this morning's explosion ripped the roof off the bus,
shattered its windows and melted part of its frame, said an Israel
Radio reporter at the scene. Ambulances and rescue vehicles converged
on the site and began carting the dead and wounded to hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very worried that our students were on the bus," said Rut
Elmaliah, a teacher at a high school near the intersection who said
she was driving to work when she saw the explosion. "I saw the bus
flying up in the air," said Elmaliah, who sobbed as she spoke to an
Israel Radio reporter at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very worried. This is an hour when the bus is always crowded"
with students heading for the school, she said. "I myself take it a
lot, but it just so happened that this was a day I had the car."</TE>
<TE>   The attack came as Israelis and Palestinians await this week's
unveiling of President Bush's vision for resolving their conflict.
The bombing is likely to intensify calls within the Israeli Cabinet
for a new large-scale military operation against the Palestinian
Authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   With Palestinian militants stepping up their attempts to attack
Israelis inside the pre-1967 borders in recent days, right-wing
Israeli Cabinet ministers have called on Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
to repeat the sweep through Palestinian-controlled areas that Israel
launched in March. That operation, triggered by a suicide attack on a
hotel where Israeli families were celebrating the Passover feast, was
Israel's largest military offensive in the West Bank since the Jewish
nation captured it from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   Troops arrested hundreds of Palestinians, blew up makeshift
weapons laboratories and trashed the offices of the Palestinian
Authority's ministries in Ramallah and other towns. Thousands of
Palestinians were placed under curfew for weeks at a time.</TE>
<TE>   But the Israeli security establishment said that although
Operation Defensive Shield, as it was called, decreased the
capabilities of militants to attack, it did not reduce their will to
strike at Israelis. Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Sunday
that it is now easier for militants to find willing suicide bombers
than it is to find the explosives to give them.</TE>
<TE>   Israel started building a fence Sunday running more or less along
the pre-1967 border in an effort to keep out suicide bombers. But the
fence is expected to take many months to complete. Avi Dichter, the
head of Israel's internal General Security Service, or Shin Bet, has
repeatedly urged the government to reoccupy Palestinian towns and
villages until the fence is completed.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has so far resisted that advice, but he will be under
enormous pressure to take harsh military action in response to
today's attack.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Radio reported that at least four more suicide bombers are
believed to have been "launched" from the West Bank, among them two
Palestinian women, who intend to carry out attacks inside Israel in
coming days. Police have erected roadblocks and are searching cars
and people in several major cities.</TE>

<HD>A Tale of Two Royal Gravesites</HD>
<DH>Russia: The Orthodox Church memorial to the last czar and
his slain family pits faith against the DNA credentials of another
location.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YEKATERINBURG, Russia</DL>
<LD>Fanciful log churches sprout like mushrooms in the deep woods outside
this industrial city. Anatoly Kozhayev shuffles between them, his
bushy gray hair and beard giving him a more than passing resemblance
to a troll.</LD>
<LD>   The pilgrim and tour guide surveys the churches' curvy green roofs
and shiny copper domes and sighs with satisfaction. "Isn't this a
fairy tale?" he asks.</LD>
<LD>   Just three years ago, this wood held little more than mosquitoes
and secrets. Here, in two abandoned mine shafts, Bolshevik gunmen
first buried the remains of the murdered Romanov royal
family--Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, his wife, five children and
four companions.</LD>
<TE>   The Russian Orthodox Church has canonized the Romanovs and is
building a monastery in the woods to commemorate their burial. Seven
churches are planned to honor the seven royal victims; five of the
structures are already built. The largest of them, St. Nicholas, has
17 onion domes, in honor of July 17, the day the royals died.</TE>
<TE>   But some visitors, especially those with a secular bent, might be
confused by a second Romanov burial memorial just a mile or so away
at a spot known as Porosyonkov Log. The second site, alongside a
railway track and marked by a modest black cross, has a marble plaque
declaring that the czar and his family were buried there.</TE>
<TE>   The competing burial sites demonstrate that when it comes to the
executed Romanovs, secular politics and religious politics have yet
to make their peace.</TE>
<TE>   For those who put their faith in science, there is little doubt
that the skeletons pulled from a watery hole at Porosyonkov Log are
those of the Romanovs. DNA from the skeletons, tested by several
Western laboratories with a reliability higher than 99%, was linked
to the Russian royal family.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the site and condition of the remains were consistent
with descriptions written by the royal family's killers. They said
they took the bodies and put them in a mine shaft in a place called
Ganina Yama but exhumed them the next day for fear locals would find
the spot. They found a more obscure site, Porosyonkov Log, burned two
of the corpses to ash and buried the rest.</TE>
<TE>   The remains were discovered there by amateur sleuths in 1979 and
exhumed in 1991. The Russian government buried them in the royal
crypt in St. Petersburg in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, the Russian Orthodox Church's position on the
bones remains unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   "They still don't accept the results of our investigation and
prefer to wait for some new evidence to materialize," says Vladimir
N. Solovyov, the senior prosecutor who headed the government
investigation. "But frankly, I don't see what else can emerge in the
case which would make them change their decision."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the enormous woodland Monastery of the Royal Passion
Sufferers is being built on the basis of a far earlier probe--that of
Nikolai Sokolov, a pro-monarchist investigator, who discovered Ganina
Yama after anti-Bolshevik troops took the area in 1918. Sokolov
concluded that the bodies had been all but destroyed at the site and
if there were any remaining ash and bones, they were tossed into the
mine shafts or scattered in the woods.</TE>
<TE>   Consistent with the Sokolov conclusion, the centerpieces of the
new monastery are the mine shafts--now just grassy
depressions--encircled by a roofed viewing platform. Pilgrims kneel
at crosses placed randomly through the woods, because, according to
this version of events, the royal family's remains may be anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the church has a perfect right to build a monastery at
this location commemorating the death of the czar's family, because
the earth there was also stained with the royal family's blood,"
Solovyov says.</TE>
<TE>   Kozhayev and other believers are little bothered by the DNA
evidence suggesting that the Romanov remains were buried elsewhere.
He finds faith far more persuasive.</TE>
<TE>   Standing near the shafts, the tour guide points to a tall, thick
birch and a lithe pine tree growing near the holes. "Those are the
czar and czarina," he says. Then he points to an immature birch and a
small stand of four birches on the opposite side. "The czarevitch and
the four daughters," he says. "The landscape itself testifies that
this is a holy place."</TE>
<TE>   Believers such as Kozhayev have been very influential in the
debate over the czarist remains. Sometimes swayed by nationalist or
chauvinistic ideologies, they were suspicious of any investigation
that they believed was tainted by Communist-era evidence.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Kozhayev offers the following explanation for the
second burial site: "The czar had a double. So did the whole family,
for security. Even the bodyguards didn't know which was the right
one. To get money from the West, [the government] had to find the
czar's remains. So they said the doubles were the real ones."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the prevalence of such views at Ganina Yama, the opinions
of many in the church appear to be softening, says Sergei Chapnin,
editor of Moskovsky Tserkovny Vestnik, an official church
publication.</TE>
<TE>   "With time, it is becoming more evident that the government
investigation was conscientious and that the protests against it were
based more on politics and ideology and were largely without merit,"
Chapnin says.</TE>
<TE>   The official church position, he says, is that only time will tell
whether the exhumed bones are authentic royal remains.</TE>
<TE>   "The church already has a significant number of people who
consider the remains authentic, who believe the conclusion of the
government commission and consider the bones buried in St. Petersburg
to be holy relics," Chapnin says. "It's fully possible that we could
return to this discussion in the future, perhaps even in the near
future."</TE>
<TE>   Sergei L. Loiko of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to this
report.</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A blast tore through a bus here during morning rush hour today,
killing 10 people and wounding at least 29, police and radio reports
said.</LD>
<LD>   Jerusalem Police Chief Mickey Levy and radio reports said the
force of the blast ripped the bus apart at a crowded intersection.</LD>
<LD>   Police had been on high alert since Monday, after receiving
warnings that a suicide bomber was trying to carry out an attack in
Jerusalem.</LD>
<TE>   Today's violence came after witnesses and the Israeli military
said soldiers shot and killed a prominent figure in a Palestinian
militia in the Bethlehem area Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians said Walid Sbeh was killed in his car in El Khader,
near Bethlehem, as he was leaving the village.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers opened fire from an army base on a nearby hill, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sbeh was an activist in the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia
affiliated with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah
movement, which has claimed responsibility for several attacks on
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military sources confirmed that Sbeh had been targeted and
shot. The sources said Sbeh was responsible for sending Palestinian
suicide bombers into Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Three would-be bombers had implicated Sbeh, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, a Palestinian blew himself up in Israeli territory
near the West Bank, killing only himself, and Israeli forces
continued their pursuit of militants in Palestinian villages.</TE>

<HD>Karzai Alerts Afghans That He Will Select New Cabinet</HD>
<DH>Politics: President-to-be also parries delegates by
proposing a panel to discuss a legislature.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Confronted by demands from this nation's grand assembly for a voice
in deciding who will run the next government, incoming President
Hamid Karzai put the delegates on notice Monday that he will make the
appointments and at best let them know his selections before their
session disperses.</LD>
<LD>   Karzai also responded to the gathering's conflicting proposals for
formation of a legislature with a tried-and-true delaying tactic: He
proposed a committee.</LD>
<LD>   The announcements made by the newly chosen transitional president
on the seventh day of the prolonged assembly, or loya jirga,
confirmed the impression that had been forming among delegates for
days that further decisions about the country's governance will be up
to Karzai, not the gathering.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the curtailing of the loya jirga's clout in charting
Afghanistan's postwar future, there were mixed sentiments among the
delegates about the value of their volatile convocation.</TE>
<TE>   Some were angry that they had been allowed to do little more than
rubber-stamp the interim government's plans for running the country
until nationwide elections in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Others hailed the forum that democratically chose a leader and
brought together fierce warlords, humble farmers, intellectuals and
refugees for peaceful debate and a search for national solutions.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is talking over the same things and nothing important,"
said Abdul Qader Khan, an ethnic Pushtun delegate from the southern
city of Kandahar. "It's really frustrating--and boring."</TE>
<TE>   But others urged their colleagues in the nearly 1,600-strong
gathering to keep its shortcomings in context.</TE>
<TE>   "We never expected it to be so successful," said former President
Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, praising the first loya jirga in a generation
for selecting Karzai as transitional president and airing the
concerns and grievances of constituents.</TE>
<TE>   After 23 years of bloodshed, as well as persistent violence on the
country's lawless fringes, the lively exchanges in an air-conditioned
tent erected on a soccer field provided an alternative for settling
Afghanistan's differences, said Ahmed Wali Masoud, Afghanistan's
ambassador to Britain and brother of slain Northern Alliance warrior
Ahmed Shah Masoud.</TE>
<TE>   The loya jirga, a 1,000-year-old tradition for deciding vital
national issues, was supposed to conclude Sunday after selecting a
head of state, deciding the structure of a transitional government
and approving "key positions" within the leadership. The agenda was
outlined in a U.N.-brokered agreement signed last fall by Afghan
leaders who met in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   But except for the selection Thursday of Karzai, a 44-year-old
Pushtun who has been interim prime minister for six months, the
delegates have been mired in conflict and complaints about their
role. Like many Afghans, the participants want to see a reduction of
the power of Northern Alliance commanders who have controlled the
interim government seated at the talks in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's aides have been saying for days that it is impractical to
submit personnel decisions for the perusal of nearly 1,600 people and
that the need for a Cabinet of professionals has to outweigh even the
desire for strict ethnic balance. The current ministers of foreign
affairs, the interior and defense are all ethnic Tajik warlords, as
is the head of the intelligence service.</TE>
<TE>   The new Cabinet must be named by Saturday, when the interim
government's mandate expires. But Karzai told the delegates that his
slate of appointees might not be ready before the assembly ends its
deliberations. He promised to seat an ethnically representative
government and one with the skills needed to lift the country out of
poverty and desolation.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Monday how much longer the loya jirga will remain
in session, although Foreign Minister Abdullah said the aim was to
wrap up today or Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Delegate Fatima Gailani, a Western-educated Pushtun who has lived
in Britain for years, expressed the mix of trust and suspicion felt
by many at the loya jirga. "Everybody loves Mr. Karzai," she said.
"But there is such fear about who will be in his Cabinet."</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's authority has largely been limited to Kabul, the capital,
but the relative peace that has reigned since his December
appointment as premier is seen as the result of a power-sharing deal
with the Northern Alliance commanders. If they are dropped from the
government, factional fighting could resume and central authority
collapse. Hoping to ease delegates' qualms about the incoming
Cabinet, Karzai urged them to pick representatives to stay in Kabul
as a committee after the loya jirga ends to advise him and discuss
how to seat a fair and representative consultative council, or shura.</TE>

<HD>World Cup Dreams Run Dry in Mexico</HD>
<DH>Soccer: After team's 2-0 defeat by Americans, the capital
is largely silent as residents mourn yet another loss to their
superpower neighbor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX and CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Fernando de Victoria strutted among 500 anxious fans jammed into
Yarda's sports bar in the wee hours of Monday, doubling as waiter and
cheerleader for Mexico's soccer team. The United States was up 1-0,
and it was his job to blow a referee's whistle every few minutes to
shatter the gloom.</LD>
<LD>   But for long stretches of the World Cup match televised from South
Korea, the whistle was the loudest sound in the bar, and after Mexico
fell behind 2-0, the waiter despaired and put it away.</LD>
<LD>   That's the way Mexico's promising start in the 32-nation
tournament ended: goal-less and in silence.</LD>
<TE>   The joyous postgame mini-riots here that accompanied the team's
triumphant march through the first round did not recur after Monday's
knockout loss. There were no fireworks, no looting, no injuries, no
mass arrests.</TE>
<TE>   There was only a humiliating fact: The powerful neighbor that
historically has dominated the Mexicans in so many ways--militarily,
economically and in every major sport but soccer--had whipped them at
their national pastime.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a return to reality, to frustration--our only true national
sentiment," said Jesus Orduna, a sociologist in the southern state of
Chiapas.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers that had delayed their press runs by several hours for
the game etched the defeat in bold headlines. "An American
Nightmare," said the sports tabloid Esto. "The Dream Ended," declared
La Cronica de Hoy.</TE>
<TE>   "There is silence everywhere," said Maria Rosa Nieto, an actuary
in the Mexican capital's financial district. "People don't want to
talk."</TE>
<TE>   The funk hit Edna Espinoza, who sells cardboard boxes to
factories. "You notice it," she said. "There is less energy, no
flags, no horns honking."</TE>
<TE>   Arturo Garcia, a financial analyst at Colgate Palmolive consumer
products here, said employees were less productive than usual, less
friendly, more irritable. "A lot of people didn't even come to work,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the hangover of defeat, Mexicans faulted the team's sub-par
play and an apparent American foul that the referee had missed. But
mostly they faulted themselves for succumbing to delusions.</TE>
<TE>   A surprising 92% of those polled by a television network here had
predicted that their team would win Monday, even though Mexico had
lost four of its previous five matches to the steadily improving
Americans. Some fans had already made plans for watching Friday
quarterfinals against Germany, convinced that Mexico--not the United
States--would advance to that match.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexicans have a right to dream, at least in soccer, because we
cannot dream about real life," Joaquin Lopez Doriga, a news anchor
for Radio Formula, told his audience Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We let ourselves dream, we pursued our dream together, and now
let's go together in disappointment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   President Vicente Fox gave his team and his country a televised
pep talk after staying up with his Cabinet to watch the match.</TE>
<TE>   "In no way do we feel defeated," Fox said. "The important thing is
to fight, fight, fight with tenacity.... Better times will come. They
will come."</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to defuse nationalist tensions over the match, Fox and
President Bush spoke by phone from their ranches Sunday to wish each
other's team well.</TE>
<TE>   But many Mexicans viewed the match as nothing less than the latest
battle in a long struggle against America's superpower domination.</TE>
<TE>   "We got carried away by thinking of this match as revenge for the
way the Americans mistreat our immigrants and fight over our water,"
said Hector Garcia Mendoza, a Mexico City taxi driver struggling to
stay awake after being up all night. "It's not just that we lost," he
added. "It's whom we lost to."</TE>
<TE>   At Yuppie's in Mexico City's Zona Rosa, one of thousands of
Mexican bars that were packed for the match, many viewers shouted
obscenities when "The Star-Spangled Banner" was played.</TE>
<TE>   Screams of anger greeted Brian McBride's goal for the United
States eight minutes into the match. After a few seconds of
depression, the crowd began chanting, "Mexico! Mexico!"</TE>
<TE>   But Landon Donovan's goal late in the game brought a hush. Men
wept and pulled green Team Mexico jerseys over their faces.</TE>
<TE>   At the capital's Angel of Independence monument, where tens of
thousands rallied after Mexico's first round successes, only about
300 bothered to show up Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Some tried to extract political capital out of wounded national
pride.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we don't owe water! Now we don't owe water!" they chanted on
TV, urging the government to default on its 480-billion-gallon debt
to Texas reservoirs along the Rio Grande.</TE>
<TE>   Many Mexicans stumbling to work Monday said that they felt no
hostility toward the United States and that the game was just a game.
Even so, they said, it was more painful to lose to the Americans than
to anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you really think your team is better than Italy?" Marco
Rivera, a 22-year-old restaurant worker, asked an American. "We tied
Italy, nearly beat them, and Italy has won the World Cup three times.
And then you beat us. Soccer is our sport, not yours. How can that
happen?"</TE>

<HD>Rebels Shoot at U.S. Troops in Philippines</HD>
<DH>Military: Marines and local soldiers return fire, killing a
number of guerrillas, the Pentagon says. Americans suffer no
casualties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. troops came under fire from rebels in the Philippines on Monday
for the first time since beginning a training exercise in February,
the Pentagon said.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Marines and Philippine soldiers returned fire, killing at
least some of the guerrillas, and suffered no casualties themselves.
The incident marked the first direct U.S. confrontation with the
rebels plaguing the Philippines.</LD>
<LD>   The clash came as President Bush neared a decision on a
recommendation by top military officers to intensify operations in
the Southeast Asian nation.</LD>
<TE>   At issue is the U.S. role in a combat zone in the southern
Philippines, where Abu Sayyaf guerrillas who have been linked to the
Al Qaeda terrorism network are trying to carve out a Muslim nation.
Senior American defense officials were to meet with Bush this week to
discuss the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on Monday declined to detail
his recommendation to Bush, but a broad array of military officials
have called for a longer and more intense mission. A senior defense
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the officers
include U.S. commanders in the Philippines; the regional commander in
the Pacific, Adm. Thomas Fargo; and Air Force Gen. Richard B. Myers,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</TE>
<TE>   In a Pentagon briefing, Rumsfeld said the decision has "jelled"
and would probably be "sorted out in the next few days" both within
the Bush administration and the Philippine government.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans joined in the firefight after gunmen shot at a group
that included two Marines and a number of Philippine soldiers who
were guarding U.S. Navy Seabees working on roads and bridges on
impoverished Basilan island, said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Davis, a
Pentagon spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said at least some of the fighters who fired on the party
were killed at a work site 10 miles southeast of the town of Isabela.</TE>
<TE>   Fargo and his commanders in the Philippines have urged the Bush
administration to transform the training exercise into a combat
mission, allowing U.S. advisors to join directly in the search for
Abu Sayyaf rebels and to stay beyond July, when the exercise is due
to end.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz visited American forces
in the Philippines last month and has since filed a report. His
recommendation is not known.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal favored by commanders, the July deadline would
be extended and U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers, or Green Berets,
who now can train only brigade-sized groups of hundreds of soldiers,
would be allowed to instruct companies of fewer than 100 troops and
join them on patrols, the senior defense official said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. interest in the guerrilla war was heightened May 27, 2001,
when Abu Sayyaf rebels kidnapped American missionaries Martin and
Gracia Burnham. In the wake of Sept. 11, after reports that some of
the rebels had joined Al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan, the
Philippines became the first non-Afghan focus of U.S. troops in a
global war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But the rules of engagement for the exercise prohibit U.S. forces
from joining directly in the fight against the rebels, limiting them
to training efforts. U.S. commanders in the Philippines said they
helped craft but took no direct part in the June 7 mission in which
Martin Burnham and Philippine hostage Deborah Yap were killed and
Gracia Burnham was rescued.</TE>
<TE>   Heightened U.S. involvement would probably intensify domestic
opposition to Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in a
nation where the constitution forbids combat operations by foreign
military personnel except in a state of emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Many American officials contend that keeping U.S. forces in
Southeast Asia is key to reducing a breeding ground for potential
Muslim terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 1,000 American troops in the Philippines. They
include Green Berets training Filipinos on Basilan island, and
Marines and Navy Seabees.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Rumsfeld said Monday that the destruction of Al Qaeda's
safe haven in Afghanistan has led the group to focus on new
operations and to join with like-minded organizations in other
countries. Some officials cite a bombing last week that killed 12
Pakistanis outside the U.S. Consulate in Karachi as a possible
example, although it remains unclear who caused the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep doing things that disrupt their ability to engage in
terrorist acts, but unquestionably, we're not going to disrupt them
all," Rumsfeld said. "There's no way to do that. Life's not perfect."</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, Myers said, a stash of 30 surface-to-air missiles
recovered in recent days by U.S. soldiers near the Pakistani border
included HN-5 models made in China. American- and Russian-made
missiles also were known to be widely available in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The stash was among as many as 10 separate caches of weapons,
including hundreds of rockets, mortar launchers and other equipment,
discovered over the past two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld also said Pakistan has shifted more troops to its border
with Afghanistan, site of repeated incursions by Al Qaeda operatives,
as tensions have eased with India.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LIMA, Peru</DL>
<LD>Police deployed armored vehicles and squads armed with automatic
rifles in the capital Monday to prevent the spread of unrest tied to
last week's sale of state-run companies.</LD>
<LD>   While the armored vehicles patrolled the Pan American Highway,
armed police mounted the road's pedestrian bridges.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile Monday, protests over the privatizations spread to
Tacna, about 600 miles southeast of Lima, said city security official
Hector Garcia.</LD>
<TE>   Rioters broke windows at a branch office of Telefonica, the
Spanish firm that bought Peru's state telephone company in 1994,
Garcia said. They smashed public telephone booths and blocked the Pan
American Highway leading into Chile.</TE>
<TE>   Protests began Friday in Arequipa--Peru's second-largest city,
about 130 miles northwest of Tacna and 465 miles southeast of
Lima--after officials in the capital auctioned two electricity
companies based in the Arequipa and Tacna regions to a Belgian firm.</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrators fear that privatization will lead to job cuts and
electricity rate hikes.</TE>
<TE>   Peru's government Sunday declared Arequipa and the surrounding
region to be in a 30-day state of emergency under military rule.</TE>

<HD>White House Struggles to Forge Mideast Plan</HD>
<DH>Policy: Bush is expected to propose an interim Palestinian
state this week. But among his advisors, rifts remain over how
specific to be.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush huddled with his foreign policy team
Monday in an attempt to build consensus among his advisors as he
prepares to unveil a plan for breaking the deadlock in the Middle
East peace process, according to U.S. officials and diplomats from
the region.</LD>
<LD>   Significant differences within the administration were not settled
during intense weekend meetings, and Bush is now personally involved
in sorting through the options. "They're still building consensus on
the best approach," said an administration official who asked to
remain anonymous.</LD>
<LD>   This week, Bush is expected to announce a proposal to create an
interim Palestinian state, a plan aimed at promoting rapid political
reforms by Palestinian leaders and at undercutting extremists.</LD>
<TE>   The White House hopes such developments would both reassure Israel
and marginalize Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   But well-placed sources said there are major differences within
the administration over whether Bush should outline a timeline for
the creation of a permanent state; over the final borders of the new
entity; and over how to proceed through the interim phase.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the fundamental dilemma is just how specific to be. "The
vaguer Bush is, the harder the proposal will be to sell. And the more
specific he is, the harder it will be to get agreement from either
side," said Martin Indyk, a former ambassador to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest threat," he said, "is that the president will
announce something that is then denounced by both sides and is
therefore dead on arrival."</TE>
<TE>   The State Department has been pushing for specificity on borders
and some form of a timeline for a permanent state. But Vice President
Dick Cheney's office and the Pentagon have argued that performance by
the Palestinians should determine progress toward such a state.
Unlike in past administrations, the Pentagon has played a more direct
role in the current debate.</TE>
<TE>   At the last minute, Arafat's administration put forward its own
proposal over the weekend in a meeting between Planning Minister
Nabil Shaath and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, according to
U.S. and Palestinian officials. Shaath proposed a plan for a
permanent state that would involve one year of negotiation and one
year of implementation.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab world, led by Saudi Arabia and Egypt, has proposed a
timeline of two to three years, with a permanent state by early 2005.
In contrast, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon wants no timeline.
He argues that the Palestinians should meet strict security and
political conditions before any type of statehood is considered.</TE>
<TE>   The behind-the-scenes debate in Washington comes as a major tiff
brews between the United States and the Palestinians over criticism
of Arafat by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview with the San Jose Mercury News, Rice charged
that Arafat's government is "corrupt and cavorts with terror" and "is
not the basis for a Palestinian state moving forward."</TE>
<TE>   Rice said the administration does not look at the new U.S.
approach as a bid to reform the Palestinian Authority but as
"building the institutions of a state that will be capable of
actually moving to statehood."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat shot back Monday that how reform should be implemented and
by whom are "purely a Palestinian matter."</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian Authority will act according to its people's
interests and will not receive orders from anyone," he told reporters
as he toured a high school in the West Bank city of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Political tensions are rising in the region in anticipation of
Bush's announcement, with opposition already forming on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat will not readily go along with an interim state proposal,
according to U.S. and Middle East sources.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians insisted Monday that the only way to break the
deadlock with Israel is to move to talks on a final settlement
immediately, including a deadline for Israel's withdrawal from
territories occupied during the 1967 Middle East War and the
dismantling of all Jewish settlements in those areas, which include
the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to beat Arafat at a game he's been playing for 40
years," said a Middle Eastern diplomat in Washington who asked for
anonymity. "It's like playing a one-on-one with Shaquille O'Neal.
It'll be hard to marginalize Arafat on his own court."</TE>
<TE>   There also is concern among Israelis about Bush's announcement.</TE>
<TE>   The only senior Israeli official to indicate support for the
interim-state concept has been dovish Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in Bulgaria on Monday, Peres said that the state Bush is
expected to propose would function as a true nation but with
undefined borders.</TE>
<TE>   "We call it a provisional state, but only the borders are
provisional, nothing else," Peres said. He said he had reached an
understanding with Palestinian officials for a state to begin
functioning "within eight weeks."</TE>
<TE>   But Peres conceded that the Israeli government had neither
accepted nor rejected that plan.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Television quoted unidentified senior Israeli sources
Monday night as saying that there is virtually no support in the
Sharon Cabinet for an interim Palestine.</TE>
<TE>   Disputes already have erupted within Sharon's broad-based
government over construction of a fence roughly along a portion of
the pre-1967 border between Israel and the West Bank. Work on the
fence officially began Sunday, after months of debate.</TE>
<TE>   Right-wing Cabinet members protested that the concrete walls and
electronic barricades eventually will become the political boundaries
of the Palestinian state. Left-wing and centrist members say the
barricades are needed to protect Israelis from suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   A call from Bush to establish a Palestinian state in the West Bank
is sure to further exacerbate tensions within the fractious body.</TE>
<TE>   Wright reported from Washington and Curtius from Jerusalem.</TE>

<HD>Enron Paid Senior Execs Millions</HD>
<DH>Compensation: Court filing shows 140 key employees got an
average of $5.3 million last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Before collapsing last year, Enron Corp. paid out $744 million in
salary, bonus and stock grants to the company's 140 senior
officers--an average of $5.3 million each.</LD>
<LD>   The company disclosed the payments Monday in a court filing that
provided the most detailed accounting yet of the company's payments
to executives and other employees--including $100 million in
retention bonuses to about 300 workers.</LD>
<LD>   The filing also details $3.6 billion in payments to creditors and
others in the three months before Enron filed for bankruptcy
protection Dec. 2.</LD>
<TE>   The sums collected by top Enron insiders provide a stark contrast
with the modest severance payments to the 4,200 Enron employees who
lost their jobs around the time of the bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the most any of the fired workers has collected is well
under $10,000, Lowell Peterson, a lawyer for a number of those
workers, said Monday. In a recent settlement still awaiting court
approval, the group won several additional payments up to a maximum
of $13,500 per person, he said.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay collected
$103.6 million in total payments last year, including salary of $1.07
million, a bonus of $7 million, long-term incentives of $3.6 million
and $81.5 million in loan advances, according to the filing. Lay also
was awarded stock options and restricted stock worth $49.1 million,
the documents show.</TE>
<TE>   "It sort of shocks the conscience," Peterson said. "It's just not
right for a company to be run as a private piggy bank for its
officers, who then proceed to run it into the ground, costing 4,200
people their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Employees and investors who lost money in Enron's collapse could
seek to have the bonuses rescinded and used toward a potential damage
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Finance Committee said Monday it was investigating
whether the bonuses were paid into special accounts, possibly
offshore, without the knowledge of tax authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The salary data are part of a required 1,600-page "statement of
financial affairs."</TE>
<TE>   The salary and bonus figures are for all officers at the level of
managing director and above. The data go beyond what already has been
disclosed in Enron's regular proxy statements, which deal with a few
top executives and directors, including Lay, former President and
Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling and former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew S. Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the information disclosed Monday concerns the nearly
$3.6 billion in payments made by Enron to its creditors before its
bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Those creditors include Enron's former accounting firm, Arthur
Andersen, which collected $12.3 million over the three months, the
filing shows. A federal jury in Houston on Saturday convicted
Andersen of obstruction of justice for its role in the Enron scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Other large creditors include big commercial and investment banks
such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Lehman Bros., Credit Suisse First Boston,
Citibank, Bank of New York and UBS Warburg. Most of the bank
transactions involved foreign-currency exchanges connected with
Enron's overseas operations, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   The documents give a flavor--much of it ironic in light of Enron's
collapse--of the minutiae of daily corporate life. Payments went for
such expenses as soft drinks, burritos, limousines, party tents and
silk flowers. But there also was $37,933.70 to Accountemps, $100,000
each to the Republican and Democratic senatorial committees and
$90,000 to the lobbying group Americans for Tax Reform.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's filing concerns just Enron Corp., the parent corporation,
Palmer noted. Filings by more than 50 other Enron entities are still
to come, he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the documents, here is what some key Enron executives
collected last year:</TE>
<TE>   * Skilling received $8.7 million in salary, bonus and other
compensation last year, plus stock and options grants of $26 million.
A spokeswoman for Skilling could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   * Fastow in 2001 collected $2.4 million in salary, bonus and other
pay, plus $1.8 million in stock-related compensation. The figures do
not include the reported $40 million more that he received through
his interest in controversial limited partnerships that Enron used to
boost profits and conceal corporate debt.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the papers were filed; we don't have a comment on any
aspect of it," said Gordon Andrew, a spokesman for Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   * Richard B. Buy, former chief risk officer, received $2.4 million
in salary and bonus and $3.4 million in stock compensation.</TE>
<TE>   * Richard A. Causey, former chief accounting officer, was paid
$1.9 million in salary and bonus plus $2.5 million in stock awards.</TE>
<TE>   Buy and Causey were criticized in a board report Feb. 1 that said
they were not effectively policing off-the-books partnerships run by
Fastow and others. Both were subsequently fired.</TE>
<TE>   J.C. Nickens, a Houston lawyer who represents Buy, Causey and
several other former Enron executives, said Monday that Buy and
Causey put far less money into their pockets than the numbers show
because they had to pay taxes on stock-related compensation that
became worthless after the bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Causey, for example, lost all but $400,000 of his stock-related
payments but had to pay taxes totaling $1.6 million last year, the
lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not out there looking for sympathy, just a fair hearing,"
Nickens said.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Kimberly, a spokesman for Lay, said the figures "appear to
grossly overstate the amount of compensation which Mr. Lay realized
in the 12 months prior to the bankruptcy filing."</TE>
<TE>   Much of his pay was in stock, stock options and other long-term
compensation that, because of the bankruptcy, was never realized, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mulligan reported from New York and Rivera from Los Angeles.
Reuters was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Energy Monitor Failed to Do Job</HD>
<DH>Power: Congressional watchdog finds that FERC lacked
expertise and clout to ensure fair electricity prices during the
California crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Federal energy regulators failed to set up measures to
protect consumers when they approved California's deregulation scheme
and are still outgunned by energy traders a year after the energy
crisis that hobbled the state, according to the findings of a
congressional investigation to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   The report by the nonpartisan General Accounting Office said the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission still lacks the expertise and
clout to protect consumers from price gouging and other maneuvers,
despite "hopeful" changes under its new chairman.</LD>
<LD>   "FERC is not adequately performing the oversight that is needed to
ensure that the prices produced by these markets are just and
reasonable, and therefore, it is not fulfilling its regulatory
mandate," said the GAO report, a copy of which was obtained by The
Times.</LD>
<TE>   The report, the strongest and most detailed criticism of federal
energy regulators to date by the GAO, prompted a concession by FERC
Chairman Patrick H. Wood III that the agency had fallen down on the
job during the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "The commission had not previously focused its efforts clearly
enough to succeed," Wood wrote the GAO in response. "That has now
changed."</TE>
<TE>   Wood is setting up a new oversight and investigations office while
aggressively pursuing a probe of alleged market manipulation in
California and the West. The investigation was given new momentum by
the disclosure last month of internal Enron Corp. memos indicating
that its traders used various ploys to manipulate the California
energy market.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the Governmental
Affairs Committee, said he would ask the GAO to monitor the new
energy investigations office to ensure that Wood lives up to his
promise.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are to restore consumers' and investors' badly shaken
confidence in our energy markets ... we will first have to restore
confidence in the regulatory system," Lieberman said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   FERC's fitful regulatory efforts have been undermined by
insufficient expertise with competitive electricity markets, a
continually changing agency leadership and the lack of legal
authority to impose penalties that "bite" companies that engage in
market manipulation, the GAO report found.</TE>
<TE>   FERC, which functions like a national utilities commission, is
charged with ensuring "just and reasonable" rates in wholesale
electricity markets. It was heavily criticized by public officials as
remaining aloof while California's energy crisis escalated during
late 2000 and early 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure, the agency imposed price limits throughout the
West last summer, an act credited with belatedly calming the markets.
FERC is considering California's petition for $9 billion in refunds
for alleged overcharges and for revising long-term power contracts
negotiated during the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators found that FERC was adept at monitoring electric
utilities in the previous era of government-regulated prices but that
it never made the transition to being a watchdog in the freewheeling
world of unregulated markets. Nonetheless, FERC gave its approval to
the deregulation plans of California and other states. The agency's
regulatory weaknesses meant that the states would be on their own if
they got into trouble, as California soon found out.</TE>
<TE>   In a revealing survey, 37% of FERC enforcement staffers told GAO
investigators that their agency was ineffective in detecting
monopolistic abuses in wholesale electricity markets.</TE>
<TE>   Among enforcement staffers, 33% said the agency did a poor job of
analyzing market data to determine if prices are inflated, compared
with 28% who said FERC performed adequately. Thirty-nine percent said
the agency's top management had failed to give clear and concise
directions. The agency has had four chairmen in the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly three-fourths of the staff told the GAO that FERC's
previous major effort to reinvent itself--a 1997 reorganization
called "FERC First"--had been of little or no help in making it a
better watchdog. "While many employees told us that overall, FERC
First was a failure, several stated that it was a disaster," the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO investigation, requested by Sen. Jean Carnahan (D-Mo.),
found that previous efforts by the agency to improve as a watchdog
had failed to produce results. "Most of these actions have been
incomplete or limited in their effectiveness," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, for example, then-FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr.
announced the opening of a high-tech "market observation resource
room." Staffers equipped with speedy computers and sophisticated
hardware would track energy markets around the country, ready to
react to the first sign of an unexplained price spike.</TE>
<TE>   But FERC has never subscribed to information services that would
allow it to obtain the names and other details about parties trading
in a large slice of the markets, the GAO found. The result is like a
window on the markets with the blinds half-lowered. Its main use is
not as an enforcement tool but to educate staffers about how energy
trading works, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "FERC has not yet been able to use the [market observation] room
to its full regulatory and oversight potential," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Although FERC is the principal federal agency overseeing
electricity and natural gas markets, the GAO found that 75-year-old
federal laws give the agency insufficient penalties to pose a
credible deterrent against market abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "No section of [federal law] allows FERC to levy monetary
penalties against market participants who charge unjust or
unreasonable rates for electricity," the report said. "Without a
meaningful range of penalties, FERC lacks adequate enforcement 'bite'
to deter anticompetitive behavior or other violations."</TE>
<TE>   The agency has authority to order limited refunds and to revoke a
company's trading rights.</TE>
<TE>   It may take several years for FERC to become a better watchdog,
investigators cautioned. In the meantime, state and regional
regulators will be the main line of defense protecting consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "Absent an effective regulatory and oversight approach," the
report concluded, "FERC lacks assurance that today's energy markets
are producing interstate wholesale natural gas and electricity prices
that are just and reasonable."</TE>

<LD>The U.S. soccer team upset Mexico with a 2-0 victory, but the most
stunning "gooooooaaaaaaal" of this World Cup may belong to television
networks, sports marketers and Major League Soccer.</LD>
<LD>   Across Southern California, groggy fans stumbled into work Monday
after staying up well past 1 a.m. to watch the game broadcast from
South Korea. Preliminary ratings show it was the most watched soccer
match ever for Los Angeles Spanish-language channel KMEX-TV.</LD>
<LD>   National ratings from the U.S.-Mexico game won't be released until
today. But those numbers are expected to easily top the 1 million
viewers nationwide on average who have been watching the games while
most people sleep. Some see the growing viewership as a sign that
soccer is finally cutting across traditional cultural lines and
coming of age in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   "It's more than just crazy soccer fans. The numbers are too big
for that," said Mark Quenzel, senior vice president for programming
for ESPN, which is broadcasting the game for English-speaking
audiences. "The ratings have far exceeded anything that we could have
hoped for."</TE>
<TE>   George Locke, a lifelong soccer fan, watches the 11:30 p.m. game,
tunes in to Spanish-language highlights of the match he has just seen
and then sets his alarm for the next game at dawn.</TE>
<TE>   "All my friends, we're on the phone at 4 in the morning," said
Locke, a 37-year-old Hollywood prop man who ends up napping during
the day. "I'm talking to people in Texas and all through Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Max Mosher, and their 3-year-old son, Finn, are awake
too, but not by choice. "If somebody scores a goal and I get excited,
I'll yell and then I'll hear Finn crying and Max yelling to be
quiet," Locke said. "I can't control myself."</TE>
<TE>   Soccer still is dwarfed by powerhouse U.S. sports. ABC's "Monday
Night Football," for example, last season drew an average 4.9 million
viewers a week. But media executives say soccer is showing growth
among broader audiences. The World Cup is drawing nearly as many U.S.
viewers to its English-language broadcasts as to those in Spanish,
according to Nielsen Media Research figures through Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, networks and advertisers cautiously embraced
soccer despite widespread indifference in the U.S. They had little
choice. If interest in U.S. soccer ever neared the interest it enjoys
worldwide, they reasoned, they'd be left behind.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Univision, which owns KMEX-TV Channel 34, paid $150
million for U.S. Spanish-language broadcasting rights for the 2002
and 2006 games, even though it warned investors it expected to lose
money on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to define their franchise as being the go-to
broadcaster for the World Cup, just as NBC is the go-to broadcaster
for the Olympics," said media analyst David W. Miller.</TE>
<TE>   The sport also took a chance on itself.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN risked little on its deal. The sports network has a long-term
relationship with Major League Soccer, which purchased the
English-language U.S. broadcasting rights for about $50 million from
a German media company that acquired them from soccer's governing
body.</TE>
<TE>   The league handled advertising itself for the games broadcast on
ESPN. The sales pitch was easy: Introduce your product to a new
international audience overseas, the swelling Latino population at
home and, as a bonus, blossoming U.S. soccer fans.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the strategic gamble paid off.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers such as Coca-Cola, MasterCard, Fuji film and Gillette
spent more than $26 million each to become official sponsors of the
World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The surge in popularity attracted more than a few latecomers--at a
price.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV hadn't planned on advertising during the World Cup, but
changed its mind last week. Travel Web site Expedia signed up on
Monday for air time.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely was at a premium, but a premium that was definitely
worth it," said Yolanda Macias, vice president of DirecTV's
international services, which includes a Spanish-language channel.</TE>
<TE>   Now Univision may break even. ESPN has established itself as the
English-language channel to turn to for soccer. Advertisers couldn't
be more pleased: Yahoo, for example, which runs the official Web site
of the World Cup, has been visited more than 1 billion times.</TE>
<TE>   "Advertisers see the potential," said Mark Abbott, chief operating
officer for Major League Soccer in New York. "There are more than
35.3 million Hispanics in the U.S. And that's more than there are
Canadians in Canada. Companies are sponsoring soccer to be able to
reach that group. In many ways, we are a soccer nation now."</TE>
<TE>   A key contributing factor to this year's World Cup fever was
completely unexpected--the success of the U.S. team. It entered
soccer's showpiece tournament as a 300-1 longshot. But with its
victory over Mexico, the U.S. team advances to the quarterfinals, its
best performance since the inaugural tournament 72 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   With each successive victory, ESPN executives say, the viewing
audience grows. The cable network has broadcast World Cup soccer
since 1982 (with the exception of 1990), but ratings comparisons with
previous years are difficult to draw because of the time-zone
differences between the U.S. host countries South Korea and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1 million viewers are tuning in to the rebroadcast games
on ABC--long after the results of the matches are widely known.</TE>
<TE>   Many, though, watch the live action. That's a sign that the
investment the TV networks, sports marketing machine and Major League
Soccer made may finally have paid off with the U.S. fan base.</TE>
<TE>   Take Steve Westman. For years, he spurned soccer. When L.A. hosted
the World Cup in 1994, he didn't go to any of the games, but he got
his first glimpse of some of the energy and hype.</TE>
<TE>   By 1998, he was sufficiently intrigued to watch the
well-publicized games. By this year, he was as big a fan as many of
his Latino friends who grew up with the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't miss it. I'm addicted," said Westman, 31, who watched the
broadcast from Korea until 1:30 a.m. Monday. When he doesn't stay up,
he wakes up at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. to catch the end of some 4:30 a.m.
games before heading to his job as a director of business and legal
affairs. "I didn't grow up a soccer fan, but the more I watched, the
more I appreciate the nuances.... Now, I watch these games, and I'm
riveted."</TE>
<TE>   Like many viewers, Westman said part of the thrill of the
traditionally non-American game is watching it on Spanish-language
TV, where yelps of "gooooaaaaaaaal!!!" are irresistible.</TE>
<TE>   "The English-speaking commentators seem a little droll, and with
the Spanish-language commentators, even though I'm not understanding
it, their enthusiasm is infectious," he said. "When someone scores,
they go totally nuts."</TE>

<HD>SHEEP: Wildlife Is Monitored</HD>
<DH>In an unrivaled effort to save a species, experts monitor
and manage the populations of cougars and deer as well as the
endangered Sierra sheep.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BISHOP, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Crook, Snoopy, Pancho and Lilly--more capable hounds you'll not
find--charge ahead, pursuing a mountain lion that knows this game
well.</LD>
<LD>   The last time the dogs were at its heels, the lion bolted up a
tree. The trackers arrived and shot him with a tranquilizer dart. He
fell from a branch, landed on his head and, while he lay in a daze,
they fitted him with a radio collar. Then they turned him loose.</LD>
<LD>   So now this cat wasn't about to get himself treed.</LD>
<TE>   The trackers forge on, huffing the thin air, pushing away shrubs,
following a chorus of yelps that fills the morning sky. After four
years, the signal from the collar is fading and that won't do.</TE>
<TE>   This lion, like all of the Eastern Sierra's lions, must
be watched. The region's deer must also be watched, along with its
bighorn sheep.</TE>
<TE>   These animals are wild now in name only. They're under a virtual
microscope, with the resolution cranked to an unparalleled level.</TE>
<TE>   Once, the three populations fluctuated according to natural
cycles. As deer populations grew, so did the number of mountain
lions. When deer herds thinned or fled, lions would eventually follow
suit. Some would sustain themselves on sheep until deer became more
plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   Now, there is no room for error. Too few deer with too many lions
could mean no more sheep. Man, who over the years has brought about a
world of change, is compelled to take total control.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we don't want to do as wildlife managers is let
it get to that point," says Steve Torres, a California Department of
Fish and Game biologist and an expert on large mammals. "But the
reality is, we're sometimes stuck with these kinds of situations...."</TE>
<TE>   Few places have the kind of intensive wildlife management
practiced in the Eastern Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   The aim is to preserve Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep, a subspecies
similar in appearance but genetically distinct from bighorn sheep
found throughout western North America. Sierra Nevada bighorns once
numbered as many as 1,000; a few years ago there were as few as 100
as they teetered on the brink of extinction.</TE>
<TE>   Hunting took a sizable toll, until it was banned in 1878. The
introduction of domestic sheep, which carried a respiratory bacteria,
wiped out thousands of bighorns, including many of the Sierra Nevada
variety.</TE>
<TE>   That meant big trouble in the face of growing numbers of mountain
lions.</TE>
<TE>   A California bounty on cougars ended in 1963. Sport hunting was
banned in 1972. Though mountain lions weren't--and still
aren't--considered threatened or endangered, California voters in
1990 gave them "specially protected" status by passing Proposition
117, which made it illegal even for wildlife managers to kill them
unless the animals threatened livestock or humans.</TE>
<TE>   More cougars crawled back into the picture. And although
they preyed primarily on deer, some had begun to "prey switch" to
bighorns.</TE>
<TE>   The sheep reacted by refusing to venture down out of the snow, to
the warmth and bounty of their winter ranges. Their numbers
plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 3, 2000, the Sierra Nevada bighorns were declared an
endangered species, and federal and state wildlife officials began an
unrivaled restoration effort.</TE>
<TE>   A team of 12 wildlife managers, operating with a 5-year funding
package provided by the Legislature, is charged with conserving five
herds scattered from Lone Pine to Lee Vining, and establishing seven
others in suitable locations. This means collaring and constantly
monitoring all of the mountain lions, closely watching mule deer
herds, moving sheep to new locations and, perhaps, growing sheep in
captivity for eventual release.</TE>
<TE>   In an exception to Proposition 117, the wildlife managers have
permission to kill mountain lions deemed an imminent threat to the
Sierra Nevada bighorns. They've killed only three so far. Ultimately,
they are in the business of balancing wild animal populations, and
setting down parameters for similar management schemes in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Says Vern Bleich, a Department of Fish and Game senior wildlife
biologist and the project leader: "If we come out of this in 15 years
and say we still have sheep and whacked 27 lions in the process but
with no understanding of the way things work, then we've failed
miserably.</TE>
<TE>   "So the pragmatic end of it is: Save, conserve and restore sheep.
The academic end of it is: Let's try to understand the way things work so
that in the future [wildlife] managers will have information to them,
which we didn't have."</TE>
<TE>   Looking for the Lion</TE>
<TE>   Trackers Jeff Ostergard and Mike Morgan have caught up to the
dogs, but have yet to close in on the lion with the aging collar. The
cat's territory is north of Crowley Lake and east of U.S. 395. The
animal poses no imminent threat but could easily cross the highway
and reach two areas holding bighorn sheep.</TE>
<TE>   Supervising the effort from behind the wheel of her pickup is
Becky Pierce, also a Department of Fish and Game biologist. Her
trackers spend their days in the field, picking up signals from
collars to pinpoint positions as best they can, and searching for
signs of new lions.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce is the one who decides when a lion has to be killed. Being
fairly new to the sheep restoration project, it's a call she has only
had to make once. It involved a collared lion that continually staked
out canyons used by sheep to reach their winter ranges.</TE>
<TE>   The lion they're after now is one of 11, from Lone Pine to Lee
Vining, wearing radio collars that emit a signal detectable for a
radius of 20 miles, depending on the terrain. Another is wearing a
more advanced global positioning satellite collar.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say that we have them all collared," Pierce says. But all
the new lion tracks they are spotting end up being from a marked, or
collared animal, "so we probably have the majority."</TE>
<TE>   The cats are highly territorial and require plenty of space. These
territories often overlap as they follow the migration of mule deer
to and from their summer ranges on or even beyond the Sierra crest,
to its western slope.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce has found that just as deer numbers are governed by the
availability of forage--mostly bitterbrush--lion numbers are governed
primarily by the availability of deer. However, there's a long time
lag before lions adjust to changes in deer numbers.</TE>
<TE>   She studied how deer in nearby Round Valley started to rebound in
1992 after the end of a prolonged drought that had knocked down the
herd to about 900 animals.</TE>
<TE>   Today, with the herd holding at about 2,500, mountain lions seem
to be experiencing an upsurge as well.</TE>
<TE>   As evidence, Pierce points in the direction of Wheeler Ridge, a
prominent abutment to Round Valley. An adult female lion has staked
out territory there, bringing with her 3-year-old juveniles.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole time I did my work through the '90s I never had a
female that brought three juveniles to this age--never," Pierce says.
"So that's telling me that all of a sudden things are better for the
lions.... "</TE>
<TE>   The lion she is referring to has killed only deer. But she remains
high on the watch list because Wheeler Ridge is the site of the
largest bighorn population, more than 75 strong.</TE>
<TE>   Foraging Animals</TE>
<TE>   The day before the attempt to re-collar the mountain lion, three
of the wildlife managers watch as an adult ewe traverses down a
near-sheer cliff to forage in a meadow near Wheeler Ridge. Bighorn
sheep, which spend their summers above the timberline, learn this
precarious art early. With the ewe are a 2-year-old male and a lamb.</TE>
<TE>   The sheep prefer the rocky, open terrain of the high country
because they can use their keen eyesight to spot potential threats.
But the low country beckons each spring; it is there that the lush
grasses first begin to grow. But it is also there, beneath the craggy
canyon stairways, that lions are most likely to wait in ambush.</TE>
<TE>   One of the wildlife managers, John Wehausen, a University of
California biologist and expert on Sierra Nevada bighorn, said he had
witnessed an ambush only once. He was at the mouth of a canyon near
Mt. Baxter and "saw a group of sheep running out of that canyon like
they'd seen the devil," he recalls. "And I saw this lion slinking
around in the rocks."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the sheep turned and scurried well up the steepest slope.
But a single ewe didn't climb far enough. Wehausen watched as the
cat, with a leap of about 25 feet, was on the ledge and with its jaws
clamped on the neck of the sheep.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all he can do to hang on there on the ledge, but it's total
grace," Wehausen says.</TE>
<TE>   "He grabs her by the throat with his teeth and pulls this
120-pound ewe down off of the rocks," he says.</TE>
<TE>   That was in 1982, when most of the Sierra Nevada bighorn were at
Mt. Baxter. Six years later, when the drought was knocking down
Eastern Sierra deer herds, the number of lion kills of bighorn sheep
had reached 49 in the Mt. Baxter area alone. Wildlife managers
started killing cougars, one each year in 1988, '89 and '90 near the
particularly besieged Lee Vining herd.</TE>
<TE>   But then came Proposition 117, putting the guns of wildlife
managers back on the racks.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of lions at the lower elevations, Wehausen says, kept
the sheep from visiting their traditional winter ranges. They were
more content in the upper recesses of their harshly frigid
high-mountain refuges, where food was scarce at best.</TE>
<TE>   Ewes that avoided winter ranges, Wehausen found, lambed a month
later than those that did not, and those lambs experienced a much
lower survival rate. The heavy snows of 1995 and 1998 ravaged the
herds, collectively leaving only about 100 animals.</TE>
<TE>   The wildlife managers lobbied for and won the federal
protection for the sheep. It provided the muscle to remove the remaining
domestic sheep grazing allotments, eliminating that threat.</TE>
<TE>   It reaffirmed the realization that much more needed to
be  learned if the Sierra Nevada bighorns, despite their sure-footed ways,
were to keep from tumbling off the face of the earth.</TE>
<TE>   Today, after successive mild winters, the drop in lion numbers and
the selective removal of mountain lions at Lee Vining, Wheeler Ridge
and Sawmill Canyon, bighorn number about 250.</TE>
<TE>   Another census is underway. The fitting of collars and collection
of data are ongoing. Sites for the establishment of new herds are
being identified and the feasibility of a captive breeding program is
being studied.</TE>
<TE>   Elusive Target</TE>
<TE>   Ostergard and Morgan eventually catch a glimpse of the cat with
the faulty collar, passing through trees ahead on the trail, with the
dogs in hot pursuit. Their high-pitch bawling indicates that the
predator has been treed.</TE>
<TE>   But suddenly the bawling stops and there is only the sound of the
wind. With a leap and a bound, and with a fresh breath of air, the
cat has again put himself ahead of the chase. The trackers corral the
dogs for the day, but they'll be back tomorrow. One way or another,
the cougar will be caught.</TE>

<HD>Contract Offered for Money, Trash Haulers Say</HD>
<DH>Compton: Two firms say they refused to pay. The business
went to a friend of a former mayor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A politically connected businessman promised to deliver a lucrative
Compton city garbage contract if the firms seeking the business paid
him at least $1 million, two garbage haulers have said.</LD>
<LD>   The separate accounts of the two waste haulers' competing efforts
to do business in Compton share a common theme: Executives at each
business said Michael Aloyan told them he could get them contracts if
they paid him.</LD>
<LD>   After they refused to pay, the Compton City Council last year
awarded Aloyan a 15-year contract to collect the garbage, according
to the haulers. The contract is estimated to be worth $100 million in
gross revenues.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Adnoff, a vice president at CalMet Services, said Aloyan
told him in late 1999 that there was "almost a guarantee" he could
get CalMet's residential contract renewed for a $1-million fee and
that "there was a good chance" he could get the firm the more
lucrative commercial contract.</TE>
<TE>   That contract was then held by Waste Management, which wanted to
keep the business. John Newell, a lawyer for Waste Management, said
Aloyan told one of his company's executives he was confident he could
get residential and commercial contracts himself and sell them to the
firm.</TE>
<TE>   The companies' accounts, given in interviews with The Times, raise
questions about whether Compton officials ceded control over
multimillion-dollar contracts to Aloyan.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan, a close friend of former Compton Mayor Omar Bradley,
testified as a federal witness in the mid-1990s that he had ferried
bribes on behalf of business interests to two other former Compton
council members in the early 1990s. He did not respond to repeated
requests for comment. His attorney, Richard Haft, had previously
denied Waste Management's account. Haft declined to comment on
CalMet's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley, who was mayor at the time the franchise was awarded to
Aloyan, said he did not know of any conversations Aloyan may have had
with the two waste haulers. Bradley said his vote with the majority
in the City Council's 4-1 decision last year to award the franchise
to Aloyan was made in the best interests of the city, giving
residents improved services at a fair price.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing to do with the deal, other than I voted for it,"
said Bradley, now a private citizen who is contesting in court the
mayoral election he lost last year.</TE>
<TE>   CalMet's Adnoff said that some time before the vote, he ran into
Bradley at a municipal convention. "Bradley said he was disappointed
we did not work out an arrangement with Aloyan," Adnoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley, whose brother is employed by Aloyan as safety director,
said he had no recollection of the conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Two other members of the council majority voting to award the
franchise to Aloyan, Bradley allies Amen Rahh and Delores Zurita, did
not return calls seeking comment. The fourth, Marcine Shaw, said she
followed the recommendations of city administrators. "As far as I'm
concerned or know," she said, "it was a clean deal."</TE>
<TE>   Bradley said CalMet and Waste Management might be trying to ruin
Aloyan by going public with their stories because they are angry they
lost lucrative contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor, who is African American, charged The Times with
racism for pursuing the story. "If this wasn't a black city, and if
your paper wasn't controlled by whites, this wouldn't be an issue,"
he said. "I want you to leave me alone."</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan allegedly made his first offer to sell a Compton
waste-hauling contract in late 1999, not long after municipal
elections in Compton in which Bradley-backed candidates cemented
control of the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, a company called CalSan, which held the city's
residential contract, was being acquired by Metropolitan Waste
Disposal. The new enterprise was renamed CalMet.</TE>
<TE>   Such acquisitions are not unusual in the Southern California
garbage industry, which has been marked by consolidation in recent
years as smaller companies have struggled with costly modernization
necessary to meet tougher state recycling standards.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan had worked for CalSan in the mid-1990s after it had
acquired another trash company that employed him as general manager.
That trash company, Murcole, held the Compton residential trash
contract before it was absorbed by CalSan.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to get the council to renew its contract, CalSan officials
said they made charitable contributions and campaign contributions to
City Council members, including Bradley. Company officials said they
also proposed better service.</TE>
<TE>   CalSan's lawyer at the time, Richard Haft, who now represents
Aloyan, advised executives that this conventional approach would be
fruitless, Adnoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Haft counseled CalSan that "the only way you're going to get the
agreement is to use Mike Aloyan," Adnoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Haft declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In his discussions with CalSan and CalMet in late 1999 and early
2000, Adnoff said Aloyan claimed he could renew or extend the
contract for CalMet if CalMet made him a 50% partner in the contract
or paid him $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "He said the residential was almost a guarantee," Adnoff said. "He
thought there was a good chance he could get the commercial."</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan did not explain why he was confident the council would give
the residential contract to whomever Aloyan directed, Adnoff said.</TE>
<TE>   But Aloyan "made it very clear that the contract was under his
control and whoever was going to get it was going to have to deal
with him," said VerLyn Jensen, then a lawyer for Metropolitan, now an
attorney for CalMet.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen said Thomas Blackman, a Metropolitan executive who is now
president of CalMet, told him Aloyan had asked for a sum in the "very
substantial seven figures" for securing the franchise. Blackman,
through Jensen, declined requests to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   The money would be paid only when the contract was secured, Jensen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen said CalMet rejected Aloyan's offers because "we refuse to
get into any arrangement that would smell of corruption."</TE>
<TE>   It is lawful in almost all California jurisdictions for a lobbyist
to be paid on a contingency basis, like a salesperson on commission,
for helping obtain a government contract. Aloyan's alleged activities
would be illegal if they involved collusion with the City Council,
said San Francisco attorney Jim Sutton, a specialist in California
political law.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan is a well-known figure in Compton politics.</TE>
<TE>   After emigrating from Armenia in 1987, he worked his way up to
become general manager of Murcole, holder of the Compton residential
contract, and in the early 1990s, he later testified, he acted as an
intermediary for its president's secret payoffs to a politician.</TE>
<TE>   Testifying as a federal prosecution witness in 1995, Aloyan said
he passed a $5,000 check from Murcole through another intermediary to
Walter R. Tucker III, then Compton's mayor, in exchange for Tucker's
vote in favor of a rate hike. Aloyan also testified that he arranged
for a $2,500 contribution to Tucker's congressional campaign in
return for a vote in favor of extending Murcole's contract.</TE>
<TE>   Tucker denied receiving any payments but testified that Aloyan had
offered him a $100,000 bribe and part ownership in a proposed card
club project. Tucker said he turned Aloyan down. Jurors deadlocked on
the counts involving Aloyan's testimony, but convicted Tucker on
other charges of extorting payoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan, who testified under a limited grant of immunity, was not
charged with any crime.</TE>
<TE>   The same investigation yielded a 1996 prosecution of Patricia
Moore, then a Compton City Council member. Aloyan testified that he
paid her to soften her opposition to the card club proposal. Aloyan
passed checks from a gambling corporation to Moore's campaign
manager, according to testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan testified that he gave her checks for nonexistent
consulting services so that she would not stand in the way of his
casino plans. Jurors voted to convict Moore for receiving illegal
payoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Hearings held in connection with Moore's case produced other
evidence of corruption in Compton's waste operations. Federal agents
said Moore had confessed to secretly receiving monthly payments from
the firm that held the city's commercial waste-hauling contract,
Western Waste Industries.</TE>
<TE>   Western Waste was later acquired by Waste Management.</TE>
<TE>   As contracts held by Waste Management and CalMet neared their
mid-2000 expiration dates, the Bradley-led City Council voted to end
private contracting. They decided to form a city sanitation
department.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan was hired at $300,000 a year to set up and manage the
department. The city prepared to issue $6 million in bonds to pay for
garbage trucks, bins and other equipment.</TE>
<TE>   On May 5, 2000, six days before Aloyan signed his formal
management agreement with the city, Aloyan approached a Waste
Management executive with an offer to sell his company for $4
million, said Newell, the Waste Management lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   As The Times reported last month, the Waste Management executive
asked why Waste Management should pay so much for a company whose
only asset was a $300,000 consulting contract.</TE>
<TE>   Newell said Aloyan's response was, " 'I'll have the city.' "</TE>
<TE>   Newell said the executive, whom he would not identify by name,
understood Aloyan to mean he was confident of not just managing, but
owning the city garbage-collection franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Newell said the executive reported the conversation to him just
after it happened because it was suspicious that Aloyan would offer
to sell a franchise he did not own.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we didn't do it," Newell said.</TE>
<TE>   Eight months later, Aloyan's alleged prediction came true. The
City Council, led by Bradley, voted to award him the city's hauling
contract for 15 years, allowing Aloyan to use garbage trucks and
other equipment bought with the city's low-interest municipal bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan paid a franchise fee of $2 million to the city and agreed
to repay principal and interest on the bonds. No other firms were
invited to bid.</TE>

<HD>L.A. County Proposes Cuts to Clinics, School Programs</HD>
<DH>Health: Reductions are the first step in trimming a deficit
that could hit $800 million by 2005.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI and EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County health officials are recommending the closure of
11 health clinics, the elimination of its school-based medical
programs and the conversion of High Desert Hospital into an
outpatient clinic as the first steps toward closing an $800-million
deficit, according to documents obtained by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals would amount to the deepest cuts in the county's
frayed public health system in seven years. But they may represent
just the beginning of a dramatic reduction and restructuring of the
system.</LD>
<LD>   The health department's plan, to be considered by the Board of
Supervisors next week, outlines far more severe cuts to come in
October should the county fail to persuade the federal government to
once again bail it out of a financial crisis. In that event, the
county would consider ending inpatient services at Harbor-UCLA near
Torrance and Olive View in Sylmar, privatizing Rancho Los Amigos
Medical Center in Downey and shuttering its network of nearly 100
private outpatient clinics.</LD>
<TE>   This is not the first time the board has been confronted with the
prospect of closing hospitals and clinics due to financial hardship.
It has relied on federal bailouts and aggressive borrowing to avoid
drastic cuts. But some medical and county officials believe those
moves worsened the problem and that supervisors this time will not be
able to avoid painful curtailments.</TE>
<TE>   For several weeks, health officials have hinted at the cuts they
were considering to deal with a steady decline in federal aid. But
late last week they began briefing supervisors on what appear to be
their final recommendations, which are scheduled to be discussed at
the supervisors' June 26 meeting. The plans will be posted on the
department's Web site Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed cuts amount to a declaration of defeat for some of
the county's most highly touted health initiatives that were launched
after its last major health care crisis in 1995. After receiving a
$1-billion bailout by the Clinton administration, county officials
pledged to scale back large hospitals and create an efficient network
of outpatient clinics in neighborhoods and public schools.</TE>
<TE>   But that bailout is exhausted, and more recent federal aid is
dwindling. The county faces an $800-million deficit in three years.
With the state and federal governments wrestling with their own
deficits, county medical officials now have modest hopes.</TE>
<TE>   "The exercise we're going through here is to try and balance a
budget, not to meet all the health care needs that exist in Los
Angeles County," said Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, the county's new health
director. "That's not what we're trying to do. It's not like we're
meeting those already."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the county receives federal aid, Garthwaite is
recommending cutting inpatient services at High Desert, closing 11 of
the 18 health centers, the six clinics in Los Angeles schools and
reducing contracts with private clinics by 25%. In all, those
facilities registered 350,000 patient visits annually. The health
department has not yet determined how many full-time jobs would be
eliminated by those initial reductions, but an earlier estimate for
slightly more severe trims put the number at about 4,600, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The service reductions would fall most heavily on people like Tina
Avalos, 66, who choked up in the waiting room of the Alhambra Health
Center on Monday when she heard it was slated for closure.</TE>
<TE>   "What will my daughter and I do without this place?" Avalos asked.
Two years ago, she recalled, doctors at the clinic rushed her to
County-USC Medical Center when she had trouble breathing due to
swallowing a fish bone.</TE>
<TE>   Like many in the waiting room Monday, Avalos and her daughter,
Linda Flores, had to take a cab from their home to the clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "This is truly the only way my mother could have been treated,"
Flores said. "We can't afford the $30 cab ride to the next clinic,
and we can't afford the $1,000 trip to the ER."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke has four similar health centers
in her district slated for closure. She said she does not want to
eliminate them but may not have a choice.</TE>
<TE>   "If I do it, it will be with tremendous, tremendous heart-breaking
and considerable sorrow," Burke said. "And I wish I didn't have to.
But unless something happens in the next few days, we're going to
have to do what we have to do."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors have always had difficulty cutting the health
department. In December, they voted to study expanding some of the
hospitals that now may be downsized into clinics. The move was part
of a decade-old pattern in which supervisors talk about the need to
cut the health budget, then approve more spending in hopes of getting
more money in the future.</TE>
<TE>   It will be difficult for supervisors to maintain the pattern this
year, because their traditional escape routes may be sealed. The
federal government has signaled that it will not give the county the
same help it has in the past. The state is grappling with record
deficits.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are the only two places that we can look for any kind of
remedy, and both of them don't seem prepared to act or even respond,"
Supervisor Gloria Molina said. "We're kind of at the end of our rope.
We have nowhere else to go."</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors do have some options--and some time. The deficits
will not appear until next year. The county has about $500 million in
reserves to keep the department afloat. In the past, the board has
taken on a controversial amount of debts, even mortgaging its own
offices, to keep hospitals open. But many officials, including the
county's budget chief, have criticized such methods as fiscally
unsound.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Tarnowsky, a spokesman for the union that represents most of
the health department's 22,000 employees, said it was "irresponsible"
for the board to consider cutting medical services to poor people
before their budget had even reached a deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand how difficult it is" to find new sources of money,
Tarnowsky said. "All we're saying is that that ought to be the focus,
not cuts."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Burke, however, said the county must cut immediately.
"The more we delay, the greater the problem," she said. "If we had
done some of these a little earlier, maybe we would not have the
magnitude [of problem] that we have now."</TE>
<TE>   Cutting health services is guaranteed to trigger a political
imbroglio at the board. Supervisors are traditionally protective of
health facilities in their own districts. The most significant prior
cut in health services was the shrinking of the replacement of
County-USC from 750 to 600 beds, which became one of the state's
nastiest political battles and took three years to resolve.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area
served by High Desert, said the health department needs to ensure the
care provided by the hospital can be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to ensure that North County residents have access to
medical services," Antonovich said.</TE>
<TE>   Grim as supervisors sounded about the first round of cuts, all
agreed that those cuts are nothing compared to the health
department's proposals for the fall.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts at High Desert and clinics, coupled with other
administrative savings, are expected to save $158 million by next
year. Health director Garthwaite is proposing those reductions even
if the county gets additional help from the federal government this
fall.</TE>
<TE>   But should that help not materialize, Garthwaite has sketched out
an additional $259 million in reductions. Though not yet fixed, they
include the conversion of Harbor and Olive View into clinics. Both
hospitals operate busy emergency rooms and have a combined 930
licensed inpatient beds. High Desert, by contrast, has 75beds and no
ER.</TE>
<TE>   Closing major hospitals could overwhelm the region's entire
medical system, health experts say. Emergency rooms would be snarled,
and private trauma centers that treat victims of gunshots would
collapse under the strain.</TE>

<HD>Fans Torn Between 2 Nations</HD>
<DH>Sports: Some side with the U.S., some with Mexico, and
others have mixed emotions as the U.S. advances in World Cup
competition.</DH>

<LD>As the Mexican saying goes, the week begins very badly for the man
who is hanged on a Monday.</LD>
<LD>   And so it began for the thousands of ever-hopeful Southern
California fans of the Mexican national soccer team, who launched
their workweek with hang-dog looks Monday after another bitter defeat
at the hands of the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "These countries are like our mother and father," said Mexican
immigrant Urbano Gonzalez, 40, of Cudahy, who watched the game at
Alma's Restaurant in East Los Angeles. "But you always have a little
more emotion for your mother."</LD>
<TE>   With a velvet depiction of Pancho Villa as backdrop, about 60
patrons stood for the Mexican national anthem, only to slump in
disbelief, two hours later, as the final seconds ticked away. The
United States won 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Police had prepared for possible riots after the game, but apart
from a rock thrown at a Santa Ana police officer--which resulted in
one arrest--no serious incidents were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Boisterous, flag-waving crowds, spontaneous soccer games and
screeching tires that dominated main drags such as Whittier Boulevard
in East Los Angeles or Pacific Boulevard in Huntington Park before
the game were replaced by police blockades and eerie silence as TV
screens flickered in nearly every house.</TE>
<TE>   By the second U.S. goal, Jose Angel Espinoza stood outside Alma's,
chewing sunflower seeds and ruminating on the snake-bit quality of
Mexican soccer. "They've never had the capacity to win the big game.
Never, ever," said the 50-year-old native of Culiacan, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "Truth be told, Mexico accomplished a lot," Espinoza said. "I
didn't think they'd tie Italy, or beat Croatia. But the U.S., they
went from being down and they raised themselves. They're a good team.
Can they beat Germany? Why not? Of course they can. Who knows what's
going to happen next. This has been the World Cup of surprises."</TE>
<TE>   At Downtown Disney in Anaheim, Mexico native Jorge Acosta, 31,
wore his green Mexico jersey with pride. He was pleased to see so
many Mexico fans at the quintessentially American resort. Chants of
"U-S-A, U-S-A" competed with cries of "si, se puede, si se puede,"
Spanish that translates roughly as "yes, we can."</TE>
<TE>   "Mexico fans are true fans," Acosta said. "The Americans, if you
ask them the names of their players, they can't tell you. They're
only rooting for them because they made it this far. Mexico fans are
passionate about every game."</TE>
<TE>   About the only public place where fans of the U.S. team
outnumbered Mexico boosters was at Staples Center Grand Reserve Club,
where about 250 watched the game in an event sponsored by the Los
Angeles Galaxy professional soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   With so much pro-Mexico nostalgia, it was hard for some to root
for their adopted home. Gilbert Duran was the only one to clap in the
Hi D' Hi Lounge on La Verne Avenue at Whittier Boulevard, one of a
few bars in East Los Angeles that remained open for the game. "I love
Mexico, but the United States is the melting pot of all
nationalities," said Duran, 49, whose ear-to-ear grin stood out in a
crowd of dejected faces.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. team fans were even more outnumbered in Tijuana, where Cesar
Salazar, an L.A. construction worker, joined thousands looking for
full-octane soccer mania--and a place to wager. "My heart is with
Mexico, but my head says the U.S.," Salazar said as he sat in the
Caliente betting parlor and waited for his $10 pro-U.S. wager to pay
off. "The Americans are taller; the Mexicans have spirit but are too
short."</TE>
<TE>   There was no shortage of nationalism, which hung in the air like
confetti. Flag-waving, face-painted crowds surged around the giant
statue of Aztec ruler Cuauhtemoc. "Tijuana is the only place to be
tonight!" shouted Martin Nguyen, a car appraiser from Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   At Kalua's Nite Club in Huntington Park, patrons sat glumly.</TE>
<TE>   "Que verguenza [What a shame]," said bartender Isidra San Juan.
When a waitress came over, she handed her a few napkins.</TE>
<TE>   "Go ahead. Cry. Cry," she told her.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't cry for Mexico," the waitress replied. "I cry for my
$100. I just lost a bet."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, only a few fans gathered at Pacific Boulevard and
Florence Avenue, where past celebrations have ended in vandalism and
violence.</TE>
<TE>   "They were the only team I cared for," said Juan Carlos
Plascencia, standing with friends outside the Gallo Giro restaurant.
"It's over for me."</TE>
<TE>   But others said they may soon be draped in American flags.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my second country ... Mi patria" said Luis Donaldo
Gutierrez. "U.S.A. all the way."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Manuel Gamiz, Richard Marosi, Tony Perry,
David McKibben and Monte Morin contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>City Gears Up to Ban Big-Rigs</HD>
<DH>Moorpark: Council members commission a study on whether to
lobby the state to prohibit truck traffic on California 118.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scott Mosher saw them again Monday on his way to work in Moorpark.
They lined California 118, chugging along the main drag through the
suburban city of 32,000.</LD>
<LD>   "Trucks," he said, "as far away as you could see."</LD>
<LD>   As executive director of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Moorpark, Mosher
has a vested interest in keeping these trucks at bay. Many of the 110
children who visit his center walk there from nearby apartments,
crossing the truck route on their way.</LD>
<TE>   Similarly, local business owners complain that customers are put
off by the trucks. About 3,700 a day traverse New Los Angeles Avenue,
meaning one out of five vehicles on that road is a truck, according
to the Ventura County Transportation Commission.</TE>
<TE>   After years of talk, the city is setting out to do something about
the big-rigs. Council members have authorized a $20,000 study to
determine whether Moorpark should embark on a full-scale lobbying
effort to prohibit truck traffic except vehicles making local
deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   City officials know that would not be easy.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is the 118 a state highway, but Moorpark's portion is
designated as part of the National Highway System, a group of
arterial routes identified as needed for national defense and
interstate travel.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several months, consulting firm Parsons in Pasadena
will conduct the initial study. Its aim, in part, is to determine the
city's chances of success before taxpayers make a greater investment.</TE>
<TE>   Since Moorpark's incorporation in 1983, residents have complained
about trucks. "Opponents would say the road was there before the
city, but that's little solace," said city Public Works Director Ken
Gilbert.</TE>
<TE>   Until highways 118 and 23 were connected in the mid-1990s, trucks
snaked through narrow city streets, past single-family homes. The
connector road curbed that practice, but city officials say the new
stretch of highway opened the floodgates for additional truck
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The problem has also become a political liability for sitting
council members. Although none endorses truck traffic, challengers
say that incumbents haven't done anything about the mess.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the council has broached the issue several times. In
1989, 1994 and 1999, the city sought help through Caltrans. Each
time, the state transportation agency advised the city to submit a
formal application to ban truck traffic, a process so complex and
time-consuming that the city was put off. Three years ago, the city
began looking for a consultant to begin the process. There were no
takers, officials said, until Parsons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as if we've stood idly by and done nothing about this,"
said Mayor Pat Hunter. "When you have a state highway that runs
through your community and you have no authority over it ... we can't
even determine what kind of signage goes on that highway."</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Forsythe, deputy director of the Ventura County
Transportation Commission, said the city isn't likely to get far,
even with a consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "I think their chances are pretty slim," Forsythe said. "And there
are financial considerations. If they were able to get trucks off the
road, they might lose road funding as well. When the consultant
report comes in, I think it's going to say, 'This sounds nice but
we're really not going to be able to do this.' "</TE>
<TE>   Warren Hoemann, vice president of the California Trucking Assn.,
said his group is open to efforts to set up portable scales and rest
areas along the highway around Moorpark. But it opposes the city's
bid to stop trucks from passing through.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an essential part of the network we need throughout the
state to deliver goods," Hoemann said. "You have a community that was
largely a farming community that's been turned into a bedroom
community. The farming community was very accustomed to trucking
because it was the lifeblood of what they did. In a suburban
community, the same connection isn't there. But every Wal-Mart and
Costco in town couldn't live if the trucks weren't coming in."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, however, said the city can't continue to handle the
traffic. Pointing to a state law passed two years ago limiting heavy
trucks from driving certain roads in the Bay Area, he said the city
shouldn't abandon hope yet.</TE>
<TE>   "This may be [truckers'] preferred alternative," Hunter said, "but
their preferred alternative is having a debilitating effect on our
community."</TE>

<LD>The garage door at the Salt Lake City home where 14-year-old

kidnapping, the girl's father said.</LD>
<LD>   But Edward Smart told reporters at a daily news briefing that he
closed the garage door--which could have given an intruder entry into
the family's upscale house--before going to bed.</LD>

<LD>Prosecutors in Salt Lake City can try avowed polygamist Tom Green on
child rape charges for having sex with one of his wives when she was
13, a judge ruled.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for Green had argued that the two had sex in Mexico and
that Utah authorities have no standing to prosecute the crime.</LD>
<LD>   But District Judge Donald Eyre said there is evidence that Green
and the girl's mother hatched a "criminal conspiracy" in Utah, so
prosecutors in this state can pursue the charges.</LD>
<TE>   A trial is scheduled for June 24.</TE>
<TE>   Green is serving a five-year prison sentence for bigamy and
failing to pay the state back for child support that was given to his
five wives and 30 children.</TE>

<LD>Bad weather in Florida forced NASA managers to postpone the landing
of the space shuttle Endeavour, leaving the record-setting former
crew of the International Space Station in orbit at least a day
longer.</LD>
<LD>   Broad bands of rain and clouds swept over the Kennedy Space
Center, and the possibility of thunderstorms and hail caused NASA to
call off two landing opportunities at 12:59 and 2:36 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   The weather was not expected to be any better at the Kennedy Space
Center today. The shuttle has enough food and supplies on board to
stay in space until Thursday, officials said.</LD>

<HD>Justices Uphold Transit Searches</HD>
<DH>Law: High court says subtle police pressure to cooperate
doesn't mean bus or train passengers must be told that they have the
right to refuse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court ruled Monday that police can subtly pressure
passengers on buses, trains and other public transit systems to agree
to be searched, saying officers need not tell the riders they have a
right to refuse.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-3 ruling upholds a common tactic in the war on drugs. Bush
administration lawyers said these mass searches will also be useful
in the war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Under the 4th Amendment, a police officer normally cannot search
or seize a person without some evidence of wrongdoing. But that does
not stop officers from asking people to allow themselves to be
searched, the justices said.</LD>
<TE>   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy described such encounters as
"consensual" and "voluntary," even when the officers are armed and
have blocked the aisles of a bus.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's decision overturned a lower court in Atlanta, which said
a "show of authority" by armed officers should not be allowed to
intimidate people into giving up the privacy rights.</TE>
<TE>   That ruling threw out drug evidence seized from two men who were
arrested in Tallahassee, Fla., where the Greyhound bus in which they
were riding had made a stopover.</TE>
<TE>   Armed officers boarded the bus and walked down the aisle. They
asked each passenger whether they could look at their bags.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers Christopher Drayton and Clifton Brown were wearing
heavy jackets and baggy pants on a warm day. An officer described
them as overly cooperative.</TE>
<TE>   After they freely agreed to let him check their bags in the
overhead luggage rack, the officer said in a low voice, "Mind if I
check you?"</TE>
<TE>   The men did not respond directly, except to lift their hands.
While two officers stood by, the third patted down the men and on
both felt a hard object on the inside of their thighs. They were
carrying packages of cocaine wrapped in duct tape.</TE>
<TE>   The two men were convicted on drug-trafficking charges. But the
U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled the search was coercive and
unreasonable because no reasonable person would think he was free to
refuse.</TE>
<TE>   Disagreeing, Kennedy said the encounter between the officers and
the passengers was neither "coercive nor confrontational. There was
no application of force, no intimidating movement, no overwhelming
show of force, no brandishing of weapons, no blocking of exits, no
threat, no command, not even an authoritative tone of voice," he
wrote in U.S. vs. Drayton, 01-631.</TE>
<TE>   It is true the officers did not tell the men that they could
refuse to be searched, Kennedy said. But, he added, the court has
already made it clear that police officers need not "always inform
citizens of their right to refuse when seeking permission to conduct
a warrantless consent search."</TE>
<TE>   In dissent, Justice David H. Souter said the majority's opinion
had an "air of unreality" about it. "No reasonable passenger could
have believed ... he had a free choice to ignore the police
altogether," he said. Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg agreed. But the bus-search case carried an air of unreality
for another reason, Souter noted.</TE>
<TE>   Airline passengers know they and their bags can and will be
searched, and no one claims these searches violate the 4th Amendment.
Because passengers are on notice they can be searched, they cannot
claim the inspections violate what the court has called a "reasonable
expectation of privacy."</TE>
<TE>   If buses or trains were terrorist targets, the government could
announce that all passengers are subject to being searched at any
time, and thereby defeat in advance the claims that a particular
search was unreasonable.</TE>

<HD>A Forestry Career Goes Up in Smoke</HD>
<DH>Wildfire: The Forest Service ranger accused of sparking
flames was known for her love of nature. She now faces up to 20 years
in prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Terry Barton was living her life's dream, working for the Forest
Service and spending her days among her beloved trees. That dream
shattered, along with the property and lives of thousands of people
across Colorado, when marital disquiet led Barton to put a match to a
letter from her estranged husband, setting off the largest wildfire
in state history.</LD>
<LD>   Barton, an 18-year veteran of the Forest Service, was not in her
green ranger's uniform but in green overalls and handcuffs during an
appearance in federal court here Monday. Officials said she admitted
starting the 103,000-acre Hayman fire, which is still burning across
four counties.</LD>
<LD>   Barton moved near Florissant, a small community about 100 miles
south of Denver, from Dunlap, Calif., where she grew up. Friends and
neighbors in both states tell stories of Barton's good deeds and
kindness. But federal prosecutors asked the judge on Monday to deny
bail in part because of the public anger directed at Barton for
starting the fire, which has forced the evacuation of 6,000 residents
and destroyed 25 homes.</LD>
<TE>   "She would return to a community in which there is considerable
hostility toward her, which adds to the possibility of her being a
flight risk," said U.S. Atty. John W. Suthers.</TE>
<TE>   Federal magistrate Michael Watanabe ordered Barton to remain in
custody until a bond hearing Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Barton is charged with three criminal counts: setting fire to
timber in a national forest, damaging federal property in excess of
$1,000 and making false statements to investigators. If convicted on
all charges, she faces up to 20 years in prison and up to $250,000 in
fines.</TE>
<TE>   Before the strange unraveling of her story, Barton was hailed as a
hero for having first reported the blaze at a campsite on June 8
while on patrol enforcing a ban on open fires.</TE>
<TE>   But two days after the fire started in Pike National Forest,
investigators began to doubt her version of events. According to the
arrest affidavit, it became clear that Burton could not have smelled
smoke from the distance she gave officers and that the fire spread
too quickly to have come from a campfire.</TE>
<TE>   Confronted by Forest Service special agents on Saturday, Barton
confessed, prosecutors said, and told her story in writing and on
videotape.</TE>
<TE>   Barton, 38, was described by acquaintances Monday as someone who
grew up in love with the forest. She and her older sister Carla were
raised in Dunlap, a small down-on-its-heels rural community in the
oak tree-spotted foothills near Fresno. Barton and her husband, John,
have known each other since attending Dunlap Elementary School. Even
then, friends said, all Barton wanted to do was be out of doors,
around animals and in the woods.</TE>
<TE>   Local storeowners Jordan and Linda Judd have known Barton all her
life, back when she was little Terry Lynn Haddock climbing trees.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a very nice person from a very nice family," Jordan Judd
said.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents, Bill and Wanda Sue Haddock, live in a modest home in
Dunlap. Wanda Sue Haddock spoke briefly to a reporter Monday but
declined to be interviewed. Bill Haddock was the town's most
accomplished freelance mechanic before being disabled in an auto
accident.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors in Dunlap on Monday said they didn't recognize Barton's
name from the news and said any criminal behavior was out of
character for her.</TE>
<TE>   "Her husband must have made her horribly upset," said a longtime
neighbor who asked not to be identified. "I can't imagine the Terry I
know would do this deliberately."</TE>
<TE>   Barton parlayed her love of the outdoors into various part-time
jobs with the Forest Service and began working at Sequoia National
Forest in 1991, where her job was planting trees.</TE>
<TE>   The Bartons moved to Colorado six years ago, neighbors said, to
give Terry a chance at a better job with the Forest Service. John
Barton worked as a carpenter. The couple have two teenage daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall Terry Barton was hired as a permanent part-time worker,
working nine months of the year, earning about $1,500 a month. Her
duties included answering questions from the public and policing
campgrounds. Much of this spring she has been responsible for
enforcing the state's ban on open fires.</TE>
<TE>   A friend said the amount of time Barton spent on her job caused
friction in the marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "She loved her job, loved it," said Joe Burlingame, a friend from
California. "We think the job had something to do with the problems
she and her husband were having. This could only have happened if she
was under duress. There was no intent [to set the fire]."</TE>
<TE>   The couple appear to have had problems for some time and John
Barton moved out of the house a year ago, friends said. The stress
associated with the split was taking its toll on Terry Barton, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the midst of emotional turmoil she made a bad decision," said
Randy McKinley, pastor at Mountain Community Church, where the
Bartons were sometime congregants. He said residents came into the
church to talk Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Some want to string her up, because of what she's done to
people's lives," McKinley said. "Others tell stories of what a caring
individual she is."</TE>
<TE>   McKinley recalled the time Barton insisted on driving a couple
dying of cancer to Kansas to see friends and family for the last
time.</TE>
<TE>   "She dropped everything and drove them to Kansas," McKinley said.
"That's the kind of person she is."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is in such a charitable mood. The Hayman fire is one
of a dozen major fires that have swept across the state, sending
residents to evacuation shelters, damaging public land and destroying
homes. The total cost to fight the Hayman fire is estimated to be $52
million, and officials don't expect to put out the blaze before fall.</TE>
<TE>   "We're dumbfounded by it all," said Christi Schaller, a waitress
at the Fossil Inn, a restaurant in Florissant. "Being in the business
she's in, knowing our area and being here for so long, it's just
unbelievable. Because of what happened, we're all out of our houses.
If she got out, somebody would probably make an attempt on her life.
That's how mad people are."</TE>
<TE>   The Bartons' street was patrolled by sheriff's deputies Monday, as
a precaution.</TE>
<TE>   Barton comes to trial at a time of heightened awareness of the
damage a wildfire can cause. Colorado is experiencing its worst
drought on record and those dry conditions are contributing to the
state's most destructive fire season ever.</TE>
<TE>   Last week state and federal officials beefed up penalties for
those found to have started fires. The fine for violating the state's
fire ban was $25; now, violators will have to appear before a judge
and face fines up to $5,000 and six months in jail.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to see how serious this is and the penalties must
reflect this," said Colorado Atty. Gen. Ken Salazar in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Suthers said Monday that Barton's high-profile
prosecution may serve as a deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of people have a hard time believing that a really
small campfire will end up burning 100,000 acres," Suthers said. "Now
we know it can. The fact is that everybody in the state of Colorado
knows the issues here."</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators closed in on Barton by questioning her time
and again, taking apart her story. After a week, investigators
concluded that "the fire was deliberately set and staged to look like
an escaped campfire," according to the arrest affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Agriculture Agent Joseph Crook wrote that Barton told
investigators that while on patrol she grew angry about a letter she
received that day from her estranged husband. She told them she
decided to burn it in a campfire ring.</TE>
<TE>   After setting fire to the letter, she told investigators she left
the campsite. But as she drove away and looked back she saw the fire
had grown. She said she went back and tried to put it out.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Hayman fire, which had been 47% contained, blew up
in high winds and high temperatures Monday, causing the evacuation of
several hundred homes near Woodland Park, about 70 miles south of
Denver. More than 2,200 firefighters are battling the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   In the southwest part of the state, near Durango, another wildfire
forced residents to flee 700 homes Monday. About 860 firefighters are
working the blaze, which has been growing daily and is now the
nation's highest-priority wildfire. Officials believe the fire was
caused by a cigarette.</TE>

Dunlap contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Other Unresolved Murder Cases</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1989, Mississippi authorities reopened the case of Medgar Evers, a
civil rights leader slain more than two decades earlier. Their
success in prosecuting Byron De La Beckwith for the crime prompted
other law enforcement officials to begin an earnest reevaluation of
unsolved cases from the civil rights era.</LD>
<LD>   The effort has reaped convictions in half a dozen cases. Most
recently, Bobby Frank Cherry was found guilty last month in the Sept.
15, 1963, bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham,
Ala. He was the third man to be convicted in that notorious attack,
which killed four black girls.</LD>
<LD>   But other murders from those years remain unresolved. In addition
to three such cases examined by The Times beginning today, they
include:</LD>
<TE>   Montgomery, Ala.--Willie Edwards was forced at gunpoint to jump
off a bridge in 1957, allegedly by a group of Ku Klux Klan members. A
grand jury review in 1999 ended with no indictments.</TE>
<TE>   Natchez, Miss.--Wharlest Jackson, a local treasurer for the
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, was killed by a
bomb in his pickup truck in 1967, allegedly by whites angry about his
promotion at a tire and rubber company. The case was reopened in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, Miss.--Ben Brown, a civil rights organizer, was shot in
1967 when police fired on demonstrators at a black college. The case
was reopened in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   York, Pa.--Lillie Belle Allen, a preacher's daughter, was shot
during civil unrest in 1969. Nine whites, including the city's former
mayor, recently were charged and are likely to go to trial this year.</TE>
<TE>   Homochitto National Forest, Miss.--Ben Chester White was killed in
1966 by assailants allegedly hoping that the killing of a black would
lure the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to the area so they could
assassinate him. A white man, acquitted in 1967 in state court, has
been charged again in federal court. His trial has been delayed
because of his failing health.</TE>
<TE>   Hattiesburg, Miss.--Vernon Dahmer, the local NAACP president, died
when his home was firebombed in 1966. Five Klansmen were convicted,
but the case against a sixth is stalled because of the poor health of
a key witness.</TE>
<TE>   Martinsville, Ind.--Carol Jenkins was slain in 1968 while selling
encyclopedias door to door. Last month, a 70-year-old white man was
arrested at a nursing home after his daughter turned him in.</TE>
<TE>   Mims, Fla.--Civil rights organizer Harry T. Moore and his wife,
Henrietta, were killed when their home was blown up on Christmas
night 1951. One suspect committed suicide after being interviewed by
the FBI; another spoke of the killings in a deathbed confession.
Authorities theorize that others were involved.</TE>

<HD>Lindh's Attorneys Lose Bids for Dismissal, Trial in Bay
Area</HD>
<DH>Courts: A federal judge says trying to find jurors
unfamiliar with the case is futile. One key defense motion is
unresolved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Monday denied requests by defense attorneys to
dismiss charges against John Walker Lindh, the young American who
fought for the Taliban, and rejected a proposal to move the trial to
Northern California, where Lindh was raised.</LD>
<LD>   In turning down the half-dozen requests, Judge T.S. Ellis III said
that because so many people already know about the Lindh case, it
seemed fruitless to move the trial, scheduled for August, in search
of a completely unaffected jury pool.</LD>
<LD>   "Indeed," the judge said in jest, "we might have to go to the
planet Pluto to find inhabitants who have not heard of it."</LD>
<TE>   Ellis' rulings came at the end of a nearly all-day hearing in
which defense attorneys argued a number of formal requests to
persuade the judge to dismiss the indictment against Lindh. At day's
end, they came away empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   Still unresolved was the most critical pretrial motion: a defense
request to exclude a series of statements Lindh made to military and
FBI interrogators after his capture in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   That is scheduled to come up in a pretrial hearing next month.
Should the defense succeed there, it could gut the heart of the
government's case and, some experts say, lead to a plea bargain.</TE>
<TE>   But Monday was clearly the government's day, and so confident were
federal prosecutors that they would prevail, they spent little time
explaining to the judge why he should deny the defense requests.
Defense attorneys, in contrast, were given extra time to make their
arguments.</TE>
<TE>   The defense's key requests centered on dismissing the indictment
or moving the trial to San Francisco. James Brosnahan, the lead
defense attorney, argued that Alexandria, where the case is being
heard, is home to many military personnel and others who were deeply
hurt by the Sept. 11 attack on the Pentagon, only a few miles from
the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Brosnahan pointed to polls showing that 75% of the respondents in
northern Virginia believed that Lindh is "guilty of something" and
they "feel the punishment should be severe." The defense lawyer noted
the Oklahoma City bombing trials were moved to Denver because of
similar ill feelings.</TE>
<TE>   But Randy Bellows, the lead prosecutor, argued that many of those
killed Sept. 11 aboard the hijacked airplanes were headed home to
California, contradicting defense arguments that Californians were
unaffected by the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Oklahoma City bombing had a "singular and unique impact" on
that city, he said, because the courthouse next door was heavily
damaged in that blast.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis agreed, saying that the Oklahoma City bombing was more of a
"local" event compared with Sept. 11, and he stressed that any
prospective jurors in the Lindh trial have deep feelings about the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Turning aside defense arguments that the case should be heard near
Lindh's family home in the San Francisco area, Ellis said: "There is
no right in American law to be prosecuted where one resides, or used
to reside."</TE>
<TE>   The trial will most likely be underway at the one-year mark of the
Pentagon and World Trade Center attacks, and defense lawyers have
worried that the flood of anniversary stories in the media could turn
the jury against them.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh is charged with conspiracy to commit murder and other
offenses while fighting against the United States in Afghanistan, not
with any role in the Sept. 11 attacks themselves.</TE>
<TE>   But the government contends that Osama bin Laden's organization
trained Lindh to kill Americans.</TE>

<HD>Terror Suspect Calls Himself 'Dedicated Enemy' of U.S.</HD>
<DH>Courts: In unsealed filings, suspected '20th hijacker'
declares his hatred of Jews and Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Accused terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui, in a series of vitriolic court
filings unsealed Monday, declared himself a "slave of Allah" and a
"dedicated enemy of the United States of America" in lashing out at
judges, Jews and his own "death team" of lawyers.</LD>
<LD>   The 15 handwritten filings, unsealed by a federal judge who last
week decided that Moussaoui could defend himself in court, amplify
the virulent sentiments that the French-Moroccan defendant has
revealed in several public court appearances.</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui quoted from the Koran at length in his pleadings,
warning that disbelievers will be cast "into the fire" and that those
who have "turned you out" should be killed. "Life for life, eye for
eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth and wound equal for
equal," he wrote several times in his filings, all of which began "In
the Name of ALLAH."</LD>
<TE>   But even as he condemned the evils of America, Moussaoui declared
his innocence and relied on the U.S. Constitution and its bedrock
principles in making a series of pretrial motions.</TE>
<TE>   Among the previously secret motions filed in the last two months,
Moussaoui argued that his trial should be moved from Alexandria, Va.,
that his defense attorneys should be fired and that he should be set
free immediately. In a May 1 filing, he even demanded that U.S.
District Judge Leonie Brinkema be examined by a court-appointed
psychiatrist and removed from the case.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema had debated whether to release the filings publicly
because of concerns from lawyers in the case about Moussaoui libeling
participants and potentially sending coded messages to terrorists.
But the documents released by the court Monday and posted on the
Internet at www.vaed.uscourts.gov did not appear to have any deleted
portions.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui himself argued in a filing that there was nothing to be
gained by keeping his pleadings out of public view. "Everybody
[knows] that I am a dedicated enemy of the United States of America
(and of course all its good citizens)," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he wrote: "I am indeed a Muslim openly hostile to the Jews
and the United States of America."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities suspect that Moussaoui, the only person charged in the
United States in connection with the Sept. 11 hijackings, was
destined to be the "20th hijacker" had he not been jailed in
Minnesota last August on an immigration violation after his
suspicious activities at a flight school. Although there is little
direct evidence tying him to the 19 hijackers, prosecutors say his
behavior mirrored that of the terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   His trial is set to start in late September, and he faces the
death penalty if convicted on conspiracy and terrorism charges.</TE>
<TE>   The development of Moussaoui representing himself has threatened
to turn his trial into a circus, some of his former defense attorneys
say. And legal and Islamic observers said the new batch of
declarations--with their frequent references to the Koran in
justifying violence and "revenge" killings--threaten to inflame
Muslim relations.</TE>
<TE>   "The Koran itself warns Muslims not to misquote or misuse it,"
said Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Southern California
chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people do not buy into this idea of blaming a religion for
the acts of a few. Most people understand these [quotations] are
taken out of context," he said. "What I'm worried about is the
hatemongers out there who want to take advantage of any such
situation to inflame people about Islam and Muslims, and
unfortunately we see that happening."</TE>
<TE>   In the filings released Monday, Moussaoui appears to have toned
down his violent rhetoric somewhat since the earliest pleadings in
April, focusing more on legal case law and the alleged violation of
his rights to due process in proclaiming his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's latest motion, filed Friday, demanded his immediate
release on the grounds that the FBI and the court system have engaged
in a "conspiracy ... to convict me." He said he did not know any of
the 19 hijackers but that authorities in both the United States and
England have engaged in a years-long conspiracy to keep him under
surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   He argued that the court should throw out several pieces of
evidence against him, including a surveillance tape of a phone
conversation between a Muslim imam and Hussein Ali Hassan Alattas, a
friend of Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   Although authorities would not discuss Alattas' status Monday, he
is believed to be in federal custody as a material witness in the
Sept. 11 probe. He is not thought to have had any direct role in the
hijackings, a government official said.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of Moussaoui's demands have gone unheeded, he did
win the right to act as his own defense attorney at a hearing before
Brinkema on Thursday. Moussaoui said in virtually all of his unsealed
filings that he did not trust his lawyers--referring to them as a
"Blood Sucker Death Team."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui said at last week's hearing that he wanted an unnamed
Muslim attorney to act as "stand-by counsel" in assisting him, but
the judge indicated that the out-of-state attorney might not be able
to practice in Virginia. In an order unsealed Monday, she named a
local attorney, Alan H. Yamamoto, to act as stand-by counsel at least
for the interim.</TE>
<TE>   Yamamoto said he doesn't know whether he'll have any more success
in dealing with his new client than did his predecessors. "I've had
no contact with him at this point, so I have no idea if he'll even
talk to me."</TE>
<TE>   Former defense attorney Edward B. MacMahon, for one, is glad to be
off the case. "I think when you read those pleadings, you can see why
it was that the attorney-client relationship broke down."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MEADVILLE, Miss.--Ronnie Harper was born in Mississippi, graduated
from Ole Miss, and for 10 years now he has served as the district
attorney in this southwest pocket of the state.</LD>
<LD>   But until the letter landed on his desk four years ago, he had
never heard of two young black men named Charlie Moore and Henry Dee
nor the pair of white cousins many believe got away with killing
them.</LD>
<LD>   The letter came from a retired Army sergeant in Colorado. He had
just read about convictions in the notorious 1998 dragging death of a
black man in Jasper, Texas, and wanted to know why no one had been
made to pay for the murder of his younger brother, Charlie, and his
friend nearly 40 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Their deaths were just as savage. Picked up while hitchhiking in
Meadville, the 19-year-old college students were driven to a nearby
national forest, tied to trees and beaten repeatedly with bean
sticks. Still breathing, they were tied to an old Jeep engine block
and pushed into the Old River near Vicksburg.</TE>
<TE>   Harper was astonished that he had never heard of the case. When he
went to the county sheriff's office, he came upon his second
surprise: There were no records of the murders.</TE>
<TE>   It is now an open, active investigation again. Harper convinced
the Mississippi attorney general's office, the state highway patrol
and the FBI to take a fresh look at what he came to realize was one
of his state's cruelest moments.Yet the justice that wasn't delivered
then won't come easy now.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, a handful of white men have been convicted in
slayings of blacks in the 1960s, raising hopes in other long-dormant
civil rights cases. The most recent was last month's conviction of
Bobby Frank Cherry for his role in a Birmingham, Ala., church bombing
that killed four black girls nearly 40 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Across the South, at least 11 such cases, including the killings
of the two young Mississippi men, are in various stages of
review--some driven by eager prosecutors, others by family members or
guilt-ridden witnesses nearing death themselves.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the hope generated by the higher-profile cases, there
are scores of unsolved, race-driven killings of blacks that never
will be resolved, never get a second look--not to mention those that
never got a first look.</TE>
<TE>   And even the relative handful of old cases that are being revived
appear to have slim prospects for successful prosecution. Witnesses
and suspects die, paperwork is lost, evidence is thrown out. And in
the 1960s, the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacy groups often
intimidated sheriffs and prosecutors, preventing competent
investigations and thus dooming efforts to resurrect the cases
decades later.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, "the law is not often well-equipped to redress old
wrongs," said Vanzetta Penn McPherson, a federal magistrate in
Montgomery, Ala., who was a high school sophomore when dynamite
exploded at Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   "The most the law can do is to declare rights," McPherson said.
"But as far as restoring rights, after all these years, it is very
difficult to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Justice in the Old South sometimes depended less on the law than
on the ability of prosecutors to overcome the burden of the times.
Harper's search for justice in Mississippi pits him against the
legacy of a long-ago predecessor, Lenox Forman, who had a partial
confession in hand yet never carried the matter to trial.</TE>
<TE>   Forman was either a coward--as a former police chief calls him--or
a realist who understood that, even with strong evidence, persuading
a jury to convict whites of killing blacks in that racially charged
time was extremely difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Forman evidently had at his disposal a chilling, apparently
eyewitness account of the attack and other details by FBI informants
that leave little doubt about the ugliness of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The two victims had been home from college for a while, working as
laborers. They were last seen May 2, 1964. That summer, parts of
their bodies were found by a fisherman; Moore was identified by the
belt buckle his brother had given him.</TE>
<TE>   Before the year was out, two white men, cousins Charles Marcus
Edwards and James Ford Seale, were arrested, based on a partial
confession by Edwards about what had happened in Homochitto National
Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Forman promised a grand jury investigation, but there is no
evidence that a jury was convened and no indictments were returned,
even after the FBI was tipped that local Ku Klux Klan members were
boasting about the double slaying.</TE>
<TE>   In a secret report, the FBI credits one reliable, confidential
informant who told agents of "the murders of two colored males by the
names of Moore and Dee."</TE>
<TE>   According to the document, Seale "was heard to state" that he and
a friend picked up the young black men in Seale's Volkswagen.</TE>
<TE>   Seale and his friend told the hitchhikers that they were
government revenue agents hunting for bootleg whiskey stills, and
then drove them into the Homochitto forest. A pickup carrying
accomplices followed.</TE>
<TE>   There, Moore and Dee were "tied to a tree and were beaten severely
with bean sticks."</TE>
<TE>   Seale demanded the men tell what they knew about black agitators,
including black Muslims with firearms, who supposedly were heading to
southwest Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Moore and Dee said they knew nothing. But, the report said, "James
Seale and others kept beating the Negroes until one of them finally
said the guns were in a church. And it appeared this had probably
been said by one of the Negroes to stop the beating."</TE>
<TE>   The white men laid down the sticks, wrapped the near-dead black
youths in a piece of plastic tarp and drove toward the Old River.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of days later, some men were bragging at the local Amoco
station that they "had put two niggers in the river," the informant
told the FBI. But they also were worried that the serial number on
the Jeep engine block used to weight the bodies might give them away
if the bodies were recovered.</TE>
<TE>   They were so worried, in fact, that "they had been having
difficulty sleeping at night."</TE>
<TE>   There also was the possibility that the victims had survived.
"Both Negroes were alive when pushed over the side of the boat," one
source told the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Even after their torsos were pulled to the surface, "Seale was
extremely nervous. He was heard making the statement that he himself
had put the tape over the wrists and mouths of both the Negroes and
that he, James Seale, was afraid his fingerprints were still on the
tape or on the underneath side or sticky side of the tape."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards was equally frightened. He told another FBI informant that
he had "a bad case of conscience," was afraid his wife would talk too
much, and that, if anything happened to him, he wanted the Klan to
"raise his kids and support his wife."</TE>
<TE>   But it was not all sweat and worry. At one point, they thought it
amusing enough to tell friends not to "dip water and drink it out of
the river" unless they wanted to be "drinking water off a dead
Negro."</TE>
<TE>   The informants' statements prompted a judge to issue murder
warrants, and Edwards was arrested at 5:30 on a November morning when
Mississippi Highway Patrol investigators, accompanied by FBI agents,
knocked on his door in rural Meadville. Two hours later, at patrol
headquarters in Jackson, Edwards admitted he was acquainted with Dee
but "initially denied" knowing Moore, according to the highway
patrol's report.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Edwards said a group of blacks, including Dee, had been
"peeping" in the windows at his wife. Edwards said he, Seale "and
some others" then went out and picked up Dee and "this other Negro."</TE>
<TE>   "Edwards stated that they took the two men to some woods and
whipped them and that the two Negroes were still alive when he left,"
the report said. "He stated he did not know what happened to them and
declined to identify the others present."</TE>
<TE>   Seale also was arrested. But the investigation stalled when
authorities could not establish who owned the recovered engine block,
and both men were released from jail Jan. 12, 1965--the same day the
FBI report was dated and sent to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Forman formally dismissed the charges in the "interest of
justice." He did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   But a week earlier, Forman told other law enforcement officials
that the case had reached a dead end.</TE>
<TE>   "He did not feel that sufficient evidence exists at this time to
either have a hearing or to present this matter to a grand jury," the
FBI report said. "He expressed the belief that if more evidence could
be developed, to strengthen the case, particularly evidence
implicating other potential defendants, that it would be more
advantageous to present the matter to a grand jury at a later date."</TE>
<TE>   That date never arrived.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forman died in April at age 92. His detractors in Mississippi say
he was afraid to take on the Klan.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't have enough guts," recalled J.T. Robinson, the former
police chief of Natchez, the largest city in Forman's--and now
Harper's--district.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters, however--and there are many--argue that such cases
often were hopeless even with overwhelming physical evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been suggestions before that he soft-pedaled some of
his cases," said U.S. District Judge David C. Bramlette of Biloxi,
who in the 1960s was a defense attorney in this part of the state.</TE>
<TE>   "But he was a fine man. And any attempt to cast aspersions on him
would be misplaced. He was a very ethical, very fine prosecutor."</TE>
<TE>   Forman's son, Rick, a lawyer at the state Capitol in Jackson, said
his father would have dearly loved to prosecute Edwards and Seale.
But, he said, "the Klan was very, very influential." His father often
called home to make sure his mother had locked the doors.</TE>
<TE>   "And it was next to impossible to get them to talk. But my father
never, ever would have purposely dismissed the case. That was not in
his nature, not the way he was."</TE>
<TE>   Harper now confronts the same long odds. Time has not been kind to
a case that much of Mississippi has forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   He is missing witnesses because many are long dead or are so old
they can no longer remember important details.</TE>
<TE>   He is missing police files because local authorities did not save
paperwork or have much of a filing system, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also is missing one of the two key suspects; Seale died last
year. That leaves Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   "You're talking to the wrong man," Edwards said recently, and with
that, quickly ended an interview about his past.</TE>
<TE>   Natchez lawyer William F. Riley, who defended Klan members in the
1960s, said of Edwards: "That boy Charles is a darn nice fella. They
would be wasting their time to indict him. He's well-liked."</TE>
<TE>   As for Seale, his son, James, said: "He was a good man and a good
father. I was a small kid when all that went on.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think they made a mistake, the law did, by arresting them.
And they turned them loose and let them get on with their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Echoing a widely held view here, he added, "Whatever happened in
Mississippi, they ought to let laying dogs lie."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards and Seale flaunted their freedom.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1966, the House Un-American Activities Committee called
both men to Washington, along with many other Klan leaders. They were
summoned to testify in a congressional investigation into illegal
Klan activities, and the lawmakers confronted them with sheriff's
reports identifying them as prime suspects in the double slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters crushed around them and flashbulbs went off. Some of the
Klan members leaned back in the soft-cushioned chairs and smoked
cigars; they seemed to be having a high old time.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards would say only that he lived in Meadville, had completed
the 11th grade and worked at a paper mill. He refused to talk about
his Klan activities or Moore or Dee or his alleged confession, which
was read into the record.</TE>
<TE>   Seale would state only his name and spell it, and say that he had
been served a congressional subpoena at a United Klans of America
rally in Liberty Park in Natchez.</TE>
<TE>   That was nearly four decades ago, and until the letter from
Colorado crossed Harper's desk, all was silent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Moore was in basic training when his brother, Charlie, was
killed. He went on to serve two tours in Vietnam and make a 30-year
career in the Army, retiring as a sergeant major, the highest rank an
enlisted man can attain. Today he counsels troubled youth in his
community in Colorado Springs. He is 58; his brother would have been
57.</TE>
<TE>   "They destroyed my whole family," he said. "Mama never did
recuperate. She lived 13 years from the day she put him in the
cemetery and then left me by myself. Yes, I'm angry. And it's still
going on. I'm still seeing the injustice go on. And I can't stop it."</TE>
<TE>   Some years ago he bought a .30-.30 rifle and seriously thought
about returning to Mississippi to hunt his brother's killers.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to understand that I was a young man there, and the
two of us raised by Mama on welfare," he wrote in the letter to the
Mississippi prosecutor. "Without a dad. He died when I was 2 years
old.</TE>
<TE>   "And when that happened in 1964, I had just got drafted, in April.
I was in basic training. Then they finally found his body and I
wanted Mama to leave Mississippi. I would show them what it was all
about. Finally she had to make me promise that I would let God take
care of this."</TE>
<TE>   Harper will not say much about where the case is headed, or if he
is gaining ground. He said someone might be feeling some guilt out
there, maybe facing their own mortality, and might find the courage
to come forward.</TE>
<TE>   Because part of the assault occurred in a national forest, there
is potential federal jurisdiction too, so a state-federal
investigation is underway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty apparent it was racially motivated," Harper said.
"And there's no statute of limitations on murder. A life--two
lives--should not be taken without anybody paying a price."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Moore continues to wait. But he finds some satisfaction
that Harper has taken up where Lenox Forman left off.</TE>
<TE>   "I've brought it back," he said, "to the doorstep of Mississippi."</TE>

<HD>Solicitor Permits Ruled Unlawful</HD>
<DH>Courts: The free speech right of going door to door trumps
the wish for privacy, justices say.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>City officials cannot require missionaries, politicians and
neighborhood activists to obtain a permit before going door to door
to spread their message, the Supreme Court ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   On an 8-1 vote, the court said the right to free speech trumps the
government's desire to shield the privacy of homeowners, at least
when the solicitors are not selling a product.</LD>
<LD>   ''It is offensive--not only the values protected by the 1st
Amendment, but the very notion of a free society--that in the context
of everyday public discourse a citizen must first inform the
government of her desire to speak to her neighbors and then obtain a
permit to do so,'' Justice John Paul Stevens said for the court. It
would be a ''dramatic departure from our national heritage and
constitutional tradition'' to allow the permit requirement to stand,
he said.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1940s, the Supreme Court struck down a series of ordinances
that were targeted at Jehovah's Witnesses. Some of the measures
barred soliciting entirely. Others imposed a tax on those who wanted
to go door to door.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's ruling goes a step further, saying the permit requirement
itself violates the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling represents another victory for the Jehovah's Witnesses.
Their New York-based lawyers challenged an ordinance adopted by the
tiny village of Stratton, Ohio, population 278.</TE>
<TE>   The case had been closely watched by lawyers for municipalities
around the nation. Concerned that some solicitors may be con artists
or even murderers, they hoped the high court would allow more leeway
to limit solicitors.</TE>
<TE>   In his lone dissent, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist cited the
case of two Dartmouth College professors who were killed by two
teenagers who had gone door to door in Hanover, N.H., claiming to be
taking a survey but apparently intending to steal bank debit cards.
Requiring permits would give residents ''a degree of accountability
and safety'' they would otherwise not have, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In his opinion, Stevens stressed that Stratton's ordinance had to
be struck down because it applied literally to trick-or-treaters on
Halloween, or even neighbors who go next door to ask to borrow an
egg.</TE>
<TE>   He left open the possibility that a permit requirement could stand
if it was limited to commercial solicitors or targeted at stopping
crime or fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The case is the Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society vs. Village of
Stratton, 00-1737.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling shows again that the free speech principle enjoys broad
support on the high court, and it brings together its liberal and
conservative factions.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the justices struck down a federal law that made
''virtual pornography'' a crime, and they earlier voided a federal
measure intended to prohibit pornography. These decisions were
applauded mostly by liberals.</TE>
<TE>   But the justices have also struck down bans on advertising of
products such as cigarettes, beer and casinos, rulings that were
cheered more by conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   One other major free speech case is still pending. It will decide
whether candidates for state judgeships have a right to speak out on
controversial issues that might come before the courts.</TE>

<HD>Lust for Power Cited as Murder Motive</HD>
<DH>Courts: 'He could not let go,' says prosecutor as trial
opens for former Georgia sheriff accused of murdering the man who
defeated him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALBANY, Ga.</DL>
<LD>Sidney Dorsey was a man poisoned by the power he held, prosecutors
said Monday, and when that power was stripped away, he decided to
kill to get it back.</LD>
<LD>   Dorsey, the first black sheriff of DeKalb County, is accused of
assassinating his political rival. As his trial opened, prosecutors
offered a portrait of a man totally out of control--one who allegedly
made deputies run errands for his children, forced a woman to have
sex with him and ran the jailhouse like a medieval fiefdom.</LD>
<LD>   "Power," began prosecutor Kenneth B. Hodges III. "That's what this
case is all about. A man so consumed by power that he could
not--would not--let go."</LD>
<TE>   The murder of Sheriff-Elect Derwin Brown has been the No. 1
mystery in the Atlanta area since he was gunned down in his driveway
on Dec. 15, 2000--three days before he was to take office.</TE>
<TE>   The 46-year-old Brown, who too was black, had defeated Dorsey in a
bitterly contested runoff election. From the earliest hours of the
murder investigation, Dorsey was the prime suspect. If convicted, he
could get life in prison without parole; prosecutors are not seeking
the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey, 62, a former homicide cop with a reputation for being
tough but good, has maintained his innocence. He has not commented
since his November arrest, but said during an earlier interview with
The Times that he feared being set up.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all political. I was the first black sheriff. I opened
business to black firms," Dorsey said. "They wanted to bring me
down."</TE>
<TE>   Who?</TE>
<TE>   "The system."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time Dorsey has been accused of killing
someone; he shot one man in the line of duty in 1965, and another
during a fight at a gas station in 1970. In each case, an
investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to charging Dorsey with Brown's murder, prosecutors
have invoked a rarely used state racketeering law in alleging that
the former sheriff stole public resources, took bribes and forced the
female owner of a bail bond company to have sex with him.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was moved to Albany, three hours south of Atlanta,
because a judge decided pretrial publicity made selecting a fair jury
there impossible.</TE>
<TE>   The state's murder charge rests primarily on the stocky shoulders
of a thug-turned-snitch. Patrick Cuffy confessed to helping kill
Brown and, in exchange for his testimony, received only a year in
jail.</TE>
<TE>   When he takes the witness stand here, the ex-Marine, former
sheriff's deputy and trusted Dorsey protege is expected to recount
how Dorsey ordered the hit--handing him a note on a yellow piece of
paper saying: "Kill Derwin Brown." Dorsey planned to become sheriff
again once Brown was out of the way, Cuffy has said.</TE>
<TE>   But during the March trial of two accused accomplices, Cuffy's
testimony fell flat. It took jurors just four hours to acquit Melvin
Walker and alleged triggerman David Ramsey; members of the jury later
said they didn't trust Cuffy.</TE>
<TE>   The current trial involves many of the same witnesses and
evidence. It is expected to last a month.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of another acquittal terrifies Brown's family, who
sat grim-faced in the front row of the courtroom Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Just coming through the door makes my heart skip," said his
mother, Burvena Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know they were allowed to lie in there," seethed Phyllis
Brown, his widow, as she stood on the courthouse steps during a
break.</TE>
<TE>   She was referring to the opening defense statement, which sketched
Dorsey's life--starting with a 1945 train ride that relocated a poor
boy from New York City to Decatur, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   From there, it was hard work--cleaning toilets for school fees,
joining the Army, putting himself through college and law school
while a cop--that propelled Dorsey to the peak of the law enforcement
pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, defense attorney Brian Steel conceded, there might have been
some excesses along the way. "Like most politicians, Sidney Dorsey
rewarded people who had worked on his campaign," Steel said.</TE>
<TE>   As for allegations that Dorsey made on-duty sheriff's deputies
take his son to Toys "R" Us and drive the family to Disney World,
Steel said: "Though it seems distasteful, you will learn it is legal.
To be sheriff is to be sheriff 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And
the employees work for you."</TE>
<TE>   After opening statements, the prosecution called its first
witnesses--a medical expert who testified about Brown's bullet
wounds, then the current sheriff, who began to detail some of the
abuses he had discovered in the department when he took office.</TE>
<TE>   As sheriff of DeKalb County, Dorsey was in charge of jail
operations. The position traditionally enjoys wide discretion in
awarding contracts, and that autonomy has spelled trouble in the
past. Every DeKalb sheriff since 1964 has been investigated, indicted
or imprisoned before his term ended.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey was elected in 1996, and Brown ousted him in August 2000.
Brown, also a career cop, had run on a campaign promise to clean up
the department and illuminate past abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "And he paid for it with his own blood," said his sister Renee.</TE>

<HD>Mystery of Deep Throat Lives Despite Buildup</HD>
<DH>Watergate: Nixon aide John Dean said he would identify the
elusive news source 30 years after the break-in, but he could only
narrow the field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Thirty years after the Watergate break-in, the identity of Deep
Throat--the White House insider who helped bring down President
Richard Nixon--remains a mystery.</LD>
<LD>   Although former White House counsel John Dean has spent 25 of
those years trying to unmask the man who was a source for Washington
Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, he failed Monday to
identify Deep Throat in a 158-page e-book published by Salon, an
online daily magazine.</LD>
<LD>   Deep Throat--whose identity has been carefully protected by the
reporters, as well as by former Post executive editor Benjamin
Bradlee--was a key character in the best-selling book and movie "All
the President's Men." Yet little about him is known, except that he
had access to high-level information and met with Woodward in garages
and other remote locations from 1972 to '73, offering damning
insights into Nixon.</LD>
<TE>   In the concluding chapter of "Unmasking Deep Throat: History's
Most Elusive News Source," Dean offered four possibilities from the
Nixon White House: speech writer Patrick J. Buchanan, press secretary
Ronald Ziegler and aides Ray Price and Steven Bull. But he said more
research is needed for a final identification.</TE>
<TE>   "We are closer than we ever have been," Dean wrote, "and clearly
within striking range."</TE>
<TE>   His e-book, however, failed to live up to its billing. As the 30th
anniversary of the White House-sponsored break-in at the Democratic
National Committee headquarters approached, Dean was said to be on
the verge of an identification. Yet several candidates issued
persuasive denials, causing him to stop short of naming any one
person.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Woodward and Bernstein have kept mum. They and
Bradlee have said they will not identify Deep Throat without his
permission while he is alive. But they have said, many times, that
their source was a real person--not a composite--and that he offered
crucial information for their reporting.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Dean's theories, Woodward told NBC's "Meet the Press"
on Sunday: "You're going to get a kind of deep silence from us on
this subject."</TE>
<TE>   Dean has conceded that he has a personal interest in revealing
Deep Throat's identity. The former White House aide, who suspected
that he was being set up by Nixon's White House team to take the
blame for the Watergate cover-up, testified against his ex-boss in
dramatic 1973 hearings. He told Nixon there was a "cancer" on the
presidency that had to be rooted out, and his testimony paved the way
for the president's resignation in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd truly like to chat with, and tip my hat to, the one person
who will go into history outranking me on Richard Nixon's final
enemies list," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Gathering Clues</TE>
<TE>   In winnowing his list, Dean said, he carefully screened "All the
President's Men" for clues, in addition to examining several
statements made over the years by Bradlee.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the tidbits gleaned, Dean concluded that Deep Throat was
a well-read but occasionally rowdy man who drank scotch, smoked
constantly, had a heavy 5 o'clock shadow and was either a bachelor or
trapped in an unhappy marriage. He deduced the latter from the fact
that Woodward met with Deep Throat in the middle of the night and
that this would have been uncharacteristic behavior for a happily
married man.</TE>
<TE>   Dean checked Deep Throat candidates against these and other
traits. He also documented their comings and goings from 1972 to 1974
to see if they could have met with Woodward on the dates mentioned in
the book.</TE>
<TE>   An elite list of well-known personalities was thus eliminated,
including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, White House
aides Diane Sawyer and Alexander Haig, and former FBI Director L.
Patrick Gray. Dean has promised to continue issuing updates on his
research until the mystery is solved.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear, however, whether a majority of Americans care.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Watergate scandal profoundly altered history, nearly
two-thirds of the respondents in a new ABC poll said they didn't know
enough about the break-in and cover-up to tell the basic facts to
another person.</TE>

<HD>Kennedy's Second-Best Against Lefties</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troy Glaus and Adam Kennedy each were selected among the top 20 picks
in the 1997 draft. Glaus arrived in the major leagues one year later,
Kennedy two years later, and both were expected to enjoy long and
prosperous careers.</LD>
<LD>   So far, so good for Glaus, already a two-time All-Star third
baseman. But Kennedy, proclaimed by the Angels as their second
baseman for the next decade when they acquired him from the Cardinals
two years ago, returns to St. Louis today without an everyday job.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy played every day two years ago, hitting .266 in his rookie
season. He hit .270 last year and is hitting .292 this year, and his
defense is much improved. But, during the second half last season and
again this season, Manager Mike Scioscia has typically used Benji Gil
or Jose Nieves at second base against left-handers. The Angels have
faced 19 left-handed starters this season; Kennedy has started three
times.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know if he just didn't have anybody else to play second
base my first year, or whether he's lost confidence in me the last
couple of years to play every day," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia insisted he has confidence in Kennedy, pointing out his
532 plate appearances last season were "in the everyday mold" and
that matchups can favor Gil or Nieves, allowing the Angels to get
another right-handed bat in the lineup against left-handers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not a reflection on Adam's ability at all," Scioscia said.
"I think Adam can hit lefties. As his offensive potential emerges,
he'll match up well with any pitcher."</TE>
<TE>   With infield prospect Alfredo Amezaga nearly ready for the majors,
Kennedy might have to leave the Angels to play every day, which would
leave the team with nothing to show for the trade that sent Jim
Edmonds to the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   That would be a cruel blow to Angel fans already wondering how
potent this year's lineup could be with Edmonds in center, Darin
Erstad playing first base, and Gil, Nieves and/or Scott Spiezio
playing second base and batting ninth. Three years ago, the Angels
had signed Spiezio to play second, before trading for Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a doubt, I plan on being an everyday player," Kennedy
said. "I would love for it to be here."</TE>

<LD>Shawn Estes and Mike Piazza hit Roger Clemens all right
Saturday--with longballs instead of beanballs.</LD>
<LD>   But after learning that ESPN baseball analyst Rob Dibble
questioned Estes' toughness and called him a "clown" on Baseball
Tonight, the Mets struck back.</LD>
<LD>   "He was the most unprofessional player to ever play, or one of
them," Met Manager Bobby Valentine told the New York Daily News.
"When he hit people it was because they hit a home run off him, not
protection for his teammates."</LD>
<TE>   Dibble, a relief pitcher for seven seasons in the major leagues
said Estes should have hit Clemens, even after he missed and both
benchings were warned, and that the left-hander probably lost the
support of his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Daily News, not one Met agreed with Dibble that
Estes had lost respect or support in the clubhouse, whether they were
asked on or off the record.</TE>

<HD>Brazil Wakes Up in Time Against Belgium</HD>
<DH>Round of 16: Rivaldo and Ronaldo score second-half goals in
a 2-0 victory that leads to matchup with England.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KOBE, Japan</DL>
<LD>Four-time champion Brazil withstood a stubborn Belgium team Monday
for a 2-0 victory to reach the World Cup quarterfinals on Rivaldo's
67th-minute goal and Ronaldo's clincher in the 87th.</LD>
<LD>   Brazil, the only Latin American team left in the World Cup, faces
England on Friday in Shizuoka, Japan. Spain, England, Senegal,
Germany and the United States had already reached the quarterfinals
with the last two spots decided today.</LD>
<LD>   Like Brazil, Rivaldo was shut down for much of the match. But in
the 67th minute he scored a goal worthy of the World Cup stage.</LD>
<TE>   Taking a long pass off the right wing from Ronaldinho, Rivaldo
settled the ball with his chest, touched it with his left foot, spun
to face the goal, let it bounce once, and ripped an 18-yard
half-volley that deflected slightly off Belgian midfielder Timmy
Simons and rocketed home past goalkeeper Geert De Vlieger.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the hardest match of the Cup for Brazil," Rivaldo said.
"Thank God we scored first, because if we had gotten behind it would
have been difficult."</TE>
<TE>   With Rivaldo having scored his fourth of the tournament, Ronaldo
scored his fifth 20 minutes later, taking a pass from Kleberson from
the wing on a counterattack and scoring from 10 yards.</TE>
<TE>   With the victory, Brazilian fans unfurled a sign that read:
"England Here We Come--God Help The Queen."</TE>
<TE>   Brazil, the favorite to win its fifth title with Spain the No. 2
choice, seems to be peaking at the right time.</TE>
<TE>   "The World Cup actually begins now," Ronaldo said. "From now on
every match will be a final, like today's. Today it was wonderful,
the support from the crowd, seeing that huge yellow-green mass in the
stands."</TE>
<TE>   Belgium, which had more than its share of chances, seemed to have
gone ahead in the 36th when Marc Wilmots headed a cross from eight
yards behind Brazil goalkeeper Marcos. But Jamaican referee Peter
Prendergast disallowed the goal, ruling the Belgian had impeded
Brazilian defender Roque Junior.</TE>
<TE>   "We played a great match but made one mistake in defense that
preceded the first goal," said midfielder Bart Goor.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the disallowed goal, he said: "It was a great goal.
I'm not sure whether that was a foul "</TE>
<TE>   Said Wilmots, who is retiring from the national team: "There was a
referee, a decision. It was human."</TE>
<TE>   Not content to stay back and defend, Belgium came out attacking.</TE>
<TE>   After only 37 seconds, striker Mbo Mpenza looped an 18-yard shot
that Marcos had to leap high to deflect over the bar.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Like death and taxes, Tiger Woods holding the lead in the U.S. Open
is one of life's certainties, writes Greg Cote of the Miami Herald:</LD>
<LD>   "Tiger with a four-shot cushion entering the final round of a
major? That's not money in the bank. That is the bank.</LD>
<LD>   "That's Randy Johnson with an 0-2 count against a guy in a
blindfold. That's Barry Bonds, swinging at Little League fences. A
Williams sister, with a dozen match points. Michael Johnson, with a
head start.</LD>
<TE>   "That's Shaq. Only bigger."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What major leaguer hit the most home runs in a season
in which he won the batting title?</TE>
<TE>   No mas: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle, on golfer
Sergio Garcia's habit of endlessly re-gripping his club before a
shot:</TE>
<TE>   "Good Lord, Garcia, get a grip! You're like a baseball pitcher
throwing to first base 12 times before every pitch. And there's no
runner on base."</TE>
<TE>   A long way: Eight years ago, Kurt Warner was stocking shelves in a
Hy-Vee supermarket. Last weekend, the St. Louis Ram quarterback was
one of the celebrities playing in a golf tournament sponsored by the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Warner recalled that he used to live about a mile from the
Hyperion Field Club in Johnston, Iowa, where he arrived in a black
stretch limousine.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't let me on the course back then," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion police: Ryan Clark of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, on
the colorful jackets some Lakers wore after they clinched the NBA
title:</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, dear fan, for only $1,800, you too can purchase your very
own three-peat leather jacket. Made from Italian lambskin and lined
in satin, the jacket can transform any average accountant into an NBA
superstar.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, maybe not, but you and Kobe will have at least one thing in
common."</TE>
<TE>   Rocket launcher: New York Yankee Roger Clemens, who had a pitch
thrown behind him while at bat Saturday against the New York Mets'
Shawn Estes, has hit batters 132 times with pitches but has never
been hit himself.</TE>
<TE>   Good humor man: During a high-profile murder trial, San Diego
Superior Court Judge William Mudd, in an attempt to break the
tension, has repeatedly joked about the Padres' poor play this
season.</TE>
<TE>   But jurors are showing their team loyalty. Two have taken to
wearing Padre shirts to the trial.</TE>
<TE>   And team management has sent the judge some Padre trinkets and a
note: "We're glad you're able to create some humor at our expense."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Mickey Mantle with 52 in 1956, the same season he
batted .353 and drove in 130 runs to win the triple crown.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The United States' 2-0 victory over Mexico in the
World Cup elicited a history reference from Marcos Breton of the
Sacramento Bee:</TE>
<TE>   "It was like the Alamo all over again, only this time the
Americans won. Only this time it was televised. Only this time,
instead of Mexicans and Americans killing each other, they played
World Cup soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "And across Sacramento, they drank and watched together. When it
was done, the Americans enjoyed their beers, while Mexicans cried in
them."</TE>

<AU>PAUL CALIGIURI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Caligiuri, whose decisive goal against Trinidad and Tobago in
1989 propelled the United States into the World Cup for the first
time in 40 years, started every game for the U.S. in the 1990 and '94
World Cups. He made 110 appearances for the U.S. during his
international career. He played six seasons in the MLS, the last five
with the Galaxy, before retiring after last season to coach the men's
and women's soccer teams at Cal Poly Pomona.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Games between Mexico and the United States might not always bring
out the highest quality soccer, but few national rivalries in the
sport compare in terms of the intensity that players from both sides
bring to the field. Each game is a war, not only of soccer but also
egos. Personal and national pride are on the line. The players are
familiar with each other, and in many cases there are friendships.</LD>
<TE>   Until the games begin.</TE>
<TE>   In that regard, Monday's game was typical. But the tension was
multiplied because the venue was the World Cup finals.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. won this time because of coaching, not necessarily
because Mexico's Javier Aguirre made mistakes, but because the United
States' Bruce Arena didn't. The U.S. players have bought into Arena's
system. While many coaches find a certain comfort point and refuse to
budge from it, he has shown that he has no problem making changes to
ensure the best matchups. He is not afraid to utilize the
unprecedented depth he has. Nineteen players have played in four
games.</TE>
<TE>   Going from four defenders to three against the United States'
archrival was a gutsy move that proved brilliant. He overloaded the
midfield to counter the heart and strength of the Mexican team, which
had played extremely well, particularly against Croatia and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy crowded the space around the U.S. goal, forcing the
Mexicans to attack wide, where they are less effective. John O'Brien,
the American who plays for Ajax in Amsterdam, has been everything we
expected him to be. The huge surprise has been the relentless defense
and smart ball distribution of Pablo Mastroeni. This was supposed to
be a glaring weakness after the injury to Chris Armas.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Sanneh is playing the best soccer of his career. Not only did
he shut down Portugal's Luis Figo, rated the world's best player by
FIFA, Sanneh also is moving forward into the attack and sending
pinpoint passes to the head of Brian McBride.</TE>
<TE>   After the lack of firepower demonstrated in France four years ago,
the U.S. has shown that it knows how to put the ball into the back of
the net with flair and style. Just when Mexico had the run of play,
the U.S. took the game in hand with a lethal strike by Landon
Donovan.</TE>
<TE>   The ability to absorb pressure from the other team and counter
quickly and accurately is becoming a hallmark of the team. There are
times when the U.S. knocks it around and holds the ball well, but the
players are not consistent. Their style is more opportunistic. It is
a quick, unpredictable and dangerous attack that comes from a variety
of combinations.</TE>
<TE>   When the U.S. does not control the ball, which seems to be most of
the time, it forces the midfielders to run more and puts tremendous
pressure on the defenders and the goalkeeper. They were up to the
challenge against Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   If there was a big question about the U.S. lineup, it was who
would start in goal. An injury to Kasey Keller before the first game
made things easier for Arena. The solid play of Brad Friedel has
become the team's foundation. Even though he was far from technically
perfect against Mexico, he accomplished his most important
task--keeping the ball out of the net.</TE>
<TE>   Against Germany, Arena will have to plan a totally different game
tactically. The three-time world champions emphasize their attack
down the wings, sending the ball into Miroslav Klose, who has five
goals in this World Cup on headers.</TE>
<TE>   So can we anticipate another magical adjustment to the lineup from
Arena?</TE>
<TE>   And can we anticipate that many Mexican-Americans will cheer for
the U.S.?</TE>
<TE>   They might be surprised again. This U.S. team fears no one and has
a better chance than most people give them to advance to the
semifinals.</TE>

<LD>England's success at the World Cup has Prime Minister Tony Blair
planning to juggle meetings at a European summit so he watch the
team's quarterfinal match Friday against Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   A leading British bookmaker, meanwhile, is slashing odds that
England captain David Beckham will receive a knighthood within a
year.</LD>
<LD>   Madame Tussaud's has canceled plans to feature Beckham's wax
likeness in Trafalgar Square--but only because his replica is too
popular back at the museum.</LD>
<TE>   Blair said he hopes to rearrange his schedule Friday at the
European Council meeting in Seville, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to say unfortunately I have to attend an international
conference and so I'm desperately trying to scramble around looking
for how I can refix the time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bookies William Hill were also scrambling to slash the odds on
whether Beckham will become Sir David within a year from 50-1 to
20-1. Hills said they have also taken bets on whether Brooklyn
Beckham, Beckham's 3-year-old son, will grow up playing soccer for
England and have cut the odds from 500-1 to 50-1.</TE>

<LD>Brazilians started the week off on the right foot Monday morning
celebrating their 2-0 World Cup win over Belgium as if it was

<LD>   But there still were those who weren't convinced the Brazilians
will defeat England, their quarterfinal opponent, if they don't
improve.</LD>
<LD>   "My God what a hard game. For a while I thought we would lose. Our
defense was terrible and we let them move all over the place," said
Maria Neide dos Santos, a housekeeper.</LD>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Blue Jays Should Be Green</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The teams have never met in a series before, but it can be said the
Dodgers are 2-0 against the Toronto Blue Jays in recent trades
between the clubs.</LD>
<LD>   Right fielder Shawn Green, the centerpiece of a four-player trade
with Toronto in November 1999, is the Dodgers' most productive
hitter, while former Dodger right fielder Raul Mondesi continues to
put up solid but unspectacular numbers for the Blue Jays.</LD>
<LD>   Green is batting .289 with 20 home runs and 52 runs batted in
after a record-setting home run season last year. Mondesi is batting
.218 with 14 homers and 41 RBIs, which puts him on pace to equal or
surpass his production of the last two seasons.</LD>
<TE>   The other players involved in the trade, pitcher Pedro Borbon, who
was sent to Toronto, and infielder Jorge Nunez, who went to the
Dodgers, have since been traded to other teams.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage: Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also picked up shortstop Cesar Izturis and reliever
Paul Quantrill last December in another four-player trade with
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Izturis, 22, is batting .250 with 17 RBIs and has made only five
errors. Quantrill, 0-2 with a 3.82 earned-run average, has been solid
in a setup role.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays received pitchers Luke Prokopec and Chad Ricketts,
neither of whom has made an impact at the major league level.</TE>
<TE>   Prokopec, who had a solid season with the Dodgers in 2001, is 2-7
with a 5.86 ERA in 12 starts. Ricketts has spent the season with the
Syracuse SkyChiefs, Toronto's triple-A affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage: Dodgers. "We got a good shortstop, a shortstop you have
to think will be around for several years to come if you continue to
see him play at the pace, with the focus and the effort that he plays
the game everyday," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "He's something
that Los Angeles hasn't seen on a day in and day out basis for a
while."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Green, who spent his first five full major league seasons with the
Blue Jays, is thrilled to play his former team for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited to see some of my good friends there," he said. "At
the same time, I'm happy the team has changed personnel a lot since
I've been there. It would be more difficult to play a team filled
with guys that I played with. Now there's just a few."</TE>
<TE>   Green is especially close to first baseman Carlos Delgado, who was
a member of his wedding party. Izturis said he is looking forward to
being reunited with pitcher Kelvim Escobar in addition to Delgado and
Mondesi.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the guys who helped me a lot last year," said Izturis,
who hit .269 in 46 games during his rookie season. "It's going to be
great to see them."</TE>
<TE>   Green said he is disappointed that his former organization has
dropped out of contention only 2 1/2 months into the season.</TE>
<TE>   "They're basically in more of a rebuilding mode," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   "They dumped a lot of salary. It's tough to see because in '98,
'99 and 2000, the team was so close and was one piece away. Now it's
got a little ways to go to get back to those situations."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said he couldn't ask for anything more than the Dodgers have
given this season. At 41-27, they are 14 games over .500 and trail
the Arizona Diamondbacks by one game in the National League West.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' early play has been especially impressive, Tracy
said, considering the questions that hounded the team coming out of
spring training. Dave Roberts has proven to be a solid leadoff man,
Izturis has provided steady play at shortstop and the starting
rotation has survived an injury to Kevin Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy went so far as to say the Dodgers might be able to get by
without Brown, who remains sidelined indefinitely by elbow and back
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not taking anything away from Kevin Brown," Tracy said.
"We're a lot better with him. But, you know what? I felt like the
strength of this team coming out of spring training was our pitching
staff and the depth of it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had asked me [whether the Dodgers could get by without
Brown] last year, I would have told you no."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Will Sign Russia's Chistov</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Center Stanislav Chistov, the Mighty Ducks' No. 1 draft pick in 2001,
has left Russia and will sign with the team after nearly a year of
road blocks and intrigue, a hockey source said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Chistov, the fifth player selected in the draft, and forward
Alexander Svitov, who Tampa Bay selected third overall, remained in
Russia the last year as officials from Avangard Omsk, their club
team, fought to keep them.</LD>
<LD>   Svitov was in Tampa, Fla., on Monday when Lightning officials
announced he would be able to honor the three-year contract he signed
last summer. Chistov is expected to sign this week.</LD>
<TE>   Duck officials said they would announce a signing today, but would
not reveal the name.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov, 19, is an exceptional playmaker and scorer, although
there are some concerns about his size, 5 feet 10 and 178 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov helped Russia's junior national team win the 2001 World
Championship by scoring four goals in the tournament. He was most
valuable player of the championship game, a 5-4 victory over Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov will need time to mature and adjust to the NHL's more
physical style, but his addition is a step in the right direction for
the Ducks, who scored the second-fewest points in the league last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Duck and Lightning officials have been frustrated since July, when
Omsk President Anatoliy Bardin claimed Chistov and Svitov had been
inducted into the Russian army in December, 2000. Under the NHL's
deal with the International Ice Hockey Federation, compulsory
military service is the only thing that prevents an NHL team from
signing a drafted player.</TE>
<TE>   "I was called a deserter," Chistov told Soviet Sport in December.
"I was sent to the sports regiment [of the Airborne forces]. My
service there continued for 11 days, during which I practically did
not do a thing, though I did wear army boots."</TE>
<TE>   Chistov and Svitov were to serve two years in the army, but agent
Jay Grossman recently secured their release.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey's Andrei Zyuzin and Tampa Bay's Nikita Alexeev, bought
their release from the army for about $50,000 each, hockey sources
said. Svitov told the St. Petersburg Times that no financial
arrangements were made for him or Chistov.</TE>

<KH>FIRST LOOK/ UNITED STATES VS. GERMANY</KH>
<HD>German Media Are Yawning</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>JEONJU, South Korea</DL>
<LD>The United States will meet Germany in a World Cup quarterfinal
Friday at Ulsan, a prospect that excites Americans considerably more
than Germans.</LD>
<LD>   In Germany, where World Cup quarterfinal appearances are regarded
a birth right, qualification for final eight in 2002 was greeted by
little enthusiasm from the media.</LD>
<LD>   "Germany totters into the quarterfinals," was the headline
Munich's Sueddeutsche Zeitung ran after Germany's lackluster 1-0
victory over Paraguay in the second round.</LD>
<TE>   The soccer magazine Kicker described Germany's triumph as
"fortunate but not undeserved.... The German team lacked someone with
ideas in midfield. The only one with any creativity was Bernd
Schneider, but even he couldn't give [Coach Rudi] Voller's men any
direction."</TE>
<TE>   And the Munich magazine Focus dismissed Germany and Paraguay as
"two technically limited teams" and chided Germany for its "big
failing--not being able to control a match."</TE>
<TE>   After scoring eight goals against Saudi Arabia, tying Ireland and
frustrating a talented Cameroon squad with defense and quick
counterattacks, Germany backslid against Paraguay--missing several
scoring opportunities and seemingly headed for overtime at 0-0 before
Oliver Neuville's 88th-minute strike spared Germany the virtual
certainty of a penalty shootout.</TE>
<TE>   Unsightly as it was, the victory over Paraguay clinched Germany a
spot in the quarterfinals for the 11th time in 12 World Cups--dating
to 1954, which culminated in the first of Germany's three World Cup
titles.</TE>
<TE>   Voller, a high-scoring forward on the 1990 champion, believes that
record ought to count for something, prompting him to lash out at the
"over-the-top" German media.</TE>
<TE>   "What has been written, in particular in the international press,
was not always fair," Voller said. "The expectations we had coming
here and the fact that we had three players suspended should have
been taken into consideration."</TE>
<TE>   Germany played Paraguay without defender Carsten Ramelow and
midfielders Dietmar Hamann and Christian Ziege, all forced to sit out
because of suspensions.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't realign things at the drop of a hat when you're without
three players," Voller said.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has advanced with its customary assets: methodically
attentive defense, a quality goalkeeper in Oliver Kahn and a
slashing, go-to striker, Miroslav Klose, who is tied with Brazil's
Ronaldo with five goals to lead all scorers in this tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to be extremely careful not to be knocked out like we
were in 1994 and 1998," Kahn said, referring to Germany's
quarterfinal defeats in the last two World Cups.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Voller went out of his way to praise the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   "No one expected the USA to get this far, and they're really on a
roll," Voller said. "Their confidence is going to be high."</TE>
<TE>   Up to a point. U.S. Coach Bruce Arena said that Germany "will be
an overwhelming favorite" against his team at Ulsan.</TE>
<TE>   "And they should beat us, by the way," he said. "They're supposed
to beat us. We're going to go out and have a little fun."</TE>

<HD>Williams Is Something Special</HD>
<DH>Award: Already the only four-time NCAA 100-meter winner,
the USC star becomes fourth track and field star to win
Honda-Broderick Cup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>When it comes time for the 2004 Athens Olympics, you'll likely hear
plenty about Marion Jones, the established U.S. women's sprint star.
Chances are, you'll also hear a lot about Angela Williams. In the
same races.</LD>
<LD>   The recognition is beginning to pile up for Williams, one of the
most decorated track and field performers in the history of USC.</LD>
<LD>   Monday night, she won the prestigious women's collegiate athlete
of the year award at a dinner here that, for the 26th consecutive
year, celebrated women's college sports with the awarding of the
Honda-Broderick Cup to the best of its best.</LD>
<TE>   Williams put herself alone on a track and field pedestal recently
by becoming the only athlete, male or female, to win four consecutive
100-meter races in the NCAA championship meet. By winning the cup,
she joined the prestigious ranks of Jackie Joyner, Mia Hamm, Ann
Meyers, Nancy Lieberman, Cheryl Miller, Mary T. Meagher and Tracy
Caulkins, among others. The only other track and field competitors to
take the cup have been Vicki Huber of Villanova in 1989, Suzy Favor
of Wisconsin in 1990 and Joyner of UCLA in '85.</TE>
<TE>   A shaken Williams, clearly surprised by the announcement, took a
moment to wipe away some tears before speaking to the dinner crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I am truly blessed and honored by this," she said. "To see video
of all the other athletes here, and to see all they have achieved,
was amazing. And then to win ... "</TE>
<TE>   The list of athletes that Williams beat out for the award, each
selected by voting from NCAA member schools, included Bea Bielek of
Wake Forest in tennis, Sue Bird of Connecticut in basketball, Tara
Chaplin of Arizona in cross-country, Natalie Coughlin of California
in swimming, Erin Elbe of Georgetown in lacrosse, Jeannie Finch of
Arizona in softball, Virada Nirapathpongporn of Duke in golf, Andres
Pickens of Alabama in gymnastics, Logan Tom of Stanford in
volleyball, Aly Wagner of Santa Clara in soccer and Autumn Welsh of
Maryland in field hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Bird was not eligible for consideration in the final voting
because her WNBA team, the Seattle Storm, would not allow her to miss
a Monday practice session to fly here. The Storm plays the Sparks
tonight in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The Division II player of the year was track athlete Nicole Duncan
of Cal State L.A. and the Division III winner was lacrosse player
Julia Bergofsky of Middlebury, Vt., College.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, also named the women's track and field athlete of the
year by the U.S. Track Coaches Assn., June 5, is from Ontario and was
a star at Chino High, where she became the first prep female runner
to go under 11 seconds in the 100 meters, when she clocked a
wind-aided 10.98 as a junior in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Her best 100 time, unaided by wind, is still the 11.04 she did as
a USC freshman, and she turned an 11.06 at the Mt. SAC Relays in
April, which remains among a handful of top times in the world this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had chosen to come to Dallas a day later than most of the
other honorees so she could remain home in Ontario with her father,
Johnny, on Father's Day.</TE>
<TE>   "We just hung out, went to church and to a movie," she said. "It
was his day. I wanted to be with him."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Love, senior associate athletic director at USC, represented
USC at the dinner, which runs in conjunction with the national
college athletic directors convention. About Williams she said, "She
always has had a great perspective about competition, kind of a
joyful exuberance about running. It took that sort of approach to win
four NCAA 100s."</TE>
<TE>   Love said she had the sense, as far back as when she met her as a
high school recruit, that Williams would be special.</TE>
<TE>   "She was one of those 17-year-olds who can look you in the eye,"
Love said. "She has always had kind of a subtle wisdom about her."</TE>
<TE>   Up next for Williams is a summer of international competition she
hopes will propel her toward 2004 Olympic success. Her previous
Olympic experiences have not been memorable. She tore a hamstring
trying to make the 1996 Olympic team and came down with flu when it
came time to compete for a spot on the 2000 team in Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   "Athens is out there," she said "It's where I hope I'm headed,
just step by step, day by day."</TE>
<TE>   USC's only other Honda-Broderick Cup winner was Miller in 1984.</TE>

<TE>   USC Sprint Sensation</TE>
<TE>   A closer look at Angela Williams' career highlights:</TE>
<TE>   Four-time 100 champion: Williams beat teammate Natasha Mayers by
0.01 seconds to become the first person to win four consecutive NCAA
titles in the 100 meters (11.29 seconds) at the NCAA championships at
Baton Rouge, La.</TE>
<TE>   Third-place finish: After leading USC to an NCAA title as a
junior, Williams and the Trojans settled for third place at the
championships behind South Carolina and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Super prep: Williams' wind-aided 10.98 100 as a junior at Chino
High was the first sub-11 second clocking for a high school girl.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic hopeful: A torn hamstring ended her chances of making the
1996 U.S. Olympic team, and flu prevented her from competing in 2000.
She finished third in the 100 at last year's U.S. championships but
was eliminated in the semifinals of the 100 at the world
championships.</TE>
<TE>   Quotable: "In terms of what she's brought to the program, you get
an Angela Williams probably once in a coaching career. Certainly,
she's the greatest sprinter in the history of women's track and field
at USC, and maybe one of the better sprinters ever, in terms of her
accomplishments, whether male or female, collegiately.''--Ron Allice,
USC's director of track and field</TE>

<LD>   What: ":03 From Gold"</LD>
<TE>   Where: HBO, tonight, 10</TE>
<TE>   Less than 48 hours after one of the brightest moments in the
history of U.S. international sports competition--the victory over
Mexico in the World Cup--HBO examines one of the darkest moments--the
controversial loss to the Soviet Union in the gold-medal basketball
game at the 1972 Summer Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't planned that way. The documentary commemorating the 30th
anniversary of the historic game was to be shown at this time in
order to avoid conflicts with first-run prime-time programming in
September.</TE>
<TE>   This excellent one-hour documentary was co-produced by Black
Canyon Productions and HBO, which have teamed up on a number of
award-winning documentaries over the last 10 years. The story of what
happened on Sept. 9, 1972, at Munich, is told completely, thoroughly
and objectively.</TE>
<TE>   The game took place four days after the terrorist attack on the
Olympic village that resulted in the deaths of 11 Israelis. The U.S.
went into the game with a 55-game Olympic winning streak, and it
appeared the Americans had won their eighth consecutive gold medal
after Doug Collins made two free throws with three seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   The Soviet Union failed to get a shot off, and the U.S.
celebrated. But R. William Jones, secretary general of the
International Basketball Federation, came on the floor and dictated
that three seconds be put back on the clock because the Soviet Union
had called timeout.</TE>
<TE>   The horn sounded again, but again three seconds were put back on
the clock because of a malfunction with the scoreboard clock.</TE>
<TE>   The third time was the charm for the Soviet Union, as Ivan Edeshko
threw a full-court pass to Aleksandr Belov, who scored a layup for a
51-50 victory.</TE>

<HD>Cashion Enjoys the Time of Her Life</HD>
<DH>Irvine sophomore not only breaks 50 seconds but earns
second-fastest 100 freestyle in history</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Courtney Cashion touched the wall at the end of the 100-yard
freestyle last month at the Southern Section Division I swimming
finals, then looked up at the digital clock inside Belmont Plaza in
Long Beach. The Irvine High sophomore was hoping to break 50 seconds
for the first time, but was shocked to see 49.45 flash across the
board.</LD>
<LD>   She quickly lifted her goggles, wiped the beads of water from her
face, then shot another look at the numbers.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't think [the clock] was right," Cashion said. "I didn't
know how I did that."</LD>
<TE>   Cashion's time was the second-fastest all-time mark for a high
school meet. Christina Swindle of Gulliver Prep High in Florida went
49.39 earlier this season, breaking the national high school record
of 49.61.</TE>
<TE>   Cashion, The Times' girls' swimmer of the year, wasn't the only
one in awe of her performance at the division finals on May 10.</TE>
<TE>   Many who watched her sweep the 50 and 100 freestyles, as well as
anchor Irvine's 200 medley relay team to a national high school
record, were impressed with Cashion's speed and determination.</TE>
<TE>   "She really came down this year," Irvine Coach Scott Hinman said
of Cashion's times. "It was a lot of hard work, a lot of mental
maturity and being confident."</TE>
<TE>   Cashion's best time in the 100 freestyle a year ago was 50.22,
good enough to win the Division I title. Her winning time last month
in the 50 freestyle, 23.22, was .35 faster than her best time last
year, in the finals, where she finished second in Division I.</TE>
<TE>   Cashion credited her teammates at Irvine High and in the Irvine
Novaquatics swim club for giving her the will to train hard after
knee surgery 18 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   She said she's equally proud of the teamwork involved in setting
the national high school record in the medley relay, which the
Vaqueros did by more than a second. Cashion swam her freestyle anchor
leg in 22.7.</TE>
<TE>   "I just knew I needed to go really, really fast," she said. "I was
trying as hard as I could."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Cashion was happy to break 50 seconds, keeping pace with
Swindle, 17, and Amanda Weir, 16, of Brookwood, Ga. Swindle won the
100 freestyle and Weir was second--both under 50 seconds--at the U.S.
Short Course Championships in March.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I had to go 49 this season," Cashion said. "[Swindle and
Weir] are my age and it would be right for me to do that. Next year,
I think I can go 48."</TE>

<KH>BOYS' SWIMMER OF THE YEAR</KH>
<HD>Happy but Not Satisfied Cavic</HD>
<DH>Despite setting one national and three division records,
the Tustin senior bemoans a near miss</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long after the final spectator had left the Southern Section Division
III swimming finals last month, Michael Cavic was still doing laps in
the Olympic-sized pool at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Cavic, a senior at Tustin High, had just completed his high school
career with an astonishing series of performances, but the
celebration had to wait until his post-race warm-down routine was
over.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the biggest differences this year was I managed myself
better at the [section finals]," Cavic said. "I took the time to get
in a proper warm down after each race."</LD>
<TE>   The result was a memorable performance that saw Cavic lower his
one-day-old national high school record in the 50-yard freestyle
(19.69) and set three more division records.</TE>
<TE>   Cavic, The Times' boys' swimmer of the year, owns six division
records, twice as many as the second most-decorated swimmer.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't be happier with how it all finished," Cavic said.</TE>
<TE>   He also set divisional records in the section finals in the 100
butterfly (47.13), the 100 backstroke (47.55) and the 100 freestyle
(44.11), which he accomplished on the leadoff leg of the 400
freestyle relay.</TE>
<TE>   Cavic still owns Division II records he set as a sophomore in the
100 butterfly (48.42) and 100 backstroke (49.40).</TE>
<TE>   For all his success in the division finals, Cavic was disappointed
about finishing .13 of a second short of becoming the first swimmer
to break 47 seconds in the 100 butterfly in a high school meet. He
just missed the national high school record by .03 seconds, which he
attributed to taking an extra breath coming off the wall on his final
turn.</TE>
<TE>   Cavic shook off his disappointment by setting his national record
in the 200 freestyle relay, then surpassed all expectations by
winning the 100 backstroke in a time that was only .05 seconds off
the eight-year-old national high school record.</TE>
<TE>   Cavic was equally thrilled that he swam the event faster than
Aaron Peirsol of Newport Harbor did the night before. Peirsol is the
long- and short-course world-record holder in the 200-meter
backstroke.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have given up that race to have the 100 fly record,
though," said Cavic, who will swim for California next year.</TE>
<TE>   But Cavic wasn't finished.</TE>
<TE>   He broke his fourth division record of the day on the opening leg
of the 400 freestyle relay, the meet's final event.</TE>
<TE>   Then he swam some more, before the celebration began.</TE>

<TE>   THE TIMES' RANKINGS</TE>
<TE>   A final look at the top 10 boys' swimming teams in the Southland:</TE>
<TE>   BOYS</TE>
<TE>   1. Newport Harbor - (SS-Div. I) Won its first Division I title
behind Aaron Peirsol, Andrew Cole and Ryan Lean, who each won
individual events and swam on two winning relay teams. (Previous
ranking: No. 5)</TE>
<TE>   2. Mission Viejo - (SS-Div. I) A disqualification in the 200
freestyle relay kept the Diablos from winning the Division I title
for the 22nd time. (2)</TE>
<TE>   3. Capistrano Valley - (SS-Div. I) Cougars finished third in

<HD>Chavez Ravine Is as Beautiful as Ever</HD>

<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is midweek, midafternoon, several hours before the first pitch.</LD>
<LD>   I am sitting alone in the top row of the top deck at Dodger
Stadium, looking beyond the empty diamond, the murals on the outfield
fence, beyond the summer-tanned hills that are Chavez Ravine's
natural and panoramic answer to the warehouse of Baltimore's Camden
Yards and the skylines of Detroit's Comerica Park, Cleveland's Jacobs
Field and Pittsburgh's PNC Park.</LD>
<LD>   What I can see from this solitary and lofty location is all 40
years of Dodger Stadium history, flipping through the scrapbook of
the mind from Sandy and Big D in the 1960s to the Iron Man infield of
the '70s to Fernando, Orel and Kirk Gibson in the '80s to Nomo and
Piazza and the tumultuous change of ownership and management in the
'90s, on into the new millennium with Kazu and Odalis and Shawn
Green.</LD>
<TE>   I am sitting amid the yellow, orange, blue and red rainbow of
empty seats and I am reminded of how Dodger Stadium has been the
stage for as much drama, and occasional comedy, as the nearby Music
Center, and I am thinking of how easy it is to forget its niche as a
community treasure and a baseball shrine rivaling Boston's Fenway
Park, Chicago's Wrigley Field and New York's Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   In an era of ongoing ballpark construction, at a time when the
magic of those new facilities is evaporating quickly, in a year in
which attendance is down about 6% and 24 of the 30 teams have
experienced a decrease in per-game average from their final totals of
last year, the Dodgers are up slightly and on pace to draw more than
3 million for the seventh consecutive season and 16th time since they
first did it in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   The average of 38,010 projects to 3,078,840, and that is likely to
increase as schools let out, temperatures rise and the race in the
National League West heats up even more than its current congestion.</TE>
<TE>   Considering baseball's ever-changing aura and popularity, and the
escalating price of tickets, the ability of the Dodgers to keep the
turnstiles purring can be traced to a storied history, a booming
population base and a generally competitive team playing in a stadium
that has escaped major face lifting, continues to wear its age better
than most Tinseltown ladies and has become an attraction in itself, a
regular stop for the tourist buses and peripheral fans.</TE>
<TE>   If it has become a challenge to extract enough revenue out of a
40-year-old facility to support a $100-million payroll, the challenge
really rests with the baseball department in rebuilding the farm
system so that a competitive team can be restocked with home-grown
products who are younger and cost considerably less than ... well, a
thirtysomething pitcher vulnerable to injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Stadium is what it is, a still beautiful and functional
facility that is a tribute to Walter O'Malley's foresight, keyed the
downtown renaissance and isn't going to be duplicated or
significantly improved on by constructing a costly park closer to the
heart of downtown or a dual-purpose stadium satisfying neither
football nor baseball.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, although the Dodgers would probably be an attendance
hit playing in any facility, the new parks don't carry a warranty.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen have opened since 1989, beginning that June with
Toronto's SkyDome. The Blue Jays promptly drew more than 4 million
for three consecutive seasons, including 1992 and '93, when they won
the World Series, but attendance has steadily declined to 1.8 million
and 1.9 million in the last two years, and they are 25th among the 30
teams this year, averaging 18,339 a game.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, all 14 teams playing in a new facility are down from last
year, although the Seattle Mariners and San Francisco Giants could
both be up before the season is over.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question but that the positive shelf life of a new
stadium has shrunk considerably," Commissioner Bud Selig said by
phone. "The new parks in themselves can't be a long-term or midterm
panacea for the problems.</TE>
<TE>   "You can do all the marketing and promoting in the world and you
still have to win and win consistently."</TE>
<TE>   If the Orioles, Indians and Colorado Rockies, teams that moved
into new stadiums earlier in the most recent building cycle, enjoyed
a longer shelf life, that glow has now diminished in conjunction with
their records, and the teams that moved into new stadiums more
recently have found the honeymoon over after only one year.</TE>
<TE>   Selig's Milwaukee Brewers, for example, set a franchise record by
drawing 2.8 million last year, their first in Miller Park. They now
may set a major league record for largest second-year decline, their
per-game average dropping 10,000 to 24,241 as the team on the field
produces the worst record in the National League. Similarly, the
Pirates set a franchise record by drawing 2.4 million last year,
their first in PNC Park, but they are now down about 9,000 a game,
averaging 21,838, and there has been a comparable falloff in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   However, with parks being built in San Diego, Cincinnati and
Philadelphia, and new hope in Minnesota, Selig is quick to say, "It
would be a mistake to conclude they've lost their importance. The
Brewers, Tigers and Pirates could not have survived without new
parks, so they're still way ahead and their revenues are up even with
the drop-off in attendance."</TE>
<TE>   Whether any of the new parks can retain their youthful complexion
as well as Dodger Stadium has remains to be seen. Whether any will
still have their gates open in 40 years may be the more legitimate
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   "I was out there a couple weeks ago and you tend to forget how
really beautiful it is," Selig said of Dodger Stadium, agreeing that
it's a baseball shrine, crediting Walter O'Malley with "remarkable
vision" and adding:</TE>
<TE>   "You know, in many ways, it was the first of the new stadiums and
set off what was a building boom in the '60s, but we've basically
replaced all of those others that were built in that time frame. I
mean, it's hard to believe it's been 40 years because Dodger Stadium
looks almost new."</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner might have been even more awed had he paused for
a reverie from the top row of the top deck.</TE>

<LD>The Brewers lost two outfielders to injuries Monday night and Jose
Hernandez homered and drove in four runs off Roy Oswalt in
Milwaukee's costly 5-2 victory over the Houston Astros.</LD>
<LD>   Geoff Jenkins dislocated his right ankle and tore ligaments in the
joint and Alex Sanchez sprained his left hand and bruised his left
knee.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Cabrera (3-4) gave up two runs and five hits in a career-high
six innings, and the Brewers (24-45) moved past the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays (23-44) out of the major league cellar.</LD>
<TE>   But the Brewers were in no mood to celebrate after losing Jenkins,
one of their clubhouse leaders, and Sanchez, their speedy rookie.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins hurt his ankle lunging back to third base in the second
inning. He was carted off and taken to a hospital for X-rays, which
were negative.</TE>
<TE>   He'll undergo an MRI today to determine the extent of damage to
torn ligaments and tendons, team physician William Raasch said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, who was chasing a ball hit by Lance Berkman, sprained his
left hand and bruised his left knee running into the railing down the
left-field line. Berkman scored on an inside-the-park homer.</TE>
<TE>   Two trainers carried Sanchez off the field through the left-field

<DL>JEONJU, South Korea</DL>
<LD>Cool perspective never had a chance, not in the tipsy aftermath of
the United States' 2-0 World Cup second-round victory over Mexico on
Monday, but this much can be safely said without exaggeration or
hyperbole:</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Coach Bruce Arena spent a fairly long time in the interview
area and not once was he asked if his squad could beat the U.S.
women's soccer team.</LD>
<LD>   That one used to grind on Arena's nerves. So do most of the
questions that come his way during these postmatch scrums, actually.
But that one especially. If the mood struck him right, Arena would
mutter something about apples and oranges, and really, what else
could he say without insulting the questioner or a very fine women's
soccer team or both?</LD>
<TE>   It has taken a few years, and 90 minutes of full-body combat
disguised as a soccer match inside Jeonju World Cup Stadium, but
finally, Arena has come up with an answer.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is in the quarterfinals of the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The men's World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds even better," U.S. midfielder Earnie Stewart suggested,
"when you say, 'the last eight of the world.' "</TE>
<TE>   Superlatives were flying around like yellow cards after the U.S.
defeated Mexico, which in itself is not breaking news. The U.S.
defeated Mexico as recently as April, in an exhibition at Denver, and
is 5-1 in its last six meetings with its southern rival. After long
years of painful apprenticeship, the U.S. has figured out what it
takes to defeat Mexico on a soccer field.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a time and a place for everything, and not one of
those victories had ever come in the knockout phase of the sport's
most prestigious competition. Before Monday, the Americans had never
won a World Cup match beyond the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this has got to be the greatest win in U.S. soccer
history," said Dr. Robert Contiguglia, president of the U.S. Soccer
Federation. "Our [1950 World Cup] victory over England has been
well-described. I don't know where it got us in the tournament, but I
don't think it got us as far as this.</TE>
<TE>   "We did win against Colombia in 1994 on home soil. So that had to
be significant. And we did advance, but we were the home team. And
here, Portugal was obviously a great victory, but its impact was
lessened because of what happened with Poland. I learned the meaning
of the word 'bittersweet' when we lost that game to Poland yet still
qualified for the second round.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned the meaning of the word 'satisfied' with this victory
over Mexico. It has to be looked at as a memorable achievement for
our players."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when your post-World War II World Cup victory output is
four, every victory that comes down the pike gets the greatest-hit
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The 1-0 victory over England in 1950 was the greatest ever ...
until the 1994 victory over Colombia, because in 1950, the U.S.
failed to advance from its opening-round group.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Colombia victory became tainted when Colombia was
eliminated in the first round, same as Portugal in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Now there is June 17, 2002, and USA 2, Mexico 0.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the game was more a definition of the current state of
American soccer than a defining moment.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, there was cynicism and doubt among the U.S. media
corps, which took one look at Arena's starting lineup and immediately
declared the United States' World Cup over. Three defenders? The U.S.
can't stay with Mexico with only three in the back. No Clint Mathis,
no DaMarcus Beasley? The U.S. doesn't have the depth to win a World
Cup match without all its best players on the field. What's Arena
trying to do, play for a penalty-kick shootout? The Americans aren't
sophisticated enough--they don't know how to play for penalties.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, after the Americans' three-man back line of Eddie
Pope, Tony Sanneh and Gregg Berhalter combined to stifle the Mexican
attack, after new starter Eddie Lewis crossed to Landon Donovan for a
goal, after the Americans executed Arena's rope-a-dope defensive game
plan to near-perfection, after all that stereotype-shattering over 90
minutes, a World Cup official suggested to Arena during a studio
interview that his team has been "lucky" during this tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Two-nil or no, that's an image U.S. soccer continues to fight. Not
good enough, not smart enough, getting by only on some secret reserve
of serendipity.</TE>
<TE>   That was a reason for Mexico's six yellow cards, and for the
expulsion of Mexican captain Rafael Marquez after his crude leveling
of Cobi Jones, and for the bitter ugliness that consumed the game's
final 20 minutes, and for Mexico's fast, straight line to the exit
without shaking hands or exchanging jerseys with the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's players still have a hard time coping with the notion of
losing at its national game to a basketball country, a soccer
backwater. Italy, Croatia--these are accepted soccer forces, worthy
of Mexico's time, energy and respect. The Americans? Merely clumsy
tourists at the World Cup, having to resort to cheap gimmickry to
compensate for their technical inadequacies.</TE>
<TE>   "The other teams, they really want to play with Mexico in the open
style. Not so with the United States," Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre
complained. "They play a way that is difficult for the way Mexico
plays. And they were lucky to get that first goal."</TE>
<TE>   Which makes the Americans' recent 5-1 run in the border rivalry
all the more galling to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "We have found a game plan, so to speak, that the Mexicans find
very difficult to break down," U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel said. "I
think the other teams that have played them in the tournament have
said, 'We're going to go out and play Mexico and attack them.' And
[Mexico] just kept the ball and knocked it all over the place and
looked very, very good.</TE>
<TE>   "We put pressure on [central midfielder Gerardo] Torrado all game,
because he's been fantastic. We put fresh legs on their right-sided
midfielder [Joahan Rodriguez], who has been fantastic in the
tournament too."</TE>
<TE>   Friedel called Monday's victory the most important in U.S. soccer
history, the women's 1999 world championship notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   "By no means do I want to take anything away from what the women
have accomplished," he said, "but this is big, big news. People in
America have to understand this is huge.</TE>
<TE>   "We're down to eight teams in the entire World Cup. Not many
people thought we'd be here ....The [American] women kind of invented
the women's game, so to speak. We haven't. We've been a Third World
country in terms of soccer for a few years.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is we're making progress."</TE>
<TE>   More than that, they made a statement they needed to make, finally
at the right place and time, with the country interested enough to
stay up late and keep the television glowing.</TE>
<TE>   American success in soccer isn't just for women anymore.</TE>

<LD>Tiger Woods should win golf's Grand Slam this year.</LD>
<LD>   That's not an outrageous prediction. What's outrageous is that
there is no one to point to and say, "He could beat Tiger" at the
British Open next month at Muirfield or the PGA in August at
Hazeltine near Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Will it be Sergio Garcia, the wiggling, waggling, gripping,
re-gripping star-struck Sergio, who wanted nothing more Sunday at
Bethpage Black than to have Woods like him, talk to him, acknowledge
his existence? Garcia went so far as to pick up Woods' divot from
where it landed in a sand trap and deliver it to him. Would Woods do
the same?</LD>
<TE>   Or will it be Phil Mickelson, gambling, grinning, giddy Mickelson
who finished second to Woods at the U.S. Open and was inordinately
pleased with himself. Still no major titles for Phil, but he was
happy as a clam to have been within two shots of Woods a couple of
times Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is 26, just approaching his athletic prime. Woods is, by a
significant margin, the best athlete on the golf tour. Woods is, by a
significant margin, the mentally strongest man on the golf tour. And
Woods is, by a significant margin, the fiercest, toughest competitor
on the golf tour. Woods is the hardest worker, the most conscientious
preparer.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Woods wins the British Open at Muirfield--a links course
of essential fairness favoring a long and accurate driver--is totally
up to Tiger.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years ago, Jack Nicklaus won the first two legs of the
Grand Slam. No one has done it since.</TE>
<TE>   And then Nicklaus went off to a British Open played at Muirfield,
where he had won the event six years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus lost the 1972 British Open by a stroke to Lee Trevino.</TE>
<TE>   What golf is missing now is a Trevino. Trevino led Nicklaus by
five going into the final round and hung on because Trevino was a
winner too. Nicklaus shot a final-round 66. Nicklaus actually took
the lead. Trevino took it back. Can you imagine Mickelson or Garcia
taking the lead back from Woods? Mickelson would do a happy dance
over having led at all in the final round of a major. Garcia would
help Woods find his ball in the gorse or one of those fairway bunkers
and hope Woods said, "Thanks."</TE>
<TE>   In an excerpt from Tour '72, by Michael D'Antonio in Golf
magazine, when Trevino heard the roar of the crowd after Nicklaus'
birdie, Trevino turned to his caddie and said: "We're behind, son.
Gimme that driver. We're going to make something happen."</TE>
<TE>   And Trevino did. He eagled the ninth hole and regained the lead. A
great battle had been joined.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the final round at the '72 British, Trevino,
Nicklaus and Tony Jacklin were tied for the lead. There is no Tony
Jacklin now. Or Nick Faldo or Seve Ballesteros, other great European
challengers. Woods has Colin Montgomerie, a perennially grumpy,
rabbit-eared, high-strung runner-up.</TE>
<TE>   On the 17th hole at Muirfield, Trevino hooked his drive into a
bunker. After two hacking shots, and still short of the green,
Trevino was furious and frustrated. According to D'Antonio, Trevino
said: "I was steaming. I was so mad I was just going to hit it and
then hit it again. I didn't care if I made eight."</TE>
<TE>   Trevino didn't make eight. The ball landed in the cup. It was a
miraculous shot, a save of par.</TE>
<TE>   None of Woods' contemporaries get mad at their bad shots. They get
mad at wise guys in the gallery. They get mad if it rains harder on
them then it does on Woods. They get mad when the media keep tally of
how many majors they haven't won. But getting mad and holing out a
par-saver from British Open rough? Not happening.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Classic Courses of Great Britain and Ireland," Scottish
writer and Walker Cup golfer Sam McKinlay said of Muirfield: "A man
who is in command of his game and himself will fare better at
Muirfield than almost any other course I know."</TE>
<TE>   There is no man more in command of himself and of his game than
Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Deep and gloomy sand traps; knee-high, impenetrable rough; brutal
windy, rainy weather; these are the hallmarks of Muirfield. Woods has
the strength, the nerve, the touch, to tame the bunkers and rough.
When he played at Stanford, Woods practiced in the worst Pacific
Coast storms so he would be ready for weather. Who among Tiger's
fellow pros is doing that, or has ever done that?</TE>
<TE>   British Open champions who have won at Muirfield have been men who
will always be considered great. Not the John Dalys but Nicklaus,
Trevino, Henry Cotton, Gary Player, Tom Watson, Faldo. Woods' name
will fit nicely in that group.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe if Tiger completes the Slam Sweep this year, someone
will finally get Trevino-mad, take a club and start swinging for the
cup. Maybe someone will do what Nicklaus did when he decided there
had to be more to his game than talent, that conditioning really
mattered.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe someone will care enough to win the trophies and not be
pleased with the big checks. Because Woods wants those trophies. All
of them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Where were you?</LD>
<LD>   I remember where I was when I learned the wife was pregnant for
the first time, and what race they were running at Arlington Park.
Lost by a nose, too.</LD>
<LD>   I remember where I was when the youngest daughter told me she was
getting engaged to the Grocery Store Bagger because I hurt myself
falling off the stool.</LD>
<TE>   And 10 or 20 years from now when folks recall where they were when
our side stunned the futbol world with a stirring 2-nil win over
Mexico in a tension-filled televised World Cup match, I'll have to
explain why I was sleeping.</TE>
<TE>   I just couldn't bear to watch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW TO be honest it usually takes something really special to keep
my eyes open after 10 p.m., and Sunday night it was just the wife and
I in a San Diego hotel room and the TV didn't have HBO. Frankly, we
probably should have checked out.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll stay up with you and read my book if you want to watch
soccer," the wife said, and there's something about hotel rooms that
makes her wild and crazy like that.</TE>
<TE>   I had something else in mind, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't we go to sleep so you're not crabby in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   I guess she took my advice because I never heard another word out
of her before I dozed off, and I probably would have slept the whole
night had it not been for the screaming in the next room.</TE>
<TE>   Someone had scored, and from what I could tell, it was an
American, and although I'd rather attend a Dr. Phil seminar with the
wife than watch a single minute of soccer, I think every one of us is
excited when an American scores at anything. And apparently it was
1-0 in favor of the U.S. soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   Now awake, with my eyes open in the dark, I wondered if we could
hold on. I thought about waking up the wife, but I had a feeling
there might be a penalty kick involved, and decided to leave her
snoring.</TE>
<TE>   And that's the darn thing about soccer; it can really hurt you. In
fact, that's probably the main reason I'm not interested in the
sport--I want to live longer.</TE>
<TE>   When the World Cup began they said a billion people would be
watching, but already that number has plummeted to something like
999,999,991. They keep playing this thing much longer and world
over-crowding will no longer be a concern.</TE>
<TE>   One person died after a fight over the TV remote control to watch
a game. I think back to those nights when I thought about trying to
switch from "Felicity" to "The Best Damn Sports Show Period," and I'm
so glad I just left the house instead.</TE>
<TE>   Another person died in a fight after losing a soccer wager,
several have succumbed to heart attacks because one of the soccer
teams apparently scored two goals in the same game, and the list is
even longer of those injured seriously by celebrations gone amuck.</TE>
<TE>   I've seen how excited our neighbors Tom &amp; Aida get after a Sparks'
win, so I guess it was a good thing we were staying in a hotel when
our guys beat Mexico. We came home to find just a flat tire on the
car we left behind, and no sign of any police cars. I worry now,
however, about what Tom &amp; Aida might do if we beat the Germans, or
worse, I worry now what they might do if we don't beat the Germans.</TE>
<TE>   I worry now I even know we're going to play the Germans next.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE GROCERY Store Bagger gave me the latest edition of "Soccer
Digest" for Father's Day, and declared himself a diehard soccer fan.
I was hoping he was going to declare his undying love for someone
else, and make it a real Father's Day.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me guess," I told him, "you've been a soccer fan ever since
Brandi Chastain tore off her top."</TE>
<TE>   That's when the daughter piped in: "Wait until Ronaldo takes off
his top."</TE>
<TE>   A cold chill ran down my spine: Imagine having to go to a soccer
game some day to watch the grandchildren play. It could be worse, I
guess. They could play soccer in the summer, and hockey in the
winter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ANSCHUTZ Empire announced it has pulled out of the football
business for the second time because it can't stomach competition.
That's a shame, because if Phil Anschutz and Tim Leiweke can't
stomach competition, that would have made them ideal owners of the
Los Angeles Chargers, who have proven consistently over the years
they can't handle competition.</TE>
<TE>   Now we're supposed to believe, and blame, the Coliseum for forcing
the Anschutz Empire to call it quits.</TE>
<TE>   I believe it's all part of a plan to rally support for the
Anschutz project, turning politicians and the NFL against the
Coliseum and then uniting them behind Leiweke.</TE>
<TE>   I don't believe Leiweke is finished with football.</TE>
<TE>   Some time after November, when Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas
leaves office, and the Chargers have done their stadium dance with
San Diego officials, look for L.A. Mayor Jim Hahn to invite/plead
with the Anschutz Empire to re-enter the football market and save the
day.</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to know if the Anschutz Empire is still holding onto the
land options for the football stadium. That would mean they're still
in the football business despite what they say publicly. Wouldn't
that be a shock to learn Leiweke &amp; Co. weren't telling the truth all
along?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TELL ME, is there any athlete more annoying in all of sports than
Sergio Garcia preparing to hit a golf shot?</TE>
<TE>   Jack Haley talking basketball on Fox doesn't count. He's an
ex-athlete.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Samuel S:</TE>
<TE>   "How come you haven't written anything about the hookers at that
golf course in Norco?"</TE>
<TE>   I see hookers on every course I play; I don't think they're just
in Norco.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Get Askamp on Day of Trades</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The Sparks' tinkering isn't over despite the 7-1 start by the 2001
WNBA champions.</LD>
<LD>   Monday, the Sparks gave Miami their 2003 top draft pick in
exchange for 6-foot-5 veteran center Marlies Askamp, who has played
in seven games with the Sol this season.</LD>
<LD>   Askamp was the Sol's all-time leader in offensive (131) and total
rebounds (318). She ranks sixth all-time in the WNBA in offensive
rebounds (325). Askamp has averaged 12.3 minutes, 1.8 rebounds and
1.8 points a game with the Sol this year.</LD>
<TE>   She is expected to join the Sparks when they return to Los Angeles
after tonight's game.</TE>
<TE>   To make room for Askamp, the Sparks placed center Katryna Gaither
on the injured reserve list.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed another big body to take some legitimate minutes off of
Lisa [Leslie]," Coach Michael Cooper said. "I think it's a great deal
for us [because] we got her for virtually nothing. I don't think our
draft position is going to be that great next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Marlies is a veteran who knows the league. Here's an opportunity
for her to possibly get a championship and extend her career. And not
that we weren't big before, but we are legitimately big now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks weren't the only ones making a move Monday. Seattle
made a trade with Houston, sending veteran guard Sonja Henning to the
Comets for second-year forward Amanda Lassiter.</TE>
<TE>   The Comets also sent 6-3 center Elena Shakirova to Charlotte in
exchange for the Sting's third-round pick in the 2003 draft.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Coach Lin Dunn said that she had trade talks for months
regarding Henning, the president of the WNBA players' union who last
week caused a stir when she suggested the players might consider a
strike after the season.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed a young small forward, and Amanda was one of the top
three forwards we thought might be available," Dunn said.</TE>

<KH>DODGER STADIUM AT 40 YEARS</KH>
<HD>Their Blue Haven</HD>
<DH>It's not the youngest park anymore, but no one wants to
replace it</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter O'Malley stood on the mound and smiled approvingly because
Dodger Stadium still sparkled on its 40th anniversary.</LD>
<LD>   There to deliver the season's ceremonial first pitch April 2, the
club's former owner was joined by a sellout crowd in celebrating
another milestone at the stadium that his late father, Walter,
envisioned being baseball's "Taj Mahal," and which continues to
impress after all these years. But although O'Malley reveled in the
moment, he is aware of the reality facing the major leagues'
fourth-oldest facility.</LD>
<LD>   "The challenge today, just like the Cubs have in Chicago with
Wrigley Field or the Red Sox in Boston with Fenway Park, is, 'How do
you stay competitive with these very fan-friendly new stadiums?' " he
said. "To be competitive today, particularly with player salaries
continuing to escalate, the teams must raise their revenues, must
grow revenues, and that's difficult in a stadium that's 40, 50 or 60
years old. Very difficult."</LD>
<TE>   The 56,000-seat hilltop structure at Chavez Ravine continues to be
a cash cow for the Dodgers--keeping the club among baseball's top
revenue producers--and a beloved community treasure. But despite a
recent $50-million facelift, the ballpark can't keep pace with the
Dodgers' spiraling expenses, including a $100-million payroll. Fox
would rather continue to subsidize the Dodgers through annual loans
than privately finance a new stadium, which could cost as much as
$600 million, and there would be no support for public financing at
the site.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers dismiss speculation they might leave their golden
perch to share a downtown multipurpose facility if one was built to
lure back the NFL, so maximizing the building's earning potential is
a key to the franchise's future. However, that's complicated because
of management's sensitivity about the traditions established under
the family-friendly O'Malleys.</TE>
<TE>   "Is the stadium still viable? Absolutely," said President Bob
Graziano, in his 17th year with the club. "The main reason it's still
viable is because over the last 40 years we've put a significant
amount of money into the stadium to keep it looking as good and
performing as well as it has since the day it opened. Things continue
to have to be done to the stadium, as with a house or a car, and
that's what we've done.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the new ballparks, the revenue streams that
Dodger Stadium didn't have three, four, five years ago we now have.
We're talking about luxury suites, dugout seats and other items that
now make us more competitive. Are we number one in terms of stadium
revenues? No. But what we've been able to do is maintain the
tradition of Dodger Stadium while at the same time enhancing revenue
streams."</TE>
<TE>   Fenway Park is the majors' oldest facility, having opened for
baseball in 1912. The first game was played at Wrigley Field in 1914
and Yankee Stadium opened in 1923. Like Dodger Stadium, those
ballparks have undergone many modernization projects throughout the
decades, with Yankee Stadium reopening in 1976 after having been
closed for two years for refurbishing.</TE>
<TE>   In the National League West, the Arizona Diamondbacks, Colorado
Rockies and San Francisco Giants play in recently constructed,
state-of-the-art ballparks, and the San Diego Padres' new stadium is
under construction. In an attempt to keep up, the Dodgers made
significant additions to Dodger Stadium before the 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   On the club level, they added 33 luxury suites, several conference
rooms, a business center and renovated the Stadium Club. A nine-row,
565-seat area was added behind the dugouts and a sports bar-themed
Dugout Club was built.</TE>
<TE>   Although the club has not sold out the suites, which can be leased
for $275,000 to $300,000 for a full season, or the dugout seats,
listed between $175 and $200, the additions have provided a major
revenue boost.</TE>
<TE>   Citing major league policy, the Dodgers declined to reveal their
total operating revenue, of which most is stadium generated. However,
according to numbers reported to the House Judiciary Committee in
December and obtained by The Times, the Dodgers generated an all-time
revenue high of $143.607 million in 2001--based on ticket sales,
concessions, parking, stadium signage and broadcasting
payments--ranking eighth in baseball. The Yankees, annually atop the
list because of their industry-high broadcast rights, were No. 1 at
$242.208 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' revenue increased more than $13 million from 2000,
the first season of the suites and dugout seats. The club's 1995
revenue of $69 million was less than half of the 2001 total.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Giants were fifth in revenue at $172.950 million,
the Rockies No. 11 at $131.813 million, the Diamondbacks No. 14 at
$125.132 million and the Padres 24th at $79.722 million. Local TV,
cable and radio payments accounted for about $25 million of the
Dodgers' revenue and about $17 million of the Giants' total, and each
team receives about $15 million from Fox's national TV package.</TE>
<TE>   That means that the Giants generated about $37.4 million more at
Pacific Bell Park, which opened in 2000, than the Dodgers did at
Dodger Stadium. But the Giants also have $20 million a year in debt
service on their privately financed stadium, shrinking the profit gap
between them and the Dodgers to about $17.4 million. The Dodgers
could presumably generate more than that figure by increasing ticket
prices and accepting forms of advertising they currently reject, so
how much would a new stadium really help?</TE>
<TE>   "The Dodgers' problems, to the extent that they've had any
problems the last four or five years, have got nothing to do with
Dodger Stadium," said Peter Magowan, San Francisco Giant managing
general partner. "They've got a crown jewel of a ballpark. It's 40
years old but it sure doesn't look it. It's a beautifully maintained
place, a key asset for the Dodgers, and the renovations they've done
so far have increased their revenue and make a lot of economic sense.</TE>
<TE>   "What has surprised a lot of people about the Dodgers is not what
their revenue numbers are but what their expense numbers are. That
produces these huge losses, and it's not right to see a team in the
second-biggest market in the United States drawing over 3 million
people and losing the kind of money they're losing. There's only one
answer as to why they lost that and everyone knows what it is:
payroll. The problem is what's in that dugout."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodger payroll has skyrocketed under Fox, ballooning from
about $50 million at the start of the 1998 season to about $116
million last season. The club is in the $103-million range this
season and still burdened by multiyear contracts doled out between
1998 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "The economics have drastically changed," said O'Malley, not
commenting on the club's decisions. "That's one of the reasons why we
considered selling the team, because we saw that there was no control
on the escalation of salaries.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew we could grow revenues, but I was concerned we could grow
the revenues fast enough to cover a $50-, $60-, $70-, $80-million
payroll. I never dreamed it would go to $100 [million]."</TE>
<TE>   A new Dodger Stadium already might have been in the works had
politicians not persuaded O'Malley to abandon his pursuit of an NFL
franchise in 1996 in hopes the Coliseum would be considered as a
future expansion or relocation site. O'Malley hoped that building a
new football stadium adjacent to Dodger Stadium would have sparked
community support for a new baseball stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Then we would have ended up with two extraordinary facilities,"
he said. "At least, that was the long-range goal; football first and
then redoing Dodger Stadium."</TE>
<TE>   Before settling on the $50-million renovation plan in 2000, the
Dodgers considered a bigger project along the lines of the
$100-million makeover the Angels gave Edison Field before the 1998
season. But Dodger Stadium presents unique and costly expansion
problems because it is built into a hill.</TE>
<TE>   Widening concourses, reconfiguring support structures and
environmental issues would have pushed costs into the $200-million
range. Fox decided that was too much for only an incremental revenue
bump.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the construction challenges of building into the
hillside, a new stadium on the site could cost as much as $600
million. Dodger Stadium was privately financed at a cost of
approximately $20 million in 1962, but Fox is not willing to go that
route, especially considering that extra revenue generated by the
stadium would be subject to revenue sharing.</TE>
<TE>   "The economics of building a new ballpark just don't make a whole
lot of sense at this point in time," Graziano said. "Also, as you
look at greater revenue sharing, and we're sharing more revenue than
we ever have today, you have to look at whether the investment to
generate that still makes as much sense. And this isn't a situation
like the other ballparks in the National League West, or in Major
League Baseball, where the fans were not happy going to those
ballparks.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fans are very, very happy coming to this ballpark. Does it
lack some of the conveniences of some of the newer ballparks?
Absolutely. But our fans love coming here. They came here as kids and
they like bringing their children back to the ballpark. We
continually listen to the fans, and if at some point that changed we
would start looking at it more carefully, but it hasn't changed."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have drawn more than 3 million in attendance in each
of the last six seasons despite last qualifying for the playoffs in
1996 and last winning a playoff game in '88. But even with record
revenues and one of baseball's strongest fan bases, the club claimed
staggering losses of $60 million in 2001 and borrows from Fox each
season to meet its commitments.</TE>
<TE>   The business-side operation has not been able to keep pace with
the baseball operation, though Graziano and his top lieutenants have
tried through the renovations and increased advertising in the
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to clutter the place with signage and ruin the
aesthetic nature of the ballpark, and yet we had a need to seriously
drive more revenue in that area," said Kris Rone, executive vice
president of marketing. "It worked and we've done very well,
competitively speaking.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the other clubs, we're right among the top teams
as far as sponsorship revenue. But we did have to make a change. We
had to add that signage, otherwise it wouldn't have been possible for
us to extract the revenue we have."</TE>
<TE>   Since implementing the signage program four years ago, the club's
sponsorship revenue has increased from about $10 million to more than
$20 million. The Dodgers could reap even bigger rewards but don't
accept advertising for hard liquor and other products they don't deem
"family friendly."</TE>
<TE>   The club has shied away from other many money-making opportunities
because of concerns about fan reaction. The Dodgers have not entered
the naming-rights market and have maintained comparatively low ticket
prices--including 10,000 seats at $6.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dodgers could sell the naming rights for this ballpark for
one hell of a lot of money," Magowan said. "There's no question about
that."</TE>
<TE>   But the benefits of a naming-rights deal for the Dodgers, even
with a lucrative payout, are outweighed by the disadvantages,
Graziano said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans have grown up with it being Dodger Stadium, and that
doesn't change by putting a corporate name on it, so the value for a
company to do that is low and the benefit to us is not great," he
said. "It's a different story in new buildings where the stadium is
always known by the corporate name."</TE>
<TE>   So the Dodgers will remain at Dodger Stadium for the foreseeable
future. That's just the economic reality of the present.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dodgers do a lot of things right, and there's no reason why
15 years from now [Dodger Stadium] won't still be just as good as it
is today," Magowan said. "But the Dodgers have seen their competitors
begin to catch up with them because of their new stadiums. That's
what has changed."</TE>

<TE>   Dodger Stadium History</TE>
<TE>   * April 10, 1962--Dodger Stadium opens with seating for 56,000,
parking for 16,000 automobiles on 21 terraced lots, more than 3,400
trees covering the 300 acres of landscape.</TE>
<TE>   * 1978--Dodger Stadium becomes the first ballpark to play host to
more than 3 million fans in a season when the Dodgers draw 3,347,845
in attendance. After another 3-million attendance mark in 1980, the
Dodgers set the all-time major league season attendance record in
1982, drawing 3,608,881 fans. (Toronto, Colorado and Atlanta have
since topped that mark.)</TE>
<TE>   * 1996--The Dodgers install a state-of-the-art grass field for
first time since stadium opened in 1962. Prescription Athletic Turf
(PAT) used the latest agronomic and engineering technology to manage
field moisture through controlled drainage and irrigation.</TE>
<TE>   * January 1999--The Dodgers announce a program of limited
renovation of Dodger Stadium to help make it more economically
competitive with other ballparks across the nation. By the start of
the 2000 season, the Dodgers add field-level seats down the foul
lines beyond the dugouts and an expanded dugout section with an
adjacent club area. In addition, suites are added on the Club Level
to provide amenities that are now available at every other major
league ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   * Dodger fans have witnessed 3,208 regular-season games at Dodger
Stadium, including a 1,833-1,375 (.571) record posted by the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   * Stadium played host to All-Star game in 1980 and the Olympic
Games' baseball competition in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   * Although only baseball is played at Dodger Stadium, Pope John
Paul II celebrated Mass at Dodger Stadium on Sept. 16, 1987.
Entertainers such as KISS, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Bee
Gees, Elton John, Simon and Garfunkel, Michael Jackson, David Bowie,
Eric Clapton and U2 have performed at the stadium.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Colangelo and Donald Fehr are scheduled to attend a Senate
commerce subcommittee hearing today to discuss reports of widespread
steroid use by major league baseball players.</LD>
<LD>   Colangelo, owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks, and Fehr, executive
director and general counsel of the Major League Baseball Players'
Assn., are among six witnesses called by Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.),
the committee's chairman.</LD>
<LD>   With State Sen. Don Perata (D-Oakland) also proposing all
professional athletes in California submit to steroid tests before
being allowed to play in the state, a message is becoming clear: If
major league owners and players cannot agree on a response to the
reported use of steroids, legislators might impose one.</LD>
<TE>   "Steroids are illegal. If the government steps in and says you
have to test, I see nothing wrong with that," said Angel pitcher and
player representative Jarrod Washburn. "But I don't think it will
come to that. I see something happening before then."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Manfred, Major League Baseball's executive vice president
for labor relations who submitted the players an 11-page steroid
testing plan in February, also will attend Dorgan's hearing. The
Players' Assn. has yet to formally respond to the owners' proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Others expected to address the subcommittee are Dr. Bernard
Greisemer, who will discuss the health effects of steroid use, and
former Olympic marathon champion Frank Shorter, chairman of the
United States Anti-Doping Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Piatt, a spokesman in Dorgan's Washington office, said
additional hearings are possible, based on today's discussions.</TE>

<TE>   "The land of the free, the home of the brave. It's into the round
of eight."</TE>
<TE>   That's a far cry from Michaels' classic line: "Do you believe in
miracles?"</TE>
<TE>   Michaels' line after the U.S. Olympic hockey team's victory over
the Soviet Union in 1980 was spontaneous, and it sounded that way.
Edwards' line sounded contrived and rehearsed.</TE>
<TE>   So did Edwards' line after the U.S. defeated Portugal: "Mine eyes
have seen the glory."</TE>
<TE>   As for Edwards matching Cantor's famous call of "goooooool," he's
off the mark there too. Edwards tries, but his "scooore" falls short.</TE>
<TE>   Some English-speaking soccer fans prefer Univision, or other
Spanish-language telecasts, because they say the announcers show more
genuine enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards and ESPN analyst Ty Keough certainly show enthusiasm, but
it's not the same.</TE>
<TE>   When you hear Cantor, who is calling games on radio at this World
Cup, or another Spanish-speaking announcer crank up the emotion, it
seems appropriate and proper.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Edwards and Keough do a pretty good job. One good thing
is they aren't all rah-rah for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   There was one point in the victory over Mexico where at first
glance it seemed they were too pro-U.S., but a closer inspection
shows they were right.</TE>
<TE>   In the 66th minute, Mexico's Luis Hernandez was called for diving
in the penalty box. In one replay it appeared as though U.S. defender
Eddie Pope might have clipped Hernandez with his heel. But even
ardent Mexico fans said Hernandez took a dive, that Pope did not trip
him.</TE>
<TE>   A critical moment in the game came in the 57th minute. Mexico had
a corner kick with the U.S. leading, 1-0, and U.S. midfielder John
O'Brien appeared to punch the ball out of danger.</TE>
<TE>   No hand ball was called, and Edwards called it "a terrible
non-call." Keough also called it a bad non-call. O'Brien later
admitted his hand had hit the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards was initially hired by ESPN as a "SportsCenter" anchor but
in recent years has also been calling Major League Soccer for the
network.</TE>
<TE>   Keough, a former U.S. team member, has been ESPN's lead soccer
analyst for seven years.</TE>
<TE>   At least they don't use "we" or "our" when talking about the U.S.
team. There was a time when U.S. broadcasters were guilty of that.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Edwards and Keough may have been softer on Mexico's players
for roughhouse tactics toward the end of the game than were Univision
announcers Pablo Ramirez and Jesus Bracomontes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Brian McBride scored the first goal for the U.S. in the
eighth minute, Edwards did a good job of putting it into perspective.
He reminded viewers that at this point in the team's previous game
against Poland, the U.S. already trailed, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   And an ESPN graphic let viewers know the odds Mexico was facing.
The graphic noted that the U.S. was 5-1-1 in the World Cup when
scoring the first goal. Conversely, the graphic pointed out, the U.S.
was 0-12-1 when its opponent scored first.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How many people tuned into the ESPN telecast, which began at 11:30
p.m. PDT Sunday, won't be known until late today.</TE>
<TE>   But one thing is certain. ESPN certainly didn't attract the number
of viewers in Los Angeles that the Univision telecast did on Channel
34. Over-the-air ratings are more readily available than cable
ratings, so the Channel 34 numbers are known--and they're
record-setting.</TE>
<TE>   Channel 34 got an 11.5 rating with a 32 share. That's the highest
rating for a soccer match on Channel 34, and it's the second-highest
rating for all programming. The 11.5/32 beat the 9.0/22 for
Mexico-Ecuador in the opening round. The highest rating for all
programming at Channel 34 was a 12.0 (16 share) for the prime-time
novela, "La Mentira," on Feb. 18, 1999. The 11.5 topped all other
sports ratings in L.A. over the weekend.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JEONJU, South Korea</DL>
<LD>Suddenly, the Germans are nervous. Suddenly, the Americans are a
threat. Suddenly, the world is paying attention.</LD>
<LD>   It's amazing what a little thing like a victory over Mexico can
do. If it comes at the right time, in the right tournament, it can
propel a team into realms previously undreamed.</LD>
<LD>   Monday was that time. The World Cup is that tournament.</LD>
<TE>   The United States, which came to South Korea with the modest goal
of reaching the second round of soccer's quadrennial world
championship, suddenly finds itself in the quarterfinals, with a date
to play three-time world champion Germany on Friday for a place in
the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   These are uncharted waters that the U.S. team has sailed into,
thanks to its 2-0 victory over Mexico Monday afternoon before 33,680
in a space-age stadium set among the rice paddies of rural Jeonju.</TE>
<TE>   No one expected this, least of all the Mexicans.</TE>
<TE>   But goals on either side of halftime by Brian McBride and Landon
Donovan, combined with superb goalkeeping by Brad Friedel, excellent
defensive play by the entire team, tactically astute moves by Coach
Bruce Arena and a referee's controversial non-call, have made the
U.S.--dare it be said?--a World Cup contender.</TE>
<TE>   Rudi Voeller, Germany's coach and a World Cup winner himself in
1990, thinks so.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mexicans played better, but ... the Americans were dangerous
on the counterattack, and they kept going until the end," Voeller
said. "We're going to have to take our chances. No one expected them
to get this far, and they're really on a roll. Their confidence is
going to be high."</TE>
<TE>   Yes it is, and for three good reasons.</TE>
<TE>   * Monday's history-making victory marked the first time since the
inaugural World Cup in Uruguay in 1930 that the U.S. has progressed
this far in the sport's premier event. Back then, in a small
tournament with an uncertain future, the U.S. played only three
games, winning the first two before losing to Argentina in the
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   * Monday also marked the first time in more than a half-century
that the U.S. has shut out a World Cup opponent. The previous victim
was England, which fell, 1-0, at Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   * Even if it loses to Germany, the U.S. team will leave this World
Cup with a .500 or better record, the first time that has happened
since 1930 and a far cry from the dismal 0-3 record of 1998. The
stigma of France '98 has been erased.</TE>
<TE>   "Our guys left everything on the field today," Arena said. "It's a
great day for U.S. soccer."</TE>
<TE>   There have been momentous victories before for U.S. teams. World
powers Argentina, Brazil, England and Germany have all been defeated
at one time or another, but Monday's triumph puts them all in the
shade.</TE>
<TE>   This was the World Cup. This was for a place in the final eight.
This was against Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   It was a victory on several levels. Its importance on the national
stage was underscored by the phone call President Bush made to
Mexican President Vicente Fox, as each nation's leader wished the
other well.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also called the U.S. team before the game. "I just hung up
the phone a little earlier with the president of Mexico," Bush told
Arena. "He was very gracious. I didn't declare victory yet, but I
feel pretty confident."</TE>
<TE>   Such confidence, even from someone who admitted little knowledge
of soccer, was justified just eight minutes into the game when the
U.S. took a lead it didn't relinquish.</TE>
<TE>   It also was a victory on the coaching level. By altering his
starting lineup and formation again, Arena and his assistants came up
with a game plan that confounded Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre.</TE>
<TE>   Arena adopted a 3-5-2 formation, with Tony Sanneh, Eddie Pope and
Gregg Berhalter forming the back line in front of Friedel. He had a
five-man midfield that featured Claudio Reyna, Pablo Mastroeni, John
O'Brien, Donovan and Eddie Lewis. His two strikers were McBride and
Josh Wolff.</TE>
<TE>   The lineup and formation caught Mexico off guard. Berhalter had
not played in the tournament until Monday. Lewis had played only 16
minutes and Wolff nine.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we needed some fresh legs in here today," Arena said.</TE>
<TE>   The game was incident-packed from start to finish. There were
goals of high quality, the non-call, and some ugly scenes near the
end when Mexico realized that its cause was lost.</TE>
<TE>   Arena's plan coming into the game was to pack the midfield, absorb
whatever Mexico could provide in the way of offense, and then
counterattack the Mexicans. McBride's goal was created on just such a
counter in the eighth minute.</TE>
<TE>   Reyna, looking more comfortable than ever in an unaccustomed right
midfield position, overlapped down the right wing, beating Ramon
Morales in the process, before crossing the ball to Wolff at the near
post.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff cut the ball sharply back out to McBride, who found himself
momentarily unmarked by Mexican defenders.</TE>
<TE>   McBride's shot flashed past Mexico goalkeeper Oscar Perez before
Perez could react, and the U.S., which had given up two goals in the
first five minutes during its first-round loss to Poland on Friday,
suddenly held a surprise lead.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico started with the 11 players who had taken the team into the
second round with an unbeaten record. But they proved no match for
the U.S. even though the conditions suited them better.</TE>
<TE>   "We played with a lot of heart," said Sanneh, whose mistake-free
play at right back has been one of the revelations of the tournament
for the U.S. "We didn't have the ball for long periods of time in the
beginning, but we defended well. We didn't give them a lot of good
[scoring] chances and then we got a lucky goal, and we just fought
from there.</TE>
<TE>   "The key was our goal. It allowed us to keep playing the way we
were playing and just sit back [and defend the lead]."</TE>
<TE>   With 27 minutes gone and his team showing no sign of being able to
unlock the puzzle posed by the U.S. defense, Aguirre made the first
of his substitutions when he took Morales out and replaced him with
former Galaxy forward Luis Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   It would prove to be a crucial mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Major League Soccer defenders Pope and Mastroeni are wise to
Hernandez's tricks from his two seasons in MLS and the Mexican
striker was given little chance to showcase his once-formidable
skills.</TE>
<TE>   With Hernandez ineffective and the lanky Jared Borgetti not
getting the type of service from midfield that would allow him to
exploit his power in the air, Mexico struggled, generating only two
scoring chances.</TE>
<TE>   The game's most controversial moment came early in the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   A Mexico corner kick was floated into the U.S. penalty area and in
the tangle of bodies that rose to meet it, O'Brien appeared to
deliberately knock the ball away with his fist or arm.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican bench rose in unison to appeal for a penalty kick.
Aguirre did too. But referee Vito Melo Pereira of Portugal waived
play on.</TE>
<TE>   "They showed it on the big screen and we saw it, 40,000 fans saw
it," an anguished Aguirre said. "That's where the game began to
really fall apart for us."</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien called it a "freak play" in which his arm had been forced
upward and into contact with the ball.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexicans were in for another shock in the 65th minute when the
Americans again caught them on a fastbreak. This time it was Lewis
speeding down the left wing who did the damage, sending a perfect
centering ball for Donovan to race under and head into the net on the
dead run.</TE>
<TE>   With about 15 minutes remaining, Aguirre made another move that
seemed to backfire. Trailing by two goals and with more-than-capable
forward Francisco Palencia waiting on the bench, Mexico's coach used
his final substitution to bring 35-year-old midfielder Alberto Garcia
Aspe into the game.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, it was a thank you, Garcia Aspe having been the player
who helped revitalize the Mexico team when Aguirre took over as
coach. But Garcia Aspe's contribution was negative, one of his first
acts being a hard foul on U.S. substitute Cobi Jones near the
sideline.</TE>
<TE>   At this point the game turned ugly, with fouls and retaliatory
fouls marring play.</TE>
<TE>   The worst of these was when defender Rafael Marquez slammed his
head into the side of Jones' head. Marquez got a red card for his
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball was in the air and I just went for it," Marquez said.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt it," countered a still-groggy Jones, who was fouled hard
three times in his few minutes on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why they feel they have to take their aggressions
out on me. As far as I'm concerned, they're a bunch of dirty players
and they're going home. We beat them in the World Cup. Goodbye."</TE>

<HD>Walker Will Stay a Laker</HD>

<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a brief meeting Monday morning in El Segundo, Laker forward Samaki
Walker told General Manager Mitch Kupchak that he would return next
season.</LD>
<LD>   In what will be a weak off-season for free-agent power forwards,
Walker's decision to exercise his option--at $1.54 million--saves the
Lakers from the possibilities of having to start the fragile Robert
Horry or one of their developing forwards, Mark Madsen and Slava
Medvedenko.</LD>
<LD>   Walker, 26, averaged 6.7 points and seven rebounds in 24 minutes.
He started 63 games.</LD>
<TE>   A midseason elbow injury cost him 13 games on the injured list,
and a bone bruise on his left knee limited his playoff effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Three games into the Western Conference semifinals, Phil Jackson
started Horry over Walker, who averaged 3.3 points and 4.1 rebounds
in 12.6 postseason minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Walker could have become a free agent, as he was a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants to be here," Kupchak said. "He came to us for lesser
money than he could have gotten. My guess is, it's tough to judge
what the market will be this summer. But this is where he wanted to
be. He feels this is a place where he can flourish."</TE>
<TE>   Walker, along with guard Derek Fisher, was to be examined by a
physician Monday or today during the club's normal exit examinations.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher has had surgery to repair stress fractures in his right
foot each of the last two summers, so team medical personnel will pay
particular attention to him.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal, whose arthritic big toe bothered him much of the
season, said last week that he would spend most of the summer
gathering opinions on treatment before considering surgery. Kupchak
said he would encourage O'Neal to hasten that process.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll ask him not to wait until October," Kupchak said.</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak also spoke briefly Monday with guard Lindsey Hunter, who
may opt out of his contract, due to pay him about $8 million over the
next two seasons. He said Hunter hadn't yet decided, but that he
would by the weekend.</TE>
