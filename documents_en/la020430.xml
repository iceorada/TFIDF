<LD>An impossibly narrow road leads higher and higher, beyond the crush
of traffic to a hilltop restaurant with stunning views of the
glittering city. If it weren't for the crowd--willowy women in
spectacularly revealing clothes and the well-coiffed men hovering
around them--the site would resemble a turn-of-the-century Japanese
palace.</LD>
<LD>   It's Yamashiro, of course, and the men's magazine Maxim is hosting
a party at the restaurant to celebrate its list of the hottest 100
women--actresses, models, musicians and athletes. (Jennifer Garner of
TV's "Alias" earned the No. 1 spot. "Spider-Man" star Kirsten Dunst
was second.)</LD>
<LD>   Beyond the doormen (who resembled well-dressed sumo wrestlers), a
waitress offers tall glasses of clear liquid. "It's called a Lucky
Guess," she says. And the ingredients? "I have no idea." One sip
confirms the refreshing nectar contains alcohol--and a lot of it. The
music is loud, but few people venture real conversation anyway. This
crowd is keen on spotting A-listers. Ben Affleck is expected. (He
doesn't show, but Benicio Del Toro, Cameron Diaz and Leonardo
DiCaprio do.)</LD>
<TE>   People crowd into a room of windows overlooking the red carpet to
eat sushi and gawk at the arrivals on this recent Thursday evening.
In a far corner, Leah Santos reads tea leaves for guests. The
55-year-old astrologer is no stranger to Hollywood, but she's of
another era. "Thank God they're finally playing some Led Zeppelin,"
she says. "This reminds me of happy times ... I used to go out with
Jimmy Page at the Rainbow Room."</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the action centers around a large Japanese garden lit by
hanging paper lanterns.</TE>
<TE>   On one end, a small crowd has gathered around a man on a unicycle
who is balancing bowls on his head. At the other, a trio of women,
all wearing low-cut dresses and the same shade of blond hair, cause a
traffic jam near the entrance. Someone says Hugh Hefner has arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "Maxim is very hot right now," a petite woman in red-framed
glasses tells a friend. "At their parties, the quotient of cool dudes
and super vixens is very, very high."</TE>
<TE>   Buying Baubles</TE>
<TE>   to Benefit Women</TE>
<TE>   "It's like Tupperware parties but with a conscience," said Brooke
Shields, as she stood in a friend's Santa Monica home Saturday
afternoon. Around her, several dozen women, including Mimi Rogers and
Rose McGowan, hovered over turquoise and jade jewelry, some clutching
little tubs of sorbet. Others jotted their orders down on clipboards.</TE>
<TE>   The occasion for the gathering of about 200 well-heeled women
(Prada, Manolo) was a jewelry party for charity. The women spent
about $23,000 on baubles made by Hands of Change, a local nonprofit.
The profits will benefit programs that aim to improve the economic
condition of women in developing countries.</TE>
<TE>   Shields, the organization's celebrity, was wearing her own
creation, a chunky red necklace named Brooke. She smiled, and hugged
Shatari Davis, 18, one of the jewelry makers. "You can buy all this
jewelry and never experience buyer's remorse."</TE>
<TE>   Playing the Client and Agent Game</TE>
<TE>   In Chapter 1, "The Water Is Filled With Sharks," former Hollywood
agent Nancy Rainford poses the questions that run through her book:
"Trust your agent? Can you? Should you?"</TE>
<TE>   "How to Agent Your Agent" (Lone Eagle; due in June) is a self-help
book of the Hollywood kind: part advice, part industry guide, with a
dose of dish.</TE>
<TE>   In conversation, Rainford is not exactly charitable when it comes
to describing agents: "Sharks and lawyer types."</TE>
<TE>   Rainford, whose clients have included Jada Pinkett-Smith, Adam
Goldberg and Ray Liotta, offers tips to actors and writers on how to
squeeze more work from an agent, including "always appear to be busy"
and "take credit when you can." Both, she says, will keep the agent
motivated. "You have to cajole your agent to work harder for you,"
she says, adding that not every agent in the industry has understood
the importance of what she calls the "three Ss: Sign, Sell and
Service."</TE>
<TE>   Rainford also describes how an agent might seduce--in the best
Sammy Glick style--a prospective client. Once the target is
identified, the agent will stay close. At first, the agent on the
prowl will be pleasant and fun to be around, she says. Then comes the
agent's full-bore schmooze: presents, invitations to parties and ball
games. "Eventually, you [the agent] go in and plant the seeds of
doubt," Rainford says. "You throw out a line [like] 'There's a lead
in a movie that's perfect for you--big director, big studio movie.'"
That the movie may already be cast won't matter. "It makes the actor
think, 'How come I'm not getting these opportunities?' If it happens
often enough, the actor will start doubting their own agent," and
that's when the new agent can move in for the kill. [Theme to "Jaws"
goes here.]</TE>

<LD>ME AND SHAKESPEARE</LD>
<LD>   Adventures With the Bard</LD>
<LD>   By Herman Gollob</LD>
<TE>   Doubleday</TE>
<TE>   344 Pages, $26</TE>
<TE>   Herman Gollob served as a book editor for 31/2 decades before
leaving what had been a rewarding occupation. "A certain weariness
had begun to overtake me. In fact, I'd begun to resemble my
briefcase: outside, battered and worn; inside, musty and cluttered,"
he writes in "Me and Shakespeare," his memoiristic account of the six
years following this retirement when he indulged his all-consuming
interest in things Shakespearean.</TE>
<TE>   Gollob's intrigue was reignited by an astounding production of
"Hamlet" on Broadway starring Ralph Fiennes. With time on his hands
and a curious mind sparked by this production, the septuagenarian
Gollob delved into the works of Shakespeare with all the passion he'd
brought to book editing at Little, Brown and other publishing houses.</TE>
<TE>   In the bard's masterpieces, he discovered a quality similar to
that he'd encountered years earlier when he'd returned to his Jewish
roots and had a bar mitzvah in his 50s. "I felt I was sharing some
kind of mystery, that I was being drawn in by a spiritual quality,"
he writes, "that I was being transformed and lifted out of reality
into something deeper and more profound."</TE>
<TE>   "Me and Shakespeare" takes readers chronologically through his
budding interest, into the many courses, lectures, books and research
he mines, to discussions he has with great actors and directors of
Shakespearean drama (including David Suchet and Cicely Berry), into
the classes on Shakespeare he teaches to adult students and, finally,
to a stunning production of "Hamlet" at the reconstructed Globe
Theatre in London. Recounting his growing obsession with passionate
writing and a proselyte's enthusiasm, Gollob also casts many backward
glances to his youth, his college-aged aspirations to acting, his
earlier career as a theatrical and literary agent and his
book-editing experiences.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting narrative is nearly impossible to categorize. It's
not clearly a memoir of his expedition into all things Shakespearean,
though the memoirist lens is often used to examine his growing ardor;
it's not entirely a text to help readers get the most out of their
own reading of Shakespeare, though it shifts regularly into that
didactic mode; it's not a scholarly dissertation on a specific aspect
of Shakespearean drama, even if at times it reads as such
(particularly as Gollob researches his own theory that Shakespeare
was inspired by a Jewish acquaintance and that Shakespeare's works,
particularly "King Lear," were influenced by Hebrew theology); nor is
it a memoir of how his upbringing and early career choices influenced
his later appreciation of Shakespeare, though it contains these
elements as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and Shakespeare" is a sprawl covering all these subjects and
then some, slipping in tone throughout--declaiming scholar one
moment, confiding autobiographer the next--and, though filled with
great eagerness, is not particularly adept at inspiring the same
enthusiasm in readers.</TE>
<TE>   Those not as well versed in Shakespearean drama as the author, for
instance, may find themselves lost amid the esoteric details he
discusses with few contextual clues to completely understand his
references. He does provide a stunning account of the Globe's
"Hamlet" filled with important plot details and a concise overview of
the play, but not until the final pages of the book, too late for
many of the earlier references to have made total sense to a
neophyte.</TE>
<TE>   Gollob delves regularly into highlights of his editing career with
only the slimmest fiber to tie these stories to the subject at
hand--usually, that a particular writer or co-worker reminds him of a
Shakespearean character.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Gollob shuffles between the tragedies and comedies,
following his own random research path, along with the syllabus of
the class he teaches at an adult education institute in New Jersey,
weaving in stories of his childhood and early adulthood and
assembling these disparate tales upon a structural scaffolding built
of whim and happenstance.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, his obsession with Shakespeare remains his own,
with little room for the reader unless that reader is already
similarly fascinated. This is most apparent when Gollob writes of
taking a three-week summer course at Oxford and recounts in
painstaking degree his every conversation with the instructor, the
research he unearths for the optional end-of-class paper, even
quoting whole-cloth sections of his final paper for the reader's
edification.</TE>
<TE>   In an emblematic scene, Gollob explains that the instructor has
asked class members to keep their final presentations to 15 minutes,
but Gollob decides his paper, which cannot be delivered in less than
half an hour, deserves the class' attention and proceeds to usurp it.
"Taking a seat facing the class, I sensed how it would feel to defend
a doctoral thesis," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt readers who share his extreme fascination with
Shakespeare will find in this narrative fuel to keep that fire
burning. For the uninitiated, though, the book becomes little more
than a rambling lesson in self-indulgence. Considering the author's
many years as a book editor, where part of the job is to rein in the
egocentrism that can creep into manuscripts, a saying comes to mind:
"Physician, heal thyself."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--Will HBO's saucy "Sex and the City" have to change its name
to "Sex and the Kiddie?"</LD>
<LD>   Apparently not.</LD>
<LD>   News of star Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy--she is expecting a
baby with husband Matthew Broderick in early fall--had fans wondering
if lovesickness would be replaced by morning sickness in the show's
once smoldering story line.</LD>
<TE>   Initially, HBO, was, er, mum on the subject, but a spokeswoman
announced last week that Parker's "pregnancy will not be a story
line." The show's production, which had been suspended on April 10
for four weeks because of the pregnancy, is expected to resume May 6,
and the airdate has been moved to July from June.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is speculation about how the diminutive Parker, 37,
playing freewheeling sex columnist and fashion plate Carrie Bradshaw
will reconcile her high-living and high-fashion profile with a
growing belly.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the show's writers plan to disguise the obvious and opt
for a Julia Louis-Dreyfus solution to pregnancy (the "Seinfeld" star
carried shopping bags and gift boxes to camouflage her belly). Maybe
they'll dismiss it altogether a la Jane Leeves in "Frasier," whose
obviously burgeoning belly was chalked up to weight gain.</TE>
<TE>   Postings on a "Sex and the City" Web site offer support for the
star but pose the fashion problem many are pondering. One fan wrote,
"I think it's great! She's really going to look cute being pregnant,
but it's really gonna put a 'kink' in some of those strange outfits
she wears."</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention the cramp in her footwear. Pregnancy and sky-high
stilettos don't seem like sole mates, but as Carrie Bradshaw, Parker
seems more committed to her size 61/2 Manolo Blahniks than to her
relationships with men. It's as difficult to imagine Bradshaw
shelving her shoes as it is to think of her trading in her Cosmos for
beakers of milk. Are there Birkenstocks in her future?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my God, no," exclaims Cindy Weber Cleary, the fashion news
director of InStyle magazine. "I wouldn't put her in a towering high
heel, but a beautiful high-stacked heel will distribute her weight."</TE>
<TE>   The folks at Manolo say it will be shoe business as usual. "She's
such a small girl to begin with that she can wear high-heeled
stilettos until the end of the pregnancy," predicts company president
George Malkemus.</TE>
<TE>   "Your feet change a lot during pregnancy, and if you accommodate
that change by wearing flats, you might not be able to get into your
shoes again. I think Sarah will take the Chinese binding approach."
But if she doesn't or can't, says Malkemus, "she can wear our kitten
heels or mules." The company would even design a special maternity
shoe for the actress, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers of maternity clothes also are clambering to give
Parker, whom Steven Cojocaru, People magazine's West Coast style
editor, calls "America's fashion muse," anything she wants. "This is
a woman who is completely fashionable and doesn't want to compromise
her style just because she's expecting," says Carrie Estok, a
spokeswoman for A Pea in the Pod maternity boutiques. She can picture
the actress in a pair of trendy Seven jeans with a built-in
underbelly band and a teal silk chiffon one-shouldered blouse. "She's
going to look fabulous in that," Estok gushes.</TE>
<TE>   At L'Attesa, another maternity clothing company, spokeswoman Jill
Blau says, "I called her publicist and told her that we would love to
come and do a personal fitting and design special things for her that
no one else has." Blau envisions Parker in the company's halter
sweater top, Gucci-like lace pants, Chloe-like capris and Prada-like
wrap blouses.</TE>
<TE>   But "like" it or not, maternity wear manufacturers will have to
get in line behind the real deals. Top designers, such as Roberto
Cavalli, whose luxury fabrics and sizzling wife-of-the-rock-star
styling were immortalized in one episode of the show, are virtually
frothing to take Parker on as a pregnant client. "Sarah Jessica will
be more beautiful than ever, and she will look more chic and elegant
than ever," says the Italian designer. "She is a woman with a strong
personality, and with the pregnancy she will give a special twist to
her look. I can't wait to create a special wardrobe for her."</TE>
<TE>   And at least one observer of pop culture thinks the move to hide
the pregnancy is the way to go.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Thompson, a professor of media and popular culture at
Syracuse University says, "So many people tune in for that one
half-hour fantasy that makes them think about if they hadn't gotten
married, didn't have a baby, didn't own a snow blower."</TE>

<LD>Be Specific!</LD>
<LD>   What makes a story good? It's the use of specific information.
Think about the story of "Little Red Riding Hood." What if it just
said the big bad wolf was scary? Scary is a general word. Many things
can be scary. Instead, the story tells us the wolf has sharp, white
teeth. It is the detail of the teeth that finally scares Red Riding
Hood and sends her running out the door.</LD>
<LD>   In the story of "The Three Little Pigs," there is another wolf.
What we remember about him are the details of what he did. He did not
merely scare the pigs. "He huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the
house down." As readers, we can hear each huff and each puff. Would
the story be just as scary if it said: "The wolf chased the pigs. The
pigs ran away." What's missing? The details, of course!</LD>
<TE>   So the next time you write something, be sure to use specific
details. Don't just say you were happy. Write about how you couldn't
stop smiling. Describe how you were so happy that you did something
nice for your brother or sister or helped your mother with the
dishes. If you want to say the room smelled nice, try saying it
smelled like buttered popcorn, or chicken cooking for dinner, or of
roses. If you hear a noise, say what it is. Is it the sound of a baby
crying softly? Or a song on a radio? Which song? Perhaps it is the
sound of laughing. Or arguing. Or of people cheering for a baseball
game at the park. "Way to go, Luisa!" they yell.</TE>
<TE>   When you write a story, remember the details and write down as
many as possible before you begin. Use those details when you write
so your readers can see, hear, smell, taste and feel what you did. Be
specific!</TE>
<TE>   Tune in to the KLCS-produced Homework Hotline on Wednesday from
4:30 to 5:30 p.m. to discover more about making your writing come
alive with details. You can also call 1-800-LA STUDY to get answers

<HD>One Week of Life Outside the Box</HD>
<DH>The Chastangs turn off their four TVs and learn the value
of time without movies and the Lakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You think cozying up to a "Fear Factor" bucket of worms would be
tough? You think being stranded on a tropical island full of
neurotic, lying backstabbers would be tougher?</LD>
<LD>   Those are nothing compared to this reality show: two adults and
two kids living in the heart of TV land where the only rule is no
television for a week. This in a society in which 98% of households
have a television set and the TV is on an average of nearly eight
hours a day.</LD>
<LD>   Inspired by National TV-Turnoff Week last week, the Chastangs of
Eagle Rock boldly went where many parents dream of, but few ever go.
They pulled the plug on their household's four television sets, which
range from a 6-inch portable to the 25-inch set in their living room.
And for good measure, they banned videos, computer games and Internet
surfing as well.</LD>
<TE>   They didn't do it for money, prizes or fame. They did it to remind
themselves there's a life of the mind, a life with each other, a life
outside the box.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids would watch television all the time if they could," says
Catherine, a stay-at-home mom with a part-time scrapbooking business
and the force behind the weeklong experiment. "A week with no TV is
extreme for us, but I've been preparing them."</TE>
<TE>   Though each family member--parents Richard and Catherine, kids
Angelica, 7, and Michelle, 5, who goes by the nickname Mimi--has his
or her own particular weakness when it comes to the small screen,
their collective crunch time seems to be in the late afternoon (after
homework is finished) and early evenings (before the nightly ritual
of bath, reading and bedtime). So in those hours each weekday, the
family allowed The Times to watch them not watch TV.</TE>
<TE>   Day 1</TE>
<TE>   Like dieting, the idea is always easier than the reality. And like
a diet, the first day always seems to be the hardest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been roughest on Mimi," Catherine says. It's not television
shows that she misses so much as her favorite videotapes: "Atlantis:
The Lost Empire" and "Cinderella II."</TE>
<TE>   But, Catherine quickly adds, "It's been tough on me, too."</TE>
<TE>   The first hours of deprivation remind Mom of a key benefit of TV.
It's a reliable stopgap baby-sitter. "I couldn't even have a phone
conversation today," Catherine says. "Mimi really demanded my
attention all day."</TE>
<TE>   The youngest Chastang attends preschool each morning until shortly
after 10. After that, it's up to Catherine's patience and ingenuity
to keep up with Mimi, a bright, animated youngster in pigtails. After
2:30, Mom must also handle Angelica when her second-grade class lets
out. Both kids are well-mannered and have no trouble concentrating
but are still kids who seem to run on the Energizer Bunny's
batteries.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine is pretty much on her own today. Richard, an attorney
with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, is on business on the
East Coast and isn't expected home until close to the girls' bedtime,
around 8.</TE>
<TE>   It's not even 6 p.m. and the girls have already worn Barbie
out--the doll has changed clothes, residences and party scenes
several times over. Later, Angelica makes a bead bracelet, and Mimi
practices her lowercase and uppercase letters with an alphabet
puzzle. The girls then play a spontaneous game of keep the balloon
from hitting the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's walk the dog," Mom suggests. "We have some time to kill."</TE>
<TE>   Catherine takes Ginger, a frisky 1-year-old German shepherd mix
from the pound. Mimi takes her scooter and Angelica walks. The brief
hike takes them through the streets of their quiet hilltop
neighborhood and onto a few off-road paths, where they get excited
about spotting a small snake.</TE>
<TE>   There's still about an hour left before bath time, around 7 p.m.
It's game time. Mimi votes for "Anastasia," a game they haven't
played in months. In 10 minutes, the game is over. They play again.</TE>
<TE>   Like many preschoolers, Mimi loves repetition.</TE>
<TE>   Want to play again? she asks.</TE>
<TE>   No, Mom says.</TE>
<TE>   Please?!</TE>
<TE>   No. How about Chutes and Ladders?</TE>
<TE>   Yeah! Angelica agrees.</TE>
<TE>   It is a conversation the family will repeat in some form dozens of
times during the week, with only slight variations in the suggestion
of games.</TE>
<TE>   Before anyone can climb up a ladder or slide down a chute, Mimi
exercises her considerable veto power and pulls out a Dr. Seuss
trivia game. In unloading the game, Mimi accidentally spills dozens
of cards on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Another benefit of television, points out Catherine surveying the
fallen cards and myriad other games spread out across the family room
floor: "It's not messy."</TE>
<TE>   Day 2</TE>
<TE>   The dog days of a home with darkened screens are already upon the
Chastangs. Angelica, who enjoys TV and videos as much as the next
kid, greatly misses the CD-ROM art program that allows her to lay out
and design text and photos.</TE>
<TE>   Mimi misses the computer game "Madeline" and her videos.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine misses the morning news programs she usually watches.</TE>
<TE>   But of them all, it's Richard who most needs to plop down in front
of the television. He's still jet-lagged from his trip, and he worked
all day. Also, his favorite show, "24," a real-time thriller starring
Kiefer Sutherland, airs tonight. And then, there's the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to take not watching the playoffs," he says, noting the
next game isn't until Thursday. "It's early, but I'm confident the
Lakers will make it past the first round."</TE>
<TE>   During dinner, Mimi volunteers with a smile that she tried to get
the baby-sitter to turn on the television. The ruse didn't work. The
baby-sitter had been forewarned.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, the family settles into another evening of games.
The girls pull out Twister and for the next 20 minutes look like
they're in a commercial for the game. Later, when the games switch to
those not requiring the skills of a contortionist, Catherine and
Richard join in.</TE>
<TE>   Close to bath time, Mimi moves toward the computer and jokes: "I'm
going to turn on the computer."</TE>
<TE>   "You do and you'll have a timeout for the next three days,"
replies Richard with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   Day 3</TE>
<TE>   The kids are becoming more accustomed to a household in which the
only voices heard come from live people. Catherine has a 10-minute
phone conversation without a Mimi interruption. Nobody asks to turn
on the television or the computer today.</TE>
<TE>   "They know they're up against a wall," Catherine says. "Why
bother?"</TE>
<TE>   Homework is getting done. Barbie and friends are going to another
party. And puzzles, long ignored, are getting some hands-on time.</TE>
<TE>   "The house is just calmer with no TV," Catherine says. "The girls
don't fight as much, either." But she admits that she really missed
television after the girls went to bed.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to veg, to relax," she says. "Television zones me out.
It asks nothing of me."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Lakers are still on Richard's mind: "If they sweep,
I haven't missed much. But if it goes next week, I'll still catch the
deciding game."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Catherine makes a steak dinner and leaves for a business
meeting around 5:30, so Richard has the girls. At dinner, Mimi
provides an uninterrupted five-minute plot synopsis of Disney's
"Atlantis."</TE>
<TE>   "Mimi can narrate a long story," Richard smiles.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, the girls persuade their father to play a new game
called Cadoo, a fun mix of tick-tack-toe, charades, Pictionary and
clay sculpting. Before the game is over, Angelica draws a school bus
that to Mimi looks like a television.</TE>
<TE>   "It's on her subconscious," Richard says.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, Richard and the girls take Ginger for a walk. Both
girls are on scooters tonight and keep a half-block lead on their
father and Ginger. As the walk ends, the girls take off their helmets
and dance around a neighbor's lawn sprinklers. It's a good transition
to bath time.</TE>
<TE>   Day 4</TE>
<TE>   The withdrawal pains are back. Today, Catherine has to explain to
Mimi three times exactly when the television can go back on and why.
Angelica says the first videos she wants to watch on Monday are
"Peter Pan" and "Pocahontas."</TE>
<TE>   Richard admits to almost straying the previous night after the
girls were in bed. "I almost had a moment of weakness," he says,
about the same time the Lakers were playing the Trail Blazers. "The
kids went to bed early, I'd finished reading everything I could, and
time was dragging. I thought, 'Hey, who is going to know?' But I
figured we had a goal, and if the kids can do it, so can I."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, before Richard gets home, the girls help Catherine paint
a small treasure box as a thank you to a family friend for hosting a
tea party. Angelica insists everyone wear aprons.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never painted a box before," says Angelica, as she applies
beige paint.</TE>
<TE>   After a ravioli dinner, the night's main event is the family's new
favorite game, "Cadoo." It supplies what it promises: creative fun
and laughs.</TE>
<TE>   Day 5</TE>
<TE>   The bomb drops.</TE>
<TE>   "I accidentally watched TV," Mimi tells her mother.</TE>
<TE>   On Fridays, Mimi is in day care in the afternoon. Day care hadn't
been informed of the TV embargo.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't think of it," Catherine says. "TV is everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Then, she turns to her daughter, wearing an impish grin. "Did you
think to tell [day care] that you weren't supposed to watch TV?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," Mimi says, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   According to Mimi, the dive back into television wasn't that
satisfying. She said one of the shows seemed to be about vampires and
the other was "like Aladdin" but wasn't. Also, the sound wasn't
working.</TE>
<TE>   The lapse, which is taken in stride by the family, doesn't end the
experiment. The family is determined to finish out the week. But
Mimi's straying prompts Catherine to admit that the night before she
"really, really wanted to turn on the television, just to see what's
happening in the world." She resisted, and like other nights when the
television wasn't on, she went to sleep around 9:30, about 90 minutes
earlier than usual.</TE>
<TE>   The day has been unusual, too, because of the responses Catherine
receives from a survey of Angelica's elementary school. Less than a
week ago, Catherine addressed 400 students urging them to join her
family in their TV-less experiment. The parents of 66 kids filled out
a survey of interest, a majority of those were supportive and
positive.</TE>
<TE>   But some were not. One first-grader's parent wrote that Catherine
should confine her "stupid social engineering" ideas within school
walls and away from his home. Another parent offered this
non-sequitur excuse: Banning TV might disrupt their child's "balanced
diet."</TE>
<TE>   Richard and Catherine are taken aback by some of the comments but
are able to laugh them off.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in all, the week has been a success, and the family decides
to go out to dinner to celebrate. They enjoy another night of family
conversation, browse a bookstore afterward and head home to bed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been an exhausting week," Catherine says.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend/Epilogue</TE>
<TE>   The weekend is filled with family activity. Gymnastics, birthday
parties and an art benefit consume much of their time. The TV remains
off. The same can't be said for the computer. Richard points out on
Sunday that technically it wouldn't violate the original agreement to
check the computer for the Lakers score--so long as there's no
Internet surfing. All parties concur and Richard discovers to his
delight the Lakers have swept the series.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday morning, when the week of TV deprivation officially
ends, there's something of a surprise. The TV remains off.</TE>
<TE>   "This was wonderful; we are so grateful we did this," Catherine
says. "Having the television off stretches you and makes you reach
within yourself. We really have to consider if we want to invite that
invader back into our house," she says.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Mimi isn't back from preschool yet.</TE>

<HD>Contacting the Dead? It's Become a Lively Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 12 years of not hearing from my dad, I was starting to get
worried. I mean, just because he's been dead the whole time doesn't
mean he can't stay in touch. With so many talented psychics running
around, including several who have their own TV shows, the lines of
communication should be wide open.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, even though my job as a journalist has required me
to interview psychic dogs, psychic humans and the occasional Magic 8
Ball, my father's spirit has never materialized. Until now.</LD>
<LD>   The breakthrough happened earlier this month at a summit of
"after-death communicators." Actually, the summit was a flop. At the
last minute, well-known medium James Van Praagh backed out because
"Entertainment Tonight" needed him to contact actor Robert Blake's
slain wife. And a University of Arizona professor who researches
psychic phenomena was too ill to fly from Tucson.</LD>
<TE>   Hmm. Guess the spirits didn't see that coming.</TE>
<TE>   But that still left Judy Guggenheim, co-author of "Hello From
Heaven!," and George Dalzell, a psychiatric social worker from the
L.A. County Department of Mental Health. By day, Dalzell tries to
help homeless people get the voices out of their heads, but at night,
he tunes into such voices--from the spirit realm.</TE>
<TE>   Dalzell has written a book, "Messages," outlining a string of
bizarre encounters with the ghost of his dead lover Michael Keller,
who apparently is quite a prankster in the hereafter. Keller's
friends and relatives say his ghost disrupts phone calls, flicks
lights on and off, arranges rose petals into patterns and sets off
alarm clocks at odd hours. About the only thing his spirit hasn't
done is phone next-of-kin to ask if their refrigerator is running.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Friday, I visited Dalzell and Guggenheim at Dalzell's
apartment in Larchmont. The purpose of the summit, they said, was to
urge scientific research into the possibility of life after death.</TE>
<TE>   Now is the time, they said, noting a harmonic convergence of TV
shows and books on the topic, including Arizona professor Gary E.
Schwartz's controversial research into the paranormal.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the technology to settle this question once and for all,"
Guggenheim said. "Let's go to the lab with it."</TE>
<TE>   OK, but first, let's run a little experiment in Larchmont. "Will
you give me a reading?" I asked Dalzell. Although caught off guard,
he was a good sport and agreed to try his skills on a skeptical
reporter.</TE>
<TE>   I used to believe in all of this stuff. Growing up, I was
entranced by reports of psychic phenomena. Then, in high school,
somebody gave me "Dunninger's Complete Encyclopedia of Magic," which
explained how magicians perform similar feats. Some of the stunts
were incredibly elaborate, but they were tricks, nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean I reject the idea of life after death. Quite the
opposite. I just don't think it's possible to chat with someone after
they're gone. The few psychics and mediums who've been brave enough
to undergo scientific testing have invariably flunked. And the rest
probably would flunk.</TE>
<TE>   On a St. Louis radio show a few years ago, a caller asked Van
Praagh about a dead brother. After the mustachioed medium conjured up
a hospital scene and described how "the cancer came quickly over his
body," the caller revealed there was no dead brother. Even when
callers aren't setting traps, transcripts of readings by Van Praagh,
John Edward and other mediums show a staggering number of misses.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, I wrote about Harmony Grove, a spiritualist village north
of San Diego. A hundred years ago, spiritualist mediums enjoyed a
wide following. Then, after prominent practitioners were exposed as
fakes, the church fell from grace, but it never died out completely.
Today's spiritualists acknowledge some shenanigans in the past, but
insist contact with the dead is real.</TE>
<TE>   So I went to a seance. It was a few weeks after my father died and
I figured if this stuff were legit, someone would pick up on my dad's
departure. Nope. My other journalistic encounters with psychics--both
human and canine--have been equally unpersuasive. Therefore, I wasn't
expecting much as Dalzell began my reading:</TE>
<TE>   I'm getting a Janice or Janet that you're close to.</TE>
<TE>   No, sorry.</TE>
<TE>   There's a J name.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, that narrows it down: John, Joe, Jennifer, Jim, Jessica,
Jean, Jeff, Jill, Jane, Jerry. (Ever notice how talking with the dead
is like watching "Wheel of Fortune"? The spirits can only speak in
consonants until it's time to deliver the final message and then
suddenly they're able to blurt out entire paragraphs: "Your
grandmother says she loves you, she's proud of you, she likes your
new wallpaper and she's enjoying heaven with your grandpa and your
dog Spot.")</TE>
<TE>   I'm getting another Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there's another Roy. (But that's a pretty safe bet. Parents
often name their kids after other people, and Roy is an uncommon
first name.)</TE>
<TE>   Are you a Roy Jr.?</TE>
<TE>   Sort of. (My middle name is different, but close enough.)</TE>
<TE>   They're telling me about a potential drowning. I'm wondering if
you have a younger brother who was in some kind of water accident?</TE>
<TE>   I don't have a brother.</TE>
<TE>   A younger sibling in an accident?</TE>
<TE>   No.</TE>
<TE>   Were you in a potential drowning between ages 7 and 12?</TE>
<TE>   No. And who is the "they" telling you this?</TE>
<TE>   It's whomever in the spirit world is trying to communicate with
you.</TE>
<TE>   (After Dalzell finds out my dad is deceased, the "they" suddenly
becomes my dad).</TE>
<TE>   Are there Baptists with your family? Was there a lot of zealotry
in your upbringing?</TE>
<TE>   Not unless you consider Episcopalians zealots.</TE>
<TE>   Was your father a war veteran?</TE>
<TE>   Yes.</TE>
<TE>   He's talking about a battlefield. Was he in the infantry?</TE>
<TE>   No, he was in the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Do you have a dental appointment coming up?</TE>
<TE>   No.</TE>
<TE>   Did you have one within the last month?</TE>
<TE>   No.</TE>
<TE>   Is there anyone in your family with a dentist appointment?</TE>
<TE>   Well, considering we all get checkups every six months, I'm sure
someone is due.</TE>
<TE>   Does your family have a connection to a hospital, perhaps the
naming of a hospital wing?</TE>
<TE>   No.</TE>
<TE>   Did someone work in a hospital?</TE>
<TE>   Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Was your mom an R.N.?</TE>
<TE>   Yes.</TE>
<TE>   And so it went. A handful of hits, usually after a series of
leading questions, and a multitude of misses.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when Dalzell was preparing to give me the phone number of
the Arizona professor who was too sick to attend the summit, I
readied my pen and said, "OK, 520 area code."</TE>
<TE>   Dalzell blinked and asked: "You're from Tucson?"</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up there," I said. "Didn't my dad tell you?"</TE>
<TE>   Dalzell insists his readings are usually more on target. He urged
me to call Sheila Lowe, author of "The Complete Idiot's Guide to
Handwriting Analysis," to ask about a session he did with her.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe, whose 27-year-old daughter was killed two years ago, has
visited six psychics since the slaying. "They were all very good,"
she said. Dalzell's hits included the name Eric (her son), the name
Joseph (the last name of a man who had visited Lowe's house the day
of the reading), the style of shoes her daughter liked, and the
presence of Spanish blood in the family. "I had just been researching
my family's genealogy and found a relative from Gibraltar," Lowe
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   When asked why she has shelled out money for so many mediums, Lowe
said, "Because you just want to hear more. It's never enough, no
matter how good it is."</TE>
<TE>   Based on notes she took during Dalzell's reading, she rated him
"at least 80% right." But when Dalzell conducted a reading for
Unfacts .org, a skeptics' Web site, his accuracy plunged to 14%,
roughly the same level he had with me.</TE>
<TE>   Why the discrepancy? My theory is that it's a twist on the old
maxim "Seeing is believing." Sometimes the reverse is true:
"Believing is seeing." If someone wants to contact a dead loved one
badly enough, he's going to look for--and probably find--evidence
that such communication happened. Especially when a psychic spouts
vague, fill-in-the-blank messages. Another factor: People tend to
remember hits more than misses.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, I readily admit that some of the psychic tales I've
heard over the years appear to defy explanation. But it seems
whenever the principals are subjected to scientific scrutiny, their
purported paranormal powers mysteriously vanish.</TE>
<TE>   Magician James Randi has offered $1 million to anyone who can
demonstrate supernatural abilities under cheat-proof conditions.
Dalzell dismissed Randi's challenge, saying the magician is
untrustworthy. But Randi says a third party would run the experiment
(under test conditions approved by both sides) and the results would
be made public.</TE>
<TE>   One area that might be difficult to verify is a description of the
afterlife. For example, most mediums claim the hereafter doesn't
include a hell. I'm not so sure. Does anyone seriously believe that
God would allow Hitler, Jeffrey Dahmer and the person who wrote the
"Macarena" song to enter paradise?</TE>
<TE>   Afterlife dining is another conundrum. In 1998, Newsweek noticed
Van Praagh telling a TV audience that spirits don't eat food, then
moments later informing a woman that her dead mother was able to dine
again in heaven and was cooking for other spirits.</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, no one in the "after-death community" seems troubled
by such contradictions. Dalzell said he's reluctant to challenge any
of his colleagues' veracity for fear of being sued. But would these
people actually risk having their psychic powers tested in a court of
law?</TE>
<TE>   Wait, I'm getting a message. I don't know if it's my dad, but some
sort of spirit is telling me: not a chance.</TE>

<HD>After Pause, a Couple Reconcile Their Aims</HD>
<DH>Marriage* In writing of how a year apart from her husband
renewed their relationship, Joan Anderson has struck a chord with
women.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last line of Joan Anderson's new book sums it up. She
congratulates her husband on their anniversary: "I can't believe
it--thirty two years with the same person!" He replies: "That's just
it. We're not the same person."</LD>
<LD>   The saga of this couple's marital transformation--which is really
the wife's version of what happened--is told in two slim memoirs, the
second just published.</LD>
<LD>   "An Unfinished Marriage" (Broadway Books, 2002) picks up where "A
Year by the Sea" (Doubleday, 1999) left off.</LD>
<TE>   In that first volume, Anderson described how she ran away from
home for a year at 50, when her children were grown, her marriage
stale, and her husband announced they were moving to be near a new
job he had just taken. He simply assumed she would come along. She
wouldn't. Instead, she decided to move to their Cape Cod summer
cottage. He could live his new life without her.</TE>
<TE>   Given the 57% divorce rate in the United States, this is probably
not an unusual story. And Anderson's privileged escape--to a
beautiful spot that they owned free and clear--was an elitist form of
conjugal noncompliance. In fact, some thought Anderson's mission to
separate herself had the earmarks of a wilted New Age soap opera.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-seven publishers rejected it. Even Doubleday, which
eventually bought the manuscript, showed little enthusiasm for it,
she says. "It was a B-list book. No ads or promotions were done for
it," and so few copies were printed that it had sold out at
bookstores by the time "Oprah" and the "Today" show got wind of the
book's word-of-mouth success and invited its author to appear. Even
so, the publisher declined to print a paperback version.</TE>
<TE>   Another publisher, Broadway Books, printed 250,000 copies in
paperback--all of which sold quickly. It appears that relatively
affluent women across the country had been searching for some sort of
learning tool through which they, too, could enhance their marriages
without resorting to counselors or courts. About 3,000 of the
paperbacks "walked off the shelves" at Once Upon a Time, a small
independent bookstore in Montrose. Says shop manager Charlotte
Hollingsworth: "We got the book in hardcover first, passed it around,
and everybody loved it." Readers began considering the possibility of
taking time off by themselves, if only for a weekend, to figure out
what was right and wrong with their married lives. "I sent the author
a note saying how great the book is, and if you ever do a tour, we'd
love to meet you." The "we" she refers to are her mostly married,
mostly well-educated customers from La Canada, La Crescenta and
Montrose--quietly upscale residential enclaves not far from Pasadena
and downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   When Anderson's second volume, "An Unfinished Marriage," hit
stores this month, about 70 of the shop's customers paid $70 each for
a seminar, arranged by Hollingsworth (with proceeds to charity),
where Anderson signed autographs and shared her wisdom. The youngest
in the audience was 26 and not married but determined "to be
successful" when she does tie the knot. The oldest, a married woman
in her late 70s, said she was there "because it's never too late to
learn."</TE>
<TE>   The new book tells how the author and her husband reunited at the
Cape Cod house, and restored their relationship in much the same
fashion as one might repair a lovely but ravaged antique. Slowly,
gently and with care not to chip fragile surfaces, they revived their
union to a semblance of what it once had been--with obvious
exceptions made for wear, tear and increased age. The author--now a
minor celebrity who leads seaside "retreats" for women on Cape
Cod--has just been on "Oprah" again and has finished a 10-city book
promotion tour.</TE>
<TE>   Why such popularity? It was all so accidental, Anderson said
recently while in Los Angeles to promote the book. She never intended
to run away from home, certainly not to write about it. She never
could have imagined that her private relationship (or lack of it)
with her husband of 25 years would resonate with so many women of
such diverse ages. In retrospect, she says, she realizes that
marriage is a suppressed hot-button issue in America, one that few
people are addressing in a constructive way, she says.</TE>
<TE>   She believes it is a particular problem with middle-class women
like herself, whose plight is not tragic in any way. "Our life was
good. My husband was good--a dutiful, responsible, hard-working
person." They'd met at Yale drama school, spent three years in Africa
in the Peace Corps together, married there--and then came home to
"live the American dream," she says. He was a school administrator.
She was a writer of children's books and freelance features who also
raised the kids, ran the house and arranged the family's social
calendar. "Exactly what most working wives do these days," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "But while we were raising the kids and building our careers, we
lost each other. Perhaps we were making strides independently--but
certainly not together. Suddenly we turned around and the kids were
grown," and the marriage was dull. "No fun, no passion. We were
friends, but we were stale. We had a daily routine, but that was
about it." At times like that, she says, many couples believe they
don't love each other any more. "Absolutely at one point I thought I
didn't love my husband." And he wasn't particularly thrilled with
her. "He once said to me--and I'm sure most women have had this said
to them at least once--'I don't even know if I love you. Or if I've
ever loved you. I don't know what love is.'"</TE>
<TE>   Many couples reach this stage and call a lawyer to discuss divorce
or trial separation. But because their crisis was so sudden--and
because her husband was focused on his new job, not on obtaining his
freedom--each left for separate destinations. She was quite
Garboesque about it. She wasn't leaving him, she said; she simply
wanted to be alone. And for one year, she was. She walked the beach,
swam with seals, made friends with neighbor Joan Erikson, widow of
psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, who taught her quite a few things. She
rediscovered who she was, who she wanted to become in relation to the
man she loved. She had no idea if her goals were still compatible
with those of her husband. But she would soon find out. He announced
he was leaving his new job, retiring and joining her at the beach. He
didn't have to ask permission; his parents had given them the house.</TE>
<TE>   The details of his return, and of their new merger, are
quintessentially banal. But so is the essence of everyday life,
especially when shared by two people in a small, summerhouse space.
He rearranges the kitchen without asking; she can't find a thing. He
has his office furniture shipped; it's too big and ugly for the
little house. He puts his arm around her as they head to town for a
movie. She rushes forward, out of his embrace, as if getting to the
movie is more important than that moment. "Why did I run away from
that touch? That touch is worth as much as a night of making love. In
fact, it is a way of making love."</TE>
<TE>   The revelations are small and continuous--echoes of what she
discovered about herself when she was alone. She realizes she has
been both too deferential and too bossy in her married life.
Deferential in areas where she could have asserted individuality,
with no harm to the relationship. And bossy in those small, homey
areas where women are used to exerting control, and in the process
often humiliate their mates.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided I would not instruct him in anything anymore. That was
not my role. I realized I'd become a total control freak from all
those years of running the house and the kids. Caregivers are usually
the controllers. After years of being the controller, how can a woman
just lie back and enjoy a sensual or sexual life? She can't. She's
always on her guard. He's not gonna do it right, it's not going to be
as perfect as I'd like.... "</TE>
<TE>   This time, she'd reflected enough to understand some very basic
things. The most important was that she had indeed married the right
man. She realized she loved his intellect, his curiosity, the
excitement they'd shared as youngsters about mutual goals and
adventures. She wanted only for them to find their way back to each
other so that they could move forward together. There was no need for
either of them to look elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some marriages must break up, she says. "But in most
cases, I think if there was true love and excitement in the
beginning, then couples can find it with each other again."</TE>

<LD>Mrs. Kim thinks the story about Cinnamon the kitten is true. It
isn't. I made the story up because I once saw a kitten on my way home
from school. I try to open my mouth to tell the truth, but I don't.
Mrs. Kim is staring at me. Maybe if I tell her the truth, she won't
think I did a good job on the story. Maybe she will take away the two
gold stars she gave me. Maybe she won't put my story in the school
newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   "Are you OK, Cristina? You look as though you're going to be
sick," Mrs. Kim says.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe Mrs. Kim will think badly of me. Maybe my green card for
good behavior will change to red for bad. Maybe I will get in trouble
for being a liar. I should tell Mrs. Kim the truth, but I don't.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm fine," I lie again.</TE>
<TE>   The bell rings and we leave the school building. Today it is not
so exciting to walk the 43 steps home from the bus stop.</TE>
<TE>   "How was school today, Cristina?" Mama asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Fine," I lie again! Three lies in one day! I am getting worse! I
want to tell Mama that the day has been terrible. I want to tell her
that Mrs. Kim thought my story about Cinnamon was true and I didn't
tell her the truth!</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow, I promise myself, I will tell the truth.</TE>

<DL>ASBURY PARK, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The Boss played here. Jon Bon Jovi too. Count Basie was born nearby.
And Southside Johnny hails from nearby Ocean Grove.</LD>
<LD>   Year after year, their old haunts--dilapidated houses, gritty
nightclubs and boarded-up amusement rides--draw fans from all over
the world who are looking for the real-life people and places
immortalized in song.</LD>
<LD>   Now, a group of music buffs and Bruce Springsteen fans wants to
establish a "music heritage trail" program that would help shore
communities cash in on the lure of the Stone Pony, Madam Marie's
fortunetelling booth and other quasi-historic sites.</LD>
<TE>   The group recently held an inaugural meeting in hopes of
attracting would-be partners. They believe Asbury Park and Monmouth
County could follow the lead of Liverpool, England, which has forged
a multimillion-dollar trade catering to Beatles fans.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Osbourne, who manages four Beatles-related historic sites
for the National Trust in Liverpool, said more than 600,000 fans
flock to the riverside city annually to pay homage to the roots of
John, Paul, George and Ringo.</TE>

<HD>A Musical Menu With Plenty of Choices</HD>
<DH>The secondary stages and early acts on the main stage at
the Coachella festival offer successful mix of non-rock acts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BALTIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>INDIO</DL>
<LD>Sunday's closing day of the weekend's Coachella festival at the
Empire Polo Field offered a rock-heavy lineup on the main stage, but
the secondary stages and early acts on the main stage provided an
abundance of highlights for those who weren't feeling the rock. As
was the case Saturday, much of the event's success came from its
eclecticism.</LD>
<LD>   Hip-hop was again a big draw, starting with acclaimed MC Mos Def,
who displayed his versatility in an early afternoon appearance on the
main stage. The New York rapper did his own spin on Jay-Z's "Rock
This," interpreting the song in an aggressive style he dubbed "ghetto
rock." Sandwiched around the attitude-laden track were two numbers
with bouncier beats that provided a nice contrast. L.A.'s Dilated
Peoples headlined the second stage and also proved to be a crowd
favorite.</LD>
<LD>   The second stage provided some of Sunday's more noteworthy
performances. Acclaimed Scottish band Belle &amp; Sebastian, which rarely
tours, offered finely crafted pop/folk tunes with a gentle lilt that
echoed back to Nick Drake and Donovan.</LD>
<TE>   The surprise was the buoyancy in the music and the group's stage
presence. Songs such as "Boy With the Arab Strap" featured a healthy
kick under the folky arrangements. And singer Stuart Murdoch
addressed the problem of competing with the noise from the main stage
with an improvised lyric, " ... With the sound of the Foo Fighters
passing by."</TE>
<TE>   That sonic conflict also provided some easy one-liners for the
atmospheric Zero 7, one of whose members quipped, "Would someone
please ask the neighbors to turn it down?" If only the septet's songs
had the same personality as its noisy neighbors, the Prodigy. When
Zero 7's two female vocalists took turns fronting the languid jams,
the sound was effective, particularly during the slow blues drawl of
"Waiting Line." However, the outfit killed its momentum with the
ill-advised "Truth," a lengthy song whose themes felt out of place in
the day's festivities.</TE>
<TE>   Zero 7 could have taken lessons in crowd-pleasing from L.A.'s DJ
Dan, who took the Sahara Tent up a level with a flavorful mix of
percussion and jungle-esque tracks that turned the venue into a large
party. Though not as heralded as many of his European counterparts,
Dan is among the best at working a large crowd. But British DJ Pete
Tong, who mixed his tribal-influenced set with showy gesturing, and
BT, in a rare DJ appearance, met the high standard he set.</TE>
<TE>   Superstar DJ Paul Oakenfold was coming off last year's
disappointing appearance on the main stage, and with the release of
his first studio album imminent, Sunday's set marked an important
point for the DJ. Though he's done a great job of promoting himself,
the time had come for Oakenfold to live up to his reputation, and he
came through with the set everyone knew he had in him, even if they
hadn't seen it in some time.</TE>
<TE>   What raised the performance to a high level was the way he
reinvented himself. Instead of relying on his signature expansive
trance hooks, he showcased his diversity, including a Prince-like
funk block, haunting world music chants that took on a goth quality,
and a segment in which he layered the keyboards with a powerful bass
line.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important, he fed off the energy of the crowd, which
clapped along during the long builds and celebrated his triumphant
performance.</TE>

<HD>Inland Pacific Ably Leaps From 'Swan Lake' to 'Rodeo'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rounding up swans and cowboys, the Inland Pacific Ballet proved
they're at home with their range on a concert that included "Swan
Lake," Act 2, and Agnes de Mille's "Rodeo" Saturday night at Bridges
Auditorium in Claremont.</LD>
<LD>   Steadily gaining a solid reputation, Inland Pacific was coming off
its biggest crowd-pleaser ever, an original one-hour "Little Mermaid"
ballet, which will repeat next season. The company returned to
classic ballets, under the direction of Victoria Koenig, for a
satisfying evening of dance.</LD>
<LD>   A sense of sweeping classicism imbued the lakeside scene from
"Swan Lake," staged by Janek Schergen, after Ivanov. To recorded
Tchaikovsky taken at a fairly brisk pace, the corps established mood
through beautiful carriage; their port de bras was stirring with both
force and delicacy.</LD>
<TE>   Kelly Lamoureux made a statuesque and somewhat remote Odette, ably
partnered by Stanko Milov, a guest from the Pacific Northwest Ballet.
Missing were electric moments of enchantment and fluttery details
that often define the Swan Queen, but Lamoureux showed vulnerability
in the character with a sensitively furrowed brow, an expressive neck
and the occasional meaningful turn of the head. Her strength was in a
brave wingspan, especially in the series of supported scissor jumps
that expanded skyward.</TE>
<TE>   Milov had a few impressive moments in an interpolated variation
using little heard music originally written for the ballet's third
act. Allynne Noelle Stoller stood out for her striking line and
commanding breadth as a Big Swan, while the four Little Swans created
a light, pleasing unison with exacting aplomb.</TE>
<TE>   De Mille's "Rodeo," the quaintly good-natured story of how a
frontier tomboy gets her man, looked fresh and charming, thanks to
staging by Paul Sutherland, coaching from Gemze de Lapp and Oliver
Smith's vibrant sets and costumes.</TE>
<TE>   Laura de Guia, more delicate than the usual scrappy Cowgirl,
managed to make the role her own, slumping in rejection and pluckily
riding the strains of Aaron Copland's taped score. Playing the two
men she chooses from, Eric Ragan (the Champion Roper) was,
appropriately, a good catch only on the surface (pretty, but perhaps
slow), while Steven Voznick (the Head Wrangler) tap-danced his way
winningly into the heroine's heart.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Swan Lake," Act 2, and "Rodeo," Inland Pacific Ballet, repeat May
11, 7:30 p.m., and May 12, 1 p.m. Bridges Auditorium, 450 N. College
Way, Claremont. $16-30. (909) 607-1139.</TE>

<HD>'JAG' Episode Tackles Tribunals</HD>
<DH>The military drama offers a glimpse into cases involving
suspected terrorists after the attacks of Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter how heinous the charge, the accused gets a vigorous defense
and the benefit of the doubt. That tenet of American justice is sure
to be put to the test in the military tribunals for suspected
terrorists that President Bush authorized in the fall after Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's episode of "JAG" offers a sneak peek at how those
tribunals might work. The military drama tries to do justice to the
complexity of the legal challenge ahead, but to keep people from
thinking they have stumbled onto a "Nightline" special by mistake,
there is also smoldering chemistry between the main characters, Harm
(David James Elliott) and Mac (Catherine Bell), plus a little hokey
gunplay.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Judge Advocate General team square off in the first
tribunal stemming from the terrorist attacks: Harm and Mac prosecute
an Al Qaeda big shot (Marc Casabani) accused of plotting the New York
City massacre, while Adm. Chegwidden (John M. Jackson) and Cmdr.
Turner (Scott Lawrence) must defend him.</LD>
<TE>   For the admiral, the case stirs up the same conflicting feelings
many Americans may be wrestling with these days. When the defendant
expresses shock at how hard Chegwidden is working on his behalf, the
admiral responds, "Our way of life entitles you to a fair trial, no
matter how cowardly the act." But when the defendant gloats over the
success of the attacks, the admiral can't resist the urge to lash
out.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has been "very supportive" of the show's efforts to
portray the tribunal process, according to executive producer Donald
Bellisario, and it shows in a script that seems to have the
military's seal of approval. "JAG" envisions that process in a
positive light as firm but fair, and it conveys several of the legal
nuances that can be expected in the proceedings. Designed to
compensate for the "fog of war," for example, the hearsay rules are
more permissive than those governing a U.S. criminal trial. In
tonight's case, a confession obtained under duress at a prison camp
is nearly allowed because the defendant is a Saudi citizen
unprotected by the Bill of Rights, but it gets tossed after careful
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   "JAG" has always worn its patriotism on its neatly pressed sleeve,
but if its version of a tribunal is realistic, there is no shame in
that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "JAG" can be seen at 8 tonight on CBS. The network has rated this
episode TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children under the age of 14).</TE>

<HD>Tempest in Britain's Theater Teapot</HD>
<DH>Stage* The Royal Shakespeare and other companies are in
turmoil as artistic directors exit left and right.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRITTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Last month, a British national newspaper carried a provocative
article about the dissent and deep-seated policy differences tearing
apart the Royal Shakespeare Company. The headline on the article,
from Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream," read: "Lord, What
Fools These Mortals Be!"</LD>
<LD>   The phrase seemed to have the ring of prophecy last week as Adrian
Noble, RSC's artistic director for the last 12 years, announced his
resignation, thus sending the company into turmoil.</LD>
<LD>   Noble's announcement comes at a time when Britain's noncommercial
theater sector is in a volatile state, with artistic directors coming
and going with dizzying speed. At the National Theatre, Trevor Nunn
will be succeeded by Nicolas Hytner next March. At the Donmar, Sam
Mendes will give way to Michael Grandage in November. And Michael
Attenborough is succeeding Nicholas Kent and Ian McDiarmid at the
Almeida.</LD>
<TE>   In recent months, Noble, 51, had suffered considerable criticism
over his plans for a radical shakeup of the RSC, the biggest
reorganization since its founding in 1961. These included demolishing
the gigantic 70-year-old Royal Shakespeare Theatre in
Stratford-upon-Avon, the Bard's birthplace, and replacing it with a
more intimate, audience-friendly space at the center of what he
described as "a theater village." Architectural conservationists were
appalled.</TE>
<TE>   Noble also took steps to shorten RSC actors' contracts and reduce
the size of the company. Backstage staff threatened strikes over job
losses. In addition, Noble decided to abandon the Barbican, the
London theater built for the RSC in 1982, in favor of a wider, more
adventurous choice of venues.</TE>
<TE>   Announcing that he would leave next March to become a freelance
director, Noble said he knew his decision was "the right thing for me
and the right thing for the RSC," which he first joined in 1980.
"There have been absolutely extraordinary problems over the last 18
months while I have been pursuing this revolution in the company's
history, and now I think I have laid the foundations for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Others disagree. Sources within the RSC said Noble's supporters
who had defended him internally were particularly infuriated that he
had quit before his far-reaching reforms were completed.</TE>
<TE>   The other aspect of Noble's departure to cause outrage is his
timing. He had just returned to the RSC after a three-month
sabbatical, during which he directed the new West End musical "Chitty
Chitty Bang Bang," a $9-million production, based on the 1968 film of
the same title, that opened two weeks ago to good reviews. The
musical about a wacky inventor and his flying car is a huge hit and
has taken in $11.5 million in advance ticket sales. Now Noble, who
has a share of its profits, stands to become wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Spencer, the Daily Telegraph's outspoken theater critic,
has led a media campaign against Noble. "He deserves contempt for his
decision to bale out," Spencer has written. "What I feel for him now
is close to disgust. If ever a captain appeared to be deserting what
many perceive as a sinking ship ... then it is Noble. If he was
determined to go, why didn't he do so before rather than after the
opening of 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'?</TE>
<TE>   "The question will always remain: If 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' had
flopped, would Noble so heedlessly have abandoned his company, waving
a cheery 'who-needs-it' goodbye to his RSC salary? He stands revealed
as a hollow man who lacks the courage of his own convictions."</TE>
<TE>   Other media voices have criticized Noble's decision to quit. The
Observer's critic Susannah Clapp wrote: "In terms of timing, it's a
deed that beggars all description."</TE>
<TE>   A handful of Britain's leading stage actors had previously entered
the fray. Judi Dench and Michael Gambon had lent their support to a
campaign to save the Royal Shakespeare Company from demolition.
Another veteran actor, Donald Sinden, complained: "Don't change the
theater, change the company."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the British theater newspaper Stage two weeks ago,
Dench wrote that she was "deeply worried" about Noble's reforms. Last
year, Noble spoke out publicly about the "shocking forces of
conservatism" within and outside the RSC that opposed his plans for
reform.</TE>
<TE>   These arguments have become public partly because about one-third
of RSC's annual income (about $18.5 million) comes from public
subsidies. Yet many of the issues currently causing controversy at
the RSC apply to Britain's other leading noncommercial theater
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Noble is hardly the first big name from the subsidized sector to
make a fortune from work in the commercial West End. Nunn became rich
by directing "Cats" and "Starlight Express" for Andrew Lloyd Webber
in the 1980s (while he was artistic director of the RSC). Hytner,
too, became a millionaire as director of the original production of
"Miss Saigon."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Noble's departure from the RSC is a far more serious matter.
The company is in disarray creatively, having received critical
brickbats for a number of recent productions, notably "A Midsummer
Night's Dream." A well-received RSC production, "The Winter's Tale,"
is currently playing to scant audiences at another London venue, the
Roundhouse.</TE>
<TE>   And morale within the company is low. An RSC spokesman said at the
weekend: "It has been a testing time for staff over the past year."
And now the company's future direction again has been thrown into
disarray. Lord Alexander of Weedon, the RSC's chairman, is now
hinting at the possibility of a complete rethink of Noble's proposed
reforms--which may mean the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford
could be saved from the wrecking ball. "Morale at the RSC has not
been helped by Adrian's absence," said Alexander, who described the
timing of his departure as "unfortunate."</TE>

<HD>President of Music Center Resigns Post</HD>
<DH>The Arts * Joanne Kozberg, 57, who has held the spot since
'99, says expanding duties, UC job prompted her decision.</DH>

<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing "personal and professional reasons," Joanne Kozberg, president
of the Music Center of Los Angeles County, has resigned from the post
and will step down as soon as a successor can be found.</LD>
<LD>   Andrea Van de Kamp, chairman and chief executive of the Music
Center, said Monday that she expects the search for Kozberg's
replacement to take from six to eight months.</LD>
<LD>   Kozberg, who was named president of the downtown performing arts
complex in 1999, said Monday that she will leave the post in order to
concentrate more of her time and efforts on her role as a member of
the University of California Board of Regents, where she has served
three years of her 12-year appointment.</LD>
<TE>   And, although she has handled both jobs concurrently for several
years, Kozberg said the opening of the Music Center's newest venue,
Walt Disney Concert Hall, in 2003 will expand the duties of the Music
Center president to include overseeing new programming both at Disney
Hall, new home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and at Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion, which will have more time available on its stages
once the Philharmonic moves out.</TE>
<TE>   "Public policy has always been a primary love of mine," she said.
"I've always seen the Music Center as an incredible community
resource, and now it's got to go 24/7."</TE>
<TE>   During her years at the Music Center, Kozberg steered the merging
of Music Center Inc., the fund-raising arm for the center's resident
performing arts companies (the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Master
Chorale and Center Theatre Group), with the Music Center Operating
Co., which managed its theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Both Van de Kamp and Kozberg said that now that this project has
been completed, the center is seeking a new president who can take
more of an impresario role in future programming at both Disney Hall
and the Chandler Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here to merge the Music Center Operating Co. with the
Music Center, Inc., and it's been an effective merger," Kozberg said.
"I really think that now is the time we begin to recruit somebody who
has theatrical operations background, and will be in place before,
during and after the opening of Disney Hall."</TE>
<TE>   While the Music Center has been a co-presenter of a number of
productions and musical engagements at its county-owned complex, Van
de Kamp said that, following the merger of the two entities, the
county Board of Supervisors authorized the Music Center to begin to
present programming as a separate entity, rather than in partnership
with a third-party presenter.</TE>
<TE>   Both Kozberg and Van de Kamp said the Music Center has plans to
expand dance programming, as well as to make the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion and Disney Hall available for more community programming
using local artists and performing groups. "There are many community
groups that want to perform at the Music Center, but can't because
we've been so full," Kozberg said. "We see ourselves as becoming a
huge community resource for a different type of programming."</TE>
<TE>   Kozberg, 57, took over as Music Center president in February 1999,
following three years of interim leadership at the center. She served
from 1991 to 1993 as executive director and chairwoman of the
California Arts Council and in former Gov. Pete Wilson's cabinet from
1993 to 1998 as secretary of the State and Consumer Services Agency.
Before that she was senior policy advisor to Wilson when he was in
the U.S. Senate. The Canadian native grew up in Beverly Hills and
graduated from UC Berkeley.</TE>

<HD>A Symphonic Fusion of Israeli Sounds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The traditional elements of world music and the instrumentation of a
symphony orchestra don't make a particularly compatible combination.
The instruments found around the globe are as varied as their
countries of origin, while the orchestra, with its well established
phalanxes of strings, woodwinds, brass and percussion, evolved as the
expression of a much more specific cultural area.</LD>
<LD>   All of which raised the question of what to expect from the Los
Angeles Jewish Symphony's performance at the Sinai Temple on Sunday
in a program described as the "Jewish fusion" of Israel's music. The
answers were as varied as the works, all of which were written by
composers born in Israel.</LD>
<LD>   "Kadim (East Wind)" by Moshe Rasiuk, "Symphony #1" by Benjamin
Yusupov and "Exodus" by Ariel Davydov, although dramatically
different in content, made similar efforts to extract Middle Eastern
timbres from the orchestra. Rasiuk emphasized swirling string sounds
and busy woodwinds to create his impressionistic landscape. Yusupov,
in his much larger work, attempted to simulate the sounds of ethnic
instruments.</LD>
<TE>   The program's most fascinating moments, however, took place when
dancer Or Nili Azulay was on stage, in "Israel Suite" by Noam Sheriff
and "Sephardic Songs of Exile" by Yuval Ron. Her richly textured
Spanish style superbly amplified the Sephardic elements of the music.
And when she was joined by singer Maya Haddi, drummer Jamie Papish
and composer Ron on oud in the latter work, the program fulfilled its
promise to seek out and illustrate the cultural fusion of Israel's
music.</TE>

<DH>Oasis, the Strokes and Prodigy had a lot to prove, but Mars
Volta steals the night.</DH>

<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIO</DL>
<LD>"Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star," Oasis' Liam Gallagher sang in
the closing minutes of the third Coachella Valley Music and Arts
Festival here Sunday, and you couldn't help but marvel at the
difference between this and the first time you heard him sing the
line.</LD>
<LD>   In the English group's debut album eight years ago, Gallagher, 21
at the time, injected "Rock 'n' Roll Star" with the celebration and
defiance of a young man vowing to triumph over everyone and
everything that had made him feel inferior.</LD>
<LD>   It's a frequent rock 'n' roll theme, but Oasis expressed it with
uncommon power in that album, "Definitely Maybe," thanks to the
conviction in Gallagher's voice, some of the most glorious melodic
hooks since Lennon-McCartney and a guitar-driven propulsion that
echoed the optimism of the album's biggest hit, "Live Forever."</LD>
<TE>   On Sunday, however, there was little of that captivating
self-assurance. Rather than a battle cry, Gallagher's vocal seemed
simply workmanlike, perhaps betraying the sense of struggle
surrounding the band, which badly needs to rebuild critical and
commercial credibility after years of off-putting behavior and a
severely disappointing 2000 album, "Standing on the Shoulders of
Giants."</TE>
<TE>   Amid the warm, relaxed vibe at the 80-acre Empire Polo Field on a
gorgeous spring day, Oasis' performance was a reminder that several
of the main-stage bands had a lot at stake. Perception is nearly
everything in the pop world, and Oasis and two other groups were
taking the stage Sunday at crucial points in their careers.</TE>
<TE>   The Prodigy, the British techno-rock wonder of the mid-'90s, was
battling to prove that it still deserves a place in the rock
hierarchy after almost five years of silence. And newcomers the
Strokes needed to assert that they warrant all the talk about their
being key members of rock's budding renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Coachella festival itself was on trial. After two
promising but inconclusive stagings and one year off, the ambitious
affair needed to prove that it deserves to be an annual fixture on
the Southern California concert scene.</TE>
<TE>   Of the four question marks, only the festival deserved an
unqualified rave. The event, which drew an estimated 55,000 fans to
see some 60 acts over two days, was marred Saturday by massive
traffic delays in this desert city 125 miles east of L.A., but
otherwise it was a superbly satisfying experience.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing the spirit of European rock festivals, Coachella sidesteps
mundane hit-makers in favor of a cutting-edge lineup that reflects
many of the strongest currents in today's rock and electronic fields.</TE>
<TE>   The favorable buzz even lured some European festival organizers
Sunday to see if they could pick up ideas. There were also lots of
hotshot agents and managers checking out talent.</TE>
<TE>   Given the taste-maker nature of the fans drawn to the classy
lineup, the buzz--pro or con--from a performance here can be
enormous. One beneficiary this year is likely to be Mars Volta, an
explosive rock band led by some former members of At the Drive-In.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three main-stage headliners, the Strokes got the first
chance to generate some favorable word of mouth. The group, which
took the stage around 5 p.m. in the sunshine, is one reason there is
so much talk about a return of passion and imagination in a rock
scene dominated for years by one-dimensional and flyweight acts.</TE>
<TE>   One problem with the Strokes on their debut album, "Is This It,"
is that it takes the return to rock passion and excitement too
literally. The music and look draw heavily from a series of earlier
New York rock sources, none more obvious than Lou Reed and the Velvet
Underground.</TE>
<TE>   Though some of the songs on the album capture the darkly
seductive, world-weary spirit of those works, the Strokes' set might
have been more striking to young fans if the band had cut out the
middleman and just started playing such Reed/Velvet songs as "Walk on
the Wild Side" and "Waiting for the Man."</TE>
<TE>   With growth as songwriters and a touch more charisma for lead
singer Julian Casablanca, the Strokes could contribute to the looming
rock upswing. To think of them as leaders of the pack, however, seems
a stretch.</TE>
<TE>   After a fast-paced set by the Foo Fighters that was brightened by
a guest stint from singer-actor Jack Black, the Prodigy took the main
stage around 8:15 p.m. to begin its campaign to recapture the
momentum it had in 1997, thanks to its inspired blend of techno power
and rock-show imagery.</TE>
<TE>   The key to that original breakthrough was "Firestarter," a display
of techno-rock energy so marvelous that leader Liam Howlett has spent
years trying to figure out a suitable follow-up. He may finally have
one in "Nuclear," another explosive piece that highlighted the
Prodigy's hourlong set.</TE>
<TE>   But one track may not be enough, especially at a time when new
energy is in the air. The remaining new material felt lumbering or
overly familiar, and the old stuff sounded dated.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Flint, one of the band's two vocalists, played the Johnny
Rotten rock-rebel role well in the "Firestarter" days but seemed as
unconvincing Sunday as Rotten himself was on the Sex Pistols' reunion
tour. And, yes, the band did play a tough, defiant version of its
controversial "Smack My Bitch Up," suggesting that it could care less
about concerns over the song's title. (The group maintains that the
phrase means to achieve maximum energy and doesn't refer specifically
to women.)</TE>
<TE>   Oasis took the stage just before 10 p.m. and never quite caught
fire, chiefly because there was simply no winning new material. "The
Hindu Times," the band's new single, summarized a lot of what was
once appealing about this band, but it seemed recycled, and "Force of
Nature" showed little of Oasis' most endearing touches.</TE>
<TE>   The new album is due in July and it may have some wonders on it,
but they weren't evident Sunday. As they moved in workmanlike fashion
toward the end of the set with "Rock 'n' Roll Star," the song seemed
like a melancholy reflection rather than a battle cry.</TE>
<TE>   Of the other rock acts sampled in Coachella's other three tents
and stages, the standout was Mars Volta. Led by former At the
Drive-In singer Cedric Bixler and guitarist Omar Rodriguez, the group
put on a galvanizing set that lived up to the spirit of their former
band's physical and sonic attack. Mars Volta plays with a
windshield-shattering force and puts its faith in the visceral power
of music to be liberating.</TE>
<TE>   On a night on which you came away from Coachella worrying about
the future of some old favorites, the weekend provided an
electrifying new favorite.</TE>

<LD>   Carson Breaks Silence in Magazine Interview</LD>
<LD>   Since his final "Tonight Show" goodbye on May 22, 1992, Johnny
Carson has avoided the spotlight. But the former late-night star
comments on his post-TV life and the state of the medium in a 10-page
feature in the June issue of Esquire, out next week.</LD>
<TE>   Carson, 76, says he turned down an invitation to appear on NBC's
75th anniversary special next month. "I know NBC means well. But I am
retired. I ain't going back on television," he maintains in the
article, according to an account on Drudgereport.com.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gonna be one of those self-congratulatory things. 'Look how
good we are!' I'm just not going to do it," Carson adds.</TE>
<TE>   And reality shows such as "Survivor" or "Fear Factor," it's clear,
are also not his thing.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are in just about as much jeopardy as I am having
dinner. People forget that there's a crew there. There's a catering
service," Carson says. "It's not like they are going to die out there
in the jungle." Meanwhile, Jay Leno, who celebrates his 10th
anniversary as Carson's successor with an hourlong special at 10
tonight, tells Newsday that friction with Carson arising from a
clumsy transition has been relegated to the past. They talk
occasionally, he says, although not about the show.</TE>
<TE>   "He had all the elements that are necessary for the job," Leno
said of Carson. "Just the fact that Johnny could play the drums, do a
little soft shoe, do magic.... Is there anybody in late night now
you'd want to see with their shirt off? No, Johnny was the best there
ever was and is."</TE>
<TE>   Challenge to Credentials of Ex-Fox Consultant</TE>
<TE>   A Fox News Channel consultant, employed for four months during the
war on terrorism, wasn't what he appeared to be, the New York Times
reports.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Cafasso allegedly claimed to be a retired lieutenant
colonel in the Special Forces, saying he had served in Vietnam, won a
Silver Star for bravery and was part of an unsuccessful secret
mission to rescue hostages in Iran in 1980. Yet military records
showed he was discharged as a private after spending 44 days at boot
camp in Fort Dix, N.J., in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Fox News declined to comment on the story Monday but confirmed the
accuracy of the N.Y. Times' account.</TE>
<TE>   Fox officials told the Times they were unaware of any false
information that was aired as a result of Cafasso's military analysis
and said its reporters were required to independently verify anything
he told them.</TE>
<TE>   The network ended its relationship with Cafasso in March after he
began alienating staff members.</TE>
<TE>   The Times said Cafasso sent the newspaper an e-mail message
saying, "This is nothing more than political assassination by a group
of self-centered individuals with their own political agendas, who
enjoy half-truths, gossip and hiding behind the press for their own
self-worth."</TE>
<TE>   Rather Close to Re-Upping with CBS</TE>
<TE>   Dan Rather, 70, is hammering out an agreement that would extend
his contract with CBS News for an additional three years, taking him
through the year 2006, according to people familiar with the
situation.</TE>
<TE>   The move comes at a time when contracts for both ABC's Peter
Jennings and NBC's Tom Brokaw are expiring.</TE>
<TE>   CBS News declined to comment Monday on Rather's contract
extension, which is not yet final, saying, "We consider all
contractual information to be confidential, but as long as Dan wants
to work in television, we want him to work at CBS."</TE>
<TE>   Cast Members Reunite for 'Ally' Finale</TE>
<TE>   David Duchovny is returning for the final episode of "The X-Files"
and now "Ally McBeal" is following suit, announcing Monday that the
show will bring back three departed members of the original cast for
the finale on May 20--including one whose character died.</TE>
<TE>   The appearance of Gil Bellows as Ally's former paramour and
colleague, Billy, won't surprise fans of the Fox series, however.
He's made several appearances as a ghost since Billy died in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Also returning for the final episode will be Courtney
Thorne-Smith, who played Billy's wife, Georgia, and Lisa Nicole
Carson, who played Ally's roommate, Renee.</TE>
<TE>   Singer Barry White also will appear in the May 20 installment, Fox
said--which longtime "Ally" fans will find as fitting as the
episode's title: "Bygones."</TE>

<TE>   'Hey Jude' Manuscript Off Christie's Roster</TE>
<TE>   Paul McCartney won a court order Monday blocking the sale of a
draft manuscript of the Beatles hit "Hey Jude" the day before the
document, valued at $116,000, was due to go to auction at Christie's.</TE>
<TE>   The injunction was granted at London's High Court after McCartney
said the 19-line manuscript in his handwriting had disappeared from
his home. The lyrics were sent for auction by a man identified in
court only as Monsieur Tessier, who bought them in the famous
Portobello Road street market in London in 1971 or 1972.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   The Web site Eonline reports that "Will &amp; Grace" co-star Sean
Hayes will play Jerry Lewis in the CBS movie "Martin &amp;
Lewis"....Patrick Stewart ("Star Trek: The Next Generation") and
Glenn Close ("Fatal Attraction") will portray King Henry II of
England and his scheming wife, Queen Eleanor of Acquitaine in "The
Lion in Winter" for Showtime....Fox has ordered another season of its
drama "Boston Public." And HBO has renewed "Six Feet Under" for a
third season, with 13 episodes to debut next year.</TE>

<HD>Deconstructing a Tragedy</HD>
<DH>'Why the Towers Fell' takes a disturbing look at the
collapse of the World Trade Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's something morbidly fascinating about tonight's episode of
"Nova," called "Why the Towers Fell."</LD>
<LD>   By now, the images of the two Boeing 767s gliding silently into
the sides of the World Trade Center's twin towers, and the subsequent
explosions of fire, have left most of us numb. In the "Nova"
documentary, the Sept. 11 images are repeated over and over again,
from a variety of angles, and one's first impulse is to turn away.</LD>
<LD>   But the images are not gratuitous. They become important evidence
in answering the PBS show's central question: Could changes in the
towers' design have prevented their collapse? And the conclusions are
unsettling. Although the twin towers were basically structurally
sound, certain refinements in the design probably would have saved
more lives.</LD>
<TE>   The show is based on an investigation by a team from the American
Society of Civil Engineers for the Federal Emergency Management
Agency. (The last eight minutes of the show, focusing on the team's
final conclusions and its recommendations for future building safety,
were not available for review. The study will be released in full on
Wednesday.)</TE>
<TE>   The investigation begins with an analysis of the twin towers'
structure, which was considered innovative for its time.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike older skyscrapers, which are often supported on a dense
grid of steel columns and beams, the trade center towers were mainly
supported by a dense latticework of steel columns set along the
buildings' outer walls. A second system of columns was clustered at
each building's core, which housed the elevators and staircases. The
idea was to create a completely open floor plan, unobstructed by the
usual network of interior columns.</TE>
<TE>   That meant that if either system failed, the tower would fall. And
the show makes the case that the two towers failed for very different
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Most of us know, for example, that when the first plane smashed
into the north tower's north facade, it left a gaping hole in the
building's exterior. But according to investigators, the more
critical damage occurred inside, where the impact destroyed many of
the core's supporting columns. It also did severe damage to the
drywall that was meant to protect the columns from fire. The
subsequent blaze softened the remaining steel, and eventually the
core began to collapse, bringing the rest of the building down with
it.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the south tower, the core survived largely intact.
But the extreme force of the impact shook loose the sprayed-on
fireproofing that was intended to protect the steel floor trusses
that held the exterior columns in place. Once the fire weakened the
trusses, the exterior columns began to buckle outward, causing the
tower to fall.</TE>
<TE>   The show uses a range of video footage to hammer home this point.
A slow-motion image of the north tower's collapse shows the central
antenna beginning to fall just before the building's exterior
envelope, confirming that the core gave way first. The south tower,
by comparison, tilts slightly before crumbling to the ground, as if
the reverse had happened.</TE>
<TE>   The implication is clear: If the steel fireproofing had been more
adequate, one, if not both, of the towers might have survived, at
least for a little bit longer.</TE>
<TE>   The show makes other, more subtle points that are equally
unsettling. In each tower, all of the staircases were contained in
the center. When the first plane destroyed the north tower's core, it
cut off the main escape route for those on the floors above. Had the
core been constructed of concrete and steel instead of steel and
drywall, one or more of the staircases might have survived, meaning
that more people could have escaped.</TE>
<TE>   But what finally makes the documentary so disturbing is its
unspoken subtext. Terrorism is now a fact of life in America.
Engineers, like the rest of us, will have to take into account a
potential level of violence that, not so long ago, seemed totally
unimaginable. And that, ultimately, is the show's most painful
message of all.</TE>

<HD>A Mournful Program From Pacific Chorale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Alexander's Pacific Chorale has a core of about 26 professional
singers. At full strength, some 150 voices, however, it loses its
professional edge. The singing lacks incisive attack, tension in line
and variety in dynamic and color.</LD>
<LD>   Add to that a mostly a cappella program weighted toward sleep,
death and mourning Sunday at the Orange County Performing Arts
Center, and the overall results were rather lugubrious.</LD>
<LD>   Half the program was devoted to works by Eric Whitacre, now in his
second year as the Chorale's composer-in-residence. His music is
better than it sounded.</LD>
<TE>   Take "When David Heard," a setting of a single sentence from II
Samuel, that Alexander stretched almost to 19 minutes. The work
builds quickly from hushed intonation to a gloriously anguished chord
on the word "Absalom." Then it breaks into sequences of silence and
wailing, which began to sound aimless and mannered, as if Alexander
and the singers were losing focus and direction.</TE>
<TE>   Though begun before the tragic event, Anglican church composer
Herbert Howells' Requiem was a response to the death of his
9-year-old son in 1935. The work remained so personal to him he kept
it private until 1980, when he was 88. Alexander led a gentle and
reflective performance that failed to reveal the deep meanings it
must have had for the composer.</TE>
<TE>   Emphasizing nostalgia, the Chorale also sang five of Copland's
"Old American Songs" accompanied by pianist Lori Loftus.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Chorale Children's Chorus, led by Mary Ester Blakley
and accompanied by Jill Carter, sang two pieces sweetly--Rene
Clausen's Psalm 100 and Donald Patriquin's play song, "J'entends le
Moulin." Led by Alexander, the kids also sang Copland's "Simple
Gifts" and "I Bought Me a Cat."</TE>

<HD>Baroque Opera, With an Ear for the Modern</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a voice of angelic purity, halo of frizzy hair and girlish sweet
smile, Emma Kirkby has been a kind of fairy princess of the early
music movement since she first dropped in on it in the early '80s.
Her tone unblemished by vibrato, her crystal-clear articulation of
words and her exquisite ornamentations of vocal lines have made her a
model singer. The English soprano not only revealed how Renaissance
and Baroque music theoretically should sound but also how it best
communicates to a modern audience. Listening to her, you might
experience the miracle of time travel and the recognition of
something modern.</LD>
<LD>   Attitudes, however, evolve, including our attitudes toward old
music. Though there can be no doubt that Kirkby, who has made more
than 100 recordings, has influenced a generation of singers, many
young disciples have found a new way to restore some of the weight
and emotional richness she removed from the Baroque style while still
maintaining the flexibility. And that updated early music practice,
allied with contemporary dramatic principles, has fueled the revival
of Handel opera.</LD>
<TE>   Thus, Kirkby, who appeared Sunday at the First Baptist Church of
Los Angeles to sing arias from Handel's "Julius Caesar" and
"Rinaldo," seemed at first something of a throwback, just the way she
had once made other singers seem. Reading from scores, she made
little effort at theatricality. And it took her longer than it once
had to warm up.</TE>
<TE>   But this singer is not to be underestimated. Her voice has not
become heavier or less stable with age (although it is slightly
thinner). Her tone is as pure, her agility as effortless-sounding, as
ever.</TE>
<TE>   And once a listener adapted to what now seems an unusually light
and demure approach to some of Handel's best-known arias, she also
proved as persuasive as ever.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was she the only pleasure of this concert, which was part of
the Chamber Music in Historic Sites series put on by Mount St. Mary's
College and which included the first Los Angeles appearance of the
Freiburg Baroque Orchestra. This ensemble has become familiar from
its participation in opera recordings over the past decade under the
direction of guest conductors. But it has more recently been making a
name for itself playing as it did Sunday, under its first violin,
Gottfried von der Goltz.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 18 players for this concert seemed too young and eager
to have been with the orchestra from its founding. One of the things
that distinguishes young period practice players from their mentors
in the movement is the removal of reverence. The Freiburg violins and
violas play standing up. And Von der Goltz, who is also the artistic
director, does not conduct so much as egg on, turning to fellow
players and jamming with them. They all seem to be having the time of
their lives.</TE>
<TE>   The instrumental portion of the all-Handel program included two
concerto grossi (Opus 3, No. 4 and Opus 6, No. 6) along with the
rarely heard incidental music to Ben Johnson's "The Alchymist." The
playing in all cases was bright and enthusiastic, rhythmically
aggressive and complex in its ornamentation and expressive use of
swell. Although the strings are relieved only by two oboes, a
bassoon, theorbo and harpsichord (here all but inaudible), the
Freiburgers have a vivid sense of instrumental color and rich
textures.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanying Kirkby, the orchestra changed character and became
more subdued, vigilantly following her lighter lead. Kirkby's
singing, the tone so white and open, may be on the virginal side for
Cleopatra. But she brought an impressive amount of passion,
nonetheless, to "Se pieta?" in which the Egyptian queen vacillates
between despair and rage.</TE>
<TE>   And Kirkby still has the ability to surprise. One of Handel's most
famous arias, "Lascia ch'io pianga," a heartbreakingly beautiful
lament from "Rinaldo," is commonly sung slow and laden with mournful
emotion. Kirkby, however, explained that she feels the character,
Almira, who is preparing to die, may hope that a hint of
coquettishness could save her.</TE>
<TE>   Lightly decorated, tripping off her tongue, the aria took on new
character, less funereal and all the lovelier for being slightly
seductive. Perhaps Kirkby still has a thing or two to reveal to us
about Baroque opera--and herself--after all.</TE>

<HD>'Cheers,' 'Elsewhere' Players Reunite</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the '80s, everybody knew their names: the casts of "Cheers" and
"St. Elsewhere," one of that decade's best comedies and one of its
best dramas.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, NBC is getting those acting bands back together, if only
for one episode each of the venerable "Frasier" and the up-and-coming
"Scrubs." Like, gnarly.</LD>
<LD>   On "Frasier" (9 p.m.), the good radio doctor (Kelsey Grammer) and
family fly to Boston for a business conference, only to run into
Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) as they deplane. It's a little-known
fact that Cliff, the postman who always brings twice as much
misinformation as mail, is retiring and moving to Florida, and
there's a party that night. The festivities give ample opportunity
for Carla (Rhea Perlman), Cliff, Norm (George Wendt), Paul (Paul
Willson) and Phil (Philip Perlman) to deliver one-liners in the
classic tradition of "Cheers," the series that begat "Frasier"
(Cliff: "Hey, so what's going down, Norm?" Norm: "My blood-alcohol
level. Suds, do your work").</LD>
<TE>   Interestingly enough, the going-away party takes place in a hotel,
not the bar, which Sam has booked for a Red Sox event. (This
apparently explains Sam's absence too. Though you never know:
Perhaps, a la Ted Danson on CBS tonight, he was off communicating
with the spirit of Coach.)</TE>
<TE>   Whereas this is a reunion episode in the typical sense, "Scrubs"
(9:30 p.m.) takes a more sly approach to nostalgia. In fact, most of
the episode revolves around the usual hilarious misadventures of the
show's three medical interns: J.D. (Zach Braff), Turk (Donald Faison)
and Elliot (Sarah Chalke).</TE>
<TE>   Yet the cameo appearance of "St. Elsewhere" regulars William
Daniels, Ed Begley Jr., Stephen Furst and Eric Laneuville as doctors
taken ill at a convention, comes across as a subtle homage to the
history of hospital TV series. The quartet isn't playing the same
characters from the old show (in fact, Laneuville portrayed an
orderly back then). But as the four spout medical terminology and
humorously interact with the young doctors, they prove to be masters
of allusion.</TE>

<HD>Last Chance for Amtrak</HD>

<LD>Amtrak, right now, is the little engine that couldn't. Last year it
lost $1.1 billion. This year it has laid off hundreds of mechanics
and station agents, with the result that a worried Federal Railroad
Administration put it on a special safety watch.</LD>
<LD>   The arrival last week of David L. Gunn--known for turning around
troubled transportation systems in New York, Philadelphia and other
cities--as the new president of Amtrak offers a last chance to
salvage passenger rail in America.</LD>
<LD>   Sept. 11 showed that Amtrak serves an important purpose.
Nationwide, it runs 265 trains each weekday, and its daily passenger
traffic between New York and Washington replaces more than 100
airplane flights. But Amtrak's woes include insufficient capital, low
employee morale, crumbling equipment and $3 billion in debt. The
recession and increased security costs added to revenue shortfalls
this year. The Bush administration has budgeted $521 million for
Amtrak in 2003, but Amtrak says it needs $2.5 billion, an imposing
gap.</LD>
<TE>   The source of the problem is Congress' decree in 1997 that Amtrak
become self-supporting by the end of 2002. The demand reeks of a
double standard. Amtrak's $30 billion in federal subsidies over 30
years is not small change, but it pales in comparison with $1.89
trillion in air travel and highway subsidies. Previous Amtrak
President George D. Warrington foolishly tried to reach
self-sufficiency by cutting maintenance of equipment and roadbeds. In
February, he announced that Amtrak this year would slash $285 million
in expenses and capital improvements. Such cutbacks have gutted
Amtrak's ability to provide even minimally reliable service.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has not only underfunded Amtrak but also demanded that it
retain its most unprofitable long-distance lines. The only profitable
routes are in the Northeast corridor; almost all others lose money.
Routes in California and the Pacific Northwest receive state
subsidies that help make up the gap. The rest, such as the Empire
Builder from Chicago to Seattle, lose about $100 a ticket.</TE>
<TE>   In February, a hostile federal commission, the Amtrak Reform
Council, called for privatizing routes, which ultimately would kill
passenger rail. Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) countered with
proposed legislation that would give Amtrak $4.6 billion over the
next five years to renovate track and create high-speed corridors.
Hollings' subsidy would be for naught, however, if Amtrak did not put
its fiscal house in order. That includes a critical look at top-heavy
management.</TE>
<TE>   The no-nonsense Gunn rejects privatization or slashing routes to
the point that Amtrak is no longer a public service. He says he
intends to make executives show that they are actually working. He
also should develop a detailed business plan that breaks down
expenses, revenue and ridership. Amtrak removes traffic from
congested roads and air corridors and deserves some subsidy. Not,
however, a free ride.</TE>

<LD>Two weeks ago, the Los Angeles City Council slapped a fee of almost
$500 on each billboard in town to pay for the first citywide
inventory of the thousands of outdoor signs that contribute to the
visual clutter around town. The council's vote was just a baby step
toward stopping the mushrooming illegal signs, but, given billboard
lobbyists' fat wallets and cozy connections to several council
members, the outcome was heartening.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the council again takes up the hot issue of billboards. If
lawmakers hold their resolve, L.A. residents finally may begin to see
a reduction in the bombardment of signs and ads that confront us on
our streets.</LD>
<LD>   Two proposals before the council are worthy of support. One would
make permanent the city's temporary ban on new billboards. A second
proposal would get the ball rolling to create so-called special-use
districts. In some communities--Hollywood might be one--neighbors see
billboards as part of the local charm. Designation as a special-use
district would allow new signs, but only in communities that
demonstrated they wanted them.</LD>
<TE>   Close to rejection, we hope, is the plan the outdoor advertisers
wanted so badly last year that would have allowed them to erect 70
gigantic signs along local freeways--on land previously off limits to
billboards--in exchange for demolishing an undetermined number of
signs looming over city streets. Council members, including some who
embraced this swap deal last year, now see it for what it is: a
giveaway to the billboard companies with little payback for residents
fed up with screaming advertisements visible in every direction.</TE>
<TE>   The next big challenge will be to find ways to cut the number of
billboards. The fee-funded inventory will identify illegal signs.
Legal action should be the next step. When the skies overhead clear,
Los Angeles residents once again can be proud of how our city looks.</TE>

<HD>An Artful Deal in Ramallah</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's sharpened focus on the Middle East has
produced its first breakthrough, an artful compromise that frees
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in exchange for letting U.S. and
British monitors keep guard over six men wanted by Israel and holed
up with Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   The release of Arafat will reduce pressure on Egypt, Jordan and
Saudi Arabia from their pro-Palestinian residents, and it is up to
them to encourage and pressure Arafat and his allies to end their
terror attacks. The White House must also keep up pressure on Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to continue withdrawing troops and
resolve a church standoff in Bethlehem.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement regarding Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah calls
for British and American guards to ensure the confinement of five
Palestinians accused of assassinating Israel's tourism minister last
October and a sixth who is accused in the attempted smuggling of a
shipload of arms into Palestinian territory. The men will be taken
from Arafat's compound and jailed in a Palestinian lockup. Arafat, in
return, gets to leave the battered compound where he has been penned
by Israeli troops since December.</LD>
<TE>   Israel yielded to U.S. pressure after weeks of ignoring President
Bush's demands that it immediately withdraw troops from reoccupied
Palestinian territories. Arab nations interpreted the defiance as
either U.S. unwillingness or inability to influence Sharon, even
after Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's trip to the region. The
crown prince of Saudi Arabia, a major supplier of oil to the United
States, visited Bush's Texas ranch last week and warned that
Washington had to do more to rein in Israel or risk destabilizing the
region.</TE>
<TE>   The Ramallah deal is only a start. Another siege continues at the
historic Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, where Israel says
Palestinian men wanted for various offenses have taken refuge, along
with civilians and Eastern Orthodox church staff members. Israel has
offered the wanted men a choice of trial by Israel or exile, but
Palestinian negotiators insist that the men be allowed to stay in
Palestinian territory. Eastern Orthodox Christians will celebrate
their Easter this Sunday, and it is symbolically important for
negotiators to resolve the impasse before then.</TE>
<TE>   Israel also should allow U.N. fact-finders to investigate the
killings in the Palestinian refugee camp in Jenin. Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres said more than a week ago that Israel would accept the
investigators, but Israel keeps adding conditions and objecting to
the makeup of the team. Israel has long distrusted the United
Nations, with good reason. Radical nations engineered the U.N.
declaration that Zionism is a form of racism a quarter-century ago
and raised the topic at a U.N. conference last year. Israel also has
valid questions about how the Jenin camp became a refuge for
Palestinian terrorists even though it is administered by the U.N. But
the addition of military experts to the investigating team should
satisfy many objections. It will benefit Israel to let the
investigators try to determine what happened in Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   Outsiders need to pull Israelis and Palestinians apart and keep
applying pressure to end the violence. The U.S., helped by Britain
and Saudi Arabia, has made a good start. All parties need to press
forward without hesitation.</TE>

<HD>Lerner: Self-Hatred Charges Stifle Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The suggestion by Michael Lerner ("Israel's Jewish Critics Aren't
'Self-Hating,'" Opinion, April 28) that he has been labeled a
self-hating Jew is a red herring intended to divert attention from
his distortion of the facts. Lerner states that Ehud Barak acted in
bad faith during the Camp David negotiations and then reverses
himself by writing that at Taba the parties were close to agreement.
He neglects to add that after those negotiations Yasser Arafat
started hostilities. He writes that Barak did not address the refugee
issue; there was an offer of compensation with the resettlement of an
agreed number of refugees.</LD>
<LD>   Israel was not responsible for the 1948 refugee problem, and the
sources Lerner referred to make that point. Barak also addressed the
settlements at Camp David and agreed to dismantle all but six, for
which there would be an exchange of land. This short explanation
should cast doubt on Lerner's claim that others have called him
names; it is his understanding of events that is the problem.</LD>
<LD>   Robert C. Gusman</LD>
<TE>   Calabasas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lerner is correct in confronting those within the Jewish community
who would stifle dissent on Israeli actions by labeling Jews who do
not agree with Ariel Sharon's tactics "self-hating." This McCarthyite
tactic has been shown for what it is: a way for pro-Sharon elements
to dismiss much-needed debate within the Jewish community.</TE>
<TE>   There are many Jews within the U.S. who do not agree with Israel's
illegal occupation. Lerner and all the other Jewish voices need to be
supported, as their voices are the missing ingredient in helping to
change the fascist policies of Zionist Israel and in helping to shape
the new Israel to become a democratic nation with justice, liberty
and guaranteed citizen rights for all.</TE>
<TE>   Shereen Sabet</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lerner's doubts about whether "Jewishness is worth preserving if
it means the Jewishness of Sharon" cause me to wonder. Does he
realize that his obvious disgust with Sharon must be projected onto
the millions of Israelis who now overwhelmingly support Sharon's
policies and who elected him by a great majority? We in Israel share
Lerner's yearning for a settlement that will bring "recognition of
Israel by surrounding Arab states and an end to all acts of terror
and violence." We realize that until that day comes, we must fight
for our right to live here in security.</TE>
<TE>   Joshua Harvey</TE>
<TE>   Jerusalem</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lerner is truly the Atticus Finch of American Jewry. While so many
American Jews wrongfully applaud the ongoing brutality of the Israeli
occupation of Palestine, Lerner speaks for the few of us who despise
the injustices and humiliations that Israel has been inflicting upon
the Palestinians for decades. We are not self-hating but proud of our
Jewish heritage of ethics and social justice, of which Lerner
represents the very best.</TE>

<LD>Re "From Jewish Outlook, Media Are Another Enemy," April 28: Critics
of The Times and other newspapers are not necessarily "pro-Israel"
and "anti-Palestinian"; they are informed individuals who expect
coverage that is equitable and in-depth, rather than the prevailing
reportage, which uses such Hollywood archetypes as villains and
underdogs to tell simplistic fairy tales about world events.
Heart-tugging human-interest angles have their place, but they cannot
substitute for historical perspective and intelligent analysis. As
publishers of a major newspaper, the charge of anti-Semitism ought be
the least of your worries; your first task is fulfilling your
responsibility to inform our free society. And in that regard, you
fail.</LD>

<TE>   Regarding the graffiti on a wall in Jerusalem (photo), "Foreign
Press--Israel's enemy": I have never experienced access to more
relevant information on the Mideast conflict in the daily newspaper
than in recent years, and I resent any efforts to turn back the clock
on this state of affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Israel treats the foreign press as an enemy, it does not
follow that Israel is an enemy of the foreign press. Do Israel's
supporters seriously contend that the American public has been kept
in the dark about the cafe bombings? Do Americans have a more
balanced view if they remain ignorant of 30 years of settling fully
enfranchised Israeli citizens in annexed territories where the
original inhabitants remain foreigners?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am outraged and incredibly discouraged at the current state budget
crisis that victimizes our schools yet continues to somehow find
money for other projects, namely the prison system. Two headlines
caught my attention on April 26. While "$459 Million in Cuts Are
Considered for Fiscally Strapped L.A. Schools," right below it,
readers are alerted that there is a "New Lease on Life for San
Quentin." How comforting! Public schools across California face cuts
left and right. I teach at a community college and I see the blows to
our budget firsthand.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, the cuts to education are necessary because "state
funding is not keeping pace . . . with [school] expenses." But
somehow, the state will find plenty of money--$199 million, according
to the San Quentin article--to "modernize" its death row facility.</LD>
<LD>   Your headlines confirm what we state educators face every day,
every fiscal year: cuts and more cuts to our schools, while death row
inmates will enjoy a "modernized" facility. I challenge readers to
write to Gov. Gray Davis and ask him to make good on his promise. Ask
him to do what he was elected to do: make education his priority, and
find the money to fund our schools, not our prisons.</LD>

<LD>Re "CIA Warns of Chinese Plans for Cyber-Attacks on U.S.," April 25:
Although China's cyber-warfare discourse has hitherto outpaced its
capability, it is perilous to underestimate Beijing's fancy for
"asymmetric war."</LD>
<LD>   Beijing seeks to capitalize on the advent of the information
revolution and rising nationalism in China and turn the Internet into
a curious "weapon of the weak" for achieving its political objectives
(e.g., subduing Taiwan and deterring American intervention). Last May
the "honkers" (from the Chinese wordplay "red hackers") launched
coordinated attacks that defaced thousands of U.S. Web sites,
paralyzed an untold number of computer systems, penetrated the public
information page of the White House and destroyed all data on Web
servers to which they were able to gain access. However, their
attacks also triggered furious retaliation by hackers in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Last year's episode shows that although presently an "electronic
Pearl Harbor" may seem far-fetched, the U.S. risks surprise if it
fails to seriously deal with China's clear strides in that direction.</LD>

<LD>Re "Born to Be Wild, at Full Decibel," Commentary, April 23: As a
former motorcycle rider I have to admit I enjoy the sound of a
Harley, even when the mufflers have been cut off. Of course I realize
it can be overdone, especially when several bikers are traveling
together. However, what really sets my teeth on edge are the people
who have giant speakers mounted in the trunks of their cars or in the
beds of their pickups--and play rap music with its filthy lyrics loud
enough to knock the fillings out of your teeth. That's real noise
pollution!</LD>

<LD>In "2nd Tourist Blasts Off for Space Station," your April 25 article
on the first South African man in space, I could not help but think
of the critical food shortages in his own and other southern African
countries. While Mark Shuttleworth earned the money and is certainly
entitled to use it as he sees fit, I cannot help but surmise that $20
million could have gone a long way toward feeding hungry children and
perhaps toward supporting some of the small-scale farmers. Perhaps
Shuttleworth's perspective will change after his "ultimate vacation"
in space, when he looks down on our planet and realizes it is a small
world after all.</LD>

<HD>Blake Faces a Murder Trial but Not Death</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I can't believe the district attorney's decision not to seek the
death penalty in the Robert Blake case (April 26). Blake allegedly
committed a textbook capital murder case, with premeditation,
conspiracy and lying in wait.</LD>
<LD>   Was it because of his age? I don't remember an age limit in that
section of the penal code. Was it politically motivated, to avoid
risking the loss of a high-profile case because some juror might vote
not guilty to avoid having Blake sentenced to death? If so, then the
D.A. just validated the "jury nullification" theory used in the O.J.
Simpson case: The full force of the criminal justice system isn't
applied to society's elite--just to the little people.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Robert Blake: A Good Guy/Bad Guy Awaits the Role of a
Lifetime," Commentary, April 26: I found the bit on Blake's resume by
David Slavin and Bruce Kluger to be in poor taste. I can appreciate
the satirical view of our celebrity trials. In fact, I very much
regret the lack of satirical writing in general in this country.
Unfortunately, we tend to take ourselves too seriously for satire to
be popular. Nevertheless, we're talking about murder here.</TE>
<TE>   It seems to me that this piece, although amusing, does more to
trivialize the crime than to poke fun at our obsession with
celebrity.</TE>

<LD>"Catholic Lite Won't Heal Those Wounds" (Commentary, April 26) has it
all wrong. This is not a crisis of fidelity at all, as George Weigel
insists. Laying the blame on three decades of wayward seminarians is
a smoke screen at best. The real issue is the systematic, determined
effort of the upper echelons of the Catholic hierarchy to coddle and
shield those who engaged in immoral, criminal behavior and, in so
doing, to perpetuate the problem.</LD>
<LD>   The church's presumed effort (too little, too late) to find
solutions to the crisis only serves to deflect attention from the
evil complicity of arrogant, powerful and hypocritical men like
Cardinal Bernard Law, who for years betrayed the victims--the very
people they had a mandate to protect. This is the "crisis" the
Vatican should be looking at.</LD>
<LD>   John Crowther</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With insightful clarity, Weigel addressed the grave misconceptions
plaguing media coverage of this admittedly shameful scandal in our
contemporary church and pointed out the critical distinction between
pedophilia and sexual misconduct. He rightly attributes moral decline
to the cultural epidemic of low moral expectations rather than to the
more popular spin that too much self-control is a bad thing.</TE>
<TE>   I hope that American Catholics especially take note of his
inspired understanding of the role of celibacy in the priesthood.
Trying to discuss the vow of celibacy with people who don't
acknowledge the sanctity of a priest's union with Christ is like
arguing abortion with people who simply don't believe that life
begins at conception. There is no common ground for dialogue.</TE>

<LD>Re "Senate Debates Permanent Demise of 'Death Tax,'" April 24: I used
to dislike the term "death tax," but now I have come to see that it
is not inappropriate, since dead people don't need money. If one
believes at all in furthering equality of opportunity, it is a good
tax. Well-off parents can, while alive, provide their offspring with
enormous advantages; why add to this by fostering a class of
hereditary wealthy?</LD>
<LD>   The children of nonaffluent but hard-working parents should not be
disadvantaged merely because their parents did not make the
accumulation of money their primary goal in life.</LD>

<HD>Disease Researchers Neglecting World Poor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANKLIN HUANG and MATT STREMLAU</AU>
<BD>Franklin Huang is a medical student at Washington
University School of Medicine. Matt Stremlau is a molecular biology
PhD candidate at Harvard Medical School.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of the 300 or so candidates seeking doctorates in molecular biology
at Harvard Medical School, only two are studying malaria, a disease
that kills at least one African every 30 seconds.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the paltry level of interest expressed by today's
young scientists in curing diseases that affect the poorest of the
poor is not surprising. Each year, only about 5% of the $60 billion
spent worldwide on biomedical research targets the illnesses that
most affect 95% of the world's poorest populations, according to
Nature magazine.</LD>
<LD>   This long-standing trend is not only ethically egregious, it also
is bad economic policy. U.S. scientists are one group that should
take the lead in combating infectious diseases prevalent in
developing countries.</LD>
<TE>   Biomedical researchers in particular must take a stronger role in
addressing the deepening global health crisis--a crisis born more of
a lack of attention than a dearth of scientific solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Several factors cause this trend to be so entrenched within our
nation's top scientific institutions. Most significantly, governments
have failed to create the financial incentive essential to
encouraging researchers to tackle diseases that are endemic in poor
countries.</TE>
<TE>   No new anti-tuberculosis drugs have been developed in 30 years.
Except in the case of HIV research, most funding is allocated for
health issues confronted primarily by wealthy countries. Each year,
spending on malaria research amounts to $84 million, or $42 per
fatality, but funding for asthma research is about $800 million
annually, or $500 per fatality. Although asthma is a serious health
concern, estimates suggest that malaria saps the collective economic
strength of sub-Saharan Africa by as much as 50% a year.</TE>
<TE>   A second reason that scientists ignore many of the globe's most
pressing public health issues stems from the way we are trained. Most
graduate programs focus almost exclusively on a limited group of
health problems, such as cancer or genetic disorders, common in
developed economies. Malaria and tuberculosis are rarely discussed in
the classrooms where doctors and researchers are trained.</TE>
<TE>   Graduate school curricula should reflect global needs and
realities by designing classes that prepare students to eradicate
diseases that threaten the health of the majority of the world's
population. Without this commitment to training truly globally minded
scientists, a vaccine for malaria may never be developed.</TE>
<TE>   The international scientific community must dramatically increase
its financial and institutional support for young scientists who wish
to heal the damage that infectious disease inflicts on the planet's
most war-racked and impoverished nations. Though it might be
difficult to persuade the few nations that would contribute to pony
up the $28 billion recently recommended by the World Health
Organization, the dividends from such an investment in increased
productivity and lives saved would be incalculable.</TE>

<LD>Here's a basic rule of politics: If you know what you're doing, do
more of it. But if you don't know what you're doing, do less.</LD>
<LD>   George W. Bush has mastered half of that wisdom. By sticking to
tried-and-true economics, the president looks smart indeed as the
economy comes roaring back. But by venturing out into
make-it-up-as-he-goes-along foreign policy, Bush looks amateurish at
best.</LD>
<LD>   Start with what Bush knows well: growing the economy. He
campaigned on a tax cut, signed it into law last June and has stuck
with it since. Yes, the economy softened in 2001, but that was a
carry-over from the Nasdaq bubble-popping that began the year
before--combined, of course, with the shock of Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   Yet Democrats were quick to attack Bushonomics. "Not only did the
tax cut fail to prevent a recession," declared Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle on Jan. 4, "it probably made the recession worse."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, this blip of a recession was probably the mildest in
history. And on Friday, Bush's stay-the-tax-cut course was
vindicated; the Commerce Department announced that the economy grew
by a whopping 5.8% in the first quarter of 2002. Now, one might say
that cutting taxes, then holding fast to that position, is not
exactly the greatest intellectual achievement of all time. But that's
the point: If something works, why fool with it?</TE>
<TE>   Now to foreign policy. Immediately on Sept. 11, Bush was
transformed from semi-isolationism to hyperinternationalism; early
and easy success in Afghanistan left him convinced he could eradicate
terrorist evil around the world.</TE>
<TE>   At its best, conservatism is a synonym for caution. But Bush
ignored the accumulated lessons of successful statecraft for
democracies, which emphasize building alliances and invoking
international law. His hot-tempered and ill-considered
rhetoric--throwing around historically loaded words such as "crusade"
and "axis of evil"--bespoke a recklessness that was guaranteed to
backfire.</TE>
<TE>   At home in Texas, Gov. Bush knew the danger of premature
polarization; he would never have walked into the rambunctious Texas
Legislature and snarled, "You're either with me or against me."</TE>
<TE>   But that's precisely the ultimatum he has delivered to the world.
Bush thought he was going to start a stampede against Saddam
Hussein's Iraq, but instead the herd of international opinion
scattered every which way.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Israeli-Palestinian fight has erupted yet
again. The 43rd president, having pretended for more than a year that
he would handle that issue differently from his predecessors--by not
even attempting to handle it--now finds himself desperate to catch up
with events and cobble something together. Call it post-hoc ad hoc.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has built his new approach on two dubious pillars: Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, whom Bush virtually alone in the world
describes as "a man of peace" and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, leader
of a country that seems to be, at best, an ambivalent American ally.
If Sharon and Abdullah are the twin peaks of administration policy,
it's little wonder that the rest of the world rejects Bush's
distinction between black hats and white hats.</TE>
<TE>   The president inherited a set of free-marketish ideas about
running the economy that has served him well because it served his
predecessors well. But he invented, on the spot, an absolutist and
unilateralist "doctrine" about fighting certain flavors of foreign
evil that is unlikely to work, because going it alone rarely works.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there's always room for innovation. But those who seek to
improve on standard operating procedure should begin by knowing more
than those who went before them.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in foreign policy as opposed to economic policy, Bush
dismisses the past. He doesn't want to transcend tradition; he wants
to simply ignore it.</TE>

<HD>Will China's Next Leaders Be Puppets of the Old Guard?</HD>
<DH>Prospects for genuine political reform depend on a real
transfer of power to the new generation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILLIP C. SAUNDERS and JING-DONG YUAN</AU>
<BD>Phillip C. Saunders and Jing-dong Yuan, adjunct
professors at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, teach
Chinese politics and conduct research on Asian security issues.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao's visit to the United States this
week, his first, has put the spotlight on the coming Chinese
leadership transition. But will the changeover be a true transfer of
power?</LD>
<LD>   Most analysts believe that Hu, whom Deng Xiaoping selected as the
core of the fourth-generation leadership, will take over Jiang
Zemin's positions as general secretary of the Communist Party this
fall and as president of China in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   But regardless of which younger leaders are selected for
membership in the Politburo Standing Committee, the inner circle in
Chinese politics, and for top government offices, the real question
is whether Hu and the fourth-generation leaders will be given the
authority to govern China. If third-generation leaders Jiang, Li Peng
and Zhu Rongji try to run China from retirement, prospects for
genuine political reform in China will decrease dramatically.</LD>
<TE>   In an authoritarian system, top leaders are able to bend political
institutions to their will and wield power with few restraints.
Strong political institutions that can resist such influence enhance
prospects for genuine political reform.</TE>
<TE>   When Deng returned to power for the third time in the late 1970s,
he tried to increase political stability in China by
institutionalizing the political system and the leadership succession
process. Key measures included mandatory retirement ages, term limits
and efforts to groom future leaders by appointing promising young
cadres to key party and state positions.</TE>
<TE>   Deng's reluctance to completely exit the political arena derailed
this process. When serious policy differences emerged between Deng's
generation of revolutionaries and the younger, more bureaucratic
leaders, Deng sacked the younger leaders. He undercut his goal of
increasing the importance of political institutions over individuals.
It was Deng and the retired octogenarian leaders who called the shots
during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, not those who formally
held party and state positions.</TE>
<TE>   Will history repeat itself and stall political
institutionalization? Three scenarios are likely for the leadership
transition.</TE>
<TE>   In the first, Jiang, Li and Zhu would retire, allowing Hu and the
fourth generation of leaders to exercise real power. This would
strengthen Chinese political institutions and the rule of law by
bestowing political authority by virtue of institutional position
rather than individual power.</TE>
<TE>   Under this scenario, it is possible--though by no means
guaranteed--that Hu might undertake the political reforms
third-generation leaders discussed but never implemented.</TE>
<TE>   In the second scenario, Jiang and Li would try to place proteges
in positions of power to maintain their political influence after
retirement. Jiang has been trying unsuccessfully for the last two
years to place his confidant Zeng Qinghong in a more senior position
to balance and constrain Hu. Here, the third generation would
continue to play an active political role by manipulating the balance
of power among fourth-generation leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In the third scenario, Jiang would retire from his party and
government positions but remain chairman of the Central Military
Commission, the ultimate guarantor of Communist Party power in China.
The backing of the army would give Jiang the power base to intervene
in a range of political issues.</TE>
<TE>   The scenario that materializes will have a significant influence
on China's political development. If Jiang attempts to hold on to his
formal positions or to wield power informally after retirement, Li
and Zhu probably will follow suit. This would undercut the
fourth-generation leaders, weaken political institutions and damage
prospects for significant reforms.</TE>
<TE>   The most significant achievement of China's third generation of
leaders has been to maintain political stability and continue the
economic reforms that have produced rapid growth and rising living
standards. At this stage, however, the most important contribution
they could make toward China's future would be to strengthen the
nation's political institutions by giving up power gracefully.</TE>

<HD>Blame Church Arrogance, Not Oversexed Society</HD>
<DH>The Catholic clergy might be best served by reciting the
wisdom of Pogo: 'We have met the enemy and he is us.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While it might appear to be sweet revenge for the Inquisition, it is
best to resist the impulse to burn some Catholic priests--and the
cardinals who covered up their criminal activities--at the stake. Be
thankful that we live in a secular, pluralistic society in which the
heavy hand of the sanctimonious is restrained.</LD>
<LD>   But it would be helpful if the church's leaders, from the pope on
down, for once would assume accountability for their lengthy history
of covering up scandals rather than shifting the blame to
homosexuality or a too-permissive secular society.</LD>
<LD>   The church's recent equation of homosexuality with pedophilia or
any other sex crime is a slander against a subset of the national
population that shows no greater inclination to sexually criminal
behavior than the heterosexual population. Even within the cloistered
Catholic priesthood there are plenty of charges that priests are
molesting women, such as in the case of an Iowa priest accused of
groping a female parishioner after an evening Mass. The woman sued
the priest, the bishop and other church officials for concealing the
priest's history of sexual abuse. This same priest was later accused
of sexual advances toward a 13-year-old girl at a Catholic school,
but the case was dropped when he resigned.</LD>
<TE>   The larger problem is one of arrogance. The church presumes to act
as the guardian of our morals by telling the rest of us--including
non-Catholics--how to live, as if the attainment of a healthy
sexuality is a simple matter of shunning the texts and images the
church finds objectionable and has so often managed to have banned.</TE>
<TE>   D.H. Lawrence's "Lady Chatterley's Lover," which was banned in
this country until 1959, could not possibly have led priests to
pedophilia since that is hardly the focus of this or most erotic
works. Nor could the "sacrilegious" art at the Brooklyn Museum--so
viciously attacked by Catholic leaders--in any way explain the
degenerate behavior of priests who were not allowed to view the
paintings.</TE>
<TE>   To indulge the wrath of the censor is to deny that sex crimes such
as pedophilia are the result of mental illness, a terrifying disorder
that strikes Catholics as well as atheists, the married and the
celibate, heterosexuals and gays. Indeed, the loudest moral censors
often are hiding severely destructive compulsions.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, it was Father Bruce Ritter, director of the massive
Catholic Church-supported Covenant House for runaway children, whose
alleged sexual abuse was covered up by the church but eventually
exposed to the world.</TE>
<TE>   Ritter, who had served on the Reagan administration's Commission
on Pornography, was hailed as an "unsung hero" by President Reagan in
his 1984 State of the Union address and in 1990 was visited by
President George Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Those ringing endorsements should give pause to those who now
celebrate faith-based charities as the panacea for a troubled social
order.</TE>
<TE>   Months after meeting with Bush, Ritter stood accused of having had
sex with a young male in a New Orleans hotel during a break in the
pornography commission hearings. Two other men connected with
Ritter's program also came forth to accuse him of having sex with
them when they were minors, and an investigation by Covenant House's
board of directors turned up extensive evidence of sexual misconduct.
Ritter, who had run what the Los Angeles Times called "the largest
child-care agency in the country," was forced to resign in disgrace
from Covenant House.</TE>
<TE>   As one searches for an explanation for why so many priests have
been exposed as child molesters recently, there is no indication that
pornography or other manifestations of a permissive secular world
pushed any of those men of God into their insanity. Indeed, the more
plausible explanation is that they led a life too cloistered from the
ordinary sources of adult sexual stimulation and satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   As the stories of the Bible amply testify, sexual perversion was a
feature of the human experience long before the advent of modern
communications technology. Certainly the history of the Catholic
Church is replete with tales of decadence on the part of priests long
before the allures of the silver screen, cable TV and the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than scapegoat gay men--or sex outside marriage,
pornography, masturbation, short skirts, precocious children,
Hollywood films and so on--the Roman Catholic Church might be best
served by reciting the wisdom of Pogo at every vespers: "We have met
the enemy and he is us."</TE>
<TE>   Pedophilia is a serious crime, irrevocably damaging young lives.
The problem here is not that the church had sick priests but rather
that their evil ways were permitted to fester by the indifference of
corrupt cardinals and bishops who then and now blame everyone but
themselves for the terrible harm that has been done.</TE>

<HD>Gigante Breaks New Ground</HD>
<DH>Retail: Construction begins on popular Mexican-owned
supermarket in South-Central L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years after rioters torched shops on the site, a growing Mexican
supermarket chain broke ground Monday on a store to anchor a
$10-million shopping center in South-Central Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Efforts to rebuild the shopping center at Vermont and Slauson
avenues had been plagued by false starts, with Vons and ValuePlus
supermarkets pulling out of development plans.</LD>
<LD>   In 1998, Rocky Delgadillo, then Los Angeles deputy mayor for
economic development, suggested bringing the Gigante supermarket
chain to the site. The neighborhood, heavily African American at the
time of the riots that began April 29, 1992, is largely Latino now.</LD>
<TE>   "Part of my job was to advise on what makes the most sense," said
Delgadillo, who is now city attorney. "I knew Gigante was going to
come into L.A. in a big way."</TE>
<TE>   The project was developed by the Vermont Slauson Economic
Development Corp., a nonprofit organization that seeks economic
growth for South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The development corporation struck a deal with Gigante, a
billion-dollar Mexican-owned supermarket chain widely popular in
Mexico that entered the U.S. market through Los Angeles in 1999.
Gigante has stores in Arleta, Pico Rivera and Covina, said Justo
Frias, president of Gigante USA Inc., based in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   A 50,000-square-foot Gigante store at the shopping center at
Vermont and Slauson is scheduled to open in December and will be the
first store the supermarket chain builds from the ground up in
Southern California. The construction cost for the store is $3.5
million, and the chain has made an additional $3-million investment
in inventory and supplies, Frias said.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations with Gigante took two years. In the meantime, the
supermarket became unionized, making it easier for the project to win
support in City Hall, Delgadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   The Vermont-Slauson center is a $10-million endeavor the nonprofit
corporation has been working to piece together for the last 10 years,
said Marva Smith Battle-Bey, president of the development
corporation.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Community Development Bank, Genesis L.A. and the
mayor's office helped finance the deal. A 4,000-square-foot Burger
King franchise and 5,000 square feet of office space for the
development corporation will fill out the shopping center.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm relieved," Battle-Bey said. "It means other corporations are
taking an interest in the neighborhood. We'll just go to the people
who want to be here."</TE>

37 cents, posted for the same period last year.</LD>
<LD>   Sales increased 3% to $446.7million.</LD>
<LD>   Beckman's chairman, John P. Wareham, noting that the markets the
company is in are generally favorable, forecast second-quarter sales
to grow about 6% and net earnings to jump as high as 19%.</LD>
<TE>   The strongest-performing product lines last quarter were robotic
automation and genetic analysis and immunodiagnostics. Robotic
automation and genetic analysis sales grew 20%, while
immunodiagnostics sales grew 8%.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Costa Mesa-based Ceradyne Inc., a manufacturer of
technical ceramics, said net income for the first quarter was
$579,000, or 7cents a share, a 51% decline from $1.2 million, or 14
cents, for the first quarter of 2001.</TE>

<HD>Apartments Go Outside the Box, Into Courtyards</HD>
<DH>Hacienda-like complexes make a comeback as more renters
seek out interesting architecture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS NEWMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After nearly seven decades of neglect, the traditional Los Angeles
courtyard apartment complex appears to be experiencing a revival,
with new projects inspired by the classic, hacienda-like complexes
springing up in Pasadena, South Pasadena and West Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   If courtyard complexes catch on with renters, the building type
could challenge accepted notions of apartment design at a time when
an increasing number of middle-class professionals choose to live in
urban locations and sometimes pay a premium for interesting
architecture.</LD>
<LD>   Courtyard housing reflects the city-planning goals of "new
urbanism," a decade-old doctrine that promotes pedestrian-oriented
neighborhoods as an alternative to urban sprawl, said architect
Elizabeth Moule, co-principal of Pasadena-based Moule &amp; Polyzoides
Architecture and Urbanism.</LD>
<TE>   "Courtyard projects are a more rational way of housing people and
accommodating urban growth, while providing a better quality of life
and a better quality of environment than most current multifamily
housing offers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent example of the courtyard revival is the 7
Fountains apartment complex, which opened last month in West
Hollywood. As if to signal the reemergence of courtyard housing from
its antecedents, the 20-unit building stands amid a designated
historical district of courtyard buildings from the 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   The $20-million building developed by Angel's Landing Development
of West Hollywood looks more like a classic Hollywood villa than an
apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   Asymmetrical in shape, 7 Fountains ranges in height from two to
four stories, including two distinctive towers. Apartments are
arranged around two large courtyards, which provide natural light and
ventilation to all units. Each apartment has private entrances at the
front and back, as well as front and rear windows. The garage is
tucked out of sight of passing motorists and pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not look like production housing," said architect
Stefanos Polyzoides, who designed the project with Moule.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the courtyard apartments of the 1920s, 7 Fountains
apartments are "live-work" units that contain home offices, each with
its own door separate from the living area. The units also contain
fiber-optic cabling and other communications wiring.</TE>
<TE>   In the view of Moule and Polyzoides, projects such as 7 Fountains
and other buildings the firm has designed are an alternative to the
undistinguished apartment complexes that Moule calls "six-packs," a
derisive allusion to stacked, identical units. Recent designs include
a small, 10-unit building next to the firm's Pasadena office and a
67-unit complex with Craftsman detail near the future
Mission-Meridian light-rail station in South Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Some renters may be attracted to courtyard housing because it
shares common features with single-family homes, such as private
doors at front and back that provide a sense of protective insulation
from the street, said Berkeley architect Sam Davis, who has designed
courtyard projects in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Courtyards themselves, he said, are "really extended living
rooms." The major courtyard at 7 Fountains, for instance, features a
large, outdoor fireplace that has become an informal social center
for residents, said developer Boyd Willat.</TE>
<TE>   Courtyards allow designers to create unique apartment floor plans,
Polyzoides said. The irregular contours of the 7 Fountains courtyards
at 1414 N. Harper Ave. accommodate the varying sizes and layout of
the units, all of which are different from one another.</TE>
<TE>   Although some developers maintain that apartment buildings with
varying sizes of units are not cost-effective, Polyzoides said his
projects cost only 5% to 10% more than conventional apartments.</TE>
<TE>   Developers of courtyard units must often resign themselves to
building a lower number of units than allowed under zoning.
Courtyards are a "medium-density," low-rise type of housing rarely
containing more than 25 units, Polyzoides said. Building less than
the maximum is contrary to the custom of "maxing out" lots with the
highest possible number of units.</TE>
<TE>   Willat built only 20 of the 38 units allowed for the 7 Fountains
site, which fills two-thirds of an acre. He compensated for the
comparatively small number of units by developing 7 Fountains as a
luxury project with well-above-market rents: $3,500 a month for a
two-bedroom, one-bath unit to $6,500 for a three-bedroom, three-bath
apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond high rents, the project offers other rewards to Willat, a
former film art director. Borrowing a concept from the movies, "you
create spaces that translate into emotion," he said. "This is
architecture that creates a sense of restoration, an antidote to the
metropolitan condition."</TE>
<TE>   One renter who prefers courtyard living to other apartment
alternatives is Jay M. Vogel, a lawyer who recently moved into a
one-bedroom, 11/2-bath unit with a separate office at 7 Fountains.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in New York, Vogel likes the communal character of the
apartments. And having recently ended a long relationship, he said,
"the one thing I did not want was to sequester myself."</TE>
<TE>   Vogel also likes living next to a courtyard. "I like the fact that
you do not get off an elevator into a cold, indiscriminate hallway,"
he said. "When you walk in the courtyard, you are transformed."</TE>
<TE>   Harper Avenue has other attractions for Vogel, such as dog
walking. The street, he said, is "the dog-walking capital of West
Hollywood," adding, "I've met a lot of people that way."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Daewoo Motor Co.'s U.S. sales arm fired about two-thirds of its
workers, anticipating that the unit would be excluded from assets
General Motors Corp. will acquire after the auto makers sealed their
long-anticipated deal Monday.</LD>
<LD>   About 105 of Daewoo Motor America's 165 employees were let go last
week, said Gary Connelly, vice president of the Compton-based unit.
The 60 remaining will keep their jobs until "the transition between
Daewoo Korea and GM is finalized." Daewoo Motor America has closed
all its field offices.</LD>
<LD>   GM and other investors agreed Monday to buy some assets of Daewoo
for $1.17 billion in cash and assumed debt, forming a new auto
company and ending a four-year effort to salvage the insolvent South
Korean auto maker.</LD>
<TE>   The world's largest auto maker and unnamed business partners
agreed to invest $400 million for a 67% stake in the new venture,
said Nick Reilly, head of GM's Daewoo transition team. Daewoo's
creditors, led by the Korea Development Bank, will invest $197
million cash for a 33% share.</TE>

<HD>Personal Income, Spending Growth Slow in March</HD>
<DH>Economy: The 0.4% gains are the smallest in three months,
indicating a cooling at the start of the second quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. personal income and spending grew in March at the slowest rates
in three months, suggesting the economy began to cool entering the
second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The 0.4% gain in income followed a 0.6% increase in February, the
Commerce Department said. Spending also rose 0.4% after a 0.6% gain,
as purchases of durable goods such as appliances, nondurables and
services slowed.</LD>
<LD>   The rise in spending was the smallest since a 0.1% increase in
December. The gain in income also was the weakest this year.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, the report showed businesses are keeping prices
in check to maintain sales. The personal consumption price index
excluding food and energy, an inflation gauge watched by Federal
Reserve policymakers, rose 0.1% for a third straight month.</TE>
<TE>   Few signs of price pressures and the slower pace of spending help
explain why the Fed is expected to leave its benchmark overnight bank
lending rate at a 40-year low of 1.75% when it meets next week.
Central bankers, who said they expect consumer demand to give less of
a boost to the recovery in coming months, have signaled they're
willing to allow the recovery to gather strength.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer spending grew at a 3.5% rate in the first quarter, as the
economy expanded at a 5.8% pace. First-quarter spending was slower
than the 6.1% rate in the final three months of last year.</TE>
<TE>   The economy probably will slow to a 3.4% growth rate this quarter
and stay close to that pace in the second half of the year, according
to the latest consensus estimate of the Blue Chip Economic Indicators
survey of about 50 economists.</TE>
<TE>   Spending on durable goods such as autos and other expensive items
intended to last three or more years rose 0.5% in March after a 1.4%
surge in February. Spending on nondurable goods increased 0.2%, half
the February gain. Services spending, which accounts for half of the
total, rose 0.5% after climbing 0.6% in February.</TE>
<TE>   Disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased
0.5% in March after rising 0.7% a month earlier, the government said.
Income slowed because wages and salaries rose 0.2% in March, half the
February increase.</TE>

<HD>Survey Probes Enron Connections</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Senior White House officials are asked to
report any contacts with company officials last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's chief lawyer asked senior White House officials
Monday to report any contacts they may have had with representatives
of Enron Corp. between Bush's inauguration and Dec. 2 last year, when
the energy company filed for bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   Alberto R. Gonzalez, Bush's White House counsel, sent a memorandum
to more than 100 senior aides in the White House and White House
agencies instructing them to cooperate with the survey, intended to
answer questions that Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), sent to the
White House on March 27.</LD>
<LD>   Lieberman is chairman of the Senate Government Affairs Committee,
which is investigating Enron.</LD>
<TE>   The White House previously agreed to cooperate with a Justice
Department probe into the Enron collapse.</TE>
<TE>   During a speech in Century City at a fund-raising dinner for
Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr., Bush, in calling
for greater responsibility in the country, made a reference to the
Enron scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are running a corporation, you have a responsibility to
your employees and your shareholders," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, the onetime highflying energy company, plunged into Chapter
11 less than a month after reporting that it had overstated its
earnings by almost $600 million since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The survey asks the officials whether during the period between
Jan. 20 and Dec. 2, 2001, Enron representatives asked had them for
help "of any kind in connection with the company's financial
difficulties."</TE>
<TE>   They also are being asked whether they had any communications with
Enron related to a number of federal agencies, and whether they had
any communications with any official or employee of the agencies
relating to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The agencies are the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, the departments of Labor, Commerce and Energy, the
Overseas Private Investment Corp., and the Export-Import Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The survey was sent to all presidential aides ranked as special
assistant and above, certain aides to Vice President Dick Cheney, the
Council of Economic Advisors, the Council on Environmental Quality,
the Office of Management and Budget, and the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative.</TE>
<TE>   The officials were asked to check "yes" or "no" on a form, or to
discuss the matter with members of the counsel's staff and to return
the completed survey by May 10.</TE>

<HD>Hunt for 'Value' Boosts Stock Funds</HD>
<DH>Mutuals: Despite market uncertainty, investors pump in
$54.7 billion, the highest since the third quarter of 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors' new hunger for "value" shares helped drive stock mutual
fund cash inflows in the first quarter to their best levels in a year
and a half.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a shaky market overall, stock funds took in a net $54.7
billion in cash in the quarter, the highest since the third quarter
of 2000, the Investment Company Institute said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The total was boosted by a $29.3-billion net inflow in March
alone, the best for any month since April 2000, said ICI, the fund
industry's chief trade group.</LD>
<TE>   The funds attracting the most interest are those that focus on
so-called value stocks--shares priced relatively low compared with
underlying fundamentals such as earnings and sales, industry data
show.</TE>
<TE>   The fund cash inflow figures, which measure new purchases minus
redemptions, indicate that many investors are ignoring the continuing
plunge in "growth" stocks such as technology issues--the leaders of
the late-1990s market boom--and have shifted their attention to the
new leaders in the value sectors of the market.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter, value-style funds netted $28.9 billion, far
outpacing the growth and "blend" (a mix of growth and value) fund
styles, according to Financial Research Corp., a consulting firm in
Boston that estimates fund cash flows. It was the highest quarterly
intake for value funds since Financial Research began tracking flows
in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Growth-sector funds, by contrast, got only $3.4 billion in total
net cash in the first quarter, Financial Research said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, bond funds also continued to attract money in March,
while ultraconservative, low-yielding money funds had a big outflow.
Bond funds took in a net $6.8 billion, while money funds had a
$53-billion outflow, some of which may have been related to annual
tax payments by investors.</TE>
<TE>   For stock funds, March's cash inflow was helped by the 3.7% rise
in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index for the month, after February's
slide, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   But even as the market has pulled back in recent weeks, major fund
companies including Fidelity, Vanguard Group, T. Rowe Price Group and
Charles Schwab Corp. say stock funds have continued to attract money,
though not necessarily on March's pace.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab had a net inflow of $1.3billion this month for stock
portfolios in its fund "supermarket" through last week, versus an
inflow of $3.1 billion for all of March. Vanguard estimates an inflow
of $2.2billion this month, versus $4.6billion in a "standout" March,
according to spokesman Brian Mattes.</TE>
<TE>   At T. Rowe Price, value funds and other conservative stock funds
are pacing "very strong inflows" in April, said spokesman Steve
Norwitz.</TE>
<TE>   Fund purchases are typically strong in the first quarter, fueled
by retirement-plan funding, but this year's solid inflows "offer
evidence that investor sentiment is becoming positive" toward the
market, or at least toward key sectors, said Chris Brown, director of
research at Financial Research.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say heavy purchases of value funds are perpetuating
the gains in stocks in those sectors, especially for small-cap value
stocks that have been in the market's sweet spot for two years.</TE>
<TE>   "The strong performance of mid- and small-cap value stocks is now
being driven more by the flow of funds than by any fundamental
improvement [in the companies]," Thomas McManus, market strategist at
Banc of America Securities in New York, said in a recent research
report.</TE>
<TE>   The average small-cap value fund was up 9.8% and the average
mid-cap value fund was up 3.8% year-to-date through Friday, according
to Morningstar Inc. By contrast, the average large-cap growth fund
was down 9.1%.</TE>
<TE>   In the late-1990s and early 2000 it was large-cap growth stocks,
and funds, that led the market as investors piled in--until the
technology-stock bubble burst.</TE>
<TE>   Value-oriented fund companies whose sales surged in this year's
first quarter, according to Financial Research, include American
Funds, which took in a net $12.6billion in its stock and bond funds
combined, versus $4 billion in the first quarter of 2001; Dodge &amp;
Cox, which took in $2.6 billion, versus $715 million; and small-cap
value specialist Royce Funds, which took in a net $1.3 billion,
versus $391 million.</TE>

<HD>Gas Supplies Manipulated, Report Says</HD>
<DH>Energy: Senate study finds refineries cut production and
increase exports to boost prices, especially in California. Industry
disputes claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The gasoline business is dominated by a handful of oil companies that
can manipulate supplies to increase prices and profits, and
California is a prime spot for such maneuvers, congressional
investigators said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A 396-page report by the Democratic staff of the Senate permanent
investigations subcommittee does not accuse oil companies of
violating federal antitrust laws, but notes that when only a few
players control supply, then those companies have enormous power to
control prices. The problem is worsened by the closure of dozens of
refineries during the last 20 years, the report said.</LD>
<LD>   "In a number of instances, refiners have sought to increase prices
by reducing supplies," said the report, commissioned in June by Sen.
Carl Levin (D-Mich.), who chairs the subcommittee. The report, citing
internal oil company documents from the 1990s, contends that refiners
employ a variety of strategies to boost prices, including reducing
refinery production and exporting supplies out of the country.</LD>
<TE>   Levin ordered the investigation, which is the subject of hearings
today and Thursday, when a second summer of gasoline price spikes
plagued the Midwest. This year, prices jumped again across the
country as crude oil prices leaped; on Monday, the U.S. average price
for a gallon of self-serve regular gasoline was $1.393, down about a
penny from last week but up nearly 29 cents since early February, the
Energy Department said.</TE>
<TE>   The oil industry disputed the subcommittee report's findings,
arguing that gasoline prices are set largely by market forces,
including supply, demand and competition. Some of the blame for
gasoline price spikes can be laid on government regulation, which
requires more than a dozen gasoline formulas to fight air pollution
in different parts of the country, said John Felmy, chief economist
of the American Petroleum Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "There are conditions in the market that have led to a reduction
in the number of refineries. Our point is what's caused that is
government regulation and not any attempt by firms to merge and
increase concentration," Felmy said. California's prices are some of
the highest and most volatile in the nation because the gasoline
business here is particularly concentrated, with the top four
refiners controlling nearly 80% of the refining capacity and the top
six refiners operating about 85% of the retail outlets in the state,
the report said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, California is an island in the gasoline world,
consuming since 1996 a unique cleaner-burning gasoline that is
produced by few refineries outside the state. The California
refineries, running at full production, are barely able to satisfy
the state's 1-million-barrel-per-day appetite for gasoline and
frequently must rely on expensive imports to keep California
motorists supplied, the report stated. (The gasoline market in
California is the second-biggest in the world, tied with Japan for
the No. 2 spot after the United States as a whole.)</TE>
<TE>   In such a situation, any slight supply disruption is enough to
send prices soaring, but at times, the report contended, prices are
kept high by other means.</TE>
<TE>   The report cited industry documents from unnamed companies that
indicate some West Coast refiners routinely sell gasoline out of
state, even at a loss. One document, produced by an unnamed refiner,
said the company planned to export gas to "improve market conditions"
and that the firm was willing to "take [a] hit on price to firm up
market."</TE>
<TE>   The report also included a 1996 presentation to senior Arco
managers outlining a strategy to export gasoline so a surplus would
not develop in California. A spokesman for BP, which now owns Arco,
said that the document was a consultant report never acted upon by
Arco, adding that the company does not export gasoline out of
California.</TE>
<TE>   Because so much gasoline is sold in California, any price increase
is unusually costly to the state's economy, the report said, pegging
the toll of a 1-cent increase in the price of a gallon of gasoline at
$420,000 per day, or $153 million per year.</TE>

<HD>Man Behind the Music Shake-Up</HD>
<DH>Probe: Grammy chairman quietly oversaw the review that led
to Michael Greene's resignation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a quiet, little-known record producer from Nashville who
united the Grammy board to oust powerful President C. Michael Greene.</LD>
<LD>   Grammy Chairman Garth Fundis had been among Greene's strongest
supporters until this month, when he decided to call an emergency
board meeting to address sexual harassment allegations against the
controversial Grammy chief.</LD>
<LD>   The behind-the-scenes battle climaxed Saturday when Greene
suddenly resigned with an $8-million severance buyout approved within
hours by 38 trustees who had flown in from 12 chapters across the
nation to attend the unprecedented meeting.</LD>
<TE>   Fundis released a statement Sunday saying that an independent
investigation had cleared Greene of any wrongdoing--but never said
why Greene was stepping down. On Monday, Greene said goodbye to his
staff at the Santa Monica headquarters of the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences and left the building.</TE>
<TE>   Many questions surround Greene's sudden exit, but probably the
biggest is how Fundis was able to pull off the coup.</TE>
<TE>   Greene was well-known throughout the industry for his autocratic
style, which never had been challenged in his 14 years on the job,
Grammy sources said. Critics usually quit or were forced out, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Garth deserves a medal for this," said Spectacor Group head Adam
Sandler, a former vice president at the Grammy organization. "He went
into that life-sucking vortex of the old academy and stood up and did
the right thing--and emerged with his reputation and his soul
intact."</TE>
<TE>   Fundis, who is an unpaid volunteer at the nonprofit group,
declined to comment--except to ask that The Times "please" not write
a story about him. That is true to form, say longtime friends and
associates.</TE>
<TE>   They describe Fundis as a shy, private man without a political
bone in his body, a music lover who took on the Grammy chairmanship
with the hope that he might be able to help the artistic community.
He owns a small studio in Nashville and has produced records for such
country stars as Don Williams, Trisha Yearwood and Alabama. Fundis is
known for his methodical and introspective way of dealing with
artists and their egos.</TE>
<TE>   Fundis' life, however, changed July 25 after he received a letter
from attorney Gloria Allred saying that she was about to file a
lawsuit against the academy. According to the letter, Greene
allegedly had battered and sexually harassed her client, Jill Marie
Geimer, an executive who ran the academy's human resources
department.</TE>
<TE>   Greene denied the allegations, and the academy attempted to
resolve the matter quietly. By November, however, Fundis advised the
board to pay Geimer $650,000. That followed a settlement conference
at which Geimer's lawyers presented accusations involving at least
two other female executives whom Greene allegedly harassed and forced
out of the organization during the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Fundis advised the board to hire a professional private
investigator to look into harassment allegations involving Greene.
The investigator interviewed dozens of employees and put together a
report, which was delivered several weeks ago to an advisory
committee run by Fundis.</TE>
<TE>   Grammy sources said Fundis notified Greene that he intended to fly
in the board for an emergency trustee meeting to address the report's
findings. Two weeks ago, members of the advisory committee suggested
to Greene that he should consider resigning before the board met--an
offer he rejected, Grammy sources said.</TE>
<TE>   A behind-the-scenes battle broke out between Greene and the
advisory committee run by Fundis. Grammy sources say Greene began
telling his staff and trustees that Fundis was out to get his job.</TE>
<TE>   Music sources in Nashville say the standoff cost the unpaid
chairman time and money. They say Fundis put his business on hold and
spent hours trying to negotiate a solution.</TE>
<TE>   The longer the showdown went on, the uglier it got, according to
people familiar with the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Because Greene had been interviewed by the investigator, he was
aware of the allegations that might be raised in the report's
findings. In the days leading up to Saturday's meeting, Greene's
attorneys told the academy that he might sue if any information from
the report became public, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Fundis held firm in his pledge to present the results to the board
Saturday--with the inference that the board would follow with a vote
on Greene's fate, Grammy sources said. Greene's attorneys entered
into negotiations Thursday and arrived at an exit deal by late Friday
night, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Fundis informed the board that Greene would be present
for the report's findings and planned to resign. After Greene gave
his resignation speech and left the room, the board approved his
buyout.</TE>
<TE>   Those who know Fundis applauded his handling of the shake-up.
"Garth is a very fair, stand-up guy," RCA Nashville Chairman Joe
Galante said. "I've known him 17 years. This was a tough situation,
but I guarantee he did his homework before taking any action. The
thing he cares the most about is the truth, not political innuendo.
The guy is a true gentleman."</TE>

<HD>ICN Awards Chief $33.1 Million</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Bonus for Milan Panic's role in spinoff of
Ribapharm draws criticism from dissident shareholders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Milan Panic, facing a proxy contest next month that may end his
42-year-old reign at ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., won't be walking away
from the drug company without a fight. Or a handsome payoff.</LD>
<LD>   Panic, 72-year-old chairman and chief executive of the Costa Mesa
company, was awarded a $33.1-million bonus earlier this month for his
role in the recent spinoff of Ribapharm Inc., which makes the
hepatitis drug Ribavirin.</LD>
<LD>   ICN officials said Panic did not receive stock in Ribapharm, which
began selling shares to the public April 12. ICN's board awarded the
cash bonus to Panic along with bonuses totaling about $17 million to
12 other executives and directors, according to a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing.</LD>
<TE>   The bonus to Panic, which follows a salary and bonus of about $1.9
million for 2001, was criticized by some observers and shareholders
who have complained about Panic's leadership and excesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this award was egregious and a blatant transfer of
shareholder wealth to executives," said Tim Rankin, assistant
portfolio manager at Franklin Mutual Advisers. Franklin and Iridian
Asset Management, which combined hold more than 10% of ICN shares,
are pressing to secure three board seats at ICN's annual meeting set
for May 29. That would give nonmanagement directors control of the
board.</TE>
<TE>   Panic was unavailable for comment. Alan Charles, ICN's executive
vice president of corporate relations, defended the bonus, saying it
was a reward for Panic's key role in the development of the spinoff.</TE>
<TE>   Charles said the bonuses were in lieu of stock or options in the
new company and that the amount--which was determined after
consultation with compensation specialist Towers Perrin--was not out
of line with the practices of corporate America. He noted that ICN's
board, including three dissidents who were voted in last year,
unanimously approved the bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   But some compensation specialists questioned the amount and the
validity of the large one-time bonus. "The act of splitting off a
company into two pieces is not an act worthy of a bonus at all," said
Graef Crystal, a compensation expert in Las Vegas and a onetime
executive at Towers Perrin.</TE>
<TE>   Ribapharm, which went public at an initial $10 share price, closed
at $9.93 Monday, off 32 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   ICN, a company that Panic founded in 1960, earned $85 million on
sales of $858 million last year. Its stock was down 54 cents Monday,
at $27.05 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the bonus payments probably won't have a material
effect on ICN's balance sheet. ICN has about $700 million in cash,
spokesman Charles said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the bonus is almost certain to draw fire from
dissidents as two sides gird for another tough campaign to win
shareholder votes. Last year, when another group of dissidents sought
Panic's removal, ICN management and its opponents launched an
expensive and bitter public campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Panic has suggested he is willing to step down from his executive
posts if the board adopts a succession plan that he has been involved
with drafting. "He's getting tired of the bricks flying," Charles
said.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Cuts 8 People From Witness List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp., citing "shortcomings" in nine states' proposals for
tough antitrust remedies, Monday dropped eight people from its roster
of defense witnesses it planned to call.</LD>
<LD>   Four Microsoft executives, including Senior Vice President Richard
Fade, and representatives from four other companies, will not be
called to testify against the states' proposals, Microsoft spokesman
Jim Desler said. Chief Executive Steve Ballmer and Group Vice
President Jim Allchin are still on the company's list of eight
potential witnesses.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft's decision to trim its witness list came as hearings on
the states' proposals entered their seventh week before U.S. District
Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The company raised the possibility that the hearings might end
next week.</TE>
<TE>   The company cut the witness list "after reviewing the progress
made so far" and "what we believe are shortcomings in the states'
case," Desler said.</TE>
<TE>   The states, led by California and Iowa, also are challenging a
proposed settlement of the 4-year-old antitrust case between the Bush
administration and the world's largest software maker.</TE>
<TE>   Fade, one of those dropped from the list, acknowledged in
questioning before the hearings' start that Microsoft would benefit
from the settlement by gaining the ability to force computer makers
to surrender patent rights.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Best Buy Inc., Charter Communications Inc.,
August Capital and Avanade Inc. will not be called to testify, Desler
said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Monday, a Qwest Communications International Inc.
executive, Gregg Sutherland, called by Microsoft to rebut testimony
supporting the states' remedies, acknowledged that he didn't know
about the software giant's business plans.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft rose 74 cents to $52.24
on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Northrop Gets Ship Contract</HD>
<DH>Defense: $2.9-billion design program for new destroyer
could lead to construction funding worth $60 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. won a $2.9-billion contract Monday to begin
designing a new generation of destroyers, beating out archrival
General Dynamics Co. for what Pentagon officials described as one of
the most significant Navy programs in decades.</LD>
<LD>   By winning the contract, Century City-based Northrop and its
partner, Raytheon Corp., will not only design the new warship, dubbed
DDX, but also will give the team a leg up in garnering future
contracts for other surface ships that analysts believe could
represent an additional business valued at $60 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The Navy wants a destroyer that would be stealthy, operate with
about a third of the crew now required for similar class ships and
have technologies that would be the foundation for future generations
of warships. The proposed design released publicly by Northrop
depicts a ship riding low in the water. It is devoid of many of the
features of current destroyers and bears some resemblance to Civil
War-era ironclads.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a ship for the information age," said Loren Thompson, a
defense analyst for the Arlington, Va.-based Lexington Institute. "It
could mean tens of billions of dollars over a period of several
decades. This is an impressive win for Northrop and Raytheon."</TE>
<TE>   The Northrop win surprised analysts, however, because General
Dynamics, along with partner Lockheed Martin Corp., was considered
the favorite because it has dominated surface ship construction for
the Navy in recent decades. Lockheed, for instance, has been the
system integrator for a significant portion of the Navy's fleet.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Pentagon announced the winner after the markets
closed, investors began selling General Dynamics based on initial
reports that the company had lost the contract. In trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, General Dynamics fell $2.30 to $95.06 while
Lockheed shares rose slightly to $61.55, up 3cents. Meanwhile,
Northrop shares fell 64cents to $115.99 as Raytheon stock rose 5cents
to $40.06.</TE>
<TE>   While both Northrop and Raytheon executives said the Navy's
decision did not come as a surprise, there was an uncharacteristic
display of jubilation as the chairmen of both companies held a joint
news conference shortly after the announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "Raytheon is absolutely delighted," said Daniel P. Burnham. "This
is a great day for Northrop," said Kent Kresa.</TE>
<TE>   Still, General Dynamics was not left completely out of the
picture. Because Northrop and General Dynamics are the only military
shipbuilders left--Northrop acquired both Litton Industries Inc. and
Newport News Shipbuilding in the last year--the Pentagon took great
pains to make sure that General Dynamics would have some involvement
in the development.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the award, Pentagon officials said that General
Dynamics and its Bath Iron Works Shipyard would become a
subcontractor to Northrop and that the shipyard would be able to
compete for the production contract.</TE>
<TE>   The move "will ensure BIW [Bath Iron Works] will have the ability
to produce a detailed DDX design and build these ships in the
future," the Pentagon said.</TE>
<TE>   For Northrop, the DDX program will be lead by its Ingalls
Shipbuilding Inc. unit in Pascagoula, Miss., where the company will
design, produce and test a prototype. Raytheon's Electronic Systems
unit in El Segundo will lead the development of the ship's
electronics and weapons systems, although much of the work is
expected to be carried out by engineers at its facilities in New
England.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop will use a decommissioned Spruance class destroyer, the
Radford, to test the new technologies developed for the DDX and other
future combat surface ships, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials said the DDX program was akin to the program to
build the next generation of fighter jets, an effort that has a
potential value of $200billion.</TE>
<TE>   The award "marks the beginning of a new family of surface
combatants," said Edward C. "Pete" Aldridge Jr., the Pentagon's chief
of acquisitions. "DDX is the Joint Strike Fighter equivalent for
shipbuilding."</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Universal Posts Record Loss</HD>
<DH>Media: The company took $15.4 billion of write-downs in the
first quarter under U.S. accounting principles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAD MOUAWAD</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal, the world's second-largest media company, had a
record loss in the first quarter as it reduced the value of
acquisitions including Seagram Co. and Canal Plus.</LD>
<LD>   The loss widened to $15.37 billion, or $14.93 a share, from $165
million, or 18 cents, a year earlier, Vivendi spokeswoman Anita
Larsen said.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which reported under generally accepted U.S.
accounting principles for the first time, took $15.4 billion of
write-downs in the first quarter.</LD>
<TE>   In the last 18 months, Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier
made $100 billion in takeovers to turn a 149-year-old French water
business into the owner of a Hollywood studio, the biggest music
company and Europe's No. 1 pay television operator. But Vivendi and
larger rival AOL Time Warner Inc. have seen losses balloon as they
wrote down assets bought when stock markets were soaring.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi shares have fallen 40% this year as investors questioned
Messier's strategy and the former investment banker's ability to
reduce Vivendi's $29 billion of debt. Vivendi's shares closed Monday
at $32.49 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 38 cents.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the Paris-based company reported an $11.8-billion loss
for 2001 under French accounting rules. It indicated at the time it
would take a larger write-down under American accounting rules in the
first quarter to lower the value of the same assets.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner last week reported a $54.2-billion first-quarter
loss, the biggest in U.S. history, as it lowered the value of America
Online Inc.'s purchase last year of Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   To catch up with rivals, Messier spent $30 billion on Seagram and
merged it with Canal Plus, Europe's biggest pay TV company, which he
acquired for $9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Messier agreed to buy the entertainment business of
Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc. in a transaction valued at $10.3
billion. He also agreed to pay $1.5 billion for a 10% stake in
EchoStar Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The company is switching to U.S. accounting principles to make it
easier for U.S. investors and analysts to compare it with peers.
Under new accounting rules, companies must write down the value of
goodwill as soon as it's considered overvalued.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Shares Dive on Debt Worry</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Firm's stock falls 28% to a record low of $2.20.
Bondholders fear it will be reduced to junk-bond status.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI and ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors in debt-laden WorldCom Inc. hammered the company's stock
and bonds Monday over fears that the nation's second-largest
long-distance carrier may be on an irreversible course toward
bankruptcy. The sell-off helped depress the entire telecom sector,
from wireless to local phone companies.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom shares fell 28%, hitting an all-time low of $2.20 on
Monday, before closing at $2.35, down 92 cents on Nasdaq. The 264.9
million shares changing hands made it not only the most active stock
of the day but also the fifth-most active ever.</LD>
<LD>   Meantime, bondholders worried that WorldCom, which operates MCI
Group, will be reduced to junk-bond status and the company will fail
to meet $6.4 billion in debt payments in the next three years,
analysts said. Selling by bondholders knocked the market price of
some of the company's debt securities to less than 50 cents on the
dollar, continuing a plunge that began several weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   "Bondholders are getting burned big time by telecom failures like
Global Crossing, and they're not waiting around to get zero in a
bankruptcy," said Patrick Comack, senior analyst at Guzman &amp; Co. in
Miami. "A lot of people believe that, long-term, WorldCom is maybe
not viable."</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton, Miss., company wouldn't comment on price
fluctuations, but WorldCom executives reiterated that they are "very
confident" in the company's ability to pay back its debt and to meet
its cash-flow targets for the year.</TE>
<TE>   The immediate concern is that WorldCom's debt securities will be
reduced to junk-bond status by rating firms Standard &amp; Poor's and
Moody's Investors Service, both of which have the bonds on review
with downgrades likely. Comack said that reducing the ratings to junk
would kick in provisions forcing the firm to repay $2 billion in
loans within 90 days. That would wipe out the company's $2 billion in
cash on hand and make it difficult to refinance debts over the next
few years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, WorldCom's revenue stream has been "drying up" domestically
in the heat of competition from other carriers, especially from
wireless companies offering one-rate plans for long-distance calling,
said Todd Rosenbluth, an S&amp;P stock analyst not associated with the
ratings side of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were a weak company in a growing industry, or at least in
an industry with light at the end of the tunnel, it would be a better
stock to hold on to," Rosenbluth said. He was surprised by the effect
of the bond market's credit-risk fears, saying: "We didn't expect it
to be this bad this fast."</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P, along with numerous brokerage firms, has recommended for
weeks that investors sell the stock, but many have been bidding down
the price all year as they flee the telecom sector.</TE>
<TE>   In a January report, Scott Cleland of the Precursor Group research
firm called WorldCom "a dead growth model walking." He said the
firm's future is bleak because it has run out of easy cost-reduction
measures and has little chance of growing amid increasing
competition, falling prices and a glut in fiber-optic networks.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Cleland sees little chance the firm would be
purchased because it has a network created through scores of
acquisitions and faces competition from other telecom firms with
assets for sale, such as AT&amp;T Corp., Qwest Communications
International Inc. and Sprint Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect that WorldCom will be able to repay $60 million in
debts due this year, but they say bondholders fear the company won't
be able to pay or refinance debts of $1.6 billion due next year, $2.5
billion due in 2004 and $2.3 billion in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, the firm is expected to write down a big chunk of its
goodwill, the premium over market value that it paid for its
acquisitions. Though up to $30 billion in write-downs will be
noncash--the firm already paid for the purchases--it will cut
shareholder equity from nearly $58 billion at the end of March.</TE>
<TE>   That, Comack said, could violate bank loan clauses that limit debt
to 68% of equity. The firm would have more debt than equity, he
noted.</TE>

<HD>Court Revives Genentech Lawsuit Against Amgen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court Monday revived Genentech Inc.'s 1996 patent
infringement suit against rival Amgen Inc. The dispute involves the
method Amgen uses to produce its blockbuster drug Neupogen, which had
sales of $1.3 billion in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington
said a federal district judge erred when he dismissed the suit in
1999. The appeals court sent the case back to the U.S. District Court
in San Francisco for further proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   Genentech accused Amgen of infringement on three patents covering
a method of producing proteins in bacterial cells. The patents were
based on discoveries made at City of Hope National Medical Center in
the late 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   The appeals court said U.S. District Judge William Alsup's
dismissal of the suit was based on a faulty interpretation of terms
used in the patents. The terms describe the "control region" of genes
that instruct the bacterial cells to produce human proteins.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech spokeswoman Sabrina Johnson said the company was pleased
with the decision. "This allows us to move forward," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen spokesman Jeff Richardson said the company had not seen the
decision and could not comment.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court also upheld the denial of Genentech's request
for Amgen's laboratory notebooks and other internal data to determine
whether there had been infringement.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling comes as Genentech is defending itself in a
breach-of-contract suit by City of Hope over the patents. The
hospital, based in Duarte, claims that Genentech owes it royalties on
drugs made by third parties that licensed the patents from Genentech.</TE>
<TE>   The research by City of Hope that lead to the patents was funded
by Genentech. Shares of Thousand Oaks-based Amgen closed down $1.96
at $51.88 after trading at a 52-week low of $51.50. Shares of
Genentech, based in South San Francisco, fell 25 cents to $35.50.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Is Sued by Ex-Partners</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Court filing by retirees says their pensions
and health benefits are threatened by piecemeal breakup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of retired Arthur Andersen partners has filed a new complaint
against the accounting firm, saying the company's break-up is
jeopardizing their retirement and health benefits.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Chicago,
seeks to prevent Andersen from removing non-compete contracts that
bar partners from leaving to work for other firms.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen's U.S. and international units have been splintering as
the firm tries to survive a criminal indictment related to its audits
of Enron Corp. Andersen also is involved in multiple negotiations to
sell parts of its U.S. business.</LD>
<TE>   The firm's 675 retired U.S. partners say the pending transactions
don't explicitly provide for the pension and health benefits for
retired partners and the spouses of partners who have died.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, jury selection began in the case focusing on Andersen's
alleged role contributing to the bankruptcy of the Baptist Foundation
of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   About 13,000 mostly elderly investors lost $570 million when the
foundation filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999. Andersen was the
foundation's auditor.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen reached a $217-million settlement in March with the
foundation's investors. But the settlement fell through four weeks
later when Andersen said its insurance carrier was unable to pay.</TE>

<HD>Anthem, Trigon Healthcare to Merge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RICHMOND, Va.</DL>
<LD>Managed-care provider Trigon Healthcare Inc. said Monday it has
agreed to be acquired by Indianapolis-based Anthem Inc. for about $4
billion in cash and stock.</LD>
<LD>   Both companies are former nonprofit Blue Cross Blue Shield
providers that operate as for-profit corporations and have a combined
total of about 10 million members. The merged company would rank as
the nation's fourth-largest among publicly traded managed-care health
insurance companies.</LD>
<LD>   Trigon shares leapt more than 17%, or $14.62 a share, closing at
$98.87, while Anthem shares fell almost 6%, or $4.05 a share, to
$66.65. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   By acquiring Richmond-based Trigon, Anthem will gain its first
foothold in the southeastern United States, along with Trigon's
expertise in selling specialty insurance products such as dental and
life insurance plans, said Larry Glasscock, president and chief
executive of Anthem.</TE>
<TE>   The deal reflects a merger trend among Blue Cross Blue Shield
insurers, which are joining forces to become more competitive in the
market. The rising incidence of mergers among Blue Cross and Blue
Shield plans has cut the number of parent companies of Blues to 44
last fall from 63 in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers say the increased size derived
from mergers gives them improved purchasing clout so they can afford
the same expensive computer systems and current medical technology as
the competition.</TE>
<TE>   Trigon has about 2.2 million members and posted revenue of
$3billion in 2001. Anthem has about 8 million members and reported
$10.1 billion in revenue last year.</TE>
<TE>   The deal is expected to close in three to six months, subject to
regulatory approvals.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the deal, Trigon stockholders will receive $30 in
cash and 1.062 shares of Anthem stock for each of their Trigon
shares. That amounts to $105 per share based on Anthem's closing
price Friday of $70.70 a share.</TE>

<HD>SEC Files New Charges Against Teen</HD>
<DH>Securities: Agency says Cole Bartiromo engaged in a
stock-trading scheme that predated sports-betting activities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cole Bartiromo, the Mission Viejo 17-year-old accused of swindling
more than $1 million from investors in an online sports-betting scam,
was charged with a second civil fraud Monday: an Internet
stock-trading scheme that allegedly made him a profit of at least
$91,400 last year.</LD>
<LD>   Federal regulators said Bartiromo bought stock in at least 15
companies, then flooded Internet message services with phony
reports--typically about purported takeovers--in an attempt to drive
the shares higher.</LD>
<LD>   If the stock price rose--and it usually did--Bartiromo would cash
out, regulators said.</LD>
<TE>   "In every instance, Bartiromo also sold his stock prior to the
occurrence of the positive event predicted in his messages," the
Securities and Exchange Commission said in a second amended complaint
against the teen, filed in federal court in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo and his lawyer, David Bayless, could not be reached for
comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's initial suit against Bartiromo, filed in January,
alleged that he took in more than $1 million in a scheme called
Invest Better 2001. The program, which operated in November and
December, promised online wagerers "guaranteed" returns of 125% to
2,500%.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo already has returned $1.2 million, mostly from a Costa
Rican casino.</TE>
<TE>   He could have challenged the addition of the new charges to the
SEC's suit Monday but didn't, said Alexander M. Vasilescu, an agency
attorney working on the case.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged stock scam, a "pump and dump" scheme, took place six
months earlier than the sports- betting program, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   The case is similar to one involving another teenager, Jonathan
Lebed of New Jersey, who agreed in 2000 to repay $285,000 obtained in
what investigators said was a scheme using phony online messages to
drive up stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   From May of last year through early July, Bartiromo traded several
million shares of stock, the suit says. He used an "anonymizer"
service to conceal his identity while sending more than 6,000
messages.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very surprised by the volume of the messages and by the
sophistication," said Nick Monaco, the branch chief for Internet
enforcement at the SEC's southeast regional office in Miami, which
investigated the case.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo was too young to have a brokerage account, but his
father authorized the teen's use of the father's Ameritrade Inc.
online account, depositing $60,000 into it in spring 2001, the SEC
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo mostly bought thinly traded "penny stocks," then
disseminated false information on the Yahoo Finance and Raging Bull
Web sites, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint describes how he posted messages June 9 saying CNBC
had given a $15 "target price" to shares of Call Solutions Inc., then
trading at 7 cents. Other messages said EarthLink Inc. or AOL Time
Warner Inc. would buy Call Solutions in a deal to be announced after
trading June 11. Before trading ended that day, Bartiromo sold his
Call Solutions shares at prices ranging from 12 cents to 25 cents,
the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said Bartiromo tried to influence trading in at least one
big-name stock: Broadcom Corp., the chip firm based in Irvine, a few
miles from Bartiromo's home. The complaint provided no details.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC caught up with Bartiromo July 3, when officials contacted
him and obtained assurances from him--and his father--that he would
stop posting false messages on the Internet, the complaint says.
Despite the promises, the suit contends he posted a round of false
messages July 5.</TE>
<TE>   Vasilescu said the SEC expects to complete the discovery phase of
its suit by June 1 and hopes to work out a settlement by midsummer.
In addition to being required to repay any fraudulently obtained
funds, Bartiromo could be fined.</TE>

<HD>Warehouse Redesign Is a Work of Art</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS NEWMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fulham Co. headquarters in Hawthorne was not much to look at last
year: scuffed white walls, rusting exterior iron bars, aging vinyl
floor tile and water-stained ceilings. In short, the building looked
much like every other warehouse in the city's industrial district.</LD>
<LD>   Today the renovated Fulham building brings such rarely seen
qualities to this no-frills area as natural light, an elaborate color
scheme and a growing collection of Asian art.</LD>
<LD>   "The main thing was to humanize this industrial building and make
it an amiable place" in which to work, said architect Luba
Tomalevska, a partner in L&amp;V Architecture, the Santa Monica firm that
designed the interior.</LD>
<TE>   Visitors enter a carpeted reception area, where they can see a
Chinese painting of a cherry blossom and a roll of embroidered silk
mounted artfully on the wall. Nearby is a pair of Chinese ancestral
portraits. Down the hall is a Japanese kimono in a glass display
case.</TE>
<TE>   Color enlivens the office portion of the 24,000-square-foot
building. Different work areas are set off by different hues,
including rusty red, teal blue and pale green. Beyond aesthetics, the
color scheme has a function, Tomalevska said: blue delineates the
sales offices, red is used for public areas such as the kitchen and
restrooms and green, fittingly, for finance.</TE>
<TE>   The Fulham office also is unusual among warehouses, which often
are cavernous, for its plentiful natural light. The architects
removed the wrought iron from the windows and replaced it with
bar-free security windows. The architects also designed clerestory
windows above the doorways of perimeter offices so light from office
windows can spill into the interior of the building.</TE>
<TE>   Finding yet another way of introducing daylight, the architects
covered a portion of the exterior wall with acid-etched glass blocks,
which fills a conference room with diffused light.</TE>
<TE>   Safety was as much a concern as light: Fulham wanted to relocate
the front entrance away from busy Van Ness Avenue to the side of the
building, and the new glass-brick wall filled in the space of the
former entrance.</TE>
<TE>   The company also was willing to sacrifice some parking for an
unusual feature: an outdoor patio with two small fountains,
landscaping and two umbrella-topped tables. Although such amenities
may be commonplace for Westside entertainment companies, they are
exotic in Hawthorne.</TE>
<TE>   Among the visitors who have appreciated the changes are members of
the Hawthorne Fire Department. "They have been inside every building
in the city, and they have told us that they have never seen
[anything] else like this," said Carolyn Neal, a Fulham operations
manager who served as the company's project manager for the
make-over.</TE>

<HD>Legacy Pulls Out of Planned Pasadena Development</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of delays and growing community opposition, Legacy
Partners has abandoned plans to build a massive residential
development on the site of the former Ambassador College in Pasadena,
the property owner said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The Worldwide Church of God, which owns the 48-acre campus and
other nearby property in western Pasadena, said that Foster
City-based Legacy had decided against renewing a contract with the
church to purchase the property and develop it into about 1,700
housing units.</LD>
<LD>   "In the end, Legacy found the twin pressures of time and financial
investment just too much to make the deal work for their bottom
line," Bernard Schnippert, director of finance and planning for the
church, said in a statement. "This is too bad since the plan is a
good one."</LD>
<TE>   The church said it plans "to move forward with the plan without
Legacy" but also indicated that it would not abandon other options to
develop the property, located near the booming Old Pasadena shopping
and entertainment district. Legacy executives could not be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena City Councilman Steve Madison, who represents the
Ambassador College area, said that he and other city officials were
notified of the developer's decision Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   He said the main reason for Legacy decision was that the developer
and the church were unable to finalize terms. "There were contractual
obligations that were not satisfied," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The project, one of the largest ever proposed for Pasadena, has
undergone major changes since Legacy first announced its intention to
develop the property about three years ago when the economy and
commercial real estate markets were booming.</TE>
<TE>   It was first envisioned as a mixed-use development with a hotel, a
million square feet of office space and housing. But, as the market
for office space and hotel rooms weakened, Legacy shifted gears and
focused on housing as home prices and rents continue to rise across
the area.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the initial support of city leaders, opposition to the
project has grown over concerns about density, traffic and urban
design.</TE>
<TE>   The church closed the Pasadena campus in 1995 as revenue and
church membership fell. The church's property holdings included the
main campus on the west side of the 710 freeway and numerous parcels
south of Old Pasadena. The campus includes several historic buildings
and the Ambassador Auditorium.</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P Skid, at 6 Days, Longest in 19 Months</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Earnings fears, world events continue to weigh on
blue chips. Telecom shares slump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks closed mostly lower Monday, with a key index clocking its
longest losing streak in 19 months.</LD>
<LD>   But the technology sector overall held up better than blue chips,
despite another plunge in shares of telecom giant WorldCom Group.</LD>
<LD>   In other trading, oil rose again, while the dollar was mixed.</LD>
<TE>   On Wall Street, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slumped 10.87
points, or 1%, to 1,065.45, the sixth straight declining session for
the blue-chip barometer. That's the longest losing streak since
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow industrials fell almost 1%, off 90.85 points to 9,819.87.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite index eased 6.96
points, or 0.4%, to 1,656.93 after diving 7.4% last week.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy selling last week had pushed several major indexes to their
lowest levels since October, and the mood failed to improve Monday,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "When we fell below the February lows [last week], it prompted
people to think we have some more work to do on the downside," said
Todd Clark, head of listed trading for Wells Fargo Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are concerned that corporate earnings won't rebound
soon, and that other woes--such as the Middle East situation--will
weigh on stocks in the meantime.</TE>
<TE>   A fundamental issue, many pros say, is that stocks still look
historically high-priced relative to earnings expectations, even
after the declines of recent months.</TE>
<TE>   "This market is as skittish as I have ever seen it," said Bruce
Turner, head of U.S. equity trading for CIBC World Markets. "People
are on edge for any perception of bad news."</TE>
<TE>   Falling stocks outnumbered winners by 17 to 14 on the New York
Stock Exchange and by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   In currency trading, the dollar continued to lose value against
the euro, with 1 euro equaling 90.4 cents, up from 90.2 on Friday.
The euro is at its strongest level since the start of the year,
suggesting that foreign investors have increasingly been selling U.S.
assets to invest elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar also eased slightly against the yen Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices hit a four-week high after OPEC's secretary-general
said the cartel may not vote to increase production when members meet
in June. Near-term crude futures in New York rose 46 cents to $27.57
a barrel.</TE>
<TE>   World oil inventories are big enough to allow consuming nations to
meet demand without higher output from the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries, Ali Rodriguez said, according to
Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   In other commodity trading, gold futures held near the two-year
high reached Friday. Near-term futures slipped 60 cents to $311.20 an
ounce.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, yields rose as the Treasury said it would be
forced to be a net borrower of about $1 billion this quarter because
of disappointing tax receipts. Normally the Treasury is in surplus in
the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year T-note rose to 5.12% from 5.05% Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Among Monday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * The Dow was weighed down by GM, off $1.33 to $63.19; 3M, down
$1.76 to $122.64; and Caterpillar, down $1.26 to $52.89. Boeing,
however, jumped $2.12 to $43.63 after a favorable article in
Barron's.</TE>
<TE>   * WorldCom slumped 92 cents to $2.35 on fears it may be headed for
financial trouble. Other telecom shares slid as well, including SBC

<HD>Nvidia Restatement Raises Net Income for 3 Fiscal Years</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Company's review, in response to a federal
inquiry, results in a $1.3- million increase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW FORDAHL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Graphics chip maker Nvidia Corp. said Monday that it is restating its
financials for fiscal 2000, 2001 and parts of 2002, resulting in a
$1.3-million boost in net income over the period.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Clara-based company, which saw its stock quadruple last
year, announced in February that it had launched an internal review
of its books after federal regulators began an inquiry.</LD>
<LD>   The firm also said it expects to net earnings of $79 million to
$84 million, or 45 cents to 48 cents a share, on sales of $570
million to $580 million in its fiscal first quarter of 2003, which
ended Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts were expecting profit of 42 cents per share on sales of
$534 million, according to a survey by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Nvidia surged $5.06, or more than 16%, to $35.43 in
Monday trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.</TE>
<TE>   Net income for fiscal 2002 will increase about $2.1 million, or 1
cent per diluted share. Earnings for fiscal 20001 will decrease by
about $3.7 million, or 3 cents a share. And profit for fiscal 2000
will increase by about $2.9 million, or 2 cents per share.</TE>
<TE>   The internal investigation was conducted by the company's audit
committee, which is made up of independent members of the board of
directors.</TE>
<TE>   "We were given unlimited access to Nvidia's people and documents,
and without exception all the people at Nvidia cooperated fully,"
said William J. Miller, a committee member.</TE>
<TE>   The restatement resulted from typical mistakes in accounting,
uncertain evidence to support estimates, arguable but good-faith
accounting decisions and past audit adjustments, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Nvidia said Monday that its chief financial officer, Christine
Hoberg, is taking a leave of absence but declined to elaborate. The
company's controller, Mary Dotz, will serve as interim CFO until a
replacement is found.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said a pricing dispute with Microsoft Corp. over
the Xbox gaming console was being submitted to arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft is asking that Nvidia supply chipsets in whatever
quantities ordered by Microsoft and at a lower price than Nvidia is
willing to accept. The software giant also is seeking undisclosed
damages.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer, one of the highest-paid actors on U.S.
television, must pay his former talent agency more than $2 million in
back commissions, a federal appeals court ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, upholding a lower court
ruling, found that Grammer and his production company, Grammnet Inc.,
owed the Artists Agency of Los Angeles the money under a 1995
agreement that renegotiated their contract.</LD>
<LD>   Grammer, who reportedly secured a record $1.6 million per episode
when he signed to renew the NBC hit "Frasier" last year, changed his
contract with Artists in 1995 to reflect the fact that the agency had
failed to win him any major motion picture projects. The deal
extended Grammer's TV and commercial obligations with the agency by
two years but set him free to negotiate his own movie deals.</LD>

<LD>NeoTherapeutics Inc. shares fell 64% as the company said its most
advanced experimental product, the Neotrofin medication for
Alzheimer's disease, didn't work as expected in human testing.</LD>

<LD>   Patients on Neotrofin didn't show a statistically significant
benefit compared with those given a placebo treatment in a 12-week
study. NeoTherapeutics said it is suspending Neotrofin research in
Alzheimer's disease, which will reduce its monthly loss to less than
$1.5 million from $2.3 million.</LD>
<TE>   "We're in no cash crisis right now," said Alvin Glasky, the
company's chief executive. "We're not concerned about the cash
position of the company."</TE>
<TE>   NeoTherapeutics ended 2001 with $7.2 million in cash and

<LD>Ford Motor Co. sold a 5.2% stake in PeoplePC Inc. after the world's
second-largest auto maker canceled its personal computer giveaway
program for employees to reduce costs.</LD>
<LD>   Ford owned 3.22 million PeoplePC shares and had a warrant to buy
an additional 2.86 million at $10 each until July 16, 2003, PeoplePC
said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
stake equaled 5.2% of PeoplePC as of Dec. 31, PeoplePC said. The
stake was worth $611,772, based on the shares rising 2 cents to 19
cents on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   The auto maker had distributed about 166,000 personal computers
and printers to employees through San Francisco-based PeoplePC from
February 2000 until the end of May 2001, when the program was
deferred until the fourth quarter. Ford then canceled the program in
October as sales fell.</LD>
<TE>   Ford shares fell 44 cents to $15.86 on the NYSE. PeoplePC shares
were priced at $10 each in an initial public offering in August 2000.</TE>

<HD>Fair Isaac to Buy Rival HNC Software</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Software company Fair, Isaac &amp; Co. said it would buy smaller rival
HNC Software Inc. for more than $700 million, strengthening business
in analytical products including credit card fraud detection.</LD>
<LD>   HNC, based in San Diego, develops software that predicts patterns
of human behavior from databases that track transaction histories.</LD>
<LD>   Some of its major customers include financial institutions such as
JP Morgan Chase, telephone companies including AT&amp;T Corp. and
retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.</LD>
<TE>   In an all-share transaction, Fair Isaac is paying about $706
million for HNC, based on the current price of its shares on the New
York Stock Exchange where it closed down 10.3% at $57.50. HNC's
shares finished up $2.08, or nearly 12%, at $19.52 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   HNC and Fair Isaac share some major customers, although catering
to different parts of their clients' businesses.</TE>
<TE>   But the overlap would help Fair Isaac to save annual costs of
about $35 million, its chief executive, Tom Grudnowski, said.</TE>

<HD>States' Qwest Probe Pushes Shares to New Low</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN KLAYMAN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Qwest Communications International Inc. fell to an all-time
low Monday after the voice and data services company said it was
being investigated by several states for alleged anti-competitive
deals with rivals.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest, already under investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, saw its shares close off 79 cents, or 14%, to $4.96 on
the New York Stock Exchange, due in part to fears its entry into
long-distance service in its territory could be delayed.</LD>
<LD>   The dominant local phone company in 14 states from Minnesota to
Washington, Qwest is being investigated by officials in several
states for allegedly cutting secret deals with rivals who agreed not
to oppose the firm's efforts to expand its long-distance business.</LD>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal cited unnamed officials and Qwest rivals
as saying the deals, purportedly giving favored carriers better terms
for the use of parts of Qwest's local-phone network, suggested the
company tried to buy the silence of rivals on the issue of what
access local phone providers have to give competitors.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is not about Qwest failing to allow competition, but
whether the company should have notified the respective state public
utility commissions about the deals, according to Steve Davis, Qwest
senior vice president of policy and law.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest, like other telecom firms seeking to offer both local and
long-distance service, is required to demonstrate to state and
federal regulators that its local networks are open to rivals and
available on equal terms before it can offer the service in its home
territory.</TE>
<TE>   The Baby Bells have been pushing to enter long-distance markets,
but have been criticized for not allowing an even playing field.</TE>
<TE>   The states' investigations, by Minnesota, Arizona, Oregon, New
Mexico and Utah, come at a difficult time for Qwest because it
already faces the SEC probe over its 2000 and 2001 revenue. What's
more, the firm's heavy debt load amid a faltering telecom market has
spooked investors.</TE>
<TE>   "There is probably a likelihood the state probes could delay their
long-distance entry in their region," said Tim Ghriskey, with money
management firm Ghriskey Capital Partners. "That sets back their
recovery efforts."</TE>

<HD>Zell Tries to Reassure Equity Investors</HD>
<DH>Chairman who built his reputation acquiring properties says
his first priority is to insulate the company from further declines
in its markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT BURGESS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chicago billionaire Sam Zell built a fortune acquiring properties
from financially distressed sellers and turning them around. Now, the
self-described "grave dancer" is in a tough spot of his own.</LD>
<LD>   His Equity Office Properties Trust is the worst performer in the
21-member Bloomberg Office REIT Index this year. A dollar invested in
the largest office building owner at the start of the year has shrunk
4.1%, while the index has returned 3.7%.</LD>
<LD>   The lagging performance follows an $11.8-billion West Coast
expansion in 2000 and 2001, as the office-property market was
peaking. Equity Office has since lost a key tenant at its largest
development, Zell's chief executive quit this month and the chief
financial officer's spot has gone unfilled for six months.</LD>
<TE>   Zell, the company's 60-year-old chairman, hosted a conference call
Monday to discuss first-quarter earnings and tried to reassure
investors he can turn around a bad situation. The priority, he said,
is to insulate the company from further declines in its markets and
hire a chief executive whose skills lie more in managing businesses
than acquiring property.</TE>
<TE>   "To his credit, Zell clearly laid out the company's objectives,
but those objectives are formidable hurdles," said Joe Smith, who
helps manage more than $1 billion, including shares of Equity Office,
at Clarion CRA Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Equity Office's shares fell 4 cents to $28.38 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The company's funds from operations--a measure of cash flow used
by REITs, real estate investment trusts--rose to $410.6 million, or
87 cents a share, from $272.6million, or 78 cents, a year earlier.
But the latest results include a fee of $40million, or 8 cents a
share, paid by Sun Microsystems Inc. for not moving into a building
at Equity Office's $223-million Foundry Square project in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "I was out there on the West Coast this month, and what I saw was
worse than I expected," said James Sullivan, a REIT analyst at
Prudential Financial who cut his rating on Equity Office this month
to "hold" from "buy." "High-tech markets appear to be facing a
protracted period of high vacancy."</TE>
<TE>   Zell has a lot at stake. He controls 4.5% of Equity Office, a
holding valued at about $378 million. Although he draws no salary,
his stake collects about $26.5 million a year in dividends.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Equity Office owns 768 buildings across the U.S.,
including New York's Worldwide Plaza, the tower that houses Chicago's
Mercantile Exchange, and Cal Plaza in Los Angeles. It owns more than
125 million square feet of office space, more than twice as much as
its nearest competitor, Toronto-based TrizecHahn Corp., whose
stockholders this month approved its conversion to a U.S.-based REIT.</TE>
<TE>   Zell built his reputation buying real estate in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, when foreclosures were rising. The bet turned out right
when the real estate market recovered faster than expected.</TE>
<TE>   The executive, who leads a group of friends who refer to
themselves as "Zell's Angels" on motorcycle junkets around the world,
strayed from his bottom-fishing investment style last year. Equity
Office bought developer Ned Spieker's Menlo Park, Calif.-based
Spieker Properties for $7.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase, about a year after Zell paid $4.6 billion for
another REIT with a West Coast focus, Cornerstone Properties Inc.,
came when vacancy rates were at all-time lows of less than 3% in such
places as San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Since the purchase, vacancy rates in San Francisco, Boston, San
Jose and Seattle, which account for 45% of Equity Office's net
operating income, have risen to more than 14%, and rents are down
more than 20%, according to Torto Wheaton Research, a real-estate
research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Making Zell's job tougher is the resignation April 19 of Timothy
Callahan, who had been president and chief executive of Equity Office
since it went public in 1997. The company has been searching for a
chief financial officer for six months after promoting Richard
Kincaid to chief operating officer. A chief executive may be named by
November, Zell said Monday.</TE>

<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Price of NeoTherapeutics falls with
lackluster tests of Alzheimer's medication.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NeoTherapeutics Inc. shares fell 64% as the company said its most
advanced experimental product, the Neotrofin medication for
Alzheimer's disease, didn't work as expected in human testing.</LD>
<LD>   The Irvine company's stock fell $1.40 to 80 cents on Nasdaq.
Before Monday, the shares had fallen 40% this year.</LD>
<LD>   Patients on Neotrofin didn't show a statistically significant
benefit compared with those given a placebo treatment in a 12-week
study. NeoTherapeutics said it is suspending Neotrofin research in
Alzheimer's disease, which will reduce its monthly loss to less than
$1.5 million from $2.3 mil- lion.</LD>
<TE>   "We're in no cash crisis right now," said Alvin Glasky, the
company's chief executive. "We're not concerned about the cash
position of the company."</TE>
<TE>   NeoTherapeutics ended 2001 with $7.2 million in cash and
short-term investments. It raised $6.2 million in the first quarter
through a sale of common shares.</TE>
<TE>   Some jobs could be cut because of the halt in Neotrofin testing in
Alzheimer's disease, though massive layoffs are not expected, Glasky
said.</TE>
<TE>   The company is awaiting results of other studies of the drug in
Parkinson's disease, spinal-cord injury and chemotherapy-induced
neuropathy.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier studies suggested that Neotrofin could spur growth of
nerve cells to replace ones destroyed in Alzheimer's disease. The
National Institutes of Health had helped NeoTherapeutics with some
early research needed to move Neotrofin into human testing, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   The drug is based on the action of neurotrophins, molecules the
body makes to promote growth of some brain nerve cells.</TE>
<TE>   NeoTherapeutics said it also is preparing to move a cancer drug,
Satraplatin, into the third and final stage of testing.</TE>

<KH>BEHIND THE WHEEL</KH>
<HD>Honk if You Love Answers to Your Questions</HD>
<DH>Readers have plenty of quibbles and queries about driving
in California. And now, there's a forum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the last decade, California has added more than 800 miles of
carpool lanes to the state's freeway system. And yet carpooling has
declined in the Golden State and across the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Ray Laforteza, a carpooler from Los Angeles, thinks he knows one
reason why the so-called diamond lanes have lost their luster. He
wrote to ask what he should do about maniac drivers who roar up
behind him in the carpool lane and force him to exceed the speed
limit.</LD>
<LD>   Today, to launch a new monthly feature, Behind the Wheel will
tackle questions from readers such as Laforteza. On the last Tuesday
of each month, BTW will field queries, quibbles and questions about
the state of roads and driving in California.</LD>
<TE>   Question: When drivers are following too closely while you are in
the carpool lane and they flash their lights, honk their horn or try
to drive around you, is this right? I don't think I have to squeeze
myself into the slow lane just to let these crazy drivers pass
because they want to drive 100 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: It may seem that people who carpool--thus saving gas and
helping to reduce smog--are gentle, environmentally conscious folks.
You know the sort--wearing hemp-knitted scarves and driving
subcompact cars the size of a major kitchen appliance. Not so. When
it comes to maneuvering Southern California's congested freeways,
carpoolers can be as obnoxious and lead-footed as the rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   The behavior Ray describes is illegal. Speeding, following too
close and improper use of the horn are all violations of the state
vehicle code.</TE>
<TE>   In a perfect world, a vigilant Highway Patrol officer would appear
out of nowhere, arrest such miscreants on the spot and, say, force
them to listen to 12 straight hours of Britney Spears. Serious
violations call for serious penalties.</TE>
<TE>   For you, the law-abiding carpooler, the best response is to remain
under the speed limit and stay in the carpool lane until you can
legally pull over and let the road hog pass.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Connor MacIvor, a 12-year veteran of the Los Angeles
Police Department, also advises that you not try to mete out freeway
justice by slamming on your brakes or flashing a rude gesture. After
all, you don't know who is in the car behind you.</TE>
<TE>   Even MacIvor, a barrel-chested, 6-foot-2-inch motorcycle officer
with a distinctive shaved head, cautioned: "My Lord, I carry a .45
[handgun] wherever I go, but I would back down."</TE>
<TE>   Another target of disdain on Southern California freeways are the
"looky-loos." That's a gentle euphemism for the knuckleheads who
bring freeway traffic to a crawl so they can ogle minor
fender-benders. It's another violation that merits the Britney Spears
sanction, with perhaps a little Celine Dion thrown in for good
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Heather Wall of Irvine wrote to Behind the Wheel with this
suggestion for keeping traffic moving when there is an accident.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why can't the CHP or Caltrans develop a quickly inflatable wall
that could block the view of an accident from oncoming traffic?</TE>
<TE>   A: Interesting idea. Knowing Caltrans, they might try to sell
advertising on these inflated walls. Imagine this: "Burger King:
Official sponsor of your San Diego Freeway accident barricades. Get
off the 405 and grab a 99-cent Gridlock Grill Sandwich, with fries!"
That alone should be reason enough to deflate the inflatable wall
idea.</TE>
<TE>   CHP Sgt. Tim Maley, a 25-year veteran who gave up a promising
career as a comedian to become a cop, got a chuckle out of Heather's
idea.</TE>
<TE>   "Inflatable wall," he said. "That's a good one." Maley raised a
few logistical questions: How many inflatable walls would be needed
to serve the state's massive freeway system? And who would be
responsible for lugging them up and down the freeways?</TE>
<TE>   Heather's frustration is understandable. As it is, research shows
we Southern Californians spend more time in traffic than we do on
vacation. We don't need a bunch of rubber-neckers adding to the
gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, there is not much anyone can do about such
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Maley and his colleagues at the CHP already have their hands full
with road rage, police pursuits and crazed carpoolers. They don't
have time to worry about some slack-jawed commuter who slows down
every time a fellow driver stops to jump-start a Yugo.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of stupidity on the road, Rich Keegan of Torrance
wondered if there is any rational thinking behind the names of some
of the state's freeways. He wrote with this question:</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why are some freeways that are identified as "interstate," in
fact, only in California? Highways like the I-405, I-105 and I-110,
and a slew of others in San Francisco, go only relatively short
distances--all within California.</TE>
<TE>   A: Rich raises a good point.</TE>
<TE>   While we're at it, why is the 405 called the San Diego Freeway
when, in fact, it extends south to Irvine, not San Diego?</TE>
<TE>   And what about the 170 in the San Fernando Valley? It is called
the Hollywood Freeway, but it merges with the 101 freeway about five
miles short of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   First, let's deal with Rich's question.</TE>
<TE>   He points out correctly that some "interstate" freeways do not
extend between two states. Still, the freeways earn the "interstate"
title because they serve as alternate routes to interstate freeways
that do join two or more states.</TE>
<TE>   In the freeway system, there is an advantage to being dubbed an
"interstate"--the federal government pays 90% of the construction
cost, considerably more than it will pony up for a lowly state
freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Interstate 405 is considered an alternate to Interstate 5.
Interstate 210 is an alternate to Interstate 10. The I-110 and the
I-710 are not really alternates to any legitimate interstate freeway,
but lawmakers in Washington granted them exemptions because the
freeways serve the interstate transportation of goods from the ports
of Los Angeles and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "They kind of stretched the definition on those," said Chuck
O'Connell, a former Caltrans deputy district director who has 40
years of experience building and managing freeways.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Hollywood and the San Diego freeways, O'Connell said
those names were adopted back in the days when motorists on those
freeways were primarily destined for Hollywood and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, the good old days: When carpooling was safer than skydiving.
When drivers weren't so frustrated they dreamed of inflatable walls.
And when an interstate did not take you from the state of disbelief
to the state of despair.</TE>

<HD>A Hollywood League of Their Own</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Women run the top guilds. But female actors
and directors still struggle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just days before Halle Berry snagged her historic Oscar, another
Hollywood barrier fell, quietly, with less fanfare, but engendering
the same sense of disbelief that it had taken so long: A woman,
Martha Coolidge, was named president of the Directors Guild of
America.</LD>
<LD>   She's not alone at the top of the heap. In a coincidental
convergence never before seen in Hollywood, women are running the
town's other major guilds as well.</LD>
<LD>   In March, Coolidge joined Vicki Riskin, the first female president
of the Writers Guild of America, West, and Melissa Gilbert, the third
woman to serve as president of the Screen Actors Guild.</LD>
<TE>   Together, they represent 12,000 directors, 8,500 writers, 98,000
actors--the majority of Hollywood's talent pool.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, in a grand scale, it clearly means that women are
playing in what has traditionally been a boys' club up to now," said
Gilbert, a former star of "Little House on the Prairie." "It's
exciting to be a part of this, but I look forward to the day when
it's not even a qualification."</TE>
<TE>   Whether there is more to it than the curiosity factor is a matter
of some debate in Hollywood, where dismal statistics persist on the
treatment and hiring of female writers, directors and actors. For
example, according to DGA records, female film directors are working
less and less. Certainly, the guild presidents find themselves at the
helm during a time of tumult and contradictions--one in which female
executives, including studio heads such as Stacey Snider, Sherry
Lansing and Amy Pascal, are relatively prominent and plentiful, but
female talent still struggles. Moreover, the unions now must square
off against negotiating opponents that are not simply studios or
networks but vast multinational corporations with deep resources,
conglomerates that many in the creative community already fear are
attempting to erode artistic freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   For many in town, the mere discussion of the gender of guild
presidents brings about groans. It seems about as relevant as the
onetime feminist flash point "Ally McBeal," which is going off the
air.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be past it. Do you know how many trillions of times
I've been asked, 'As a woman, what was it like ... ?'" said
Oscar-winning writer-director Callie Khouri, a WGA board member. "And
my answer always is, 'As opposed to what? Reality?'"</TE>
<TE>   Yet she noted: "It's shameful how few women and blacks are working
in Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the talent guilds have been among the most
influential unions in town because a strike can have serious economic
consequences.  "They have a bully pulpit," Alan Brunswick, a labor
lawyer, said of the guild presidents. "Any one of them can get a
meeting with any of the studio heads at any time because of their
position."</TE>
<TE>   Having women in such positions, said Meryl Poster, co-president of
Miramax Films, "is a sign of the progress we've made, but there is
still plenty of room for more."</TE>
<TE>   The three guild heads are not planning any collective efforts to
improve diversity and have not yet met to discuss business. Coolidge
described her task as to "pressure, embarrass, prepare and educate
our members and the employers."</TE>
<TE>   "We can't tell people who to hire and how to hire them, but we can
certainly commend or admonish them for what they do or don't do,"
said Gilbert, whose union has been mired in internal strife for two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Riskin and Gilbert won their posts in open elections, while
Coolidge, formerly the DGA's first vice president, was named by the
board to replace Jack Shea when he retired. All the positions are
unpaid.</TE>
<TE>   The three are part of a veritable bumper crop of female guild
presidents in power in Hollywood today, including Kathleen Kennedy at
the Producers Guild of America and Lisa Zeno Churgin at the Motion
Picture Editors Guild. They join a plethora of women in the executive
ranks, ranging from the three female studio chairs to the four
women--Susan Lyne, Nancy Tellem, Gail Berman and Dawn
Tarnofksy-Ostroff--who run the entertainment divisions at ABC, CBS,
Fox and UPN. The visibility, prestige and presumable influence of
these women obscure the fact that employment levels for most creative
women have barely budged in the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   "People tend to look at women who are so high-profile and think
women must be equally represented in the workplace. We know that's
not the case," said Martha Lauzen, professor of communications at San
Diego State University, who studies the employment of women in
Hollywood. "If you look at the number of women working behind the
scenes, they're dramatically underrepresented."</TE>
<TE>   In the latest DGA statistics, for the year ending April 2002,
women directed nine of the 145 studio films released, accounting for
6.2% of the whole. In January, the DGA released a report on the top
40 prime-time shows of the 2000-01 TV season, showing that women
directed 11% of the episodes, and none on high-profile shows like
"Friends."</TE>
<TE>   Female writers are slightly better off. Still, according to
Riskin, only a quarter of the WGA's membership is female, suggesting
it is difficult for women to land the first job. And in 1999-2000,
about half of the guild's female writers were employed. In a study of
the top-grossing 250 films of 2000, conducted by Lauzen, women
accounted for 14% of credited writers.</TE>
<TE>   According to the writers guild, the percentage of women working on
prime-time TV in the 2001 season increased slightly, to 28%, after
years of stagnating between 22% and 24%.</TE>
<TE>   And that can affect what's on the screen. "On prime-time TV, when
you have at least one woman in a position of power, not only do you
get more female characters on screen, but you get a different kind of
female, one that tends to be more powerful," Lauzen said.</TE>
<TE>   Actors are another matter. In 2000, women claimed 38% of the SAG
roles, but they all but disappeared from the screen after 40.</TE>
<TE>   The dearth of women in a business in which almost everybody pays
lip service to the idea of meritocracy defies easy explanation,
though one top film executive said that sexism plays a significant
role: "Of course, it does. What else could it be?"</TE>
<TE>   Others cited the film industry's obsession with the young male
demographic and the high-octane action-adventure pieces that have
ruled Hollywood for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "These are all multinational corporations with bottom lines, and
the bottom-line movies are action-driven pictures," said Hollace
Davids, president of Women in Film, Hollywood's leading professional
women's association. "You don't tend to see women directing 'The
Mummy' or 'Spider-Man.'"</TE>
<TE>   Although Hollywood has increasingly recognized the power of female
audiences, that hasn't translated into more women behind the scenes.
This spring has brought a glut of female-driven thrillers such as
"Panic Room," "High Crimes," "Murder by Numbers" and the upcoming
"Unfaithful," but none was directed by a woman, and only one claims a
credited female co-writer.</TE>
<TE>   "There is often very little time that can be devoted to searching
out candidates for various jobs," said Kennedy, the president of the
producers guild. "The speed at which decisions are made often
requires people to rely on word of mouth rather than resumes ...
giving the appearance of a closed-door environment."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of diversity in the entertainment business is a topic
that few in the executive ranks are keen to discuss openly. Those
willing to speak publicly felt confident about their track records.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a disproportionately [high] statistic at this studio,"
said Amy Pascal, chairman of Columbia Pictures, who has nurtured the
careers of such talent as Susannah Grant, Penny Marshall and Betty
Thomas. "I don't believe that men can only do a certain kind of movie
or that women can do a certain kind of movie."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm actually surprised that those percentages don't look any
better," said Toby Emmerich, New Line's president of production. "I
don't think that I've ever heard anybody say that they would favor a
writer or director because of gender."</TE>
<TE>   However, he does note that certain genre considerations influence
which directors are hired. "On chick flicks, like 'The First Wives
Club,' you tend to think, 'Let's get a woman director.' And I suppose
there's a kind of big testosterone action picture where you tend to
hire 'shooters,' and the 'shooters' tend to be men that come from the
worlds of video and commercials and tough, cool stuff. Outside of
those genres, I've never paid attention to whether the person is a
man or a woman."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, cited the long
roster of women working in the executive ranks at the network. "The
boys' club that may have existed before is disappearing," he said.
"It's something that clearly should have happened many years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Sassa, NBC West Coast president, said the opportunities, and
statistics, are better for women in TV, where there are 100 shows a
year, each with 24 episodes.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the top sitcom directors for us are women. Right now you
have a critical mass of women who have gone through the ranks and are
ready to take the top jobs in directing and writing," he said. "We've
been working with the guilds on diversity, and that helps."</TE>
<TE>   Some suggested that women's lifestyle choices might be one factor
depressing their employment levels. "If you want to direct a film,
that's a year of your life that's gone," said writer Diane English,
best known for creating TV's "Murphy Brown." "Society makes that a
tougher choice for women than it does for men."</TE>
<TE>   The three talent guild presidents are careful to note that
although women's issues are important to them, they're not the only
ones on an agenda packed with such pressing realities as runaway
production. "I'm here to serve the entire membership, not just the
women," Riskin said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are those great new networking opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   As Coolidge said, "You can now have the three presidents of the
guilds bumping into each other in the ladies' room rather than the
men's room."</TE>

<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>Responding to criticism that human rights groups ignore Israeli
victims, on Monday the head of Amnesty International visited Israelis
hurt in Palestinian terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout 19 months of battles, Israeli officials have complained
that international human rights groups have not condemned suicide
bombings and shooting attacks, which many Palestinians support in
their struggle for an independent homeland.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no excuse for human rights abuse, whether in the name of
security or in the name of liberation," Irene Khan, Amnesty's
secretary-general, said Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Khan said the Palestinian Authority and armed Palestinian groups
have a responsibility under international law to protect the rights
of civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Khan, who also toured the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank,
came to a Tel Aviv hospital Monday and talked with two Israelis
recovering from Palestinian attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Aviad Ohayon, 18, remembered pleading with a tall gunman, just a
year older than Ohayon, who cut through the fence of the Jewish
settlement of Atzmona in the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "We said to him that we were just students, we don't have a
weapon," he said from the hospital nearly two months after the
attack. The gunman shot into a crowd of teens studying religious
texts, killing five of Ohayon's classmates.</TE>

<HD>One Crisis Down, Tougher Ones to Come</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Arafat's release would be a first step in bringing
peace to region. The parties differ on what lies ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Three weeks after his tough words on the Middle East failed to
produce progress, President Bush got tougher over the
weekend--personally intervening with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to
end the bloody standoffs between Israel and the Palestinians. A deal
to lift the siege on Ramallah is done, and U.S. officials say another
on Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity appears near.</LD>
<LD>   But solving these crises is likely to be easy compared with what
lies ahead, U.S., Arab and Israeli officials warn.</LD>
<LD>   As details are worked out on freeing Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat from his besieged headquarters, the Bush
administration is scrambling behind the scenes on how to convert the
new opening into long-term gains toward peace in the Middle East. But
serious gaps have already emerged on what step should come next.</LD>
<TE>   The Arab world, led by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, is pressing
hard, once an Israeli pullout from the West Bank is complete, for one
swift, final political deal to settle the half-century-old conflict,
in part to avoid the prolonged stages that may foster more
Palestinian frustration and violence.</TE>
<TE>   But the United States is talking only about accelerating
negotiations and blending the security and political phases of the
peace process. And Israel wants full security arrangements in place
before it begins talks on a final political settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Which direction to take must be decided before the parties even
get to the substantive matters--over which there are far deeper
differences. So U.S. officials are cautioning against high
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing in the Middle East is easy," White House Press Secretary
Ari Fleischer said Monday. "Nothing stays as hopeful as you'd like it
to be for long."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "The president is pleased with the action over the
weekend and pleased with the initial follow-through, but it's going
to have to be closely monitored."</TE>
<TE>   The complexity of working out the deal over Arafat's departure
from his headquarters in Ramallah underscores the enormousness of
what lies ahead.</TE>
<TE>   A confluence of factors finally persuaded Bush to use diplomatic
elbow grease to end the crisis, which was provoked by the Passover
massacre by a Palestinian suicide bomber that led Israel to invade
the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's actions were precipitated by the visits of Abdullah and
other Arab leaders last week, persistent requests by European allies,
the first signs of Israeli flexibility and recognition at the White
House that nothing would happen on the big issues in either the
Middle East or the war on terrorism until the current crisis was
resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell "had tried to work on this same
arrangement when he was in the region, but the parties weren't ready
then," said a senior administration official who asked to remain
anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   A major snag involved five Palestinians holed up in Arafat's
compound whom Israel wanted to charge with the October assassination
of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi; a sixth man, Arafat's
accountant, is also wanted.</TE>
<TE>   As time passed, the Israeli government recognized that it wasn't
going to be able to conduct its own trial of the six men--and
Washington found room to negotiate, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The timing coincided with the visits last week of the Saudi
leader, Morocco's king and the Lebanese prime minister, all of whom
brought similarly strong messages about the dangers for all involved
if the crisis was not defused. Abdullah was particularly forceful,
U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "In talking to the Saudis, the president committed to doing all he
could," the senior administration official said. "In the end, his
intervention put the process over the edge."</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush's calls to Sharon on Saturday were the critical
turning point, much of the legwork was done in a constant flurry of
calls Thursday through Sunday by Powell and National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice, administration sources say.</TE>
<TE>   Powell worked the phones with the Saudi delegation, still
ensconced in Houston; Jordan's King Abdullah II; Egypt's President
Hosni Mubarak, and others who were dealing with Arafat. He also was
in contact with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. Meanwhile,
Rice kept a virtual open line to Danny Ayalon, Sharon's foreign
policy advisor, on Sunday during the Israeli government's stormy
six-hour Cabinet session.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials deny reports out of Israel that Sharon
won U.S. concessions in exchange for persuading his conservative
coalition Cabinet to embrace ending the Ramallah siege--an idea he
had repeatedly rejected. And they vehemently reject claims that
Washington had agreed to "go soft" on the dispute involving the
United Nations team that wants to investigate claims of a massacre by
Israeli troops at the Jenin refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no quid pro quo. This is the right thing to do. Both
sides benefit," a senior State Department official said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But Powell, as part of his weekend calls, did talk with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan about both Ramallah and the Jenin issue,
a well-placed official confirmed. Last week, Powell had stayed out of
the debate over the makeup of the team, urging Israel and the United
Nations to work out the details. But over the weekend, Powell urged
Annan to accommodate Israel to the extent possible but to stand firm
that the investigation must proceed, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   And now the administration says the standoff at the Church of the
Nativity, where scores of Palestinians have been holed up for a
month, may soon come to an end.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been hoping for a breakthrough over the last several days.
But all the elements are in place," Powell said late Monday. "There
are still some difficult discussions to take place, but I think it
will resolve in the near future."</TE>
<TE>   For all the personal clout Bush invested in this opening round, he
is unlikely to personally intervene in the next rounds--or so the
administration insisted Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is going to be involved when it's necessary and
useful. But don't assume he will negotiate every particular issue or
standoff that comes up. Assume that Bush will act as Bush--not as
[Presidents] Carter or Clinton or Reagan did. He'll intervene only
when necessary. He's repeatedly said he wants his secretary of State
to carry the ball," the senior administration official added.</TE>
<TE>   Just what happens next will be discussed Thursday by the U.S., the
United Nations, the European Union and Russia, a quartet of powers
mobilized by Powell earlier this month in Madrid to sponsor Middle
East peace efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The United States will also remain in close touch with Saudi
Arabia "to work together" on the three basic areas of the peace
process, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The three are security and "freedom from terror" for both sides,
an accelerated negotiating process to provide hope on the political
horizon, and humanitarian aid and economic reconstruction to address
the "desperate situations" among Palestinians, Boucher said.</TE>

<HD>Arafat's Money Man a Focus in Tug of War</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>TRACY WILKINSON and ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Inside Yasser Arafat's wrecked headquarters, the man near the top of
Israel's most wanted list is a pudgy, 62-year-old accountant.</LD>
<LD>   He is Fuad Shubaki, chief financial officer of the Palestinian
Authority.</LD>
<LD>   A longtime colleague of Arafat and one of the Palestinian
Authority president's most trusted aides, Shubaki knows who has paid
how much to whom and when and for what. He has had a hand in
procuring weapons for the Palestinians for years, according to both
Israeli and Palestinian sources. Israelis consider him the crucial
building block in what they hope will become the definitive case to
discredit Arafat.</LD>
<TE>   Even as Israel's monthlong siege of Arafat's Ramallah compound
comes to an end, it is the fate of Shubaki, a high school graduate
with a near-photographic memory for numbers, that is most
problematic, according to diplomats and officials.</TE>
<TE>   Shubaki has been holed up inside the compound with Arafat, other
aides, guards and the now-convicted killers of an Israeli Cabinet
minister.</TE>
<TE>   Shubaki and the killers are destined for a dusty prison in Jericho
under terms of a U.S.-brokered agreement, while Israel continues to
demand the extradition of all six men.</TE>
<TE>   But it is Shubaki whom Israeli officials are most keen to
question--and whom Arafat is most reluctant to give up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like 'The Untouchables,' " one U.S. official said. "How did
they go after Capone? They went after the bookkeeper. . . . In the
Palestinian world, Shubaki is that bookkeeper. That's the role he's
playing. But the goal is not Shubaki, [it's] Arafat."</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not he has anything to hide, Arafat can ill afford to
let the Israelis get their hands on Shubaki and his knowledge of the
financial operations of both the Palestinian Authority and Arafat's
Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli intelligence officials believe that Shubaki has controlled
millions, if not billions, of dollars over the years--money that was
used to equip Palestinian militias, before the founding of the
Palestinian Authority, and security services afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Palestinian Authority was established, Shubaki, as its
chief financial officer, had partial control over the treasury, which
was funded by aboveboard sources such as European, Saudi and Israeli
contributions, plus tax revenue. More intriguing, he may have
intimate knowledge of Arafat's private and extremely well-stocked
bank accounts, intelligence officials say.</TE>
<TE>   They hope Shubaki can provide proof that Arafat financed
terrorism. They say he may be able to supply information on payments
to militant groups such as the Fatah-affiliated Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade, which has carried out numerous shooting and suicide bombing
attacks on Israelis; the structure and membership of it and similar
groups; details of arms deals; and Iranian involvement in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "They want him as the smoking gun to definitely link the head of
the PA, and to some extent the whole structure of the PA, to the
whole structure of terror," said a second U.S. official. "Israel
wants to marry the two and create a seamless link so that they can
eliminate the PA."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli and Palestinian sources agree that Shubaki could do little
without Arafat's permission. Through a lawyer, he has denied
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Shubaki's formal job since the establishment of the Palestinian
Authority in 1994 has been to pay the salaries and buy the
equipment--from guns to boots--for the three most elite and most
powerful of the Palestinians' many security branches: the Preventive
Security Service, the General Intelligence Service and the Force 17
presidential guard. Israel maintains that some members of these
organizations have engaged in attacks against Israelis. Palestinians
do not deny that but say an entire police force cannot be blamed for
the actions of a few.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian sources said Shubaki also controls the purse strings
of Fatah, with oversight of all the money that goes into the
organization and comes out of it. He is a partner in several
businesses, including a yogurt company in the Gaza Strip, that
represent investments of Fatah money, associates said.</TE>
<TE>   And before the Palestinian Authority existed, he performed a
similar function at Arafat's side, disbursing the funds for
Fatah-affiliated militias.</TE>
<TE>   "He's Arafat's pocket," said his lawyer and friend, Hussein
Shyoukhi. "Not more, not less."</TE>
<TE>   Shubaki first came to general public attention after the seizure
in early January of the Karine-A weapons ship. Israeli authorities
intercepted the vessel in the Red Sea and said it contained 50 tons
of sophisticated weaponry destined for the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials at the time said they had evidence that the
shipment came from Iran and was bankrolled by Shubaki. It was
Shubaki's role as the official authorizing payments, Israel argued,
that established the link between the weapons and the Palestinian
Authority and exposed Iranian infiltration into the Palestinian
territories in a bid to stoke the flames of the intifada.</TE>
<TE>   Another U.S. official confirmed that the Bush administration also
believes Shubaki played a key role in the shipment.</TE>
<TE>   "He seemed to have his fingerprints all over the Karine-A
situation," the official said, although he characterized Shubaki as a
"middle fish" instead of a major player who could personally tie
Arafat to recent terrorist attacks against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat denied any connection to the weapons shipment.</TE>
<TE>   When Israeli troops invaded the West Bank city of Ramallah on
March 29 and stormed Arafat's compound, they headed for the offices
of Shubaki and general intelligence director Tawfiq Tirawi. Among
truckloads of documents seized, Israeli intelligence officials say,
were invoices signed by Shubaki issuing shoulder-fired antitank
rocket launchers to the Force 17. There was also evidence of the
acquisition of antiaircraft missiles, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority is allowed to have a large quantity of
small arms, but rocket launchers and antiaircraft missiles are banned
according to treaties.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the chief smuggler," said Israeli army intelligence officer
Col. Miri Eisen, who has been tracking Shubaki.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials have called into question the authenticity
of all of the documents, noting the extrajudicial way in which they
were taken, and accused Israel of fabricating evidence to build its
case against Shubaki, the Palestinian Authority and Arafat. U.S.
authorities said they have not independently confirmed the
credibility of the materials.</TE>
<TE>   Another document provided by Israeli intelligence officials to
reporters was purported to be an invoice submitted by the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade to Shubaki, outlining expenses incurred by the
faction for bomb-making materials, other weaponry and memorial
ceremonies for its suicide bombers. The letter, dated Sept. 16,
requested money for a month's supply of about 30 bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Israel offered no evidence that the money was given, and Eisen
said investigators have not yet been able to establish that Shubaki
made direct payments to Al Aqsa.</TE>
<TE>   Shubaki holds at least two passports, according to Israeli
intelligence officials. Troops who raided his office confiscated a
red Palestinian Authority passport, issued in November 1998, and a
red Yemeni diplomatic passport, issued in June of the same year.</TE>
<TE>   In the Yemeni document, entry and exit stamps show that Shubaki
traveled to Iraq in August and November of last year. Israeli sources
suggest that he may have met with Iraqi arms dealers at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The British press has reported that Shubaki also headed a
delegation to Moscow in September 2001 to sign a $15-million deal
with Iranian arms dealers. Such a trip does not appear in the two
confiscated passports; he may hold yet another passport, or his
passport may not have been stamped upon his entry into Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli intelligence officials provided the passports, along with
other information, to The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Within Fatah and the Palestinian middle management, Shubaki has
been regarded as someone to turn to for money or other needs such as
gasoline, computers and equipment, said Ahmed Nasser, a Gaza-based
veteran Fatah activist who has known Shubaki since the two lived in
exile in Tunisia 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But the bigger acquisitions always required the approval of
Arafat, Nasser said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a very small margin to work in, without a decision from
Abu Amar [Arafat]," Nasser said. "If a section wants a car or two,
fine. But it's not a very big margin."</TE>
<TE>   Shubaki was born in Gaza to an old Gazan family and followed an
older brother into Arafat's Fatah movement in the mid-1960s. He went
into exile with most Fatah activists in 1967, after Israel captured
the Gaza Strip. He wasn't educated beyond high school but had enough
business acumen--it is not clear that much was required--to ease into
the workings of the financial administration of Arafat's regime.</TE>
<TE>   At the least, he had a good head for numbers, associates recall.</TE>
<TE>   "Thousands of papers can cross his desk, and he can remember every
detail, every story," Nasser said. "Who he sends money to, where, how
much. He is very careful."</TE>
<TE>   Shubaki normally wears a military uniform and holds the rank of
colonel, but it is honorary and he has never been a fighter, his
associates say.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a soldier, he's an accountant," Shyoukhi, the lawyer,
said.</TE>
<TE>   As one of Arafat's closest confidants, Shubaki was with him in
Jordan in the 1970s, under siege in Beirut in 1982 and in exile in
Tunisia. He followed Arafat back to Gaza by a few months, returning
in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has lived in Gaza City with his wife and five
children. After the Karine-A scandal, Arafat, under enormous U.S.
pressure, agreed to arrest Shubaki, ordering him into a special cell
inside the Ramallah compound. Israelis did not take the arrest
seriously, but it does explain why Shubaki was at the compound when
the army struck.</TE>
<TE>   Shubaki denies involvement with Iranian arms brokers and the
Karine-A deal, Shyoukhi said. The lawyer visited Shubaki twice in
jail before the Israelis took over the compound. He said Shubaki
continued to profess his innocence and looked tired. Their last
telephone conversation was March 27.</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Cut Off Talks on Siege</HD>
<DH>Bethlehem: Move comes after Israeli fire kills another
alleged gunman in the Church of the Nativity. But in the U.S., Powell
says he expects an agreement soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Palestinian negotiators broke off talks over the siege at the Church
of the Nativity on Monday after Israeli forces killed another alleged
gunman holed up inside one of Christianity's holiest sites.</LD>
<LD>   The interruption undermined hopes for a quick resolution of the
standoff at the location revered as Jesus' birthplace. Disputes also
broke out among Palestinians trapped inside the church.</LD>
<LD>   "We cannot continue negotiating under these circumstances," said
Bethlehem Mayor Hanna Nasser, a member of the Palestinian negotiating
committee. "We are stuck in the mud. Nothing is moving."</LD>
<TE>   But later Monday, a Palestinian negotiator said he expected talks
to resume today. And in Washington, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell said he expected an agreement to end the stalemate would be
reached soon.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis would not comment on the status of the negotiations
but acknowledged that scheduled meetings did not take place Monday.</TE>
<TE>   They also confirmed that Israeli forces had shot and killed a
Palestinian on Monday morning who they said was firing an automatic
weapon from inside the church. Palestinians identified the man as
Nidal Abeiyat.</TE>
<TE>   "If we continue with negotiations, this is as if we are giving
them the chance to continue with their killings of more
Palestinians," chief Palestinian negotiator Salah Tamari told the Al
Jazeera satellite television network. "If the Israeli side is serious
in achieving a nonviolent solution to the situation, it should stop
shooting against the church."</TE>
<TE>   The siege is entering its fourth week. An estimated 180
Palestinian men remain inside the basilica, their supplies of water,
food and electricity severely limited.</TE>
<TE>   They are accompanied by about 40 clerics from different Christian
denominations, who jointly operate the church. The religious compound
has been under siege since shortly after the Israelis began their
West Bank offensive late last month to root out terrorist cells.</TE>
<TE>   The standoff is also disrupting Easter week celebrations at the
church for the Greek Orthodox community, which has a different
liturgical calendar than the Roman Catholic and Protestant faiths and
marks Easter this Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The key problem remains the fate of about 10 Palestinian men
wanted by the Israelis for attacks against soldiers and civilians.
The Israelis say the men are militants from the Islamic group Hamas
and from the Tanzim, the military wing of Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis insist that the men face trial in Israel or exile abroad.
But the Palestinians say the men should be sent to the Gaza Strip for
Palestinian judicial proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Neither side has budged during six days of talks, a period in
which the Israelis have wounded two men inside the church and killed
two others, including the man shot Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians now want the Israelis to accept a solution
similar to the one to end Arafat's confinement at his compound in
Ramallah. They issued a call on Monday for increased diplomatic
efforts to persuade the Israelis to allow a Palestinian trial for the
wanted men that would be monitored by U.S. or British
representatives.</TE>
<TE>   As the two sides canceled their talks, cracks began to show in the
united front that the Palestinians inside the church have maintained.</TE>
<TE>   An unidentified group of men called a local television station
from inside the church Sunday to deny that the Palestinian
negotiation team represented their interests. They said they would
not abide by any agreement reached by the team.</TE>
<TE>   Also, leaflets began circulating in the streets of nearby Beit
Jala proclaiming that the Palestinian team was selling out the
interests of militants inside the church.</TE>
<TE>   At least 28 Palestinians inside the church signed a document
Monday agreeing to accept exile. Most who signed, according to
sources close to the negotiators, are Tanzim members who have
requested deportations to places such as London, Paris and the
Mediterranean island of Cyprus.</TE>
<TE>   But Nasser said that Arafat had explicitly ruled out any such
deportation. Instead, he said the Palestinian leader insisted that
the men be taken to Gaza for trial.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not up to those inside the church to decide where to go,"
Nasser said. "It's a very dangerous precedent, and we can't afford
it."</TE>
<TE>   The food supply is another important issue. Israeli soldiers
stopped a protest group from delivering bags of food on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Men could be seen scurrying from the church Monday to collect some
of the abandoned bags of food. A wire was also seen poking from the
front door of the church in an apparent attempt to drag in discarded
cookies and crackers.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army offered Monday to deliver 50 individual meals to
the church, telling a Palestinian official that those not receiving
the food could leave the church, Nasser said. But the Palestinians
turned down the offer, saying everyone inside the church should be
supplied food at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   People who have recently left the church said that water is being
drawn from insect-infested cisterns and that meals have dwindled to
grass that those inside the compound have been able to harvest.</TE>

<LD>North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has invited former President Bill
Clinton to visit Pyongyang to play a mediating role and to cool
rhetoric from Washington, a North Korean official said.</LD>
<LD>   The official declined to specify whether Kim issued the invitation
before or after President Bush's January speech in which he branded
North Korea as part of an "axis of evil."</LD>
<LD>   "The plan of the Dear Leader Kim Jong Il is that Mr. Clinton
should end the rhetoric," the official said.</LD>
<TE>   In New York, Clinton spokeswoman Julia Payne said the former
president had not received any such invitation.</TE>

<LD>Europe's leading human rights court threw out an appeal by a
terminally ill and paralyzed British woman who wants her husband to
help end her life.</LD>
<LD>   "The law has taken all my rights away," said Diane Pretty,
speaking in London with the aid of a keyboard and a voice synthesizer
after the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg,
France.</LD>
<LD>   Pretty, 43, suffers from a motor neuron disease that has left her

<LD>Britain has decided to treat any Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters it
might capture in Afghanistan as prisoners of war and turn them over
to the interim Afghan government.</LD>
<LD>   British representatives said they lack sufficient ground forces to
conduct legal hearings about the appropriate status of individual
prisoners. So far, the British have no captives in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The British decision further isolates the U.S. in its policy of
classifying detainees as "unlawful combatants" rather than as
prisoners of war. Under the U.S. policy, hundreds of prisoners are in
indefinite detention without charge and some may be tried by special
military tribunals.</LD>

<HD>Watching the Time Slip Away</HD>
<DH>Koreans despairing of reuniting with family across the DMZ
are dying, some by suicide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GOYANG, South Korea</DL>
<LD>Chung In Kook, 82, woke before sunrise and slipped out of the house.
He didn't say goodbye to his wife. He took a taxi heading north, and
when it couldn't go any farther, he got out and walked the rest of
the way to an observatory at the edge of the DMZ.</LD>
<LD>   Then he jumped.</LD>
<LD>   When the body was examined, police quickly discovered the reason
for the suicide: A slip of paper folded into his wallet identified
Chung as Applicant No. 4040 for a government-sponsored reunion for
South Koreans to meet family members in North Korea. Just days
earlier, Chung had learned that, for the fourth time, he wasn't among
those lucky few selected by computer to participate in the latest
round of reunions.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no hope. At this pace, I'll never be picked," he told
his wife shortly before he killed himself in the demilitarized zone,
which was as close as he could get to the North.</TE>
<TE>   This week, nearly 900 Koreans from both sides of the divided
peninsula are meeting family members they haven't seen for more than
half a century. The fourth such reunion since 2000, this, like the
others, is proving to be a tremendously emotional occasion. Many
tears are being spilled.</TE>
<TE>   But those tears are literally drops in the bucket, given that up
to 10 million Koreans--one-seventh of the population of the
peninsula--have relatives on the opposite side whom they are unlikely
to see before they die. It is a classic case of too little, too late,
especially for the elderly and infirm, who see their chances waning
with each passing year.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics released recently by the South Korean government showed
that 12.4% of the 117,576 applicants on a waiting list for reunions
had died.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the euphoria that followed the historic visit of South
Korean President Kim Dae Jung to Pyongyang, the North's capital,
nearly two years ago, there have been fewer reunions than
anticipated, largely because the North Koreans have balked. The
fourth round was supposed to take place in mid-October but was
abruptly canceled by the North, which objected to a state of alert
imposed in South Korea after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "At the current rate, we will be lucky if one out of 10,000 people
gets to see their relatives," said Min Byung Dai, the director of
South-North relations for the South Korean Red Cross in Seoul. "It is
like a lottery. The chances of being picked in any given round are
very small, but people keep on trying for any chance they can get."</TE>
<TE>   In the turbulent period after the end of World War II, when Korea
was partitioned between Soviet and U.S.-administered sectors,
millions of Koreans fled their homes to align themselves with one
side or the other.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Family Left Son Behind in 1945</TE>
<TE>   Chung In Kook, a 25-year-old civil servant at the time, left his
home in Shinchon, North Korea, in the dark of night in 1945 to escape
the Communists. His wife followed him shortly afterward, carrying
their infant son strapped to her back, but the couple's 5-year-old
boy was left behind with his paternal grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   "[The grandparents] wouldn't let the boy go. They said they loved
him too much, that it would be too hard for him to make the trip. So
I let him stay," Lim Young Seon, Chung's 78-year-old widow, recalled
as she sat under an arbor of lilacs and ivy at the family's home.</TE>
<TE>   In South Korea, the family prospered and grew. The couple had four
more children--three boys and a girl. Chung quickly found work as a
police officer and in later years turned to a more lucrative career
as a real estate broker.</TE>
<TE>   But as he aged, Chung grew increasingly melancholy about his
family left behind in North Korea. While his wife fretted about their
first-born son--they couldn't even find out if he had survived the
Korean War--Chung missed his parents and became consumed with guilt
about neglecting his filial duty to care for them in their old age.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a sinner. I deserted my parents," Chung used to say, his
wife recalled.</TE>
<TE>   At Chung's insistence, the couple moved in 1996 from Seoul to
Goyang, a pretty suburb nestled in the hills to the north and known
for its abundance of flower nurseries. The attraction for Chung,
however, was its proximity to the North Korean border. From here,
it's only 80 miles to his hometown of Shinchon--in any normal country
an easy day trip, but in Korea so unthinkable that Shinchon might as
well be in another galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   To console himself, Chung went regularly to a small observatory
built next to a bridge over the Imjin River, which runs down from
North Korea and wends its way through the DMZ. The northernmost reach
of South Korea, it is a popular spot for tourists, who can catch
glimpses through the barbed wire of the forbidden country still
farther north, and for separated family members, who come, especially
on holidays, with offerings of food for traditional Confucian rituals
honoring their ancestors.</TE>
<TE>   Chung had been there with his wife and children just four days
before his death to mark Chusok, the Korean version of Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the visitors are very old and are brought, sometimes in
wheelchairs, by their sons and daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "People sometimes get so choked up by emotion that they faint.
They have to be taken away by ambulance.... There are old people too
who come every day. When somebody stops coming, we know it is because
they have died," said Kim Kook Hyon, who manages the observatory.</TE>
<TE>   It was Kim who discovered Chung's body on the morning of Oct. 5.
He wasn't entirely shocked. Just a few months before, he had ordered
netting strung under the bridge in case a distraught visitor ever
tried to jump. Chung, however, maneuvered his 82-year-old body over
the netting and positioned himself so he would fall not in the river,
but on a concrete abutment. He hit his head on the concrete and was
killed instantly.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the act of one determined man," Kim said. "He wanted to
kill himself and knew exactly what he was doing."</TE>
<TE>   The separated Koreas are like no other place in the world, with
communication between the two defying the most advanced technical
capabilities of a wired society. No telephone calls or e-mails are
possible. Unlike separated Germans during the days of the Berlin
Wall, Koreans are unable even to send letters or exchange messages
via the Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unique. There is no place like this in the world where
people spent half a century so thoroughly separated that they don't
know whether their family on the other side are alive or dead," said
Min of the South Korean Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reunions Come Too Late for Some</TE>
<TE>   Since the June 2000 summit in Pyongyang, there had been until now
three government-sponsored reunions, each involving 100 people from
each side selected to meet their relatives. In the South,
participants are chosen solely by computer lottery, with some
preference given to people over 90 years old and to parents separated
from their sons and daughters. They then travel to the other side and
meet anywhere from two to 10 relatives. (Therefore, although the
number of "winners" is small, a far larger number of Koreans can
participate if their names are among those submitted by the winners
as the loved ones with whom they wish to reunite.)</TE>
<TE>   It is enormously frustrating for those not selected and who are
reduced to watching on television. On Saturday night, hours before
this week's reunions were to begin, the body of a 77-year-old man was
discovered in his apartment in Chuncheon, South Korea--another
apparent suicide motivated by despair over not being included.</TE>
<TE>   For this fourth round of reunions, participants were originally
selected at the end of September with the expectation of meeting
relatives in mid-October. But North Korea's abrupt cancellation and
the ensuing six-month delay meant that four of the 200 did not make
it: Two died, and two others were too ill to travel to the North
Korean resort at Mt. Kumgang, where the reunions are being held.</TE>
<TE>   Eo Byung Seon died at the age of 92 on Friday--just two days
before she was to meet a daughter whom she had not seen since 1950.
Lee Shin Ho was forcibly recruited by the North Korean army at the
age of 14 in the family's hometown of Namwon, South Korea, which at
the time was occupied by the North. But her mother never stopped
grieving for her missing daughter and each year on Shin Ho's birthday
prepared a special meal.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother cried and cried when the October reunions were
canceled. She was so disappointed. She knew that at her age, she
wouldn't make it to the next round. 'I'm too old. I won't have
another chance,' she kept telling us, and she was right," said
another daughter, Lee Bu Ja.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Min Ha, 69, a retired bureaucrat from Taegu, South Korea, who
Wednesday is to meet a long-estranged brother in the North, says his
biggest regret is that his mother isn't alive to attend. She died a
year ago at the age of 101, after a lifetime of grieving for three
children who went to North Korea with the North's army during the
war.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched my mother crying day and night. It was always a mystery
to me how a human body could produce so many tears," Kim said. "But
she stayed alive until 101 out of mothering instinct. It was waiting
for her children that kept her alive for so long."</TE>
<TE>   Park Im Hak, 73, who remembers vividly telling his sister, "See
you next week" when he last saw her at a port in North Korea, has
been waiting more than half a century to keep his date. Although
passed over all four times for reunions, he says he will keep himself
alive and healthy for as long as it takes.</TE>
<TE>   Chung In Kook's family advised him similarly: Live long, live
well, be patient. Even during the funeral, his widow berated him.</TE>
<TE>   "If only you had waited a little longer, you might have seen your
son. Who knows, maybe even your parents. Why didn't you wait?" she
recalls crying out.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with his will, the family threw Chung's ashes into the
Imjin River with the hope that somehow the waters would take what
remained of him back to North Korea.</TE>

<DH>Violence: Students demand reforms and lawmakers blame one
another after deadly German rampage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ERFURT, Germany</DL>
<LD>While Germans mourned the victims of a school shooting that left 17
dead, the tragedy was politicized Monday as politicians traded
charges and students in this eastern state capital held a rally
demanding school reforms.</LD>
<LD>   The gathering of about 1,000 students from Erfurt schools was part
memorial, part protest, but most of all a kind of open-air
stream-of-consciousness group therapy session. Organizers provided a
microphone, at which one speaker after another, most of them teenage
students, said whatever was on his or her mind.</LD>
<LD>   A few students thanked or memorialized their teachers. Others
called for reforms to reduce academic pressure and make school more
interesting. Many expressed bitterness at what they saw as
insensitive and intrusive media coverage of the rampage. Some also
complained that politicians have been journeying to Erfurt, the
capital of Thuringia state, since the shootings to boost their
election campaigns.</LD>
<TE>   The rally began after a minute of silence during which much of
Germany paused at 11:05 a.m., exactly three days after the moment
when a janitor at the Johann Gutenberg secondary school called police
to say that a gunman was shooting people.</TE>
<TE>   In an apparent act of revenge for having been expelled, Robert
Steinhaeuser, 19, walked into the school and killed 13 school
employees, two students, a police officer and finally himself. Police
said the killer belonged to two gun clubs, owned his weapons legally
and had violent video and computer games at home.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to ban violent electronic games moved to center stage in
partisan politics. A top conservative politician blamed the Social
Democratic-led governing coalition for failing to take action against
them.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not even a draft law on banning such programs," Bavarian
Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein said. Though the upper house of
Parliament called for such a ban two years ago, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's government "scandalously remained inactive," said
Beckstein, who is in line to become federal interior minister if
Bavarian Gov. Edmund Stoiber, the conservative challenger to
Schroeder, wins the September national election.</TE>
<TE>   Social Democratic and Greens politicians immediately fired back.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Beckstein speaks of scandalous inactivity; I speak of
scandalous behavior by Mr. Beckstein," Interior Minister Otto Schily
told state-run ZDF television. "Someone who tries to stir the
election campaign in such a shameless and indecent way disqualifies
himself for a federal post. He clearly doesn't have the ability to
conduct politics at this level."</TE>
<TE>   Volker Beck, a spokesman for the Greens, accused the conservatives
of trying to "exploit the terrible crime of Erfurt for their
campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Classes at most Erfurt schools were either canceled or spent
commemorating the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Many children made small drawings and posters in memory of those
killed, then went with teachers in groups to place the messages with
the thousands of flowers set in front of the Gutenberg school. A
formal memorial service for the victims is scheduled for Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Stoiber visited the school Monday and added a bouquet.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a time for mourning and condolences," he said. "We need
stricter intolerance of the glorification of violence and the
acceptance of violence in society."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder came to Erfurt on Saturday, and several other top
national politicians have visited. In Berlin on Monday, Schroeder
called for the tightening of gun laws, including raising the legal
age for owning certain weapons from 18 to 21.</TE>
<TE>   At the student rally, a young woman who said she was studying to
be a teacher complained that politicians "carry out their election
campaign on the backs of dead people." She declined to give her name.</TE>
<TE>   Speakers targeted journalists, especially photographers and TV
crews, for their harshest criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are the media doing this?" Stefan Walluhn, a university
student and rally organizer, said from the stage. "There's a
financial interest. The financial interest is higher than human
relationships.... Objective reporting, fine, but it's not necessary
to show brutal pictures again and again."</TE>
<TE>   After many other speakers heaped abuse on reporters, often using
obscenities, Michael Pletinski, a cameraman for Erfurt TV, went to
the microphone.</TE>
<TE>   "Who of you saw something brutal on Erfurt TV?" he asked. "We were
working for three days, day and night, to give objective information
to the citizens of Erfurt. If you throw all media and all reporters
in one pot, think about what you do."</TE>
<TE>   The rally took on an increasingly political tone as it progressed,
with speakers debating whether to march to the state education
offices to demand that authorities pay more attention to students'
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think you can turn this into some left-wing demonstration,
you are stupid," a teenager finally told the crowd. "We are
mourning."</TE>
<TE>   In front of Gutenberg school, there were no such conflicts.
Streams of somber children and adults continued to bring flowers and
pay their respects.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was Foulemtou Toure, 12, a sixth-grader at a nearby
school, who contributed a sheet of paper with rain clouds drawn on
one side, a bright sun on the other, and the words: "Like lightning,
a hateful event hit us. We shouldn't remember it with hate, but
instead overcome it."</TE>
<TE>   "The rain is the sad event," she said, explaining her artwork.
"And when you overcome it, then comes the sun."</TE>

<HD>As Arafat Deal Is Finalized, West Bank Sees New Battles</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinians say their leader will be mobile
again. Israeli move into Hebron leaves nine dead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS and REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Israel said Monday that, after weeks of confinement, Yasser Arafat is
free to "go where he chooses," but the Palestinian leader remained in
his battered compound as elements of the deal for his release fell
into place.</LD>
<LD>   "We have guarantees that the siege on President Arafat will be
lifted and that he will be able to leave the country and return at
any time," said Yasser Abed Rabbo, minister of information in the
Palestinian Authority.</LD>
<LD>   Israel has restricted Arafat's movements since December and has
confined him to his offices for four weeks.</LD>
<TE>   Expectations for Arafat's imminent departure came as a large force
of Israeli troops, backed by nearly two dozen tanks, rolled into the
West Bank city of Hebron and as a standoff continued at the Church of
the Nativity in Bethlehem, where scores of militants and civilians
have been holed up for a month.</TE>
<TE>   Gun battles broke out in several neighborhoods in Hebron, a
predominantly Palestinian city that is also home to several hundred
Jewish settlers.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians reported that nine people, including six civilians,
were killed in the Israeli incursion, which began before dawn.</TE>
<TE>   In one incident, six people were said to have been killed when an
Israeli attack helicopter fired rockets into a house where an
activist of Arafat's Fatah faction was hiding. The activist and five
others were killed, Palestinians said.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, it is pretty quiet. But last night, when I moved my
mattress into the living room for more safety, it was quite scary,"
said Ib Knutsen, press officer for the Temporary International
Presence in Hebron.</TE>
<TE>   The observer mission of six nations was established to monitor
Israel's redeployment out of some Hebron neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Knutsen said the 55 observers were confined to their barracks in
three bases as fighting raged.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't feel that we are in danger, but this is the most massive
operation the army has launched in Hebron," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night, soldiers continued to search house to house for
militants in what the army termed a "limited" operation.</TE>
<TE>   An army spokesman said at least 17 wanted militants were among
more than 200 men arrested.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it found two suitcases of explosives and a car bomb
primed for detonation.</TE>
<TE>   The operation came two days after Palestinian gunmen from the
militant Islamic movement Hamas raided a nearby Jewish settlement on
the Jewish Sabbath, shooting dead four people, among them a
5-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Radio reported that one of the Palestinians killed in
Hebron had been the "controller" of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops entered the village of Shawara, east of Bethlehem,
early this morning and began arresting residents, according to an
army spokesman. There were no immediate reports of casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking before a committee of the Knesset, Israel's parliament,
Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Monday that troops would
not stay on the Palestinian side for long.</TE>
<TE>   "We went there to hit that infrastructure [of militias] and get
out quickly," Ben-Eliezer said.</TE>
<TE>   But Israel has made it clear, even as it pulls out of
Palestinian-controlled areas, that it reserves the right to reenter
at will to arrest militants and thwart attacks. And it is keeping
tight blockades around all major West Bank cities, cordoning them off
with tanks and roadblocks.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, the president of the Palestinian Authority, has said that
he will not discuss a cease-fire with Israel until it withdraws its
troops from all areas occupied since March 29 in response to a string
of suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has repeatedly urged Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon to complete the pullout.</TE>
<TE>   An aide to Arafat said he would leave his Ramallah offices only
after six wanted Palestinians sheltered there are transferred to a
prison near the West Bank city of Jericho, where U.S. and British
troops will guard them under an agreement brokered by the Bush
administration over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said a British
advance team had already arrived in the region and would soon be
joined by an American representative.</TE>
<TE>   Abed Rabbo said he thought the detainees, Arafat's financial
advisor and five men convicted of involvement in the October
assassination of Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi, would be transferred
by today.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Palestinians are under lock and key, Israel is to
withdraw its remaining troops and tanks from Ramallah, paving the way
for Arafat's departure.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, Arafat can go where he chooses," said Ben-Eliezer.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was happy with the signs of diplomatic progress.
Right-wing politicians heaped scorn on Sharon for reversing himself
and agreeing to the U.S. compromise on the six wanted men in
Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Yiftah-Palmach Zeevi, son of the slain tourism minister and a
candidate for the leadership of his father's ultranationalist party,
said Sharon's decision was a personal betrayal and a national
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   And in the streets of Ramallah, residents said Arafat should never
have agreed to let the U.S. and Britain guard the Palestinians. Some
also criticized Arafat for convicting those accused in Zeevi's
killing during a trial inside his headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are fighters for freedom," said a man who identified
himself only as Fadi, 24, the owner of a shoe shop in downtown
Ramallah. "It is unacceptable to bring American and British people to
keep them in jail. It is a big mistake and will divide the
Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   Five of the six men at the center of the U.S. deal to end the
siege are members of the Palestine Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a radical faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization; one of them, Ahmed Saadat, is the leader of the group.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Saadat's deputy, Abdul Rahim Mallouh, criticized Arafat
for agreeing to give American and British guards control over the
Palestinian men.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need other jails. The whole Palestinian people are
already in an Israeli jail," Mallouh said in an interview at a
Ramallah hotel. "We have so many security apparatuses that can
oppress the Palestinian people, whether they are Israeli or
Palestinian, and now these others."</TE>

<HD>Cartel Used Papal Envoy, Book Relates</HD>
<DH>Mexico: Ramon Arellano Felix sent nuncio to intervene with
the president, former attorney general writes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The Arellano Felix brothers used the papal nuncio as a personal
emissary to request a meeting with President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari to plead their innocence in the May 1993 killing of Cardinal
Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo at the Guadalajara airport, according to a
new book.</LD>
<LD>   And although Salinas knew that Ramon Arellano Felix was in the
nuncio's Mexico City residence awaiting his answer, he and his
attorney general, the author of the book, decided not to have him
arrested because the prospect was too risky, a possible trap that
could cost the lives of the nuncio, who is the Vatican's envoy, and
other clerics. Those disclosures are included in the book by former
Atty. Gen. Jorge Carpizo MacGregor, now a researcher at Mexico's
National Autonomous University. Carpizo also served as Salinas'
interior minister.</LD>
<LD>   Titled "Killing of a Cardinal" and cowritten by Julian Andrade,
the book hit bookstores Monday and is the most detailed and
authoritative account yet of the cleric's murder, which nine years
later continues to generate suspicion, controversy and conspiracy
theories.</LD>
<TE>   The book also provides richly detailed descriptions of the
pervasive corruption that the Arellano Felix gang and other drug
cartels have engendered in Mexican government, police forces and, the
authors allege, corners of the Roman Catholic Church. It provides
gory details of the long-standing and bloody feuds between drug gangs
that may have been at the root of the February killing of Ramon
Arellano Felix in Mazatlan. U.S. officials believe that Ramon, the
cartel's enforcer, was "executed" by police acting at the behest of
drug kingpin Ismael Zambada.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never shirked my responsibility to say the truth when I
occupied a public position. And the truth is that the corruption of
these drug networks is not just Mexico's problem but that of the
entire world," said Carpizo, 58, who has written 11 other books.</TE>
<TE>   Posadas Ocampo was shot 14 times in the parking lot of the
Guadalajara airport, his car mistaken by Arellano Felix hit men for a
car owned by Sinaloa drug king Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman. At least
that's the official conclusion, reached by three separate federal
investigations, including Carpizo's.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics--who include Posadas Ocampo's successor, Cardinal Juan
Sandoval Iniguez, and the Mexican council of bishops--say the
government either botched the investigations or is covering up for
the real killers. Church officials are pressuring the government to
reopen the case.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal's slaying--and now the book--are windows on Mexicans'
attitudes toward their government and conspiracy theories. Although
no solid evidence supports a plot, many here are convinced that there
was one. Carpizo is an apologist for the real killers to some, a
fearless guardian of truth to others.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Chabat, an international relations professor at the Center
for Economic Research and Teaching here, said conspiracy theories
come naturally to Mexicans, who for decades have lived in a country
where there is "no transparency, no accountability."</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, a plot is the only way to understand something in
Mexico because there are so many strange things happening here,"
Chabat said. "I don't believe that the cardinal was killed as a
result of confusion. There probably was a plot. It's that no one
knows who organized it."</TE>
<TE>   Disagreeing is Roberto Blancarte, a professor and religion expert
at Colegio de Mexico here, who says no convincing scenario has been
put forth to support a conspiracy theory. The durability of
conspiracy theories merely proves Mexicans' suspicions about justice,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always wondered why, without any evidence, Cardinal
Sandoval sticks to disagreeing with the attorney general's finding,"
Blancarte said. "Maybe he doesn't want to back away from his first
denunciation, or this issue is helping him consolidate his position
in the Mexican church." Sandoval was not available for comment Monday
but has vigorously maintained his call for a new investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Carpizo recounted the surreal night in December
1993 when he was called to a meeting at the presidential residence
Los Pinos with Salinas and the Vatican's representative in Mexico,
Girolamo Prigione.</TE>
<TE>   Hardly believing his ears, Carpizo was told by Prigione that Ramon
Arellano Felix, who was considered among the country's most dangerous
criminals, was in the nuncio's residence in Mexico City minutes away,
awaiting an answer to his request to meet with Salinas.</TE>
<TE>   Salinas, at Carpizo's urging, turned down the request. Then after
the papal representative invoked diplomatic immunity, he and Carpizo
decided not to have Arellano Felix arrested, partly because of the
violence it would involve and partly because Carpizo wasn't sure he
could mount an effective operation in the few minutes he had.</TE>
<TE>   In his book, Carpizo claims that evidence shows cartel chief Ramon
Arellano Felix and his brother Javier were at the airport during the
shootout. He accuses a Tijuana priest, Gerardo Montano, who arranged
Ramon Arellano Felix's meeting with the nuncio, of giving Ramon an
alibi on the day of the murder by falsifying a Tijuana baptismal
record to show they were present.</TE>
<TE>   Montano in recent days has publicly denied that he did anything
wrong. He told reporters that he assisted the gang in his duties as a
priest and as a favor to his childhood friend, Ruth Arellano Felix,
the wife of Benjamin. Carpizo maintains that Montano committed a
crime by not turning the Arellano Felix brothers in to police.</TE>

<HD>Musharraf's Credibility in Balance</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: Referendum today will show whether release of
militants has undercut president's popularity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>President Pervez Musharraf is asking voters to extend his rule today,
but since he is the only choice on the referendum ballot, the real
question is whether his credibility will survive the vote.</LD>
<LD>   Musharraf, an army general who seized power in a bloodless 1999
coup, is seeking five more years in power without standing in a
democratic election.</LD>
<LD>   In Islamabad, the capital, turnout appeared low soon after polls
opened at 9 a.m. today. Yasir Mehmood, 22, was working the pumps at a
Shell gas station and said he didn't plan to vote.</LD>
<TE>   "We belong to that segment of society that can't say anything
about any government," Mehmood said through an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   About 50 men were lined up to vote next to the emergency ward at
Capital Hospital, all of them government workers from the same agency
that runs the hospital: the Capital Development Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Rafiq Hussain Shah, 30, an office clerk in the development
authority, said he and the rest of his colleagues would vote for
Musharraf because they believe that his policies are good for the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "The politicians are making a hue and cry because they aren't
getting any opportunities to indulge in corruption," Shah said.
"That's why they're making all sorts of noises about the referendum."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf had won strong support by forcing out corrupt
politicians and rounding up Islamic extremists. But in recent weeks,
he has released suspected militants and some of their leaders from
detention and sought support from religious hard-liners, which has
undercut his popularity, Pakistani analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "He has damaged himself," said lawyer Abid Hasan Minto, former
head of the Supreme Court Bar Assn. "People who have seen him aligned
with people of the character he has chosen have become doubtful and
suspicious of what his future will be."</TE>
<TE>   Opposition groups are urging their supporters to boycott today's
referendum. They say the vote is illegal and stacked in Musharraf's
favor so that he can force through changes that will strengthen his
power, and the military's, for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has said he will consider the referendum binding if more
than 35% of eligible voters cast ballots. To boost his chances, he
lowered the legal voting age from 21 to 18 and declared the country a
single constituency so that people can vote at any polling place they
choose. There are no voter rolls for the referendum, which the
opposition says is an opening to widespread fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "Tricks or no tricks, the result of the referendum is already
known," Minto said. "In fact, Pervez Musharraf has said more than
once himself, 'I have gone for this referendum only because I want a
positive result.' So that is the end of the matter."</TE>
<TE>   On April 5, Musharraf told the nation in a televised speech that
he planned to continue holding power as army chief of staff and
president at the same time. He also said he would try to amend the
constitution to give the military a permanent role in government.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that his plans for a national security council
made up mainly of generals had stirred fears in Pakistan, which has
been ruled by military regimes for half of the nearly 55 years since
the country was born at the end of British rule.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a negative perception that it will destabilize the
elected government, but that is not true," Musharraf said. "The
security council's job will be to keep checks on everyone--the
president, prime minister and the chief of army staff--to stop
unbalanced, impulsive actions."</TE>
<TE>   Without mentioning details, Musharraf repeated in a televised
address Monday night that he intends to amend the constitution and
allow Pakistan's people a say in the reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf held 23 rallies in the three-week referendum campaign.
Several were nationally televised. The opposition was allowed to hold
only one public meeting, late in the referendum campaign, and with
little notice to enable it to call out supporters.</TE>
<TE>   When doctors wanted to back Musharraf's referendum, they were
allowed to rally. But when lawyers went on strike to protest the
vote, police detained scores of them.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Tariq Mehmood resigned from the country's election
commission because he considered the referendum unconstitutional, and
then he was forced to resign from the high court bench in the
province of Baluchistan.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said friends and colleagues "fear that my telephone is
being bugged, and if the government discovers that any of them share
my views, they will also face similar consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Although the president's opponents have joined in the Alliance for
the Restoration of Democracy to boycott the referendum, they are weak
and divided against the general's military regime, which portrays
itself as the savior of Pakistani democracy.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and other foreign governments have issued only
muted criticism of Musharraf's effort to consolidate power, but Minto
said that's probably a good thing because Pakistanis need to mature
and struggle for political changes on their own.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Regains Seat on Rights Panel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The United States regained a seat on the U.N. Human Rights Commission
on Monday, a year after a humiliating ouster from the panel it helped
create more than 50 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   A surprise upset in elections last May for the commission
sidelined the United States, while governments with poor human rights
records such as Sudan and Uganda won seats on the body designed to
monitor international human rights abuses. The defeat had more to do
with disorganization in the way candidates were chosen than with the
world's disenchantment with an increasingly isolated U.S. government.
But at a time when it needed more than ever to be seen as a global
leader, the Bush administration launched a yearlong lobbying effort
to reclaim a place at the table.</LD>
<LD>   This year, there were no surprises for the 53-member commission,
which is composed of representatives from five regional groups. The
winners were decided long before the election, as the Western
countries' group followed other regions' example, and put forward
only four candidates for the four seats set aside for Western
nations. In an elaborate deal brokered by Iceland's ambassador, Italy
and Spain dropped out of the race in March to clear the way for the
United States. Australia, Germany and Ireland will hold the other
three positions.</LD>
<TE>   There won't be much suspense in the future, either. The Western
group has agreed to rotate the seats among its members, with the U.S.
and Canada to be perennial seat-holders, taking an occasional
breather.</TE>
<TE>   "Human rights is a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy," said the
U.S. ambassador to the commission, Sichan Siv. "We have spoken, and
we continue to speak on the issue, whether we are on the commission
or not. But now that we are back on the commission, we look forward
very much to working to continue to promote this very important
issue," Siv said Monday after the results were announced.</TE>
<TE>   For the past year, U.S. diplomats have been able to observe at the
commission, but not to vote or introduce resolutions. But even with
the U.S. restored to full participation, the commission is leaning
even further away from enforcing American-style human rights ideals,
say critics.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. got what it wanted--an unopposed seat," said Joanna
Weschler, the U.N. representative of Human Rights Watch, an
independent watchdog group. "The big question is what it will do with
it. The United States has to help get the commission back into the
business of naming and shaming. Otherwise, whether the United States
is a member or not, the commission is going to sink into
irrelevance."</TE>
<TE>   Though the parent body, the U.N. Economic and Social Council, is
supposed to elect the members, the regions tend to decide the
seat-holders among themselves, reducing the election to more of an
affirmation of prearranged results. This year, three of the five
groups preselected their winners.</TE>
<TE>   That means more governments with sketchy human rights practices
are gaining seats on the commission and are able to deflect criticism
of their countries or allies, said David M. Malone, president of the
International Peace Academy, an independent think tank. "Human rights
violators increasingly seem to dominate the composition of the
commission and have been able to sharply limit the focus on
individual countries."</TE>
<TE>   At the recent Human Rights Commission session in Geneva, the group
declined to discuss reported repression in China, tempered criticism
of Russian abuses in Chechnya and agreed to end human rights
investigations in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the African group put forth Zimbabwe, which has a
questionable human rights record, as one of four uncontested
countries to represent the continent, along with Burkina Faso, Gabon
and Swaziland. The choice of Zimbabwe caused concern that "abusers'
solidarity" will gather force. "Governments need to make a country's
human rights record a key factor in selecting countries to the
commission," said Weschler. "This is what matters."</TE>

<HD>Israelis, U.N. Now at Odds</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Relations between world body and Jewish state
had been good. But a West Bank inquiry has roiled them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>To Israelis, it once again seems clear that the United Nations is not
to be trusted. With the backing of most of the Security Council and
General Assembly, Israeli Cabinet officials assert, U.N. officials
are on a vendetta against their country and determined to discredit
it in the eyes of the world.</LD>
<LD>   For the top staff of the U.N. Secretariat and U.N. agencies, and
many if not most of the foreign diplomats here, the old image of
Israel playing by its own rules, contemptuous of U.N. reprimands, is
decidedly back.</LD>
<LD>   The immediate dispute between Israel and the U.N. centers on an
investigation of Israel's incursion this month into a U.N. refugee
camp in the West Bank city of Jenin, an inquiry Israel at first
approved but now vows to block unless it can limit both the scope of
the probe and its legal consequences.</LD>
<TE>   The acrimonious confrontation, now in its second week with no
clear resolution, has reinforced old enmities and stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   In Israel, Gideon Meir, the chief spokesman for the Foreign
Ministry, denounced the United Nations on Monday as "an anti-Israeli
organization." Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, who had initially
welcomed the U.N. mission, told Israel Radio the day before that the
Jenin inquest was beginning to resemble "blood libel."</TE>
<TE>   At U.N. headquarters, where officials had agreed for three days
running to postpone the mission for one additional day in deference
to Israeli deliberations about whether to cooperate, there was
unconcealed exasperation as the Security Council was told Monday that
the Israeli Cabinet had not met to deliver a verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the council that I had disappointing news, in that the
Israeli Cabinet did not take a decision today as we had been led to
expect," Kieran Prendergast, undersecretary-general for political
affairs, said after briefing the council.</TE>
<TE>   Three hours earlier, U.N. officials had said it was their "clear
understanding" that the Israeli Cabinet would meet and provide a
written response outlining its position. Prendergast said he had been
told that the Israeli government planned to meet today.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council unanimously endorsed the fact-finding mission
April 19. All five permanent members, including the United States,
called on Israel to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   "All member states are bound by Security Council resolutions, and
Russia will insist Israel allow the mission to reach Jenin," Russian
Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   In London, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said it is "really
important for Israel and for Israel's reputation" to allow the
inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Straw told the British Broadcasting Corp. that he had called Peres
earlier Monday and said, "If you have nothing to hide, for Pete's
sake get this fact-finding mission in as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   And in Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the U.N. mission should go forward. The U.S. "view is that Israel has
raised some concerns, the U.N. has been responsive to these, and that
they should be able to work this out, and we hope they do that as
quickly as possible," Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the last week, diplomats from developing nations, and
in some cases West European countries as well, have blasted Israel
for allegedly killing unarmed civilians in the Jenin camp and for its
objections to the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli diplomats have angrily retorted that the U.N. should
investigate how a refugee camp under its supervision became a base
for terror attacks on Israeli civilians. Israelis charge that the
recruitment of forensic and legal experts on war crimes for the Jenin
investigation shows that Israel will be "prosecuted" by what one
minister called "this awful United Nations commission."</TE>
<TE>   U.N. observers say the vitriolic exchanges are reminiscent of the
days when the General Assembly denounced Zionism as racism and
Israeli governments ignored U.N. objections to Israel's annexation of
conquered territory.</TE>
<TE>   "The ... government [of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon] is
not helping things with the language that they are using," said
Rachel Bronson, a Middle East analyst at the Council on Foreign
Relations. "But the U.N. did not really help things either. It is a
terrible team. You have to have people schooled in urban warfare."</TE>
<TE>   Almost from the moment of its founding, Israel has had a
contentious relationship with the United Nations. Its military
control of lands seized from Syria, Egypt and Jordan after the 1967
Middle East War worsened tensions with the organization. Only a firm
alliance with the veto-wielding United States helped Israel avoid
direct confrontations with the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   But after it signed peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and
agreed in the Oslo accords to an eventual land-for-peace deal with
the Palestinians, Israel's relations with the United Nations notably
improved.</TE>
<TE>   However, old tensions resurfaced after the impasse at the July
2000 Camp David peace talks, the start of the Palestinian uprising
two months later and the subsequent election of Sharon as Israel's
prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few months ago, Kofi Annan was still held in high regard by
many Israelis. Yehuda Lancry, Israel's U.N. ambassador, said in an
interview in December that Annan was "the best secretary-general
Israel had ever had."</TE>
<TE>   Annan was clearly pushing to end Israel's isolation in the
organization, and two years ago Israel finally won seats on the
General Assembly committees that conduct much of the U.N.'s business.</TE>
<TE>   Lingering Israeli distrust of the U.N. as a neutral peacekeeper
along the Lebanese border resurfaced a year ago when it was
discovered that U.N. commanders had withheld videotaped documentation
of the abduction by Hezbollah guerrillas, who were disguised as U.N.
troops, of three Israeli soldiers from a border patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Although Annan was unaware of the videotape, the incident
undermined Israeli confidence in his leadership, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Annan on Monday reiterated his determination to proceed with the
Jenin investigation, saying it is "very urgent that we go in, find
out what happened, and put all the rumors and the accusations behind
us."</TE>
<TE>   A U.N. spokesman in Geneva said the fact-finding team, led by
former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, would not travel to the
Middle East until Annan had assurances of Israel's cooperation. The
spokesman said the 20 team members include British and French army
officers and an Irish counter-terrorism expert who were added after
Israel complained that the team lacked military expertise.</TE>

<HD>Bakley Heirs File Suit Against Blake</HD>
<DH>Court: Their attorney will ask that the civil proceedings
be delayed until criminal case is ended. Actor returns to courtroom
Wednesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bonny Lee Bakley's four children filed a wrongful-death lawsuit
against actor Robert Blake and his bodyguard Monday, a week after
both men were charged in her slaying.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit seeks unspecified general and punitive damages. It was
filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in Burbank five days
before the first anniversary of Bakley's death.</LD>
<LD>   Blake, 68, was arrested April 18 at his daughter's Hidden Hills
home and charged last week with fatally shooting Bakley, 44, his wife
of six months, near a Studio City restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   He is being held without bail at the Men's Central Jail in
downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Barry Novack, who filed the suit, said he plans to ask a
judge to halt civil proceedings until the criminal case is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to do anything to impede or impair the criminal
action," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If Blake is convicted of a felony, Bakley's heirs could seek
punitive damages, which can greatly increase the amount of a civil
judgment, Novack said. It also would make the task of proving civil
liability much easier.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley was killed May 4, 2001, while she sat in Blake's car near
Vitello's restaurant, where the couple had just eaten.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, best known for his 1970s television series "Baretta," told
authorities he had returned to the restaurant to retrieve his gun,
which he said he had left there by mistake, when Bakley was shot.</TE>
<TE>   He pleaded not guilty last week to murder, solicitation and
conspiracy. His bodyguard, Earle Caldwell, 46, of Burbank pleaded not
guilty to conspiracy and was released from jail Friday, after Blake
posted his $1-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   Both men are scheduled to appear in a Van Nuys courtroom Wednesday
to set a date for a preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The six-page civil complaint alleges that Bakley's children were
deprived of their mother's love, companionship, guidance, protection
and inheritance.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a warm, caring and loving mother," Novack said. Bakley
still helped support her grown children in Tennessee, paying their
rent and buying them cars, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's defense attorney, Harland W. Braun, said he assumed Blake
would be sued, but insisted his client is innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is that he didn't kill her, so there will be no basis
for [the lawsuit] at the end of the day," Braun said. "At this point,
there isn't anything linking him to the gun, nothing on his clothing
that would link him to the shooting and there's no witnesses to the
shooting."</TE>
<TE>   Blake married Bakley after a paternity test showed he had fathered
her child.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said prosecutors plan to show that Blake tried to hire two
stuntmen who worked on "Baretta" to kill her. Braun said he will
attack the stuntmen's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Suing for Bakley's heirs was Blanchard E. Tual, the
court-appointed administrator of Bakley's estate in Shelby County,
Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley's known heirs are her four children, Glenn Paul Gawron, 22;
Holly Lee Gawron, 21; and Jeri Lee Lewis, 8, all of Memphis; and Rose
Lenore Sophia Blake, 1, of Hidden Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Blake, the daughter of Bakley and Robert Blake, is being
cared for by Blake's oldest daughter, Delinah, 35. She was granted
temporary guardianship after their father's arrest and is seeking
permanent guardianship. She said in court papers that she has cared
for Rose since she was 3 months old.</TE>
<TE>   The Bakley family does not plan to contest Delinah Blake's court
petition for guardianship, their attorney, Cary W. Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   As one of Bakley's heirs, Rose Blake is automatically part of the
wrongful-death suit, Novack said.</TE>
<TE>   Margerry Bakley, Bonny's sister, defended her family's decision to
sue Blake on behalf of Bonny's children.</TE>
<TE>   "It has nothing to do with myself, my brother, my mother or anyone
else," she said. "We can never replace their mother, but this may
ease their lives a bit, help them through life a little."</TE>
<TE>   In other developments, an autopsy report, reviewed by The Times on
Monday, shows that Bakley was shot once in the right shoulder and
again in the right cheek at an upward angle.</TE>
<TE>   The document also found gunshot residue on both of Bakley's hands,
which indicates she may have tried to protect herself.</TE>
<TE>   In another report, the Los Angeles County coroner's office found
gunshot residue on Blake's hands and clothing, but determined it
could have come from a source other than the murder weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "If Mr. Blake is in the environment of firearms, i.e., handles
firearms on a regular basis, then these results could be the result
of that contact,"' the coroner's report said.</TE>
<TE>   Another forensic report found no fingerprints on the murder
weapon, magazine or cartridge.</TE>

<HD>School Bus Service Returning to Normal</HD>
<DH>Labor: L.A. Unified contractor fields drivers on most
routes for first day back after a three-week strike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>School bus service returned almost to normal Monday in the Los
Angeles Unified School District after a three-week strike by drivers
employed by the district's largest bus contractor, Laidlaw Education
Services.</LD>
<LD>   At Daniel Webster Middle School in West Los Angeles, Principal
David Legacki said spirits were high. "This morning there were no
late buses," he said.</LD>
<LD>   During the strike, many sports games and field trips were
canceled, and some students throughout the sprawling district arrived
at school up to an hour late.</LD>
<TE>   Webster students, for example, missed out on field trips to the
Getty Center and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, schools and district officials reported no substantial
delays.</TE>
<TE>   Junior varsity sports events and field trips are now being
rescheduled.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to be back to normal," said Thane Opfell, a senior
administrator at Monroe High School in North Hills, who was filling
in for a vacationing principal Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Teamsters Local 572, which represents more than 800
drivers employed by Laidlaw, voted Sunday to approve a new three-year
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiated late Friday night, the contract brought an end to a
bitter strike that disrupted transportation for nearly 20,000
students.</TE>
<TE>   About 55,000 students in the district are on bus routes served by
other companies or district-owned vehicles. The district used those
other firms and its own drivers to transport students on the Laidlaw
routes during the strike.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Laidlaw fielded drivers on all but 42 of its 707
routes; district officials covered the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the school district and the union said the missing
drivers were not involved in any organized action or protest.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they said the missing drivers were probably unaware that
the strike had been settled. All drivers are expected to be back at
the wheel today.</TE>
<TE>   "When something like this happens," said school district
spokeswoman Cricket Bauer, "it takes people a little bit of time to
get back on their old schedules."</TE>

<HD>Bush Cites 'Hope' That Emerged From Violence of 10 Years
Ago</HD>
<DH>Politics: The president pushes his plan for religious
groups to take on a larger role in fighting poverty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush marked the 10th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots
Monday with a visit to South-Central Los Angeles to promote his plans
to give religious groups a bigger role in the fight against poverty.</LD>
<LD>   In the heart of a West Adams neighborhood ravaged by fire and
looting, Bush recalled the "civil unrest that made history" during
the final year of his father's presidency.</LD>
<LD>   Arriving in mid-afternoon, Bush met privately with 20 black,
Latino and Asian community leaders at an economic development office
of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church.</LD>
<TE>   They told him of efforts to revitalize the impoverished
neighborhoods that erupted in riots after white police officers were
acquitted in the beating of black motorist Rodney King.</TE>
<TE>   "I fully understand that 10 years ago this city, because of some
violence--a lot of violence--saw incredible destruction in lives and
in property," Bush later told 300 guests gathered in a nearby room.</TE>
<TE>   The visit to the church's FAME Renaissance Center, which provides
aid to small businesses, was Bush's first stop on a two-day swing
through California to raise money for Republican gubernatorial
nominee Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Bush was the main attraction at a Simon dinner at the
Century Plaza Hotel in Century City. Today, Bush is due to speak at
another Simon fund-raiser in the Silicon Valley. Simon said he
expects the events to raise more than $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   But more than the fund-raisers, the visit to a neighborhood struck
by the riots--a word Bush did not use on the anniversary--drew
notice.</TE>
<TE>   At the private session, Bush said, Charles Kim of the Korean
American Coalition had told him about "the dashed dreams of many of
the Korean entrepreneurs" whose businesses were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of hopes were lost," Bush said. "The violence and the
lawlessness always affects the most poor, always hurts the weakest,
and yet out of this violence and ugliness came new hope, and we
discussed that today."</TE>
<TE>   The riots that spread across the area 10 years ago were a low
point in his father's reelection campaign. While the Bush
administration blamed the riots partly on the Great Society programs
of the 1960s, Democratic rival Bill Clinton called for more
investment in poor neighborhoods and an increase in the minimum wage.
Clinton also sought to display his empathy by visiting the
devastation days before Bush.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Bush's son called attention to the urban revitalization
that has occurred. He noted that much of the improvement came from
faith-based programs such as FAME Renaissance, which works with
federal aid.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years after civil unrest that made history, the community is
rebuilding herself with great hope and great promise, and that's an
important lesson," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's proposal to allow religious groups to take on social
service functions traditionally performed by government has stalled
in Congress. Critics have voiced concern about breaches of the
constitutional separation of church and state. Bush rejected that
argument Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want government to be the church, and I don't want the
church to be the government," Bush said. "But government should not
fear faith and faith-based programs."</TE>
<TE>   "That's right!" a voice called from the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "Government should not worry," Bush continued, "about programs
that come out of church or synagogue or mosque, all aimed at loving a
neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself. The universal
call to love is something to be nourished, not feared. There is a
role for government. When we fund programs, we ought not to
discriminate against faith-based programs."</TE>
<TE>   Among those meeting with Bush were the Rev. Cecil "Chip" Murray,
senior pastor at First AME church; Bishop Charles E. Blake, pastor of
West Angeles Church of God in Christ; John Bryant, founder and chief
executive of Operation HOPE, a nonprofit urban renewal group; Antonia
Hernandez, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense &amp;
Educational Fund; and Kim.</TE>
<TE>   FAME Renaissance is located in a renovated office building on West
Adams Boulevard and Western Avenue. Before Bush's arrival, the Rev.
Mark Whitlock, FAME's executive director, looked across West Adams
Boulevard and recalled the devastation of April 29, 1992. Bottles,
bricks and firebombs were crashing through liquor store windows.
Flames were shooting out of a nearby office building and apartment
complex.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years have gone by, and much has happened, but much needs to
be accomplished," he said. "One of the most powerful men in the world
has an opportunity to see what we see instead of reading what we see.
He has resources--not only human, but capital resources to make a
significant change."</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Logwood, 37, a nurse buying groceries across the street,
agreed. "With all the things that are going on in the world today,
it's a good thing that he's taking the time to come to the community
and find out what's going on," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Others were more skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not naive," said D.A. Ballinger, 48, a vending machine
salesman who lives nearby in West Adams. "If he was coming here
saying, 'I'm going to sign a bill giving $1 billion to the cities so
we can rebuild,' now that I could support. But he's not doing that.
If you're going to come, come correct. That's what we say in the
'hood."</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Parsky, Bush's chief political operative in California,
said Bush's visit was meant to show that he "understands it's
important to reach out and provide opportunity for people."</TE>
<TE>   "He's a person of inclusion, a president for all the people, and
economic development in the inner city is an important part of his
program," Parsky said.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Community Development Commission is seeking
public comment on a plan that details how the county will allocate
$80 million in federal housing and community development funds.</LD>
<LD>   Residents may submit written comments on the 2002-03 Action Plan,
which proposes how the county should spend the money on a range of
services, including child care, senior programs, home buyer
assistance, home repair services, graffiti removal, and street and
sewer repairs.</LD>
<LD>   The money will be used in unincorporated areas of the county and
in 48 cities.</LD>
<TE>   Besides taking written comments for a month, the Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors will hold a public hearing May 28, the
day it is scheduled to vote on the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The draft and hearing comments then go to the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development for review and final approval.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for selected programs begins July 1, with amendments and
additional funding possible throughout the year, CDC spokesman Calvin
Naito said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents can view the plan at CDC headquarters in Monterey Park,
at specified libraries in each of the five supervisorial districts,
and on the commission's Web site (www.lacdc.org/action_plan2001/
index.htm). The Web site also includes a list of public libraries
that have copies of the plan.</TE>

<HD>6 Considered to Temporarily Replace Parks</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Police Commission narrows list to three high-ranking
members and three retired veterans. Candidates for permanent chief's
job are excluded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police commissioners looking for a temporary replacement
for Chief Bernard C. Parks have narrowed their list of candidates to
three high-ranking department members and three retired veterans,
officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The commission is expected to meet behind closed doors today to
discuss who should lead the Los Angeles Police Department--and
oversee the implementation of scores of court-mandated reforms--while
the city conducts a nationwide search for a new chief.</LD>
<LD>   The interim chief would be prohibited from applying for the
chief's position because the Police Commission did not want
applicants to use the temporary job as a springboard.</LD>
<TE>   "It creates an inherent conflict if the interim chief has an
application in to be permanent chief," said commission President Rick
Caruso. "This way, it just keeps the process cleaner and more
straight forward."</TE>
<TE>   According to City Hall sources, those up for consideration
include:</TE>
<TE>   * Deputy Chief Mike Bostic, who is in charge of recruitment,
hiring and training of new officers. Bostic, who spent Monday
presenting the LAPD's proposed 2002-03 budget to members of the City
Council, is filling in as acting chief.</TE>
<TE>   * Cmdr. Tom Lorenzen, who heads the department's internal affairs
unit. He was responsible for helping plan deployment and policing for
the Democratic National Convention in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   * Deputy Chief Julius I. Davis, a 35-year veteran. He is in charge
of the LAPD's specialized units, including the homicide detectives,
narcotics officers and the SWAT team.</TE>
<TE>   * Former Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy, who retired last year after
31 years. He worked for Parks on a variety of special projects,
including helping draft police reforms as part of a court-mandated
consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   * Former Deputy Chief Scott LaChasse, a 32-year veteran who
recently retired after serving as head of the LAPD's South Los
Angeles bureau. He now works for Paramount Studios on security
issues.</TE>
<TE>   * Former Deputy Chief Larry Fetters, who retired as head of human
resources for the department in 1994. Fetters was given the task of
expanding recruitment for the department during former Mayor Richard
Riordan's tenure.</TE>
<TE>   The commission rejected Parks' request for a second five-year term
earlier this month, and last week the chief announced he would step
down May 3.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, commissioners and city officials have privately
queried department brass to identify people who would be interested
in the temporary job.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they were hopeful that the commission would
decide on an interim chief today.</TE>
<TE>   The panel, however, cannot formally appoint an interim chief until
it receives a letter of resignation from Parks, who is out of town on
vacation.</TE>
<TE>   While officials have focused on the six candidates, the list
remains somewhat fluid, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, some city officials were discussing the possibility of
adding Joe Gunn, the executive director of the Police Commission, to
the short list.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Dan Koenig, who works on consent decree issues and other
administrative duties, also has been mentioned as a possible
candidate.</TE>

<HD>Police Resistance to Gutting DARE Program Angers Panel</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Commission urges shifting officers in the school
anti-drug effort to patrol.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Commission members didn't shrink at ousting a
powerful and popular police chief. But they seem to have found a more
formidable adversary in DARE, the LAPD's longtime drug-abuse
education program.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioners first talked about gutting DARE's staff two months
ago to free up more officers for the LAPD's depleted narcotics and
gang units.</LD>
<LD>   The deliberations have unfolded quietly in recent months in the
shadow of the higher-profile controversy over the commission's
rejection of a second five-year-term for Chief Bernard C. Parks.</LD>
<TE>   Parks is now out, but DARE remains standing. Despite
commissioners' repeated requests, LAPD officials have yet to provide
them with the "creative solutions" they had requested so that most
DARE officers might be temporarily shifted to other duties and the
program replaced by something else.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, as the debate stretches into its third month, LAPD brass
appears to be more interested in arguing DARE's merits and protecting
it from further cuts than in responding to the commission's requests.</TE>
<TE>   At the commission's most recent meeting on DARE, little progress
was made, and the discussion was continued into next week.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than working toward resolution, police officials and
commissioners seemed to argue past each other.</TE>
<TE>   Pressed to come up with a replacement for DARE, Deputy Chief J.I.
Davis dug in his heels. "DARE has a very positive role," he told
commissioners calmly.</TE>
<TE>   On the commissioners' side, though, patience was wearing thin.
"Didn't we ask for some creative solutions?" Commissioner Silvia
Saucedo asked. "Wasn't that due to us today?"</TE>
<TE>   She didn't get an answer from the assembled LAPD officials. But
commission President Rick Caruso offered one instead. "Yeah," he
grumbled, "it was. And we got a new memo that just says, 'No.'"</TE>
<TE>   At issue for the Police Commission is a more far-reaching question
than the future of school-based anti-drug officers: how to persuade
LAPD officials to do what civilian overseers want.</TE>
<TE>   For years, critics have griped that the LAPD's paramilitary
culture has resisted civilian oversight to the detriment of civil
rights, and that the Police Commission--civilians appointed by the
mayor to oversee the department--has never quite managed to assert
sufficient control.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the police commissioners, most of them appointed last year by
Mayor James K. Hahn, want to establish their authority as managers in
ways they believe eluded their predecessors. And they are learning
just how difficult that can be.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a cultural thing," Caruso said. "There is a history
of giving an answer that is not really an answer and hoping it just
goes away."</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners began considering ways to reduce or eliminate DARE
in February in response to concerns that narcotics crime-fighting
units, in particular, had been cut excessively and that officers
needed to be transferred from elsewhere to help rebuild them.</TE>
<TE>   They were responding in part to the protests of a group of Boyle
Heights residents, who in arguing passionately for more narcotics
officers, cited rising gang violence.</TE>
<TE>   The department's overall personnel crisis results from a shortage
of police recruits that has most profoundly affected specialized
units. Strapped for officers, the department has been shifting people
from these units back to patrol to ensure sufficient numbers to
answer emergency calls.</TE>
<TE>   The DARE program has been among those cut, but it has not lost as
many positions as narcotics.</TE>
<TE>   DARE is now allotted 119 officers on paper but, in reality, it is
functioning with 71. Hahn's proposed city budget for next year would
in essence make the vacancies permanent, capping it at 74 officers.</TE>
<TE>   But the commission wants the number of sworn officers cut to about
six, with civilians or retired officers taking up the slack.</TE>
<TE>   DARE deploys uniformed police officers to schools to educate
children on the perils of drug use. The program was created by the
LAPD in 1983 and has since spread worldwide. Although DARE's
effectiveness has been questioned by some experts, its rapid
expansion in Los Angeles and elsewhere testifies to its popularity.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say that, besides discouraging drug use, DARE improves
school safety by bringing officers to campuses and is also a valuable
officer recruitment tool. Moreover, LAPD officials argue that the
program represents one of the department's few efforts that focuses
on crime prevention, and that it would be short-sighted to gut it to
meet short-term needs.</TE>
<TE>   The program also is a point of pride for the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the achievements of LAPD in the last 50 years, the
two things that have been most innovative are SWAT and DARE," said
Charlie Parsons, executive director of DARE America, the nonprofit
corporation that sponsors the program. "To consider dropping DARE is
incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Caruso counters that, in the face of rising
gang violence, the department cannot afford to keep 71 officers in
the drug education program.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew when I raised this it was not going to be the most popular
issue, but I think you have to balance priorities," Caruso lectured
Davis and another acting chief, Michael Bostic, at the panel's most
recent meeting. "There are people dying in the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Previously, commissioners had asked police officials to suggest
ways to keep the program in an altered form, perhaps by using retired
officers or civilians, while allowing most sworn officers to be
transferred, leaving just half a dozen now assigned to magnet
schools.</TE>
<TE>   But to Caruso's consternation, police officials responded by
explaining that such options would not work, presenting commissioners
with what he called an "all or nothing" dilemma.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials have defended the response. "We cannot lie to him,"
said DARE Capt. Mark Perez.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting lengthy public debate at the panel's recent meeting
often seemed to go in circles.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials touted the benefits of DARE and argued that if its
officers were transferred, the program might never be restored.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners replied that they weren't questioning the merits of
the program but favored other priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think eliminating units is the answer," Bostic told
commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been asking for this for months!" Caruso shot back. As
the debate wore on, he slumped deeper into his chair, his chin
propped on one fist.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, LAPD Cmdr. Valentino Paniccia pushed him too far.
Paniccia suggested that the commission would "sacrifice thousands of
kids" in a misguided effort to bolster patrol units.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso bolted upright. "I think that's unfair!" he snapped. "Don't
lay that on my lap. Why don't you go to Boyle Heights and ask the
parents how they feel about kids being shot?"</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the commission tabled the issue for two weeks at the
request of Commissioner Rose Ochi, DARE's main backer on the panel.</TE>
<TE>   But Caruso said a majority of commissioners are close to deciding
to transfer DARE officers by fiat--whether the department likes it or
not.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD needs to get used to it, Caruso said. "This commission is
strong enough, and I am determined enough, that we are going to stand
our ground."</TE>

<HD>Man Shot Dead After Previous Attack</HD>
<DH>Violence: Santa Paula resident, slain outside his mother's
house, had survived a shooting a week ago but wouldn't cooperate with
police.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 29-year-old Santa Paula man was shot and killed behind his mother's
home, a week after surviving another shooting.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph McMullen was shot at least six times in the torso shortly
after 10 p.m. Sunday and died by the time authorities arrived, said
Santa Paula Police Chief Bob Gonzales.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses told police they heard voices in front of the house and,
moments later, several shots from the common area behind the 7th
Street home, one block south of Main Street. McMullen's mother was in
the house preparing for bed when the shots rang out only feet away,
Gonzales said.</LD>
<TE>   Police said an autopsy being performed Monday might provide clues
to both shootings.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of April 22, McMullen was shot once in the back
near his mother's home. He refused to cooperate when police tried to
interview him and left the hospital before doctors could extract the
bullet, Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a good possibility that the people who wanted to kill him
last week are the same people who wanted to kill him this week, but
when somebody is uncooperative it makes it hard to focus in [on
suspects]," the police chief said.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said McMullen once had connections to a local gang but
was not known to be affiliated with one at the time of his death. The
style of the shooting had no gang trademarks, Gonzales added.</TE>
<TE>   But McMullen did have a history of trouble with the law.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County court records show he served prison time for a 1994
burglary. Last year, he was charged in two other burglaries, each
involving accomplices; a judge dismissed charges against him in both
cases.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, friends and relatives gathered at the two-story home to
console McMullen's mother. A man identifying himself as McMullen's
brother said the family was too upset to comment. "We're just
speechless," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After a decade-long decline in crime, reported offenses in Santa
Paula rose nearly 13% last year, according to FBI statistics. Murders
and rapes dropped slightly, but burglaries, robberies and assaults
climbed.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said the city still is safer than in the mid-1990s and
that new policing programs are keeping gang and drug activity at bay.
Still, McMullen's death is the latest in a recent string of violence
in the blue-collar city of 30,000.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, a 24-year-old man was hospitalized with
gunshot wounds to his abdomen and an arm. In a separate shooting, two
men, 22 and 20, were shot. And in another incident this month, an
agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration shot a Santa Paula man
in the head after the man allegedly pointed a gun at the agent. All
of the shooting victims survived.</TE>
<TE>   McMullen's death was the sixth homicide in Ventura County this
year.</TE>

<HD>Oasis Not Making Anyone Thirsty</HD>
<DH>DWP: Agency's lush Japanese Garden in Van Nuys draws
admirers, but few would care to tap into its source.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 18 years, Los Angeles' Japanese Garden has serenely coexisted
next to a city water reclamation plant, "an oasis in the San Fernando
Valley" designed to make the idea of recycled water more palatable to
the public.</LD>
<LD>   But for all its gurgling streams, lush lawns, bonsai and carp, the
garden has failed to convince many about drinking water flushed from
its toilets.</LD>
<LD>   "I wouldn't drink it. ... Just knowing it came from the toilet or
the ocean doesn't appeal to me," said Effie Nathan of Northridge, who
visited the Van Nuys garden Sunday for its annual springtime event.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has put off any
"toilet-to-tap" program in favor of more public education on the
idea, said Gene Greene, manager of the Japanese Garden. The fact is,
purifying sewer water for drinking disgusts a lot of people, even
though, Greene said, "there's no new water in the world. It's all
recycled."</TE>
<TE>   The Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant treats waste water
from toilets, sinks and showers--65 million gallons daily--for
irrigation on city-owned land, mostly in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Tillman, a city engineer, came up with the idea for the Japanese
garden at the plant while taking a landscape design class at UCLA,
Greene said. The instructor, Koichi Kawana, became the garden's
designer.</TE>
<TE>   Spread over 61/2 acres, the garden is a popular spot for filming,
weddings and school field trips. Only planes from nearby Van Nuys
Airport disrupt the quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's event, organized by the garden's volunteer docents,
included demonstrations of origami, brush-painting, flower-arranging,
tai chi and sword fighting. Several hundred people toured the garden
and the adjacent sewage plant.</TE>
<TE>   Members of a Pasadena photography club, the Photochromers, shot
pictures for an upcoming contest. Member Kathy Moyd said she would be
inclined to drink reclaimed water, assuming it would be tested even
more stringently than other drinking water. However, she still needs
some convincing.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess if we get all our elected officials together, slugging it
down, maybe it would work," she said.</TE>

<HD>Base Workers Informed of Safety Issues Days Before Air Show
Crash</HD>
<DH>Accident: Navy officials surveyed the employees about
problems with maintenance of the jet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Days before a fatal jet crash at the Point Mugu Air Show, Navy
officials notified base employees that they had found "a significant
number of performance deficiencies and safety discrepancies" in the
aircraft's maintenance division.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Navy officials said that similar problems uncovered in
the QF-4 Phantom jet's maintenance program during a routine 1999
inspection had been corrected. The inspector's highly critical report
warned of potential safety hazards.</LD>
<LD>   If problems are not addressed, the inspector said at the time,
"they will have a devastating impact on the safety of air crew and
aircraft worthiness in the future."</LD>
<TE>   Despite assurances that improvements had been made, Navy officials
informed Point Mugu employees about continuing problems with the QF-4
jet program in a memo included in a worker survey distributed earlier
this month. The survey included 23 questions that covered everything
from worker skill levels and training to inquiries about the
program's overall safety.</TE>
<TE>   "What are some of the things that are preventing the QF-4
maintenance team from performing as well as it might?" was one
question posed to employees in the survey obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Another question: "What is your level of confidence that the work
performed by QF-4 maintenance ensures the safety of the QF-4 crew
members and aircraft?"</TE>
<TE>   After recent reviews, the survey stated, the base's command staff
"is now faced with the difficult decision of determining whether the
QF-4 maintenance group is capable of achieving the standards of
performance for safety of flight, aircraft availability and
productivity that must be met to ensure its continued existence,"
according to the memo.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials confirmed Monday that an employee survey was
conducted earlier this month at the Ventura County base, but said it
was part of an ongoing financial and operations audit and was not
solely focused on the QF-4 squadron's maintenance division. They
declined further comment about the survey and the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Navy spokeswoman Cathy Partusch said the safety record
of the QF-4 squadron is stellar, noting that the air show crash was
the only in-flight accident the fleet has experienced in 118,000
hours logged in the air. There are 20-plus planes in the squadron.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy is always looking to make sure that we do everything
safely," Partusch said. "Safety is our No. 1 goal."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said Monday he sent a letter
to Capt. Jim Rainwater, the base commander, requesting a meeting
about allegations of problems with the QF-4 jet program. But Gallegly
said he maintains complete confidence in Rainwater and other members
of the base's command staff.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that I sent a letter in no way means I want to impede on
an impartial investigation into this tragedy," Gallegly said. "The
purpose is to follow up on some serious allegations."</TE>
<TE>   Although the cause of the April 20 air show accident that killed
two aviators has not been determined, investigators have not ruled
out faulty maintenance, pilot error or mechanical malfunction.</TE>
<TE>   One civilian employee in the QF-4 hangar said Monday that the
Navy's recent survey was not taken seriously because it only vaguely
addressed safety concerns well-known among many in the squadron. The
employee received the survey two days before the air show accident.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it was just more smoke and mirrors," said the worker, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. "They still hadn't addressed the
problem and here is another report. It was like, here they come
again. They ask you all these questions and they want you to talk
your heart out, but they don't do anything."</TE>
<TE>   The employee survey did not mention specific maintenance problems
with the QF-4 jet program. Navy officials also reiterated that the
survey was part of an ongoing audit and is not evidence of serious
problems that could have led to the air show crash.</TE>
<TE>   They also pointed out that the jet involved in the accident was
delivered to Point Mugu in February from the Naval Aviation Depot in
North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Navy Lt. Cmdr. Michael Norman, 39, of Camarillo and Marine Capt.
Andrew Muhs, 31, who lived on the base, were killed when their jet
wobbled out of control and slammed into a marshy field during the air
show.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, two former Navy aircraft specialists said they warned
officials last summer that the maintenance program for the
Vietnam-era fighter jet was plagued with problems that could
jeopardize the safety of air crews.</TE>
<TE>   Darrell Ellington, a mechanic on the QF-4 Phantoms, and Ken
Okesson, a quality assurance specialist, said they made their
concerns known to base officials in resignation letters and
confidential exit interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Another Navy spokeswoman said last week that the Navy took the two
workers' concerns seriously but that "there were no specific
allegations cited upon which to act."</TE>
<TE>   Ellington and Okesson's warnings echoed the concerns of a Navy
inspector who two years earlier issued a highly critical report of
Point Mugu's civilian-operated QF-4 program. The report was part of a
regular annual inspection.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector's evaluation of the QF-4's quality assurance program
cited major problems with auditing procedures, maintenance record
keeping and overall management.</TE>
<TE>   Maintenance is "beginning to demonstrate tendencies of straying
from the straight and narrow paths required ... to ensure safe and
efficient aircraft," Lt. Cmdr. Gary Green wrote in his report.</TE>
<TE>   Green noted that he was especially concerned about poor record
keeping in the QF-4 maintenance division. "The neglect of this area
over the past months has resulted in a combination of discrepancies
that if not corrected could lead to possible loss of life, equipment
and weapon systems."</TE>

<HD>Lack of Permits Halts Grading at Juvenile Camp</HD>
<DH>Environment: Trabuco Canyon residents had contended that
the work jeopardized sensitive habitat. The county belatedly agreed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trabuco Canyon residents were jubilant Monday after the county
ordered grading halted at a youth detention camp after learning that
probation officials had bulldozed at least four acres of oaks and
coastal sage without state and federal permits.</LD>
<LD>   "We're very pleased," said Richard Gomez, a spokesman for the
Saddleback Canyons Conservancy. "The work order stopped the
destruction of the environment. But we don't know what will happen
next."</LD>
<LD>   County planners took action Friday on complaints by residents over
earth movers working at the Joplin Youth Center in Trabuco Canyon.</LD>
<TE>   Probation Department officials initially had said they had
sufficient permits from the county to grade a slope to reinforce a
sewage pond on the property.</TE>
<TE>   However, canyon residents insisted the area was potential habitat
for endangered or threatened species and that any construction or
grading would require permits from the state Department of Fish and
Game and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They also called in a
biologist to support their contention.</TE>
<TE>   "Once it was determined that the Probation Department did not have
state and federal permits, we issued a stop-work order," said Brian
Murphy, a planning services spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Biologist Robb Hamilton, who was hired by residents to survey the
area, said it contains coastal sage scrub, black and white sage, and
laurel sumac, among other vegetation important for local wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "I judged this habitat to be potentially suitable for nesting by
the federally threatened coastal California gnatcatcher," Hamilton
said.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, when such projects are planned in an environmentally
sensitive area, the wildlife service is called in, surveys are
conducted, and an assessment is completed before grading begins.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, said Ken Corey, the federal agency's division chief
for Orange and Los Angeles counties, "The habitat was cleared and we
didn't know anything about the area prior to the grading."</TE>
<TE>   Corey said that the habitat cleared by the county "was potentially
that of the threatened California gnatcatcher" and authorization was
needed before any work could proceed.</TE>
<TE>   Watchful residents were already fighting construction of the
Rancho Potrero Leadership Academy, a 90-bed coeducational facility
planned next to Joplin's 64-bed youth camp, and have been on the
lookout for any development in the area.</TE>
<TE>   When grading began April 16 at Joplin, residents complained to the
Probation Department. They were told that the department had been
issued a permit by county planning.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, residents insisted the grading was destroying oaks
and sensitive vegetation, but the work continued.</TE>
<TE>   The order to stop grading was issued eight days later by county
Planning and Development Services Department, planning spokesman
Murphy said. "We did have permits," he said, "but there was a
miscommunication between us and Probation."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives from the county will meet with state and federal
wildlife agencies to determine whether mitigation measures are
necessary and what steps, if any, should be taken.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon residents have sued the Probation Department, alleging that
the project violates state environmental guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The department denies the allegations, and insists that Joplin and
Juvenile Hall are overcrowded and won't meet the county's projected
need.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said canyon residents believe the grading wasn't really for
a sewage pond, but the beginning of construction for the academy--an
allegation that Probation Department officials denied.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said residents will remain vigilant.</TE>
<TE>   "A week ago they told us 'Everything's fine,'" he said. "But at
least they now know that when we find out something is going on out
there, we're not just crying wolf."</TE>

<HD>House Arrest for Rap Lawyer</HD>
<DH>Justice: Attorney for 'Suge' Knight of Death Row Records
didn't file a 1995 tax return. He has paid restitution, and must pay
court costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge sentenced the former attorney for rap impresario
Marion "Suge" Knight to three years of probation on a misdemeanor tax
charge stemming from a broad investigation into the alleged criminal
activities of Knight's music label, Death Row Records.</LD>
<LD>   Under the terms of a plea agreement, Encino lawyer David Kenner,
61, was ordered Monday by U.S. District Judge Florence-Marie Cooper
to spend nine months under house arrest for not filing a tax return
in 1995.</LD>
<LD>   Kenner, whose attorney said he is now bankrupt and has cancer, has
paid $20,000 in restitution and will be required to pay an additional
$1,500 in court costs.</LD>
<TE>   More than 50 of Kenner's colleagues wrote letters to the court on
his behalf. "I rarely get to read so many letters by people I know,"
Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Kenner's tax charge was the second criminal prosecution from a
federal racketeering probe of Death Row that began seven years ago by
the FBI, other federal agencies and the Los Angeles Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just glad this is over," Kenner said as he left the
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Following the killings of Death Row artist Tupac Shakur and Bad
Boy's Notorious B.I.G., federal authorities began investigating
accusations that Death Row and Knight were involved in murder, drug
trafficking, money laundering and gun running.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the Los Angeles-based gangsta rap label was also
charged with failing to file a 1995 federal tax return. No charges
have been filed against Knight.</TE>
<TE>   The tax charges aside, Knight, Kenner and the record company face
civil suits from former Death Row artists and employees for claims
ranging from fraud to failure to pay royalties.</TE>

<HD>Engineer Sentenced in Nuclear Trigger Case</HD>
<DH>Weapons: Richard Kelly Smyth, extradited from Spain,
admitted a 'grave error' in shipping to Israel devices that can fire
nuclear weapons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Southern California engineer who fled the country in 1985 after
being indicted on charges of selling Israel electronic devices that
can be used to fire nuclear weapons was sentenced Monday to 40 months
in federal prison.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Kelly Smyth, now 72 and in frail health, was discovered
living in southern Spain last year. He was arrested by local police
and extradited to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   He pleaded guilty in December to violating the U.S. Arms Export
Control Act and making a false statement about the contents of one
shipment of the devices, which are known as krytrons and have a
variety of applications, from triggering nuclear warheads to
operating photocopying machines.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the sentence, federal Judge Pamela A. Rymer ruled that
Smyth could immediately apply to be released on parole. She also
fined him $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli authorities denied having acquired the 2-inch-long
krytrons for their nuclear weapons arsenal. After Smyth's indictment,
they returned the remaining devices to U.S. authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing in Los Angeles federal court Monday, Smyth said he made
a "grave error" when he shipped about 800 krytrons in the early 1980s
to Heli Trading Co. in Israel without State Department approval.</TE>
<TE>   Heli Trading was owned at that time by Arnon Milchan, an
Israeli-born arms trader who later became a successful Hollywood film
producer. His movies have included "Pretty Woman" and "L.A.
Confidential."</TE>
<TE>   Milchan has denied involvement in the krytron deal. He told CBS'
"60 Minutes" two years ago that he had allowed the Israeli government
to use his company for trading with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In court, Smyth also apologized for fleeing the United States just
before the start of his scheduled 1985 trial before Rymer, now a
federal appeals court judge. He said he panicked after reading
newspaper articles saying he could be sentenced to up to 105 years in
prison if convicted on all of the 30 criminal counts originally
lodged against him.</TE>
<TE>   The 105 years represented the maximum sentence allowed by statute.
Statutory maximums are only rarely applied.</TE>
<TE>   Abandoning his engineering business, Milco International Inc., and
an expensive home in Orange County, Smyth and his wife, Emelie, flew
to Switzerland and then settled in Malaga, Spain, passing themselves
off as retirees.</TE>
<TE>   Smyth, using his real name, was vice president of the American
Club in Malaga. He and his wife got along on Social Security and
occasional gifts from relatives.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities learned of Smyth's whereabouts by accident. Last
year, he opened an account at a bank in Malaga, noting in his
application that he was a U.S. citizen. A routine check by the bank
with Interpol turned up an arrest warrant issued in Los Angeles.
Smyth was taken into custody by Spanish police.</TE>
<TE>   While in jail awaiting extradition, he suffered two strokes. His
lawyer, James D. Riddet, cited his client's medical condition and age
as he appealed to Rymer for leniency.</TE>
<TE>   Riddet asked the judge to follow the recommendation of the federal
probation office that Smyth be sentenced to 10 months in prison,
roughly the same amount of time he has spent behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   Smyth did not know that krytrons could be used as nuclear triggers
when he sold them to Israel, Riddet said. He described his client as
a patriotic American who had served his country loyally as a
technical advisor to the Air Force and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Smyth, he said, was a "brilliant scientist who was just not very
intelligent when it came to practical matters," such as obtaining a
government permit to sell the krytrons to a foreign buyer.</TE>
<TE>   But Assistant U.S. Atty. Daniel S. Goodman objected to the
portrayal of Smyth as "an absent-minded professor." He said Smyth
knew that krytron sales overseas were restricted. In the mid-1970s,
he noted, Smyth was denied a permit to ship them to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "If the defendant had gone to trial and been convicted in 1985, he
would have long since been released and returned to his family,"
Goodman said in a memo to the judge. "The fact that he now stands
before this court for sentencing at the age of 72 is not the fault of
the government."</TE>
<TE>   Goodman asked for a five-year sentence to show that "justice
cannot be turned into a game of hide and seek where the prize for the
elusive is the immunity of old age."</TE>
<TE>   In sentencing Smyth, Rymer said she found it difficult to accept
the notion that he was naive about the law. Observing that he and his
wife spent "15 idyllic years in Spain" after fleeing the United
States, she questioned why he made no effort to come back on his own
to face the music.</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Sued Over Molestation Cases</HD>
<DH>Litigation: The civil filings on behalf of two sets of
brothers accuse Mahony of running a criminal enterprise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Roger M. Mahony was sued Monday in Los Angeles County
Superior Court under a federal racketeering law typically used to
dismantle organized crime operations. Two lawsuits were filed on
behalf of two sets of brothers who allege they were sexually abused
as children by a priest in the Los Angeles Archdiocese.</LD>
<LD>   The civil lawsuits allege that Mahony protected abusive priests as
head of the archdiocese, a pattern of behavior that constitutes a
criminal enterprise.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuits also allege that the nation's 194 bishops maintain
secret files on abusive priests that should be turned over to
authorities.</LD>
<TE>   Specifically, the suit alleges, Mahony promised to remove Father
Carl Sutphin after learning of abuse allegations in the early 1990s,
but waited until this year to force Sutphin into retirement. The
lawsuits also allege that Mahony knew of other abusive priests but
did not fire them or report them to police.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence directly establishes that Cardinal Mahony as the
head of the church in Los Angeles has engaged in a pattern of
concealment, deception, obstruction of judicial process and the
protection of pedophile priests and he's been doing that for years,"
said Jeffrey R. Anderson, a St. Paul, Minn., attorney who has filed
numerous lawsuits against dioceses across the country since the
1980s. "The RICO [Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organizations]
laws are designed to get to the top of criminal organizations if they
[church officials] act like mobsters and organized crime, we just
have to hold them responsible."</TE>
<TE>   RICO was enacted three decades ago as a tool in the government's
war against organized crime and has since been used in civil cases.
Under the statute, racketeering is defined as a criminal enterprise
that affects interstate commerce and uses illegal means to further
its ends. In this case, Anderson alleges, the archdiocese concealed
abuses to maintain its reputation and keep getting church donations.</TE>
<TE>   The racketeering lawsuits are the first to name an American
cardinal, Anderson said at a news conference Monday. He spoke on the
downtown courthouse steps alongside two alleged victims and about a
dozen supporters, then walked two blocks to deliver the suit at the
new downtown cathedral. The victims are seeking unspecified
compensation, as well as policies to prevent priests from abusing
children. RICO suits pay triple damages.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocesan officials would not comment on the lawsuits. Mahony,
who was taken to a Burbank hospital Sunday night with blood clots in
his lung, is expected to be released in about a week.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said last week that he forced Sutphin to retire early after
reviewing past reports of sexual abuse by priests. Mahony said he
required Sutphin to undergo psychological counseling when he first
learned of the abuse allegations in the 1990s. He said he received
good reports about Sutphin's progress and later allowed him to live
at St. Vibiana's Cathedral with him and other priests. Mahony said he
thought Sutphin was well supervised there.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the plaintiffs took a different view.</TE>
<TE>   "Hasn't he heard of jail?" Anderson said. "I don't think he did
anything for the safety of children."</TE>
<TE>   The two lawsuits, one filed on behalf of twin brothers Andrew and
Joseph Cicchillo and the other on behalf of two unidentified victims,
allege that letters were sent to archdiocese officials in the 1990s
describing the allegations against Sutphin. The Times does not
identify sexual abuse victims unless they request that their names be
published</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Cicchillo said that he sent a letter to the cardinal in
1991, and that he was told in response that Sutphin would be removed
from the priesthood. He said he received money from the archdiocese
to pay for counseling. About a year later, Cicchillo's sister wrote
to Mahony requesting money for Andrew's continued therapy. That
request was apparently denied.</TE>
<TE>   Cicchillo, 46, said he was abused by Sutphin for 10 years,
beginning when he was about 6. Sutphin was the associate pastor at
St. Rose of Lima Church in Maywood at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Cicchillo said Sutphin would tell him, "I love you like a brother,
this is between us, no one has to know."</TE>
<TE>   His twin brother, Joseph, said he was abused by Sutphin over two
or three years. He said Sutphin would tell him "you're the chosen
one, you're special." When he rebuffed the priest, Joseph Cicchillo
said, Sutphin told him he would go to hell if he didn't oblige.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits maintain that Mahony has a history of protecting
abusive priests, including Father Oliver O'Grady in Stockton.
Anderson in 1988 won a $30-million jury verdict on behalf of two
brothers allegedly molested by the priest. The verdict was later
negotiated to $7 million. The suit alleged that Mahony had
transferred the priest from one parish to another after learning of
the abuse allegations. But Mahony testified in the trial that he was
unaware of certain allegations against O'Grady when he moved him.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits also claim that abuses by Father Santiago Tamayo, who
allegedly had sex with a 16-year-old girl from 1979 to 1982, were
concealed by the archdiocese to avoid liability. Tamayo, the suit
alleges, took the girl to the Philippines to hide her pregnancy. She
later sued the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's suit alleges that the archdiocesan attorneys in 1984 lied
when they claimed that they did not know where to find Tamayo.
Correspondence showed that the church was mailing him checks at an
address in the Philippines. Tamayo returned in 1988 to answer the
civil allegations.</TE>
<TE>   That year, Bishop Thomas J. Curry, who was the vicar in charge of
personnel at the L.A. archdiocese at the time, advised him to leave
the United States, that the payments were to help him live
permanently in the Philippines. A copy of the letter, the suit noted,
was sent to Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   In their lawsuit, two unidentified Ventura County brothers allege
that they were molested as youngsters in 1976 by Sutphin, when he was
chaplain at St. John's Medical Center in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers, identified only as John B. Doe and John F. Doe,
allege that they met Sutphin in 1975 when their family attended mass
at St. John's chapel.</TE>
<TE>   ''He became a family friend who came over to dinner," John F. Doe
said in an interview. ''This was a priest my parents trusted."</TE>
<TE>   He said he and his brother were abused by the priest on a fishing
trip.</TE>
<TE>   ''It was [Sutphin's] mom's trailer," John F. Doe said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he never told anyone about the alleged abuse until January
1994 when his brother told his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Their mother, a longtime Catholic high school teacher, reported
the abuse the next day to Msgr. Terrance Fleming, then vice
chancellor of the archdiocese, the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. Timothy J. Dyer, who supervised priests at the time, called
her back.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would take care of the problem, the lawsuit alleges.
Dyer has declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson wrote to Mahony on April 10, advising him of Sutphin's
alleged misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   He attached a letter from the mother of John F. Doe and John B.
Doe seeking an explanation from Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   John McNicholas, an archdiocese attorney, replied in an April 22
letter that Sutphin had been removed from the ministry. Mahony said
he turned over Sutphin's name to police.</TE>
<TE>   Several lawyers with experience in RICO lawsuits said the case
faces major obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea the church is running a pattern of racketeering
activity, it might make a good headline but it won't hold water at
the end of the day in court," said Los Angeles attorney Fred
Friedman.</TE>
<TE>   He said lawyers often prefer to file such cases in state court
because they tend to draw more sympathetic juries; verdicts do not
have to be unanimous.</TE>
<TE>   Other experts said the lawsuits may have been filed too late. RICO
has a four-year statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Michael J. Mueller, chairman of the American Bar Assn.'s Civil
RICO Committee, said the U.S. Supreme Court heard a RICO suit in
which an ex-patient sued physicians at a psychiatric hospital eight
years after his discharge.</TE>
<TE>   ''The Supreme Court said you cannot wait eight years after he
obviously knew to sue," Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   ''And so it seems to me a defendant in these type of cases is
going to point to that Supreme Court decision," Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said that besides the RICO allegations, the lawsuit also
claims battery, fraud, conspiracy, negligence and intentional
infliction of emotional distress.</TE>

<HD>Taxpayers May Be Getting Bad Advice</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge in Prop. 13 case is concerned that property
owners are told it's futile to challenge their assessment bills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County Superior Court judge who ruled last year that a
common method for assessing property taxes is unconstitutional
indicated Monday that he is worried government workers have been
wrongly advising taxpayers against filing for refunds.</LD>
<LD>   In a hearing, Judge John M. Watson agreed with attorneys
representing several county officials that, by law, the only remedy
for challenging a property assessment is to file for a refund. But if
people were told by government workers that doing so would be futile,
it would rob them of the only way to fight their tax bill, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The judge said he has seen no evidence of that happening but has
heard of taxpayers either calling government offices or logging onto
Web sites and being told, despite Watson's ruling, that the county's
assessment method is legal.</LD>
<TE>   "If these local officials being protective of their revenue flow
are giving or alleged to be giving false information [about refunds],
I would hardly find that an adequate remedy at law," Watson said. "In
fact, I find that no remedy at all."</TE>
<TE>   Watson found in December that an assessment method used by Orange
County Assessor Webster J. Guillory violated Proposition 13, the
landmark tax reform measure passed by California voters in 1978. He
ruled that Guillory illegally raised the assessed value of attorney
Robert Pool's Seal Beach home by more than the 2%-a-year limit set by
Proposition 13.</TE>
<TE>   County attorneys defended the practice, which has been used across
the state on properties that dropped in value and had their
assessments lowered. When the values rebound, the new assessments
routinely exceed the 2% limit--a method called recapturing.</TE>
<TE>   If Watson's ruling ultimately is upheld by a state appellate
court, it would affect every county in California. In Orange County,
taxing agencies would have to refund $285 million in excess property
taxes paid from 1998 to 2001, Orange County Auditor-Controller David
E. Sundstrom estimated. Statewide, the loss could go as high as $4
billion, he said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the ruling applies only to Pool and his wife, Renee
Bezaire, who sued over their 1998-99 tax bill. The value of the
couple's $330,000 home had stayed the same for a year, thanks to a
flat real estate market. But in 1998, the assessor decided that the
market had recovered and raised the home's taxable value to
$343,332--a 4% increase.</TE>
<TE>   The issue about what government workers might have told taxpayers
questioning their assessments is key in the ongoing case. If Watson
finds that the government interfered with the only way for taxpayers
to fight their assessments, he might be inclined to make his ruling
more sweeping.</TE>
<TE>   Pool wants Watson to issue an identical judgment on behalf of
everyone in Orange County whose assessments rose more than 2% a year.
Doing so would trigger a separate legal requirement that the county
tax collector notify those who overpaid property taxes by at least
$10 that they are due a refund. Those who filed for the refund would
then be sent a check.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors already have asked Guillory, Sundstrom
and Treasurer-Tax Collector John M.W. Moorlach--all elected
officials--to do just that. The three have declined, citing the
ongoing court case.</TE>
<TE>   Sundstrom said it could cost as much as $2 million to identify and
notify everyone in Orange County who overpaid their taxes under
Watson's ruling. Some 1,768 claims for refunds have been filed since
December, citing Watson's ruling, Pool said Monday. He estimated that
as many as 400,000 taxpayers may be affected.</TE>
<TE>   Watson also agreed Monday to reconsider a motion by Moorlach that
he hand the case to another judge, a motion he denied this month.
Moorlach wants another judge to rule on the case as a way of vetting
Watson's interpretation of the law before it is applied countywide.</TE>

<HD>Down Huntington Beach Alley, It's Beginning to Look a Lot
Like ... May Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The police log of the Huntington Beach Wave carried this alarming
item: "April 21, England Street, 1100 block, city ordinance
violation: Someone dumped a Christmas tree in an alley." Don't even
ask if he's taken down his outdoor Christmas lights yet.</LD>
<LD>   Claptrap and Clapsaddle: "L.A. Exposed," a new book by Paul Young,
explores some of the offbeat legends of the devilish City of Angels,
including these:</LD>
<LD>   * "A group of Hollywood actors stole John Barrymore's corpse from
a funeral parlor, set it up in a chair and threw a party in his
honor." (False, though Barrymore probably would have approved of the
idea.)</LD>
<TE>   "Fidel Castro appeared in numerous Hollywood movies before his
career as Cuba's communist dictator ... all with his Cuban
compatriot, bandleader Xavier Cugat." (Unlikely, unless Castro stuck
his face into a crowd scene in one of the movies filmed in Mexico
during his stay there.)</TE>
<TE>   * "The basement of Mann's Chinese Theater is full of footprints of
actors and actresses deemed 'not worthy enough' to be in front of the
theater." (False, though a theater spokesman admitted that the rumor
is so strong that Mann's occasionally receives phone calls from
people "planning to fly to L.A. for a vacation and they want to know
if they can get a tour to see the other footprints.")</TE>
<TE>   * "W.C. Fields used a fake name on his tombstone at Forest Lawn."
(False, including the rumor that he was buried under the name of a
real-life bank clerk whose name he admired: Mabel Clapsaddle.)</TE>
<TE>   And, oh yes, his marker does not say he'd rather be in
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. legends (cont.): Oddly enough, Young's book contains a
snapshot of a star-struck intersection in Beverly Hills (see photo).
But the book doesn't discuss two legends that it has spawned.</TE>
<TE>   One is that the street corner was named after the star of "To Kill
a Mockingbird" and other movies (false; it bears the last names of
two early residents).</TE>
<TE>   And, second, that the actor took his name from the intersection
upon arriving in L.A. (also false; he was born Gregory Peck).</TE>
<TE>   Low finance: Michael Devine of Hollywood says he's heard of people
getting in their two cents, but figures his landlord must have been
affected by inflation (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Low finance (II): When Drusilla Khan of Culver City saw an odd
statement on Wells Fargo Online (see accompanying), she quipped,
"Fortunately, I can't see how much I'm overdrawn."</TE>
<TE>   Two Kobes are better than one? ESPN radio surveyed listeners about
"the most annoying things in sports," and one complaint involved
adults who wear facsimile uniforms of athletes they don't resemble.</TE>
<TE>   Said one anguished fan: "The other day at a mall, I saw a
350-pound guy in a Kobe Bryant jersey."</TE>
<TE>   That's why I played it safe. I plan to gradually fill out my Shaq
jersey over the years.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Bruce Phillips sent along an item making the rounds of
the Internet: a photo of a toaster that someone was trying to sell on
eBay. What stands out in the photo, which we can't show you, is the
reflection of the person snapping the shot. He has no clothes on.
And, as for his body ... let's just say he could be the guy in the
Kobe jersey.</TE>

<HD>Chocolate Bunny Survived but 'Wiccagate' Probe Still Urged</HD>
<DH>Tolerance: Pagans say their harmless ritual was interrupted
by Christians who were motivated by hate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the shivery evening of the spring equinox, 50 hooded pagans formed
a circle in the parking lot behind the Witches Grove gift store in
downtown Lancaster. After praying to their gods, they prepared a
ritual sacrifice: a white chocolate bunny destined for a fondue pot.</LD>
<LD>   A desert wind killed the Sterno cans, and the tongue-in-cheek
offering was spared. By then, about 20 Christians had driven up to
pray for the pagans' souls, and two were walking around the circle
reading Bible verses. The tone of the evening suddenly shifted.</LD>
<LD>   Words were exchanged. A praying man, who turned out to be a
sheriff's chaplain, was blaring Christian pop tunes through his SUV
speakers. "Forgive them, Lord," he said. "They don't know what
they're doing."</LD>
<TE>   The pagans said they felt intimidated and called the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department. Although the Lancaster station is three
blocks away, it took deputies 4 1/2 hours to respond. By the time
they arrived, everyone was gone.</TE>
<TE>   The events of the evening of March 16--since dubbed "Wiccagate" by
the local media--have ignited an intense debate among residents over
1st Amendment rights, hate legislation and the limits of tolerance in
the High Desert, a bastion of Christian conservatism that is
grappling with growing racial and religious diversity.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the pagans call the interruption of their services a hate
crime. But Lancaster Sheriff's Capt. Tom Pigott said no one was
assaulted, no property was damaged and no laws were broken.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, county Supervisor Mike Antonovich has asked the
Sheriff's Department to explain why deputies took so long to respond,
and the Antelope Valley Interfaith Council has scheduled a day of
prayer May 19 in response to the night's events.</TE>
<TE>   "What technically happened was not a crime, but a great deal of
hatred motivated the action," said council President Bishop Bernard
Price, whose Church of St. Thomas is part of the Syrian Orthodox
Church of Antioch. "The Christians accused [the pagans] of being
Satanists, and [the pagans] don't believe in that. It's only the
religious right that believes in Satan."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Christians who were in the parking lot that night are
unrepentant and are worried that the 2-year-old shop in the heart of
downtown Lancaster is an outpost of satanic activity. Yet for many
residents, the incident is little more than an embarrassing public
relations gaffe for the Antelope Valley.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, valley leaders have founded a number of
politically correct institutions to combat the area's reputation for
narrow-mindedness, including a hate crimes hotline, a human relations
task force and an anger management course for teens drawn to bigotry.</TE>
<TE>   This year, thousands of students created a giant human peace
symbol for the third annual "Increase the Peace" day, in which
speakers took up themes of harmony and tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   Pastor Tom Pickens, president of the Antelope Valley Christian
Ministers Assn., said events such as interfaith prayer services held
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks better reflect the valley's
religious attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's somewhat unfortunate that this incident has been
blown out of proportion," Pickens said.</TE>
<TE>   Cyndia Riker, owner of the Lancaster store catering to witches and
warlocks, disagrees. The mother of three calls her religion,
paganism, an Earth-centered form of worship with a history that
predates Christianity. Paganism and a popular subset of the religion,
Wicca, have nothing to do with Satanism, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Riker, who has owned the shop since September, believes the
delayed response by authorities was the result of a close
relationship between the department and some of the protesters. She
said that Pastor Billy Pricer was among the Christians present that
night.</TE>
<TE>   Pricer, a former sheriff's deputy, is head chaplain at the station
and works closely with local deputies through UCAN, his counseling
program for at-risk youth. The man blaring his stereo was Pricer's
son-in-law, John Canavello, then associate chaplain at the Lancaster
sheriff's station, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the pagans say Canavello flashed his sheriff's
identification card that night and told the pagans their calls to the
station would be ignored. Canavello denies the allegations, but said
his ID was on his dashboard.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Pigott denies any conspiracy. He said his deputies did not
know Pricer and Canavello were at the ceremony and they were
overburdened that night.</TE>
<TE>   Lancaster dispatchers received a call about a religious observance
being disturbed about 4 p.m., but deputies recognized the address as
a business and logged it as a loud music complaint, he said. With 76
other calls that night, deputies had to prioritize and could not get
to the shopping center until 8 p.m., well after the incident was
over.</TE>
<TE>   The incident was reviewed by hate crimes specialists from the
Sheriff's Department and the district and city attorney's offices.
They all determined that no laws were broken, said Sgt. Katherine
Voyer, who heads the sheriff's hate crimes task force.</TE>
<TE>   They also declined to categorize it as a "hate incident," because
no derogatory words were used, Voyer said.</TE>
<TE>   But Riker and other pagans said they are dismayed by what they see
as weaknesses in anti-hate laws that let the Christians off the hook.
The California penal code makes it a misdemeanor to disturb a
religious event with "rude or indecent behavior, or by any
unnecessary noise," but the law applies only to ceremonies that take
place in tax-exempt buildings. The code states that making threats
against religious practitioners is a felony, but sheriff's officials
determined that no threats were made.</TE>
<TE>   Riker said her group will begin lobbying officials to change the
laws. While Canavello has been suspended as a sheriff's chaplain for
his involvement in the incident, Riker said she also would like the
Sheriff's Department to cut its ties to Pricer.</TE>
<TE>   Known around the valley for his far-right activism, Pricer was
once a minister at Lancaster's Springs of Life ministries, which
distributed a controversial anti-homosexual video in the 1990s titled
"The Gay Agenda." He said he attended the ceremony after hearing a
rumor that the pagans would be "claiming the valley for Satan." With
all the concern over pagans' rights, people have lost sight of
Christians' legal prerogative to evangelize and speak their minds, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly we should be tolerant of individual rights," he said.
"But where's the tolerance of our 1st Amendment rights? I still

<HD>High Court Turns Down Quake Insurance Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SAVAGE and KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned away the insurance industry's
challenge of a California law that gave thousands of property owners
a second chance to claim damages from the 1994 Northridge earthquake.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, we're disappointed," said Fiona Hutton, a consultant
with 21st Century Insurance Co., formerly known as 20th Century,
which asked the high court to hear a case involving a Culver City
homeowner. The court refused the request without comment.</LD>
<LD>   Under most homeowners' insurance policies, policyholders had just
one year to file quake-related claims. But years after the deadline,
some homeowners discovered serious structural cracks or other damage
that might have been caused by the magnitude 6.7 temblor.</LD>
<TE>   Insurance companies told policyholders it was too late to file
claims, even if an adjuster had examined their homes in 1994 and
assured them that no quake damage had occurred. In response, the
Legislature passed a measure that gave those policyholders one more
year to file claims after finding damage. This second-chance option
expired at the end of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 lawsuits were filed in Los Angeles Superior Court
that contained new claims of quake damage. It could not be determined
Monday how many claims remain unresolved. The lawsuits were brought
against numerous insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   Hutton said 21st Century had set aside $70 million to pay late
claims, some of which have been settled.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowner Linda Ahles, whose case was the basis of the Supreme
Court appeal, filed a new quake claim after a termite inspector found
severe damage in the crawl space of her Culver City house. In July
1994, an engineer sent by 20th Century had inspected and reported
minimal damage.</TE>
<TE>   When Ahles brought her claim in L.A. Superior Court, the insurance
company said it should be dismissed. But it lost in that court and in
the state Court of Appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Last October, the California Supreme Court refused to hear the
insurance industry's challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Ahles and her attorney could not be reached Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica attorney Gary Paul, who represented about 30
homeowners in quake-related disputes with several insurers, said he
was surprised that 21st Century challenged the law. He said most
states allow policyholders more than a year to file claims for
property damage. "Extending the deadline for filing a claim was the
only reasonable thing to do," Paul said.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers say they paid about 600,000 claims totaling $15.3 billion
as a result of the Northridge quake. More than $1 billion in claims
was processed by 21st Century, Hutton said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In their appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, 21st Century lawyers
called the state waiver law an unconstitutional, retroactive changing
of a contract. They said companies should not be forced to pay
belated claims.</TE>
<TE>   "This retroactive legislation, by dramatically upsetting settled
expectations, is a wholesale assault on economic rights," said David
S. Ettinger, an Encino lawyer who helped represent 21st Century.</TE>
<TE>   But lawyers representing policyholders said the insurers
exaggerated the effect of the law. Moreover, the Supreme Court for
more than 200 years has said the ban on retroactive statutes applies
only to criminal laws, not civil measures like the insurance
regulation.</TE>

<HD>Laguna's on Playground Razor Blade Alert</HD>
<DH>Crime: Sunday discovery in one park after a phone tip has
sparked inspections citywide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laguna Beach has stepped up daily inspections of city playgrounds
after the unsettling weekend discovery of 18 razor blades believed to
have been placed to harm children in a Main Beach playground.</LD>
<LD>   "It's alarming," Councilwoman Cheryl Kinsman said Monday. "I'm
glad they were found before someone got hurt."</LD>
<LD>   To prevent injuries, she said, city maintenance workers and
police--who already visit municipal parks daily--are being asked to
look for razors and other dangerous items and, in some cases,
increase the frequency of inspections. "We've already combed the
other parks and found nothing," Kinsman said. "There is only so much
we can do--we're really [angry]."</LD>
<TE>   The razor blades were discovered early Sunday after a young woman
anonymously called police about 4 a.m., warning that some of her
friends -- eight males and possibly a female--were going to Main
Beach to do something that would injure people. Police dispatched to
the area saw nothing amiss, said Sgt. Jason Kravetz, a spokesman for
the Laguna Beach Police Department. But a resident arriving at the
playground a few hours later found the blades and called police.</TE>
<TE>   "They were placed in very deliberate positions," Kravetz said
Monday. "They were in the sand with the blades facing up so that when
the kids came down the slide they would land on them. They were also
underneath the swing set so that kids with no shoes would step on
them. And they were at the top rung of the ladder, obviously to
injure children."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are talking to police in Costa Mesa and Newport
Beach to determine whether the latest crime might be tied to a rash
of similar ones in those cities last year, Kravetz said. In April and
May 2001, he said, razor blades were found on or around swings,
sandboxes and slides at Heller, Pinkley and Lions parks in Costa
Mesa, and at Bolsa and Marina parks in Newport Beach. In October,
three more blades were found at Heller Park.</TE>
<TE>   No injuries were reported and no one was ever arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Police are also asking for the public's help in identifying the
early-morning tipster. "If anyone knows who called," Kravetz said,
"or if the caller herself reads the paper, we'd like her to call us
back."</TE>
<TE>   The woman did not dial 911, Kravetz said, and could not be
identified through caller ID. If her identity is not quickly learned,
he said, police may release a tape of her call to the news media.
"Perhaps someone will recognize her voice and contact us."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Parish's 1-2 Scandal Punch</HD>
<DH>Religion: A molestation report ousts a priest where the
pastor had already lost his job in another sex abuse case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parishioners at St. Edward Church, already stunned by allegations
that their former pastor impregnated a teenage girl and paid for her
abortion 20 years ago, received another shock over the weekend when a
second priest was removed from the Dana Point parish over accusations
of sex abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Father Denis Lyons, who was two months' shy of retirement, was
placed on paid administrative leave Friday after accusations were
made last week that he had molested a young teenage boy two decades
ago.</LD>
<LD>   The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange forwarded the information to
the Costa Mesa police and provided no other information on the case
publicly.</LD>
<TE>   Lyons, 68, couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Diocesan officials also disclosed that Lyons had admitted in 1993
to "inappropriate behavior" with two men while serving as pastor of
St. John the Baptist in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1994, the parents of two brothers complained to the
diocese that Lyons had molested their sons, who were 14 and 16 at the
time, around 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Both times, church officials said, they sent Lyons for "extensive
counseling," including an eight-month stay at an out-of-state
treatment center after the second set of allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Lyons didn't qualify under the diocese's new "one strike" policy
for removing priestly sex offenders because the allegations involving
the two brothers couldn't be proved, a church official said.</TE>
<TE>   "We did review the file" previously, said spokeswoman Maria
Schinderle. But because there was not enough evidence that Lyons had
engaged in child molestation, "it was felt he was not a risk to
minors."</TE>
<TE>   Schinderle said Lyons showed excellent results in psychological
evaluations, which contributed to the decision to keep him in
ministry. The priest had been at St. Edward since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Lyons is the fifth priest in the Orange diocese removed from
parishes in recent months. Father John Lenihan was ousted as pastor
of St. Edward in September after admitting to have "numerous" sexual
relationships with women. He had previously admitted to molesting a
teenage girl in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   In December, another woman, Lori Haigh, accused Lenihan in a
lawsuit of impregnating her 20 years ago when she was a teenager and
paying for her abortion. The dioceses of Orange and Los Angeles
settled the case earlier this month for $1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in San Bernardino, one Roman Catholic priest has
resigned and another has been placed on a leave of absence after that
diocese recently revealed allegations they had abused children.</TE>
<TE>   Parishioners were told of the allegations and the diocese's
response in weekend Masses.</TE>
<TE>   Father Peter Covas, 70, of St. Peter and St. Paul Catholic Church
in Rancho Cucamonga resigned Friday, also two months before his
planned retirement, said Father Howard Lincoln, a spokesman for the
San Bernardino diocese.</TE>
<TE>   And the San Bernardino bishop, Gerald Barnes, placed Msgr. Peter
Luque of St. Edward parish in on indefinite leave. One complaint has
been made against each priest, Lincoln said.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations in that diocese surfaced last week after a panel
of priests and lay people reviewed about 400 files on priests going
back 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes formed the panel in response to the sex abuse scandal that
has shaken the Roman Catholic Church nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the diocese turned over 22 allegations against 20
priests to San Bernardino police. The first offense is alleged to
have occurred in 1957, the most recent in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 20 priests, four have died, one left the country and 11 are
retired or no longer work in the diocese.</TE>
<TE>   The four remaining priests were still in active ministry as of
Friday. Two of those are retired, so-called supply priests who fill
in at parishes when needed. Lincoln would not name them. The other
two are Luque and Covas.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln declined to address the nature of the allegations against
those two priests, though he did say they go back "several years,"
before both joined their most recent parishes.</TE>
<TE>   "There are children at [the most recent] parishes, and we have had
absolutely no report whatsoever of any inappropriate conduct,"
Lincoln said.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino Police Lt. Frank Mankin said most of the alleged
offenses were in San Bernardino and Riverside counties but some were
in Los Angeles and San Diego counties. And "there were some
allegations that were reported to have taken place in Missouri,
Indiana and Massachusetts," he added.</TE>

<HD>Dodger Great's Ring Recovered at Pawnshop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police have recovered Jackie Robinson's National League
championship ring, which was stolen last year from a relative of the
Dodger baseball great, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Miguel Rodriguez, 21, of Los Angeles was booked on suspicion of
grand theft after the owner of a pawnshop recognized the ring, which
had been pawned for $100, said Officer Jack Richter, a spokesman for
the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a historic item given to one of the greatest baseball
players to ever play the game," Richter said. "But you can't put a
price on it. It's invaluable."</LD>
<TE>   Robinson, who broke baseball's color barrier in 1947 and starred
for the Dodgers, received the ring when the then-Brooklyn Dodgers won
the 1953 National League championship.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Robinson's brother-in-law, who had inherited the ring,
reported that it had been stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Rodriguez, who did odd jobs for the brother-in-law,
pawned the ring at Steve's Pawn Shop on Western Avenue in Los
Angeles. The owner noticed it among high school class rings and
called the LAPD's pawnshop detail.</TE>
<TE>   Pawnshop detectives are responsible for monitoring the activities
of more than 100 pawnshops in the city, Richter said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he said, the unit has recovered several stolen
World Series rings, a $100,000 powerboat and a Stradivarius violin.</TE>

<HD>Lawyers Spar Over Salgado's Role in Killing</HD>
<DH>Court: Prosecutor says the last defendant in 1999 Zara
slaying is guilty. Defense says he was set up and tricked.</DH>

<LD>Prosecutors in the trial of Ramiro Salgado asked jurors Monday to
convict the 22-year-old Ventura man of second-degree murder for his
alleged role in the stabbing, kicking and bludgeoning death of a man
the attackers thought had called the police on a noisy party.</LD>
<LD>   In closing arguments, Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox said Salgado,
the fifth and final defendant in the 1999 slaying, was a member of a
west Ventura gang and told police he stomped and kicked William Zara,
18. The victim was also stabbed repeatedly and hit with a shovel and
a baseball bat as he tried to crawl away.</LD>
<LD>   The defense countered that Salgado had been misled by police,
wrongly fingered by a lying witness eager to save his own skin and
irresponsibly labeled a gang member by lazy law enforcement
officials.</LD>
<TE>   Fox showed color photographs of the party on East Warner Avenue in
Ventura before it went terribly wrong the night of Sept. 25. Gang
members are shown drinking and making gang signs. At some point, a
neighbor telephoned police to complain about the noise. After police
left, a group of gang members went out to find the person who called.</TE>
<TE>   They beat several people on the street and found their way to
Zara's home, wanting to teach a lesson in fear and intimidation, Fox
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a street gang; it's not a car club or shopping club," the
prosecutor said. "They are a gang of thugs. Their main point is to
instill fear."</TE>
<TE>   About 10 men converged on Zara, who tried to fend them off with a
baseball bat. One attacker hit Zara in the head with a shovel while
another grabbed the bat and beat him with it. After he fell to his
knees, others began kicking and punching him. Zara died the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said Salgado's statements to police placed him at the center
of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "He tells the cops that he's standing right beside the guy with
the shovel," Fox said. "He says he saw Matt Lohse on the roof
throwing rocks at the crowd. This was a detail you wouldn't know
unless you were at the scene."</TE>
<TE>   Lohse, who lived nearby, was beaten by one of the gang members and
later tried to get the attackers off Zara by pelting them with rocks
from the roof.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado, who faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted, told
police he had kicked Zara twice in the back. "I stomped him. I'll
take the blame for that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Gonzales, another alleged gang member, who agreed to testify
in exchange for immunity from prosecution, said Salgado also hit Zara
with the shovel.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Salgado admitted to punching and kicking Billy Zara when he
was on his knees surrounded by 10 other people," Fox said. "You don't
have to be the person who struck the death blow to be guilty of
murder."</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorney Richard Loftus spent half a day detailing why
Salgado should go free. According to the coroner, he said, Zara had
been hit four to six times in the head. Loftus said Benny Lopez Jr.,
18, hit the victim three times with a bat and Frank Olvera hit Zara
three times with a shovel.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez was sentenced to 32 years to life in prison last year.
Olvera, 34, his wife, Rosana Olvera, 37, and Terry Schell, 23, were
sentenced to 15 years each for conspiracy and second-degree murder
last August.</TE>
<TE>   "Where are all the blows from Mr. Salgado?" Loftus asked.</TE>
<TE>   He called Gonzales a habitual liar who turned in Salgado precisely
because Salgado wasn't a hard-core gang member who could retaliate
against him.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris Gonzales said he would do whatever he could to talk his way
out of it," Loftus said. "Well, he did."</TE>
<TE>   Loftus acknowledged that Salgado was a former gang member, but
said police insisted on saying his client was still in a gang without
any evidence. He said all the photos shown at the party of gang
members left out one thing--Ramiro Salgado.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't there," Loftus said.</TE>
<TE>   Police deceived Salgado, telling him they only wanted the people
who used the shovel, bat and knife in the crime, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado believed he could go home if he simply said he kicked
Zara, not realizing he was buying himself a murder charge, Loftus
told jurors.</TE>
<TE>   "They said ... they weren't interested in the other people," he
said. "Officers are trained to get a confession. Mr. Salgado is not
well educated and he ends up in a den of officers who control
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Closing arguments are scheduled to continue this morning, and the
case should be given to the jury by day's end.</TE>

<HD>Deputy Killed in Irwindale Traffic Stop</HD>
<DH>Violence: David March is shot to death by driver who flees.
Authorities tracking the car's license plate arrest a man, but say
he's not the assailant.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A sheriff's deputy was shot to death Monday by a man he stopped for a
traffic violation in Irwindale, investigators said.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy David March, 33, a seven-year veteran of the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department who lived with his wife and stepdaughter
in Santa Clarita, was pronounced dead at Huntington Memorial Hospital
in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators said the man who shot him fled in a dirty black 1989
Nissan sedan. The killer, who remained at large Monday night, was
described as Latino, in his 20s, about 5-foot-7, with short hair and
a mustache. The California license number of the car is 4BCZ512.</LD>
<TE>   The license plate led police to another man, who was arrested at
an apartment complex in Duarte a few hours after the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies said that the man's connection with the shooting, if any,
was not clear, but that they did not think he was the gunman.</TE>
<TE>   March, who was assigned to the Temple City station, was on routine
patrol in the Monrovia area about 10:30 a.m. when he began following
the car, which may have contained as many as three people, for an
undisclosed traffic violation, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   After March pulled the car over on Live Oak Avenue just east of
Peck Road, the driver got out, Deputy Rich Pena said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver "met the deputy halfway between the patrol car and
[his] vehicle," Pena said. "A confrontation ensued." The driver drew
a gun, fired and fled.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives said March was shot several times.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Watkins, 49, an engineer at the Sprague Ready Mix concrete
plant across the street, said he heard five shots. He dashed to Live
Oak to find March sprawled on the pavement, his head resting against
the curb.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of blood," Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins said a truck driver at the plant ran to the patrol car,
grabbed the radio microphone and broadcast: "A deputy's been shot!"</TE>
<TE>   Patrol cars responded quickly, Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the arriving officers gave March mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation, he said, but it was no use.</TE>
<TE>   The officer was so frustrated "that he got up and kicked his car,"
Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   On the tidy cul-de-sac of recently built homes where March lived
with his wife and her 13-year-old daughter, neighbors said they had
felt more secure because he lived there.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved his work, said Judy Miller, who lives across the street
with her husband. "He wouldn't have done anything else."</TE>
<TE>   "He got along with everybody," said Johnny Borrelli, 17. "But he
must have been a hard-working guy, because we never saw much of him."</TE>
<TE>   The mood was somber Monday afternoon at the Temple City station.
Deputies talked quietly among themselves, and some wiped away tears.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Sonia Parra said that March, who had married recently, "was
an outstanding deputy."</TE>
<TE>   Deputies always go to work knowing the risks. "I'm sure he had
plans for tonight," she said.</TE>

<HD>Firms Upbeat About Future</HD>
<DH>Survey: Employer confidence in the county's business
climate is up, and some executives expect to see new hiring this
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a gloomy 2001, Ventura County employers are sounding an upbeat
chord and increasingly planning to hire new workers, according to a
study released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   UC Santa Barbara's quarterly survey of employer confidence found
that officials at about half of 88 responding businesses thought
their firms were better off during the first three months of 2002
than a year before. Only one-quarter thought they were worse off.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 60% of respondents said the next six months will bring
still better news, while about 10% thought things would get worse.</LD>
<TE>   Across the board, employer attitudes have not rated so high since
late 2000, when the 1990s boom crashed into the recession of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big swing up--much more positive than we've seen
nationwide," said Bill Watkins, director of UCSB's Economic Forecast
Project. "And it's a pretty dramatic reversal from the fourth quarter
of last year."</TE>
<TE>   Local employers staggered in 2001 even before the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11, and finally cut jobs late in the year for the
first time since 1996. But recent employment figures have shown the
steady rebound reflected in the UCSB survey.</TE>
<TE>   The county's jobless rate dropped to 4.6% in March. Jobs were up
3,200 compared with a year before.</TE>
<TE>   "The firms are saying the bottom has passed," Watkins said. "It
occurred in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Now they're
pretty positive, and some of these results rank right up there with
those in the boom year of 2000."</TE>
<TE>   For example, nearly two-thirds of responding firms thought they
would see improved conditions in the local economy by summer and two
in five thought the economy would support new hires during the next
year.</TE>
<TE>   Both figures were the highest since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Executives were more cautious about their own hiring practices.</TE>
<TE>   About one-third said they would expand over the next year, while
62% said they expected to remain the same size. Few expected to
downsize.</TE>
<TE>   "Hiring more employees is a big commitment for a businessman,"
Watkins said. "But they've gone from thinking employment was going to
decrease to thinking it's going to increase."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, before the recent survey, respondents had said jobs would
decline for eight straight quarters, Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, they say the future is bright.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone tends to think that over the next five years we're going
to be all right," Watkins said. "You've got to have hope, right?"</TE>
<TE>   Results from businesses in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo
counties were similar to Ventura County's, Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Central Coast fared much better than the state and
nation during last year's recession and even outperformed bigger
regions in a healthy Southern California, Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   The local economy is riding out the downturn relatively well
because heavy manufacturing and Internet businesses, the nation's
weakest sectors, are not big employers in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   UCSB has conducted its Business Sentiment Survey each quarter for
about a decade.</TE>

<LD>A Glendale man serving a 65-year federal prison term was sentenced to
an extra nine years behind bars Monday for his role in a
murder-for-hire plot.</LD>
<LD>   Garen Zakarian, 38, and his brother, Archak, 33, pleaded guilty
last year in Los Angeles federal court to soliciting an FBI informant
to kill Artur Simonian, 37.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said the brothers feared that Simonian might upset
their plans to concoct a bogus alibi enabling Garen Zakarian to win a
new trial in the 1994 robbery-murder of a Glendale travel agent.</LD>
<TE>   The alibi witness was to have been Simonian's estranged wife,
Kristine Arutunyan, 32, who was having an affair with Archak
Zakarian.</TE>

<HD>Details of Sept. 11 Plot Elude U.S. Investigators</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: The hijackers concealed their scheme expertly,
which raises concerns about how to thwart an attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For more than seven months, U.S. authorities probing the Sept. 11
attacks have scoured everything from caves to credit cards in the
expectation that they would ultimately discover how the 19 hijackers
plotted their brazen scheme.</LD>
<LD>   But the global search has produced virtually nothing in the way of
hard evidence about the terrorists' planning, and authorities said
Monday that they face the growing realization that they may never
know many key details.</LD>
<LD>   That sobering conclusion underscores the skill and sophistication
of the Al Qaeda terrorist network in its ability to conceal its
activities--and the equally daunting difficulties that authorities
face in heading off another attack, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The hijackers "left no paper trail," FBI Director Robert Mueller
said in the text of a speech that the FBI released Monday. "In our
investigation, we have not uncovered a single piece of paper--either
here in the United States or in the treasure trove of information
that has turned up in Afghanistan and elsewhere--that mentioned any
aspect of the Sept. 11 plot."</TE>
<TE>   His remarks offer the FBI's most comprehensive and detailed
assessment to date of its investigation, remarkable as much for what
investigators have not found as for what they have.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller revealed that investigators believe the Sept. 11 plan may
have been in the works for as long as five years, and that the
hijackers used "meticulous planning, extraordinary secrecy and
extensive knowledge of how America works" to conceal their scheme
after entering the United States legally from the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have found no computers, laptops, hard drives or
other storage media that may have been used by the hijackers, who hid
their communications by using hundreds of pay phones and cell phones,
coupled with hard-to-trace prepaid calling cards.</TE>
<TE>   In executing wire transfers to fund the attacks, they were also
careful to send money in small amounts, avoiding large cash
transactions that would have triggered a government report, Mueller
said, adding: "The hijackers did all they could to stay below our
radar."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies have come under
intense scrutiny since Sept. 11, and some analysts suggested that
Mueller's comments, made in a speech to the Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco on April 19, may reflect an attempt to rationalize the
intelligence community's failure to pick up on any signs that an
attack was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, several episodes conceivably could have alerted
authorities to a possible plot, including indicted Al Qaeda member
Zacarias Moussaoui's suspicious activities at a Minnesota flight
school and the entry of two of the hijackers into the country even
though they were on a CIA terrorist "watch list."</TE>
<TE>   But even now, law enforcement officials say that while they have
been able to reconstruct the movements of the hijackers in the months
before the attacks--all legal except for a few speeding tickets--they
have found no evidence of their plotting.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been able to glean quite a bit in tracking their movements,
but as far as being able to identify a blueprint, some type of master
plan that was shared with a number of people outlining just how they
were going to pull this off, that's something we've not been able to
uncover," said an FBI official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the White House is deeply concerned about the lack of any
evidence that could have foreshadowed the events of Sept. 11. That is
one reason why U.S. counter-terrorism authorities intend to keep the
nation on an indefinite state of heightened alert, according to a
Bush administration official who also asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The paucity of information "confirms what we have thought for a
long time. If there was any doubt about the professionalism of the
hijackers, the [FBI] director's quotes should dispel that," the
official said. "If it took . . . years to develop the 9/11 plot, then
it is very, very possible that we are in a similar period right now,
where individuals are practicing the same type of operational
security in preparation for another attack."</TE>
<TE>   Even Mueller's assessment that the Sept. 11 attacks were in the
works for five years is largely "a supposition" based on somewhat
vague intelligence culled from tracking European terrorism suspects,
according to a law enforcement official. "There was never even
anything saying, 'Something is planned in the United States,' " the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   In a slew of attacks in Europe, Africa and the United States
during the 1990s that were linked to Al Qaeda and its leader, Osama
bin Laden, evidence inevitably would turn up after the fact revealing
how the plans were laid, said terrorism expert Daniel Benjamin, a
National Security Council aide in the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   But Mueller's assessment about the Sept. 11 plot "deepens the
sense that these guys [in Al Qaeda] have really taken a quantum leap
in their ability to carry out an operation without all the
traditional accouterments," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the hijackers never maintained a paper trail or managed to
destroy the evidence before the attacks, Benjamin said, "it's
incredibly scary. It's premature to declare the record closed, and
there may be something else out there that hasn't come out yet, but
the fact that nothing has turned up is an indication of just what a
skillful operation this was."</TE>
<TE>   William Wechsler, a former National Security Council official who
specialized in Al Qaeda financing, agreed that the Sept. 11 hijackers
managed to avoid basic missteps that had flawed earlier operations.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows we can't rely on the incompetence of terrorists to
protect us" anymore, Wechsler said. "The level of sophistication that
they have shown in their ability to hide for so long among us . . .
should make every American concerned that they could be doing the
very same thing today."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Mueller acknowledged the tremendous challenges that U.S.
law enforcement faces in heading off another attack. In his remarks,
he said the nation has not done enough to stop it.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorists have shown they are willing to go to great lengths to
destroy America," he said. "We must be willing to go to even greater
lengths to stop them. Our worldwide network must be more powerful.
Our financial commitment must be stronger. Our techniques and
training must be more sophisticated. And our sense of urgency and
intensity must be greater."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller said the FBI was doubling the number of agents working on
terrorism prevention--a commitment that goes beyond his previous
pledges. And the bureau is hoping to speed its terrorist information
flow by putting in a new computer system next year--replacing a
network that he said is "piecemeal and patchwork."</TE>
<TE>   Shutting down the terrorists' money pipelines is another priority,
Mueller said. Problems in this area have surfaced in the last few
months involving poor coordination among federal agencies and
questionable evidence against targeted Islamic groups, but Mueller
said the FBI has managed to review 75,000 transactions and help
freeze millions of dollars in terrorist money worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities at the Treasury Department, which is also
investigating terrorist money ties, are concerned about the new
evidence regarding Al Qaeda's ability to hide its financial tracks,
department spokesman Rob Nichols said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear the Al Qaeda use extremely clever and crafty ways to
move around, access and hide their money," Nichols said. "This fact
underscores the importance of choking off funds that enable terrorist
organizations to thrive and to identify on an ongoing basis suspected
financial intermediaries of global terror."</TE>

<LD>A former postal worker who spent 10 years in prison walked out of a

death row.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a bad dream that has come to an end," said Krone, who had
been dubbed the "Snaggletooth Murderer" because of a bite mark.
"We're all very thankful. . . . It's a good day and life's going to

<HD>Ex-President of Sotheby's Gets Probation</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: She is also fined $350,000. She colluded with
rival Christie's to fix commissions, restraining competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Monday sentenced Diana D. Brooks, the former
president of Sotheby's, to three years' probation for her role in a
scheme setting identical commissions with auction rival Christie's.</LD>
<LD>   Brooks' probation includes six months of home confinement. She
also was ordered to pay a fine of $350,000 and serve 1,000 hours of
community service.</LD>
<LD>   The collusion stifled competition between the world's two biggest
auction houses, violated antitrust laws and cost customers seeking to
sell goods worth millions of dollars.</LD>
<TE>   "Your circumstances evoke little compassion," U.S. District Judge
George B. Daniels told Brooks. "You substituted shame for fame.</TE>
<TE>   "Your words are the all-too-familiar refrain of the white-collar
criminal ... the extent of the damage you caused cannot be undone,"
he added.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks, whose position made her one of the most powerful people in
the art world until her resignation from Sotheby's in 2000, told the
court before sentencing that she was sorry.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to apologize to all the people I have hurt," she
said in a shaky voice. "I accept responsibility for what I've done
... I will forever bear the burden of what I have done."</TE>
<TE>   In December, Daniels sentenced former Sotheby's Chairman A. Alfred
Taubman to a year and a day in prison and fined him $7.5 million for
his "supervisory and managerial role in the conspiracy."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks, like Taubman, had faced a possible three-year prison term
for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, which forbids unfair
competition by maintaining a monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   But her cooperation with prosecutors earned her the much lighter
sentence than that given her former boss. Brooks pleaded guilty in
October 2000 and was the principal witness against Taubman.</TE>
<TE>   "She has given substantial assistance in the prosecution of Mr.
Taubman," Patricia Jannaco, a lawyer with the Justice Department's
antitrust division, told the court. "Her testimony was essential, and
she cooperated fully."</TE>
<TE>   Daniels told Brooks that her cooperation was "wholehearted and
unequivocal," but quickly tempered his praise.</TE>
<TE>   "Your decision to cooperate with the government was not a noble
gesture motivated by a guilty conscience," he added. "Your decision
to cooperate was self-saving, not self-sacrificing. You have not
earned absolution."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks, 51, served as Sotheby's president and chief executive from
1994 to February 2000.</TE>
<TE>   One of her lawyers, John Siffert, in arguing against prison time,
said that Brooks had returned to Sotheby's 2.5 million stock options
worth $10 million and had repaid $3.25 million in salary earned while
the scheme was in effect.</TE>
<TE>   Her lawyers submitted a number of letters to Daniels urging
leniency before the court proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Among those writing was New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who
said he and Brooks had been close friends for many years and praised
her efforts to help an urban education program succeed. Bloomberg
said he was writing as a private citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks approached prosecutors with an offer to cooperate while she
was still Sotheby's president. But government lawyers already had
opened discussions with Christie's and its then-chief executive
officer, Christopher Davidge.</TE>
<TE>   The government later granted Christie's and Davidge immunity from
prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Taubman, the 78-year-old shopping center developer who bought
Sotheby's in 1983, was found guilty of plotting with Anthony J.
Tennant, Christie's chairman from 1983 to 1996, to fix the
commissions on what sellers paid when they put works of art and other
items up for bidding.</TE>
<TE>   Tennant has refused to travel from England to the United States
for trial, and under British law cannot be extradited in this case.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a spokesman said that Taubman would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   During Taubman's trial, Brooks testified that her former boss had
expressed anger when he learned that she was planning to help the
prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll look good in stripes," Brooks said Taubman told her.</TE>

<LD>In other matters Monday, the Supreme Court:</LD>
<LD>   * Ruled that pharmacies that mix legal drugs for patients or
doctors have a free-speech right to advertise their compounds.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration has exempted these specially made
"compounded drugs" from obtaining government approval, but it also
barred pharmacists from promoting their mixtures.</LD>
<TE>   On a 5-4 vote, the court said this restriction is unnecessary and
violates the 1st Amendment (Thompson vs. Western States Medical
Center, 01-344).</TE>
<TE>   * Agreed to take up a case that could open the way for more
lawsuits against cities and counties over dangerous intersections and
highways.</TE>
<TE>   To obtain federal highway safety funds, local agencies and
railroads submit data on the most dangerous intersections. The number
of vehicle accidents that happened there is tallied.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1983, federal law has said this information is private and

<TE>   But in a novel twist on the states' rights debate, the Washington
state Supreme Court struck down the federal law, saying that it

<HD>AIDS Scare at Tiny College Shakes Town</HD>
<DH>Health: S. Dakota officials say dozens, maybe hundreds,
have been exposed to HIV at campus. A basketball player is charged
with spreading the virus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HURON, S.D.</DL>
<LD>Here they are, college students from big cities in Texas and Florida,
Michigan and Arizona, living in a frozen farm town where the most
lively clubs around are the American Legion and the Veterans of
Foreign Wars.</LD>
<LD>   They are young and feel invincible. And they are bored.</LD>
<LD>   So, many students at SiTanka Huron University party just about
every night. They dance. They drink. And in an endless, reckless
game, they pair off--for a night or for an hour--with a new face. Or,
when there are no more new faces, with a familiar one.</LD>
<TE>   Sure, they've learned about condoms and AIDS in high school and
again--several times--at college. "But, being drunk.... And your
hormones are so raging," said freshman Tony Dawkins. "It's just like,
oh, forget about it."</TE>
<TE>   Forgetting is impossible now.</TE>
<TE>   Nikko Briteramos--a freshman and a friend--was led into court
Monday in a blue jail jumpsuit, charged with five counts of
intentionally exposing his new girlfriend to AIDS through unprotected
sex after learning late last month that he was infected with HIV.</TE>
<TE>   His hands were cuffed in front of him and shackled to his leather
belt. He was not permitted to talk to the two dozen friends who came
to show support. He is facing the possibility of 75 years in state
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Briteramos has given health officials the names of at least 10
other women with whom he has had unprotected sex in recent months.
Two have tested positive for HIV. Those two have listed 50 recent
partners between them.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say there are dozens, quite possibly hundreds more,
who may have been exposed to the deadly virus through the web of
sexual contacts that linked many of the 400 students on this small
private campus--and some "townies" in the community beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just pretty much everybody gets drunk and looks for someone
to hook up with. But there's a very limited pool, so you just go
around and around," freshman Matt Ratliff said as he gulped some milk
in a beat-up dorm hall that smelled of marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Through Sunday, at least 135 people had been tested. Some results
may not be back for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The open promiscuity has stunned many in this conservative
churchgoing community of 12,000. It also has laid bare tensions
between locals and the university.</TE>
<TE>   A fixture in Huron for 120 years, the university--now owned by the
Cheyenne River Sioux tribe--is welcomed for the scores of jobs it
provides. But there is an undercurrent of unease, too, because at
least half of the undergraduates come from out of state, recruited
for the Screaming Eagle athletic teams and given scholarships to
cover the $9,500 annual tuition.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these outsiders are black. Many come from big cities. On
both counts, they're viewed with suspicion in this wide-open Plains
state that, outside of the Native American reservations, is virtually
all white.</TE>
<TE>   The AIDS scare has only fueled those doubts. "This is indicative
of things that happen in the big city. We import them because we
import people from the big city," said Al Farrell, 62, who taught
business at the university for years.</TE>
<TE>   A few old-timers openly tag black students as the source of most
trouble. But there are many more in town who say they welcome the
diversity. Many African American students say they have encountered
little racism here.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is an undeniable clash of cultures when kids who have
grown up in Chicago or Fort Worth set down roots in Huron.</TE>
<TE>   The downtown strip is hopping compared to most small Midwest
towns--but it's hopping with farm machinery outlets and clip 'n' curl
beauty salons. There's a full calendar of cultural events, but
they're along the lines of the state bridge championship, the Kiwanis
Club variety show and the Huron gun club shoot. The bowling alley is
about as good as it gets for a young person's night on the town.</TE>
<TE>   So students tend to do a lot of complaining that there's nothing
to do except party in off-campus apartments.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only, what, 21 or 22 streets in Huron?" said Wildmike
Pata, a wrestler from West Palm Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   For all the grumbling, however, students often come to view Huron
as a haven, far from the violence and temptations they grew up with
in rougher cities. "I didn't hear my first police siren here until
January," marveled Tony Dawkins, 18, a freshman from Benton Harbor,
Mich. Briteramos' arrest shattered that trust in Huron as a world
apart.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-7 basketball star found out he was HIV-positive in late
March when he attempted to donate blood.</TE>
<TE>   Under South Dakota's confidentiality rules, no one would have
known of Briteramos' infection had state health officials not stopped
by his dorm on Thursday to interview him about his sexual partners.
He answered the door in his boxer shorts and refused to let them
in--asking them instead to meet him in a nearby bathroom to talk,
prosecutor Michael Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the health officials stayed in the hall and saw a young
woman scurry out of Briteramos' room, Moore said. He was arrested
that afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Briteramos had sex with the woman at least
five times since learning of his HIV infection--including the day of
his arrest. She has not tested positive for HIV, but it can take up
to six months for the virus to surface.</TE>
<TE>   In South Dakota--and in 20 other states--it is a crime for
individuals who know they are HIV-positive to engage in unprotected
sex without informing their partners.</TE>

<HD>Leader of 9/11 Probe Resigns Suddenly</HD>
<DH>Terror: Ex-CIA official was hired to investigate why spy
agencies failed to halt attacks. Some feared he would go easy on
ex-employer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A congressional investigation of the intelligence failures
surrounding the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has been thrown off course
by the sudden resignation of a former CIA official hired to lead the
inquiry but criticized for being too cozy with his former employer.</LD>
<LD>   L. Britt Snider, former inspector general at the CIA, resigned
under pressure Friday, less than three months into a high-stakes
probe designed to determine why the nation's spy agencies failed to
pick up any warning of the attacks on the World Trade Center and
Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   Snider's departure derails the inquiry at a time when
investigators are already poring over piles of intelligence agency
documents and planning a heavy summer schedule of congressional
hearings. Snider's resignation throws that schedule into doubt and
could be followed by additional departures, congressional sources
said.</LD>
<TE>   Ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence committees
declined to comment on Snider's resignation, citing the
confidentiality of personnel matters. Snider did not return calls to
his Virginia residence. Word of his departure did not circulate
through Washington until Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But congressional sources confirmed that Snider, 57, was forced
out amid growing concerns with his management of the investigation
ranging from the tone of his leadership to his personnel decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Several sources said Snider's resignation was sparked by troubling
questions that surfaced in recent weeks about whether one or more of
his hires lacked clearances to view classified material.</TE>
<TE>   There were also complaints about Snider's perceived reluctance to
cause trouble for his former colleagues at the CIA. One aide cited
"concerns over whether or not he had the aggressiveness to get this
thing done."</TE>
<TE>   Several Republicans had expressed such reservations about Snider
before he was hired. But sources said their concern came to be shared
more recently by Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, who had been Snider's key backer.</TE>
<TE>   Several members expressed hope that disruption caused by Snider's
departure would be minimal. "If the rest of the staff stays intact
and they get a good leader to take over, it might not slow it down
too much," said Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.). "I'm not particularly
concerned that this is going to be a big issue."</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, at least, Snider's top deputy, Rick Cinquegrana,
has been tapped to lead the investigation. Cinquegrana is also an
agency veteran, having worked under Snider as head of inspections at
the CIA's inspector general's office. It was not clear whether
Cinquegrana is seen as a potential permanent replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Criticism of Snider was not unanimous, and some committee members
voiced disappointment that his services had been lost.</TE>
<TE>   "Britt is a fine man," said Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), a member
of the House Select Committee on Intelligence. "I have high regard
for him and believe he could have directed a very impressive
project."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, Snider's brief tenure underscores the politically
treacherous nature of the committee's task. Even among the four
ranking members of the House and Senate committees, there is tension
over how aggressively to pursue the inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Members agree the public deserves straight answers about
intelligence failures, but are at odds over whether the inquiry
should seek to place direct blame at a time when few in Washington
are eager to be seen as unpatriotic.</TE>
<TE>   "Members are trying to say, 'We've got to get to the bottom of
what happened' while also saying, 'We don't want to make it into a
witch hunt,' " said former U.S. diplomat L. Paul Bremmer, who led a
previous probe of intelligence agencies after the bombing of U.S.
embassies in East Africa. Those conflicting impulses, Bremmer said,
"will be an inherent tension irrespective of who is the staff
director."</TE>
<TE>   Snider retired last year as CIA inspector general. He was
introduced as staff director on Feb. 14 as members of the House and
Senate Intelligence committees announced the creation of a joint
panel to examine failures surrounding the attacks on the World Trade
Center and Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   He had hired an investigative staff of 30, which has been
gathering evidence and lining up interviews with officials at the
CIA, FBI and other intelligence and law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The report, which members have said they hope to complete by
year's end, could help shape the intelligence community for years to
come. In fact, many in Washington see the investigation as equivalent
to landmark probes launched after the Japanese attacked Pearl
Harbor--an event that eventually led to the creation of the CIA
itself.</TE>
<TE>   Several GOP members, including Kyl and Sen. Richard C. Shelby
(R-Ala.), the ranking Republican on the Senate committee, expressed
doubts about Snider because of his close ties to CIA Director George
J. Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   Snider had served as a special counsel to Tenet at the CIA, and
was general counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee when Tenet
was its staff director in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</TE>

<HD>Mental Health Parity Urged</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Bush signals support for the same coverage as
those with physical ailments. The HMO industry says costs would
skyrocket.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush on Monday stepped into the growing debate over
insurance benefits for the mentally ill, calling for legislation to
eliminate disparities between coverage of patients with mental and
physical ailments.</LD>
<LD>   "Our health insurance system must treat mental illness like any
other disease," Bush said in an appearance before mental health
professionals in Albuquerque, before flying to Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The president did not endorse a specific bill or detail provisions
he could support. But lobbyists on both sides of the issue said
Bush's speech signaled his willingness to work with lawmakers on a
measure that would require wider insurance coverage for the most
serious mental illnesses. These would include major depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.</LD>
<TE>   Such coverage generally is opposed by many of Bush's business
allies, who warn about its effect on health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   Bush took note of such concerns. While stressing that he hoped
Congress could send him a bill this year, he said such legislation
should "not significantly run up the cost of health care."</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer added that the
administration's goal was to achieve "maximum parity" in insurance
coverage "without driving up costs so high that people lose insurance
in the end."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also announced the creation of a presidential commission to
recommend improvements in the nation's mental health care. The
22-member panel will be asked to identify patient needs and barriers
to care, and to recommend improvements within a year. Bush named
Michael Hogan, the director of Ohio's department of mental health, as
chairman.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the insurance debate is whether mental health
patients should receive coverage that is on a par with benefits
provided for physical illnesses. In most insurance plans, such parity
has long been lacking, and the inequity has emerged as a political
issue. Democrat Al Gore regularly won applause during his 2000
presidential campaign when he called for equivalent coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's remarks were his most extensive on the insurance issue
since he became president.</TE>
<TE>   "Our country must make a commitment," he said at the University of
New Mexico appearance. "Americans with mental illness deserve our
understanding and they deserve excellent care. They deserve a health
care system that treats their illness with the same urgency as a
physical illness."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "Health plans should not be allowed to apply unfair
treatment limitations or financial requirements on mental health
benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Bush identified such inequity in coverage as one of the three
major obstacles to confronting what he termed "the hidden sufferings
of Americans with mental illness."</TE>
<TE>   The other obstacles were the stigma that often surrounds mental
illness and a fragmented system for delivering services to the
mentally ill, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "Many Americans fall through the cracks of the current system,"
Bush said, in part because many mental disorders are hard to
diagnose.</TE>
<TE>   These are some of the problems he wants the new commission to
examine.</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 surgeon general's report found that more than 50 million
Americans--roughly 1 in 5--suffer from mental illness each year, but
that fewer than half of them seek treatment. The National Institutes
of Mental Health estimates the cost of untreated mental illness,
including criminal justice and social welfare costs, at about $300
billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials said they have begun preliminary talks with
the congressional supporters of improving insurance coverage for
mental illness. So far, Bush has been unwilling to require unlimited
coverage for all of the 277 conditions listed in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Still, supporters of parity in mental health coverage were
heartened by his remarks on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The American Psychiatric Assn. issued a statement expressing its
"gratitude and praise" to Bush for "his commitment to ending
discrimination ... against patients seeking treatment for mental
illness by supporting mental health parity legislation."</TE>
<TE>   But a statement by the American Assn. of Health Plans, a trade
group representing more than 1,000 health maintenance organizations,
illustrated the difficulties the administration will face in trying
to broker an agreement on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Proposals to mandate an expansion of mental health coverage at
the federal level would add billions of dollars to health-care costs
at a time when 40 million Americans lack access to health insurance,
and many more are struggling to afford the coverage they have," the
group said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Health Care Coalition, a group made up of such
politically powerful groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the
National Assn. of Manufacturers and the National Federation of
Independent Business, has prepared an advertisement telling Congress
to keep out of health care.</TE>
<TE>   "Not one more dime. Not one more dollar. Not one more bill that
raises health-care costs," the ad says.</TE>
<TE>   Bush shared the stage Monday with Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.),
a conservative who has joined with Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), a
liberal, to lead the push for an insurance parity bill.</TE>
<TE>   Their measure would not require any employer or group health
insurance plan to cover mental health care. It applies only to plans
that already offer mental health coverage, and it exempts businesses
with 50 or fewer employees.</TE>
<TE>   For Domenici and Wellstone, the campaign for stronger mental
health coverage involves a personal element. Both have watched family
members struggle with mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   Their bill would prohibit coverage limits imposed in a 1996 bill,
and would expand the range of mental illnesses covered. It includes
almost all conditions except substance abuse.</TE>
<TE>   California and 31 other states have mental health parity laws. The
California statute requires equal insurance coverage for all severe
mental illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   A Texas law, signed by then-Gov. Bush, is narrower, exempting
small businesses and restricting the types of illnesses covered,
while limiting outpatient visits to 60 a year and inpatient treatment
to 45 days annually.</TE>
<TE>   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the
Domenici-Wellstone bill would increase health insurance costs an
average of 0.9%, or roughly $23 billion a year. Opponents of the bill
say the 0.9% figure is far too low.</TE>

<HD>Nuns Hope Abuse Scandal Brings Extensive Reform</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN and MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEWTON, Mass.</DL>
<LD>The pictures from Rome filled Sister Marie LaBollita with fury. All
those white-haired men in red vestments, but not one victim of
clerical sexual abuse. Not a single family member to attest to the
toll of sexual violation. Not one expert on pedophilia.</LD>
<LD>   Not one woman.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a disgrace," said LaBollita, who watched the Vatican
gathering of America's cardinals last week from her office at Our
Lady Help of Christians Catholic church in Newton. "I'm outraged."</LD>
<TE>   Far from a feminist firebrand, this 41-year veteran of the Sisters
of Charity reflects the sense of indignation rising among many of
this country's 76,000 Roman Catholic nuns. For centuries, they stood
by in silent servitude while the men ran the shop. Now, with their
church roiled by a massive sex abuse scandal, many nuns are voicing
anger and a deep sense of betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   Along with thousands of lay Catholics and some in the clergy
itself, nuns are calling for a greater and more egalitarian role for
women in the church. Nuns have seized on the scandal as an
opportunity to question mandatory celibacy for the priesthood--and to
urge the church to adopt a more enlightened attitude toward
sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   Ranging from teenagers to elderly women and working in diverse
capacities, America's nuns are not a monolithic group. No poll has
been taken to generalize their response to the clerical abuse
scandal. But the nation's largest organization of nuns, the
Leadership Conference of Women Religious, plans to address the crisis
at meetings this week at the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   For nuns, the moment is pivotal, said Eugene Kennedy, author of
"The Unhealed Wound: The Church and Human Sexuality."</TE>
<TE>   "The American church owes its success to women, the nuns who have
sacrificed so heroically," said Kennedy, a professor emeritus at
Loyola University in Chicago. "These women have a clear consciousness
that they, as much as the buildings or the bishops, are the
church--and they are going to speak out. When that voice speaks, it
will speak clearly and loudly."</TE>
<TE>   For centuries, nuns have served as caregivers: teachers, nurses,
midwives and ministers "to those wounded by violence and stripped of
hope." Those very words appeared in the vow LaBollita, 61, took when
she joined her order. Since then, Vatican decrees have changed the
way nuns live. LaBollita has traded her habit for a red blazer and
trim black skirt. She drives her Honda so fast that friends call her
"the flying nun."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the sisters are beholden to an ancient institution
dominated by a male hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   But they see the prospect of revolution. Tragic and troubling as
it is, these nuns say, the controversy over sexual misconduct by
priests may just open the Vatican gates to long-needed reform.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this constitutes a turning point," said Chris Schenk, a
sister of St. Joseph in Cleveland. "It has energized the nuns. You're
looking at the consequences of a clerical culture that has cultivated
secrecy and excluded women. That's not going to work anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The church, agreed Joan Chittister, a Benedictine nun who lives in
Erie, Pa., cannot continue to stand on its "tripod culture" of
"silence, exclusivity and demonization."</TE>
<TE>   "What has happened in many cases is a crime, a sin. But it is also
a symptom of an institutional organization that needs change," said
Chittister, who was rebuked last year by Rome for writing and
lecturing on women's rights in the church.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are seeing is the beginning of reform in the church, not
the end by a long shot."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest changes would be the inclusion of women in church
policymaking and the expansion of the Catholic hierarchy to include
women.</TE>
<TE>   "It's got to happen," Chittister said. "You've got to engage the
whole church in determining what the church needs."</TE>
<TE>   When that will happen is another question. At present, Chittister
pointed out, "we have no official status whatsoever in the church
hierarchy. We will not be called on for this crisis, any more than
the laity will be called on."</TE>
<TE>   (The nuns answer to the heads of their orders, who report to the
Vatican. In some cases, nuns also are subject to the authority of
local dioceses.)</TE>
<TE>   Many nuns also want an end to secretive practices in the church.</TE>
<TE>   "The structure of the church does not allow for open
conversation," said Sister Nancy Sylvester, a member of the Servants
of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and former director of a social
justice lobbying group in Washington, D.C. "Secrecy is a tool the
leadership uses to maintain power and control over issues of
controversy."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, these nuns are calling for more open discussions
about sexual ethics in the church.</TE>
<TE>   "The theology of human sexuality is woefully underdeveloped in the
Roman Catholic Church," said Sister Kathleen Pruitt of Seattle,
president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious. While
forbidden to marry, nuns tend to be better educated than priests in
the field of human sexuality because their professional training
requires it, said Pruitt, a sister of St. Joseph of Peace.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country--in cloisters, provincial offices and on
college campuses--nuns are meeting, talking, praying and
communicating via the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   They express feelings of intense sadness for sexual abuse victims
and their families. But they swiftly take aim at the authority that
permitted sexual predators to work in their midst: Catholic officials
who they say moved pedophile priests from parish to parish and
carefully tried to cover their tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Some nuns feel torn between loyalty to the faith they have pledged
their lives to and impatience with an institution rife with
anachronisms.</TE>
<TE>   "Women religious struggle with the ambivalent feelings we have
sometimes about the church," said Carole Shinnick, a School Sister of
Notre Dame who is executive director of the Leadership Conference of
Women Religious in Silver Spring, Md. "But we love the church and see
this as a time when something good may come."</TE>
<TE>   Shinnick, a clinical social worker, summoned Gospel metaphors to
illustrate how strength and redemption can come from sorrow and
suffering. She recalled studying institutional lags in graduate
school--how the populace generally moves faster than its leaders and
organizations. And while hopeful, she conceded: "To say Rome moves
slowly is an understatement."</TE>
<TE>   From her Carmelite cloister in Indianapolis, Sister Teresa uses a
Web site, praythenews.com, to comment on the pedophilia scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "Sexual abuse is not uncommon in primitive societies," she said.
"But you expect more from the church. It's hard to accept that the
problem was never dealt with."</TE>
<TE>   Like their parishioners, America's nuns trusted the church and
were shocked to learn how rampant sexual misconduct among priests has
been, said Margaret Farley, a Sister of Mercy who teaches ethics at
Yale Divinity School and has written extensively on sexual ethics.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe not as shocked as other people," Farley acknowledged. "Nuns
tend to know the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of priests, more so
than other people do."</TE>
<TE>   But all her years as a teacher and as someone who ministers in
times of crisis could not prepare LaBollita for the knot that
clenched her stomach early this year.</TE>
<TE>   In the parish women's group at Our Lady Help of Christians,
LaBollita had listened while Paula Ford, a soprano in the choir,
talked about problems her son Greg, 24, was experiencing. When she
read a Boston Globe article about Father Paul Shanley, a priest
accused of pedophilia who served as pastor and taught children's
religious classes at Our Lady, LaBollita shuddered. The phone call
from Paula Ford confirmed her fears.</TE>
<TE>   LaBollita embraced Greg Ford after a news conference at which his
lawyer displayed church documents that showed the Boston Archdiocese
was well aware that Shanley had advocated sex with children. At a
court hearing this month at which the Ford family won the right to
seek a deposition from Boston's Cardinal Bernard Law, LaBollita shook
lawyer Roderick MacLeish Jr.'s hand and praised him "for doing God's
work."</TE>
<TE>   She knew that in some official circles of the church, her support
of the family and their lawyer might be viewed as
insubordination--and she did not care.</TE>
<TE>   "It is all of us women who are the nurturers, and together we have
to turn the tide," LaBollita said. "It is all of our responsibility
to move for reform in the church."</TE>
<TE>   LaBollita turned again to the image of Pope John Paul II and his
American cardinals, gathered in Rome to establish church policy on
sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "A whole group of men making those decisions?" LaBollita marveled
once again. "It is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Along with her sisters across the country, LaBollita said, she
finds herself part of "a revolutionary moment," a time when "this
whole issue of sexual abuse is putting us on a path toward reform.
Where it will take us remains to be seen. But I am very hopeful."</TE>

<HD>Desperate Effort to Regain Custody Backfires</HD>
<DH>Court: The state seized the three Christine girls because
it feared they were starving. Their parents took them back at
gunpoint and are now jailed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GRANTS PASS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Brian Christine was an Eagle Scout, active in his university's
Christian fellowship. Ruth taught English to Tibetan refugees and
volunteered at a Mother Teresa home for the disabled. Together, they
decided to offer their three young daughters a different kind of
childhood: home-schooling in a strict Christian environment and a
chance to see America in a converted old bus.</LD>
<LD>   They toured the Grand Canyon and Yosemite National Park, but never
made it past this old stagecoach stop in the Rogue River Valley.
Today, Brian and Ruth Christine go on trial in Douglas County Circuit
Court on charges of kidnapping their daughters, at gunpoint, from the
hands of the state child welfare department, which had seized custody
of the girls.</LD>
<LD>   These days, there are two photographs of the Christine family in
the court file.</LD>
<TE>   The first--the one the Christines like to pull out--shows Bethany,
then 5, 3-year-old Lydia and Miriam, 2, in their Sunday school
dresses, ribbons in their hair, healthy and happy at the feet of
their smiling parents. It was taken during a supervised visit a few
months after the girls were taken from the Christines.</TE>
<TE>   The second picture, taken the day the state took custody, shows
the girls huddled on a bench--their cheeks hollow, their skin hanging
from their bones, their eyes scared and wary. Lydia has a dirty
bandage on her forehead from a wound so infected that it smells. The
back of her skull is fractured.</TE>
<TE>   Which is the true picture? "The big question mark, and it still is
unanswered," said Josephine County Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Newman,
"is whether Brian and Ruth realized that their children were starving
to death."</TE>
<TE>   The case has become a rallying point for groups across the country
that are critical of child protection agencies and the government in
general. It is a favorite with right-wing talk radio and conservative
publications, which seem to have found the story they've been waiting
for--a righteous young couple battling a government run amok.</TE>
<TE>   "I determined they were pretty good people ... caught up in a
system that, without due process, coerces people into signing
confessions for crimes they may not have committed," said talk show
host Roger Fredinburg of Medford, Ore. "All you have to do is have a
finger pointed at you, and all of a sudden your life is destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   The Christines had been in Grants Pass for only a few months back
in 2000, their bus parked behind the public library, when an
anonymous caller told police that Lydia looked dehydrated.</TE>
<TE>   Detective Dan Evans, sent to investigate, concluded that all three
children looked malnourished. Lydia had a bandaged forehead and a
black eye, Evans said in his report. "She told me her dad hit her
....I spoke to Brian, who admitted to striking Lydia on the head
because she had peed in the bed. Brian said he lost his temper."</TE>
<TE>   State officials say the girls were not just underweight. Bethany
weighed only 25 pounds, half the average weight of a 5-year-old; all
three were in the lowest 5th percentile for weight. And Lydia's skull
fracture, which came from an undetermined injury about 30 days
earlier, was likely very painful but was left untreated, doctors
said. A judge found the girls were "at risk for permanent effects or
even death" in the custody of their parents.</TE>
<TE>   The Christines' lawyer, Edgar Steele, said both Ruth and Brian are
slight--Brian, at 5 feet, 10 inches weighs only 140 pounds. "I hate
to say this, but it's only in our generation that the normal kid is
fat," Steele said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Ruth said the family fasted about once a month,
skipping breakfast and lunch. "We tried to eat a real healthy diet, a
lot of fruits and vegetables. We tried to eat organic food," she
said. "When the police came, we were eating lunch and drinking water.
I told them, I don't think there's a problem.... But it was a really
hot day, and really stressful and really difficult for the children."</TE>
<TE>   She agreed to let the girls be examined at the hospital, and then
was told she would have to leave them with the state. "That was the
last time I saw them for eight months."</TE>
<TE>   The Christines were horrified at what was happening to their
children. Although there was no allegation of sexual abuse, "a
[state] worker took photographs of our stripped daughters' bodies and
genitalia and tried to submit the photos as evidence to the court....
[They] also administered invasive, painful sexual examinations to our
daughters over their objections," Brian wrote in a statement. "In
addition, [the state] violated our daughters by injecting them with
live viruses [vaccinations], which is deeply against their religious
beliefs."</TE>
<TE>   The Christines probably would have been able to get their children
back from foster care within a few months if they had agreed to
undergo psychological examinations and parental counseling. But they
refused. They also refused court-appointed attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   After eight months, the state allowed the Christines to see their
children, but only permitted three visits. In court papers, officials
cited evidence that the Christines might be planning to abduct their
children.</TE>
<TE>   A Web site formerly maintained by the Christines talked about
protecting children "physically, mentally, and by all other means
possible."</TE>
<TE>   Even some of those who had befriended the Christines in Grants
Pass became concerned that the couple was waving a flag of
anti-government militancy and not doing everything they could to get
their children back.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Conrad, a writer and remodeling contractor, at first had
taken up the Christines' cause and distributed flyers about their
plight all over town.</TE>
<TE>   "Those kids weren't emaciated. They were small. Thin. As were the
parents. I was quite moved by what I thought was the cruelty of the
action," Conrad said.</TE>
<TE>   But he couldn't understand why the Christines wouldn't agree to
the counseling and psychological testing. "I told them, hey, you
gotta go get your kids out. You do that first. Do whatever it takes.
Then get your law degree, whatever, fight government your whole
life."</TE>
<TE>   But with Brian Christine, Conrad said, "That was the end of his
friendliness to me. He said, 'No, I'm going to raise hell about
this.'"</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Christines began to cooperate. But it was too late.
Deadlines imposed under federal law required the state to find a
permanent new home for the children. The state terminated their
parental rights and awarded permanent custody to Ruth's parents in
England.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2001--just as the adoption proceedings were coming to a
head--the Christines visited their children at a state office in
Grants Pass. Then, according to a grand jury indictment, Brian
followed the girls and their caseworker to a rest stop on the freeway
and seized the youngsters at gunpoint.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested four days later in Montana. Ruth was found two
days after that with the girls, living with friends-of-a-friend, at a
home in a remote canyon near Missoula.</TE>
<TE>   Aubrey Jessop, whose father had offered Ruth and her children a
place to stay, recalled that the police "came in with full guns and
[camouflage] and face paint and arrested her in front of her kids,
screaming," she said. "It was really barbaric. The one little girl
was sitting there when the cops came and said, 'I'm not going with
you anywhere.'"</TE>
<TE>   Ruth said one of the sheriff's deputies brought Miriam, who was
crying uncontrollably, to ride with her in the police car. "I didn't
know how to show her it was OK, because I knew in my heart it
wasn't," Ruth said. "I was so afraid. But at that moment, God made me
see that he was in control. And I started singing, 'Jesus loves me,
this I know.' [Miriam] joined in and ... fell asleep while we were
singing."</TE>
<TE>   But Ruth--who had given birth to a fourth daughter after the state
took the three girls away and had left the baby with Brian's mother
in Indiana--was pregnant again. She went through labor in handcuffs
and leg shackles.</TE>
<TE>   The baby, another daughter, was taken away six hours later and
Ruth was sent back to jail.</TE>
<TE>   "They took her out of my arms," Ruth said. "I was crying, the
nurses and all the midwives were crying, the [police] guards were
crying." The baby was placed with Brian's mother, and both Christines
were returned to Oregon for trial.</TE>
<TE>   Steele said he would show that the Christines were guilty of no
more than trying to get their children back. "What they did, if and
when proven by the state, will be shown to be an act of ... parents
driven nearly out of their minds by out-of-control state agency
bureaucrats," he said. "Nobody, absolutely nobody, should think badly
of them for doing what they did."</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Says Family at Fault in Priest Abuse</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Boston prelate law asserts that 6-year-old boy and
his parents were negligent in molestation case. Their suit claims
archdiocese didn't protect youngster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Cardinal Bernard Law, firing back in an increasingly contentious
clerical sexual scandal, has declared in court papers that
unspecified "negligence" of a then-6-year-old boy and his parents
contributed to the alleged abuse.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's longest-serving Catholic prelate made the assertion
in response to a lawsuit filed against him and the archdiocese by
Gregory Ford and his parents. Now 24, Ford claims he was molested for
six years by Father Paul Shanley, a priest in the Boston archdiocese.</LD>
<LD>   Law is scheduled to be deposed June 5 in the Fords' civil suit,
which charges that the cardinal and the archdiocese failed to protect
young Gregory.</LD>
<TE>   More than 1,600 pages of documents turned over by the archdiocese
have produced sordid allegations against Shanley, who was reassigned
by Law to a parish in Southern California in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley, now 71, recently was let go from his volunteer job with
the San Diego police department. Although his whereabouts have been
unknown, a lawyer for the Fords said he expected Shanley to be
deposed as scheduled Thursday. MacLeish would not say where the
deposition will take place.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have located him," Roderick MacLeish Jr. said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to the Rogers Law Firm, which represents the cardinal, and
to the archdiocese went unreturned.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to asserting that the Ford family's negligence
contributed to alleged abuse by Shanley, a document filed by the firm
on Law's behalf said that any damages awarded should be
proportionately reduced.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal's six-page response to the Fords' complaint was filed
in Middlesex Superior Court earlier this month. It was first reported
publicly in Monday's Boston Globe, which has aggressively pursued the
clerical sexual abuse scandal here.</TE>
<TE>   At a press conference Monday, MacLeish blasted the cardinal's
claim as "appalling. What is the conceivable evidence to support the
idea that Ford [and his parents] were somehow responsible for what
Paul Shanley did to them?"</TE>
<TE>   MacLeish said he saw a "common theme" in the church's response:
"One, blame the priests. Two, blame the victims. Three, gag the
lawyers. Four, don't turn over documents--and when you do, turn them
over in incomplete portions."</TE>
<TE>   He also called the latest action by the archdiocese "bad legal
strategy," because anything contained in the new filing can be
questioned at the cardinal's deposition.</TE>
<TE>   MacLeish said he would be in court Wednesday to try to force the
church to turn over records of Shanley's psychiatric evaluations.</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Ford, Gregory's father, said Monday that the motion filed
by the cardinal was hard for his son to stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating Mass on Sunday, Law said: "These are not easy days to
serve in the pastoral role that is mine. All of us are wounded
healers. And when we remember that, we are able to be the people that
we should be.... When we are not that, we degenerate into anger and
division. And that's not who we are. That's not who God calls us to
be."</TE>
<TE>   The sexual abuse scandal hit the U.S. Roman Catholic church in
January, with disclosures that the Boston archdiocese moved
now-defrocked priest John Geoghan from parish to parish despite
repeated allegations that he was a pedophile.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan is serving an eight- to 10-year prison term on one count
of child molestation.</TE>
<TE>   In New York on Monday, Cardinal Edward Egan gathered hundreds of
priests to discuss the sexual abuse scandal. A similar meeting also
was held Monday in the New Hampshire archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Allegations of sexual abuse also prompted priests in Florida,
Michigan, Ohio, California and Iowa to either resign or be suspended
over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), speaking Monday at the Boston
Latin School, lamented the clerical sexual abuse crisis as "the most
tragic circumstance that I have seen in the Catholic church in my
lifetime."</TE>

<HD>Security Fails Tests in Atlanta</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Working undercover, congressional investigators gained unauthorized
access to four Atlanta federal buildings and easily sneaked
briefcases and packages past security checkpoints.</LD>
<LD>   One investigator obtained two different security badges and a
guard's after-hours access code, according to a General Accounting
Office report obtained Monday by Associated Press. One pass allowed
the investigator to carry a firearm in the buildings.</LD>
<LD>   The report, to be discussed today at a congressional hearing in
Atlanta, raises questions about security at federal buildings in the
aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "This is pretty alarming," said Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.),
chairman of the House Intelligence homeland security subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's extremely difficult to get your arms around all
the vulnerabilities out there from a threat standpoint, but you would
think our federal agencies would be paying more attention to in-house
matters than they are."</TE>
<TE>   During February and March, GAO investigators were able to bypass
X-ray machines and other security devices, carrying items that could
have been explosives, chemical weapons or listening devices,
according to Ronald Malfi, acting director for the GAO's Office of
Special Investigations.</TE>
<TE>   One agent entered the building without any identification and
convinced a General Services Administration employee to issue him a
building pass and after-hours access code. The next day, he was able
to upgrade that pass to one allowing him to carry weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Both passes were then counterfeited, using commercial software,
and other agents were able to enter the buildings with the bogus
passes, which included their photographs and fictitious names.</TE>

<HD>EPA Puts a Chill on Snowmobiles</HD>
<DH>Report: The agency backs plan to eliminate the vehicles
from Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Environmental Protection Agency, in a report released Monday,
recommends that snowmobiles be banned from Yellowstone and Grand
Teton national parks, stating that wintertime exhaust from the
popular snow machines violates air quality laws and jeopardizes human
health.</LD>
<LD>   The EPA report says that the agency is concerned that as a result
of the Bush administration's decision to postpone a phased
elimination of snowmobiles, "air quality, human health and visibility
continued to be impaired" last winter.</LD>
<LD>   The report is part of a public comment process that will lead to a
final decision on the use of snowmobiles in Yellowstone and Grand
Teton by the National Park Service next November. Comments on the
Park Service's snowmobile regulations will be accepted until May 29.</LD>
<TE>   "The EPA is saying the Park Service has abundant evidence of
snowmobile damage in Yellowstone and that it made the right judgment
a year ago when it decided to phase out snowmobile use," said Jon
Catton, spokesman for the Greater Yellowstone Coalition in Bozeman,
Mont.</TE>
<TE>   Snowmobile interests argue that the EPA's findings ignore data
from manufacturers that show some new engine designs are cleaner and
quieter than those made even a couple of years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really surprised that the EPA didn't look at all of that,"
Jack Welch, president of BlueRibbon Coalition, told Associated Press.
The Pocatello, Idaho-based group advocates keeping federal lands open
to snowmobilers and other motorized recreation.</TE>
<TE>   According to the EPA, the best way to control air pollution while
continuing to permit some mechanized access in winter is to go ahead
with a ban while allowing multi-passenger "snow coaches" that
resemble small buses on motorized tracks. Those vehicles would be
environmentally acceptable, the agency concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "EPA fully supports continued winter access to ... national parks.
EPA is satisfied that ... park resources can be protected while
maintaining motorized winter access," wrote Max H. Dodson, an
assistant regional EPA administrator in Denver, in an April 23 letter
to the Park Service.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration decision to ban the vehicles was
reached in 2000 but revisited under President Bush after the
International Snowmobile Manufacturers Assn. and others filed a
lawsuit challenging the pending ban. Under a settlement agreement,
the National Park Service proposed a variety of options to permit at
least limited snowmobile use, even as Yellowstone rangers donned
respirators last winter to protect themselves from noxious exhaust.</TE>
<TE>   Among the options being considered by the Park Service, besides
imposition of a ban, are limits on the number of snowmobiles, cleaner
machines and better supervision by rangers or guides. But the EPA, in
detailed comments on the proposals, disputed whether those controls
could be enforced or produce significant results.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the EPA said most of the proposals would continue to
allow unacceptably high levels of carbon monoxide, a harmful gas from
tailpipes.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Montana's carbon monoxide limit is 23 parts per
million, but snowmobiles congregating at Yellowstone's busy west
entrance would increase pollution levels 39% over the limit, said
Phillip Strobel, an environmental engineer for the EPA. Snowmobile
use could also violate federal air quality standards under the right
meteorological conditions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Park Service "has been aware of this significant air quality
issue for a number of years and we therefore do not understand why it
is not addressed in ... all alternatives considered in" its
environmental impact study, the EPA report says.</TE>
<TE>   Under stagnant, cold conditions, pollution gets trapped low to the
ground and can quickly build to harmful levels. Rangers at
Yellowstone have resorted to wearing gas masks in the winter to
protect against the fumes and fresh air is pumped into their kiosks.</TE>
<TE>   Carbon monoxide cheats the body of oxygen by binding to red blood
cells. In high doses, it can be fatal. In low doses it can cause
dizziness, headaches, nausea and neurological impairment.</TE>
<TE>   Last winter, about 70,000 snowmobiles descended on Yellowstone
along with hundreds more at nearby Grand Teton National Park. The
machines lack efficient engines or pollution control devices like
cars or light trucks and their emissions contribute to impaired
visibility. Environmentalists and Park Service studies, too, raise
concerns about noise and nuisance to wildlife and other park
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit by the snowmobile makers was joined by the BlueRibbon
Coalition and the state of Wyoming. Off-road enthusiasts say
snowmobiles are compatible with the park and benefit the local
economy. They have charged the Clinton administration's proposed ban
would unfairly limit their access to public land. Representatives for
snowmobile-making companies could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>States Pick Up the Pieces After Deadly Tornadoes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>By Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LA PLATA, Md.</DL>
<LD>Deborah McClain was hiding in her basement with her husband and six
children when La Plata was ripped by a deadly tornado, one of the
most powerful in Maryland history.</LD>
<LD>   "When it was over, I went upstairs and all you could see was the
sky," said McClain, 41. "The roof was gone. The wall was gone. The
beds had gone out the window."</LD>
<LD>   The tornado delivered winds of more than 260 mph, making it the
strongest on record in the state and topping the scale used to
measure twisters.</LD>
<TE>   Tornado-ravaged cities from Missouri to Maryland picked up the
pieces Monday, a day after an unusually potent batch of storms plowed
across the eastern U.S.</TE>
<TE>   At least six people were killed, including three in a pair of
hard-hit Maryland counties south of the nation's capital. More than
100 people were injured across the country and thousands lost power.</TE>
<TE>   The tornado that hit La Plata was an F5, the most powerful,
according to a preliminary determination by the National Weather
Service. In Charles County alone, the twister destroyed six houses
and left a track of damage 24 miles long and 400 yards wide. Damage
still needed to be evaluated in Calvert County.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Fujita scale, a twister with an F5 rating has winds from
261 mph to 318 mph. Maryland has never had an F5 and only two F4s are
on record--including one in 1926 that killed 14 schoolchildren in La
Plata.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Parris Glendening declared a state of emergency for Charles,
Calvert and Dorchester counties, freeing the National Guard to help.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who surveyed the damage from
the air, said the tornado appeared to have touched down "like a
bouncing ball."</TE>
<TE>   Among the dead was Margaret Albey, 74, whose small wood-frame home
lay in the storm's path. Her body was found under a couch alongside
her 77-year-old husband, George, who survived.</TE>
<TE>   The tornado also destroyed a school. Public schools in Calvert
County were closed Monday and will be closed again today. The roof
caved in at Rock Church, which put up a small, temporary sign reading
"Rock Church. God is still in control. Call for prayer."</TE>
<TE>   The storms struck states throughout the Tennessee and Ohio valleys
on Sunday before hitting Maryland. The northern edge of the system
brought heavy snow to Wisconsin and Minnesota.</TE>

<HD>Daniel G. McCoy, 52; Rescue Pilot, Retired Santa Ana Police
Captain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retired Santa Ana Police Capt. Daniel G. McCoy, an avid airplane
pilot who transported emergency medical patients to hospitals in his
spare time, died Saturday of complications from brain cancer. He was
52.</LD>
<LD>   McCoy was a pioneer in using DNA technology to solve old cases and
was a leader of the Police Department's massive gang suppression
unit. One of his most innovative projects involved a campaign to
confiscate illegal weapons being used by gangs on the streets.</LD>
<LD>   Colleagues remembered McCoy as a man who deftly juggled his family
responsibilities as a father of two, with his long working hours and
his passion for flying. He joined the Police Department in 1971 and
rose to the rank of captain in 1990.</LD>
<TE>   "His family was his main passion," said oldest brother Michael
McCoy. "But he gave everything to his job too, and he loved to fly."</TE>
<TE>   McCoy was part of the Marine Corps reserves and was an advocate
for veterans. McCoy persuaded the Navy to donate an A-4 airplane that
he hoped to display on a pedestal in front of the Santa Ana Civic
Center to honor Marines at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   The airplane is now being refurbished, and others in the
department will continue to plan for the memorial in his absence,
said Sgt. Baltazar De La Riva.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy's former partner, Hugh Mooney, described him as a
courageous, honest and funny man. He recalled that McCoy, who stood
above six feet, often bumped his head against chandeliers when they
went to people's homes as police officers.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no pretense about him," Mooney said. "He was very
honest. He didn't try to put [on] a macho attitude. People trusted
him. He was a man of his word."</TE>
<TE>   McCoy helped in several community organizations including
volunteering his airplane to fly medical patients as part of Angel
Flight West.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife Robin, his daughters, Danielle and
Renee, and four grandchildren. The family has asked that people
donate to the memorial project in place of flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be held at 10 a.m. Friday at Calvary Chapel in Santa
Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Donations can be made payable to Marine Corps Memorial Fund/OCCF
and mailed to Orange County Community Foundation, 2081 Business
Center Drive, Suite 100, Irvine CA 92612-1115.</TE>

<HD>Housing Boom at Border With a View of Tijuana</HD>
<DH>Development: Federal officials credit change to a 1994
crackdown, while real estate experts cite demand for open land in San
Diego County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Coral Gate could be any Southern California suburban housing
development, a swirl of curving roads lined with large,
red-tile-roofed stucco houses.</LD>
<LD>   But this tidy community of almost 500 homes sits directly across
the street from the corrugated metal fence marking the U.S.-Mexico
border. From their backyards, the residents of Coral Gate have a view
of the hills of Tijuana.</LD>
<LD>   None of it was here a decade ago, when this land in the Tijuana
River basin was one of the most heavily traveled thoroughfares for
Mexican immigrants making their way north. Thousands attempted to
scale the northern levy of the Tijuana River at night and escape
across what were then barren fields. Smugglers and bandits roamed the
area, preying on immigrants, and outnumbered Border Patrol agents
sometimes found the bodies of people who had been raped and murdered
amid the tumbleweeds.</LD>
<TE>   "It was the wild, wild west," said Border Patrol Agent Raleigh
Leonard. The new projects "never could have existed before Operation
Gatekeeper."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard was referring to a crackdown on illegal border commerce,
which along with a housing boom in southern San Diego County has
dramatically altered the hills and beaches once used as clandestine
entry routes into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   New tract housing communities with names like Dolphin Cove and
Remington Hills are being dug out of the hillsides that used to be
covered by sagebrush and dotted with Border Patrol radar towers.
Expensive condominiums are going up along the beaches once heavily
trafficked by illegal immigrants. An outlet mall featuring such
stores as Tommy Hilfiger and Liz Claiborne opened in November right
at the international line, down the street from Coral Gate.</TE>
<TE>   The Border Patrol credits the transformation to its 1994
crackdown, which doubled the number of agents and increased security
with new fences, lights and sensors. The measures pushed the flow of
immigration to the east, where many Mexicans now attempt an often
perilous and sometimes fatal journey across the deserts and mountains
of Imperial County.</TE>
<TE>   Local home builders say the new developments are as much a product
of San Diego's insatiable appetite for housing.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what the cause, the U.S. side of the border has
undergone a major make-over since the early 1990s, when most of the
rugged canyons were deserted and real estate agents in Imperial Beach
had to reassure worried buyers about living just north of Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   "There was always a perception of the area south of the 8 Freeway
that it was not necessarily a desirable location," said Robert
Pletcher, a project manager for Corky McMillan Companies, a major
home builder. "We've shattered all those myths."</TE>
<TE>   In the last three years, about 7,500 new housing units have gone
up in the South Bay area of Chula Vista, Otay Mesa, San Ysidro and
Imperial Beach, with an average value of about $330,000, according to
Alan Nevin, director of economic research at MarketPoint Realty
Advisors.</TE>
<TE>   Master-planned communities such as Ocean View Hills and Otay Ranch
advertise houses with formal entries, three-car garages and up to
eight bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "NEW HOMES!" blares a billboard off the 905 Freeway, just north of
the port of entry in San Ysidro, where tractors busily clear the
land. Several dozen yards away, a yellow sign features the silhouette
of a running family, a warning to drivers to watch out for migrants.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate analysts say it is difficult to know how much credit
for the change can go to increased border security, because open land
for housing is in such demand in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "They're building everywhere and anywhere they can in San Diego
County," said John Karevoll, an analyst for DataQuick, a firm that
tracks housing prices.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Patrick Kruer said he wasn't concerned about the
proximity to the border when he bought up the 155 acres of empty
fields back in 1988 that eventually became Coral Gate. At the time,
he was looking for a place to build affordable homes.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some concern by some people, but we saw the border as
an opportunity ... to provide very affordable housing and create a
catalyst to doing something nice there," Kruer said.</TE>
<TE>   The recession of the early 1990s delayed development until 1997,
but when Coral Gate opened, the units--priced from about $130,000 to
$170,000--sold out immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Drawn by the price, retail sales manager Gary Lane signed up to
buy a house before it was even constructed, eventually moving into a
two-story home with a view of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Lane grew up in nearby Imperial Beach, where he often saw
immigrants fleeing through his backyard and the headlights of Border
Patrol trucks sweeping through his windows at night.</TE>
<TE>   But Lane said he was pleasantly surprised when he moved to Coral
Gate to discover the illegal traffic had slowed to a trickle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's made a difference for the average home buyer," he said. "I
grew up here and accepted it, but a lot of people wouldn't have moved
in if it was still going on."</TE>
<TE>   Another Coral Gate homeowner, Alberto Matamoros, said he was
apprehensive about the safety of the area when he moved in two years
ago. His uncle, who bought a home nearby 10 years earlier, had seen
hundreds of immigrants race across the fields.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, at nighttime, it was crazy here," Matamoros said as he
pushed his 2-year-old daughter on a swing at a local park. "But we've
had no problems."</TE>
<TE>   Matamoros' house has almost doubled in value. And he's especially
excited about the new mall down the street called Las Americas. The
outdoor shopping plaza has 75 stores including Banana Republic and
Polo Jeans, along with a variety of restaurants. Along the back of
the mall, the border fence snakes across the hills into the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Las Americas is in a city redevelopment area, so a portion of
property tax revenue goes to revitalizing San Ysidro, a prospect that
excites community leaders who have long agitated for more investment
in the border region.</TE>
<TE>   A new public library is scheduled to be built in Las Americas, and
a new high school is going up at the edge of San Ysidro to handle an
increase in students.</TE>
<TE>   "The South Bay is going to be the next growth area for the
region," said Andrea Skorepa, chief executive of Casa Familiar, a
nonprofit community development organization in San Ysidro. "[Home
buyers] are looking at us with new eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Just to the west, Imperial Beach--a laid-back beach town of 26,000
that advertises itself as the most southwesterly city in the
continental U.S.--has undergone a similar change.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, thousands of immigrants tramped up the narrow beach,
often meeting smugglers in waiting vans. But in the last few years,
the flow has all but stopped, and interest in Imperial Beach real
estate has spiked.</TE>
<TE>   Spacious two-story houses have replaced modest beach bungalows.
The city's first $1-million-plus condominium sold this year, in a
beach complex with a view of the Tijuana bull ring on a nearby hill.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate agent Cheryl Schaumburg said the border crackdown has
contributed to rising home values--including a 27% jump in Imperial
Beach last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's made a world of difference," Schaumburg said. "It used to
be, you had to sell everything twice. People would come here and fall
in love with the property, and then they would go home and tell their
families and friends, who would say, 'You can't buy in Imperial
Beach.'"</TE>
<TE>   Lorie Bragg-Kerr, executive director of the local Chamber of
Commerce, said she sympathizes with the immigrants and understands
their economic reasons for coming north.</TE>
<TE>   But the frequent traffic often brought crime, she said, and
contributed to a perception that Imperial Beach wasn't a good place
to live.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a question we used to field here at the office: 'We hear
you have a problem with illegal immigrants,'" Bragg-Kerr said. "We
had to say yes."</TE>
<TE>   "Now," she added, "it doesn't even come up."</TE>

<HD>Volunteers Continue Search for Missing Boy</HD>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Police, neighbors and Navy sailors searched Monday for 2-year-old
Jahi Turner, as police reported finding the "mystery woman" who was
said to have been nearby when the boy disappeared Thursday from a
public park here.</LD>
<LD>   Although police said that they would continue talking to the
woman, she had provided no obvious boost to the search for the boy,
the son of a Navy sailor.</LD>
<LD>   "We have spoken with her and will be speaking with her again,"
said police spokesman David Cohen. "She is not a suspect."</LD>
<TE>   Cohen declined to say how police located the woman or what she
might have told them about the boy, who police believe was kidnapped.</TE>
<TE>   Tieray Jones, Turner's stepfather, told police that the boy
vanished in the 15 minutes he left him at a Balboa Park annex while
going for a soda. Jones reported that the only other adult in the
area was a woman with short hair and a lean face.</TE>
<TE>   Among the several dozen volunteer searchers were 15 sailors from
the amphibious transport ship Rushmore, based in San Diego. Tameka
Jones, the boy's mother, is stationed aboard the Rushmore and was at
sea on a training mission when her husband reported Jahi missing</TE>
<TE>   The Navy brought her back to San Diego by helicopter to assist in
the search.</TE>
<TE>   Several dozen volunteers gathered at the local Moose Lodge for a
day of searching the streets and brushy canyons near the family's
apartment in the South Park-Golden Hill neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "You sleep better knowing that at least you tried to help, instead
of just watching the news," said Priscilla Resendez, who searched
while pushing a stroller with her 2-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said that the searches failed to "produce anything of
significance."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the volunteers had also been part of the search for
Danielle van Dam, who disappeared Feb. 2 from her home in the upscale
Sabre Springs neighborhood of San Diego. Volunteers found her body
Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   "I love children and felt compelled to help any way I can," said
Ellie Elmore, a substitute teacher who worked in both searches. "I'm
just an average citizen who wants to help."</TE>

<HD>Crane Jackson, 69; Producer Began Actors Workshop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crane Jackson, an actor and producer who founded Theater Rapport, a
50-seat actors workshop and performance center in Los Angeles, has
died at the age of 69.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson died April 17 in Los Angeles of a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., and raised in Florida, where he graduated
from the University of Miami, Jackson moved to Hollywood in 1967 and
began his workshop theater the next year.</LD>
<TE>   He soon converted a bowling alley on South Vermont Avenue into a
theater and launched what he called "The Uncommon Theater Series,"
beginning with a production of "Moby Dick Rehearsed."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Jackson won a waiver from the Actors' Equity Assn.
in 1972 to charge admission, Times critic Dan Sullivan wrote of a
play about Emily Dickinson: "There is merit here but there is also
the uneven quality we have come to associate with performance at the
workshop level." The play, "Come Slowly Eden," earned three Drama
Critics Awards.</TE>
<TE>   When Jackson started his theater, which had several locations over
the years, Actors' Equity excused small theaters from union
membership only if they limited productions to nine performances and
charged no admission.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1972, he helped prevent union plans to scrap workshop
waivers entirely.</TE>
<TE>   He produced more than 125 plays over 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   As an actor, Jackson had small roles in plays in New York and in
such films as "The Young Savages" and "W.C. Fields and Me."</TE>
<TE>   Under his real name, David Dreis, he edited and published a
quarterly book review magazine called Rapport.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 34 years, Marta Dreis.</TE>

<HD>R. De La Fuente Sr., 78; Business Park Innovator, Developer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rocque De La Fuente Sr., a pioneering Latino businessman who built a
family fortune in car dealerships and land on both sides of the
Mexican border, has died in La Jolla. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   De La Fuente, who created the 312-acre Border Business Park at
Otay Mesa south of San Diego, died Sunday of a heart attack at
Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla.</LD>
<LD>   He had largely turned over control of the family enterprises to
his son, Rocque De La Fuente Jr., after suffering a stroke in 1990.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico, the son of an import-export
businessman, De La Fuente dropped out of medical school in Mexico
City to become a car dealer.</TE>
<TE>   He bought surplus U.S. Navy vehicles for $25 at auctions and
resold them in Tijuana for $50. By 1950, he had Porsche and
Volkswagen franchises in Tijuana and Ensenada.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual sideline, De La Fuente built a pontoon toll bridge
at San Luis Rio Colorado, Mexico, to avoid tedious ferry crossings of
the Colorado River. During the five-year duration of his contract
with the Mexican government, he realized a $3,000 daily profit on his
bridge.</TE>
<TE>   When Mexico banned auto imports in 1964, De La Fuente moved north
and obtained San Diego franchises to sell Volkswagens, Porsches,
Cadillacs and Dodges.</TE>
<TE>   He began his vast land acquisitions in the 1960s, when he bought
automobile dealerships in Kearny Mesa. In 1979, he and his son, a
land developer, bought 133 acres in nearby Otay Mesa, and in 1982
bought 4,000 more.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego County condemned 524 acres of the land in 1987 to build
a jail, but 10 years later had to pay Rocque De La Fuente Jr. $38.7
million to settle his litigation over the transaction. Last year, he
won an additional $94.5 million from the city of San Diego in
litigation over development of the family's Border Business Park.</TE>
<TE>   The senior De La Fuente was considered a visionary three decades
ago for beginning an industrial business park to provide an
environment for companies too small to afford their own real estate.
Such complexes are now commonplace.</TE>
<TE>   A cosmopolitan bon vivant who courted politicians in both major
U.S. parties, De La Fuente until 1996 maintained a 7,000-square-foot,
ocean-view mansion in La Jolla, where he hosted political and
charitable fund-raisers. He spoke fluent French as well as Spanish
and English, and enjoyed French wine, Cuban cigars, and quick trips
to France and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   But De La Fuente, known to business associates from Japan to
Germany as "Mr. D.," also enjoyed handing out $20 bills to homeless
people he encountered on the streets of downtown San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Bertha; his
daughter, Bertha De La Fuente; and six grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled Wednesday at The Immaculata, on the
University of San Diego campus.</TE>

<HD>Blood Clots Hospitalize Mahony</HD>
<DH>Health: An embolism is found in the cardinal's lung. A
complete recovery is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Roger M. Mahony was admitted to Providence Saint Joseph
Medical Center in Burbank on Sunday evening for treatment of a
pulmonary embolism--blood clots in his lung.</LD>
<LD>   His physician, Dr. Lee Parsons, said Mahony was in good condition
and resting comfortably Monday. Though he may be in the hospital for
as many as 10 days, he is expected to make a complete recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Tod Tamberg, archdiocese spokesman, said the cardinal was working
from his room.</LD>
<TE>   '"One of the first things he asked for was his computer," Tamberg
said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts speculated that the clots could have been caused by
Mahony's flights to Rome and back last week for the two-day
conference of cardinals on pedophilia.</TE>
<TE>   Prolonged sitting on such flights occasionally causes the
formation of blood clots, or emboli, in the legs. These clots can
then break loose and lodge elsewhere in the body, producing lung
damage, heart attacks and strokes.</TE>
<TE>   This condition is often called "economy-class syndrome," but it
can affect passengers and pilots anywhere on a plane. At least 2,000
Americans each year die from such blood clots after a flight, but
experts said that the vast majority go undiagnosed and that as many
as 1million people worldwide die from them yearly. Former Vice
President Dan Quayle suffered a pulmonary embolism in 1994 after an
overseas flight, but was successfully treated.</TE>
<TE>   The clots do damage by blocking the flow of blood to the affected
organ. In the lungs, that means a patient's blood is not completely
oxygenated, causing breathing difficulties and chest pains.</TE>
<TE>   Although pulmonary emboli cause as many as 650,000 deaths in the
United States annually, said Dr. Craig Feied of George Washington
University, the vast majority of those occur in the first hour after
symptoms begin or in patients in which the disorder is never
diagnosed. Once a patient is diagnosed and hospitalized for
treatment, deaths are rare.</TE>
<TE>   Treatment includes bed rest and the use of clot-busting enzymes to
destroy the initial clot and blood thinners to prevent the formation
of more clots.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony was successfully treated in 1998 for a blood clot in his
right lung that he developed after prostate surgery. Such clots are
common among hospitalized patients and after surgery.</TE>

<HD>Oreste Piccioni, 86; Leader in the Field of Subatomic
Physics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oreste Piccioni, a leader in the field of elementary particle physics
and emeritus professor at UC San Diego, has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Piccioni died April 13 at his home in Rancho Santa Fe of
complications from diabetes and lung cancer, family members said.</LD>
<LD>   "He was a brilliant and creative genius," said Thomas M. O'Neill,
a former chairman of the physics department at UC San Diego. "In
terms of physics accomplishments, [he] was one of the top early
elementary particle physicists in the world."</LD>
<TE>   A native of Italy, Piccioni earned his doctorate at the University
of Rome in 1938, studying under the renowned physicist Enrico Fermi.</TE>
<TE>   During the Allied advance in Italy during World War II, Piccioni
attempted to flee Axis occupation, but was captured by Nazi troops
and held in a prisoner of war camp until a friend bought his release.</TE>
<TE>   Piccioni came to the United States in 1946 and continued his
research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brookhaven
National Laboratory in New York and the European Organization for
Nuclear Research, known as CERN.</TE>
<TE>   Piccioni contributed to some of the leading work in physics in the
last 60 years.</TE>
<TE>   While at the Roman university during World War II, he and his
colleagues used makeshift vacuum tubes to test a newly discovered
particle then known as the mesotron.</TE>
<TE>   The experiment, conducted in the basement of an Italian high
school, was to test the prevailing scientific theory that the
mesotron was the carrier of the strong force holding the nuclei of
atoms together.</TE>
<TE>   Piccioni's experiment, however, proved that mesotrons were not the
connective force in the nuclei.</TE>
<TE>   While at Brookhaven, Piccioni visited the Lawrence Livermore Lab
run by UC Berkeley and conferred with Owen Chamberlin and Emilio
Segre, offering suggestions on their work that led to the discovery
of antiprotons in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   Several years later, Chamberlin and Segre were awarded the Nobel
Prize in Physics for their antiproton discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Piccioni maintained that he had made important contributions to
their work and, in 1972, filed a civil suit against the two
scientists, seeking $125,000 in damages and a public acknowledgment
of the importance of his contributions. A court dismissed the suit,
however, after ruling that it had been filed too late.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he was awarded the Matteucci Medal from the Accademia
Nazionale Delle Scienze of Italy for his seminal contributions to
particle physics.</TE>
<TE>   Piccioni is survived by his wife, Marina; five children; and four
grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>A Superior Court judge who ruled last year that a common method for
assessing property taxes is unconstitutional indicated Monday that he
is worried government workers have been wrongly advising taxpayers
against filing for refunds.</LD>
<LD>   In a hearing, Judge John M. Watson said if people were told that
filing for a refund would be futile, it would rob them of the only
way to fight their tax bill.</LD>

<LD>Residents were jubilant Monday after Orange County ordered grading
halted at a youth detention camp where bulldozers had cleared at
least four acres of oaks and coastal sage without state and federal
permits.</LD>
<LD>   County probation officials initially said they had sufficient
permits from the county. But residents said the area was potential
habitat for endangered or threatened species, and grading would
require permits from the state Department of Fish and Game and the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</LD>

<HD>O.C. Parish Loses 2nd Priest to Abuse Reports</HD>
<DH>Religion: In Dana Point, clergyman is on leave after past
molestation is alleged. San Bernardino diocese ousts two clerics
after similar accusations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parishioners at St. Edward Church, already stunned by allegations
that their former pastor impregnated a teenage girl and paid for her
abortion 20 years ago, received another shock over the weekend when a
second priest was removed from the Dana Point parish over accusations
of sex abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Father Denis Lyons, who was two months' shy of retirement, was
placed on paid administrative leave Friday after accusations were
made last week that he had molested a young teenage boy two decades
ago.</LD>
<LD>   The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange forwarded the information to
the Costa Mesa police and provided no other information on the case
publicly.</LD>
<TE>   Lyons, 68, couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Diocesan officials also disclosed that Lyons had admitted in 1993
to "inappropriate behavior" with two men while serving as pastor of
St. John the Baptist in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1994, the parents of two brothers complained to the
diocese that Lyons had molested their sons, who were 14 and 16 at the
time, around 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Both times, church officials said, they sent Lyons for "extensive
counseling," including an eight-month stay at an out-of-state
treatment center after the second set of allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Lyons didn't qualify under the diocese's new "one strike" policy
for removing priestly sex offenders because the allegations involving
the two brothers couldn't be proved, a church official said.</TE>
<TE>   Church spokeswoman Maria Schinderle said Lyons showed excellent
results in psychological evaluations, which contributed to the
decision to keep him in ministry. The priest had been at St. Edward
since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in San Bernardino, one Roman Catholic priest has
resigned and another has been placed on a leave of absence after that
diocese recently revealed allegations they had abused children.</TE>
<TE>   Parishioners were told of the allegations and the diocese's
response in weekend Masses.</TE>
<TE>   Father Peter Covas, 70, of St. Peter and St. Paul Catholic Church
in Rancho Cucamonga resigned Friday, also two months before his
planned retirement, said Father Howard Lincoln, a spokesman for the
San Bernardino diocese.</TE>
<TE>   And the San Bernardino bishop, Gerald Barnes, placed Msgr. Peter
Luque of St. Edward parish on indefinite leave. One complaint has
been made against each priest, Lincoln said.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations in that diocese surfaced last week after a panel
of priests and laypeople reviewed about 400 files on priests going
back 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes formed the panel in response to the sex abuse scandal that
has shaken the Roman Catholic Church nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the diocese turned over 22 allegations against 20
priests to San Bernardino police. The first offense is alleged to
have occurred in 1957, the most recent in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 20 priests, four have died, one left the country and 11 are
retired or no longer work in the diocese.</TE>
<TE>   The four remaining priests were still in active ministry as of
Friday. Two of those are retired, so-called supply priests who fill
in at parishes when needed. Lincoln would not name them. The other
two are Luque and Covas.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln declined to address the nature of the allegations against
those two priests, though he did say they go back "several years,"
before both joined their most recent parishes.</TE>
<TE>   "There are children at [the most recent] parishes, and we have had
absolutely no report whatsoever of any inappropriate conduct,"
Lincoln said.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino Police Lt. Frank Mankin said most of the alleged
offenses were in San Bernardino and Riverside counties but some were
in Los Angeles and San Diego counties. And "there were some
allegations that were reported to have taken place in Missouri,
Indiana and Massachusetts," he added.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Reflects, Looks to City's Future</HD>
<DH>Legacy: Breaking ground for a project and complaints that
nothing has changed greet the anniversary of the 1992 unrest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. CONNIE KANG and KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles marked the anniversary of the 1992 riots on Monday with
joyful multicultural celebrations and promises to work toward ethnic
harmony--but also with bitter reflections on the causes of the civil
unrest.</LD>
<LD>   With ceremonies, concerts, exhibits, speeches and picket signs,
residents considered the meaning of the violence that followed the
acquittal 10 years ago of LAPD officers accused of beating motorist
Rodney King--and on progress made in the decade since.</LD>
<LD>   What is right with Los Angeles as well as what is wrong were both
in evidence in events at the corner of Florence and Normandie
avenues, epicenter of the unrest.</LD>
<TE>   Even as a group of classical musicians and activists from African
American, Latino and Korean communities expressed their hopes for
ethnic harmony, critics charged that these efforts don't touch the
deeper problems facing their community.</TE>
<TE>   "This is [just] Hollywood," said Howard Mack, a neighborhood
resident who works for a telephone company, as he watched on the
sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing has changed,'' he said. "Why don't you come here at 6
o'clock, when the sun goes down, and see reality?"</TE>
<TE>   Mack, along with several others, heatedly charged that despite
promises of redevelopment, his neighborhood hasn't seen any
improvement.</TE>
<TE>   But Rod Norris, a resident who lives four blocks from the
intersection, said he was deeply moved by the event, which included
the lighting of a "unity candle" and people joining hands to observe
30 seconds of silence to mark the 10th anniversary of the beginning
of three days of civil unrest that shook the city.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so beautiful," said Norris, an X-ray technician. "The
music brought a sense of unity that I haven't seen in a while."</TE>
<TE>   Three violinists--Ron Clark, who is black; Jesus Florido, a
Latino; and Chan-Ho Yun, a Korean American--played Pachelbel's Canon,
mesmerizing onlookers in a lot in front of a liquor store at the
northeast corner.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is the leader city in the U.S. with all these
cultures in one place," said Florido, an immigrant from Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   "What better way to bring people together than through music?"</TE>
<TE>   Yun, a violin teacher at Colburn School of Performing Arts, also
helped organize a 500-member interracial children's choir that was
scheduled to perform later Monday at Praises of Zion Baptist Church.</TE>
<TE>   "Our focus should be on children," said Loretta Jones, executive
director of Healthy African American Families, an organizer of the
event.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the ones who will make a difference. Adults don't seem to
be ready to take [it] on. But children will [do] anything together."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in South-Central, community leaders held a
groundbreaking ceremony for an $11-million commercial development on
the southwest corner of Vermont and Slauson that will include a
supermarket and a Burger King. The supermarket, expected to open in
late November, will be one of four L.A. outlets of the Mexican-owned
Gigante chain.</TE>
<TE>   The project is spearheaded by the Vermont Slauson Economic
Development Corp., assisted by the Los Angeles Community Development
Bank and others.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at Monday's ceremony, Councilwoman Jan Perry called the
preparations leading up to the project "long and tortuous."</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to have any problems, because we need this
project," she said, adding that she did not expect the city to put
any impediments in its way.</TE>
<TE>   Also in South-Central, 80 activists gathered at Western and
Slauson to protest the continuing presence of liquor stores, seen as
an emblem of economic exploitation of the community.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Bass, executive director of the Community Coalition, said
her organization has in the years since the riots prevented many
liquor stores from reopening. But she blamed the city attorney's
office, building and safety authorities and the zoning administrator
for not acting forcefully enough to shut down others.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Opposes Suit to Channel Water to Salmon</HD>
<DH>Environment: Justice Department files court papers backing
Klamath River Basin farmers, who fear losing their supply to the
fish.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration moved vigorously Monday to block a court bid
by fishermen and environmentalists to protect young coho salmon,
contending that increased flows in the Klamath River would come at
the expense of upstream farmers and wildlife.</LD>
<LD>   Justice department lawyers argue in papers filed in U.S. District
Court in Oakland that there is insufficient proof that the coho would
benefit if more water is sent down the river during April and May to
California's North Coast.</LD>
<LD>   "If the flows plaintiffs demand were to be implemented now, the
consequences would be severe to upstream resources," the papers
state.</LD>
<TE>   The government is responding to a lawsuit filed last week by the
Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Assns. and six environmental
groups. The suit seeks to provide more water to the young salmon
during the spring, when tiny "fry" seek refuge along riverbanks and
year-old coho salmon move downstream to the sea.</TE>
<TE>   It also takes the unusual step of asking a judge to move
immediately to increase flows to the fish, even if that means cutting
water deliveries to farmers.</TE>
<TE>   The environmentalists' request for a court order has heightened
year-old tensions over who deserves water in the Klamath River Basin,
an issue that last summer sparked a virulent water war in the West.</TE>
<TE>   This summer promised to be more peaceful, with the basin receiving
substantially more water from rain and snowfall than it did during
last year's drought.</TE>
<TE>   But the area remains one of the nation's key battlegrounds in a
fight over the Endangered Species Act, with many farmers lambasting
the law for putting the welfare of fish before that of people.</TE>
<TE>   An expert in environmental law said Monday that the type of order
requested by fishermen and environmentalists is typically hard to
obtain.</TE>
<TE>   "Plaintiffs have a heavy burden of proof," said Michael Bean, an
attorney specializing in endangered species issues at the nonprofit
Environmental Defense.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's stand on how to divide water between
farmers and fish rests largely on an interim report from a panel of
the National Academy of Sciences. This winter, the group found fault
with some of the methodology used by federal wildlife regulators to
justify protecting salmon and other rare fish.</TE>
<TE>   But another environmental law expert, Dan Tarlock, of Chicago-Kent
College of Law, questioned whether the scientific panel's findings
will carry sufficient weight in court. The group has no formal
jurisdiction under the Endangered Species Act and it focused more on
upriver issues, rather than those downstream where the salmon live.</TE>
<TE>   "There are vulnerabilities there," Tarlock said.</TE>
<TE>   Supporting the government's action Monday were lawyers for the
region's farmers, who recalled the devastation to their crops when
water was withdrawn last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The survivors of 2001 have returned to their lives. Crops are in
the ground, being watered, and there is hope," wrote attorneys for
the Klamath Water Users Assn. "Dissatisfied, plaintiffs seek to put a
stop to a community's recovery."</TE>
<TE>   In their original lawsuit, commercial fishermen and
environmentalists represented by Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund
cited the coho's protected status under the Endangered Species Act.
The designation requires federal agencies to take special steps to
keep the species from extinction.</TE>
<TE>   That led federal officials last year to virtually cut off water to
1,200 farmers served by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Klamath
irrigation project. In the midst of a record drought, many farmers
joined in anti-government protests while others were forced to file
for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   This year, farmers hoped that the water would continue to flow
after the National Academy panel criticized regulators.</TE>

<LD>Manteca, Merced and other small towns in the San Joaquin Valley that
formerly were exempt from strict smog-reduction regulations now will
face the same rules as the rest of the valley.</LD>
<LD>   Small-town officials will implement Smog Check II regulations
starting Wednesday to help the valley come closer to meeting federal
air quality standards, said Tom Jordan, an air quality planner with
the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District.</LD>
<LD>   Under original state rules, only urban areas with populations of
100,000 or more were subject to Smog Check II, Jordan said. The law
later was changed to add cities with populations of 50,000 or more.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council today will consider an ordinance requiring
homeowners to landscape their yards. If it passes, it would be the
first such law in California, officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal would require frontyards to be covered with living
plants or decorative materials, such as rocks, bark or gravel.</LD>
<LD>   A recent survey found that more than 6,700 properties in the city
would not meet the requirements. City officials and neighborhood
groups say they will work with people who can't afford the
landscaping, possibly providing grants for home improvements.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal also would make it difficult for residents to park
their motor homes, campers, trailers and boats on their lots, asking
them instead to put the vehicles in storage or in their backyards.</TE>

<LD>The nonnative deer population is growing, and authorities are
discussing shooting herds to keep the numbers under control. If
nothing is done, biologists are concerned the deer may overwhelm
native deer and elk for food and water.</LD>
<LD>   Until 1994, the deer population was kept in check by shooting done
by park officials. The meat was sold to San Quentin prison and
organizations that feed the needy.</LD>
<LD>   Money made from meat sales essentially paid to keep the herds in
check. But when the prison and organizations stopped buying the meat,
there was no money left to fund the shooting of the animals.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Tawney Kitaen pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of
domestic violence against her husband, Cleveland Indians pitcher
Chuck Finley. The plea was entered by her attorney in Superior Court
in Laguna Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Kitaen, 40, who appeared in "Bachelor Party" and "California
Girls," was not present when her attorney, Blair Berk, made the plea.
Superior Court Judge Pamela L. Iles set a June 3 pretrial hearing on
two misdemeanor charges of corporal injury to a spouse and battery.</LD>
<LD>   Police who responded to the couple's Newport Beach home April 1
said they saw cuts and bruises on Finley, who used to pitch for the
Anaheim Angels.</LD>
<TE>   Berk declined to comment Monday on reports that Kitaen had checked
into a treatment program that deals with addiction to prescription
medication for depression and migraine headaches.</TE>
<TE>   A maximum sentence for the two charges would be one year in jail
and $6,000 in fines.</TE>
<TE>   Finley, 39, filed for divorce on April 4 and obtained a temporary
restraining order preventing Kitaen from seeing him. He also received
temporary custody of their daughters, ages 9 and 3.</TE>

<LD>Six people remain hospitalized from injuries suffered in a Placentia
train crash last week that killed two people and injured 186,
Metrolink officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Kube, 59, of Moreno Valley and Lawrence Sorensen, 48, of
Riverside died from blunt-trauma injuries sustained in the April 23
head-on crash between a Metrolink commuter train and a Burlington
Northern Santa Fe freight train.</LD>
<LD>   A memorial service, attended by more than 350 people, was held for
Kube on Sunday at Moreno Valley Christian Fellowship Church. Kube, a
devout Christian with a passion for baseball, was buried Monday in
Riverside.</LD>
<TE>   He is survived by wife, Ann, and daughters Kelly, 22, and Krystle,
17.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the injuries consisted of bruises and scratches.</TE>
<TE>   Some commuters pushed out windows to escape from the wreck, while
rescuers pulled out the more seriously injured. Many of their
injuries included fractures, rib and back injuries and cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink conductor Patrick Phillips, who said that he flew
through the air after the impact and landed on the other side of the
lead car, was treated and released at a local hospital on the day of
the crash, but tests later revealed that he had suffered a brain
hemorrhage.</TE>
<TE>   The 49-year-old Riverside resident continues to suffer severe
headaches, double vision and numbness, his attorney said.</TE>

<HD>High Court Says Seniority Trumps Disability in Job
Placement</HD>
<DH>Labor: Justices, by a 5-4 margin, limit the reach of
anti-discrimination law for the third time in recent years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Disabled employees who say they need a less-demanding job generally
do not have a right to bump workers with more seniority, the Supreme
Court ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-4 ruling resolves a conflict created by the Americans with
Disabilities Act, the 1990 law that said workers with a physical or
mental impairment have a right to work so long as they can do so with
a "reasonable accommodation" by their employers.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the law said this accommodation must not put an
"undue burden" on the employer.</LD>
<TE>   Employers say they should not have to bump more-senior workers in
favor of a disabled employee, and the Supreme Court largely agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "In our view, the seniority system will prevail in the run of
cases," wrote Justice Stephen G. Breyer for the court. "Ordinarily,
the ADA does not require . . . an employer to assign a disabled
employee to a particular position even though another employee is
entitled to that position under the employer's established seniority
system."</TE>
<TE>   But there are exceptions to this general rule, Breyer added. If,
for example, seniority is not generally followed in assigning jobs,
an employer cannot rely on the seniority system as a reason for
refusing to place a disabled employee there, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's ruling is the third in the last few years to limit the
reach of the ADA.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the court ruled that employees with treatable
diseases or medical conditions, such as diabetes or extremely high
blood pressure, are not disabled, even if they are fired because of
these impairments.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the court said the hundreds of thousands of workers
with carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive-stress injuries
generally are also not disabled, as long as they can carry on the
ordinary tasks of daily life.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's ruling concerned the case of an airport cargo handler,
Robert Barnett, who was deemed disabled in 1992 because of a back
injury. Shortly after the ADA was passed, most lawyers and disability
rights experts assumed that its broad anti-bias provisions covered
any worker with a serious physical or mental impairment.</TE>
<TE>   Based on that understanding, Barnett sued US Airways because it
refused to reassign him to the mail room. He had hurt his back while
working at San Francisco International Airport, and his doctor said
he would have to avoid heavy lifting.</TE>
<TE>   When Barnett sought the job in the mail room, his supervisor said
two other workers with greater seniority had also sought transfers to
the mail room, and that they had first bids on those jobs. As an
alternative, Barnett asked that he be given special lifting equipment
in the cargo area.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways refused both suggestions. Barnett was placed on injured
status and eventually lost his job.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Barnett sued the airline for discrimination, claiming
that it had failed to make a "reasonable accommodation" for his
disability as required by law.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge ruled for the airline and said it need not waive
its seniority system in favor of a disabled employee. To do so would
put an "undue hardship" on the employer, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett appealed; the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals revived
his case and said it should go to a jury. His request to be
reassigned to the mail room was reasonable, the appeals court said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies are loath to fight job discrimination cases before
juries, and US Airways appealed to the Supreme Court. Its lawyers
argued that seniority systems govern job assignments generally and
that equal treatment for disabled employees does not entitle them to
preferential treatment.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Supreme Court split virtually down the middle on
the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The five justices in the majority sided with US Airways in saying
that seniority usually rules, but they left open a chance for
employees to show that the employer does not always follow a system
of seniority transfers.</TE>
<TE>   The dissenters split into two camps.</TE>
<TE>   Justices David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg took a more
liberal stand, saying the law gives disabled employees a right to a
"reasonable accommodation."</TE>
<TE>   Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, taking the
conservative side, said disabled employees are not entitled to
preferences over senior workers.</TE>
<TE>   Scalia also faulted Breyer for setting out a muddled,
middle-ground position. The court has made the law into "a
standardless grab bag" from which claims "can be resolved only by
constant litigation," Scalia said.</TE>
<TE>   As if to confirm his point, the case, US Airways vs. Barnett,
00-1250, now goes back to the 9th Circuit for further consideration.</TE>

<LD>They say it's done, or all but done. I still won't believe Jerry West
is running the Memphis Grizzlies until I see him standing in front of
the microphone, his shadow falling across the Grizzlies' logos on the
backdrop at a news conference.</LD>
<LD>   They say that's supposed to happen today.</LD>
<LD>   And part of me wonders if this day hasn't been in the works since
a memorable news conference three years ago, when West stood at a
podium in a Beverly Hills hotel and introduced Phil Jackson as the
new coach of the Lakers.</LD>
<TE>   It's as good a place to start as any, because this isn't a simple
story. It never is with West.</TE>
<TE>   Why would West leave L.A. for Memphis? Why would he give up a
part-time gig collecting rings with the best team in the NBA for a
team that was only two victories better than Chicago and Golden
State, the worst the association could put out there? Don't look for
rational explanations, because greatness isn't always easily
explained.</TE>
<TE>   The great ones think differently from you and me. It's almost a
requirement of genius--no matter what the field--that there's a
little eccentricity thrown in the mix. If West has his quirks, just
be glad they aren't truly whacked out, like cutting off his ear.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think anyone in the front office was philosophically
opposed to the idea of West coming back to the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   His successor, Mitch Kupchak, would have handed the reins back to
West--because he sure wouldn't want to be known as the guy who
blocked Jerry's return.</TE>
<TE>   Partial ownership and financial compensation might be a different
story.</TE>
<TE>   But why did West have to come back to the Lakers? If he couldn't
enjoy the championship meals he cooked, if he couldn't even bring
himself to watch the crowning games, then what was the point?</TE>
<TE>   What more could he do? How could he measure progress? Why not take
on the challenge of rebuilding a team from practically the beginning?</TE>
<TE>   You can only compare the greats with the greats. I see West coming
back to the NBA and I think of Michael Jordan. Then I think of the
common figure between them: Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Why would Jordan, the greatest winner of his era, want to
associate himself with the Washington Wizards, a franchise that
trails even the Clippers in playoff victories (two to zero) since
1989? Yet he cut any remaining ties with the Chicago Bulls and hooked
up with the Wizards because they made the right pitch to him to be
team president and join the ownership group two years ago. He had to
prove himself all over again.</TE>
<TE>   These guys like that. They need that.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's days as a Chicago Bull came to a halt because they didn't
bring back Jackson to coach after the team's 1998 championship, their
sixth in eight years together. Jackson was gone and so was Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   But did Jackson's arrival in Los Angeles a year later pave the way
for West to leave?</TE>
<TE>   It had to hurt him to see Jerry Buss write the big checks to
Jackson with such ease after West had to go through the retirement
game to wring some extra dollars out of him. Later, he felt
threatened that Jackson's relationship with Jeanie Buss created a
conflict of interest and could disrupt the organization.</TE>
<TE>   Pile those onto the notorious worrier's health issues and it was
too much. He went off into semiretirement, popping in from time to
time as a consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson or West? That's a difficult choice for any franchise. It's
also tough to imagine any franchise handing out $5 million apiece to
two guys in suits, and that is Jackson's going rate and the rumored
amount for West to head to Memphis. Jerry Buss couldn't give each his
fair due.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers wouldn't be where they are today without both. And if
gaining Jackson meant losing West, it was worth it in the short term.</TE>
<TE>   West is the single most valuable person to the franchise since it
moved to Los Angeles. He established a standard of playing
excellence, starring for the L.A. Lakers' first championship team,
then helped assemble the next seven champions. He managed the
transition from the Showtime era to the current squad with minimal
downtime, by bringing Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant into town in
one glorious summer six years ago, building the foundation for this
current mini-dynasty.</TE>
<TE>   But Jackson brought stability to this group. That's one thing not
even West could do--not with his annual threats to retire.</TE>
<TE>   The five-year, $30-million commitment Jerry Buss made to Jackson
meant the players couldn't depose him and couldn't dump the blame on
him if things didn't pan out. He wasn't going anywhere. The six
championship rings he brought from Chicago meant his words carried
weight.</TE>
<TE>   He brought out inspired play--particularly from O'Neal--in his
first season, then they all somehow managed to endure the 2000-01
season. He forced the Lakers to trust one another, rely on each
other, and that's how they've arrived at their current state, winners
of 19 of their last 20 postseason games.</TE>
<TE>   West still made contributions from beyond the office--including a
chat with Bryant that helped him get with the program and play a more
team-oriented game.</TE>
<TE>   But this hasn't been about only two people. No one achieves
success by himself in the NBA. So just as some of the credit has to
go to Jackson's assistant coaches, we must stop and acknowledge the
role West's underlings have played in talent acquisition. Kupchak and
Ronnie Lester have made their contributions--and have benefited from
years at West's side. They're part of West's legacy to this team.</TE>
<TE>   And for West's next act? It's not that bad of a base. Two members
of the Grizzlies were just named to the NBA's all-rookie team: Shane
Battier and Pau Gasol, the rookie of the year.</TE>
<TE>   And Memphis just got the basketball executive of the century.</TE>

<HD>Royals Fire Muser After Win at Detroit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Muser became the fourth manager fired during this season when
the Kansas City Royals dismissed him Monday night following another
slow start.</LD>
<LD>   The Royals (8-15) haven't had a winning record since the
strike-shortened 1994 season. Muser went 317-431 (.424) since taking
over the team in the middle of 1997.</LD>
<LD>   "These things happen," Muser said. "I'm not ashamed. I did the
best I could possibly do."</LD>
<TE>   Muser was told of the firing by General Manager Allard Baird in a
"very, very emotional" conversation after the team beat the Tigers,
4-0, at Detroit behind Jeff Suppan's two-hitter. Muser was in the
final year of his contract.</TE>
<TE>   Three other managers have been fired during the season: Phil
Garner by Detroit on April 9, Davey Lopes by Milwaukee on April 18
and Buddy Bell by Colorado April 26.</TE>
<TE>   Boston fired Joe Kerrigan during spring training.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals held a meeting before Monday's game and Muser managed
the team before being ejected in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Muser's tenure, the Royals had among the lowest
payrolls in baseball and struggled with poor pitching. The Royals
began the season with a $47.3-million payroll, eighth-lowest in
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals, who have traded many of their best players in recent
years, are second-to-last in the AL with a 5.58 earned-run average
and 12th in runs with 104.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Royals ended a scoreless tie on Jeff Weaver's wild
pitch in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Suppan (2-3) walked one and struck out three for his third career
shutout.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 5, Boston 3--Rodrigo Lopez shut down the Red Sox for
five innings, and Geronimo Gil and Melvin Mora homered to lead the
Orioles at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Baltimore's eighth victory in 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez (3-0) gave up only one hit through five innings. A former
reliever, Lopez ran into trouble in the sixth when Boston scored two
runs on three hits and a walk. He went 52/3 innings, giving up two
runs, four hits and two walks, and struck out one.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Julio pitched the ninth for his fourth save.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 3, Tampa Bay 2--Eric Milton rebounded from a rough start
with 71/3 strong innings and Denny Hocking hit two sacrifice flies
for the Twins at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay, which had won 12 of its last 15 against Minnesota
before Monday, lost its fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Milton (4-2) gave up six hits, a walk and two runs, and struck out
three. He gave up eight runs in 41/3 innings in a 9-1 loss to the
Devil Rays last week.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Guardado pitched a perfect ninth for his ninth save in nine
chances.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Palmeiro Has Become Valuable Commodity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel outfielder Orlando Palmeiro is always there.</LD>
<LD>   He was there when Jim Edmonds was getting injured diving for fly
balls and crashing into walls. He was there when center fielder Darin
Erstad got injured diving for fly balls and crashing into walls.</LD>
<LD>   "That's a tough role to fill," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "It's
not as physically taxing as playing everyday. But being prepared
every day, just in case you are playing, is tough."</LD>
<TE>   Palmeiro has managed to do that the last four seasons with the
Angels. He has played in at least 104 games the last three. Last
week, he filled in for Erstad, who suffered a mild concussion diving
to make a catch April 19.</TE>
<TE>   He had a six-game hitting streak and scored eight runs in the
seven games that Erstad sat out. Palmeiro also played flawlessly in
left field--Garret Anderson had been moved over to Erstad's spot in
center. "My role here is I have to be prepared to play every day,"
Palmeiro said. "When someone needs a day off or can't do the job
because they are injured, I'm out there. That's why I'm here."</TE>
<TE>   Palmeiro's downside is that he works well as a short-term
replacement but his production tends to tail off as an everyday
player. For brief periods, though, he is an effective leadoff-type
batter, working deep into counts. "He is good in that role because he
works at it," Coach Joe Maddon said. "He is always prepared for
whatever situation he gets put into, which is why he is so good at
this role."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Things happened in reverse for Angel shortstop David Eckstein over
the weekend. He was hit by a pitch in his first at-bat Friday then
had grand slams in consecutive games. Usually, it's the other way
around.</TE>
<TE>   And Eckstein does more than provide occasional power. A former
second baseman, he has become increasingly effective as a shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have turned 28 double plays--five in the last two
games--the second most in the American League. Eckstein started one
double play and was the pivot on another to get the Angels out of
jams Sunday. "Eck has worked really hard at that part of the game,"
Scioscia said. "He and [second baseman] Adam [Kennedy] have really
improved how they turn that play at second base."</TE>

<HD>Tendinitis Is Diagnosis for Pettitte's Arm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Yankee pitcher Andy Pettitte was diagnosed Monday with
tendinitis in his left elbow but a test didn't detect any structural
damage.</LD>
<LD>   Pettitte, on the disabled list since April 21, threw 15 pitches in
the bullpen Sunday in Seattle and still felt pain, then went to
Birmingham, Ala., to see Dr. James Andrews, who conducted an MRI
exam.</LD>
<LD>   Yankee General Manager Brian Cashman said the 29-year-old
left-hander will rest a few days, then continue his rehabilitation
program. If the pain disappears, Pettitte could be sent to the minor
leagues for a rehabilitation assignment in about two weeks.</LD>
<TE>   "When you send someone to Dr. James Andrews, out of all the
possible diagnoses, this would be the one you would want," Cashman
said. "There's a whole bunch of stuff you wouldn't want."</TE>
<TE>   Pettitte was limited by elbow soreness to two spring training
starts and was 1-1 with a 3.09 earned-run average in three starts
this season before going on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Lilly, who made two starts in place of Pettitte, pitched a
one-hitter Saturday night, a 1-0 loss to the Mariners. Sterling
Hitchcock, who has been on the disabled list since spring training
with a sore back and groin, could be activated this week.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee third baseman Robin Ventura, who had a sore jaw and bruised
neck after colliding Sunday with Seattle shortstop Carlos Guillen,
had X-rays and a CT scan Monday in New York, and both were negative.
His status is day-to-day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Wil Cordero was placed on waivers, for the purpose of
his unconditional release, by the Cleveland Indians, who will have to
pay the rest of his $4-million salary.</TE>
<TE>   Cordero was designated for assignment last week, giving the team
10 days to trade him, put him on waivers or send him outright to the
minor leagues.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Royster will remain manager of the Milwaukee Brewers,
shedding the "interim" title he took when he replaced Davey Lopes, a
high-ranking baseball official said.... The Texas Rangers purchased
the contract of catcher Hector Ortiz from triple-A Oklahoma and
designated right-handed pitcher Dan Miceli for assignment. The club
has 10 days to trade or release Miceli, who has indicated he will not
accept a minor league assignment for Texas.... Minnesota shortstop
Cristian Guzman has irritation in his left kneecap and will have an
MRI test today.... Alan Cockrell was named the Colorado Rockies'
hitting coach and third base coach Rich Donnelly resigned.... Voting
for starters at baseball's All-Star game will include six foreign
countries, with more than 10 million ballots distributed in Canada,
the Dominican Republic, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela.</TE>

<LD>It's a myth that Don Zimmer has a metal plate in his head. He does,
however, have a hole in his head. Four of them, to be exact, but
they're filled with material called tantalum buttons.</LD>
<LD>   His skull was fractured when he was beaned in 1953 as a Dodger
farmhand.</LD>
<LD>   "It pushed my brain to the right, so they drilled three holes on
the left and one on the right [to relieve the pressure from a blood
clot]," the Yankees' 71-year-old bench coach told Tom FitzGerald of
the San Francisco Chronicle.</LD>
<TE>   "If anybody thinks I act goofy, I've got an excuse."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Laker record for steals in a playoff
game?</TE>
<TE>   Ho, ho ho: Offensive tackle Mike Williams of Texas, drafted by
Buffalo with the fourth pick overall, has a sense of humor to go with
his gargantuan size, 6 feet 6 and 375 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "When I get on the field, I like to punish people," he said. "It
feels great. You just grab [someone] and you've got him. You look in
his eyes and he's like, 'Oh, please, let me go. I'll never do it
again.' And I say, 'Oh, no, no. You're going down.'"</TE>
<TE>   Cut-up guy: Michael Doleac, the Cleveland Cavaliers' free-agent
center, is going back to the University of Utah this summer to get
his biology degree.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm taking a course in wilderness medicine and human dissection
[of cadavers]," he said. "That should be cool. It's kind of morbid.
But it's a good way to learn. You don't want to practice on someone
who is alive."</TE>
<TE>   His Waterloo: Bud Geracie in the San Jose Mercury News: "With the
23rd pick in the NFL draft, [Oakland Raider owner] Al Davis fell
victim to his Napoleon complex: McCallum in '86, Kaufman in '95 and
now Harris in 2002."</TE>
<TE>   Foul guy: Sacramento King guard Bobby Jackson on Greg Ostertag,
7-2 center of the Utah Jazz: "He's the biggest hacksaw artist in the
league. He looks at you and it's a foul. I mean, call something on
the guy."</TE>
<TE>   Long way away: Mike Bianchi in the Orlando Sentinel: "Did you see
where the Hubble telescope just underwent massive repairs?
Supposedly, it's so strong now that it can see the end of the NBA
playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Overqualified: From the Caught on the Fly column in the Sporting
News: "So the Grizzlies are aggressively pursuing Jerry West.
Wouldn't that be like hiring Leonardo da Vinci to run an
Etch-a-Sketch?"</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1922, Chicago White Sox rookie
Charlie Robertson became the third modern-era pitcher to throw a
perfect game, beating the Tigers, 2-0, at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1995, Major League Baseball
agreed to a contract with its umpires, ending a lockout that had
extended a week into the regular season and forced the use of
replacement arbiters.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Magic Johnson and Byron Scott, seven each; Johnson
against Portland in 1983 and Scott against Golden State in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Steve Slowly of Texas Christian ran the first leg of
the 800-meter relay Saturday at the Penn Relays. Predictably, he
pulled a muscle and failed to make the baton exchange.</TE>

<LD>   What: "SportsCentury: Oscar De La Hoya"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN, today, 4:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   ESPN is putting the debut of this "SportsCentury" on the big
network rather than ESPN Classic. Controversial Oscar De La Hoya
still has that kind of drawing power.</TE>
<TE>   Channel 9 sportscaster Alan Massengale, among those interviewed
for the show, says, "There is no in-between with Oscar. Either you
think he's 'the Golden Boy' or the devil."</TE>
<TE>   Although De La Hoya was interviewed, and there is some boxing
footage, ESPN, as it usually does with "SportsCentury" profiles,
relies heavily on sportswriters to tell the story.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Kawakami, former Times boxing writer who wrote a book about De
La Hoya and is now with the San Jose Mercury News, appears
throughout. Among other writers interviewed are former Times boxing
writer Earl Gustkey, who covered De La Hoya's early days and now is
retired, and current Times boxing writer Steve Springer.</TE>
<TE>   "Oscar was the meal ticket," Gustkey says. "He was going to bring
out that whole family, and the father saw to it that he did."</TE>
<TE>   Kawakami says, "He doesn't burn to fight. What he burned to do was
please his father."</TE>
<TE>   Springer says, "He once told me he'd give up all his titles and
medals if his father would say he was a great fighter."</TE>
<TE>   This show, however, deals with more than De La Hoya's relationship
with his father, Joel. There's also a lot about his mother Cecilia,
who died of breast cancer in 1991, the year before Oscar won his
Olympic gold medal. Other topics include De La Hoya's womanizing and
his love for the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always thought that Oscar enjoyed being a celebrity more
than he enjoyed being a fighter because celebrity brought him
everything he loved--the women, the invitations to golf courses, the
nightclubs," Kawakami says.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya, who married last October, says, "I've had my ups and
downs in my personal life, but I've finally set my priorities
straight."</TE>
<TE>   Broadcaster Jim Lampley says, "He's finally found a woman who
truly loves him, something that has been missing in his life since
his mother died."</TE>

<HD>Came Home Is Right on Schedule for Derby</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Not many jockeys exercise horses wearing stopwatches, but Chris
McCarron does. McCarron, in fact, has been using a workout watch for
at least 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   On a raw, frigid morning Monday at Churchill Downs, after an
overnight flight from Los Angeles that was delayed because of
equipment problems, McCarron was asked by Paco Gonzalez, the trainer
of Came Home, to work the Santa Anita Derby winner five furlongs.
Gonzalez usually gives specific instructions to his workout riders,
and for this exercise, five days before Saturday's Kentucky Derby, he
wanted McCarron to bring the smallish colt home in 1:01.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting in a hotel coffee shop earlier, only a couple of hours
after his plane had landed, McCarron heard that Proud Citizen,
another Derby contender, had worked five furlongs in a blazing 584/5
seconds. News travels that fast during Derby week. McCarron deduced
from Proud Citizen's time that the Churchill track would be playing
much faster than it was last week, when he made another commute from
California to work Came Home six furlongs in 1:123/5.</LD>
<TE>   A little after 8:30, McCarron, wearing a mustard-yellow
windbreaker, a souvenir from the Santa Anita Derby, got a leg up on
Came Home from Gonzalez. McCarron and the colt paused at the
backstretch gap that leads to the track, the jockey making small talk
with Gonzalez and reporters as he waited his turn. McCarron and
Gonzalez talked about the new safety reins that Came Home was
wearing. McCarron recalled a morning two years ago at Del Mar when
one of his reins snapped, and a horse he was scheduled to work got
loose along the outside fence at a breakneck clip.</TE>
<TE>   "Pow!" McCarron said, harking back to 2000. "My horse took off at
something like 22 [seconds] for the first quarter [of a mile]. It
made it exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Came Home stood in the middle of this small crowd, seemingly happy
to be surrounded.</TE>
<TE>   "He bounced me pretty good when we went around [the shedrow at the
barn]," McCarron said, "but all he does out here is stand with that
back leg cocked."</TE>
<TE>   Came Home finally left for the track. Gonzalez and John Toffan,
one of the colt's owners, climbed several stairs to a topless wooden
platform on the backstretch, beside the glass-enclosed clockers'
booth. The platform was packed with people. Half of the 20 horses
scheduled to run in the Derby had workouts Monday, and rubbernecking
was in high season.</TE>
<TE>   Came Home sprinted past the platform, heading for the five-eighths
pole where the workout would begin. Toffan was dead center with
Churchill's historic twin spires.</TE>
<TE>   When Came Home reached the finish line in the distance, several
unofficial clockers shouted times. Toffan lighted a cigarette. He's
Derby-seasoned, as are his partner Trudy McCaffery, who also owns a
piece of Came Home, and the stolid Gonzalez. They finished third in
the 1991 Derby with Mane Minister, and were third again with Free
House in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Mane Minister also ran third in the Preakness and the Belmont
Stakes, the only horse to finish third in all three Triple Crown
races. Free House was second to Silver Charm in the Preakness, beaten
by a head in one of Pimlico's most memorable runnings, and was third
in the Belmont. So Toffan-McCaffery, with one second and five thirds
in six Triple Crown starts, have earned $535,086 without winning a
race. A flat $2 across-the-board bet on their two horses in the six
races would have netted a profit of $14.50.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter what the [workout] time is," Toffan said as he
headed for the barn. "It's the way he comes out of it. But he sure
looked good doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Back at Barn 25, off the horse, McCarron rolled back his left
sleeve and read his stopwatch. It showed 1:01. Officially, Came
Home's time was 1:003/5.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you can let me brag," he said, smiling. "That's just about
what we were looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Then he smiled again.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I could have set it before we even went out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some other Derby trainers and many handicappers are sacrilegiously
throwing out the Santa Anita Derby winner for this Kentucky Derby.
His winning time for 11/8 miles at Santa Anita was 1:50, slowest for
the race since Candy Spots in 1963, and Came Home's final eighth of a
mile didn't break any clocks either.</TE>
<TE>   "First they said he could only run a mile," Toffan said. "Then
when he won at a mile and an eighth, they said he didn't do it fast
enough."</TE>
<TE>   A fever and a minor stall injury for Came Home at Santa Anita
forced Gonzalez into an irregular workout pattern. At one point, the
colt went 20 days without a workout. Then he tore off a shoe two days
before the Santa Anita Derby, and Gonzalez and his crew had to
feverishly soak the foot in the hours before the race.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know," Toffan said of Came Home, "is that he doesn't make
many bad moves. He's won six out of seven, and all of his wins are by
daylight. We think we've got a good shot. Let them knock him. Maybe
that'll drive his price up."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron, 47, has ridden in the Derby 17 times, winning with
Alysheba in 1987 and Go For Gin in 1994. His first mount, Cojak in
1976, was a 38-1 shot trained by the late Sonny Hine.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a special year in many respects," McCarron said. "My
brother Gregg was also riding in the race, and my dad was there. I
finished sixth, but I vaulted off Cojak just like Angel Cordero or
Frankie Dettori might have done after they'd won a big race. I was
just happy because I had ridden in my first Kentucky Derby."</TE>
<TE>   Hine, standing on the track waiting to talk to McCarron, couldn't
fathom why his jockey was so ecstatic about finishing ahead of only
three horses.</TE>
<TE>   "Sonny Hine, bless him," McCarron said. "He wasn't that happy when
he saw what I did. He was disappointed because I wasn't
disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other Kentucky Derby workouts Monday, there were five-furlong
times of 59 seconds for Blue Burner, 1:01 for Lusty Latin, 1:012/5
for Easy Grades and 1:02 for Saarland. Trainer Steve Asmussen's
horses each worked half a mile, Private Emblem in 483/5 and Windward
Passage in 484/5. At six furlongs, Medaglia d'Oro worked in 1:134/5,
and Sunday Break was clocked in 1:142/5. Sunday Break, short on
earnings in graded stakes, may not be able to run because of an
overcrowded field.</TE>

<LD>The Dodgers are enjoying the view from the top of the National League
West, a perch few would have predicted they'd be occupying after they
were swept by San Francisco in the season-opening series, but their
heads remain clear.</LD>
<LD>   "Being in first place is not significant--they don't give out
trophies on April 30," General Manager Dan Evans said. "The good
thing is that a lot of the things we hoped for in the off-season are
coming true.</LD>
<LD>   "Our pitching has given us the chance to win games, and to me
that's the key. I like the energy, the enthusiasm we showed on the
road trip. We're doing a lot of little things well. When you pitch
well, you usually look good, and we've pitched well."</LD>
<TE>   Dodger starters are 15-7 with a 2.51 earned-run average and closer
Eric Gagne is nine for nine in save opportunities, but pitching isn't
all that has pleased Manager Jim Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   Cesar Izturis turned what appeared to be a routine single into a
hustle double in Sunday's 4-1 victory over the Cubs in the second
game of the Dodgers' doubleheader sweep. Later, Paul Lo Duca doubled
to right and took third when the Cubs threw to the wrong base.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Adrian Beltre made a diving stop of Chris Stynes'
ninth-inning grounder in Game 2 on Sunday, and the Dodgers, who rank
second in the league in fielding percentage, did not commit an error
in their three-game sweep of the Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also have had a better offensive approach, showing
more patience and hitting more balls to the opposite field.</TE>
<TE>   About the only negatives in a 5-1 trip through Pittsburgh and
Chicago were some failed sacrifice bunts, one a botched suicide
squeeze Sunday, and several runners thrown out trying to steal.</TE>
<TE>   "Our aggression on the bases has been tremendous--they're taking
the extra base and forcing the issue," Tracy said. "And defensively,
we're doing as good a job as we've done in the four years I've worn
this uniform. We've gotten great starting pitching, and you have to
feel good about the way we've been able to use the bullpen....We're
building a neat thing here."</TE>
<TE>   Except for Kevin Brown's setback--an elbow injury put him on the
disabled list, but he returns tonight against the Reds--the Dodgers
have not suffered the kind of injury that would sorely test their
depth. Besides Shawn Green, no player has been in a prolonged batting
slump.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get to late May or early June, when you've played a
variety of clubs, and you give the guys who have had slow starts a
chance to come around and see if the guys who started hot can sustain
it, then you'll have a better idea," said first baseman Eric Karros,
batting .333 with 11 runs batted in, one of the best Aprils of his
career. "It's great, what we've seen, but it's early."</TE>
<TE>   Some would say what the Dodgers haven't seen is great. There are
no malcontents in the clubhouse, there's been no bickering, no major
distraction, no general manager getting fired.</TE>
<TE>   The one player with a gripe, pitcher Omar Daal, who is upset about
being sent to the bullpen, hasn't taken his frustrations to the
mound. He went 2-0 with an 0.73 ERA in two starts in Brown's absence.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a group of guys here, [Chairman] Bob Daly, Evans and
Tracy, who have made efforts to get certain types of personalities in
the clubhouse," Karros said.</TE>
<TE>   "But does good chemistry create winning, or does winning create
good chemistry? ... What [good chemistry] allows you to do is focus
more on the field than [on] what's going on off the field."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brown lasted only 11/3 innings before leaving his last start with
his elbow injury April 13, and a relapse could tax the bullpen, but
the Dodgers have not considered a minor league rehabilitation start
or two for their ace.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who suffered a breakup of scar tissue after dialing his
fastball up to 96 mph against the Padres, aired it out during his
last bullpen workout Saturday, and the Dodgers believe that if the
elbow were going to flare up again, it would have done so.</TE>
<TE>   Two other factors went into the decision to start Brown against
Cincinnati tonight: The Dodgers don't want their $15-million pitcher
throwing off a foreign minor league mound, and if Brown has to leave
the game early, the Dodgers can back him up with Daal.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be tough for him to simulate a game-like situation in the
bullpen or a minor league game, because this is a very different guy
from the others you're used to dealing with," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we push him into a rehab start in the wrong frame of mind,
then we might risk injury on a minor league field."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Reliever David Coggin walked in the go-ahead run as the Philadelphia
Phillies blew a five-run lead and lost their sixth consecutive game,
8-5, to the San Francisco Giants on Monday night at San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   With the score tied at 5 in the seventh, Rich Aurilia singled off
Rheal Cormier (1-3) and Barry Bonds walked. Both advanced on catcher
Mike Lieberthal's passed ball before Jeff Kent walked to load the
bases for J.T. Snow.</LD>
<LD>   Aurilia was thrown out at home on Snow's grounder and Reggie
Sanders struck out. But Coggin walked Benito Santiago and the Giants
took the lead. Pedro Feliz also walked to make it 7-5 before David
Bell struck out to finally end it.</LD>
<TE>   Snow added a sacrifice fly in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants, playing before the smallest-ever crowd of 35,136 at
Pacific Bell Park, won their second straight after a four-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Worrell (2-0) pitched one inning in relief for the win. Robb
Nen pitched the ninth for his seventh save.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies (8-18), who walked 10 batters, have lost eight
consecutive road games.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 5-1, the Giants scored four runs in the sixth inning to
tie it.</TE>
<TE>   Kent's home run off Phillies' starter Robert Person scored Bonds,
who singled with one out. Snow scored when Santiago's grounder was
mishandled by second baseman Marlon Anderson on shortstop Jimmy
Rollins' throw. Feliz added an RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies went up 5-0 with a four-run fourth inning. Rollins'
double down the right-field line scored Pat Burrell and Travis Lee,
and Rollins scored on Doug Glanville's double. Glanville scored on
Bobby Abreu's single.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who hit a single-season record 73 homers last season,
hasn't homered since April 17. He has eight home runs this season,
but has been bothered by a sore left hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds needs just one homer to reach 400 as a Giant, joining Willie
Mays, Mel Ott and Willie McCovey as the only players in franchise
history to reach the milestone.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Schmidt was making his second start for the Giants since
returning from the disabled list. He missed the first three weeks of
the season with a groin injury. Schmidt gave up five runs--four
earned --and seven hits in 32/3 innings.</TE>

<HD>Canadiens Enjoy Old Feeling</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Power-play goals by Audette, Perreault lift
Montreal past Boston, 2-1, and to first playoff series victory since
1998.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Of all the many great moments in the Montreal Canadiens' fabled
history, it's doubtful many packed the emotional punch of the 2-1
victory that launched them past the Boston Bruins on Monday and into
the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Compensating with heart for what they lacked in size and depth,
the Canadiens parlayed power-play goals by Donald Audette and Yanic
Perreault, and the acrobatic goaltending of Jose Theodore into the
clincher of a six-game upset of the top-seeded Bruins.</LD>
<LD>   The Molson Centre, dark during the playoffs the last three years,
rocked with noise, passion and 21,273 furiously beating hearts.</LD>
<TE>   "Tonight," said team captain Saku Koivu, seven months removed from
learning he had stomach cancer and nine games into a stirring
comeback, "it's good to be a Montreal Canadien."</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't been the case for many years. The Canadiens, seeded
eighth in the Eastern Conference, hadn't won a playoff series since
1998, when they defeated Pittsburgh in the first round. Their
prospects of ending that streak often seemed grim.</TE>
<TE>   Koivu was ill. Audette was recovering from surgery to repair seven
tendons in his arm. And when their leading scorer, Richard Zednik,
was struck by the elbow of Bruin defenseman Kyle McLaren in Game 4 of
this series and suffered a concussion and facial injuries that put
him in intensive care, they seemed to have exhausted their
resilience.</TE>
<TE>   But like Koivu and Audette, the Canadiens as a team discovered
they had more strength than they knew. Two days after his release
from the hospital, they gave Zednik the best medicine he could have.</TE>
<TE>   "To see him feeling better motivated us to win this series," Koivu
said.</TE>
<TE>   No one was more determined than Theodore.</TE>
<TE>   "After the McLaren hit I was so frustrated," he said. "I told
Richard I would do what I could to win this."</TE>
<TE>   Theodore stopped 34 shots and got help from the left post on a
shot by Martin Lapointe halfway through the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "The ghosts came back," Audette said, referring to the phantoms
often credited with helping the Canadiens win at the Forum, their
home until 1996.</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing supernatural about Monday's game--just rugged,
grinding hockey.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a great series that we just went through," Bruin Coach
Robbie Ftorek said. "A lot of things they worked for and got. A lot
of things we worked for and didn't get. And Theodore played very
well."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Rolston got the Bruins a lead at 7:57 of the first period,
converting his own rebound after Nick Boynton intercepted a clearing
pass by Patrice Brisebois. But the Canadiens pulled even at 13:56,
when Audette's skate deflected a centering pass by Perreault past
Byron Dafoe.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadiens' power play produced the decisive goal 39 seconds
into the third period. Boston's Joe Thornton was serving a double
minor for high-sticking Sheldon Souray when Perreault, with Lapointe
clutching one arm, freed the other to nudge the puck past Dafoe.</TE>
<TE>   "Martin Lapointe had one of my arms, so I tried to use the
strength of my right leg and lift the puck," Perreault said.</TE>
<TE>   He got enough to propel the Canadiens into the second round, where
they will play third-seeded Carolina. That series probably will begin
Friday, giving the Canadiens a few days to savor their improbable
accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "We surprised a lot of people," Coach Michel Therrien said. "We
faced adversity and made the playoffs, and everybody was thinking we
were not going to make the playoffs. But we believed in ourselves....
This is one step for us. To make the playoffs was one step and doing
this was another step."</TE>
<TE>   Said Perreault: "It's been a loud building in this series, and
tonight it was especially loud. It was great to see the fans into it.
People were glad to see us in the playoffs, but this team, we want to
do more."</TE>

<HD>Skating Hearing Called 'Intense'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAUSANNE, Switzerland</DL>
<LD>Before the International Skating Union began a nine-hour hearing into
the Olympic figure skating scandal Monday, the French judge at the
center of the dispute complained she was the victim of "a one-way
hearing, an organized massacre."</LD>
<LD>   The skating judge, Marie-Reine Le Gougne, declined to comment
after coming out of the hearing room, but in an interview in Monday's
edition of the French sports paper L'Equipe, she claimed the case was
stacked against her. One of her attorneys described the opening
session of the two-day, closed-door hearings as "intense."</LD>
<LD>   Le Gougne and French skating boss Didier Gailhaguet were called
before the council to answer charges they manipulated the result of
the pairs competition at the Salt Lake Games.</LD>
<TE>   Le Gougne was suspended indefinitely by the ISU for alleged
misconduct after initially declaring she was instructed by Gailhaguet
to vote for the victorious Russian pair ahead of the Canadians, who
were later awarded duplicate gold medals.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne retracted the accusation against Gailhaguet, saying she
was in emotional distress at the time and had been harassed by ISU
officials into making false claims against him. Gailhaguet has denied
any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Ottavio Cinquanta, the ISU president, said he expected a verdict
tonight and hoped the hearings will prevent further scandals and spur
reforms.</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>While the Colorado Avalanche was at full strength for the first time
since last May, the Kings played their most important game of the
season Monday night without injured regulars Adam Deadmarsh and
Philippe Boucher.</LD>
<LD>   Deadmarsh, a top-line winger, sat out the last three games of the
series after suffering a strained neck in the third period of Game 4
while diving head-first into the end boards trying to check Avalanche
defenseman Adam Foote.</LD>
<LD>   Boucher was sidelined when a shot by Darius Kasparaitis in the
first period of Game 5 caromed off another player and struck him on
his right cheek and eye, resulting in a possible concussion for the
King defenseman.</LD>
<TE>   "Just thinking about it," Boucher said Monday from his home in
Manhattan Beach, where he has spent most of the last four days
resting in bed, "I still hear the noise that it made when it hit my
face and I can almost feel the pain."</TE>
<TE>   He said his eye was fine but that he was suffering from headaches.</TE>
<TE>   Like Boucher, Deadmarsh also stayed home. His neck was too stiff
to allow him to play, Coach Andy Murray said, so the Kings left him
behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Could he play with it? Possibly," Murray said before the game.
"But the problem you have is, when he's like that, his mobility is
really limited and he's open to getting hurt in other areas and we
can't afford to let that happen to him....</TE>
<TE>   "These are important hockey games and we want all our best players
in the lineup, but a person's individual health is our first
priority."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Murray went out to dinner Sunday night with his assistants
and other King personnel, he found a booster seat in his chair--a
good-natured jab after Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley had dismissed
Murray on Saturday, saying, "My parents always taught me not to waste
time with 4-feet-6 guys."</TE>
<TE>   "It was just the guys teasing me," Murray said. "Some of the
players are calling me Shorty and stuff like that. I've had fun with
it. I try not to take things too seriously....</TE>
<TE>   "That's what Bob's parents taught him. My parents taught me to
respect the game and respect your players and to have your own
players respect the opponent. He was taught different things than I
was."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hartley of the feud, "That's part of the game. But today,
where it's such an important game, the focus has to be on the right
things. We're very fortunate we're coaching some world-class
athletes. That's good stuff in between games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Realizing how close they had come to eliminating the Avalanche,
several King players said it was difficult to watch Hartley's team go
on to win the Stanley Cup last year, but Murray didn't mind.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't really make any difference," he said. "I'll be very
honest with you: The most important games I watched after that were
my kids' games. I lost interest."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Ronning, who returned to the King lineup for Game 6 after
sitting out two games because of concussion-like symptoms, was a late
scratch from Game 7. Steve Kelly, who spent most of the season in the
minors, replaced him.</TE>
<TE>   Murray had hinted at the change earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   "We're thinking of adding a player to our lineup tonight to change
the look of things a little bit," he said. "It's not related to an
injury at all."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, a 25-year-old forward, had no goals and one assist in eight
regular-season games with the Kings, the last on Dec. 26.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty-two feet of jump shot later, the Lakers can be world-beaters
again. Whether they are or not is up to the San Antonio Spurs,
assuming the Spurs are the team that steps off the luxury bus beneath
Staples Center on Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Gone for the moment, thanks to Robert Horry's knack for things
dramatic, is the sense the Lakers did not play especially well for
long stretches against the Portland Trail Blazers, particularly late
in Game 2 and then well into Game 3.</LD>
<LD>   Rick Fox plays defense and finds room for a layup, and Kobe Bryant
makes a three-pointer, and then Horry, of course, and once again
Scottie Pippen does some un-Scottie-like things within arm's reach of
Phil Jackson, and so the Lakers are OK again?</LD>
<TE>   Not really, but they're not dwelling on it, either.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt good to do that," Bryant said. "Every time we play
Portland in a playoff series, the next series you feel a lot freer.
You can roam around the floor a lot more. Portland, they're
constantly on you. They're pulling your jersey, they're on your arm,
it makes for a fun series. A tough one, but a fun series."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson watched all the inadequacies of Sunday afternoon melt away
on one last shot, which in 30 seconds reaffirmed that these players
win championships, and thought it remarkable. But, so far, it looks
as though the playoffs will be a grind, whatever teams might be out
there.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to move the ball better and read defenses better,"
Jackson said. "We're not doing that as well as we should.</TE>
<TE>   "The big key for us is, the next series doesn't start until
Sunday. That allows us ample opportunity to prepare ourselves. We
have a pretty good idea about how we played San Antonio last year,
and this year and were relatively successful against them. Seattle,
we also had a 3-1 record against in the course of the year. There are
a lot of things we have to do in the process. I think we'll work our
guys who didn't play a lot in this series and rest the guys that did,
and be prepared about Thursday to start getting into some practices
that matter to us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Magic Johnson has seen a lot of late shots taken by a lot of great
players in the playoffs, and Horry's simply confirmed what Johnson
has felt about him all along.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the top 10-to-15 all-time great playoff players," he
said. "James Worthy is the best I've ever seen, taking his overall
game to another level. But, Robert Horry, as far as taking big shots
and hitting them and wanting to take them, he's one of the top
10-to-15 I've ever seen play.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm serious. A lot of guys talk the talk but don't really want to
do it. Robert Horry definitely wants that ball in that moment and
just has that confidence. He's like a Jerry West in that way. I'm
talking about for that one shot. I'm not talking overall game. But
for that one shot at that one moment, after Jerry and James Worthy,
Kareem, Dr. J, Larry Bird--after you get out of that 10 guys, he's in
that next 10, without a doubt. You can put him up against anybody
after that 10."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On his back beneath the basket late in Sunday's game, Fox was
kicked twice in the head by Trail Blazer center Dale Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Both kicks were subtle, the second with Davis' heel, but both had
a point. Two days earlier, Fox had mimicked Davis' angry walk from
the floor after being ejected from Game 2, to the delight of his
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I get for impersonating him," Fox said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Samaki Walker has a bone bruise on the outside of his left
knee, according to a Laker official. He is day to day, but expected
to be available when the Lakers open their second-round series
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Walker has had occasional pain in his knee for at least two weeks,
but only last Sunday was it severe enough to cause him concern. An
MRI exam Monday revealed the bone bruise.</TE>

<HD>NBA to Review Replay Policy</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of the controversy over a game-winning, buzzer-beating
shot that was waved off in a Charlotte-Orlando playoff game, NBA
Commissioner David Stern said the league plans to discuss using
instant replay in similar situations.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the whole subject has to be looked at, including just
using instant replay," Stern said.</LD>
<LD>   In Saturday's Hornet-Magic game, Charlotte's Baron Davis banked in
a shot that clearly beat the buzzer after the Hornets inbounded the
ball with 0.7 seconds left and the score tied.</LD>
<TE>   Referee Bernie Fryer waved the shot off while it was in the air,
saying the officiating crew had discussed beforehand that no player
could catch, turn and shoot in that amount of time.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets went on to defeat the Magic in overtime, but the
episode showed that the league needs to address its policies
regarding rulings on last-second shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that we've got to do two things: We've got to satisfy our
fans that they can understand what our rules are, and we have to
re-evaluate what human beings can do," Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, you wind up having a standard that says it isn't
humanly possible to do something in less than 0.7 seconds, and then
someone proves that it is, and those are the kinds of protocols that
we use."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Memphis Grizzlies Pau Gasol and Shane Battier topped the voting
for the NBA All-Rookie team. They were joined on the first team by
San Antonio's Tony Parker, Utah's Andrei Kirilenko and Golden State's
Jason Richardson on the squad selected by the NBA's 29 coaches, who
weren't allowed to vote for their own players.... Two high-ranking
members of the NBA players' union said they are opposed to changing
the first-round playoff format from best-of-five to best-of-seven,
although the union and the league are discussing the issue.... Kwame
Brown, the NBA's No. 1 overall draft pick in 2001 by the Washington
Wizards, was arrested in Dublin, Ga., for driving 120 mph. Brown, a
20-year-old forward, was charged Saturday with speeding in a 60 mph
construction zone.</TE>

<HD>Matthews Signs With Redskins</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a surprisingly quick turnabout, Steve Spurrier decided he needed
Shane Matthews after all.</LD>
<LD>   A day after Spurrier said he was happy with his quarterbacks--and
that no major changes were planned--the Washington Redskins agreed to
terms Monday with Matthews, who played for the coach at the
University of Florida and was cut last week by the Chicago Bears.</LD>
<LD>   The signing comes after a three-day minicamp in which none of the
four quarterbacks on the Redskins' practice field seemed on pace for
assuming a starting job in the NFL. Danny Wuerffel, Sage Rosenfels
and Dameyune Craig all struggled at times, and first-round draft pick
Patrick Ramsey did not work much because he's still learning the
offense.</LD>
<TE>   Matthews becomes the fifth ex-Florida player signed since Spurrier
became the Redskins' coach in January.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Eagles, looking for a running back to replace
Correll Buckhalter and probably split time with Duce Staley, brought
in Dorsey Levens for a visit. Buckhalter, expected to play a bigger
role in Philadelphia's offense this season, suffered a season-ending
knee injury on the first day of minicamp Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Vikings decided against re-signing Pro Bowl kicker
Gary Anderson, the NFL's career leading scorer, and signed Doug Brien
to replace him. The Vikings, still trying to find ways to revamp
their running game, also released running back Travis Prentice....
Miami Dolphin defensive tackle Tim Bowens had arthroscopic surgery on
his left knee, his second operation on the knee in less than eight
months.</TE>
<TE>   Running back John Avery, a 1998 first-round draft pick of the
Dolphins, signed with the Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL.</TE>

<TE>   Linebacker Marco Cooper was suspended from the Ohio State team for
the 2002 season and barred from campus after he was arrested on
felony charges of drug abuse and carrying a concealed weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The junior from Detroit is accused of having a handgun, ammunition
and Ecstasy pills hidden in his sport utility vehicle. He was pulled
over for a traffic violation on Saturday night after Ohio State's
spring game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas running back Cedric Benson, the Big 12 freshman of the year
last season, was arrested on misdemeanor drug and alcohol possession
charges. Benson was also drafted by the Dodgers.... Police issued
arrest warrants for four University of Colorado football players
accused of giving alcohol and marijuana to minors at a party where a
woman alleged she was gang raped. The four players, all 20 years old,
are: Marques Harris, sophomore, defensive end; Corey Alexander,
sophomore, wide receiver; Ron Monteihl II, redshirt freshman; and
Joseph Allen Mackey Jr., freshman, cornerback.</TE>

<HD>Kings' Fate Set Before Playoffs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>It's a shame that the Kings' season came to an end so soon because
this season's team is better and deeper than the squad that reached
the second round of the playoffs a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings have no one to blame but themselves for being bounced in
the first round by Colorado and goaltender Patrick Roy. Not because
they were a better team than the Avalanche but because the Kings
shouldn't have had to face the defending Stanley Cup champions this
early in the postseason.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think this matchup was anything like a No. 2 seed vs. a
No. 7 seed," Colorado's Mike Keane said. "The Kings are a very solid
team that is well coached. They gave us everything we could handle."</LD>
<TE>   Flash back to April 10. With three games remaining in the regular
season, the Kings were fifth in the Western Conference when they hit
the road for crucial games at Vancouver and San Jose before closing
the season at home against Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   If the Kings had won all three games, they would have assured
themselves not only of a higher playoff position but also an outside
chance of winning the Pacific Division.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of playing with the type of passion they displayed in
a tough seven-game series against the Avalanche, the Kings fell flat
on their faces. They lost to the Canucks and Sharks before defeating
the Mighty Ducks to finish the season with 95 points.</TE>
<TE>   One more point would have meant a first-round matchup with St.
Louis instead of Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked hard this season, but it's still over," King defenseman
Jaroslav Modry said. "Unfortunately, we came up short again. The
second year in a row and it's frustrating. Early exit once again."</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the glass half full, the Kings made great strides this
season under Coach Andy Murray and his staff. General Manager Dave
Taylor picked up a quality center in Jason Allison, who should
continue to be a force. Ziggy Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh both stepped
up their all-around games. Role players such as Mikko Eloranta and
Philippe Boucher seemed to get better with every game, and Felix
Potvin proved again that he's a playoff goalie, thanks to strong
support from Murray.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the Kings will be watching the rest of the playoffs from
home.</TE>
<TE>   Time Is Right for Weekes</TE>
<TE>   The most unlikely hero of the first round has to be Carolina
goaltender Kevin Weekes, who was picked up from Tampa Bay in a
late-season trade to back up Arturs Irbe but ended up being the
savior for the Hurricanes against New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   After Irbe fell apart in Games 3 and 4, Weekes stepped in and
dominated the Devils to help Carolina advance to the second round for
the first time since the franchise moved to North Carolina in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Weekes, who had only two regular-season starts after being
acquired by Carolina on March 5, made his first playoff start in Game
5 and made 32 saves to shut out the Devils, 1-0. Then he followed
that effort with a 40-save performance in the Hurricanes'
series-clinching victory in Game 6.</TE>
<TE>   "Life isn't too bad right now," said Weekes after he recorded the
franchise's first shutout since 1986 when the Hurricanes were the
Hartford Whalers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Weekes' recent play, Carolina Coach Paul Maurice recently
said that he wouldn't be surprised to see Irbe back in goal before
the Hurricanes' second-round series against Montreal is completed.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have a lot of confidence in both our goaltenders,"
Maurice told the Raleigh News Observer. "Archie played phenomenal in
the first two games, but Kevin gets the first chance right now."</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   Now that New Jersey center Bobby Holik plans to become an
unrestricted free agent on July 1 rather than work out a new deal
with the Devils, the Mighty Ducks should make him a top priority.
Holik, 31, certainly increased his value with a team-high four goals
against Carolina in the first round. Holik, who has scored at least
20 goals in five of the last six seasons playing primarily against
the opposing team's top center, would definitely help the Ducks' weak
power play. Holik also wouldn't look bad in a Kings' uniform.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Around Philadelphia, most of the blame for the Flyers' first-round
playoff collapse to Ottawa has fallen on the shoulders of Coach Bill
Barber. Many of Barber's players criticized him for not making
adjustments to keep the Flyers sharp down the stretch. But the person
who should be feeling the heat is General Manager Bobby Clarke, who
has somehow avoided blame despite having a payroll of $55.5 million
and a roster at the season's start that included seven players who
have been All-Stars and three former 50-goal scorers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NHL playoffs have a long history of violence, but this year's
first round seemed to have a little more than usual. Check out the
list of players that have or will miss postseason games because of
injuries. They include Toronto's Mats Sundin, the New York Islanders'
Michael Peca and Kenny Johnsson, Montreal's Richard Zednik, the
Kings' Deadmarsh and Colorado's Forsberg.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all seen a different trend in this business, and it's to
expand the physical margins," Toronto Coach Pat Quinn said. "I don't
know the reasons why. But standards aren't there right now."</TE>
<TE>   The NHL can't afford to allow this to continue, but unless
Commissioner Gary Bettman does something soon, expect more of the
same.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although Carolina raised ticket prices 20% for the second round,
Hurricanes fans turned out, buying more than 11,000 tickets over the
weekend. It proves that the NHL can work in a Southern city as long
as the team wins.</TE>
<TE>   Quote of the Week</TE>
<TE>   "It all comes back to respect. That's pretty disappointing to see
that happen. But you can't judge all Americans on a few people that
have no class. Most people are pretty respectful and are good
people."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto's Shayne Corson about New York Islander fans who booed the
Canadian national anthem before Game 6 and later burned a Canadian
flag in the parking lot of the Nassau Coliseum on Sunday. Corson will
not play in tonight's Game 7 because of a league suspension "for
kicking" in Game 6.</TE>

<LD>Toronto forward Shayne Corson was suspended by the NHL on Monday for
Game 7 of the Maple Leafs' playoff series against the New York
Islanders.</LD>
<LD>   Corson was suspended for tonight's game in Toronto for kicking New
York defenseman Eric Cairns during a fight Sunday late in Game 6.</LD>
<LD>   It is the first suspension handed down by the league for the rough
and contentious series that has seen the Islanders lose defenseman
Kenny Jonsson and captain Michael Peca to injuries following
questionable hits in Game 5 at Toronto.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since sustaining a concussion when he knocked
himself out delivering an open-ice check six days earlier, St. Louis
Blues forward Dallas Drake skated before the team practiced on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Drake, 33, hoped to be available for Game 1 of the second round at
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Coach Joel Quenneville was noncommittal on Drake's
status.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Gets Second Shot at San Jose</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Phil Johnson realizes that second chances for college basketball
coaches are as rare as huge crowds at San Jose State games.</LD>
<LD>   He plans on getting both this fall.</LD>
<LD>   Three years after leaving San Jose State to be an assistant coach
with the NBA's Chicago Bulls, Johnson returned Monday for a second
term as the school's men's basketball coach.</LD>
<TE>   He quickly filled the vacancy left by Steve Barnes, who resigned
earlier in the day to become the associate head coach at Iowa State.</TE>
<TE>   The Spartans went 12-16 in Johnson's first and only season in
charge, but made major strides toward turning around a perennially
moribund program. After three miserable seasons with the lowly Bulls,
he hopes to finish what he started in California.</TE>
<TE>   "For three years, I sat up in that office [at Chicago] and thought
that there were a lot of things left undone at San Jose State," said
Johnson, a top assistant to Lute Olson during Arizona's national
title run in 1997. "There wasn't a day that went by that I didn't
think about San Jose State."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes was 39-51 in three seasons at San Jose State.</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Awakening this morning still dressed in the drama of a Game 7, your
faithful correspondent would like to jump up and report that the
Kings tried hard, the Kings are great guys, the Kings are still our
champs.</LD>
<LD>   But he awakens instead with wrinkled clothes, swollen eyes, and
the truth throbbing like a two-year hangover.</LD>
<LD>   Gritty is getting old. Charming is feeling. Resilient reeks.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings have failed to advance past the first round of the
Stanley Cup playoffs for the 25th time in the 34-year history of the
organization, and does it really matter how it happened?</TE>
<TE>   For all their heartwarming vibes and inspirational reflections,
the Kings once again have ended their season by being kicked under
the couch like a cheap romance novel.</TE>
<TE>   For all the talk of how they pushed Colorado Avalanche to a second
consecutive Game 7, the final score was again a blowout, this time,
4-0.</TE>
<TE>   And for all the predictions of progress, this year they were
eliminated in the first round, or about two weeks earlier than last
year.</TE>
<TE>   If anybody in town is happy with any part of that, then, well,
that is what is wrong with the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   So they forced a deciding game against the defending Stanley Cup
champions.</TE>
<TE>   So? They wouldn't have been seeded seventh and matched against
those champions if, in the regular season, they had not lost at home
to the likes of Columbus, Minnesota and Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   So they nearly pulled off an impossible comeback from a
three-games-to-one deficit.</TE>
<TE>   So? Heroics would not have been necessary if, in the first two
games here, their defense should have figured a way to mold six goals
against Patrick Roy into at least one victory. Roy, incidentally,
gave up only six more goals the rest of the series.</TE>
<TE>   I can see the e-mails now:</TE>
<TE>   Andy Murray is a wonderful coach. Dave Taylor is a smart general
manager. The Kings are inspirational players. You danged fool.</TE>
<TE>   Save your keystrokes. I agree with all of that. Even, sometimes,
the fool part.</TE>
<TE>   The coach is well prepared. His boss has made some good deals. The
players usually show up.</TE>
<TE>   But for the organization to take the next step forward, they must
admit that is not enough.</TE>
<TE>   They must acknowledge that this season was not a success.</TE>
<TE>   They must admit that losing in consecutive Game 7s at the Pepsi
Center is not the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   It is the Kings, not the Avalanche, who have the richest owner in
professional sports.</TE>
<TE>   It is the Kings, not the Avalanche, who have the sports world's
finest money-making arena.</TE>
<TE>   It is the Kings, not the Avalanche, who even have the best
player-attracting practice facility.</TE>
<TE>   Yet on Monday, it was the Avalanche which, "Played, by far, the
best game of this round," said Coach Bob Hartley.</TE>
<TE>   And it was the Kings who, "Actually played better in the first
five minutes of the second period than in the first period," Murray
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hard to imagine a team not playing its best in the first period of
any sort of Game 7, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche, which outshot the Kings, 12-3, in the first period,
then used that momentum five minutes into the second period, like a
strong breeze, to push Chris Drury past three Kings on a spectacular
goal.</TE>
<TE>   The last two Kings beaten on the play were Mathieu Schneider and
Brad Chartrand, and don't think Murray didn't notice.</TE>
<TE>   "He skated past a forward and a defenseman, that's something he
should not have been able to do," the coach said.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche then took advantage of the Kings' disappointment
with another goal less than a minute later, from Alex Tanguay, this
one also past Schneider, who finished the game as a minus-four.</TE>
<TE>   And that was that. Again.</TE>
<TE>   Yet today we'll probably hear how it was a great run, how fun, and
so what if they fell only one game short, they'll get them next year!</TE>
<TE>   Just wondering, but what would we be hearing if the Kings were the
Lakers? How badly would they be ripped if they were the Dodgers?</TE>
<TE>   To think that this series or season was acceptable is to insult
Murray and the feelings of empowerment he is trying to instill.</TE>
<TE>   One New York newspaper picked the Kings to win the Stanley Cup.
Many picked them to win this series. Only four points separated these
teams during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Said Murray: "Last year, I don't know if we felt the sense of
disappointment that we feel now."</TE>
<TE>   Said King President Tim Leiweke: "This stinks. Unlike last year,
we weren't just happy to be here. We have to figure out a way to go
beyond this point."</TE>
<TE>   Good words. Time for actions. They don't need much, but they do
need more.</TE>
<TE>   Depleted by injuries in this series, they need more depth and more
scoring.</TE>
<TE>   And they need more accountability, both in their offices and their
community, a belief that this 25th year of failing to advance past
the first round of the playoffs is not a happy anniversary.</TE>

<HD>Raptors Don't Quit, Force Game 5</HD>
<DH>NBA playoffs: Toronto averts ouster for second time in
three days, beats Detroit, 89-83.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>The Toronto Raptors, a team that had every excuse to quit long ago,
have pushed the Detroit Pistons to a deciding Game 5.</LD>
<LD>   Avoiding an end to their season for the second time in three days,
the Raptors found another way to win without Vince Carter.</LD>
<LD>   Keon Clark had 19 points and 16 rebounds and Morris Peterson
scored a career playoff-high 20 points as Toronto beat Detroit,
89-83, Monday night in Game 4 of their first-round series.</LD>
<TE>   The Raptors lost 13 consecutive games after the All-Star break,
lost Carter to season-ending knee surgery and then fell behind, 2-0,
in this best-of-five series. But with April about to turn into May,
they've managed to keep going.</TE>
<TE>   "This team has shown a lot of heart. Even when we get down, we
never say die. Even when other people give up on us, we keep
fighting," Raptor forward Jerome Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors have shown the Pistons they're no pushovers despite
the absence of their best player, and something about win-or-go home
games seems to bring out the best in them. Toronto is 5-1 when facing
elimination over the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons failed to capitalize on Toronto's slow start,
struggled for long stretches on offense and got another subpar game
from Jerry Stackhouse. Now, they must go into an elimination game
Thursday with a roster that lacks the playoff experience of
Toronto's.</TE>
<TE>   "Playoff experience is important, but I don't think it's
essential," Piston Coach Rick Carlisle said. "I think our guys have
learned a lot in the last four games, and this next game is what
basketball is all about--it's a one-game season."</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors, winning at home for the 10th consecutive time, took
the lead for good in the second quarter and held off every Detroit
run.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons found a way to get the ball out of Antonio Davis'
hands after he hurt them so much in Game 3, but the Raptors had
plenty of other options. Alvin Williams had 15 points and nine
assists. Peterson made eight of 12 shots, scoring eight points in the
fourth quarter, and Clark had 15 points and 13 rebounds by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit, meanwhile, looked to reserves Corliss Williamson and Jon
Barry for points in the fourth quarter as Stackhouse made only six of
18 field goals and scored 15 points.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a tough trip coming up here," Stackhouse said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Raptors made their first shot and then missed their
next 12, the Pistons could only go ahead by eight points and Toronto
came back and regained the lead before the end of the quarter.</TE>

<HD>Blatter Keeps Battling Back</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, the embattled Swiss president of FIFA,
insisted Monday that allegations of corruption and financial
mismanagement within the organization are false and are hurting
soccer's world governing body.</LD>
<LD>   "The house is very much in order," Blatter said in Dubai. "There
is no financial discrepancy. We, in fact, are pretty sound
financially and there is more transparency than ever before."</LD>
<LD>   Blatter is running for reelection against Issa Hayatou of
Cameroon, with voting scheduled May 29 in Seoul. He has claimed that
opponents are out to smear him in the wake of last year's bankruptcy
of FIFA's longtime marketing partner, ISL-ISMM.</LD>
<TE>   "I was blamed for the collapse of ISL, which is not true," Blatter
said. "The only saving grace is that I was not blamed for the Sept.
11 attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Blatter unilaterally and controversially
suspended an audit of FIFA's finances, claiming there had been
breaches of confidentiality. That decision will be revisited Friday
at an emergency meeting of FIFA's executive committee in Zurich.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, at Blatter's request, a Swiss court issued an
injunction against Farah Addo, forbidding the president of the
Somalia Football Assn. and vice president of the Confederation of
African Football from repeating allegations of vote-buying by
Blatter's supporters during Blatter's 1998 presidential election
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   World Cup 2002</TE>
<TE>   World Cup cohost Japan extended its unbeaten run to six games
Monday by shutting out Slovakia, 1-0, in the opening game of the
four-nation Kirin Cup tournament in front of 55,144 at the National
Stadium in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Akinori Nishizawa scored the goal in the 38th minute.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portugal, which opens its quest for the World Cup on June 5
against the United States, received a boost when striker Pedro
Pauleta was voted the French first division player of the year by his
fellow players and coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Pauleta, 29, leads the French league with 21 goals for Girondins
Bordeaux, and helped the club win the French League Cup earlier this
month.</TE>
<TE>   In 28 games for Portugal, he has scored 11 goals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Argentina lost one of its potential World Cup players when tests
revealed that winger Lucas Castroman had fractured two vertebrae in
his lower back while playing for Lazio against Bologna in the Italian
Serie A on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Castroman, 21, was only on the fringes of the national team and
was a longshot to make Coach Marcelo Bielsa's 23-man roster.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defending world champion France got an injury scare when officials
at the Greek club Olympiakos confirmed that midfielder Christian
Karembeu had suffered a groin injury in Sunday's 2-1 loss to AEK
Athens in the Greek Cup final. Karembeu, 32, has returned to France
for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's postal service said Monday that it would double
check all mail sent to World Cup-related locations as a precaution
against bio-terrorism threats.</TE>
<TE>   Korea Post said it would intensify security on overseas mail and
parcels starting Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Can't Give Guerrero Short Shrift</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A father playing catch with his son. It's a simple but poignant
gesture, almost a rite of passage, establishing a bond that can last
a lifetime.</LD>
<LD>   As James Guerrero nears his 18th birthday, his father, Pete, finds
himself reminiscing about those early days in the front yard, sitting
on a lawn chair with a pot of uncut pinto beans and tossing them to
James to see if he could hit one with his bat.</LD>
<LD>   "I used to wear a pair of safety classes," Pete said. "You get
hit, it stings."</LD>
<TE>   No father has ever felt prouder receiving a pinto bean sting.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in hard work," Pete said. "With James, I never had to
pressure him to practice. It was something he was born with."</TE>
<TE>   From age 5 through this, his senior season at Fontana High,
Guerrero has followed a disciplined path to baseball success:
Practice, practice, practice.</TE>
<TE>   Pete remembers hitting his son close to 200 ground balls one
afternoon in the front yard. James couldn't come in the house until
he fielded the last 50 in a row without an error. If he missed No.
49, it meant he had to start over.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero is always preparing for the next at-bat, the next game,
the next challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just confident in my ability," he said. "I'm confident of
hitting any pitches and taking any ground balls. My Dad instilled
that in me as a young kid."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero is 5 feet 7, his same height since arriving at Fontana as
a freshman. Four years later, he owns many of the school's hitting
records besides being an exceptional fielder at shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen him hit a ball 450 feet," Coach Jody Stevens said.
"I've seen him make plays at shortstop nobody else can make. He does
everything right."</TE>
<TE>   The last two summers, he has played on U.S. junior national teams
in Cuba and Mexico, beating out taller, more publicized players. Get
used to Guerrero surprising the skeptics, for he rarely disappoints
when given a fair chance.</TE>
<TE>   "As a short person, you have to work twice as hard because if you
have the height, [scouts] automatically assume, 'There's a
ballplayer,' " he said. "With a short person, they wonder, 'Can he
play?' I wish people wouldn't look at the height difference. If you
can flat out play, you can play."</TE>
<TE>   Earning respect has come routinely for Guerrero. Even in youth
baseball, opposing parents would ask to shake his father's hand
because of the way James played the game.</TE>
<TE>   He has been a four-year starter at Fontana and a two-year
All-Citrus Belt League selection. This season, though Fontana is
struggling with a 2-9 record in league play, he's batting .472 with
four home runs, 10 triples, six doubles and 26 runs batted in. He has
a 3.6 grade-point average and signed with San Diego State last
November.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me a very proud father that people consider him a great
human being before a great ballplayer," Pete said.</TE>
<TE>   Pete and his wife, Rebecca, work for Kaiser Permanente. They've
always made time to attend games when their three children were
competing.</TE>
<TE>   "They're loving parents," Guerrero said. "They love me to death,
like I love them."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero's confidence in his father's teachings is understandable,
considering they keep ringing true. "I remember him saying, 'Practice
makes perfect, hard work pays off,' " he said. "If you think about
it, it's true. I worked hard as a little kid growing up and am still
working hard."</TE>
<TE>   For those who wonder if Guerrero's size might hinder him at the
college or professional levels, don't worry.</TE>
<TE>   "I always taught my kids to just believe in yourself," Pete said.
"Never let anybody tell you you can't do it. I've told him every
single time since he was a kid, 'When you step between the lines, you
have to believe you're the best player on the field.' It's something
he believes in. He never backs down. He's always been fearless."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to a father who cares and a pot of pinto beans, Guerrero
has become one of the top high school infielders in Southern
California.</TE>

<HD>Cooper Says Sparks Want to Go 32-0</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Coach sets undefeated year as team goal as
his 2001 WNBA champions begin training camp.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 9-0 start leading to a 28-4 regular-season record. A league-record
18-game winning streak. A 6-1 playoff run and the WNBA championship.</LD>
<LD>   All that was last season.</LD>
<LD>   As the defending champion Sparks arrived Monday at Loyola
Marymount to open their 2002 training camp, Coach Michael Cooper had
their next goal in place: 32-0.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm putting the onus on the ladies," Cooper said. "If we take
this one game at a time, we could be the UConn of professional
basketball and go undefeated this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be tough because the league is better, but it's not
out of the realm. Our ultimate goal is to win the championship, but
we would like to distinguish ourselves by going undefeated."</TE>
<TE>   That sound you hear is opposing coaches hurrying to post Cooper's
comments on every bulletin board in the WNBA.</TE>
<TE>   "I know of one board it will be on, and that's [Houston's]," said
Cooper, referring to the four-time league champion Comets.</TE>
<TE>   Let the mind games begin.</TE>
<TE>   Even though there may be, at best, two available spots on the
Sparks' 11-woman roster, Cooper and General Manager Penny Toler have
tried to assemble a highly competitive camp roster.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the returning players are seven rookies, among them the
fifth overall pick of the 2002 draft, Nikki Teasley, who was obtained
in the trade with Portland for Ukari Figgs, and 2001 Notre Dame
forward Kelley Siemon, who played last year with Athletes in Action.
Also expected to provide a lift is guard Sophia Witherspoon, a
five-year veteran who came from Portland in the Figgs-Teasley trade.</TE>
<TE>   "This camp is loaded at every position," said guard Nicky
McCrimmon.</TE>
<TE>   But does that translate into a dominant team?</TE>
<TE>   Cooper and Toler are tinkering with the chemistry by replacing
Figgs with Teasley, who was brilliant at North Carolina but is
unproven in the WNBA.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting guard Tamecka Dixon had an all-star year, despite nagging
foot injuries, and said she still is only 85% recovered.</TE>
<TE>   The schedule has the Sparks playing games on consecutive nights
six times, and nine of those 12 games are on the road.</TE>
<TE>   No Spark player was eager to back Cooper's prediction. But all
believe they can be a better team.</TE>
<TE>   "We can get a lot better," Dixon said. "But this year is going to
be a mental test. I feel we practice harder than anyone in the
league, so physically we'll be OK. But mentally, we have to be very
tough, because we know every other team got better."</TE>
<TE>   If there's anything Cooper has taken from the pro coaches he
played or worked for--among them former Laker bosses Pat Riley and
Del Harris--it is that teams must evolve to avoid complacency.</TE>
<TE>   "As I told the players, we have to change the look of our team,
but it's a team we're very comfortable with," Cooper said. "Our
thinking is, you have to back up starters with starters. And we have
a good core group that we can pick from."</TE>
<TE>   Not every player reported Monday. Starting forward DeLisha Milton
is playing professionally in Parma, Italy, and may not arrive until
May 9, depending on how her team does in league playoffs. Reserve
forward Vedrana Grgin-Fonseca is playing in Spain and is not expected
until May 15.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve forward Rhonda Mapp is considering whether to play this
season, and Toler said Mapp will be put on the suspended list if she
does not report today.</TE>
<TE>   Among the three free agents invited to camp is 6-foot-5 center
Erika de Souza, who plays for Brazil's national team. She was
scheduled to arrive today.</TE>

<HD>Strawberry Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Darryl Strawberry--once the local kid who made good, winning World
Series rings with the New York Mets and the Yankees--was sentenced to
18 months in prison Monday for violating probation.</LD>
<LD>   Strawberry's athletic exploits at Crenshaw High were once the
stuff from which legends were made. But those are nearly forgotten at
his alma mater, replaced by a cautionary tale spun from his
well-documented struggles with drugs and alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   "You know that I think Darryl's a good boy," said Major Dennis, a
family friend who took over as Crenshaw's baseball coach shortly
after Strawberry was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1980 draft by the
New York Mets. "I hate what's happening to him, but that's life. It
could happen to anybody.</LD>
<TE>   "Hopefully he can learn from this and so can these kids," Dennis
said, motioning to his players as they took positions Monday on the
same field where Strawberry played 22 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   In a Tampa, Fla., courtroom earlier Monday, Judge Ralph Steinberg
sentenced Strawberry to 18 months in prison for violating the terms
of his probation stemming from a 1999 conviction on drug and
solicitation of prostitution charges.</TE>
<TE>   Among the rules Strawberry broke while at an Ocala area drug
treatment center, where he was initially sent in lieu of prison:
smoking, having sex with another treatment center resident and
trading baseballs for cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Strawberry's lawyer, Darryl Rouson, sought to have Strawberry sent
to another drug treatment center.</TE>
<TE>   But Judge Florence Foster, who repeatedly chose treatment rather
than prison for Strawberry, is on medical leave and is no longer
presiding over his case. And Steinberg, a retired judge who returned
to the bench to handle the matter, said prison was warranted since
Strawberry violated probation in the case six times.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the court, Strawberry, 40, said he accepted the
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "I would just like to get this behind me," said Strawberry, who
had been incarcerated in the Hillsborough County Jail since March. "I
would like to do my 18 months and move on. I don't want to have this
over my head ... life is going in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Hillsborough County State Attorney Darrell Dirks was
pleased with Monday's outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't like someone telling him what to do," Dirks told the
judge. "At some point he should be punished for that."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, prosecutors had urged Foster to send Strawberry to prison
after he violated house arrest at a different drug treatment center
when he escaped and went on a cross-state drug binge.</TE>
<TE>   Rouson, who claimed Strawberry has been clean for more than a
year, said he expects Strawberry to serve fewer than 13 months once
he receives credit for time already served.</TE>
<TE>   Florida law states that inmates must serve a minimum of 85% of
their sentence before being released.</TE>
<TE>   Rouson said he expects the Department of Corrections to decide
within 10 days where Strawberry will serve his sentence, though
Rouson wants his client sent to Zephyrhills Correctional Institution
near Tampa, which has programs for both drug-addicted and mentally
ill inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw High basketball Coach Willie West, who coached Strawberry
for two seasons on the court, was wistful when talking about his
former player. He said he just wants Strawberry to get better.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he wanted to get the thing over with so he could get on
with his life," West said. "That would be the proper thing to do ...
so he could get focused again and do positive things because he was a
positive influence at one time. It's unfortunate that this had to
happen to him."</TE>
<TE>   Strawberry, a former Dodger and eight-time All-Star, won World
Series rings with the Mets in 1986 and the New York Yankees in 1996
and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his legal problems, he has been treated for stomach and
colon cancer. Crenshaw senior third baseman Osvaldo Castro said he
once looked up to Strawberry but was growing weary of Strawberry's
legal woes.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of gives us a bad name because I feel that he should have
done better for himself," Castro said. "It's like that talks about us
[and is a reflection] because he came out of our high school. He has
so much success and he was one of the best ballplayers. He should
have taken better care of himself and he would have done better.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at his mistakes, and I hope that I can learn from them."</TE>
<TE>   West said he was surprised that Strawberry fell so far, so fast.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought it would ever get to this, to where he would
suffer that way," West said. "But it goes to show you that if you
don't manage your life right ... drugs and alcohol don't know color
or creed. It doesn't make a difference. They'll get you.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts because he could have been the role model these kids
need," he said, noting that none of today's Cougars were even born
when Strawberry lorded over the 'Shaw and the oldest of them would
have been just nine when Strawberry last wore a Dodger uniform.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids don't know who Strawberry is other than just being a
name, just another baseball player that screwed up," West said.</TE>
<TE>   "He should know, though, that he's still welcome here."</TE>

<LD>U.S. Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe put out the polite word that
personal coaches would not be allowed at all of the practices at
Oklahoma City and Houston in the first two rounds of Davis Cup
earlier this year. Pete Sampras, who has won more Grand Slam titles
than any other male player, went along with the program, as did
star-in-the-making Andy Roddick.</LD>
<LD>   John McEnroe, Patrick's older brother, had another approach during
his short Davis Cup tenure. He didn't want to shake the comfort zone
of the top players, and so Brad Gilbert, who was then coaching Andre
Agassi, was a ubiquitous figure.</LD>
<LD>   Two brothers, two styles.</LD>
<TE>   Fed Cup captain Billie Jean King adopted Patrick's philosophy in
an attempt to foment team unity in Charlotte, N.C., leading up to the
first round against Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, it worked all right.</TE>
<TE>   The team unified ... against Jennifer Capriati.</TE>
<TE>   King kicked Capriati off the squad on Friday for not agreeing to
comply with team rules. Capriati did not actually break the rules, as
has been widely reported. She was dismissed before she had a personal
practice session with her coach and hitting partner, a fine point,
but an important one.</TE>
<TE>   It would be easy to characterize Capriati as a spoiled star who
simply needs to grow up. How crucial is one extra practice when your
reputation, as well as future Olympic participation, are on the line?
(Olympic eligibility is tied to Fed Cup appearances.) If Monica Seles
and the others could survive a few days under this directive, why not
Capriati?</TE>
<TE>   It also would not be hard to criticize King for a lack of
flexibility. Why not let the players work out with their personal
coaches after a formal team practice? If Michael Jordan wanted to
have an extra practice during the 1992 Olympics, it's unlikely the
coaches would have protested.</TE>
<TE>   But neither depiction quite tells the whole story.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati apparently was caught in the middle of a dispute between
her father and coach, Stefano, and King. Stefano tried to attend
practice on Tuesday and was told it was a closed session.</TE>
<TE>   The tension between the Capriati entourage and King escalated.
Other players became aware of it and the controversy turned into a
distraction. It's just a guess, but King might have reacted
differently Friday if there hadn't been the earlier situation with
Stefano. And maybe Capriati wouldn't have pushed the issue if the
coach in question had been someone other than her father.</TE>
<TE>   Once Capriati was kicked off the team, the forming of alliances
among the remaining team members was fascinating. Lisa Raymond, once
involved in a bitter dispute with King about being bypassed for the
2000 Olympics in Sydney, came down squarely on the side of the
captain.</TE>
<TE>   So did Meghann Shaughnessy, who used to blast the USTA for its
lack of financial support. Seles, who never likes to get in the
middle of these things, also took a shot at Capriati, noting the team
rules were known in advance.</TE>
<TE>   Still, almost no one would have anticipated the outcome in
Charlotte. After the first day of competition, Saturday, Austria led,
2-0. Seles lost to lefty Barbara Schwartz in straight stets, and
because Capriati had been dismissed after the draw, the U.S.
forfeited her singles match.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz clinched the match for Austria on Sunday, beating
Shaughnessy, 4-6, 7-6 (7), 9-7, fighting off one match point. It was
not the first time Schwartz delivered a shock result on a clay court.
In 1999, as a qualifier, she defeated Venus Williams in the fourth
round at the French Open.</TE>
<TE>   USTA officials, who fully backed King, seemed almost relieved the
controversial event was over. USTA President Merv Heller, on his way
to the airport on Sunday, spoke for himself and probably everyone
else. He was doing an interview about the USTA's new partnership with
the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), but naturally, talk turned to
the Fed Cup debacle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate," he said. "There were no winners."</TE>
<TE>   Well, almost. There was Schwartz. The oft-injured player was
hailed as a heroine in her country. One Austrian paper, Kronen
Zeitung, was thrilled by her performance, writing: "Schwartz
perfected the tennis fairy tale. Seven defeats in seven Fed Cup duels
with the U.S.! Austria traveled to America as a total outsider--on
Tuesday the girls return home as triumphant winners. The victory of
the century has one name: Babsi Schwartz!"</TE>
<TE>   Tennis fairy tale? Didn't we once write those words about
Capriati?</TE>

<HD>Soul-Searching Begins in Utah</HD>
<DH>NBA playoffs: Kings oust Jazz, 91-86, bringing questions
about futures of Stockton and Malone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Now comes the summer of discontent.</LD>
<LD>   With eight free agents and an increasingly restless Karl Malone,
the Utah Jazz bowed out in the first round of the playoffs for the
second season in a row, losing its second game in three days in the
once-feared Delta Center, 91-86, to the Sacramento Kings, who won the
best-of-five series, 3-1.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings, the Western Conference's No. 1-seeded team, will now
play the No. 4 Dallas Mavericks in a matchup of the NBA's two most
explosive teams that starts Saturday in Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm glad to get this series over," said a relieved King Coach
Rick Adelman. "I think our team learned a lot from it, but now we've
got to get our track shoes on."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who had swept the Jazz, 4-0, this season, winning by an
average of 23 points, split the first two games of this series in
Arco Arena and never scored more than 91 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Utah historically has always played possession in the playoffs,"
Adelman said. "They're competitors. They're going to fight and claw.
If we can win three of four ball games and score 90 points,
terrific."</TE>
<TE>   And what will happen to the Jazz?</TE>
<TE>   Monday a Salt Lake Tribune headline announced, "Jazz Nearing End
of an Era." In the story, John Stockton, 40, refused to speculate if
this might be his last game, something he has never done. On the
other hand, Malone, 38, who has spent a lot of his summers recently,
and parts of some seasons, scouting around for a new opportunity,
remarked coyly:</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely going to be interesting, to say the least."</TE>
<TE>   Monday night, however, it was a curiously passive Malone who
showed up, scoring only 14 points with three rebounds, missing 13 of
his 20 shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings dropped their centers Vlade Divac and Scot Pollard into
the lane, daring Jarron Collins and Greg Ostertag to shoot, helping
Webber contain Malone. Malone, the master of getting to the foul
line, didn't shoot a free throw until only 1:22 remained when he was
awarded his only two of the game ... both of which he missed.</TE>
<TE>   And suddenly, it was summer in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year we've been talking about that," said Jazz Coach Jerry
Sloan of the speculation about Malone and Stockton. "A lot of people
thought John and Karl should have retired 10 years ago....</TE>
<TE>   "We accept any decision they make, to play or not play. Our
biggest ambition this year, to start up with, we're playing two
rookies [in rotation]. I thought it was imperative to get to the
playoffs some way, somehow....</TE>
<TE>   "I don't worry about that [Malone and Stockton leaving] because I
have no control over it. It's just like we lost [Jeff] Hornacek,
Shandon Anderson, Howard Eisley, all those guys. We still had to
play. We might not be as good, but my job stays the same."</TE>
<TE>   Malone still has one year left on his contract and, after the
usual maneuvering and posturing, is expected back. Stockton, who had
one of his best seasons since turning 35, is a free agent but isn't
expected to go anywhere else or retire.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that team over there is ready to pass any torch,"
said Adelman. "They're going to be good as long as those guys [Malone
and Stockton] want to play."</TE>
<TE>   Just not as good as they used to be, and not good enough to go on
from here.</TE>

<HD>Unbearable: West an Ex-Laker</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Hall of famer leaves the team he's
synonymous with to take over Grizzlies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry West, the only NBA logo most basketball fans have ever known,
has resigned his $1 million-a-year consulting job with the Lakers to
become president of the Memphis Grizzlies.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement will be made at a Memphis hotel today, ending a
four-decade relationship between the Lakers and West, a Hall of Fame
guard and builder of two championship eras in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   He departs on friendly terms with team owner Jerry Buss, the two
having met as recently as two weeks ago as West considered a return
to the game full time after his resignation from the team in August
2000.</LD>
<TE>   "Jerry West is part of our legacy," Jeanie Buss, a club vice
president and the owner's daughter, said Monday. "We consider him
royalty."</TE>
<TE>   West was unavailable for comment, maintaining the low profile he
adopted quickly when several teams began courting him. Early on, he
would say only that he had begun to feel competitive urges again, but
he insisted to friends that he would consider only the perfect job in
the perfect situation.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, that was in Memphis. Sources said Monday that West
turned down larger offers by other organizations for the chance to
run the Grizzlies, a 1995 expansion team that moved from Vancouver
last summer and won 23 games this season.</TE>
<TE>   He decided this weekend to accept a multiyear, multimillion-dollar
offer by Grizzly owner Michael Heisley, and to resume a career that
appeared over when health concerns prompted his resignation shortly
after the Lakers' first NBA title in 12 years. A source in Memphis
said the deal included an ownership stake in the team, but that was
unconfirmed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about the money," said an NBA source. "He's just
ready to go back."</TE>
<TE>   Content in retirement in his first year away, West, 63, gradually
felt another tug from the NBA, and recently stopped resisting. As a
consultant who reported to his replacement and protege, Mitch
Kupchak, West scouted a draft camp in Virginia earlier this month,
and had attended most of the Laker home games in the second half of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, he telephoned Magic Johnson, a longtime friend and
Laker vice president, saying that he would leave the Lakers for the
Grizzlies. They spoke for a long time, Johnson said, and the
conversation occasionally got emotional.</TE>
<TE>   "You know he wrestled with this," said Johnson, also a Laker
legend and also considering a more active part in the game. "This is
a Laker guy. Through and through, this is a Laker man. We almost
cried together when he actually told me. He wanted me to know before
it got out. It was one of those special moments that I've had. I've
only had two--when [Coach Pat] Riley was telling me he was leaving
and now this. It hurts. It hurts in terms of him not being around. I
love talking basketball with Jerry West."</TE>
<TE>   Although he had taken a secondary role in the organization, West
remained an advisor to Kupchak. The game has plenty who evaluate
talent, but few have been able to put the right players onto the
right teams better than West.</TE>
<TE>   "He has such great instincts for players and what they are going
to be," said Laker special consultant Bill Sharman. "In my days as a
general manager, I relied almost totally on his opinions. That worked
out pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   In one summer six years ago, West added Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe
Bryant and Derek Fisher to a roster that needed an overhaul. Midway
through the next season, Robert Horry was acquired from Phoenix. Rick
Fox signed the next summer.</TE>
<TE>   Those five players have made up the core of the Lakers' last two
championship teams and, indeed, were on the floor together Sunday
when the Lakers, seeking their third consecutive title, eliminated
the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't replace a Jerry West," Johnson said. "It means more
than basketball, more than anybody could ever know. Because, he's not
only the greatest executive, the best that's ever done it, but also
he's a passionate, caring man, and about more than your basketball
career.</TE>
<TE>   "He cried at every retirement. He cried at every trade he made,
because he really cared about guys. That's hard to find. Most people
in this business really don't care. You just come and do your job,
and they never get to know you as Earvin the person, or Shaquille,
the man. I'm talking about really caring. If somebody were sick or
had died in your family, he's the first one calling, the first one
over to the house, wondering what he could do. And he actually does
it. He doesn't just say he's going to do something."</TE>
<TE>   West's decision surprised many who had seen him consider
retirement, then reconsider. He'd thought before about other jobs
but, ultimately, could not leave Los Angeles, the only place he'd
earned a regular paycheck, or the Lakers, the only professional
basketball he'd known. It appears that West will live in Memphis most
of the time but he's not selling his house in Bel Air.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised he's leaving L.A., but not surprised he's getting
back into basketball," Johnson said. "That's what he is. He's going
to be like George Young was to the Giants, Red Auerbach to the
Celtics. His legacy--he'll die being a basketball man, making moves.
Besides his wife and his family, that's what makes him get up every
morning. After them, it's basketball. When Karen gave him the nod
that she approved, that's all it took.</TE>
<TE>   "Taking the challenge didn't surprise anybody. He loves
challenges. When everybody said he couldn't make it big in the NBA,
when everybody said he couldn't make it as a great executive, he
showed everybody. And now everybody probably will say that he can't
do this, and he's going to show everybody again.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't hold him back. He wanted to have his own situation, his
own organization. He got that. He wanted to go where he could work
with young guys and build an organization. He got that. He wanted
another owner who was about winning. You don't leave Dr. Buss if the
other organization is not about winning. He would have never taken
this job unless [Heisley] said, 'I'm going to open my wallet, and
you've got full control. And I want to win.'"</TE>
<TE>   In Memphis, West is expected to retain former president Dick
Versace, who will serve out his three-year contract as general
manager, and Coach Sidney Lowe.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Colson, former basketball coach at Pepperdine, New Mexico and
Fresno State, has been hired by the Grizzlies to assist West. A
longtime friend of West, Colson has been an associate athletic
director at UC Santa Barbara for the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Is there room in Memphis for Johnson too? It's not out of the
question.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I going to go?" Johnson said, repeating the question.</TE>
<TE>   He laughed for several seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't talked to me about that yet," Johnson said. "Again, I
want to be involved with the NBA.... If there's anybody in basketball
I'd love to work for, it would be Jerry, because we've got the same
mind-set ... to outwork people. The thing that sets Jerry apart, he
can look at a guy and see what he's going to be like three years from
now."</TE>

<HD>Tempera, 2-Year-Old Filly Champion, Euthanized</HD>

<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Tempera, winner of last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and one
of the favorites for Friday's $500,000 Kentucky Oaks at Churchill
Downs, was euthanized at a clinic in nearby Lexington on Sunday night
because of complications from a fever that was discovered Friday.</LD>
<LD>   By Saturday, Tempera's condition hadn't improved and she was moved
from Churchill to the Hagyard-Davidson-McGee Veterinary Clinic, 70
miles away. At the clinic, Tempera also developed colitis and
laminitis, a circulatory hoof disease.</LD>
<LD>   "Her condition deteriorated rapidly [Sunday], and nothing could be
done to save her," said a statement from Sheik Mohammed's Dubai-based
Goldolphin Racing Inc., which announced the horse's death Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Tempera, a well-bred daughter of A.P. Indy and Colour Chart, a Mr.
Prospector mare, began her career in California with trainer Eoin
Harty. She won her first race in July at Hollywood Park and two races
later won the Breeders' Cup race at Belmont Park to clinch the
Eclipse Award for best 2-year-old filly.</TE>
<TE>   Tempera, like all of Sheik Mohammed's 2-year-olds, was sent back
to Dubai, where she finished second in a pair of races. After losing
to stablemate Imperial Gesture on April 13, she was shipped to
Kentucky to run in Friday's Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The mood was grim Monday around the barn at Churchill, where Tom
Albertrani, an assistant trainer, is supervising Sheik Mohammed's
horses. The stable still has Imperial Gesture to run in the Oaks and
will run Essence Of Dubai on Saturday in the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty shocking to see how [Tempera's] condition changed
within 24 hours," Albertrani said. "We took all the precautions. It's
upsetting for everybody. It's very depressing. It's hard to explain
how these things ever happen."</TE>
<TE>   Tempera had three victories, two seconds and two thirds in seven
starts and had earned $770,240.</TE>

<KH>NHL PLAYOFFS COLORADO 4, KINGS 0</KH>
<HD>The Av-Nots, Again</HD>
<DH>Game 7: Avalanche scores three times in second period and
routs L.A. in decisive game for second consecutive year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>This King season ended where the last one did.</LD>
<LD>   In the Pepsi Center.</LD>
<LD>   In disappointment.</LD>
<TE>   In a four-goal defeat.</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado Avalanche sent the Kings unhappily into the
off-season for the second consecutive year, closing out their
first-round Stanley Cup playoff series Monday night with a 4-0 Game 7
victory in front of 18,007.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche's 340th consecutive sellout crowd roared its
approval as the defending Stanley Cup champion scored three goals in
the second period, matching its total from the previous four games,
and stopped the Kings one victory short of completing an improbable
comeback from a 3-1 series deficit.</TE>
<TE>   At least last year, when they also erased a 3-1 series deficit to
necessitate a Game 7 against the Avalanche in the second round, the
Kings kept the game competitive into the third period before giving
up four goals in a 5-1 loss.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the Avalanche drained all suspense about the outcome by
scoring two goals in a span of 54 seconds about six minutes into the
second period, the first on an unforgettable individual effort by
center Chris Drury.</TE>
<TE>   If the Kings had any thought of getting back into the game after
that, Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy stripped them of it, stopping
23 shots for his second shutout of the series and league-record 21st
in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of credit to the Avalanche," King captain Mattias Norstrom
said. "I thought they played probably their best game of the series.
They came at us hard. They were the best team out there tonight, no
question about it....</TE>
<TE>   "They controlled the game from the drop of the puck.... It proves
why they became champions last year--they really step up when it
matters the most."</TE>
<TE>   Once again, though, the Kings did not.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously very disappointed," Coach Andy Murray said. "I
think our players are disappointed, I'm disappointed, we're all
disappointed. Certainly, we recognize the Avalanche is a tremendous
team.</TE>
<TE>   "We battled them hard, but we're still one game short."</TE>
<TE>   They were fighting long odds.</TE>
<TE>   Only 16 of the 190 teams that had lost three of the first four
games of a best-of-seven NHL playoff series, or about 8%, had rallied
to win the series. But the Kings were confident after winning Game 5
at Denver and Game 6 at Staples Center, putting some doubt, they
hoped, into the minds of the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   If the Kings were apprehensive about playing without injured
regulars Adam Deadmarsh and Philippe Boucher, sidelined because of
injuries and recuperating back home in Manhattan Beach, they weren't
about to let on.</TE>
<TE>   And, besides, they'd won the last two games without them.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche, meanwhile, was at full strength for the first time
since May, Peter Forsberg returning to the lineup after sitting out
Game 6 because of a leg injury and Milan Hejduk playing his second
game after returning from an abdominal strain.</TE>
<TE>   "First time in the entire season, for a big game, so this is a
good day for us," Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley said before the game.
"It's exciting....</TE>
<TE>   "We've been there for Game 7s before, so once again I'll put my
trust in my players--their character, their skills, the experience,
the leadership. I think it's certainly a big boost for us."</TE>
<TE>   After giving up nine goals in the first two games of the series,
4-3 and 5-3 losses, the Kings had given up only three in winning
three of the next four, their only loss a 1-0 setback in Game 4.
They'd killed 16 consecutive penalties, last giving up a power-play
goal in the first period of Game 2. Goaltender Felix Potvin's
goals-against average over the previous four games was 0.75, his save
percentage .972.</TE>
<TE>   But in the second period of Game 7, none of that mattered.</TE>
<TE>   Only seconds after the Avalanche had killed a penalty, Drury
carried the puck almost the length of the ice, slicing between
defenders Brad Chartrand and Jaroslav Modry along the way, before
lifting a shot into the net.</TE>
<TE>   "What a great effort," Hartley said. "The play of the game."</TE>
<TE>   The team that had scored first had won the last 13 playoff games
between the Kings and Avalanche, so Colorado was in great shape.</TE>
<TE>   It was in better shape 54 seconds later, when a shot by Hejduk
deflected off Jason Allison and into the left faceoff circle, where
Alex Tanguay pounced on it and slipped a shot past Potvin for a 2-0
lead. Potvin, bumped on the play by Joe Sakic, claimed goaltender
interference, but after a brief review the goal stood.</TE>
<TE>   Former King Steven Reinprecht made it 3-0 with his fourth goal of
the series, scoring on a rebound with 2:28 remaining in the period.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Foote added an empty-net goal with 3:13 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Roy stopped the Kings dead in their tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "You saw it out there, how good he was tonight--the saves he was
making, how he made everything look easy," King center Bryan
Smolinski said. "That's Patrick at his best. He gave us a few games,
and he took a few games away from us."</TE>
<TE>   Including the one that mattered most.</TE>
