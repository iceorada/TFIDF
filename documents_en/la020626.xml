<LD>It's 2054 and Officer John Anderton, on the run from fellow cops, is
fleeing in a wall-crawling magnetic-levitation car.</LD>
<LD>   But the car that actor Tom Cruise uses in Steven Spielberg's
just-opened "Minority Report" was built 53 years before the timeline
in the movie.</LD>
<LD>   It was done in 2001 for Lexus, a luxury brand eager to get its
cars in a featured movie role.</LD>
<TE>   The pod-shaped MagLev represents just one of a fleet of coveted
automotive product placements in new and upcoming Hollywood films.</TE>
<TE>   Lexus has two designs in the futuristic thriller--both fanciful
concept vehicles. One is the MagLev, the other a more conventional
sports car.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really about getting the Lexus name and brand out there in
front of folks who may never have considered a Lexus before," said
Nancy Hubbell, spokeswoman for the luxury division of Toyota Motor
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Lexus gets to be seen as a technology leader, using features
available today--including adaptive laser cruise control--as well as
imaginative future functions such as DNA recognition and
retina-scanning entry systems.</TE>
<TE>   At the premiere in Los Angeles this evening of "Men in Black II,"
moviegoers will see stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones--and the
all-new 2003 Mercedes-Benz E-Class, which goes on sale in the U.S. at
the end of summer. The tricked-out Mercedes is the MIB agents'
preferred ride in the new film.</TE>
<TE>   "There's high buzz potential that we hope will attract early
adopters and younger buyers," said Carol Goll, general manager for
brand events marketing for Mercedes-Benz USA.</TE>
<TE>   On July 26, when the third Austin Powers film opens, actor Mike
Myers will take to the streets in a Jaguar XK8--tarted up with a
red-white-and-blue Union Jack paint job.</TE>
<TE>   And actor Pierce Brosnan's Agent 007 will be reunited this fall
with Aston Martin, the exotic marque that actor Sean Connery drove at
the outset of the long-running James Bond movie franchise.</TE>
<TE>   A year from now actress Carrie-Anne Moss will engage in a gritty
chase scene in the sequel to the science fiction thriller "The
Matrix." She'll be driving a Cadillac Escalade EXT pickup, pursued by
bad guys in a Cadillac CTS sedan.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting Cadillacs in front of an aspirational crowd is exposure
you can't buy," said Susan Docherty, marketing director for the
Escalade, Cadillac's hot-selling SUV.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get a teenager to sit down and watch a bunch of
Cadillac commercials," she said. But the chase in "The Matrix
Reloaded," which will be released in spring 2003, amounts to an
extreme commercial teens are likely to eat up.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp., which makes Cadillacs, has a deal with
Warner Bros. that gives the world's largest auto maker first right of
refusal to provide cars and trucks for the studio's films.</TE>
<TE>   Cars have long had memorable roles in film. The 1949 Mercury that
James Dean was seen driving in "Rebel Without a Cause" (1955), James
Bond's Aston Martin DB5 in "Goldfinger" (1964), the Volkswagen Beetle
named Herbie in "The Love Bug" (1968) and Steve McQueen's 1968
Mustang GT in "Bullitt" (1968) are vivid examples.</TE>
<TE>   Cars get on screen in one of three ways: Auto makers lend vehicles
at filmmakers' requests, pay for product placement or enter
co-marketing agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes-Benz says it never pays for product placement. But with
"Men in Black II," it struck a marketing deal that includes Mercedes
commercials this summer that tie into the movie's tongue-in-cheek
theme of saving Earth from alien monsters.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler also is licensing use of the Mercedes
three-pointed star in a children's toy for the first time: a model
E-Class that morphs into a Strike Cruiser Vehicle, a space-going
rocket that lets the MIB agents in the film chase an alien spaceship.
The toy version, made by Hasbro, comes with an action figure of agent
Jay, played by Will Smith.</TE>
<TE>   It's the first major Mercedes vehicle placement in a film since
the M-Class sport utility vehicle figured prominently in "The Lost
World," the 1997 sequel to "Jurassic Park."</TE>
<TE>   For Aston Martin, the association with James Bond is priceless.</TE>
<TE>   "Bond's a great link for us. He started out in the DB5," said
Cristina Bruzzi, marketing manager for the Ford Motor Co.-owned
British marque.</TE>
<TE>   (In the original Bond books by the late Ian Fleming, the agent
started out with a supercharged Bentley.)</TE>
<TE>   Not that Aston Martin needs the publicity for the Vanquish that
Brosnan as Bond will drive in "Die Another Day." The 460-horsepower
V-12 sports car is sold out in the U.S. for the next two years--at a
sticker price of $228,000.</TE>
<TE>   But auto makers don't always believe it's in their interest to
cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   The makers of the 1995 film "Heat," starring Al Pacino and Robert
De Niro, wanted to borrow a Lincoln Town Car for De Niro's character,
a hardened gangster.</TE>
<TE>   Not eager to perpetuate the Town Car's image as a hoodlum's wheels
of choice, Lincoln parent Ford declined.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers went ahead and rented a Town Car anyway.</TE>

<HD>Good Time for Buyers as Incentive Fever Returns</HD>
<DH>Retailing* Shoppers who do some research and are willing to
compromise can find big savings. But there's a hitch--deals are
bigger, but so are prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you've been waiting, it's time to start shopping.</LD>
<LD>   After cutting back on incentives in May and watching sales sag,
auto makers have resumed piling on the deals. How long the good times
will last for shoppers is anyone's guess, but market watchers say
incentive fever could last into fall.</LD>
<LD>   While it does, buyers who do a little research and are willing to
compromise on issues such as exterior color or trim and equipment
levels can find substantial savings as the 2002 model lines peter
out.</LD>
<TE>   "The average discount on a new car in the first half of June was
$3,718," said Art Spinella, vice president of CNW Research, a Bandon,
Ore., market research firm that tracks auto industry incentive
spending.</TE>
<TE>   There's a little hitch, of course--but there is little about
buying a new car or truck that doesn't come with a hitch or two.</TE>
<TE>   Although incentives are getting bigger, so are prices. The average
manufacturer's suggested retail price, or MSRP, on new vehicles sold
during the first half of June was $26,002--the highest MSRP ever,
Spinella said. The average transaction price after negotiations and
incentives was $22,284, also a record high, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The incentives most consumers see are advertised deals--consumer
cash offers and discounted interest rates or lease terms. But auto
makers also try to boost sales by giving their dealers
incentives--which dealers can keep for themselves or pass on to
consumers as market conditions dictate.</TE>
<TE>   Shoppers who know about dealer incentives can bargain even harder.</TE>
<TE>   At General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division, for example, a
national promotion offers a cash rebate of $3,000 on the 2002 model
Eldorado. GM also is offering its dealers $7,000 for each 2001 model
Eldorado they move.</TE>
<TE>   That means that a bargain- hungry shopper who doesn't see much
difference between the two model years (and there isn't) could strike
a better deal going after an unsold '01 model.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, dealer cash and consumer cash can be combined: Hyundai
is offering as much as $1,500 cash back to buyers of its 2002 model
XG350 sedan. But dealers also are being offered $750 to $1,500 for
each new XG350 they move. A buyer who knows this could persuade a
hungry Hyundai retailer to pony up the dealer cash as well as the
customer rebate, cutting the price by a nifty $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   There are dozens of such deals to be made these days.</TE>
<TE>   GM, which has been successful in slashing production and operating
costs, is leading the incentive wars. The world's biggest car maker
is applying the savings to its incentives program instead of its
corporate profit to regain some of the market share it has lost
during the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   When GM was losing share, many believed the company was unable to
build decent cars. Now that its market share is rising, the buzz is
that GM is making a comeback with better cars and trucks. The company
can't afford to let its image slip by letting sales sag.</TE>
<TE>   And as GM has piled on the incentives to keep customers coming,
Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Group have been forced
to follow.</TE>
<TE>   "Incentives are now a permanent part of the industry," said Tom
Libby, Michigan-based director of industry analysis for auto
marketing consultant J.D. Power &amp; Associates. "They are a pricing
tool that manufacturers adjust to get demand to where they want it to
be."</TE>
<TE>   Even importers such as Honda Motor Co. and Mercedes-Benz that
don't advertise customer rebates--because to do so might hurt their
image--play the game. They just do it on limited models with dealer
incentives that dealers can use as they see fit.</TE>
<TE>   As Honda gets ready to launch an all-new Accord for 2003, some
dealers are using factory cash to offer $1,000 discounts on remaining
2002 Accords. Honda also has begun promoting a special low- interest
financing program on 2002 Accords and Civics--a rarity for the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes-Benz is offering dealers as much as $3,500 in cash for
each 2002 E-Class they sell.</TE>
<TE>   Many foreign auto makers have been able to avoid the incentive
wars because the strong dollar in the last year has permitted them to
compete with lower MSRPs. But the dollar now is weakening.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be interesting to see how the foreign companies respond,
and whether they will have to start playing the incentive game," said
Robert Schnorbus, chief economist at J.D. Power &amp; Associates.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Schnorbus said, shoppers interested in cars from the
domestic auto makers and from many importers "can find pretty
attractive deals."</TE>
<TE>   With the bulk of the 2003 models due to start pouring into
dealerships by late summer and early fall, there's no guarantee that
incentives will remain at present levels. Incentives typically fall
when new models hit the showrooms.</TE>
<TE>   And the selection of 2002 models is better now than it will be in
a few months, as factories stop building and dealer stocks dwindle in
anticipation of the '03 cars and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   "So if you need to buy a new vehicle," Schnorbus said, "there's no
reason to wait to see if better deals are coming."</TE>
<TE>   The best way to track rebates is online, where more than a dozen
sites offer rebate and incentive lists. Among them are Autobytel
.com; Autopedia.com; AutoSite .com; AutoWeb.com; Car-Incentives .com;
Carprice.com; Cars.com; Carsdirect.com; Digitalcars.com; Edmunds.com;
Intellichoice.com; Kelley Blue Book (kbb.com); and Newbuyer.com.</TE>

<TE>Motivational Techniques</TE>
<TE>Incentives are an integral part of the car-buying experience.
Dollar values change from model to model and from manufacturer
to manufacturer, but the idea is the same: to attract customers
and prop up sales volumes and market share. Here's a look at
average June consumer cash incentives as reported by 2,500
dealerships across the country:</TE>

<HD>Ford Recalls Thunderbird Over Seat Belt Concern</HD>
<DH>Safety* Isuzu and Honda SUVs and Dodge Ram pickups are the
subjects of other recent actions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As if delaying the launch of its long-anticipated Thunderbird for
several months last year because of quality glitches wasn't enough of
a headache, Ford Motor Co. has announced a recall of 16,500 of the
cars to fix a potential problem with the driver's seat belt.</LD>
<LD>   Ford representatives said the problem was detected after a 35-mph
frontal crash test conducted by federal safety regulators. The
driver-side seat belt was found to have been partially cut.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it had received no complaints about frayed or
partially cut seat belts since the two-seat roadsters went into
production last year.</LD>
<TE>   The repair involves revising the lower part of the seat so the
seat belts won't contact the metal seat hinge in a frontal crash. The
recall affects 2002 models made before April 24.</TE>
<TE>   In other recent recall news:</TE>
<TE>   * America Isuzu Motors has recalled 161,927 of its 1998 model
Amigo and Rodeo sport utility vehicles because the computer program
controlling the anti-lock braking may extend stopping distances in
certain cases.</TE>
<TE>   * American Honda Motor Co., which sells slightly modified Isuzu
Rodeos as Honda Passports, has recalled 52,934 of its 1998 Passports
for the same reason.</TE>
<TE>   Dealers will provide a replacement program that is based on the
programming used in ABS systems for 2000 and 2001 models of the same
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Isuzu and Honda said they would notify affected customers by mail.</TE>
<TE>   * DaimlerChrysler has recalled 46,000 of its 2002 model Dodge Ram
four-wheel-drive pickups because a brake line could separate from the
caliper, causing loss of braking power.</TE>
<TE>   Dealers will reinforce the brake assembly to prevent brake line
separation.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My introduction to whiplash occurred 16 years ago when a carload of
rambunctious teenagers plowed into the back of my car at a busy
intersection.</LD>
<LD>   I'll never forget the dreadful moment before impact when I looked
in the rearview mirror and saw that the driver and his friends were
having so much fun they hadn't noticed traffic had come to a stop.</LD>
<LD>   My car was totaled, and the next morning I felt as if I'd been hit
by a big-rig truck. I wore a neck brace for nearly a week.</LD>
<TE>   Close to 1 million people a year suffer painful whiplash injuries,
caused when the neck whips violently back and forth in vehicle
accidents, most often involving rear-end collisions.</TE>
<TE>   It's an injury that continues to occur even though head restraints
have been required in the U.S. since 1969. Whiplash injuries cost the
insurance industry about $7 billion a year in claims, said Russ
Rader, spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in
Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, studies have shown that as many as 43% of those injured
may suffer long-term chronic problems, including neck pain, stiffness
and headaches.</TE>
<TE>   Vehicle head restraints--often called headrests and erroneously
positioned to be used as pillows instead of safety devices--are key
to preventing whiplash injuries.</TE>
<TE>   But not all of them are designed well enough to provide proper
protection. Indeed, poorly designed head restraints actually can
increase the risk of whiplash, said Rader, whose institute is
supported by the insurance industry.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that the auto industry and the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration are working to provide better head
restraint protection. NHTSA is in the process of proposing new head
restraint standards to replace those that have been around for 30
years.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the new standards would require auto makers to design
safer headrests that are positioned higher and closer to the back of
seat occupants' heads than is the case in many current models.</TE>
<TE>   The Insurance Institute will step up its research this year when
it begins using crash dummies for the first time in simulated
rear-end accidents to determine how effective different head
restraints are in reducing neck injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Restraints that offer the best protection, Rader said, are those
that reach to at least the top of the seat occupant's ears and are
positioned as close to the back of the head as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Designs that leave more than four inches of space between the
restraint and the back of the seat occupant's head have been
associated with increased likelihood of neck injury in crashes, the
institute has found.</TE>
<TE>   The research group's top ratings go to "active" head restraint
systems designed to move into a protective position. In the event of
a rear impact, active restraints move closer to the back of the
occupant's head to prevent it from snapping back and injuring the
neck.</TE>
<TE>   The institute's head restraint rating system, begun in 1995,
measures the devices in relation to head position and evaluates them
as "good," "acceptable," "marginal" or "poor." The institute last
published ratings of all vehicle head restraints in 2001 but has
begun releasing new ratings for '02 models. Those available can be
obtained at www.hwysafety.org.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, more than half the vehicles earned either "good" or
"acceptable" evaluations.</TE>
<TE>   Among those with "good" ratings this year are the Infiniti I30 and
Q45, Buick LeSabre, Oldsmobile Aurora, Saab 9-3 and 9-5, Pontiac
Bonneville and all Volvo models. All have active restraints.</TE>
<TE>   Some models' restraint ratings can change even though the basic
vehicle doesn't: The Ford Taurus, for instance, earned a "good" last
year but dropped to "marginal" for 2002, Rader said.</TE>
<TE>   And ratings can range within a single model line, depending on
trim levels. The Ford Windstar minivan, for example, earns restraint
ratings that range from "good" to "marginal," depending on the type
of seat offered.</TE>
<TE>   Most pickups and sport utility vehicles have head restraints with
"marginal" or "poor" ratings, although a few, such as Honda's
redesigned CR-V, scored better in 2002. The Honda went from the worst
rating last year to the best this year. Typically--although not
always--ratings improve when a vehicle is redesigned and updated.</TE>
<TE>   And although there still are too many vehicles with marginal or
poor head restraints, the most recent ratings do show that the
industry is improving, said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of
the Center for Auto Safety.</TE>
<TE>   Just five years ago, the institute found that more than half of
all new passenger vehicles had poorly designed head restraints that
offered inadequate neck protection.</TE>
<TE>   Only five vehicles in 1997 earned a "good" head restraint rating
from the institute.</TE>
<TE>   Experts insist that whatever the auto industry does to improve
head restraints, drivers and passengers also must take responsibility
for reducing whiplash injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have shown that more than half of all drivers don't bother
to safely adjust their head restraints. In fact, many people seem
oblivious to the fact that head restraints are important safety
features, Rader said.</TE>
<TE>   Take it from someone who knows: A bout with whiplash and a week
with a cervical collar probably would enlighten them.</TE>

<LD>Seven-year old Ashley Hernandez was born deaf, a hereditary condition
she shares with both her mother and father. Unfortunately, the three
haven't had many opportunities to sign with one another. When Ashley
was 3, she was found alone wandering on La Habra Boulevard and
someone called the police, according to her grandmother, Rita
Hernandez. "Her mother was drunk, and Ashley was taken away in a
police car."</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez, a 58-year-old Montebello homemaker, stepped forward to
care for Ashley and her two older (hearing) brothers while both of
their parents wrestled with alcohol and drug abuse problems. Still,
the social workers wanted to place Ashley in a foster home with a
deaf family. Hernandez fought to keep the child, and a judge allowed
her to adopt Ashley and her brothers.</LD>
<TE>   When Hernandez was raising Ashley's mom, the emphasis in educating
hearing-impaired children was on lip-reading and speech rather than
signing. Consequently, Hernandez never learned to sign and is only
now taking classes. She worried that Ashley, who during the school
year lives at the California School for the Deaf in Riverside,
wouldn't have children to communicate with during the summer. So she
sought out the Lions Wilderness Camp for Deaf Children in Wrightwood.
Ashley will attend this camp for the first time thanks to the
Catholic Big Brothers Big Sisters organization and donations to the
Los Angeles Times summer camp campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Here at home, I take her to birthday parties, but they are all
hearing children. I can see that she has fun, but she would have more
fun around deaf people," said Hernandez. "I can see she feels less
doubt around them."</TE>
<TE>   On the weekends, Ashley sometimes sees her father and mother.
Hernandez supervises both parents during visits to make sure they are
not under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The experiences with her parents have hardened Ashley, according
to her grandmother. "Ashley can be mean. She'll push a child, but
that is what she's seen in her life," said Hernandez, referring to
domestic trouble between Ashley's parents. "If she falls and hurts
herself, she won't cry."</TE>
<TE>   Jane Armstrong, the director of a program for the deaf and hard of
hearing for Catholic Big Brothers Big Sisters, hopes that camp will
be a chance for Ashley to let go of some of her past and focus on the
positive influences. "I think life has been hard for her, but she has
enough people who care about her that it is OK."</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1954, readers and employees of The Times have
sent thousands of needy children to summer camp.</TE>
<TE>   This year more than 11,000 children will experience a special
summer thanks to the $1.6 million raised last year.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of sending a child to camp for a week is $150.
This year, the McCormick Tribune Foundation will match the first $1.2
million in contributions at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Checks should be sent to: L.A. Times Summer Camp Campaign, File
No. 56984, Los Angeles, CA 90074-6984. For more information, call
(213) 237-5771. To make credit card donations, visit
www.latimes.com/summercamp. Do not send cash.</TE>
<TE>   All donations are tax-deductible. Unless donors request otherwise,
gifts of $25 or more are acknowledged in The Times. The summer camp
campaign is part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the
McCormick Tribune Foundation.</TE>

<HD>Star-Crossed Cathedral</HD>
<DH>Controversy has surrounded Our Lady of the Angels, and its
scheduled opening threatens to increase the focus on larger problems
in the Catholic Church</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even under the best of circumstances, the Cathedral of Our Lady of
the Angels looked as if it might be a tough sell. Rising above the
Hollywood Freeway in downtown Los Angeles, the nearly $200-million
edifice is an imposing mass of modern design, a resolutely 21st
century building wedded to the tenets of an old and tradition-minded
faith. Though some observers have praised the spare elegance of
architect Jose Rafael Moneo's work, others have derided the
cathedral's high price tag and lamented an austere, abstract style
that has put some observers in mind of an industrial plant.</LD>
<LD>   To its most persistent critics, the cathedral-in-progress
epitomizes the egotism and arrogance of Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and
the aloofness of a Roman Catholic archdiocese they felt had turned
its back on its core mission by abandoning its former skid row
location for a fancy new address. The weekly alternative newspaper
New Times has dubbed it "the Taj Mahony," a phrase that has stuck in
local op-ed pages.</LD>
<TE>   Yet these controversies pale in comparison to the child sex-abuse
scandal that's shaking the U.S. Catholic Church to its foundations.
Now, with the cathedral's anticipated opening less than three months
away, some believe that Our Lady of the Angels could become an
embarrassingly high-profile focus for the larger problems of the
Catholic Church. At best, they suggest, the cathedral may be seen as
an unlucky victim of terrible timing, at worst as a costly 11-story
fig leaf trying to camouflage the shame of its spiritual custodians.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a compromised building as a consequence of the crisis in the
church," says author D.J. Waldie, whose book "Holy Land: A Suburban
Memoir" ( W.W. Norton, 1996) describes growing up Catholic in postwar
Southern California. "It had been presented to Catholics in the
diocese and to non-Catholics as well as a place of refuge, a bulwark,
an encircling wall that would provide shelter. And now the question
is, shelter for whom and shelter against what?"</TE>
<TE>   Mark Silk, director of the Leonard E. Greenberg Center for the
Study of Religion In Public Life at Trinity College in Hartford,
Conn., says the main issue isn't the cathedral per se, but the man
who has been its principal visionary and booster: Mahony. Since
victims of alleged sexual abuse by priests began coming forward en
masse in the past few months, it has been disclosed that more than 30
current or former L.A. priests in the archdiocese are under
investigation by legal authorities. Mahony has been criticized for
transferring a priest to other L.A. parishes after the priest had
allegedly admitted to molesting young boys.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you were asking people who were paying close attention
to this they would say, 'Well, Mahony's having some problems, but
he's basically on the right side,' " Silk says. "The extent to which
that's true and the extent to which that's true in September," when
the cathedral is scheduled to be inaugurated will determine whether
"the opening of the cathedral is attended with celebrations or with
picketing."</TE>
<TE>   Church's Urgent Issues</TE>
<TE>   Part of what makes the cathedral's situation unusual, some say, is
that it is virtually critic-proof.The cathedral and its owners are
not directly answerable to popular will or external political
pressures.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what additional misdeeds may be revealed in the coming
weeks, no one is likely to demand that the cathedral opening should
be canceled and the new building disassembled and sold off in pieces
to pay victims' compensation. On the contrary, the cathedral looks as
physically solid as Fort Knox, having been engineered to withstand
anything short of a catastrophic earthquake. (St. Vibiana, the
cathedral's predecessor, was severely damaged by the Northridge
earthquake.)</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has expressed hope that the cathedral will endure for
several hundred years. "The building cannot be effaced," says Waldie.
"Its dedication cannot be effaced."</TE>
<TE>   But just because the cathedral will probably be around for a long
time doesn't make the issues surrounding it now any less urgent. "In
an institution that's 2,000 years old, all present views are short
views," says Waldie. "One often hears Rome saying, 'This too shall
pass, and given 250 years, 500 years, it will all seem not of
consequence.' That ought not to diminish our realization that every
small element, every small brick in the wall connects to that
history, to that long history."</TE>
<TE>   Others, without minimizing the seriousness of the pedophilia
scandal, question how much it will taint or detract from the
cathedral's opening, which had been scheduled to be marked with
several days of celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Catholics are in some ways stronger in their faith in the
church than anybody thinks," says Gregory Rodriguez, a political
commentator and senior fellow with the New America Foundation in
Washington, D.C. "We'd be a little silly to predict the end of
Catholicism in America. We'd be silly to think that the scandal would
somehow ruin the structure that intends or pretends to be the center
of Los Angeles Catholicism."</TE>
<TE>   Among Latinos, who make up 70% of L.A. Catholics, religious folk
traditions and devotions are in many ways more important than
bricks-and-mortar expressions of the faith, Rodriguez says. "Mexican
Catholicism is not as institutionally oriented" as, say its Irish
American counterpart, he asserts, adding that curbside shrines,
street processions of mariachis honoring the Virgin of Guadalupe and
other "public manifestations of faith" versus those "behind church
doors" tend to characterize Latino Catholicism in the United States.
"If your faith in God is anchored solely on the church, then you're
in trouble at this point," Rodriguez says.</TE>
<TE>   Accessibility Emphasized</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the dictates of Second Vatican Council reforms,
Our Lady of the Angels was designed to convey a greater sense of
accessibility and openness than had been customary in Catholic
churches. For example, the altar of the new cathedral will be partly
encircled by parishioners, making priests seem less distant while
performing Mass and giving congregants a greater sense of
participation in the ritual.</TE>
<TE>   Using natural light as a substitute for ornamentation, a Moneo
signature, the new cathedral will be without much of the overt
religious symbolism and architectural proselytizing found in earlier
generations of buildings. Though a limited number of artworks have
been commissioned, there will be no great stained-glass narratives
and only minimal images of saints and biblical stories and other
iconography. To an unusual extent, those entering the cathedral will
be invited to fill the space with their own imaginations.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has said that he wants the cathedral to serve not only as a
house of worship for the faithful but also as a semipublic space
where Angelenos of different faiths will gather on major civic
occasions and be welcome throughout the year. In this way, the
cathedral could have multiple functions and identities.</TE>
<TE>   For those outside the Catholic faith, the church's current
problems ultimately may have little bearing on how they perceive
Moneo's building. "I think many people will go to the cathedral as if
it were the new Getty, to see it as a work of art," says Nancy
Berman, museum director emeritus and curator at large at the Skirball
Cultural Center, which recently hosted a lecture-discussion on
creating sacred space at the new cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   Father Virgilio Elizondo, former director of San Fernando
Cathedral in San Antonio, Texas, and a professor at the Mexican
American Cultural Center in San Antonio, suggests that Our Lady of
the Angels actually might be seen by the faithful as a symbol of
renewal. "The symbol of the old cathedral [St. Vibiana's] was an
earthquake," he says. "You might compare the crisis in the church
right now to an earthquake. So maybe this could be worked around the
theme of a new beginning."</TE>
<TE>   With thousands of passersby having watched the cathedral take
shape over the past several years, anticipation alone may be enough
to ensure that Angelenos and visitors from around the world will want
to visit the building and judge for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Just practically you wouldn't think you'd want to plan the
opening at this time, but then, who knows? It might be a great boost
to the morale of the Catholic population," says Father Clint
Albertson, a professor at Loyola Marymount University.</TE>
<TE>   But others say it will take more than rituals and architectural
metaphors to make Our Lady of the Angels feel welcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Given what he calls the church's "cover-up" over priests' sexual
misconduct, Tom Glynn, pastor of Holy Trinity Church in San Pedro,
believes it's more important than ever that the church demonstrate
its willingness to deal with the scandal, to show "that we've totally
turned the church upside down." That includes Our Lady of the Angels.
"If it becomes a very expensive, elite, inaccessible building, then I
think we're really in trouble," Glynn says.</TE>
<TE>   Waldie echoes that view. "You can't plaster over, paper over, put
a spin on the stories permanently we tell each other," he says. "And
in the pews, the story already is ingrained. In the pews, Catholics
wrestle with the reality that some of their beloved pastors have been
evil men. The tragedy would come if the building and its liturgies
remain stubbornly unaware of how Catholics in the pews have already
begun to incorporate that wound into their piety, their faith. We're
already doing that work, and the liturgists need to start doing that
too."</TE>
<TE>   A Cathedral's Significance</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the prominence and expense of the new cathedral may make
such a reckoning unavoidable. In decades past, says Trinity College's
Silk, Catholic parishes in the United States used large churches and
cathedrals to make powerful public statements, not only about faith
but also about the rising social stature of their then-largely
immigrant Irish, German, Italian and other Western European
parishioners. Like St. Patrick's Cathedral on 5th Avenue in New York,
Our Lady of the Angels is positioning itself near the center of civic
life. With that prominence comes greater public scrutiny and
accountability, Silk says.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were the public relations firm for the archdiocese, I would
be looking around for the patron saint of hurt children and dedicate
a side chapel to that saint," Silk says. "I'm not entirely un-serious
about that, but the question is whether the people would regard that
as sincere or simply public relations."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the gathering of Roman Catholic bishops in Dallas
earlier this month, and to Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, president of the
U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Silk continued, "I think real
action wasn't addressed in Dallas, in spite of some good words from
Rev. Gregory, and won't be without some resignations of the people
involved. Because nobody's willing to take the fall."</TE>
<TE>   Between now and September, Silk predicts, a great deal will depend
on the cardinal himself as to whether Our Lady of the Angels
ultimately will be viewed as "Mahony's tomb or a statement of greater
glory to come."</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever happens, I can't imagine it's just going to be a pure
love-fest and celebration of Angeleno Catholicism that people a year
ago might've dreamed," he concludes. "It's going to be a much more
complicated procedure."</TE>

<LD>So here I am writing my dad's column for him again, while he's off on
vacation.</LD>
<LD>   "Where you going, Dad?" I asked him.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm getting my head feng-shuied," he said, which I guess is that
ancient Chinese art of arranging the male brain so as to bring you
good luck, sort of like with furniture and stuff.</LD>
<TE>   "While you're at it, get a haircut," my mom told him, and he
climbed in the minivan and headed up the I-5 with my spoiled little
brother.</TE>
<TE>   Before he left, my dad yelled at me and my brother for leaving all
sorts of junk in the car and basically treating it like our own
personal Dumpster.</TE>
<TE>   Dad says 30% of a person's life is spent putting things where they
belong and throwing out candy wrappers.</TE>
<TE>   According to him, there are basically only two types of people:
those who throw things away and those who don't.</TE>
<TE>   "Which type are we, Daddy?" my dopey little sister asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Guess," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The good kind?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a minivan, not a garbage dump," my dad scolded us.</TE>
<TE>   "Why can't it be both, Dad?" I said, which made my little sister
giggle.</TE>
<TE>   See, I took freshman-level philosophy last semester and they teach
you to question things, like about life and stuff. Believe me, you
have to be philosophical when you're a teenager living with your
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be a wise guy," my dad said when I questioned him about the
minivan.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a girl, Dad. Remember?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I guess you're right," he said, and climbed into his
minivan and took off.</TE>
<TE>   My dad, he's the only person I know who lives vicariously through
himself. You're supposed to live vicariously through other people,
right? Not him. My mom says all men are really little boys and they
don't change much after age 2. Or 12. I forget which.</TE>
<TE>   "You're never too old to be immature," my dad is always saying,
which is something he picked up from one of his mouthy friends, I
think.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom, that's so scary," I tell her.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, just wait 20 years," she says.</TE>
<TE>   My dad's actually going on this river-rafting trip that he was
talked into by his friend Bill. Dad says that's another reason not to
have too many lawyer friends, on account of they're always talking
you into things you would totally never do.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, De Soto, have a nice trip!" I told him when he pulled out of
the driveway.</TE>
<TE>   I think Hernando De Soto is the dude who explored the Mississippi
River. That's the guy, right? All I can say is that I sure hope my
dad discovers a river. Any river. Even a creek.</TE>
<TE>   "He could use his own waterway," I tell my mom.</TE>
<TE>   "He could use something," my mom says.</TE>
<TE>   I like it when my mom's sarcastic. It reminds me of my friends
back at college, whom I really miss.</TE>
<TE>   My friends, they say that after you've been away at college, it's
really hard to live at home again, because you have to retrain your
parents about what teenagers are like and stuff. I'm finding out
that's totally true. As parents get older, they're harder to train.
Some won't listen at all.</TE>
<TE>   Like, my mom keeps trying to give me curfews. Curfews! Can you
believe curfews? I've been away at college for a whole entire year,
and she's giving me curfews?</TE>
<TE>   "I want you home by 1," she says almost every night.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom, this is L.A.," I always tell her.</TE>
<TE>   "You're right," she says. "Make it midnight."</TE>
<TE>   Midnight? A lot of the good clubs, they don't even open till
midnight. Not that I'd ever go to a club or anything. My dad, he'd
kill me if I ever went to some nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be an idiot," he says every time I leave the house at
night.</TE>
<TE>   "That's pretty limiting, Dad," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be a wise guy either," he says and goes back to his Fortune
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Jeeesh.</TE>
<TE>   But a lot of good stuff has happened since I came home from
college, too. Last week, I joined the Columbia House DVD Club, and I
got, like, four free DVDs without paying a cent. It's the best deal
in history if you ask me, which you probably wouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   My dad says I'll be paying for those four DVDs my whole life, and
after that, my heirs will be paying for those four DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   "For 80 years, you'll be sending little cards to Terre Haute,
Ind." he says.</TE>
<TE>   "So?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Every month," he says, "for 80 years."</TE>
<TE>   "So?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   See, that college philosophy stuff really paid off.</TE>
<TE>   Then my dad starts griping about the price of organic milk and how
the cost of stamps is going up again and how come there are three
opened packages of lunch meat in the refrigerator. Big deal, three. I
have to tell you, being a dad today sure must be exciting.</TE>
<TE>   "Organic milk?" he says. "Why do we even need organic milk?"</TE>
<TE>   "So you'll grow up to be healthy and strong," my mom teases him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm already healthy and strong," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "So I've noticed," she says, then kisses him on his hairy,
middle-aged neck, like he's a Greek fisherman or something.</TE>
<TE>   Jeeesh. Is it like this for everyone when they come home from
college? Give me dorm food any day. Give me sarcasm.</TE>
<TE>   My dad says that since I went away to college, I've really
changed. He says I'm like this female Holden Caulfield character,
except with more of an attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?" I said, just to bug him.</TE>
<TE>   "Holden Caulfield," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The inventor of organic milk?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, that's the guy," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Jeeesh.</TE>
<TE>   Is it September yet?</TE>

<HD>Darkness Lite in L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The other day I realized one of my headlights had gone dark. I only
noticed this because as I was pulling into my garage one night, the
light reflected off the back wall seemed lopsided. Being an Irish
Catholic woman, I immediately assumed I had been struck blind in one
eye. But no, I could see everything else just fine.</LD>
<LD>   I got out of the car and, sure enough, only one light was working.
Who knows when it happened? I could have driven obliviously
one-beamed for weeks, or until a police officer noticed. Headlights
may be legally required, but they're basically unnecessary in Los
Angeles. Because it doesn't ever really get dark in L.A.</LD>
<LD>   The headlight must have blown sometime after my family's recent
vacation up the coast. We stayed for a week in Big Sur, and it does
get dark in Big Sur. Alarmingly so. Driving the voluptuous curves of
Highway 1 through the redwoods and along the palisades in the daytime
was great fun--add a little Celtic harp and we were in modern film
noir, do a half-way decent Jonathan Pryce imitation and suddenly we
were a TV spot for VW.</LD>
<TE>   At night, however, it was a different, jaw-tightening story. Not
only did the road seem more perilous, but to a city dweller, darkness
becomes another matter. It crowds you somehow, lurks and follows,
pushes against window and door, wiping away landmarks and time
itself. You could wind up any place in any time. The only weapon you
have is your headlights sweeping a path in front of you, keeping you
safe just long enough to go 10 feet, then 10 more.</TE>
<TE>   I had not realized how unused I had become to the dark. Where I
grew up, it was very dark at night. There were no streetlights near
our house; town was miles away and hardly large enough to light up
its own sky much less that of the farmland that surrounded it. When
we drove, we regularly used our high beams; the dull click of
switching from high to low to high again as we approached a car was
the syncopation of the night, although you could go for miles without
passing another driver. I did not find the dark any more startling or
disconcerting then than I did the malicious rattle of sleet on the
window in the winter or the sound of faraway gunfire during hunting
season.</TE>
<TE>   But for years now, I have lived in a city where gunfire means
something very different, where sleet would mark the apocalypse and
the night is never truly dark. The sky over our house glows with
Glendale in the north and downtown L.A. in the south. The surface
streets I travel at night are all well-lighted, as are the freeways,
if not by actual lamps, then simply by the aura of the civilization
that surrounds them, by the billboards and the buildings and the
other cars streaming past.</TE>
<TE>   There are places not so far from the city where, no doubt, the
dark is deep and true--the canyons certainly, perhaps portions of the
foothills or even the last line of beachside homes. But for the most
part, Angelenos live with nights that are silvery black at best.</TE>
<TE>   And after a while, it seems completely normal, just as the sunlit
winter nights seem normal to those who live in more northern
latitudes. Until we venture to places where there is no night light
save the moon, and the dark often shoves even that aside. Driving
through such a night in Big Sur, I was grateful for the illumination
that seems so superfluous at home, where the headlights so often
outnumber the stars.</TE>

<HD>The Persistence of Memory</HD>
<DH>Though many publishers passed, the memoirs of Holocaust
survivors will now see the light of day</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS BEALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elie Wiesel had a mission: to see that the memoirs of Holocaust
survivors made it into print. But the Nobel Peace Prize winner and
author couldn't find anyone--not mainstream publishers, not even
Jewish organizations--who wanted to take on the task.</LD>
<LD>   Wiesel says this situation reflects what happened right after
World War II, when "nobody wanted to publish these stories. They were
too sad, too morbid. Then, at one point, there were too many. Because
there were programs about the Holocaust on TV, and conferences, it
became a popular subject. But there has been a feeling over the last
10 years that the marketplace has become saturated. So they say
unless it's a bestseller, they don't want to publish it."</LD>
<LD>   But Wiesel had connections and wasn't afraid to use them. Thanks
to the clout he has with his publisher, Random House, he received a
$1-million grant from the firm to begin a nonprofit publishing
venture to issue Holocaust memoirs. The first 12 of these books will
be released over the next three years under the aegis of the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<TE>   Will these books be widely read? It is still highly unlikely. Even
though first-person accounts, such as Wiesel's "Night" or Primo
Levi's "Survival in Auschwitz," have proven successful in the past,
the pain and horror of most of these memoirs is simply too much for
the average reader to take. And there is a numbing sameness to many
of them that does not add to the reading experience. Hence the
reluctance of mainstream publishers to add them to their lists.</TE>
<TE>   "After you've read the early or more distinguished ones, people
don't want to read these accounts anymore," says Publishers Weekly
executive editor Daisy Maryles. "Unless there's something new or
unusual, which you're not going to find anymore, the actual audience
will not be that vast."</TE>
<TE>   "These are documents that do not have a commercial value," says
Menachem Rosensaft, a New York securities lawyer and family friend of
Wiesel's who is editing the series. "We are hoping that works that
are not commercially publishable might become available to those
historians and students of the Holocaust who want to read them, and
become available to libraries and also be used in classroom
curricula."</TE>
<TE>   It's not that there haven't been plenty of books published about
the Holocaust. A search on Amazon.com using the term "Holocaust" came
up with some 5,000 hits. Yet the "final solution" has been mined so
relentlessly that without a completely new take on the subject,
publishers will not be interested. A controversial work like Daniel
Goldhagen's 1997 book "Hitler's Willing Executioners," which
purported to show how Hitler could have enlisted so many Germans to
participate in the Holocaust, can manage to break through this
clutter. But projects like that one do not come along every day.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't have the freedom when we take on 150 books a year
to take on a lot of books that have a very low sales potential," says
Jonathan Segal, a vice president at Alfred A. Knopf, a Random House
subsidiary. Segal is Wiesel's editor, and is acting as a liaison
between Random House and the Holocaust project. The memoir writers,
he says, "are not professionals; this is a historical and human
resource. If you're going to judge them against Gabriel Garcia
Marquez, that's a false analogy. We have to be realistic sometimes in
what their appeal to the marketplace might be."</TE>
<TE>   The project, known formally as the Holocaust Survivors' Memoirs
Project of the World Jewish Congress, was launched in 2000. Thanks to
the media publicity, Rosensaft received more than 750 manuscripts
from survivors living in the U.S., Israel, Latin America, Germany and
other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the memoirs were in English but Rosensaft, who read more
than 500 of them himself, also plowed through works in Yiddish,
German, Spanish and French. Reading them all, he says, was "at the
same time heart-wrenching and tremendously inspirational. You read
about individuals not only facing death, but facing and coping with
the murder of their families and the most horrendous form of
persecution and oppression. At the same time, you read about their
commitment to living, the ability to find the strength to survive, to
save others and help them to survive."</TE>
<TE>   Wiesel and Rosensaft agreed that the first volumes to be published
should reflect a wide range of experiences, including some that had
not been written about before. So, while the finalists naturally
include memoirs of people who survived the Jewish ghettos and the
death camps, there are also tales told by a Jewish woman who was
dropped from the 1936 German Olympic team; a woman whose mother was a
German convert to Judaism and managed to keep her entire family alive
in Germany during the war; and a man who is one of the few survivors
of Sobibor, a death camp in Poland in which hundreds of inmates
successfully revolted against their captors.</TE>
<TE>   Are they literary? Wiesel says, "I am not looking for literary
quality. I am looking for truth. The literature of the Holocaust has
its own quality. It is a very specific area of literary creation."</TE>
<TE>   Rosensaft adds that the 12 books are of "extremely good
communicative merit. They are well-written, but the important thing
is that the story is told. They were among the masses. And it is
literally the perspective of an individual experiencing the Holocaust
not as being in a leadership position, but being one of the
millions."</TE>
<TE>   The initial press run for the books will be relatively small,
somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 copies. They will be sold at the
U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Judaica stores and possibly on
Internet outlets like Amazon.com.</TE>
<TE>   The publication of these 12 volumes is only the first part of the
project. Rosensaft envisions an anthology consisting of excerpts from
other memoirs, and possibly making all 750 manuscripts available
online to scholars and students.</TE>
<TE>   But there are thousands of survivors with memories and manuscripts
in their closets. The project's creators would like to publish as
many as possible, something which Rosensaft says is "our moral
obligation to the survivors."</TE>
<TE>   More important, adds Rosensaft, the memoirs will be of key value
to future generations because "the study of the Holocaust will become
a critical element in the understanding of human nature, the
understanding of evil and how to cope with evil. The experience of
the survivors is essentially the coping with evil."</TE>

<HD>A City Dweller's 2-Year, 620-Mile Commute--One Way</HD>
<DH>What began as jogs home from work evolved into a
determination to explore neighborhoods--on foot</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNDSEY LAYTON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Michael Bryant likes to take the long way home.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington, D.C., resident has run home from every station on
the Metro system, a private odyssey that took two years to complete
and ended last week when he ran six miles from the last subway
station on his list, Clarendon in Virginia, to his home in the
District of Columbia neighborhood of Columbia Heights.</LD>
<LD>   "I just wanted to make running a little more interesting," said
Bryant, 37, a computer systems manager for a Capitol Hill think tank,
who estimates that he put 620 miles on his size 11 Nike Pegasus
running shoes.</LD>
<TE>   At first, Bryant ran home just from stations in the city; he
wanted to explore neighborhoods he wouldn't normally see in the
routine orbit of home and workplace. He ran down glass-strewn streets
he'd heard about in crime reports, through blue-collar neighborhoods
lined with neat gardens, past million-dollar homes with shiny cars
behind gated driveways.</TE>
<TE>   Once he began crossing off city stations on the Metro map pinned
to his office wall, Bryant figured he might as well do the whole
thing.</TE>
<TE>   In the mornings, he commuted on Metro from Columbia Heights to
Union Station, a short walk from his office. In the evenings, he
changed from work clothes to running togs and boarded a train to one
of the 83 Metro stations, spread across 103 miles.</TE>
<TE>   He did this two or three times a week, year-round. In 25 degrees
and in 85 degrees. In the watermelon light of a summer evening and in
the pitch dark of a winter's night. In prosperous upper Northwest,
where runners are common, Bryant was ignored. But in other places,
the thin, bespectacled man drew attention. Small children trotted
alongside him for a block or two; adults asked why he was running.
One teenager spotted Bryant and shouted "Run, Forrest, run!"--a line
from the movie "Forrest Gump."</TE>
<TE>   "He's methodical, detail-oriented and a little bit obsessive, but
in a good way," said Randi Blank, a high school friend. "When he
turned 20, he ran 20 miles. That's just the way he is."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant tried to fit in some errands to enliven his commute. He
visited any number of branches of his bank. He bought an iron skillet
at the Williams-Sonoma store near the Friendship Heights station and
ran home with it in his backpack, clanging against his shoulders. He
would help Blank, who is looking to buy a home, by doing a "run by"
past houses for sale to inspect their condition.</TE>
<TE>   To map the runs, Bryant tried to follow the most direct route but
often indulged his impulses to wander off course. He came across an
old Jewish cemetery in one neighborhood and a red fox in a ravine in
another. None of the runs was truly scenic, he said, especially those
along neon highways that seemed steeped in diesel smoke, but they
were always interesting.</TE>
<TE>   After a year, he found himself in good enough shape to complete
his first marathon, but soon after, suffered knee problems that
slowed his progress on the Metro project.</TE>
<TE>   But he never gave up.</TE>
<TE>   Not even as Metro opened five new stations, adding dozens of miles
to his journey. "I really wanted to finish it, to get the project
done," he said. "If I didn't finish it soon, I figured eventually
they'd start to extend the Orange Line toward Dulles and then I'd
really be in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   A colleague from work, Matt Broaddus, accompanied Bryant on about
10 of the runs. "I thought of it as an adventure," Broaddus said. But
most of the time, Bryant was alone.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday's final run, four colleagues accompanied Bryant. When
they reached his front stoop about 40 minutes later, a red finish
line awaited them, and Bryant burst through the tape in a victorious
lunge. He talked about his next idea: to run every street in the
District, all 11,000 miles of asphalt, with one exception. "I think
I'll stay off the Southwest-Southeast Freeway," he said.</TE>

<LD>Calling Long Distance</LD>
<LD>   Did you know that NASA is still in touch with spacecraft it
launched nearly 25 years ago? Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 took off into
space way back in 1977. Their missions were to fly close by the
Jupiter and Saturn planetary systems. Voyager 2 also flew by Uranus
and Neptune. They finished their missions in 1989, but the two
spacecraft were in such great shape that scientists allowed them to
continue. Now they're billions of miles from Earth, traveling toward
the outer reaches of our solar system.</LD>
<LD>   The Deep Space Network uses groups of gigantic antennas in three
locations around the world to talk to the spacecraft every day. One
of the groups of antennas is in California's Mojave Desert and is
named for nearby Goldstone Dry Lake; another is near Madrid, Spain.
The third is near Canberra, Australia. Messages between the DSN and
Voyager 1 travel at the speed of light and take nearly 12 hours to go
each way. By comparison, sending a signal to the Mars Global
Surveyor, in orbit around Mars, only takes around 15 minutes!</LD>
<TE>   The DSN sends commands to the spacecraft and receives images and
data back. To do this, it must know exactly where the spacecraft is
so it can point the antenna right toward it. The DSN can also track
how fast a spacecraft is going.</TE>
<TE>   Today Voyager 1 is the most distant human-made object in the
universe, and Voyager 2 is the third. (The second most distant is
Pioneer 10, launched in 1972 to visit Jupiter.) The DSN allows
scientists to learn more about the journeys of the two spacecraft and
what space is like so far away from the sun. To learn more about the
Deep Space Network, check out the Space Place at
spaceplace.nasa.gov/dsn_fact1.htm.</TE>

Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a

<AU>RUTH ANDREW ELLENSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With her sweep of dark hair and effervescent personality, Helie Lee
greets a visitor to her home with a warm embrace. As she bounds into
the kitchen to make tea, it is hard to imagine this Topanga Canyon
bohemian, casually clad in a white cotton shirt and bluejeans, is the
same woman who risked her life smuggling relatives out of North
Korea.</LD>
<LD>   The 37-year-old has chronicled that adventure in the book "In the
Absence of Sun," recently published by Harmony Books. The title
refers as much to the literal dark and cold of her journey to smuggle
her uncle and his eight family members out of the oppressive
communist regime as to the loss her grandmother endured when she fled
North Korea at the beginning of the Korean War in 1950 with only four
of her five children. Her eldest son, then 16, had gone off to fight,
his location unknown, and Lee's grandmother, Baek Hong Yong, had to
leave while she had the opportunity to ensure the safety of her other
children.</LD>
<TE>   That lost boy, Lee's uncle Lee Yong Woon, came crashing back into
Lee's life in 1991 after a 41-year search by her family to locate
him. Another uncle had tentatively located his brother in a small
village, but he couldn't confirm it was his older brother, until the
day a letter arrived from Yong Woon's daughter, Ae Ran, who wrote of
her family's desire to reconnect with their long-lost American
relatives. After 41 years of not knowing if her oldest child was dead
or alive, Lee's grandmother had been given her answer. "The next
step," said Lee, "was to reunite them, but the question was how."</TE>
<TE>   Lee's first book, 1996's "Still Life With Rice," was a
fictionalized account of her grandmother's life that included the
story of her anguished abandonment of Yong Woon. When a translation
was published in South Korea later that year, Lee was informed that
her cousins' lives were now in danger because the book was critical
of the North Korean government. "To be invisible is safer in North
Korea," said Lee. The need to get Yong Woon out became even more
pressing when her grandmother's health began declining.</TE>
<TE>   A Perilous Journey</TE>
<TE>   The rescue attempt was launched the following year through a
series of false leads, smugglers, bribery, threats and occasional
appearances by the FBI and the South Korean CIA. Yong Woon and his
family--the youngest of whom was a month old, the oldest, 62--were
soon to climb their way through the forests and mountain passes of
Vietnam and Mongolia.</TE>
<TE>   Lee's family retained the services of a guide, whom Lee never
names in her book. "It's to protect him. The work he does is
extremely dangerous. His life is already in enough danger, and I
wouldn't want to put him at risk further." Lee does say she shared a
tumultuous and vaguely romantic relationship with the man during
their ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   The passage at last brought them to the Yalu River dividing China
and North Korea, Yong Woon's family on one side, Lee and her father
60 yards away on the other. The tension of this first meeting was
heightened by the North Korean soldiers who had been bribed to let
them continue but who, nonetheless, stood looking down on them,
rifles in hand.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a terrible moment of recognition to see how frail and
gaunt [my uncle] was as he stood across the river from us,"
remembered Lee. "I could see from his physical appearance alone how
much he had been deprived of from being left behind." Yong Woon was
nearly skeletal and dressed in rags. Lee told him that his mother had
never forgotten him.</TE>
<TE>   North Korean refugees, said Lee, "are in a desperate state. They
are hiding out in absolute fear of being captured and repatriated.
When that happens, anything from execution to being put into a
concentration camp to being maimed is possible, so these people do
not want to be captured at any cost. My relatives carried rat poison
with them to commit suicide rather than be caught."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, her uncle's family successfully crossed into South Korea
and settled into lives of freedom.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, Lee said, "none of us realized what we were getting
into. We had thought it was going to take a few weeks, and it turned
out to be a seven-month odyssey. There were times we wanted to give
up, when we didn't think it was going to be possible. There were too
many things going wrong, and if we failed, the consequences were so
huge. I would just have to remember that there were nine lives
resting in our hands."</TE>
<TE>   Appreciating America</TE>
<TE>   "In the Absence of Sun" also chronicle's Lee's difficulties as an
American woman in a society in which even to have a slight
disagreement with her father would mean a loss of pride for him, and
in which she had to deal with the chauvinistic assumptions of the
guide about her intelligence and abilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to go to Korea to find out what an American I really am and
to appreciate America for everything this country has allowed me to
be," observed Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Lee said she was so overwhelmed by the journey, the book poured
out of her upon her return. "Whenever I was awake I was writing, I
never took a break. It was only when we got home and everyone was
safe that it really struck me what we had done and what was at
stake."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to her uncle, Lee and her family, including her
father, Jae Hak, mother Duk Hwa and siblings David and Julie, had
been living a comfortable existence in Los Angeles after leaving
Korea when Lee was 4. After a one-year sojourn in Canada, the family
relocated to the San Fernando Valley in 1969, and Lee went on to
attend El Camino Real High School and UCLA, earning her degree in
political science in 1986. Her grandmother joined them in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   After spending time doing various jobs, some in the entertainment
industry, including a stint as an assistant to Keenan Ivory Wayans on
"In Living Color," and managing her own cafe on Beverly Boulevard,
Lee set about discovering her family's history. As she learned of her
grandmother's dramatic past she was inspired to write "Still Life
With Rice," which became a national bestseller. She said it was in
discovering her grandmother's history for that book that she first
heard the name of her uncle, a subject that until then had been too
painful for her grandmother to talk about.</TE>
<TE>   Desire to Flee Is Strong</TE>
<TE>   But their story is not unique. About 10 million families were
separated by the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement, said Gina Lee of
the Korean consulate in Los Angeles, where the Korean community
numbers about 675,000. And the desire to flee North Korea remains
strong as North Korean refugees storm embassies in China hoping to
find asylum.</TE>
<TE>   Though some family reunifications have occurred in the last few
years, they are only for brief visits, said Gina Lee, and for 12% of
those who had applied to visit their lost relatives, time simply ran
out as they grew old and died.</TE>
<TE>   Helie Lee's grandmother, affectionately known as Halmoni, which
means "grandmother," held on through her family's ordeal long enough
to see her son again and admire his family, to see them start anew in
the south. Halmoni died at 90 on a recent Sunday morning at her home
with her younger sister holding her hand. Before she died, Lee said,
"I sat by her bed, holding her hand and said, 'It's OK, you've found
him, you can let go now. You've gotten what you wanted.' She said, 'I
can't go until I see you married to throw you a big party and help
you with your first child in gratitude for what you have done for
me.' Even in death I'm holding her to it."</TE>
<TE>   Yong Woon flew in from South Korea for his mother's funeral and
spent the night he arrived alone at his mother's home, sleeping in
her empty bed. "It is a loss for all of us," said Lee, "but for him
the time lost will never be regained. He had just found her, and now
she is gone."</TE>
<TE>   Since her trek five years ago, Lee has grown into an activist on
behalf of North Korean refugees and last week spoke before a Senate
subcommittee on immigration. She testified to the ordeal her family
endured "to give voice to all those refugees who are still in China,
to have our government open the gates here to give these people
shelter."</TE>

<DH>Burgeoning immigration is reflected in upcoming works about
the multicultural experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The great immigration that has influenced U.S. culture in so many
ways over the past two decades now is a force to reckon with in
American letters as well. The vast movement of people into the United
States from Latin America, Asia and the Mideast not only has created
whole new communities, but also refreshed the roots of ethnic groups
long resident here. One result is a bracing new literature producing
books publishers are eager to acquire and readers anxious to buy.</LD>
<LD>   One of the current season's critical hits is Gary Shteyngart's
"The Russian Debutante's Handbook," an ebullient send-up of
traditional immigrant novels. The talent of its 29-year-old,
Leningrad-born Jewish author first was recognized by another
immigrant writer, Chang-rae Lee, the Korean American author of
"Native Speaker," who also directs the creative writing program at
Hunter College.</LD>
<LD>   And last week, St. Martin's Press won a six-publisher auction
earning the right to pay $500,000 for "The Dirty Girls' Social Club,"
the first novel by journalist Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, a former Times
staff writer who is feature editor at the Albuquerque Journal.
(Valdes-Rodriguez, in her early 30s, has described herself as "half
Cuban American and half Irish/Mexican/English/Portuguese American.")</LD>
<TE>   "It's an absolutely marvelous book," said Elizabeth Beier, who
will edit the manuscript for St. Martin's. "It's utterly fresh and
the people here who read it literally could not put it down."</TE>
<TE>   Valdes-Rodriguez describes her novel as a story of "middle-class,
assimilated Latina professionals, who may or may not speak Spanish.
It is about six women friends and is set in Boston, where they all go
to Boston University. The premise is that it is the first time there
are so many Latinas in the school's communications program and they
make a pact to meet every six months for the rest of their lives. We
catch up with them 10 years after their first meetings."</TE>
<TE>   "All the chapters are written in the first person and each woman
is struggling with different issues," she said. "I tried to show the
diversity of that part of the Latino community, so there's a blond
blue-eyed Cubana Jew from Miami and a black lesbian from Colombia.
There's a Southern California girl raised to think she's Chicana. The
hard part was keeping the various voices distinct."</TE>
<TE>   St. Martin's plans to publish the novel next spring.</TE>
<TE>   A Hollywood Story</TE>
<TE>   It's a literary story with a Hollywood ending and it can be found
in the Los Angeles-based Written By, the publication of the Writers
Guild of America West. Last summer, Written By editor Richard Stayton
launched an annual fiction issue. Its theme was the Hollywood novel,
and the selections by guest editor David Freeman were as knowing as
his career as a screenwriter and novelist would suggest.</TE>
<TE>   This year's topic is mystery and crime, and guest editor Dick
Lochte--who also reviews mysteries for The Times--has served up
something of uncommon interest: an all-but-forgotten short story by
Raymond Chandler. According to Stayton, Lochte first came across the
14-page, single-spaced manuscript while working at Playboy in the
1960s. The magazine had purchased the story but never ran it.
Attached to the manuscript was a note dated Feb. 3, 1951, from
Chandler to his agent, Carl Brandt:</TE>
<TE>   "Herewith a story, 'A Couple of Writers,' with which I amused
myself quite a lot although realizing it had no commercial value
whatever--to our mutual regret, no doubt," Chandler wrote. "Reading
it over last night I thought it was a pretty fancy piece of writing
all the same. So there.... "</TE>
<TE>   Stayton, a writer and theater critic, describes the story as "two
people on the morning after a very bad night. It's told from the male
writer's point of view and it's a brutally honest portrayal of
writing and alcoholism gone far. I personally think it's about
Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman, a couple of alcoholics going at
each other while trying to write in the house they've rented out in
the sticks. It's very bleak."</TE>
<TE>   A version of the story eventually appeared in a volume of
miscellany titled "Raymond Chandler Speaking." But Written By's
editors resolved to publish it in the magazine format Chandler
intended, even though, as Stayton said, "I thought we'd have to pay
an arm and a leg for it."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Ed Victor Ltd., the London literary agency which
now represents Chandler's interests, simply asked that the magazine
donate $100 to any charity that assists writers, in the name of the
Raymond Chandler estate.</TE>
<TE>   Written By's summer fiction issue will be available on newsstands
next week.</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Nina Marie Martinez, another first-time novelist, lives in Yuba
City: "I'm currently writing a novel and working with my editor
revising another, which will be published next year. Are they ever
done? The thing about good books is that you really can't describe
them. The novel we're editing has six main characters and a volcano
set in a fictional Central California town called Lava Landing. My
agent and my editor wanted a Spanish title that's pithy and that
people who don't speak Spanish can understand, so right now it's
called 'Caramba.'</TE>
<TE>   "It has three sets of major characters. I started writing about
them and then they had friends and then their friends had friends and
then they all had families and the story was all over the place. What
holds them all together is the volcano and Mexican loteria cards,
which have not only images, but those wise sayings. They're part of
the novel's structure. I'd also like to include what you might call
artifacts--hand-written letters, the loteria cards themselves, which
represent archetypes in Mexican culture, and also paper dolls with
regional Mexican costumes since one of the characters dresses like
she is right off a Mexican calendar."</TE>

<LD>We drive through the Pasadena streets in a caravan in three cars.</LD>
<LD>   "Like a wedding," Grandma says.</LD>
<LD>   I grin. "Did I tell you that I feel like a bridesmaid?"</LD>
<TE>   "Are you sure we brought everything?" Grandma asks Grandpa.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure," Grandpa says. "I laid it all in the trunk."</TE>
<TE>   "Carefully?" Grandma asks.</TE>
<TE>   He nods. "Carefully."</TE>
<TE>   Grandma relaxes against the back of the seat. "Good."</TE>
<TE>   The minute we get to Monroe and the cars stop, a big bunch of
girls and a couple of guys surround our car. These are some of Kate's
friends. She has lots.</TE>
<TE>   The aunts and cousins pile out behind us, and there are all kinds
of introductions.</TE>
<TE>   "And these are my grandma and grandpa," Kate says, standing
between them, an arm around each. You can see how proud she is. "My
grandma is 79. Can you believe it?"</TE>
<TE>   Grandma smiles in an embarrassed way. I guess when you get that
old you're pleased to have people know your age. Especially on a day
like this.</TE>
<TE>   "And you've met my little sister, Jenny the Pest," Kate says. This
time they all groan.</TE>
<TE>   "Evil," I whisper.</TE>
<TE>   My cousin Daphne is busy making goo-goo eyes at a boy called
George. I'm ashamed Daph and I are related.</TE>
<TE>   There are two entrances to the auditorium. One has a sign that
says VISITORS and the other says GRADUATING CLASS. We walk in a group
toward the graduate entrance, and there's more hugging before the
rest of us leave.</TE>
<TE>   The big auditorium is pretty packed, but we're lucky to find a row
that's almost empty. We fill it quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Some guys and girls are handing out programs, and we search for
our name. I point a finger at the right line. "Prentiss. It's at the
bottom of page 4." It seems unreal that the time is almost here at
last. We've been waiting for this so long.</TE>
<TE>   There's an orchestra at the front, and a platform with a line of
seated adults in black gowns. I recognize Kate's principal and the
music teacher who came once to our house.</TE>
<TE>   And now I see the graduating class filing into the front rows.</TE>
<TE>   I'm excited and nervous. And I'm not even graduating.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Why is Jenny so excited and nervous?</TE>
<TE>   Eve Bunting's favorite graduation day was when her granddaughter
graduated from preschool! This story will be on The Times' Web site

<HD>'Iris' and 'West Wing' Win Humanitas Prizes</HD>
<DH>Industry* The movie and TV writing awards also go to
'Laramie Project,' Bill Moyers; fellowship created honoring 9/11
victims David and Lynn Angell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The screenplays for the movie "Iris," the HBO presentation of "The
Laramie Project" and an episode of NBC's "The West Wing" in which
President Bartlet questions his faith in God were among the winners
of 2002 Humanitas Prizes, the annual movie and TV writing awards
established by the late Father Ellwood "Bud" Kieser. The awards were
presented Tuesday at a luncheon in Universal City.</LD>
<LD>   It was also announced that a Humanitas fellowship for aspiring
television writers has been established in honor of "Frasier"
co-creator David Angell and his wife, Lynn, who were aboard American
Airlines Flight 11, the first plane to hit the World Trade Center on
Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The Humanitas Prize was begun in 1974 by Kieser as a way both to
honor and encourage movie and television writing that honestly
explores the human condition. A new prize, the Kieser Award, was
presented this year to journalist Bill Moyers.</LD>
<TE>   "Iris," about the relationship between British novelist Iris
Murdoch and her husband, John Bayley, was written by Richard Eyre and
Charles Wood and was cited for its dignified portrait of "two people
deeply in love who are surrendering their bodies to the ravages of
age."</TE>
<TE>   "Real Women Have Curves," written by George LaVoo and Josefina
Lopez, was also recognized in the Sundance Feature Film category.</TE>
<TE>   Among episodic dramas, "Two Cathedrals," the "West Wing" episode
written by series creator Aaron Sorkin, tied with an episode of "The
Practice" about a lawyer representing an insurance company who
violates attorney-client privilege by telling the parents of a
10-year-old boy that the child has an aneurysm that must be operated
on immediately. The episode was written by series creator David E.
Kelley and Lukas Reiter.</TE>
<TE>   Other television winners included the ABC miniseries "Anne Frank,"
written by Kirk Ellis; "The Laramie Project," written by Moises
Kaufman and members of the Tectonic Theater Project; and the "My Old
Lady" episode of NBC's "Scrubs," written by Matt Tarses.</TE>
<TE>   In children's categories, Anna Sandor's screenplay for the
live-action Showtime production "My Louisiana Sky" was honored along
with the Cartoon Network's animated "Balto II: Wolf Quest," written
by Dev Ross.</TE>

<HD>Cho and Her Mother of Comic Invention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As every Margaret Cho fan knows, stories about her mother are among
the highlights of her freewheeling, iconoclastic comedy routines.
"Notorious C.H.O.," which opens Friday, is a filmed version of the
show she took on the road last year. It begins with backstage
interviews with her parents and ends with a tale about her mother
falling off a camel she didn't want to ride in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes I say [to Margaret]," said Cho's mother, Young Hie Cho,
on a recent visit to Los Angeles, "I have to talk to you very often,
otherwise you'll be out of material!"</LD>
<LD>   These days they've been rendezvousing in person--last month in New
York, where Cho received the Lambda Liberty Award for her book "I'm
the One That I Want"; earlier this month in San Francisco for the
world premiere of "Notorious C.H.O."; and now here in Cho's new home,
in the sunny Glendale hills, which is still being decorated.</LD>
<TE>   The Korean American mother and daughter are sitting cozily next to
each other at the end of a long couch, two peas in a pod, except one
is in yellow and the other in white. Mrs. Cho has donned a bright
yellow top made of crinkled fabric with sensible flats, while
Margaret wears a loose-fitting white dress with little suede booties.
The comedian seems remarkably relaxed and even teddy-bearish, a
contrast to the tough, abrasive C.H.O. persona she assumes onstage.</TE>
<TE>   Her pad is a funky version of a modest Hollywood mansion--or a
kind of postmodern Tony Duquette fantasy, what with two knee-high
gilded lions flanking the outside walk and rooms painted in vivid,
mottled colors and filled with ornate Indian and Southeast
Asian-style furnishings and objets, looking mostly too new to be
antiques. "Actually I got most of this stuff around L.A.," says Cho.</TE>
<TE>   The living room, where the interview takes place, is graced with a
dancing Shiva figurine in one corner and, on the wall, two panels
depicting Kama Sutra-style copulating couples. For a moment Mrs. Cho
drops her perennial smile and casts a furtive look over to the wall.
She remarks, "Mmm, difficult to have children here."</TE>
<TE>   What is it like being the subject of Cho's routines? Mrs. Cho
claims she is used to it and swells with pride when recounting how
strangers gush when they discover she's the comedian's mother. At the
San Francisco premiere of "Notorious C.H.O.," the audience went wild
when Cho's parents were introduced.</TE>
<TE>   "I really enjoyed being there," says Mrs. Cho. "So many came for
her premiere, I feel they really love Margaret--and they really like
me too!"</TE>
<TE>   Cho's stage show ends in an anthem of inclusiveness and
self-acceptance, but while growing up, even in multiracial San
Francisco, she couldn't help but feel cheated that she wasn't
mainstream--that is, middle-class white. "We wanted to be really
American," says Cho, 33. "At the same time, we're constantly reminded
of our foreignness every time we go home--the customs, the different
food, the different life we had as opposed to the one we saw on TV or
at our friends' house."</TE>
<TE>   Did she ever wish she were white?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, all the time," Cho cheerily admits. "It was a constant
longing, and it didn't even go away till like my late teens, where I
finally let it go because I realized it wasn't gonna happen." She
laughs.</TE>
<TE>   Then her consciousness was raised. In her teens, her feeling of
racial inferiority "turned completely around and became this fierce
pride, into like being angry about it."</TE>
<TE>   Early on she learned to use it in her comedy. Cho had started
doing stand-up comedy while a student at the High School of the
Performing Arts, and by 16 she was lining up her own gigs. Soon she
dropped out of high school and went on the road to perform.
Observations on Asian identity and on her mother (originally
disguised under the name Edna) were already woven into her material.</TE>
<TE>   "When she was small I never thought she's gonna be actress or
comedian," her mother admits. "When she became teenager, we want her
to be like some kind of doctor, any kind of job she can study in
college. She was really smart, we expected her to go to Harvard or
Stanford or something like that, but she turned out different way.
I'm a very flexible person, so after a while we cannot say anything,
we're really happy."</TE>
<TE>   Was the atmosphere at home always so approving? Cho shakes her
head. After all, they were strict Asian parents, she points out.
"They didn't like it."</TE>
<TE>   There was a brief but ultimately ignominious moment when Cho did
feel accepted by Greater America--in 1994, when she landed the lead
in "All-American Girl," a groundbreaking ABC sitcom based on her own
life and family.</TE>
<TE>   Except, as detailed in her show, film and book, "I'm the One That
I Want," pretty soon the execs found her face "too full," so they put
her on a killer diet (after two weeks she was hospitalized for kidney
failure); they didn't find her Asian enough, so they hired an Asian
consultant; and they found her humor too acerbic, so asked her to
tone it down. Finally, the show was canceled--which she has referred
to as being "saved by the gong," although she slid into a
booze-fueled depression.</TE>
<TE>   Cho's routines are famously outrageous and raunchy, full of
references to sex, race and politics. She takes her digs at clueless
boyfriends and ditzy chicks; she eulogizes gay men and drag queens
whom she sees as her allies. In the current show she recounts
hilariously humiliating moments, including a visit to a sex club
replete with dominatrixes and voyeurs and a session of colonic
irrigation with a tittering clinician who somehow sticks the tube
into the wrong orifice.</TE>
<TE>   How much of her material is taken from real life and how much is
made up? Although she changes names and makes up composite
characters, she says, "it's all really based on truth."</TE>
<TE>   When she does her Mommy persona, Cho squints her eyes, drops a
corner of her mouth, presses back her neck and speaks in a sputtering
Korean accent.</TE>
<TE>   In real life her mother is neither squinty nor sputtering,
although if given half a chance the real Mrs. Cho clearly loves to
spin anecdotes.</TE>
<TE>   In "Notorious" there is a routine in which Mommy begins, "I think
everybody's a little bit ga-a-ay ... " and tells a story about
Daddy's best friend in college, a man, it turns out, who was in love
with him.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of the interview, Cho's father, Seung Hoon Cho,
comes by, and he acknowledges that he had a very close friend in
college. However, when asked if he ended up punching the guy as in
Cho's tale, he begins to laugh uncomfortably.</TE>
<TE>   Looking embarrassed, he says, "It's all in the imagination."
Sitting on the other end of the sofa, Cho's eyes bulge skeptically as
she mouths the words, "It's true, it's true...."</TE>
<TE>   Though "Notorious" doesn't delve into the dilemma of Asian
American identity as much as "I'm the One That I Want," Cho still
believes it's an important issue, and it's one she plans to address
centrally in her next show.</TE>
<TE>   "What gets me about racism nowadays is that it's very subtle," she
says. "In film, it's great there are all these stars coming from
Asia--Michelle Yeoh, Jackie Chan--but it almost reinforces the idea
of Asian foreignness. Asian Americans seem lackluster compared to
these foreigners who can run up walls and do amazing feats. So for
Asian Americans to qualify for the film screen, we're expected to
have special powers, which is unfair."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, her mother remains a strong part of her routine and
will for the foreseeable future. "To me it's the voice of my
Asianness, the part of me that remains foreign," Cho admits. "There's
a real earthiness to it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really making fun of it at all. It's more an ancient
perspective in a modern world, that's how I see it--the juxtaposition
between the immigrant mind and the very modern circumstances in which
I see myself."</TE>

<HD>Once an Altar, Now a Stage</HD>
<DH>St. Vibiana's, the defunct downtown Catholic church, is the
venue for 'Crossings,' a refreshing production of six plays of
updated Bible stories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An out-of-place object becomes an accidental piece of public art in
the parking lot of downtown's defunct St. Vibiana's Roman Catholic
Church. The cream-colored cupola that stood atop the church's bell
tower for more than 100 years now lies sideways on the pavement, as
if someone ripped the top off a wedding cake and dashed it to the
ground. Next to the cupola is the church cross, also resting on its
side.</LD>
<LD>   Both the cupola and the cross are victims of the 1994 Northridge
quake, when severe damage led to hotly debated plans to raze the
Spanish Baroque cathedral at 2nd and Main streets to make room for a
new cathedral. Instead, St. Vibiana's will be redeveloped into a
complex containing a performing arts center, hotel and restaurant--as
a new cathedral, Our Lady of the Angels, goes up nearby.</LD>
<LD>   But for now, the cracked and peeling St. Vibiana's is being put to
remarkably effective use as the home of "Crossings," a refreshing,
emotionally direct production from Cornerstone Theatre Company, using
updated Bible stories to explore the journeys of Catholic immigrants
to Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   The six plays, mixing professional actors with community members
in the Cornerstone tradition, make up for the lack of experience of
the non-pros by reverberating with the same sort of uninhibited
passion that shook L.A.'s Catholic community over the future of St.
Vibiana's.</TE>
<TE>   Written by Cornerstone ensemble members in collaboration with five
parishes of the archdiocese of Los Angeles, the production is part of
Cornerstone's 3 1/2-year Faith-Based Cycle project. Most of the
community cast members hail from the participating parishes: St.
Philomena Church, Aumonerie Catholique Francophone de Los Angeles,
Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Church, St. Frances X. Cabrini and Ascenscion
Catholic Churches, and the Arab American Community of St. Joseph
Catholic Church. The plays' content represents Cambodia, Mexico and
Arab and African nations.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Steve Kent, the peripatetic production leads audiences
from a makeshift parking-lot amphitheater with a pile of dirt as its
stage; up five flights of stairs to a rooftop which, through watery
sound effects, believably transforms into the swaying deck of Noah's
Ark; into a peaceful fountain courtyard that becomes strife-torn
Zaire; into the gorgeous abandoned sanctuary, used here to set the
scene for conflict in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   In "Crossings' " most arresting visual effect, a line of red sand
dividing the room in half stands in for the River Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, "Crossings" opened during the run of another major
site-specific experiment, an all-female "King Lear," presented by the
Center for New Theater at CalArts in the Edison Electric Building at
the Brewery Arts Complex. But whereas "Lear"--a much more high-tech
affair, complete with large-scale video projections and a riser
platform that rotates the audience to follow the actors--used its
multiple performance spaces mainly for visual and dramatic effect,
"Crossings" redefines the term "site-specific" by integrating the
literal facts of St. Vibiana's' own troubled history into the story.</TE>
<TE>   The final play of the sequence, "The Upper Room," written by
Cornerstone associate artist Bernardo Solano and based on the
Pentecost story, brings all the characters of the previous stories
together. In Solano's work, the real-life conflict between those who
would rescue the old church and those who preferred a new cathedral
in a better neighborhood becomes a handy metaphor for the breakdown
of custom and culture inherent in the immigrant experience.</TE>
<TE>   And along with his use of the local news, Solano also references
national headlines, with pointed references to the current sex abuse
scandal dogging the Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   Shishir Kurup, a member of the Cornerstone ensemble, provides an
equally irreverent presence as Isaiah--in Alison Carey's "Replenish
the Earth," which opens the evening with a reworking of the Tower of
Babel story playing off the language barriers of L.A.'s multicultural
population, then in "The Upper Room" as Izy. Kurup's Isaiah also
turns up between acts as a sort of guide-narrator, frequently
breaking the fourth wall by needling audience members about their own
religious beliefs and practices.</TE>
<TE>   The plays in between are somewhat less topical, and less
comic--but no less effective. Though these dramas (and the occasional
inside joke from Kurup) may resonate more strongly for Catholics,
immigrants or Catholic immigrants, the universality of experience
presented in "Crossings" provides a general audience with just enough
separation between church and stage.</TE>

<HD>PBS Cautiously Exercises Options on 'Wall Street'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>PBS finally unveils the revamped "Wall Street Week" this Friday,
introducing the new anchors and look that have been in the works
since founding host Louis Rukeyser decamped for CNBC in April, after
a much-publicized dispute over what was to be his diminished role led
to his firing.</LD>
<LD>   The program, which airs in Southern California at 8:30 p.m. on
KCET-TV, comes with a new partner, Fortune magazine. The hosts
stepping into the 69-year-old Rukeyser's role are Karen Gibbs, 50,
most recently a business correspondent and substitute anchor for Fox
News Channel; and Geoff Colvin, 48, editorial director for Fortune,
who also has a daily report on CBS Radio. Before Fox, Gibbs was a
CNBC anchor, and she also worked as a vice president and senior
futures strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds.</LD>
<LD>   The familiar guest and panel of experts will be back, but the set
and graphics will be new, and the theme music has been updated. The
series continues to be produced by Maryland Public Television, now in
association with Fortune, with the title "Wall Street Week With
Fortune."</LD>
<TE>   PBS said it has corporate underwriters lined up for the program
but won't announce who they are until later this week. Some sponsors
from the old show followed Rukeyser to CNBC, where he launched a
competing program, "Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street," on April 19.</TE>
<TE>   Audience savvy has changed markedly since the show was conceived
and launched with Rukeyser as host 32 years ago, Gibbs said. Back
then, "Nobody knew what the Dow was, what the Federal Reserve
interest rate was, and more people owned homes than stocks," she
noted. Today's audience, by contrast, is actively managing retirement
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was a fine line deciding what to keep and what to
change. The show "was ready for some renovation, or revitalization,"
Colvin said. "On the other hand, we don't want to shock or upset the
viewers that this program has had for some time. So we have to make
changes, but we have to make them carefully."</TE>
<TE>   Many viewers have already been upset, however, voicing their
displeasure to PBS stations for seeming to push Rukeyser out. Some
people pulled donations. In addition, Rukeyser's new CNBC program,
which also includes his previous rotating panelists, airs at the same
time as "Wall Street Week," and enough viewers have followed him
since the show was introduced to make it CNBC's highest-rated program
during the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   That said, his average 384,000 viewers on CNBC at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time (plus others who catch him at 8:30 p.m.) is far less
than the 1.74 million who tuned in to the PBS show on average this
past season before he left. Many other viewers watch him on
rebroadcasts of the CNBC show, which air on nearly 150 PBS stations
over the weekend in an unusual arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   PBS says it isn't focused on ratings, but the network has seen its
numbers drop for its Rukeyser-less show. The new program is hoping to
appeal to a wider audience with a more diverse group of panelists. In
another departure, Gibbs said, panelists will occasionally recommend
stocks to sell instead of only stocks to acquire, and "We're going to
hold them accountable" for their recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   That's partly a way to address the current trend affecting a wide
spectrum of financial television--namely, viewers aren't watching as
much because the market is down. "When the market is going nowhere,
people are less interested," Colvin said, adding, "The real
importance of having guests tell you what to sell as well as what to
buy is facing reality. Not every stock is a buy.... We're not turning
this into the bear show, but we just want to get the mix a little
more reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   "Wall Street Week With Fortune" will feature former U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin on the first episode, and Jim
Chanos--president and founder of Kynikos Associates, who saw the
Enron problems long before the rest of Wall Street--will also be a
guest. Rukeyser's guest Friday is influential Peter Lynch, vice
chairman of Fidelity Management &amp; Research Co.</TE>

<HD>Memories of a Glamorous Age</HD>
<DH>Movies* Clara Bow, the 'It Girl,' was among the top stars
of silent-era Hollywood. Now her remaining memorabilia is on the
auction block.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the Butterfield auction house in Los Angeles, a woman's voice is
heard on a cassette recording pleading with her bird, Feisty, to
talk. In her strong Brooklyn accent, she implores her pet to say
something: "Pretty baaaby. Come on, pretty baaaby"</LD>
<LD>   The woman's voice is etched with pain and heartache, and the
recording plays like a scene from Billy Wilder's "Sunset Boulevard."
But the woman on the recording is not Norma Desmond; it's Clara Bow,
the kewpie doll silent-screen siren, the epitome of the '20s flapper,
who was known to her legion of fans as the "It Girl."</LD>
<LD>   The Feisty clip, which was recorded in the mid-'50s, is one of
many rarities from Bow's estate that are being auctioned by
Butterfields Thursday in San Francisco. The collection, which
includes rare sets of still photos from her movies as well as a heavy
bronze urn that holds the ashes of her beloved cocker spaniel,
Diablo, offers insight into the troubled life and career of the
actress.</LD>
<TE>   Recently, the items were previewed at Butterfields in Los Angeles,
where David Stenn, who wrote the acclaimed Bow biography, "Clara Bow:
Runnin' Wild," acted as a tour guide through the memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   Her oldest son, former Las Vegas district attorney Rex Bell Jr.,
had kept his mother's belongings in his house since her death in
1965. "It was stuff I wouldn't throw away like some people would,"
Bell says. "When David came into our lives, that's when I showed him
all the stuff, and then he took a lot of time out and categorized the
whole works for me. So it has been sitting there ever since."</TE>
<TE>   Bow was the top box office draw at Paramount in the late '20s. She
starred in such hits as "It" and "Wings" until sex scandals, sound
and a family history of mental illness--her mother and grandmother
ended up in asylums--finished her career.</TE>
<TE>   She retired from films in 1933 at the age of 28, married western
star Rex Bell and moved to Searchlight, their 300,000-acre ranch in
Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   She returned briefly to the spotlight in 1947 to play a mystery
guest, Mrs. Hush, on the NBC radio show "Truth or Consequences."
After that stint, she suffered a mental collapse, was diagnosed as a
schizophrenic and lived in seclusion until her death at 60.</TE>
<TE>   Bell says his two grown children have taken the items they wanted
to keep and he took what he wanted. "But there is enough there to
cover all the walls, so I said it's time to get rid of it."</TE>
<TE>   He decided against donating the items to an archive like the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences because, Bell says,
"everybody will take everything if you donate it to them. Then there
is the question if they would even take care of it. It is real easy
to have their hands out to donate. I donated a lot of stuff already
of hers and Dad's, so it is time for the estate to make her money."</TE>
<TE>   Butterfield's estimates on items from the Bow estate are pricey. A
silver gelatin, hand-tinted print of Bow inscribed by the actress to
her father is estimated at $1,500 to $2,500. A collection of 94
stills from her 1930 movie, "The Wedding Night," is estimated at
$3,000 to $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Bow scrupulously organized her collection. On envelopes and backs
of photographs, she wrote notes of explanations to her sons, such as:
"Mom--as Mrs. 'Hush' of 1948" and "To my sons, Tony and George--To be
shared between you. Large photographs of Clara--during her years at
Paramount Studios 1925-1931 as their top box office star."</TE>
<TE>   Perusing the case containing most of her items, Stenn comes across
two ornate gold candlesticks.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were the candlesticks that went into the "Chinese room" of
her house, he explains. Displayed prominently in the case are several
large-format stills of Bow dressed up in a nun's habit holding rosary
beads from 1930.</TE>
<TE>   "The studio saw these and said we'll never release these because
it would be a joke," Stenn says. "So these are the only prints of
her. But at the time of these photos, she had been in enough
scandals, she decided she wanted to help her image. It was
ill-advised."</TE>
<TE>   On another shelf in the case is a beautiful large-format photo of
silent screen star Rudolph Valentino taken in 1925, a year before he
died. Bow had inscribed on the photo: "Rudolph in his greatest role
being his own charming self. I bow my head in tribute."</TE>
<TE>   The collection also features numerous scrapbooks, mostly compiled
by fans and sent to her. They're filled with photos and newspaper
clippings dating to 1923. One scrapbook features a 1940 photo of
Bow's birthplace in Brooklyn. The house has since been torn down.
Another scrapbook has a newspaper clipping that actually states the
day she left New York for Hollywood. "This is the only source that
gave the date she left New York for Hollywood," Stenn says.</TE>
<TE>   A red binder filled with rare photos and correspondence that Stenn
compiled is the real find of the collection.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like the greatest hits," says Stenn, including the
earliest known photo, circa 1925, of Gary Cooper, and a very early
picture of Bela Lugosi. There are several pictures of Bow with one of
her beaus, singer Harry Richmond--"he was a big blowhard," Stenn
says--and a portrait of her husband before his teeth were capped.</TE>
<TE>   The binder also features photos of her father, Robert Bow, who
changed his name to King Bow after his daughter married Bell. Bow
accompanied his daughter to Hollywood, where he embarrassed her in
front of friends and co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   She kept trying to set him up in business, but each venture
failed. During her hospitalization at the Institute of Living, she
claimed that he had raped her. Nevertheless, she kept him close
throughout the years, and they even lived together until his death in
the mid-'50s.</TE>
<TE>   Bell says he is surprised at his mother's enduring popularity. "If
she were alive today, I think she would be really excited about all
the people who remember her ... people who are interested in
purchasing this stuff are going to take care of it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment memorabilia auction, which includes the Clara
Bow estate, takes place Thursday at 10 a.m. at Butterfields, 220 San
Bruno Ave., San Francisco. For information call (415) 861-7500 or go

<LD>Even immersed in a much-needed vacation, my commitment to this column
is such that my reading list included "The Other Parent: The Inside
Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children," a new book by James P.
Steyer.</LD>
<LD>   "If another adult spent five or six hours a day with your kids,
regularly exposing them to sex, violence and rampantly commercial
values, you would probably forbid that person to have further contact
with them," suggests Steyer, a Stanford professor and part-time
producer who founded the nonprofit lobbying group Children Now, who
proceeds to detail how parents let the media do just that.</LD>
<LD>   Blame it perhaps on the poolside umbrella drinks that accompanied
my reading, but I didn't find the book "explosive," as the
publicist's notes claim. What ultimately struck me most, in fact, was
the title, prompting both reflection on what "the other parent"
taught me during my formative years in the 1960s and early '70s and
the realization that, for the most part, it probably helped make me a
better person instead of a more sociopathic one.</LD>
<TE>   Looking back, the original "The Twilight Zone" was one of my most
reliable tutors, variously illustrating to be careful what you wish
for, that mindless conformity is dangerous, that bigotry is wrong and
that it's wise to carry a spare set of glasses in case you suddenly
find yourself alone on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   "Bonanza" and "The Rifleman," meanwhile, helped drive home the
importance of family even in a single-parent setting, the evils of
racism and intolerance, settling disputes peacefully when possible
and knowing where your pa keeps his gun, just in case.</TE>
<TE>   The other parent repeatedly showed me that you can be friends with
someone of a different background, whether you travel the globe
together spying for the U.S. government or explore the galaxy on a
starship. I also decided it is a bad idea to break the law,
especially in Hawaii, because Steve McGarrett and his Five-O team
would always catch you.</TE>
<TE>   Reruns of "The Honeymooners" provided insight into the tenuous
nature of get-rich-quick schemes and the idea that couples who bicker
and fight can still consider each other the greatest. "All in the
Family" treated me to political discourse between laughs, and "The
Dick Van Dyke Show" offered valuable tips on handling a demanding
boss and exercising safety and caution if there is an ill-placed
ottoman in one's living room.</TE>
<TE>   From children's movies and TV programs came the message that man
should respect the forest and its denizens, that lying has
consequences and that it is painful to lose a pet--particularly an
"Old Yeller" dog that you have to shoot yourself--but that people do
and carry on.</TE>
<TE>   There were more frivolous lessons, too, among them that if some
stooge tries to poke you in the eyes, placing a hand at an angle
perpendicular to your face will thwart the attack. I discovered,
thanks to the limited-animation techniques of Hanna-Barbera and
Filmation, that it's possible to be entertained for hours by programs
in which characters move very little other than their lips. I even
learned that organized crime can be fascinating, although just as
nobody ever tried to poke me in the eyes, no one solicited me to join
the mob, either.</TE>
<TE>   As for music, I recall being told the answer is blowin' in the
wind, to jump up on the peace train, to imagine that there are no
wars and killing and that if I go to San Francisco, to look for
gentle people with flowers in their hair.</TE>
<TE>   Such recollections notwithstanding, Steyer's work shouldn't be
dismissed out of hand. He is clearly correct that children's
relationship with media merits discussion, though that debate would
greatly benefit from a more dispassionate tone than he adopts or that
is generally heard in political and grant-minded academic circles.</TE>
<TE>   The book accurately observes, for example, that media were far
less pervasive, intrusive and explicit when baby boomers were kids,
though one can argue that not all those changes are wholly negative.
Just consider the video market and cable channels that have sprung up
dedicated to children's tastes--a two-edged development, really,
creating wholesome viewing options for kids and tempting increasingly
harried parents to overuse the TV as a baby-sitter.</TE>
<TE>   Among his most salient points, Steyer focuses on how media
consolidation has left companies driven foremost by shareholder value
to act as entertainment custodians for children, who are viewed as
little more than pint-sized consumers. He also includes an
appropriate call for limiting tykes' media consumption and teaching
media literacy, enabling kids to better understand and deconstruct
the messages that bombard them.</TE>
<TE>   That said, some of his suggestions are naive or impractical, and
he contradicts himself by saying millions of parents are outraged
enough to string up purveyors of smut while simultaneously
acknowledging that apathy--or more charitably, resignation--has
allowed media excesses to mushroom.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Steyer largely spares the Clinton administration from
criticism even though the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which eased
the rules governing media titans, was passed on its watch, a
noteworthy omission given that one of the author's then-students,
Chelsea Clinton, researched the book and wrote an "afterword" for it.</TE>
<TE>   The media landscape today has undergone exponential growth in the
number of outlets available, meaning that children inhabit a world
that bears scant resemblance to the one their parents knew.</TE>
<TE>   Yet no matter how much things change, TV and media are invariably
derivative of themes that worked before, which explains why so many
vintage series and movies--from the recent successful "Scooby-Doo" to
upcoming prime-time revivals of "The Twilight Zone" and "Family
Affair"--keep being recycled.</TE>
<TE>   Come to think of it, that might help explain why many adults,
including parents, aren't necessarily galvanized by this issue.
Weaned on TV and rock 'n' roll, they harbor fond memories regarding a
media diet that their parents often hated. Moreover, for all the junk
we consumed, most of us not only survived childhood but somehow did
so without shooting up the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   And by the way, kids, though it isn't quite the same as our
parents' tales about trudging 10 miles through snow to get to school,
we did it without Nickelodeon.</TE>

<LD>   PBS President: On Second Thought ...</LD>
<LD>   Pat Mitchell tried to bolster morale among her PBS troops as they
held their annual meeting in San Francisco this week. Downplaying the
significance of the network's flagging ratings, she tried to reframe
an earlier comment she made about the significance of those numbers.</LD>
<TE>   "We are dangerously close in our overall prime-time number to
falling below the relevance quotient," the PBS president told public
TV programmers in May. "And if that happens, we will surely fall
below any arguable need for government support, not to mention
corporate or individual support. There is a level beyond which we
cannot go and still claim to be a universal service."</TE>
<TE>   Upon reflection, Mitchell now says, PBS' content and community
contribution are far more important than its Nielsen performance. "I
fear that ratings have become the whole ballgame for far too many
inside our system," she said. "And I want to take responsibility for
having played a part in that."</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't prevented PBS from shuffling its lineup in an effort
to maximize audience, however. "Masterpiece Theatre," moved from its
traditional Sunday night slot last fall, will return at the start of
the new season. Why? Because "American Experience," which alternated
with "American Masters" in the Sunday slot, was being clobbered by
HBO original fare such as "Six Feet Under" and "Sex and the City."</TE>
<TE>   "There is an audience available on Sunday night of older women and
what show do we have that they love? 'Masterpiece Theatre,' " said
Coby Atlas, PBS' co-chief program executive. "We tried to do
something--and we were smart enough to know when it didn't work."</TE>
<TE>   Chung's CNN Debut: Better but Not Best</TE>
<TE>   Connie Chung's new CNN show drew an average 858,000 curious
viewers to its Monday debut, according to Nielsen Media Research
figures--a 32% improvement over the numbers for the 5 p.m. time
period in June.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, her Fox News Channel competition, Bill O'Reilly,
doesn't have much to worry about: His show drew 2.15 million viewers
Monday, up 21% over his June figures.</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   Florida Tally Targeted by Documentary</TE>
<TE>   Documentary filmmakers Joan Sekler and Richard Perez were
conducting a seat-of-the-pants operation: flying to Florida to shoot
footage about the state's infamous 2000 presidential election, using
frequent-flier miles donated by friends and colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   In March of last year, they asked filmmaker Robert Greenwald
("Steal This Movie") for support from his newly created, nonprofit
Public Interest Pictures. He's now executive producer of the hourlong
"Unprecedented: The 2000 Election," co-directed by Sekler and Perez.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than focusing on talking heads that dominated the airwaves
at the time, the movie highlights those on the front lines--from the
African Americans who were turned away from the polling booths for
assorted reasons (for example, their names incorrectly appeared on a
felons' list) to an Al Gore supporter who mistakenly voted for Pat
Buchanan on the state's controversial "butterfly" ballot. In one
memorable scene, the filmmakers freeze-frame a "protest" against the
ballot recount, identifying participants as staff members of
Republican elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   "This story has everything--drama, personalities and a story
that's important to tell: the way both sides handled things, not from
the vantage point of the 'general good,' but from a perspective of
narrow self-interest," Greenwald says. "Though we never found a
smoking gun, the patterns were pretty damning. In the end, the
Republicans just played the better game. They had a plan of victory,
while the Democrats played defense."</TE>
<TE>   Finishing touches are being put on the film, which Greenwald hopes
to screen at film festivals and air at election time. Sales to cable,
home video and the foreign market are planned. Foreign? "For better
or worse, the U.S. is still the 'big boy,' " he explains. "People are
riveted by what went on."</TE>
<TE>   Kubrick's Obsession: A Napoleon Film</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Kubrick, the legendary director who died in March 1999,
made his name with films such as "A Clockwork Orange" and "2001." But
a new book, written by Jan Harlan, focuses on a project that didn't
make it to the screen.</TE>
<TE>   "Stanley Kubrick's Napoleon--His Greatest Film Never Made"
recounts the director's obsession with the French dictator: the
18,000 books and 7,000 location photographs he accumulated over the
course of 30 years. The appeal?</TE>
<TE>   "Although Kubrick films are very different in form, there is a
common denominator--the human folly and vanity built into our species
that appears to be our downfall," said Harlan, Kubrick's executive
producer, who also filmed the documentary "Stanley Kubrick: A Life in
Pictures."</TE>
<TE>   Harlan is writing the book with his sister, Christiane, Kubrick's
widow. Their work, containing the film's script and details of the
location scouting in Romania, France and Britain in the 1970s, is
expected to come out next year.</TE>

<HD>Tell Hagar, Roth: The Times They Are A-Changin'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One fan at the Sammy Hagar-David Lee Roth concert Monday at the
Universal Amphitheatre sported a T-shirt that summed up the capacity
crowd's attitude: "Who the ... is Eddie Van Halen?"</LD>
<LD>   Of course, most of the audience knew that Van Halen is the
guitarist whose inventive harmonics, two-handed tapping, whammy-bar
flash, etc. made his namesake group the hard-rock band of the late
'70s and '80s.</LD>
<LD>   But on Monday, all that was left of those glory days were the hot
chicks, high kicks and familiar licks associated with each erstwhile
frontman's Van Halen tenure.</LD>
<TE>   There wasn't any interaction, let alone a sign of rivalry, between
original vocalist Roth and Hagar, who replaced him in the mid-'80s.</TE>
<TE>   Yet each singer offered a slightly musty variation on the rock 'n'
roll party-animal theme that did nothing to bolster whatever legacy
the band has.</TE>
<TE>   Both 90-minute sets went like clockwork, in that neither was very
spontaneous. But Hagar proved marginally more engaging, partly
because he has amiable, nimble-fingered Van Halen bassist Mike
Anthony in his band.</TE>
<TE>   Hagar's hard-drinking, bikini-girl-appreciating (but sensitive!),
regular-guy approach wasn't much more appealing than Roth's demented,
Vegas-y mugging, and his performance often felt like a giant
commercial for his Mexican beach bar and tequila brand.</TE>
<TE>   But Hagar did genuinely enjoy himself while enthusiastically
running through "Dreams," "Finish What Ya Started" and the
anachronistic solo hit "I Can't Drive 55."</TE>
<TE>   Though distinctive in its time, Eddie Van Halen's sound nowadays
can be mimicked by any wannabe as credibly as Roth's guitarist did
while blustering through "Runnin' With the Devil," "Jump," "Panama"
and myriad other VH classics.</TE>
<TE>   Though never that technically gifted, Diamond Dave was in pretty
bad voice, and his comedic talents were subdued at best.</TE>
<TE>   And he really should rethink the bleached long hair and
chest-baring spandex outfit.</TE>
<TE>   He's in decent shape at 47, but the look only underscored visually
how ungracefully this music has aged.</TE>

<HD>Dreaming of Africa</HD>
<DH>Artifacts from the Niger Delta make for an enthralling
exhibition at the UCLA Fowler Museum</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Countless rivers and tributaries snake across the Niger Delta's
swampy terrain, making travel within its 20,000 square miles of West
African rain forest difficult. In 1906, a century after the British
had outlawed the slave trade in what is now Nigeria and replaced it
with the more lucrative business of palm oil exportation, Maj. A.G.
Leonard wrote: "The country may be described as one in which Nature
is at her worst. From the slime and ooze of the soil up to the
devitalizing heat and humidity of the atmosphere, it leaves its mark
on the people in an enervating and demoralizing influence."</LD>
<LD>   An enthralling exhibition at UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cultural
History demonstrates that Leonard was half-right: Geography and
climate have profoundly affected the people of the Niger Delta, but
they hardly have sapped their vitality or dampened their creativity.</LD>
<LD>   Bringing together more than 125 statues, masks, headdresses,
puppets and paddles, "Ways of the Rivers: Arts and Environment of the
Niger Delta" nearly goes overboard to make the opposite point: This
rugged region is home to a thriving variety of cultures, each of
which has produced a panoply of fascinating objects.</LD>
<TE>   The exhibition's entry is flanked by a shark, a crocodile and a
sawfish on the left and three fantastic beasts on the right. Ranging
from 4 to 5 feet long, the stylized sea creatures on the left are
actually carved wood headdresses that have been painted and adorned
with circular mirrors for eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the delta, the headdresses are worn in elaborate
masquerades. These festivals cement social bonds by telling stories
and bringing luck--not to mention loads of fun--to their communities.
Most villagers associate the rivers and lagoons around their homes
with wealth, fertility and trade, which their spirited performances
celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the figures on the right represent mythical forest
creatures. The small ones are posts that once guarded meetinghouse
entrances. The most impressive one is among the largest wood
sculptures from sub-Saharan Africa, a 7-foot-tall male whose
eight-faced head is surmounted by an animal that resembles a
thick-legged lemur.</TE>
<TE>   The figure's two-tone paint job, bared teeth and raised fists
identify him as a bush spirit from an Ijo shrine. The most populous
group in the delta, the Ijo regard the forest as a perilous place.
Figures like this one are believed to protect villages from enemies,
disease, dangerous animals and hostile spirits.</TE>
<TE>   Blocking the path between the water and forest creatures is a
group of vitrines that display 11 small sculptures made of copper,
brass and bronze. They're among the show's most mysterious works.</TE>
<TE>   These vessels, bells, plaques and totems depict chameleons,
mudfish, elephants and hippopotamuses. Cast in the shape of a
leopard's skull, one finely wrought example includes delicate
decorative flourishes. A boldly stylized face shows the influence of
Benin bronze work and Yoruba artistry, attesting to trade with inland
regions.</TE>
<TE>   An indescribable animal, which can be made to stand on its four
stubby legs or to tip back to balance on its fat tail, is as blunt as
a fireplug and infinitely more puzzling. It makes modern cartoon
characters look over-designed and uninspired.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these objects were taken from river spirit shrines. But
experts don't know their ultimate origins or exactly how old they
are. It's likely that one was made in Manchester, England, for trade
in Nigeria. The seams where the two halves of this conical gong were
joined reveal that it's a factory copy of a more carefully crafted
original.</TE>
<TE>   The entryway objects are just the tip of the iceberg. Four larger
galleries are jampacked with artifacts more colorful, vibrant and
imaginative than these.</TE>
<TE>   The next one features ivri, carved wood figures that fuse human
bodies, fierce creatures and abstract forms. Among the most
captivating is a slender warrior whose crotch and buttocks have
become a ferocious fish, which bares its teeth in the same way the
man does. Other figures ride beasts that resemble the offspring of
modern tanks and ancient hellhounds. Nearly all have open maws.
Compared to many, Picasso's "Guernica" looks one-dimensional.</TE>
<TE>   Atop the heads of several figures are smaller versions of
themselves. They are spirit doubles, which bring fearlessness and
wisdom to their owners. Ijo, Isoko and Urhobo men and women use their
personal ivri to keep their assertiveness in check. War leaders,
however, use larger models to increase their aggressiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Pythons and crocodiles climb 6-foot-tall meetinghouse posts in the
next gallery, which includes several multi-headed bush spirit figures
that are more eccentric than the one in the entryway. The highlight
of the room is a display of eight Urhobo shrine figures, which look
as if they have just come together for an afternoon chat.</TE>
<TE>   Between 2 and 5 feet tall, these simply carved sculptures are
extraordinarily animated. Men and women stand alongside one another,
all naked except for necklaces, bracelets, anklets, top hats, coral
crowns and even more ornate headgear. All have been painted, and
although their colors have faded, they still form a rainbow of
sensuous tints and attractive contrasts. Originally, these figures
occupied their own shrines and represented nature and ancestral
spirits. Grouped together, each one's highly stylized features
soften, making them seem more approachable and human.</TE>
<TE>   The fabulous masks and spectacular headdresses in the final two
galleries steal the show. Like the shark, crocodile and sawfish in
the entry, all were used in pantomimes and performances that evoke
spirits, tell morality tales and pass legends from one generation to
the next. Diverse in style, shape and subject, they are at once
sophisticated and bold, playful and awesome.</TE>
<TE>   Many resemble canoes carved in the shape of animals. In one made
by the Ijebu-Yoruba, a tricolor umbrella emerges from the back of an
abstract crocodile, providing shade for a bird, snake and lizard. A
less polished but no less potent example combines the silhouette of a
fish with three feeding ducks, six mirrors and a mask that gazes
skyward.</TE>
<TE>   Others look like abstract sleds whose strutted frameworks form
decorative patterns and support faces that also gaze toward the
heavens. One of the most realistic depicts a pangolin, a scaly
anteater that resembles a reptile but climbs trees and gives birth
like a mammal. The Egbukere Ekpeye value this animal because it
defies categorization. Likewise, crocodiles are believed to
facilitate communication between the human and spirit worlds because
they move freely on land and in water.</TE>
<TE>   The tusks and horns of forest animals are incorporated in a pair
of striped masks whose spiked, swirling forms make Medusa look like
Sleeping Beauty. In contrast, eight elegant Ogoni masks focus on more
mundane affairs. One depicts a beautiful young woman with a hairstyle
that shows she's ready for marriage. Another portrays a man who is a
member of a prestigious society. A third makes fun of foreigners.
Wearing a pith helmet and squinting in the bright sunshine, this poor
man has a complexion that suggests he's ill.</TE>
<TE>   Also impressive are a dozen puppets used in theatrical
performances. Although they serve the same purposes as the
headdresses, their small size makes them seem more playful, not quite
like dolls but still whimsical. An example depicts a young Ibibio
girl in her ready-to-marry finery: a belt of beads, body paint and a
terrifically coifed Mohawk.</TE>
<TE>   This unprecedented exhibition was organized by Martha Anderson,
professor of art history at Alfred University, and Phillip M. Peek,
professor of anthropology at Drew University. Not to be missed, it's
filled with enough excitement to merit a return visit--or two.</TE>

<HD>LaBute Puts His Own Spin on the World</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first question cut into the soft early-evening breeze--and right
to the chase. "Do you think there are people who are really as evil
as your characters?" a woman asked writer-director Neil LaBute.</LD>
<LD>   She was among nearly 100 aspiring filmmakers, writers and fans who
came for a "poolside chat" in the shaded courtyard of Hollywood's
Chateau Marmont on Monday, hoping for insights into the dark,
original and morally twisted work of LaBute ("In the Company of Men,"
"Your Friends and Neighbors.")</LD>
<LD>   No doubt, answered LaBute, a darling of independent films and
clearly a role model for some in the audience who admired the
un-Hollywood way he pushes and sometimes crosses the line of what's
acceptable in film. In 1997's "The Company of Men," two businessmen,
one slick and ruthless, the other mousy and confused, woo a deaf
secretary only in order to drop her later and hurt her feelings. In
his current play, "The Distance From Here," being staged in London, a
character throws an infant in a gym bag into a zoo's penguin pool.</LD>
<TE>   But in the end, LaBute said, "I'm not making documentaries. I'm
making entertainment. I'm more interested in complex, interesting
people, no matter whether they're good or bad." Many of his
characters would appear on the surface to have positive aspects, he
said, but that is deceiving. "They're driven, purposeful, go after
whatever it is they want. Good or bad, they do it with drive and
energy. Usually, someone is left in their wake."</TE>
<TE>   Along with filmmaker Lisa Cholodenko ("High Art" and "Laurel
Canyon") LaBute was being interviewed by critic Elvis Mitchell in a
new feature of the Los Angeles Film Festival. The three sat on
director's stools with microphones, facing rows of chairs and
photographer's strobes which taken altogether pretty much obscured
the courtyard's small oval poolside as well as the potential chat.
The audience had many questions for Cholodenko as well, but appeared
to be more familiar with LaBute's larger body of work.</TE>
<TE>   As in his films and plays, LaBute doesn't try to put an optimistic
spin on the world. Americans, he said, are a "profoundly hungry
bunch. Wanting to come in first. Wanting to be best. They have
me-based ethic." After 9/11, he said some people did unite, but many
others were privately driven to concentrate on their personal
protection.</TE>
<TE>   LaBute, a genial teddy bear dressed in glasses and a sweatshirt,
talked confidently of his artistic process, a meandering exploration
that, contrary to scriptwriting lore, doesn't necessarily have the
first plot twist on page 20. Often, he said, "I'll write 30 pages and
go, 'Boy, this is worse than I thought,' and start over. But I like
to work and don't mind that." LaBute, 39, was born in the Midwest,
raised in the Pacific Northwest and attended Brigham Young University
as a theater major. After accepting a scholarship to London's Royal
Court Theater, he taught English in Indiana, where he started
writing. He said his first experience with filmmaking ("In the
Company of Men") was atypical. "I didn't run the gamut of trying to
get agents to get people to look at the script. I said I'll make it
myself. I had seen a lot of models through the Sundance system ...</TE>
<TE>   "If I'd known how much it cost to actually get a film on the
screen, I probably wouldn't have started. Luckily, I shot it and got
a rough cut before I realized what it would take to show the thing in
a theater."</TE>
<TE>   LaBute admitted he has a "strange relationship" with the audience.
"I like to provoke them. To think, be angry, be happy. Whatever. I
don't like too much complacency."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, he said he's always searching for things an audience
won't expect--ending a scene, for instance, just before or else long
after most people feel it should end. In films, he said, he likes to
force the audience to look at things they'd rather not see. "I love
long takes in a very uncomfortable scene where an audience will tend
to want to look away, but you give them nothing else to do. They can
leave the auditorium, but they have to confront the piece as you
devised it."</TE>
<TE>   He said he particularly likes to cast attractive actors in less
than admirable roles. "That's a strange juxtaposition for an
audience," he said, "watching people who they would, in life, be
attracted to, be a friend with, or want to date or stand next to at
graduation. And then to have them turn on them every so often and
say, 'There's no need to trust me just because I'm good-looking.' And
yet, usually in life, and often in the movies, we do anyway, just
because they have those qualities we wish we had ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   LaBute, who also directed "Nurse Betty" and "Possession" starring
Gwyneth Paltrow, which opens later this summer, said he enjoys
adapting someone else's novel or working with someone else's
screenplay. He doesn't mind that he isn't directing his current play,
"The Distance From Here." "I found it freeing to see what somebody
else would do with it," he said. "I just like the work," he said. "I
have had so many jobs that are horrible. This is good, clean work."</TE>

<HD>Forceful 'Lift' Has Stolen Moments</HD>

<LD>Kerry Washington knows all about stealing. For her role in "Lift,"
she had to learn how to shoplift. So it's only natural that she walks
away with nearly every scene in the independent film, which drew
acclaim at the 2001 Sundance festival and premieres tonight at 8:30
on Showtime.</LD>
<LD>   Co-written and -directed by DeMane Davis and Khari Streeter,
"Lift" presents a cautionary tale about a young black woman who tries
to fill the voids in her life with a flair for fashion and for crime.
In her day job, the impeccably dressed Niecy (Washington) shows
talent for designing displays at an upscale department store. But
it's also clear that her employee discount doesn't compare with the
five-finger discount at which she's so skilled.</LD>
<LD>   In stark contrast to the artless thugs who populate her Boston
neighborhood, Niecy is a veritable Botticelli of the "boost"--a term
for shoplifting used in the film, which shows her waltzing through
chichi stores to the strains of "The Blue Danube" and other classical
music while perpetrating credit card fraud or stuffing items under
her girdle.</LD>
<TE>   The stolen clothing supplements her income nicely; more important,
it brings her popularity among her acquaintances and varying degrees
of approval from her icy mother (Lonette McKee), Niecy's most
demanding customer. But Niecy's striving for acceptance leads her to
take on riskier heists.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, one of those goes awry, unleashing consequences made
worse by the fact that she has learned she is pregnant.
Unfortunately, this is also where the film stumbles slightly from its
gripping realism and where it delves a bit too melodramatically into
a tale of abuse of three generations.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these rough spots, "Lift" proves to be compelling
viewing--if for no other reason than the efforts of a strong cast led
by Washington, whom many are predicting to be on the verge of major
stardom.</TE>
<TE>   One note: Basic cable subscribers without Showtime needn't resort
to illegal activity to eventually watch "Lift." BET plans to show it,
possibly next year.</TE>

<LD>Send in the summer replacements, as the major networks labor to keep
the lights on with inexpensive, unscripted series concepts that
enjoyed varying degrees of success last week while a rerun of CBS'
"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" topped the standings, based on
viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, unscripted programs such as Fox's "American Idol" and
NBC's "Dog Eat Dog" and "Law &amp; Order" spinoff "Crime &amp; Punishment"
helped stem the tide flowing to competing options. Overall viewing of
the major networks did dip 5% compared to the corresponding week in
2001, but that was largely due to ABC, which, continuing its
in-season slide, fell 30% versus year-ago levels.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, the networks have seen their collective share of audience
slip to 35% of homes using TV during prime time and well below that
on weekends, as viewers see reruns of favorite series as an
invitation to explore other channels.</LD>
<TE>   CBS generally fares somewhat better with repeats thanks to its
older audience profile, which explains why the network could finish
first last week in overall viewing but third among adults age 18 to
49. In addition to "CSI," viewers came on down for "Everybody Loves
Raymond," "48 Hours" and a prime-time version of "The Price is
Right."</TE>

<TE>   National Nielsen Viewership</TE>
<TE>   Here are the rankings for national prime-time network television
last week (June 17-23) as compiled by Nielsen Media Research. They
are based on the average number of people who watched a program from
start to finish. Nielsen estimates there are 269 million potential
viewers in the U.S. age 2 and older. Viewership is listed in
millions.</TE>

<HD>Chilling at the Hollywood Bowl: How to Party With an Ice
Chest</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the true joys of summer in the Southland is a trip to the
Hollywood Bowl. Whether you dine in box seats with tables or on a
blanket spread alongside a path, dinner is an important part of the
evening. The Bowl's season begins Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Of course you can bring takeout food, but preparing your own meal
makes the night more special. You needn't limit yourself to
sandwiches and bags of chips, either; it's not unusual to see
Bowl-goers unpacking full meals, complete with silverware and dishes,
from coolers or hampers.</LD>
<LD>   This menu is one you can easily prepare in half an hour. The
beauty of it is that the soup, salad and dessert all chill
nicely--tucked in an ice chest--as you travel to the Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   The cucumber soup is light yet creamy, a puree of creme fraiche,
chicken broth, cucumbers and herbs. It's refreshing and does not
compete with the delicate flavors of the crab salad. If your cooler
is large enough, pack along some mugs for serving the soup.</TE>
<TE>   Regular Bowl fans know that nothing's too difficult for serving
among the seats--cakes are passed on platters, champagne is uncorked,
hot coffee is poured. So if you can, serve the salad nestled in a bed
of whole butter lettuce leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Take along a small serving plate and a spoon for passing. And
don't forget some fresh potato rolls and a little basket of sweet
French butter--for a bit of style.</TE>
<TE>   With this menu, the people next to you will be eyeing your
dessert. Though peaches and raspberries in Chambord sound
sophisticated, the dish is easy to make.</TE>
<TE>   What to drink? This is a picnic that is cool and refreshing; a
crisp Sauvignon Blanc or a bottle of Champagne might be the perfect
accompaniment to a perfect evening.</TE>
<TE>   Look for Japanese cucumbers at Asian markets and well-stocked
supermarkets. Creme fraiche can be found in the dairy case of
well-stocked supermarkets and gourmet markets.</TE>

<HD>One Nice, Refreshing Salad That Happens to Be a Potato
Salad</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE LEVY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rather than make heavy potato salads laden with mayo, Mediterranean
cooks like their potato salads to be refreshing. A friend introduced
me to an Italian rendition of fingerling potatoes flavored only with
extra-virgin olive oil, Italian parsley, salt and pepper.</LD>
<LD>   Many cooks will add lemon juice, garlic and onions--red, white or
green--and throw in herbs by the handful. Greeks find oregano a good
potato partner, while Lebanese and Egyptian cooks like mint.</LD>
<LD>   When making potato salad, remember three potato precepts: Cook
potatoes carefully, season while warm (so they absorb flavors most
readily), and handle gently once cooked. Simmer or steam the spuds in
their skins to keep in more flavor.</LD>
<TE>   Besides baby potatoes, you can also get good results with larger
white- or red-skinned boiling potatoes or the yellow-fleshed Yukon
Gold variety. Avoid russets or baking potatoes, as they tend to fall
apart.</TE>
<TE>   If you peel the potatoes, do it quickly so they won't get cold.
Then moisten them with a portion of the dressing. If you want to
embellish them, add pungent olives, capers, chopped anchovies or dill
pickles to give the potatoes punch. Lightly cooked green beans,
grilled red peppers or diced tomatoes impart a colorful, summery
accent. Fold in the remaining dressing and any extra ingredients
gently; don't mash the potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Potato salad does not benefit from prolonged chilling because cold
dressing can congeal and make the potatoes seem dry. A
mayonnaise-free Mediterranean dressing allows you to serve the salad
at room temperature.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eastern Mediterranean Potato Salad</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 10
minutes * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   Most herbs match well with potatoes. Try tarragon, chives,
cilantro or basil. Vary the dressing with garlic oil or herb-scented
oil instead of plain oil and with tarragon or balsamic vinegar
instead of lemon juice. Use the proportions of oil and lemon
juice/vinegar to your taste. Many people in the Middle East go for
equal amounts, while Provencal chefs often opt for three times as
much oil as vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   If your family insists on mayonnaise, marinate the potatoes in a
simple French fashion with dry white wine, salt and pepper. Toss the
cooled potatoes with the parsley, olives, capers and 3/4 to 1  1/4
cups mayonnaise, either regular or low-fat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds boiling potatoes, scrubbed but not peeled</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   2 to 3 tablespoons strained lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   Cayenne pepper, optional</TE>
<TE>   3 to 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup finely chopped red onion or sweet onion, such as Vidalia</TE>
<TE>   4 plum tomatoes, optional</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup chopped Italian parsley</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons capers, drained, optional</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup flavorful olives, such as Kalamata, pitted and cut in
half, optional</TE>
<TE>   Cut any large potatoes in half to speed up the cooking. Place the
potatoes in a large saucepan, cover them with water by about 1/2 inch
and add salt to taste. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer over
medium-low heat until a knife can pierce the center of the largest
potato easily and the potato falls from the knife when lifted, about
25 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile prepare the dressing. Whisk 2 tablespoons of lemon juice
with a pinch of salt, pepper and cayenne pepper to taste in a small
bowl. Add 3 tablespoons of olive oil and whisk again.</TE>
<TE>   Drain the potatoes in a colander, rinse them briefly and leave
just until cool enough to handle. Peel them if you like, and cut them
in 1-inch dice.</TE>
<TE>   Place them in a large bowl and add the onion, 3 tablespoons of
dressing and a sprinkling of salt and pepper. With a rubber spatula,
fold together gently but thoroughly. Let the potatoes cool to room
temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Dice the tomatoes (to add them to the salad), or cut them in thick
wedges to use as garnish. Whisk the remaining dressing, pour it over
the potatoes and fold it in. Add the parsley, capers, half the olives
and the diced tomatoes to the potatoes and fold together lightly.
Taste, adjust seasoning, and add more lemon juice and olive oil if
needed. Garnish with the remaining olives and with the tomatoes, if
you've cut them in wedges. Serve at room temperature.</TE>

<HD>Gorp Your Broomstick and Pebbles</HD>

<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was just too good to be true: Gorp, the basic trail mix of nuts
and dried fruit that many of us have grown up on, does not get its
name from "good old raisins and peanuts." Almost certainly it comes
from "gawp," another form of "gape," meaning to open your mouth wide.
As long ago as 1913 "to gorp" already meant "to eat noisily or
greedily."</LD>
<LD>   In fact, it's only recently that slang terms were ever coined from
the initial letters of some phrase, the way "yuppie" was coined from
"young urban professional," and it's still not very common. Slang
usually comes from exaggeration or wry humor--for instance, from the
idea of hungry hikers "gorping" their trail mix.</LD>
<LD>   Want more proof? Here are some examples of old-time lunch counter
slang. Study and learn.</LD>
<TE>   * Baldheaded row (booths in a restaurant)</TE>
<TE>   * Broomstick and pebbles (franks and beans)</TE>
<TE>   * Pitch till you win (an all-you-can-eat restaurant)</TE>
<TE>   * Muffin fight (tea party)</TE>

<HD>A Kitchen Garden of Your Own</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before you cut down the juniper bushes and rip out the oleanders,
remember: First work around them. Start small with a discreet corner
of lawn. If it doesn't look quite like kitchen gardens do in the
magazines, you will not be the sudden blight on the landscape.</LD>
<LD>   Herbs: Rosalind Creasy recommends beginners start with
Mediterranean herbs: rosemary, oregano, fennel; sweet marjoram,
chives and savory; winter savory in a dedicated patch. "They're
almost bulletproof; as long as you water them," she says. "Cut them
back once a year to keep them harvesting."</LD>
<LD>   Cucumber, squash and melons: These require a well-prepared bed
with good drainage, and a prodigious appetite. They are a bit rangy,
and benefit from trellising (or they will romp down a hillside).
Their flowering produces so many fruits that Creasy recommends "birth
control" by pinching off zucchini blossoms and tossing them into
omelets.</LD>
<TE>   Tomatoes and annuals: It is the fashion to romanticize "heirloom"
varieties, and they can produce very delicious fruit. But one reason
modern hybrids usurped them was disease resistance. There are
varieties of tomatoes suited to planters or window boxes, where the
vines can spill over the sides.</TE>
<TE>   Do not plant them near woody shrubs and trees. Their water
requirements are different and they may introduce disease, such as
wilt. Put them in a bed with other annuals, such as nasturtiums,
zinnias, marigolds, fennel, kale, peppers and lettuce. Or try mixing
them with artichokes. Do not worry about nonedible flowers, such as
poppies, as fill. These attract pollinators and beneficial insects
that control whitefly.</TE>
<TE>   Arranging the plants: Put the tall ones (say artichoke, ranging
chard or peppers) at the back, then lower lettuces and tumbling
nasturtium in the front.</TE>
<TE>   Citrus: No fruit is more Californian than citrus. Late winter,
early spring, the trees will be so fragrant they will induce what
the poet Lorca once referred to as a "lyrical headache." Meyer
lemons, Bearss Limes and Valencia oranges all grow well in Southern
California. Keep in mind that these trees can be espaliered against
sunny walls. Rather than cut down a flopping lemon tree, Creasy put
an arbor under hers.</TE>
<TE>   Other fruit trees: Plums and apricots grow well in Southern
Californian heat. It is too warm for most apples and cherries, but
there are "low chill" trees, such as Anna apples, now available.
Olives do beautifully, but bear fruit every other year. Avocados love
it here, but demand water; you need two trees for pollination. Hass
and Fuerte are a good pairing; use fallen leaves for mulch.</TE>
<TE>   Exotic fruits and bushes: For pomegranates, Kaffir limes, caper
berry bushes, allspice hedges and more, there is Papaya Tree Nursery,
12422 El Oro Way, Granada Hills; (818) 363-3680.</TE>
<TE>   Recommended reading: "The Complete Book of Edible Landscaping," by
Rosalind Creasy (Sierra Club, $25), is widely considered the best
place to start.</TE>

<HD>A COOK'S FRONTYARD</HD>
<DH>Long hidden in the back, fruit and vegetable gardens are
now on display all over the Southland</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>For most of us, fruits and vegetables come from supermarkets. For
Rosalind Creasy and a devoted band of followers in Los Angeles, the
produce department starts at the sidewalk. Sorrel, tomatoes, peppers,
savory and artichokes overlook the front of Creasy's Bay Area ranch
house. Proceeding up the walk to her front door is like entering an
oddly flowery green grocery, redolent of damp earth and roses. On
either side of the walk, interspersed with lobelia and roses,
abutilons and fuchsia, there are caraway plants, Yukon gold potatoes,
escarole lettuce, blueberries, loganberries, eggplant.</LD>
<LD>   How many edible plants you spot depends on how much time you have.
There will be 60 or so growing at any one time in the 40-by-80-foot
frontyard. But once it was like most suburban yards--driveway, lawn
and ornamental shrubs.</LD>
<LD>   When Creasy ripped out her driveway and put in artichokes and
herbs about 25 years ago, it got a reaction. Vegetable gardening in
the frontyard, she says, was "the equivalent of letting the weeds
go--I was considered a nut case."</LD>
<TE>   She kept at it until her frontyard was a sumptuous cottage garden
that not only fed her, but fed her well. Presently, amid the artful
profusion out front, she has at least 20 sorts of herbs, three types
of watermelon, 10 kinds of peppers, five of tomatoes, four of
cucumbers, three of squash and three of beans. Except now, this brick
front walk crowded by flowers and food isn't a curiosity, but a
California landmark.</TE>
<TE>   Creasy is the author of more than a dozen books on kitchen
gardening, and a proud advocate of food out front. Here in Los
Angeles, Creasy's acolytes are switching from ornamental to edible
plants in some of the swankiest gardens in Pasadena. Grapes grow in
the Arroyo, pumpkins crawl in San Marino.</TE>
<TE>   Master gardeners trained by the University of California
Cooperative Extension Common Ground Garden Program are converting
frontyards around Los Angeles to orchards and herb gardens; a San
Fernando Valley nursery is promoting the idea of hedges made of
allspice bushes and, for ornamentals, caper berry shrubbery.</TE>
<TE>   Although it would be premature to write the obituary for the lawn,
thanks to Creasy and her acolytes, edible landscaping in the
frontyard is now a mark of good taste.</TE>
<TE>   And, OK, a certain eccentricity.</TE>
<TE>   We were not always so shy about food near the front porch. Garden
writer and radio broadcaster Andy Wasowski, author of the new book
"Landcaping Revolution," takes the standardization of the American
front garden to mown grass back to the 1870s and Cincinnati landscape
architect Frank J. Scott. "Scott decreed a 'smooth, closely shaven
surface of grass is by far the most essential element of beauty on
the grounds of the suburban home,' " says Wasowski. "Lawns became
synonymous with wealth and respectability."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, growing food came to connote need, even rank poverty.
Certainly, lawn was the norm when Creasy decided on a second career
in landscaping. This Los Altos mother of two was in her 30s and had
an education degree when in 1979 she enrolled at Foothill College in
Los Altos Hills for a horticultural degree. The adult student had the
courage to challenge the prevailing Scott norm. "When they told me I
couldn't do edible landscaping, I said, 'Phooey on you!' " she
recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after graduating, she published "The Complete Book of
Edible Landscaping" through the Sierra Club. It addressed everything
from garden design to soil conditioning, planting, growing, pruning,
grafting and pesticide use, and is still in print.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the bible," says Tony Kienitz, a Pasadena garden designer
who specializes in landscapes of vegetables and fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Creasy's success in finessing vegetables back into frontyards owes
much to her insistence on defining beauty as the wholesomeness of
vegetables. "It's an accepted cultural norm that the frontyard should
be beautiful," she says. "If you do an edible garden, do it with
style. I think that's the message. I tell people vegetable gardens
should have flowers in them because most beneficial insects need
flowers. Don't use old stockings to tie up tomatoes. Don't use old
plastic bottles. Don't hold out for the last zucchini from a spent
plant. Rangy stuff does not belong in the frontyard."</TE>
<TE>   Her curiosity about plants sparked a new hunger at the table.
Friend and Santa Cruz-based seed merchant Renee Shepherd began
popularizing new, exotic vegetables. Frilly lettuces and endive, she
and Creasy illustrated, could be used like fluffy skirts, or "under
planting" for other plants with more arching foliage, such as
peppers. Flowers could be studded among vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   As a romantic diversion, after noticing children gravitating to
her garden, Creasy began creating special themes to an ever-changing
series of plantings. Presently the theme is "fairy garden," and
children bring fuchsia flowers to a little fairy grotto. She also
grows sorrel for them to feed her chickens.</TE>
<TE>   But such whim does not cloud a sharply Darwinian attitude to
choosing good edible plants. Creasy doesn't blink at tossing out
troublesome or diseased specimens. Many of the vegetables growing
around her were planted in trials for seed companies. During growing,
Creasy will look for vigor, health and appearance. The trial
concludes at the chopping board and on the plate, and then Creasy
feeds tips back to us cooks.</TE>
<TE>   For example, gold basil, she thinks, has less minty astringency
than standard basil and is best for pesto. For artichokes, she
chooses the Italian purples whose baby flowers can be eaten raw. She
likes the wild arugula with real punch, and has to have Mexican
chiles.</TE>
<TE>   A key Creasy lesson, says Shepherd, is "to have the courage to
experiment, to change a garden."</TE>
<TE>   When Kienitz, the 41-year-old Pasadena designer began creating
kitchen gardens for clients nine years ago, the biggest obstacle with
the Creasy approach was that his customers would say, "It's so
pretty, we don't want to eat it." Undaunted, he opted for immersion
therapy, planting more and more food plants until he was creating
almost entirely edible landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   Kienitz is one of three gardeners to work on the Pasadena Arroyo
villa of Bonnie Saland and Mark Beck. Kienitz inherited the project
from garden designers Janie Malloy and Mark Bartos. What would have
been another pool and tennis court became a vineyard surrounded by
olive trees, lavender beds, pomegranate hedges and little plots of
fruits and vegetables tucked all over the place.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the grandiose sweep of hundreds of vines, the garden is
pure romance, scent and texture. Thyme grows over stone pavers,
rosemary brushes pants legs, lavender smells waft from near the olive
trees. The smells are matched by surprising tastes. Foraging in this
vineyard, treats await the trained eye. Keinitz eats a day lily
petal, which is sweet, strange and oddly decadent. Anise is let to go
to seed to create "plant candy," which Kienitz gives to children, or,
in the kitchen, uses as a garnish to brighten a sorrel and potato
soup.</TE>
<TE>   This is the deluxe version of edible gardening. Beck bottles about
600 bottles of his own wine each year. There are low-chill apples and
pears tucked on ledges, along with 20 varieties of blueberries in oak
barrel planters lining a path (blueberries are best grown in pots,
says Kienitz, because of their peat moss/acid needs).</TE>
<TE>   Precious few can afford this kind of setup, so it is refreshing to
discover that Kienitz's designs translate easily to a more modest
scale. For example, at the 2002 Pasadena Showcase House of Design,
Kienitz did a strictly edible garden using materials that could be
emulated with chunks of concrete or paving stones. After thoroughly
working a deep bed and improving the soil with compost and
fertilizer, he placed pavers in a concentric circle, then lined the
path with lettuces, tomatillos, blueberries, eggplant and cilantro.</TE>
<TE>   The seed and plant costs, he reckons, were no more than $300. For
height, there were artichokes and an apple sapling. Lettuce sat
pristine and almost otherworldly against a pebble mulch. This
spiraling salad garden is the soul of simplicity and wit.</TE>
<TE>   Mae Powell brought Kienitz in to advise on the edible garden of
her Pasadena ranch house three years ago. In an unorthodox
arrangement even by guerrilla kitchen-gardening standards, squash
grows out of the juniper and pumpkin winds up the lemon tree in the
frontyard. "Everyone calls me the pumpkin lady," she jokes.</TE>
<TE>   The jaunty gourd trellising is Powell's work, and the technique
was mastered at a course at the Arboretum of Los Angeles County. The
spooky mask propped on one was a prank, the work of a local doctor,
guesses Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Along the path to her front door, there is chard and zucchini and
half a dozen different tomato plants tucked here and there, including
Brandywine, Japanese Pinks and Beefsteak. Lettuces are packed tightly
together. This creates an artful look of abundanceand also holds
humidity, says Kienitz. In wet climates, this could lead to disease.
In dry Southern California, it's a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   Back at curbside, Kienitz pops a kumquat in his mouth, chewing it
skin and all. Edible gardening, it becomes clear, is a hobby for
nibblers. Snacks do grow on trees.</TE>
<TE>   As if Kienitz's spiraling lettuce gardens, Powell's Pasadena
pumpkin patch and Creasy's fairy grotto were not evidence enough that
edible landscapers are a shade unconventional, Marlena Ross of Culver
City proves the rule.</TE>
<TE>   Ross, the manager of a Westside counseling program for senior
citizens, lives in a nondescript 1948 bungalow on the edge of Culver
City. Twelve years ago, she wanted to do a Zen garden in the
frontyard using stone and bowling balls. But somehow she found
herself drawn to rare fruits. One tree led to another, and her front
garden is now a small jungle of more than 50 flowering fruit trees,
including magenta guava, allspice bushes, tangerines, jujubes,
peaches, nectarines, Pluots and sapote. Surinam cherries hang ripe
for the picking. You can't see the house.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't need a 'before' picture," she says. "You can just look
across the street."</TE>
<TE>   If the garden sounds over-planted, it has been done with great
artistry and wit. Five years ago, Ross completed the Master Gardening
course, and it shows. The trees are under-planted with salvias,
succulents and ornamental grasses. A winding brick path draws you
through a small forest with its own microclimate and perfumed fog.
Pink flamingos high step among the bowling balls. "Children call it
the 'magical' garden," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Ross is working on another garden, of a friend called Milt.
"Anytime Milt buys fruit, I say, 'Milt, are you crazy?' " Ross says.
"Between us, we have 85 trees."</TE>
<TE>   Ross is among dozens of trainees in the Master Gardening program
working on edible gardens. Projects included putting edible gardens
around transition homes for homeless people and in new apartment
blocks. Most of their stories ring with optimism and community
building. But not all.</TE>
<TE>   "People in this day and age seem to think that if there are fruit
trees or other edibles that are easily accessible, they are free to
help themselves," says Monique Bryher, a gardener in the Valley.
"They think nothing of trespassing and in fact are indignant when
confronted. I had this problem at a home I rented with apple trees
out front; if the thieves (that's what they are) didn't like the
fruit, they just hurled it. I've since observed similar behavior in
the neighborhood in which I currently live and have concluded that
edibles should remain in my backyard."</TE>
<TE>   Another Valley resident, environmentalist and actor Ed Begley Jr.,
came to a different conclusion when passersby began picking fruit
from his plum trees. What irked Begley wasn't that they were taking
the fruit, but that they were picking it unripe. "I think they were
lacking knowledge," he says. "The plums don't get sweet that way. So
I put a sign up, said, 'Hey, take some fruit, just save some for the
person who planted and waters the tree." Then he added picking
instructions: "By the way, the fruit should nearly fall into your
hand, and that's when you know it's ripe."</TE>
<TE>   If produce theft is a common crime, it is not commonly reported.
From the Los Angeles Police Department, information officer Jason Lee
says, "In 16 years, I haven't heard of stolen fruit."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the gardens have a storybook or European look. But one of
the most eccentric frontyard gardens could not look more
all-American. In La Canada Flintridge, Carrie Mulfinger plants corn
interspersed with California poppies along the front walk. It has a
sort of American Gothic simplicity to it. The idea started as an
edible prelude to Halloween. "We did a corn maze for trick or
treaters," says Mulfinger. "The neighbors didn't approve, but the
kids loved it."</TE>
<TE>   Repairing the lawn from a full-blown maze proved too much work.
This year they were content just to line the walk. The poppies are
just coming out to make room for more corn.</TE>
<TE>   It may look wacky to outside eyes, but there is unexpected poetry,
a kind of simple rapture, to be had from growing your dinner by the
front walk. "I just love the sound of the corn in the breeze," says
Mulfinger.</TE>

<LD>   Here, honeydew melon, fresh mint and a good, fruity Gewurztraminer
make for a cooling combination. A spoon of low-fat peach yogurt adds
a touch of sweetness and smooths out the flavor of the soup. You

<HD>Such a Fragile Pleasure: An Apricot Worth the Wait</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KARP</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Apricots have been available in stores since late April, but real
aficionados have been waiting for the locally grown Blenheims, which
are just now ripening and will be around for another few weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The Blenheim has every possible commercial flaw: It's smaller and
less highly colored than modern varieties. When picked ripe, it's too
perishable to ship. And its delicate insides turn to mush in the
brutal heat of the San Joaquin Valley, where most apricots are grown
today.</LD>
<LD>   There's only one reason it's so beloved: flavor. Bite into a ripe
Blenheim, whether pale yellow-orange, or deeper orange with a
freckled, rosy blush, and the juice explodes in your mouth (and will
dribble onto your shirt if you're not careful). The luscious flesh is
honey-sweet, balanced by a tinge of acidity in specimens that are not
overripe. Most vitally, the Blenheim has a sensual perfume, a
mysterious complexity lacking in even the best modern varieties.</LD>
<TE>   The nomenclature of the Blenheim and its sister variety, the
Royal, is much confused. The Blenheim was originally called
Shipley's, because it was raised from a seed sown by a Miss Shipley,
the daughter of a gardener to the Duke of Marlborough at Blenheim
Palace in England before 1830. The Royal arose from a seed of the
Peche de Nancy apricot planted in 1808 by the director of the
Luxembourg Garden in Paris; it was so named because King Louis XVIII
found it supremely delicious.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 19th century the Royal and the Blenheim were grown as
distinct varieties, but by 1920 they were sold indiscriminately by
many California nurseries, and today many farmers call them both
Royal Blenheim. Connoisseurs say that the Blenheim is a bit larger
and has a rounder stone, while the Royal is slightly flattened,
almost wedge-shaped, but it's a distinction that's hardly worth
worrying over. Both ripen from the inside out, so that even pale
fruits can be explosively juicy and flavorful.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 20th century the Southland produced a third of
California's apricot crop, but the trees were not as productive as
those grown elsewhere, and with the added pressure of development,
commercial cultivation has almost disappeared in these parts. It's
still possible to grow your own tree, of course, though that means
battling the squirrels that delight in biting the sweetest parts of
every ripe fruit before you can pick them.</TE>
<TE>   It's easier to buy from the few remaining growers, which also
encourages them to keep growing this finicky crop. Show up early at
farmers markets, before the fruits are pawed over, and bring a flat
box so that they don't get squished on the way home. They cost about
$2 a pound; a small price for such pleasure.</TE>

<HD>Mutton Is Just Older, Wiser, Tastier Lamb</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roast a big piece of meat until half-done. Take it out of the oven,
gash it to the bone in several places and rub the cuts with salt and
cayenne; save the juices. Then throw this multiply-butterflied chunk
of protein, like a folio of steaks bound together, on the grill until
good and brown. Add the saved juices to a relish of pickled
mushrooms.</LD>
<LD>   "The reader will scarcely need to be told," wrote Eliza Acton in
"Modern Cooking for Private Families," "that this is an excellent
dish."</LD>
<LD>   The year was 1845. The dish was the Cavalier's Broil. And even
though its instructions run counter to much of what we now take for
granted in cooking meat, it's so utterly efficient and its flavors so
modern, it could have been invented yesterday.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, there may not be a better way to cook leg of lamb. The
Cavalier's Broil has a dark, tasty crust, a juicy medium-rare
interior and an elegant, uncluttered seasoning. Best of all, it needs
only 20 minutes on the grill.</TE>
<TE>   It's a traditional recipe for a meat that is scarcely part of our
tradition anymore: mutton. You can use lamb instead, just as you can
in other mutton recipes of 19th century American cookbooks, but
they'd be even better with the real thing. Mutton is richer and
meatier than lamb, just as beef is richer and meatier than veal.</TE>
<TE>   These days a lot of people are convinced, without ever having
tasted it, that mutton must be coarse, tallowy and rank. But down to
the beginning of the 20th century, it was always more popular than
lamb, Pennsylvania, Virginia and North Carolina being particularly
known for their fine mutton. (Where was Scarlett O'Hara going in the
first scene of "Gone With the Wind"? To a barbecue of hickory-roasted
pork and mutton.)</TE>
<TE>   The typical 19th century American cookbook would include a diagram
of the cuts of mutton, but never one for lamb. One reason is that the
cuts of lamb didn't matter much. The various parts of mutton might
figure in stews and meat pies and other complex dishes, but a lamb
went straight to the oven or the roasting spit. "The best way of
cooking lamb is to roast it," declared Eliza Leslie in her
influential "Directions for Cooking" (1837); "when drest otherwise,
it is insipid, and not so good as mutton."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Mutton Was King</TE>
<TE>   Back then, by the way, people would have been amazed by the modern
cult of rare lamb. "Lamb, like veal and pork, is not eatable unless
thoroughly done," wrote Leslie; "no one preferring it rare, as is
frequently the case with beef and mutton." Nearly 60 years later,
Fannie Farmer would agree.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, much depends on what you mean by "lamb" and "mutton."
In the past, a lot of lamb was spring lamb, 6 to 8 weeks old, though
the meat of animals up to one year still counted as lamb. The USDA
now considers 12 months the dividing line between lamb and mutton.
The French raise the bar to 14 months, and on Welsh sheep farms,
mutton commonly begins at 18 months. At least everybody agrees that a
5-year-old sheep is probably too old and tough to cook.</TE>
<TE>   There was a whole repertoire of regional mutton dishes, such as
Irish stew, Scotch broth and Lancashire hotpot (a casserole of meat
layered with potatoes). People of Welsh descent salted legs of mutton
like hams. Hotel breakfast menus offered broiled mutton chops; roast
saddle of mutton was a special-occasion dish. Even the French knew of
Reform cutlets, served at the famous Reform Club in London:
butter-sauteed mutton chops in a breading that was half minced ham.</TE>
<TE>   But mutton fell out of favor during the 20th century, even in the
British Commonwealth, the traditional home of mutton connoisseurship.
"Over the past 40 years, mutton has virtually disappeared from our
shops and menus," laments the Web site of Graig Farm, Dolau, Wales.
In New Zealand, Horizon Lamb &amp; Mutton reports that it now slaughters
four times as many lambs as sheep and sells its mutton mostly to
Asia. (In Indian markets you sometimes find New Zealand corned
mutton, a canned product invented to satisfy the dietary constraints
of Hindus and Muslims.)</TE>
<TE>   Graig Farm blames the decline on changes in farming style and a
faster lifestyle. Mutton requires more investment from the farmer,
longer aging and more careful handling by the meat industry and
longer cooking by the consumer.</TE>
<TE>   All these objections go double in our country, where many people
already think lamb is too gamy and fear that mutton will be even
worse. (Actually, gaminess can be more noticeable in lamb because it
has a milder meat flavor.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Real Kentucky Barbecue</TE>
<TE>   The exception to the trend is Owensboro, Ky., located near where
Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky meet. To the outside world, Owensboro
is probably best known as the hometown of no fewer than 6 NASCAR
drivers, including Michael and Darryl Waltrip, or maybe as the
headquarters of the International Bluegrass Music Assn. To itself,
it's the barbecue capital of the world--and when they say "barbecue"
in Owensboro, they mean barbecued mutton.</TE>
<TE>   The area was settled in the early 1800s by people from Wales, who
had sheepherding in their blood. (Even today, there are nearly four
sheep per person in Wales--15% of the sheep in the European Union.)
On top of that, the tariff of 1816 had encouraged an American wool
industry. Between one thing and another, there were more than 11,000
sheep in Daviess County by the 1860s.</TE>
<TE>   From time to time, the herdsmen had to cull older sheep from their
flocks, and somehow--locals are vague about how this
happened--barbecuing came to be the main way of cooking the meat,
though mutton does show up in the local version of Kentucky burgoo, a
stew of mixed meats.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, mutton barbecues became important church
fund-raisers. Owensboro's first recorded mutton barbecue, on July 4,
1834, was held at a Baptist church, but local Catholics have been
particularly active barbecuers. Mount St. Joseph's convent school
alone sells about two tons of barbecued mutton at its annual
barbecue. Today there's at least one fund-raising picnic in the
Owensboro area nearly every week in May and June.</TE>
<TE>   So the taste for mutton flourished in Owensboro even while it was
going into eclipse everywhere else. In fact, it even survived the
disappearance of the local sheep industry. Owensboro's half-dozen
barbecue restaurants now get their mutton from out of state.</TE>
<TE>   Mutton aside, Owensboro doesn't seem exotic. It's an old, leafy
city, fairly large for this part of the country (population 55,000),
in the rolling country of the Ohio Valley. But if you take the
Parrish Avenue exit from US 60 (Wendell Ford Expressway) on the west
side of town and head east four blocks, you'll see the Moonlite
Bar-B-Q Inn, the biggest mutton dispensary in the country. It moves
10,000 pounds of sheep meat a week.</TE>
<TE>   You can't miss it. Out front there's a black iron pot big enough
to boil a hippo in, symbolizing Owensboro's annual World Barbecue
Festival, held the second weekend in May. A sign welcomes you to
"Owensboro, the World Capital of Barbecue." The huge parking lot is
dominated by another that reads, "If It's Not Owensboro Barbecue,
It's Not Real Barbecue."</TE>
<TE>   When Hugh and Catherine Bosley bought the Moonlite Bar-B-Q Inn in
1963, it seated 35; now it seats 350 and has 120 employees, and
though chicken, beef and pork have been moving up, mutton still
accounts for most of its business.</TE>
<TE>   "About half our customers are from Daviess County," says marketing
director Pat Bosley. "But 8% come from out of state. There are pilots
who fly in from nearby Air Force bases and have barbecue." The number
of out-of-staters is bound to go up--this seems to be the year the
outside world has discovered Owensboro, with sizable mentions in the
recent "Celebrating Barbecue" by Dotty Griffith (Simon &amp; Schuster)
and "The Barbecue America Cookbook" by Rick Browne and Jack Bettridge
(Lyons Press).</TE>
<TE>   To the left of the restaurant's busy gift shop (barbecue sauces,
Moonlite bill caps, country hams) is the entrance to the butchering
operation. Bosley shows a cold room where mutton carcasses hang. "I
figure I buy 10% of the fat ewes for sale in the country," he says.
"The average lamb might run 70 pounds. I look for a 2-year-old sheep
weighing about 150 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly they're from what I call the Midwest--Texas, Colorado,
Minnesota, Iowa and the Dakotas. There are only five major plants in
the country that slaughter sheep of any age. Two or three are in
Texas. They ship most of their mutton to Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mutton by Mail</TE>
<TE>   The reason for having a butchering operation, complete with a
resident USDA inspector, on the restaurant's premises is that the
Moonlite also sells meat wholesale to restaurants, grocery stores,
schools and Wal-Marts from Louisville to Paducah. It doesn't ship raw
mutton out of the area, alas.</TE>
<TE>   But it does ship barbecued mutton, cooked for about 12 hours in
huge double-deck hickory pits 24 feet long and so deep the cooks have
to move the meat around with pitchforks. You can order sliced mutton
or chopped mutton, the latter being trimmings, which some people
prefer because they include extra-browned bits.</TE>
<TE>   The Owensboro way of serving mutton is on a hamburger bun with
barbecue sauce, sliced onions and pickles, accompanied by a thin
sauce called "dip"--mostly vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce
and spices. This is about all that's left of America's centuries-old
mutton tradition. But sheep meat seems to have struck deep roots in
northwestern Kentucky, so Owensboro barbecue should be around a long
time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   To give an idea what mutton cookery was like, here's a recipe
adapted from Eliza Acton's "Modern Cookery for Private Families"
(1845); the dish had been known for at least 100 years before that.
In the absence of mutton, we used lamb.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LAMB</TE>
<TE>   1 (5-pound) shoulder or half leg of lamb or mutton</TE>
<TE>   3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Place the lamb in a roasting dish and cook 50 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the lamb from the oven to a large dish. Make 3 (5-inch)
cuts down to the bone on each side, if using the shoulder, or 4 cuts
to the bone through the meatiest part of the leg, and rub the cayenne
and salt into the cuts. Let the meat sit in the dish 5 minutes and
save the juices that drain.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, heat the grill to medium-high.</TE>
<TE>   Grill the lamb and cook, turning once, until the meat at the bone
is cooked medium-rare, 25 to 30 minutes, or until a meat thermometer
registers 140 degrees. Remove from the grill and let sit 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PICKLED MUSHROOMS</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound mushrooms</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 cup apple cider vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon mace or nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   Cut the mushrooms in quarters and place them in a skillet.
Sprinkle generously with salt and cook, covered, over low heat, 10
minutes. They will release a thin juice. Drain, let the mushrooms
cool and squeeze them out in a cloth.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, place the vinegar in a small skillet or saucepan with
the cayenne, ginger and mace or nutmeg. Bring to a boil, reduce the
heat and simmer 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the mushrooms and the vinegar. (They can be used
immediately or kept tightly covered for several months.) Mince half
of the mushrooms. Place the mushrooms and the lamb juices from the
plate into a skillet and cook over medium-high heat until sizzling
hot. Serve with the lamb.</TE>

<TE>   2 tablespoons water</TE>
<TE>   1 cup panko</TE>
<TE>   2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, about 1/2 pound total</TE>
<TE>   Fill a large pot three-fourths full with water. Add 1 tablespoon
of olive oil and salt to taste and bring to a boil over high heat.
Add the linguine, stir and cook until al dente, about 11 minutes.
Drain.</TE>
<TE>   While the water comes to a boil, place the pine nuts, garlic,
mint, chives, dill, basil and chervil in the work bowl of a food
processor. Turn the motor on and slowly add the remaining 1/4 cup of
olive oil. Add 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.
Process until a smooth paste is formed, stopping occasionally to
scrape down the sides with a spatula. Add the yogurt and mix well.
Set the pesto aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and heat
to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, place the flour in a bowl. In another bowl, lightly
beat together the egg and water. Place the panko in a third bowl.
Carefully pound each chicken breast between 2 pieces of plastic wrap
with the smooth side of a meat mallet until about 1/2 inch thick.
Season both sides of the breasts with salt and pepper. Dip each
breast in flour, then the egg mixture, then the panko. Carefully
place the chicken into the hot oil. Cook until golden brown, about 3
to 5 minutes on each side.</TE>
<TE>   To serve, mix about 1/2 cup of the herb pesto with the hot
linguine. Place on a serving platter. Cut the chicken breasts into
1/2-inch slices with a sharp knife. Fan out on top of the linguine.
Top the chicken with more of the herb pesto.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: I'm looking for a recipe for the Chocolate Chewies at
Torrance Bakery in Torrance. They are the best chocolate cookies I
have ever had! They are similar to a brownie and are loaded with
walnuts. I would forever be in your debt if you could get the recipe.</LD>
<LD>   JODI MORIOKA</LD>
<LD>   Torrance</LD>
<TE>   DEAR JODI: Let's not get carried away.</TE>
<TE>   Send requests to Culinary SOS, Food Section, Los Angeles Times,

<TE>   Torrance Bakery Chocolate Chewies</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Rather than cracking a number of eggs, you can buy cartons of
liquid egg whites at supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   1 cup egg whites</TE>
<TE>   1 3/4 cups Dutch-process cocoa powder</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   5 1/2 cups powdered sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 pound walnut or pecan pieces</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment
paper.</TE>
<TE>   Mix together the egg whites, cocoa, salt and sugar on medium speed
until the batter is stiff and all ingredients are well incorporated,
about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the walnuts or pecans by hand.</TE>
<TE>   Place the batter by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the baking sheet;
work in batches. Bake until the cookies are a bit shiny and slightly
cracked, 10 minutes. They will look underdone but do not overbake.</TE>

<TE>   MARIA ELENA JOHNSON</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   DEAR MARIA ELENA: This mango salsa recipe is from an article by

<LD>This tall, slim glass from Riedel Crystal isn't for wine--it's
designed to show off the aromas and flavors of fine tequilas.
Introduced recently in Mexico, the glass stands 8 1/4 inches tall and
holds up to 6 3/4 ounces. The traditional Mexican caballito, a
slender small glass, suits the custom of swallowing the beverage in a
single gulp. This glass, designed by the Austrian firm in
consultation with tequila producers, is for serious tasting.</LD>
<LD>   Riedel Crystal tequila glass, $9 to $12 at fine wine and spirits
shops such as Wally's, (310) 475-0606, and the Wine House, (310)
479-3731, in West Los Angeles and Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa,

<HD>The Rich Vines of Cape Town</HD>
<DH>From the new South Africa come wines of international
distinction and a style all their own</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>CAPE TOWN, South Africa</DL>
<LD>It is the geography that first inspires awe: a glittering city rising
from the sparkling Cape of Good Hope toward the imposing granite
edifice called Table Mountain. For miles around, the craggy landscape
is accented by vineyards basking in the ocean-tempered sun. Its
dramatic combination of history, sleek urbanity and superb natural
surroundings puts Cape Town among the world's handful of glamorous
wine centers, with the likes of San Francisco and Sydney, Australia.</LD>
<LD>   It almost looks like a stage set--which is appropriate to the
moment, as the Cape wine community makes its grand entrance in the
wine world.</LD>
<LD>   And what an entrance. Even six or eight years ago most wine lovers
were only vaguely aware of South African wines. Now it feels as
though the Cape region has come out of nowhere, fully formed and
highly polished.</LD>
<TE>   Suddenly, fine South African wines are appearing on the best wine
lists and wine shop shelves. The Sauvignon Blancs, in particular, are
stunning. More important, they're distinctive, with a combination of
crisp acidity and ripe green fruit flavors that says "South Africa."
Close behind are red wines of powerful richness and elegance,
especially Shiraz (the Africans have adopted the Aussie term for
Syrah) and Merlot-Cabernet blends. Wine enthusiasts are also
beginning to appreciate Pinotage, a spicy, smoke-inflected South
African red from a grape created by crossing Pinot Noir with
Cinsault.</TE>
<TE>   The perception of immaculate birth is deceptive. In fact, the Cape
is one of the New World's oldest wine regions. Cape Town was
established in 1652, and the settlers began making wine shortly
thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   South African wines were well-known in Europe during the next two
centuries, and would be as established now as wines from California
or Australia, if not for the government's racist apartheid policy.
Sanctions stifled the economy for three decades. The wine industry
was isolated from the rapid development taking place in other wine
regions. It wasn't until Nelson Mandela left his cell at Robben
Island in 1990 and was elected president in '94 that the South
African economy revived. At that point, its viticultural industry
rejoined the greater wine world.</TE>
<TE>   The global snub had been devastating. Still, the Cape wine
industry has burst forth with remarkable unity and focus, much like
vines that yield extraordinary wine after enduring a bitterly cold
winter.</TE>
<TE>   The Springfield Winery Sauvignon Blanc called "Life From Stone" is
a prime example. Winemaker Abrie Bruwer's family has been growing
grapes in the Robertson area, east of Cape Town, for generations, but
it wasn't until the '90s that Bruwer sharpened his viticulture and
winemaking. He traveled to Sancerre, the Sauvignon world's spiritual
home, to commune with the likes of terroir guru Didier Dagueneau.
Back home, he revised his cultivation and winemaking practices and
began keeping wines from distinctive vine blocks separate.</TE>
<TE>   All that culminated in the initial '99 "Life From Stone," made
from vines growing in weathered quartzite gravel. In its bold
minerality, piercing herbaceousness and underlying peachiness, it
resembled nothing so much as a Loire Valley Sauvignon on a heroic
scale. Subsequent vintages have been equally impressive. Its
companion bottling, the "Special Cuvee," comes from sandy soil that
expresses a slightly different texture, like peach fuzz over steel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Growing Refinement</TE>
<TE>   "Life From Stone" has a double meaning: The arid ground is
littered with prehistoric artifacts. (Archeologists know the estate
well.) As I walked the vineyard with Bruwer under the blazing African
sky, he showed how the rows are oriented to track the sun and pointed
out differences in canopy management on the two different soil types.
"We've only been growing wine in this country for the last 10 years,"
he observed. "Before that we were only growing grapes."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the entire industry seems to have experienced that
epiphany simultaneously. Every appellation has its own viticultural
association, every grape variety a focus group dedicated to refining
its expressions. Individual bravado shows up in clever and flamboyant
proprietary names such as "Life From Stone" and Fairview Winery's
"Goats Do Roam" (a play on Cotes-du-Rhone). At the same time, the
unified commitment of South African wine producers to the common
cause--selling their wines to the rest of the world--is astonishing.
Not even Napa Valley, the most effectively marketed wine region in
California, can match it.</TE>
<TE>   For example, virtually every South African wine is produced
according to a protocol called Integrated Production of Wine, or IPW.
Established in 1998, the IPW is not so much a body of regulations as
an attitude toward environmentally friendly wine production. It aims
to quantify an environmental ethic through guidelines for growers and
winemakers that begin with soil preparation and extend through
cultivation and cellar practices, all the way through use of
recyclable packaging materials.</TE>
<TE>   The IPW program can be seen as a collective, home-grown version of
international business certification programs. Virtually the entire
South African wine industry has voluntarily subscribed to IPW--some
4,500 growers and 350 cellars, representing more than 99% of
production.</TE>
<TE>   Another significant attitude that the South Africans share is
cherishing and preserving grand old vines. As in California and
Australia, most of their old vineyards have disappeared over time.
Typically, old plantings have only survived through isolated efforts
or neglect. Now the old vines have been recognized for their
patrimonial value.</TE>
<TE>   Flagstone Wines is among the most committed. Proprietors Graham
Knox and Bruce Jack make wines from the "furthest, oldest, highest,
wettest, coldest, driest, riskiest blocks of vines, those with the
deepest roots, smallest berries, and thickest skins," Jack said.
"Throughout the Cape there are unique spots where a variety and its
rootstock have found a special home and a passionate mentor. This
perfect match has often meant that a vineyard reaches a great age."</TE>
<TE>   The first Flagstone wines, from the '00 vintage, include such
beauties as the luscious, figgy "Green on Green" Semillon, from an
old plot in the warm Wellington area, and the intensely concentrated
"Snowfield" Chardonnay from vines on an arid mountainside nearly
3,000 feet above sea level.</TE>
<TE>   Wines from vineyards like that express real character. But so do
wines from less extreme situations where grape varieties are
perfectly matched to terroir. Steenberg Sauvignon Blanc, for example,
shows the high-toned verve and ripe green berry character of the
Constantia district in the lee of the Cape.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lots of Character</TE>
<TE>   More to the point is the way Vergelegen Estate Red, with its
larger-than-life Bordeaux character, expresses the nature of an area
within the greater Stellenbosch district, which roughly embraces 60%
of the Cape's 400-odd wineries.</TE>
<TE>   At this point the Cape's appellation blueprint, called "Wine of
Origin," defines the vineyard areas in broad strokes as nesting
geographical units. It's set up to accommodate virtually endless
refinement, as new appellations are identified and slotted into the
framework.</TE>
<TE>   And just as Bordeaux, Burgundy, and other established wine regions
contain distinctive viticultural zones, the greater Cape has enclaves
that are demonstrating distinctive characteristics.</TE>
<TE>   Tasting along as the South Africans map their sensory landscape
will be interesting, indeed. Assuming, of course, that they can keep
up the pace.</TE>

<TE>   Sampling the New Style</TE>
<TE>   Here are some wines that exemplify the new South African style,
and stores that carry them. They can also be found by searching the
Internet for the name of the wine.</TE>
<TE>   2001 Thelema Sauvignon Blanc: Balanced in every direction, full
and somewhat rich, yet lilting and crisp. At Hi-Time Wine Cellars,
Costa Mesa, (949) 650-8463. $18.</TE>
<TE>   2001 Mulderbosch Sauvignon Blanc: A brilliant combination of ripe
green fruit, floral peach perfume and fine minerality. At Wine House,
West L.A., (310) 479-3731, and Woodland Hills Wine Co., Woodland
Hills, (818) 222-1111. $19-$22.</TE>
<TE>   2001 Nitida Sauvignon Blanc: Beautifully clear Sauvignon character
from perfume to finish. At Southern Hemisphere Wine Center,
Huntington Beach, (714) 892-3030; www.sawineco.com. $12.</TE>
<TE>   2001 Villiera Chenin Blanc: Lusciously honeyed with acidity to
balance the richness from partial barrel fermentation. At Southern
Hemisphere Wine Center, Huntington Beach, (714) 892-3030;
www.sawineco.com. $10.</TE>
<TE>   1999 Rustenberg "John X Merriman": A convincing Bordeaux-style red
blend (mostly Merlot with Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc). Tobacco
meets black cherry in a complex, supple red that's well worth aging.
At Hi-Time Wine Cellars, Costa Mesa, (949) 650-8463, and Southern
Hemisphere Wine Center, Huntington Beach, (714) 892-3030;
www.sawineco.com. $19-$25.</TE>
<TE>   2001 Neil Ellis Sauvignon Blanc "Groenekloof": A sea-cooled slope
north of Cape Town yields this lovely example of how the Cape's
Sauvignons bridge the stylistic gap between Sancerre and New
Zealand--green and racy yet lusciously ripe. At Woodland Hills Wine
Co., Woodland Hills, (818) 222-1111. $15</TE>
<TE>   2000 Delheim Pinotage: Zesty red fruit and soft tannin. Zinfandel
fans will appreciate the bright raspberry flavor and dollop of
American oak. At Wine House, West L.A., (310) 479-3731, and Woodland
Hills Wine Co., Woodland Hills, (818) 222-1111. $15.</TE>

<LD>1999 Domaine La Garrigue Vacqueyras, Southern Rhone, France.</LD>
<LD>   Vacqueyras used to be classed as Cotes-du-Rhone Villages, one step
up from basic Cotes-du-Rhone, but the best wines of this pretty
village near Gigondas have always had more concentration and power
than its neighbors'. A dozen years ago, the French recognized that by
giving Vacqueyras its own appellation.</LD>
<LD>   The 1999 Domaine La Garrigue shows what a beguiling wine
Vacqueyras can be in a great vintage. This one has everything I love
in a southern Rhone--beautiful color, explosive fruit, lots of earthy
character and a soupcon of the character the French call sauvage, or
wild.</LD>
<TE>   About $12. Available at Beverage Warehouse in Marina del Rey,
(310) 306-2822; John and Pete's Liquor in West Hollywood, (310)
657-3080; Topline Wine &amp; Spirits in Glendale, (818) 500-9670; and

<HD>Adelphia Submits Bankruptcy Filing</HD>
<DH>Cable: The firm, the nation's sixth-largest provider and
the leader in Southern California, was plagued by accounting scandals
involving its founder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp., the nation's sixth-largest cable
provider and the leader in Southern California, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection late Tuesday, plagued by one of the biggest
accounting scandals in corporate history.</LD>
<LD>   The bankruptcy filing, one of the largest ever, had been expected
for weeks, following the disclosure of $3 billion in off-the-books
borrowings by Adelphia's founding Rigas family.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia's nearly 6 million customers nationwide--and 1.2 million
in Southern California--are unlikely to see any immediate change in
their television service. The company said late Tuesday that it would
continue to operate as usual during bankruptcy proceedings, while
working on a reorganization plan to restructure its debt and get back
on track.</LD>
<TE>   The company is expected to downsize and sell assets to reduce
debts. Among the properties that could be sold are its prized local
cable systems in communities such as Los Angeles, Beverly Hills,
Pacific Palisades, Santa Monica, Brentwood and Redondo Beach and in
Orange and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's filing comes amid a flurry of accounting scandals on
Wall Street. Federal regulators are investigating the bookkeeping
practices of companies including Enron Corp., Adelphia and WorldCom
Inc., which disclosed Tuesday that nearly $4 billion in expenses were
improperly accounted for.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's bankruptcy filing also marks the speedy fall from grace
of John Rigas, the folksy 77-year-old son of Greek immigrants who was
known for his small-town charm and family values. Rigas pulled
adult-oriented TV channels off cable systems in Los Angeles shortly
after Adelphia purchased Southern California's largest cable
provider, Century Communications Corp., in late 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas founded Adelphia in 1952 with $300 and built it into a cable
powerhouse from the hamlet of Coudersport, Pa. During the go-go cable
merger madness of the late 1990s, when cable values peaked and many
industry pioneers became billionaires by selling out, Rigas told
cable cronies that he would not sell because his three sons were
eager to take over the company.</TE>
<TE>   Last month Rigas and his sons were forced to relinquish control of
the company in the face of federal probes, two state grand jury
investigations, scores of shareholder lawsuits and a cash crisis that
has reduced the value of Adelphia's stock by 99%. On Tuesday,
Adelphia's shares traded at 14 cents in the over-the-counter market.</TE>
<TE>   The company was delisted from Nasdaq this month for failing to
file its 2001 annual report. Adelphia admitted that it inflated
revenue and earnings and misled investors by claiming an additional
47,000 subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Under Adelphia's interim Chief Executive Erland Kailbourne, the
company fired auditor Deloitte &amp; Touche because of potential
conflicts of interest resulting from its audit of both the public
company and the Rigas family partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Tuesday, Kailbourne said the bankruptcy filing was
the company's best chance for survival: "The action was taken to
stabilize Adelphia's financial foundation and to continue quality
service to our customers.... Entering into these proceedings will
enable us to fully evaluate our enterprise without the immediate
pressure to sell valuable assets that may well benefit the company in
the future."</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to stave off a bankruptcy filing, in recent weeks
Kailbourne had put up for sale cable systems serving 3 million
customers. But potential suitors, including cable mogul Paul Allen,
shied away because of the uncertain liabilities they would face in
such a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say the filing took longer than expected because Adelphia
had difficulties pulling together the financing it needed to operate
in Chapter 11. On Tuesday, the company announced that J.P. Morgan
Chase Bank and Citigroup USA had agreed to provide $1.5 billion to
cover operating costs.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia said the money would enable the company to continue
paying employees, city franchise authorities and program suppliers
and to upgrade its networks with digital technologies.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say customers could experience lapses in service as a
result of Adelphia's reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see some delays and interruptions in service if
Adelphia downsizes, stops hiring, or if its employees get nervous and
start leaving," said Ivan Kallick, a bankruptcy lawyer at Manatt,
Phelps &amp; Phillips who is an Adelphia customer. "But you won't be
watching Tom Brokaw and suddenly have your cable go out."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials also fear that the bankruptcy filing could
further delay Adelphia's transition to digital TV.</TE>
<TE>   The city also is concerned that Adelphia will miss a payment due
Sunday of about $1.7 million for cable franchise fees. Cable
operators pay the city 5% of their revenues every quarter for the
right to offer service. Given the local budget crisis, city officials
say they can ill afford delinquencies.</TE>
<TE>   Few cable companies have ever filed for bankruptcy. Though
start-ups such as Colorado-based Winfirst, which was awarded a local
cable franchise, have run out of money trying to duplicate existing
cable networks, most established cable operators are cash cows
because they enjoy a monopoly in their markets.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia had one of the highest debt levels in the cable industry
after an acquisition spree in the late '90s. Adelphia's sizable debt
made it vulnerable when accounting irregularities were first
disclosed in late March.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Adelphia has revealed numerous examples of possible
self-dealings by the Rigases, including a $150-million loan from
Adelphia to the family's professional hockey team, the Buffalo
Sabres. The family also was building a world-class golf course on the
outskirts of Coudersport. Several million dollars in Adelphia funds
also helped pay for a movie produced by Rigas' daughter.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Asks U.S. Judge to Throw Out Verdict</HD>
<DH>Courts: Accounting firm claims flawed reasoning, improper
instructions led to obstruction conviction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accounting firm Arthur Andersen asked a federal judge Tuesday to set
aside its June 15 conviction on obstruction of justice or grant a new
trial, saying jurors reached their decision through flawed reasoning
and improper instructions.</LD>
<LD>   In a motion filed in U.S. District Court in Houston, Andersen said
the verdict is "insupportable" because jurors based their decision to
convict on conduct that wasn't a crime and hadn't been cited in its
indictment.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department has not seen the filing and had no
immediate comment about it, spokesman Bryan Sierra said. But he
added: "We believe the jury's verdict was sound."</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors had argued that Andersen violated the law by ordering
the destruction of paper and electronic files related to its audit of
Enron Corp. with the intent of impeding a Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry. But several jurors said after the verdict that
they found much of the evidence of shredding to be superficial.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, jurors said they focused on an Oct. 16 e-mail in which
Andersen staff lawyer Nancy Temple suggested deleting certain
potentially damaging lines from a memo being drafted by David B.
Duncan, Andersen's Houston-based partner who led the Enron audit
team. The jury found Temple had criminal intent when she asked Duncan
to alter the document.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen said the jury's explanation "leaves no doubt that the
verdict was illegitimate." The firm claimed Temple didn't urge Duncan
to alter a document within the meaning of the language in the
obstruction statute.</TE>
<TE>   Changing an original document by whiting out the date and
substituting a false one, Andersen said, could constitute illegal
alteration. But "suggesting edits to a draft memorandum" does not,
the firm argued.</TE>
<TE>   "It would defy common sense to conclude that commenting on a draft
document ... constitutes obstruction of justice," the firm said in
its motion. "Indeed, if collaboration ... may so easily be a crime,
virtually every law firm in the United States engages in criminal
conduct every day."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also contended the jury's belief that Temple's e-mail
amounted to corrupt conduct should be grounds for reversal because it
was not cited in the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had cited Temple's e-mail as evidence that Andersen
feared an SEC probe and therefore had an improper motive to shred
documents. But the prosecution did not argue that Temple's e-mail
itself was an act of obstruction.</TE>
<TE>   "Andersen thus had no notice that Ms. Temple's e-mail of proposed
edits could be regarded as a criminal act," the motion said, adding
that the firm would have defended itself on that front if it had
known it would be grounds for conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also said U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon provided the
jury with erroneous instructions on the legal definition of
"corrupt." Andersen had argued for an instruction that would tell the
jury they had to agree that the firm used an improper method, such as
bribery, in order to persuade employees to dispose of documents.
Harmon instead gave the jury a less restrictive instruction.</TE>

<HD>Study of Suspected Carcinogen Rattles Snack Firms</HD>
<DH>Food: World Health Organization will discuss research
results this week. Industry calls for more testing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new round of tests showing high levels of a suspected carcinogen in
French fries, potato chips and other starchy snack foods is throwing
a scare into the food industry.</LD>
<LD>   Fearing panic among consumers and slumping sales, industry
officials are conducting their own tests and putting out statements
intended to calm fears that acrylamide, a substance that causes
cancer in animals, might pose a human health risk in food.</LD>
<LD>   The latest tests, conducted by the Center for Science in the
Public Interest and disclosed Tuesday, echo findings of a Swedish
government study in April that showed high levels of acrylamide--a
substance used to make plastics and purify water--in French fries,
potato chips and other starchy food cooked at high temperatures.</LD>
<TE>   The World Health Organization is holding a special meeting of
scientists this week at its Geneva headquarters to discuss results of
research done in Sweden, Norway and Britain and set priorities for
further research. It is expected to make recommendations Thursday to
food agencies and consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt there was a real urgency to do something," said Gregory
Hartl, spokesman for the WHO. "There have been other studies that
have found more or less similar findings" to the original Swedish
government report.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are
attending the meeting, and FDA officials said they had begun testing
for acrylamide in food from "a variety of products and sources."</TE>
<TE>   However, the agency said, it was not cautioning consumers to steer
clear of any particular products.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, until further recommendations from the WHO, the FDA is
urging consumers to eat foods from a "wide variety of sources."</TE>
<TE>   The scare comes as French fry consumption already appears to be
leveling off because of health concerns. French fry consumption had
risen for much of the 1990s, with Americans eating an average of
about 28 pounds per person each year. However, in the year ending
June 30, consumption is expected to drop 1%, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. More bad health news could worsen what
appears to be a growing glut of French fries.</TE>
<TE>   The findings of the Swedish government study in April took the
industry by surprise. Food companies have begun their own testing.
Many also have found the chemical but have not found it in levels as
high as those pinpointed overseas, said Gene Grabowski of the Grocery
Manufacturers of America.</TE>
<TE>   Acrylamide appears to be formed by a chemical reaction during
cooking. The new study found high levels of acrylamide in starchy
foods that were baked or fried at high temperatures, including
cereal, taco shells and fries. Boiled potatoes did not contain the
same high levels. Baked potatoes were not tested. More details on the
study can be found at the Center for Science in the Public Interest's
Web site, www.cspinet.org.</TE>
<TE>   The study of a dozen starchy food products showed that McDonald's
Corp. French fries have 72 micrograms of acrylamide per serving, 300
times the amount allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency for a
single glass of water. (The EPA is the only U.S. agency that
regulates acrylamide and then only in water.) Ore-Ida frozen French
fries had 28 micrograms when baked and Fritos corn chips 11
micrograms.</TE>
<TE>   However, what effect these levels of acrylamide have on human
health is unknown, and therefore any warnings would be premature,
said Timothy Willard of the National Food Processors Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Snack food companies said tests should be done on a much wider
range of foods. "Acrylamide has been found in a lot of other foods
and beverages," said Lynn Markley of Frito-Lay Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Cooking many types of food at high temperatures can create
carcinogens, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Most manufacturers, including Frito-Lay and H.J. Heinz Co., said
they would wait for directives from the World Health Organization
before they take any action.</TE>
<TE>   Executives with McDonald's declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The center has begun to use the discovery to further its nutrition
mission, urging consumers to cut back on starchy snacks.</TE>

<HD>Buy.com Starts Price War With Amazon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Humbled mightily by the tech downturn, the once highflying retailer
Buy.com is attempting a comeback.</LD>
<LD>   The company, the fourth-largest online retailer before its stock
price plummeted to pocket change, announced Tuesday it plans to
challenge Amazon.com Inc. by undercutting the industry giant's book
prices by 10%.</LD>
<LD>   "We are gunning for them," said Buy.com's chief operating officer,
Brent Rusick.</LD>
<TE>   Buy.com had announced it would not charge shipping fees for small
items, such as books.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon officials said they had no immediate plans to match the
prices. "We focus on the customer, not the competition," said Amazon
spokeswoman Patti Smith. "Price, selection and convenience is what we
offer--price is just one factor."</TE>
<TE>   The Amazon site gets 30.9 million visitors a month, according to
ComScore Media Metrix ratings. Buy.com gets 2.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Jeetil Patel of Deutsche Bank Securities said he was wary
of an online company that offers deep discounts. "The years 1999 to
2000 are littered with bankruptcies of companies that sold just
above, just below or at cost," Patel said. "It's not sustainable."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, drastic price cuts played a role in the decline of
Buy.com, which in 2000 billed itself as having the "lowest prices on
Earth." When the company later raised prices to help cover operating
expenses, customers were alienated.</TE>
<TE>   Buy.com President Robert Price said that this time around,
discounts can be sustained because of the company's streamlined
operation. With about 650 employees at its height in 2000, the
company now has 100.</TE>
<TE>   It once was housed in a 50,000-square-foot building. "It was a
Class-A facility, but after we lost people [to layoffs] it got
uncomfortable," Price said. "It was like being at a party where the
room was too big." The new facility is about 20,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Patel said that even if Buy.com's discounts can be sustained,
Amazon's strong brand and customer service record might shield it
from major effect.</TE>
<TE>   "There is always a risk factor out there," Patel said, "but we
have to see how well Buy.com does in terms of fulfillment, the
customer experience."</TE>
<TE>   On a down day for Wall Street overall, Amazon.com shares sank
$2.17, or 12%, to $15.34 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Buy.com, which went private in 2001 after declining to such dire
straits that it almost lost its ability to process credit card sales,
has a history of customer service problems.</TE>
<TE>   Executives said those problems have been greatly curbed, but
Tuesday there were already some snags with the new pricing policy.
Although the discounts were supposed to be in effect on the site
immediately, numerous titles were still priced at or above the
Amazon.com price.</TE>
<TE>   Price said it would take at least a few more days to adjust the
pricing of all titles. In the meantime, he said buyers had 72 hours
after a purchase to request a refund to put the price in line with
the new policy.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that Buy.com, now a private company, does not have to
worry about anymore is keeping stockholders happy. But the company,
bought at 17 cents a share by founder Scott Blum in November, retains
the sophisticated technology infrastructure and other facilities that
the stockholder investment funded.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no plan to do that, it just worked out that way. It's
just a blessing," said Blum, who paid $23.6 million for Buy.com.</TE>
<TE>   Also with private company status comes confidentiality. Blum said
he expects Buy.com's revenue to be about $400 million this year. But
apart from the Internal Revenue Service, he does not have to disclose
the results. "The only reason to go public is to raise money to grow
the business," Blum said.</TE>

<HD>John Denver's Family, U.S. in a Tax Dispute</HD>
<DH>Courts: His children deny that the value of the late
singer's estate was understated and about $1.5 million is owed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In life, the value of John Denver's work was argued by critics and
fans.</LD>
<LD>   Now, in death, his family and the Internal Revenue Service are
debating it.</LD>
<LD>   According to U.S. Tax Court documents, government officials said
the value of Denver's $19-million estate was understated to the tune
of $2.5 million. That translates to about $1.5 million in back taxes
owed.</LD>
<TE>   The principal disagreement involves the value of Denver's record
label, Windstar Records, as well as Windstar Productions, a company
that handled Denver's business and management affairs before he died
Oct. 12, 1997, when an experimental plane he was piloting crashed
into Monterey Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS contends the companies were worth about twice what
Denver's estate values them at, with the agency estimating Windstar
Productions' worth at about $4.6 million and his record label at
about $893,000.</TE>
<TE>   Windstar Records does not include the valuable catalog of original
hits Denver recorded during the 1970s when he was briefly the
industry's top-selling recording artist.</TE>
<TE>   Denver's hits included "Rocky Mountain High," "Thank God I'm a
Country Boy," "Sunshine on My Shoulder," "Annie's Song" and the
Peter, Paul and Mary hit "Leaving on a Jet Plane."</TE>
<TE>   That catalog still is owned by RCA Records, where Denver recorded
for 20 years before being dropped in 1987 when his sales lagged.
Nonetheless, Denver remains one of RCA's best-selling catalog
artists, a spokeswoman for the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Denver, who was born Henry J. Deutschendorf Jr., was frequently
the target of barbs by critics who called his music too hokey. During
the late 1970s, Denver also had a fledgling acting career, starring
in such films as "Oh, God!" and was one of the most prominent
entertainers in the environmental movement.</TE>
<TE>   A tax appeal was filed by Denver's two adult children, Zachary and
Anna Deutschendorf. The two also are disputing an IRS ruling denying
nearly $2 million in deductions.</TE>
<TE>   No date has been set for a trial, but earlier this month court
officials decided it would be held in Denver. John DeBruyn, who
represents the estate, declined to comment on behalf of Denver's
children.</TE>
<TE>   An IRS spokesman also declined to comment, citing agency policy
barring comment on individual tax disputes.</TE>

<LD>   Under its new promotion, the year-old theme park is offering adult
admissions at the children's price of $35 through Sept. 3 for
Southern California residents.</LD>
<LD>   Children ages 3 to 9 accompanied by a paying adult get in free.</LD>
<TE>   The promotion by California Adventure comes as one of its major
competitors, Universal Studios Hollywood, also offers a major summer
promotion, reflecting continued weakness for theme parks from
out-of-town travelers, analysts said.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Confidence Shows Big Decline in June Survey</HD>
<DH>Economy: Mood hurt by accounting scandals, job worries.
Sales of existing homes dip but remain above expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumer confidence posted its largest one-month drop in June since
just after Sept. 11 as a weak labor market, plunging stocks and
eroding confidence in corporate America took a toll on the relatively
positive mood of Americans, a report said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   But responses to surveys and actual behavior often differ, and
other figures suggest consumers continue to buttress the economy's
sluggish recovery with hearty spending on big-ticket items such as
homes and autos.</LD>
<LD>   Figures out Tuesday on weekly chain-store sales, for instance,
showed shoppers had returned in force this month after a
weather-imposed pullback in May.</LD>
<TE>   And although consumers might not be feeling so chipper, that had
not stopped them from buying new homes. Indeed, disillusion with
equities was making housing seem an ever-more-attractive investment
option.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of existing homes dipped slightly to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 5.75 million units in May from 5.77 million in April,
but that was still comfortably above analysts' expectations and the
fourth-fastest pace on record.</TE>
<TE>   "People wouldn't be buying so many homes if they were fearful of
their financial future," said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at Bank
of Montreal/Harris Bank in Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board, a private research group, said its closely
watched index of consumer confidence fell to 106.4 in June from an
upwardly revised 110.3 in May, in line with analysts' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the dip the index remains well above the 7 1/2-year low of
84.9 hit last November and at higher levels than seen in the early
stages of recovery after the 1990-91 recession.</TE>
<TE>   To analysts that indicates consumer spending should stay solid, a
crucial factor given consumption accounts for two-thirds of U.S.
economic activity.</TE>
<TE>   The stumble in confidence came as little surprise to financial
markets, which had been tipped off by a steep slide in the University
of Michigan's preliminary June survey of consumers earlier in the
month.</TE>
<TE>   Many were relieved the drop in the conference measure was not
bigger and that gave stocks a brief boost while depressing
Treasuries.</TE>
<TE>   James O'Sullivan, an economist with UBS Warburg in Stamford,
Conn., said it was the dire performance of stocks that was weighing
on consumer sentiment in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Major indexes have declined in each of the last five weeks, with
the broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index losing about 9% during that
period.</TE>
<TE>   But it seemed consumers as a whole were not as vulnerable to
declining equity valuations as Wall Street liked to think.</TE>
<TE>   "While the stock market is retesting the lows of last fall the
confidence index is much higher," O'Sullivan said.</TE>
<TE>   "The broader point is that the economic numbers are looking more
upbeat than the stock market--the market is suggesting a double dip
in the economy, the data is not," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Americans said they had the hardest time finding new jobs in six
years, with the number of people saying jobs were "hard to get"
increasing to 23.1% from 21.8% in May. Analysts said that rise
pointed to little improvement in the jobless rate, currently at 5.8%.</TE>

<HD>Eisners Sue N.Y. Tax Consultants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These are definitely taxing times for Michael Eisner.</LD>
<LD>   Not only is Walt Disney Co. chief executive battling a lagging
performance by its ABC network and a lethargic stock price, but he
and his wife, Jane, have another headache: The couple is suing a New
York money management firm for more than $3 million for allegedly
botching the couple's California state income tax returns.</LD>
<LD>   According to a lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, the Eisners allege New York-based Executive Monetary
Management and its co-founder, Michael Stein, failed to properly
advise them on their state tax returns from 1996 through 1999,
resulting in an audit that led to more than $3 million in back taxes
and interest.</LD>
<TE>   The Eisners allege the company made mistakes in handling the
couple's state tax returns, admitting it was unaware of the
differences between federal and state laws on how to treat the
contribution of appreciated stock to private foundations.</TE>
<TE>   Wealthy executives frequently establish and donate appreciated
stock to private foundations both as a way to accomplish charitable
goals and as a strategy to minimize taxes.</TE>
<TE>   In early 1987, for example, the Eisners donated 1 million shares
of Disney stock worth $89 million to their family foundation. Recent
contributions by the foundation include $7 million to Cal State
Northridge, which is renaming its education school after Eisner.</TE>
<TE>   In the lawsuit, the Eisners said they first learned they were
being audited by the state Franchise Tax Board in April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The couple allege that Executive Monetary Management responded to
a notice by admitting to the tax board that it made an error, saying
it was because they are tax professionals based in New York and were
not aware of the California law.</TE>
<TE>   Although filed, the lawsuit has yet to be served, a legal maneuver
often used when trying to force the settlement of a dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Executive Monetary Management manages assets and provides
accounting services for wealthy executives, including a number of
entertainment industry clients. The company is a subsidiary of the
prominent money management firm Neuberger Berman.</TE>
<TE>   Executives from the company did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner declined to comment through a company spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the $3-million hit, the Eisners aren't exactly hurting.</TE>
<TE>   According to last fall's Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans,
Eisner is worth an estimated $720 million.</TE>

<HD>Ford to Probe Safety of Its Police Cars</HD>
<DH>Autos: Panels will review the design of the Crown
Victoria's gas tank after fatal crashes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEARBORN, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday that it will set up two panels to
investigate the version of the Crown Victoria sedan it produces as a
police car after a number of fatal accidents in which the vehicle's
gas tank caught fire.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona Atty. Gen. Janet Napolitano met with Ford Vice President
for Environmental and Safety Engineering Sue Cischke and other
executives to press for action in the wake of the deaths of three
Arizona policemen in four years. All died when the gas tanks on their
Crown Victorias exploded after being hit from the rear.</LD>
<LD>   Ford pledged to undertake detailed crash testing of the cars,
known as Crown Victoria Police Interceptors, and consider measures
such as adding metal shields to protect the gas tank, or using
heavy-duty "bladders" inside the gas tanks to prevent fuel leaks.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we have a concrete step forward ... so long as Ford is
treating this as their No. 1 priority," Napolitano told reporters
outside Ford's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   There was no talk in the meeting of recalling the Crown Victoria,
or of compensation to the families of at least 10 police officers who
have died in similar accidents around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Ford also is not considering fixes to the civilian version of the
Crown Victoria, its sister vehicle the Mercury Grand Marquis, or the
Lincoln Town Car, all of which share a similar platform in which the
gas tank is located behind the rear axle, which critics say is
unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   Police cruisers are put in different situations than civilian
sedans, such as being parked alongside freeways where such crashes
tend to occur, Cischke said in an appearance with Napolitano.</TE>
<TE>   Ford will set up a task force of technical experts from various
industries and the military to examine engineering solutions to
prevent similar fires. It also will participate in a blue-ribbon
panel of nine members to be named by Ford and by the Arizona attorney
general's office to consider factors such as parking positions and
lighting conditions.</TE>
<TE>   David Perry, a Texas attorney who has represented five victims of
Crown Victoria police car fires, said the cars should be recalled and
that investigative panels are a delaying tactic that puts law
enforcement workers at risk.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no need to delay making a commitment to fix the cars in
order to do research," Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an
investigation into the police Interceptors in November. NHTSA will
not comment on the probe because it is still ongoing, but confirms it
sent an investigator to Arizona this week.</TE>

<HD>State's Housing Markets in a 'Bubble,' Report Finds</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Values may drop as prices exceed incomes,
consultant says. Other analysts disagree. San Diego tops list.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Housing prices have outstripped incomes by such a wide margin in much
of California and some cities in other states that home values in
those markets could stagnate or suffer a sharp decline, according to
a controversial report that will be released today.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast to the widely held perception that the flourishing
national market has yet to overheat, the report is among the first to
declare a so-called housing bubble in some regions. The research
provoked strong disagreement from other analysts.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego's housing market has developed into a major bubble, the
report says, whereas San Francisco, San Jose, Orange County, Oakland,
Sacramento and Los Angeles have smaller ones, according to John
Burns, an Irvine consultant to the real estate industry. Boston has
the biggest market bubble in the country, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Burns, who conducted the research to estimate market risks for
builders, said home prices have reached near record highs in relation
to income in California's top markets, including San Diego and San
Francisco. Still, he said, those bubbles are only half as big as they
were at the peaks of previous market cycles.</TE>
<TE>   Prices could continue to rise for several more years, he said, but
eventually they will stagnate or decline until incomes catch up.</TE>
<TE>   Burns compared historic and current mortgage rates and home prices
with household incomes and concluded that 17 of the 44 U.S. cities he
studied demonstrate bubble conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts disputed Burns' conclusions that there are bubbles,
while agreeing that some markets cannot sustain their heated pace
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think the analysis is simplistic," said James Pugash,
chairman of Hearthstone, one of the largest providers of capital to
the homebuilding industry.</TE>
<TE>   The report overlooked supply and demand factors that could have
led to different conclusions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co., said that the
most relevant questions for the future of housing are whether the
economy will create more jobs and whether interest rates will move
up.</TE>
<TE>   Sohn, who doesn't believe mortgage rates will rise significantly
this year, said borrowing costs and home prices remain balanced.</TE>
<TE>   Burns acknowledged that employment growth, strong luxury- and
second-home sales, and other factors could cause home prices to rise
for several years. Bubbles will burst, Burns said, when there are
more home sellers than home buyers. That could occur when prices rise
to such levels that residents and employers are forced out of the
area.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said that even if they conceded that parts of
Southern California were in a small bubble, the risk to the region's
economy probably is insignificant unless prices increase 20% or more
over the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   Such a sharp rise would put prices far ahead of incomes, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   From that point the market would rise at a much lower rate but
still trend upward, they said, citing the dearth of housing in
Southern California and expected population growth.</TE>
<TE>   "What is most likely to happen in Southern California is that
prices will peak," said Ingo Winzer, editor of Local Market Monitor,
a newsletter that studies housing cycles.</TE>

<HD>KB Home Reports 62% Rise in Quarterly Profit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home builder KB Home on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected 62%
increase in fiscal second-quarter earnings as demand for homes
strengthened and selling prices rose.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based KB also raised its full-year earnings outlook,
citing the favorable housing market, particularly in California, and
improved operating efficiencies.</LD>
<LD>   "They delivered more homes than we expected [and] margins
continued to expand," said David Weaver, home builder analyst for
Legg Mason. "Overall, continued pricing power in most of their
markets and low rates are going to help keep the housing markets,
particularly for KB, very strong."</LD>
<TE>   KB posted earnings of $64.1 million, or $1.42 a share, for the
quarter ended May 31, well above the $1.11 average estimate of
analysts polled by Thomson First Call and up from $39.5 million, or
$1.07, a year earlier. Revenue grew 7% to $1.14 billion.</TE>
<TE>   For fiscal year 2002, KB lifted its profit target to $6.50 a share
from a previous range of $6.10 to $6.25. Analysts had forecast $6.01,
according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a growth market that's driven by demographics and aging
housing stock, and we consider ourselves to be focused on the best
market niches, which is first-time and first-move-up buyers," Chief
Financial Officer Dom Cecere said.</TE>
<TE>   Backlog, or homes ordered whose sales have not yet closed, was up
8% to $2.64 billion at the end of the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   KB Home shares fell $2.14 to $50.49 on the Big Board. Analysts
attributed the sell-off to news of a drop in consumer confidence in
June.</TE>

<HD>Judge Clears Music Royalties Settlement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles judge Tuesday approved a $4.75-million settlement of a
class-action royalties suit led by late singer Peggy Lee, despite
eleventh-hour objections by actor Larry Hagman.</LD>
<LD>   Lee had accused Decca Records, now a unit of Vivendi Universal, of
underpaying royalties to her and hundreds of other artists for four
decades. About 160 artists--most of whom are dead--were part of the
class action, including Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong, Billie
Holiday, Patsy Cline, Ella Fitzgerald and Bill Haley.</LD>
<LD>   Tentative settlement of the two-year-long court case was reached
in January, just days before Lee's death at the age of 81.</LD>
<TE>   But Hagman, executor of the estate of his mother, Mary Martin,
best known for her roles in the Broadway musicals "South Pacific" and
"The Sound of Music," objected last month saying the figure was too
low and unfair to some artists.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Victoria Chaney ruled,
however, that the settlement was fair because it followed extensive

<HD>Manufacturers Seek Cut in State Sales Tax</HD>
<DH>Economy: The proposed 5-percentage-point reduction would
create 50,000 new jobs a year over the next decade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California manufacturers are lobbying for a tax break they say would
bolster the state's sagging industrial sector and create 50,000 new
jobs annually over the next decade.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn.
unveiled a proposal for a 5-percentage-point reduction in the state
sales tax on purchases of manufacturing and telecommunications
equipment. The move would cost the state treasury an estimated $185
million in the first year--a tough sell at a time when California is
facing a nearly $24-billion budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   But business leaders say increased economic activity would more
than offset the initial cost within a few years, resulting in a net
revenue gain to state coffers and a much-needed lift to the state's
industrial base.</LD>
<TE>   "This proposal will help turn around California's economy while
providing a strong base for sustained economic growth and job
creation," said Jack Stewart, president of the association.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing isn't the only sector lining up for tax relief in
the midst of a budget crisis. The software industry is on the verge
of receiving a long-sought $30-million tax break, and Gov. Gray Davis
earlier this year blocked efforts to impose a $22-million tax on the
lumber industry.</TE>
<TE>   Such breaks already have some legislators seething at a time when
they're being forced to cut social programs to balance the books. But
Stewart said the state's hard-hit manufacturing sector deserves
assistance. California has lost more than 145,000 factory jobs since
January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The big concern is that many of those jobs won't come back, given
California's high cost of doing business.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturers group commissioned a study by the Santa
Monica-based Milken Institute showing that, among major manufacturing
states, only Minnesota has a higher tax burden than California. Add
the nation's highest electricity rates and industrial space costs
that are 40% above the national average, and "you've got the
perception that California is a business-unfriendly state," said
Milken economist Ross DeVol, who wrote the manufacturing study.</TE>
<TE>   DeVol said reducing the sales tax would give California
manufacturers an incentive to purchase more capital equipment, which
would provide an immediate stimulus to the economy.</TE>
<TE>   He projects the break would result in 50,000 new jobs a
year--14,000 of them in manufacturing--resulting in a net revenue
gain of $114 million over a five-year period.</TE>

<HD>Stock Indexes Fall Near Lows of Sept.</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Sell-off includes some of year's best
performers, raises fear of broader slide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO and DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street suffered another mauling Tuesday, sending key stock
indexes to within a hair's breadth of their September lows and
threatening to open a new phase of the long bear market.</LD>
<LD>   What's more, a stunning report after markets closed--that telecom
giant WorldCom Group's accounting was skewed by huge
irregularities--could further dash investors' confidence in corporate
America and trigger heavy stock selling today, analysts warned.</LD>
<LD>   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index Tuesday plunged
36.35 points, or 2.5%, to 1,423.99. The close left it less than a
point above the three-year closing low of 1,423.19 set Sept. 21 in
the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 16.58 points Tuesday to
end at 976.14, less than 11 points above its Sept. 21 low.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow industrial average, though still well above its September
low, sank 155 points, or 1.7%, to 9,126.82.</TE>
<TE>   The market's latest slide deepened what already are heavy losses
this year for many investors, especially those who have hung on to
the technology stars of the late 1990s. The Nasdaq index is down 27%
since Dec. 31, after falling 39% in 2000 and 21% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Computer chip leader Intel dropped $1.01 to $18.32 on Tuesday;
Yahoo fell $1.36 to $13.72 and IBM slid $1.10 to $68.60.</TE>
<TE>   More troubling was that the sell-off Tuesday included some of the
stocks that have performed best over the last year--suggesting that
investors are growing increasingly nervous even about shares that
have bucked the continued downtrend in tech.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's losers were Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, down $3.40 to
$30.50; defense giant General Dynamics, down $4.88 to $103.13; auto
parts retailer AutoZone, which slid $3.12 to $78.23; and tobacco and
food titan Philip Morris, down $2.25 to $46.55.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street drew little cheer from an upbeat report from chemical
company DuPont, which said its second-quarter earnings could be as
much as 20% above analysts' estimates. DuPont shares rose as high as
$44.55 but fell back to close with a 13-cent gain at $43.24.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, losers topped winners by 9 to 7 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 21 to 13 on Nasdaq, in heavy trading.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, what this is saying is people are scared," said Robert
Christian, chief investment officer for Wilmington Trust in
Wilmington, Del.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board said Tuesday that its index of consumer
confidence fell sharply in June, dragged down partly by the stock
market's losses since mid-May. But many analysts said the economic
recovery remains on track, and that what ails Wall Street has little
to do with economic issues.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big disconnect between what's happening in the economy
and what's happening with the market," said Art Hogan, chief market
analyst at brokerage Jefferies &amp; Co. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors, he said, may be paying little attention to the
economic news because of the barrage of corporate scandals and
terrorism warnings, and the threat of a wider Mideast conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what happens with the economy, until we stop worrying
about 'event risk,' investors are saying they don't want to get back
in this game," Hogan said. "There's such a great lack of confidence"
in stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Another slide in the dollar's value against the euro could trigger
more selling of U.S. stocks by European investors, whose American
investments are losing value with each drop in the dollar. The euro
rose to 97.8 cents Tuesday from 97.1 cents Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Some market pros said the selling Tuesday in such recent investor
favorites as Krispy Kreme and AutoZone could be a sign that the
market's latest decline has nearly run its course.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of a down-wave they tend to sell the better-performing
stocks," said Kevin Marder, market strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann
Asset Management.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Nasdaq index and the S&amp;P 500 close below their Sept. 21
lows it could be another blow to fragile investor psychology, and
will refire the debate over whether the bear market that began in
March 2000 ended in September or has continued.</TE>
<TE>   If the slide since March 2000 is viewed as continuous, it would
now be 27 months old--the longest bear market since the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts, however, said the powerful market rebound in the
fourth quarter constituted a new bull market, because the S&amp;P 500
index rose more than 21% between Sept. 21 and early January.</TE>
<TE>   But for investors who have held on to stocks for the last few
years, whether this is a new bear market or the same old one may be a
moot point. The net effect is the same: more red ink in stock
portfolios.</TE>

<HD>Stewart Inquiry Said Widened</HD>
<DH>Securities: Shares of her firm have fallen 34% since
insider-trading probe was revealed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Martha Stewart may be facing a wider probe of her sale of ImClone
Systems Inc. shares, including possible charges of obstruction of
justice and making false statements.</LD>
<LD>   In a story posted on its Web site late Tuesday, The Wall Street
Journal, citing an unnamed source familiar with the case, said
federal prosecutors had widened their investigation to determine
whether Stewart had misled prosecutors in divulging details about her
sale of ImClone Systems stock.</LD>
<LD>   Congressional investigators are examining whether Stewart had
inside information when she sold nearly 4,000 shares of the biotech
company in December a day before the Food and Drug Administration
announced that it had decided not to consider ImClone's experimental
drug for combating colorectal cancer, Erbitux.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart, who commands a multimedia empire and a profitable
corporation, increasingly is under the glare of government scrutiny
and tabloid attention -- bringing investor displeasure.</TE>
<TE>   In her weekly appearance on CBS' "The Early Show," an exasperated
Martha Stewart told television viewers she hoped her entanglement in
an insider trading scandal would be resolved soon and she would "be
exonerated of any ridiculousness."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart chopped cabbage while Early Show host Jane Clayson pressed
her to comment on the news that her stockbroker, Peter Bacanovic, had
been suspended by Merrill Lynch and asked whether that complicated
matters for her.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just not at liberty at this time to make any comments
whatsoever," she told Clayson. "I certainly hope that the matter is
resolved in the very near future."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the stock sale.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Martha Stewart Living have tumbled 34% since June 6,
when reports of her ImClone trading surfaced. The stock rose Tuesday,
gaining $1.05 to close at $13.60 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of a House subcommittee
that investigating the ImClone matter, told CNN that his panel hoped
to draw conclusions about Stewart's stock sale "within another week
or so."</TE>

<HD>8 N.Y. Modeling Firms Accused of Price Fixing</HD>
<DH>Courts: Six models who live in California sue the top
agencies, saying they have conspired to control pay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight top modeling agencies were accused in a class-action lawsuit
Tuesday of violating federal antitrust laws since the 1970s by fixing
the fees they charge models for finding them work.</LD>
<LD>   California models Amanda Masters, Justin Klentner, Carolyn Fears,
Lorelei Shellist, Barbara Cheeseborough and Carla Gross allege in the
lawsuit that Elite Models Inc., Ford Models Inc., Wilhemina Model
Agency Inc. and five other New York-based agencies formed an
association in the 1970s and held monthly meetings to keep each
other--and smaller competitors--from underpricing each other.</LD>
<LD>   The eight agencies, who together control the lion's share of the
modeling market, currently charge models 20% of their pay per
job--10% more than employment agencies are allowed to charge under
New York law, lawyers for the models said. In addition to the fees
from models, agencies also charge the employers who hire them 20%,
the lawyers said.</LD>
<TE>   Katie Ford, chief executive of Ford Models, said she hadn't seen
the suit and denied the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been absolutely no price-fixing in the industry," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the alleged conspiracy involves an agreement in the 1970s
to describe themselves as managers instead of employment agents to
circumvent the New York law, the lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you procure employment, you are an agent," said Brian
Rishwain, a Los Angeles lawyer representing the models. "They charge
100% more than they are allowed to in New York, and, in order to
maintain that, they've all gotten together and colluded to set a
price."</TE>
<TE>   The models who filed the suit are "representative of the 95% of
models who are out there--the non-supermodel who can't negotiate
[like] the big players can," Rishwain said. "They are not Christy
Turlingtons."</TE>
<TE>   Models sign such disadvantageous contracts with agencies because
they typically start out young, are not well represented and fear
getting blackballed from the business, said Andrew Hayes, a New York
lawyer for the models who is a partner in the law firm of David
Boies.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way models can get jobs is to be listed with a modeling
agency," Hayes said.</TE>
<TE>   The relatively few models who do attain supermodel status hire
managers and lawyers who recognize the unfairness of the contracts
and negotiate their clients out of them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Klentner, who quit modeling a few years ago after a career in
major print campaigns including Calvin Klein and Versace, said
industry practices are stacked against the talent. He said the Screen
Actors Guild represents its members for a 10% fee and offers a
pension and health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "I modeled for 15 years and I'm not vested for any kind of pension
or anything," Klentner said.</TE>
<TE>   If the lawsuit succeeds in obtaining class-action status, it could
result in damages awarded to thousands of current and former models
who have worked for the agencies since the alleged conspiracy began.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes said the lawsuit is unprecedented but is similar to
litigation brought by his firm against auction houses Sothebys and
Christies, which were convicted in 2000 of price fixing. Usually,
lawsuits by injured parties follow criminal prosecutions in antitrust
cases, as has happened with the auction houses, which have faced
claims from customers in the wake of the conviction.</TE>
<TE>   But it also can work the other way, said Tom Campbell, an
antitrust law professor at Stanford University. If the models prove
their case, the lawsuit could lead to prosecution under criminal
antitrust laws.</TE>

<HD>Companies Win IRS Delay of Payroll Tax on Stock Options</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Public companies that offer some types of stock-based incentives to
their rank-and-file workers won a temporary victory Tuesday when the
Internal Revenue Service said it would indefinitely postpone
assessing employment taxes on these benefits.</LD>
<LD>   Employer groups, widely applauding the move, said the IRS decision
gives them a chance to push a bill through Congress that could make
these stock benefits forever free of employment taxes--the 15.3% of
wages that goes to Social Security and Medicare programs.</LD>
<LD>   And that could be a victory for the 15 million workers who were
expected to bear the brunt of the proposed tax, which was expected to
raise $23 billion over the next 10 years.</LD>
<TE>   "This is very good news," said James Delaplane, vice president of
retirement policy at the American Benefits Council in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS decision affects employee stock-purchase plans, which give
workers the right to buy their employers' shares at a discount. The
discounts commonly amount to 15% of the market price of the stock. It
also affects certain types of employee stock options.</TE>
<TE>   Workers have never paid employment taxes on the gains derived from
these discounted stock purchases. But the IRS determined a year ago
that this was a mistake and warned companies that it expected to
start taxing the benefits in January 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But employers including Microsoft Corp. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
objected to the proposed rule, saying it was unjust and impossible to
administer. Lower- and middle-income workers would bear a
disproportionate share of the tax burden, the companies said, because
the bulk of employment taxes--the 12.4% of income that goes to Social
Security--is imposed on wages only up to set caps. The cap, which is
adjusted for inflation each year, is currently $84,900.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, workers pay employment taxes on the dollars that they
use to buy the shares and pay capital gains taxes on their profit
when they actually sell the shares. Trying to impose employment taxes
on the value of the discounts would both double-tax some dollars and
create nightmarish bookkeeping for companies providing the plans,
said Caroline Graves Hurley, director of tax policy at AeA, a
Washington-based trade group representing electronics and technology
companies.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS received more than 100 comments about the proposed
rule--all of them arguing against the tax, government officials said.
The IRS indefinitely postponed its plans while it reviews the
comments, which came from individuals, multinational corporations and
trade groups. In addition, the agency said that if it eventually
revives plans to tax the benefits, it would give companies at least
two years' warning, pushing back the threat to late 2004 or early
2005.</TE>
<TE>   "There was not one comment that said we should do this," said a
Treasury Department official, who asked not to be named. "That's why
you have to go back and look very closely to make sure you are doing
the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   About 15 million Americans are offered employee stock-purchase
plans at work and an additional 8 million to 10 million receive some
type of stock option, according to the American Benefits Council.
These plans allow workers to buy their company's shares through
payroll withholding at a slight discount to the market price.
However, the value of the discount can be difficult to calculate,
partly because of the day-to-day swings in stock market prices.</TE>
<TE>   "The tax is potentially unfair and enormously complicated," said
Corey Rosen, director of the National Center for Employee Ownership.
"It would have been a nightmare to figure out how to do this."</TE>
<TE>   The House has passed a bill that would permanently ban these
benefits from being subjected to employment taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The bill has stalled in the Senate, but several senators have said
they may take up the issue in separate legislation.</TE>

<HD>Banker Settles Probe of Threats</HD>
<DH>Securities: U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and worker will pay
$300,000, ending an investigation of possible retaliatory acts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and one of its investment bankers agreed
Tuesday to pay $300,000 to settle an investigation into whether the
firm dropped analyst coverage of a small biotechnology firm to
retaliate for the loss of investment-banking work.</LD>
<LD>   The payment ends a probe by the National Assn. of Securities
Dealers, the industry group that regulates brokerage firms, into
whether the firm ceased coverage of Antigenics Inc. to punish the New
York company for hiring a Piper rival to handle a $60-million stock
offering in January.</LD>
<LD>   The NASD found that investment banker Scott Beardsley, after being
told by Antigenics that it had chosen UBS Warburg as its so-called
lead underwriter, threatened to discontinue analyst coverage unless
Piper was given the business. Antigenics stuck with UBS Warburg and
Piper stopped following the stock shortly thereafter. At the time,
Piper rated Antigenics a "strong buy."</LD>
<TE>   Under terms of the settlement, Piper was fined $250,000 and
Beardsley was fined $50,000. Beardsley and the firm neither admitted
nor denied the NASD's allegation that they violated the
organization's rule requiring "just and equitable" business
practices.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a substantial fine, indicative of the significance of the
conduct," said Barry Goldsmith, NASD executive vice president of
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Piper said in a statement that the settlement was in "the best
interests of our clients and our business." A spokeswoman declined
further comment.</TE>
<TE>   The case demonstrates how closely intertwined investment banking
and stock research are at many firms, despite the intensive efforts
of securities regulators to separate the two.</TE>
<TE>   Amid a furor over analysts' perceived lack of objectivity,
regulators have proposed new rules designed to ensure analyst
independence. Critics say analysts sometimes twist their
recommendations to help their firms win lucrative investment-banking
work.</TE>
<TE>   That is normally done by praising the stocks of investment-banking
clients. The Piper case is a new twist in that the removal of analyst
coverage allegedly was used to threaten a wayward client.</TE>
<TE>   Piper handled Antigenics' initial public offering in early 2000
and may have believed its analyst's coverage assured it dibs on the
company's future investment-banking business, said John Coffee, a
Columbia University law professor. The elimination of coverage also
suggests that stock research at some firms is used as little more
than a bargaining chip in the quest for investment-banking fees.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst coverage is crucial for small companies such as
Antigenics, developer of a promising cancer drug. Kind words from
analysts help small companies win attention from mutual funds and
other institutional investors. Conversely, abruptly ending coverage,
especially by the brokerage that handled an IPO, can be interpreted
by investors as a red flag.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, companies are reluctant to publicly confront investment
banks. But Garo Armen, Antigenics' chief executive, said Tuesday that
he was incensed and complained to regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "I got plenty of advice not to do this," Armen said. "They said
'You've got nothing to win, but possibly things to lose.' But it's
like witnessing a crime and not being willing to testify."</TE>
<TE>   According to the NASD, Antigenics told Beardsley on Dec. 27 it had
chosen UBS Warburg to head the underwriting.</TE>
<TE>   Beardsley told Armen that Piper would drop coverage unless Piper
was named lead manager, the NASD said.</TE>
<TE>   Antigenics announced Jan. 2 that UBS Warburg would lead the
offering. Two days later, Piper dropped coverage of Antigenics. The
biotech company's stock has fallen more than 40% since then. It
closed Tuesday at $9.50, down 20 cents, in Nasdaq trading.</TE>

<HD>Coast Guard Revamp</HD>
<DH>Northrop, Lockheed get contract worth up to $17 billion</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp. on Tuesday won the
Coast Guard's largest-ever contract--worth a potential $17 billion
over 30 years--to replace and upgrade aging ships, aircraft and
communication systems.</LD>
<LD>   The fiercely contested contract, considered big even by today's
defense industry standards, calls for Northrop and Lockheed to help
modernize a service that operates a fleet of ships and planes that is
among the oldest in the world.</LD>
<LD>   The program calls for the construction of 91 ships, 35 airplanes,
34 helicopters and 76 unmanned surveillance planes as well as the
upgrading of 49 cutters and 93 helicopters. The ships and aircraft
would be used to patrol the seas more than 50 miles offshore, hence
its name, Operation Deepwater.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a tremendous win," Northrop President Ronald Sugar said
Tuesday. "We're essentially recapitalizing one of the largest navies
in the world."</TE>
<TE>   While a significant boon to the Northrop-Lockheed team, the
contract also represents a major milestone for the Coast Guard.</TE>
<TE>   The service has been struggling to meet its multifaceted mission
that includes stopping illegal fishing, nabbing smugglers and making
rescues at sea. And in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, the Coast Guard's role has been expanded to include the hunt
for terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Coast Guard's motto is Semper Paratus, Latin for
"always ready," the agency has had difficulty operating and
maintaining its aging fleet, which is based mostly on 1960s
technology and hull design. Most of the ships were built between 1964
and 1972--some even date to World War II. They rely on outdated radar
and communication systems.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last year with The Times, Capt. Richard Kelly, a
29-year Coast Guard veteran, described the Coast Guard's ships and
planes as essentially "blind, deaf and dumb." Its fastest cutters
have a top speed of just under 30 knots, for instance, while
speedboats used by drug smugglers zip across the water at more than
twice that speed. Additionally, coast guardsmen must rely almost
exclusively on the human eye to locate vessels in distress.</TE>
<TE>   "What a grand day for the Coast Guard," said Rear Adm. Patrick
Stillman, executive officer for the Deepwater program, as he
announced the contract winners Tuesday. "It is fundamental to
changing the capability of maritime safety needs of this nation."</TE>
<TE>   To upgrade its fleet, the Coast Guard solicited proposals from
some of the nation's largest defense contractors in a competition
that lasted four years. Eventually, the competition was narrowed to
three teams--led by Northrop-Lockheed, Boeing Co. and Science
Applications International Corp.</TE>
<TE>   But in March, the Coast Guard told Boeing and SAIC, which was
aligned with Raytheon Corp. and Manitowoc Co., that their proposals
failed to meet specifications, effectively leaving the
Northrop-Lockheed team as the lone remaining bidder for the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's announcement made clear the massive size of Operation
Deepwater. Analysts said the program would provide a much-needed
boost to the nation's few remaining shipyards and aircraft makers,
industries that had been languishing under tightened Pentagon budgets
and increased competition from foreign companies.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop said that more than 100 companies in 32 states would be
involved in the program in some way.</TE>
<TE>   The contract award was announced after the close of the stock
market. In New York Stock Exchange trading, Century City-based
Northrop closed at $124, down $4.35, and Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed
fell $1.65 to $67.85 on a day that saw most defense stocks decline.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of the contract, Northrop will design and build
the new cutters at its Pascagoula, Miss., shipyard.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed will be responsible for developing the command, control
and communication systems for the program as well as procuring the
airplanes, helicopters and unmanned aircraft. The first new ships are
scheduled to be delivered in 2006 or 2007, the Coast Guard said.</TE>
<TE>   To keep costs down, the Coast Guard wants Northrop and Lockheed to
mostly consider off-the-shelf equipment and technology in designing
the system rather than develop new ones.</TE>
<TE>   Satellite-based communications are expected to make up the
backbone of the integrated system, which eventually could include
purchasing military-type aircraft such as the new V-22 tilt-rotor
that takes off, hovers and lands like a helicopter and flies like a
fixed-wing aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The initial five-year contract is worth $290 million in the first
year and $500 million in each of the four remaining years, with
options for renewal in five-year blocks, the Coast Guard said.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the Coast Guard anticipates eventually spending $11
billion for equipment and $5.9 billion for operation, maintenance and
other related costs.</TE>

<HD>Suzuki to Get Trial on SUV Claims</HD>
<DH>Autos: Panel reopens challenge to Consumer Reports'
veracity about its test of the Samurai.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A product defamation suit by Suzuki Motor Corp. against the publisher
of Consumer Reports was revived Tuesday when a federal appellate
panel in San Francisco ruled the auto maker should get a jury trial
on its claims that the magazine rigged a driving test to show the
Suzuki Samurai sport utility vehicle was easy to roll.</LD>
<LD>   By ordering the case to trial--a decision New York-based Consumers
Union says it will oppose--the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
panel reopens a challenge to the veracity of a magazine whose test
reports are read and accepted as gospel by millions.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer Reports has resurrected its 1988 Samurai test and its
negative results in several special issues and fund-raising drives
since the initial publication. Suzuki did not sue in 1988, but filed
its claim after the magazine cited the Samurai test in a 1996 special
issue.</LD>
<TE>   George Ball, Suzuki's lead attorney in the case, said the ruling
means Consumers Union "finally will have to answer in court for the
false charges it has spread."</TE>
<TE>   Consumers Union views the suit as an attack on the freedom of the
press to comment on consumer goods. Consumers Union President Jim
Gent said the nonprofit group is considering options, including
asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the appellate decision or
seek a new hearing before the entire U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   In a similar suit brought by Isuzu Motor Corp. two years ago, a
federal jury in Los Angeles faulted Consumer Reports for publishing
false information about the 1995-96 Isuzu Trooper. But the jury said
Isuzu had not proved actual malice and rejected the car maker's
product defamation claim.</TE>
<TE>   Legal scholars say it is difficult to prove actual malice--the
intentional publishing of false information in order to harm a
reputation--in libel suits against reputable publications.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Tuesday's ruling by a divided three-judge panel
reverses a May 2000 finding by District Judge Alicemarie Stotler in
Santa Ana that Suzuki probably would not be able to prove that
Consumers Union intentionally set out to harm Suzuki's reputation and
knowingly published false information to achieve that goal.</TE>
<TE>   Negative reviews in Consumer Reports can kill a product's chances
in the market. Indeed, sales of the Samurai, which was one of the
top-selling small SUVs in the country in 1988, plummeted after the
initial Consumer Reports review that year.</TE>
<TE>   The Samurai review was the first time Consumer Reports had found a
sport utility vehicle liable to roll over and marked the beginning of
what has become a stream of criticism about SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   Safety advocates who claim the SUVs are inherently unsafe because
of their high center of gravity often cite Consumer Reports' Samurai
review in arguments.</TE>
<TE>   But the appellate panel in its 2-1 decision held that the district
court, in rejecting a trial on Suzuki's claims more than two years
ago, "did not give adequate credit to ... evidence of test-rigging"
by the magazine.</TE>
<TE>   A "reasonable jury could find by clear and convincing evidence
that [Consumers Union] sought to produce a predetermined result in
the Samurai test," the panel ruled.</TE>

<HD>Bidding Heats Up for TRW</HD>
<DH>Deals: Northrop Grumman raises offer to buy the company as
three rivals seek only its defense-related units.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. has told TRW Inc. executives it is willing to
raise its offer for the company to $58 a share, or about $7.2
billion, as three defense industry rivals proposed acquiring TRW's
space and defense electronics business, sources familiar with the
bidding process said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In its latest proposal, Northrop has apparently told TRW that the
bid--$5 more than the previous proposal of $53 a share--merely
represents a starting point for a friendly deal that could send the
figure up slightly.</LD>
<LD>   Northrop's new bid came as General Dynamics Corp., Raytheon Co.
and the U.S. unit of Britain's BAE Systems submitted their own bids
to acquire TRW's defense-related businesses, a move that was seen as
putting pressure on Northrop to increase its offer.</LD>
<TE>   Officials with the three companies, as well as Northrop, declined
to comment, citing policy against making statements related to
pending deals.</TE>
<TE>   The companies signed confidentiality agreements with TRW
prohibiting disclosure of any details.</TE>
<TE>   While the three companies only want a piece of TRW, Northrop has
been after the entire company, including TRW's debt-laden automotive
parts business.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop has said it would spin off the auto business and keep
only the defense business if it is successful.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop's latest offer comes on top of a sweetened bid that had
raised the potential value of the deal to $6.7 billion from the
initial $5.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have been anticipating the revised bid in light of TRW's
improved financial picture.</TE>
<TE>   Since Northrop made the hostile bid in February, TRW has been able
to shed its aeronautical systems business for $1.5 billion,
bolstering its cash position, and has benefited from an uptick in
defense spending. TRW sold the aircraft parts business to Goodrich
Corp. last week at a price that was at the high end of analysts'
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the possibility of a bidding war drove down defense stocks.
In New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday, Northrop shares fell
$4.35 to $124, while General Dynamics declined $4.88 to $103.13.
Shares of Raytheon, which surprised analysts with its bid, fell $2.37
to $38.58 and TRW declined 60 cents to $55.85.</TE>
<TE>   Although General Dynamics and BAE were known to be interested in
TRW's defense business, Raytheon was not considered a potential
bidder because of its weaker financial condition.</TE>

<HD>Messier's Key Ally Leaves Board</HD>
<DH>Media: Respected businessman Bernard Arnault is the fifth
Vivendi director to resign this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Already struggling to quell the tumult surrounding his company,
French media baron Jean-Marie Messier suffered yet another blow
Tuesday after his top supporter became the fifth board member to
resign this year from Vivendi Universal.</LD>
<LD>   Bernard Arnault, chairman of luxury goods maker LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton and one of France's most respected businessmen, did not
explain why he was stepping down from the company's board of
directors. But analysts speculated he and other French board members
were frustrated over some of Chief Executive Messier's recent
decisions, including conflicting statements about his plans for
Vivendi's water business.</LD>
<LD>   The departure leaves Messier's position on the company's 15-member
board more tenuous than ever, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   "Without question, his resignation will further undermine the
confidence investors and board members have in Messier's ability to
lead the company," said Mark Harrington, a media industry analyst
with J.P. Morgan Chase in London.</TE>
<TE>   Although Messier has taken steps to carry out a plan approved by
the company's board last month to reduce its debt load, he has yet to
overcome a reservoir of distrust between him and investors. The
distrust began earlier this year when the company reported the
largest loss in French history and worsened with disclosures of
unexpected liabilities and conflicting statements about whether
Vivendi would give up its controlling interest in Vivendi
Environnement, the world's largest water company.</TE>
<TE>   Messier expected to get credit this week for selling a 15.6% stake
in Vivendi's water utility to reduce debt. Instead, the timing only
heightened speculation that the company was facing a cash crunch,
which Vivendi has denied.</TE>
<TE>   It was Arnault who traditionally rallied behind Messier when
increasingly pointed criticisms were raised about his strategy. At a
meeting in New York last month, Arnault defended Messier when some
American board members reportedly questioned whether he should step
down.</TE>
<TE>   Arnault's resignation came the day after Vivendi's share price
dropped to a 13-year low in France. The share price remained stable
Tuesday, closing on the New York Stock Exchange at $19.80.</TE>
<TE>   His exit, combined with the other board departures for a variety
of reasons, leaves Messier with fewer French board members to act as
a buffer against American board members who have been his strongest
critics.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Vivendi board appointed former Universal Studios
head Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Societe Generale's Marc Vienot to monitor
Messier's stewardship of the company. Although Bronfman has supported
Messier, his family, which owns 5% of Vivendi, is reviewing its stake
in the company after seeing huge losses in its holdings this year.
Bronfman could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Messier emerged from Tuesday's meeting in Paris with the support
of the company's board, a company spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it had nominated Dominique Hoenn, a veteran
executive at French bank BNP Paribas, to replace Arnault.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi said it also was on track to meet its financial targets
for this year and would seek to reduce its debt by $3.9 billion by
the end of the year. But the company plans to begin holding
conference calls with investors twice each month "to put an end to
negative and continuous rumors about the company."</TE>
<TE>   Most investors think Messier will hold on to his job for now
because of the lack of any obvious successor and the need to maintain
stability.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is, he'll hang on," said Dennis Leibowitz, general
partner of Act 11 Partners, a hedge fund in New York that has
invested in Vivendi. "The operations are doing well. The stock is
very cheap."</TE>
<TE>   Winning back investor confidence, however, will be a formidable
challenge for Messier.</TE>
<TE>   Messier needs to continue cutting the company's $30-billion debt,
which credit-rating companies say is excessive. Vivendi amassed the
debt after Messier pushed through a series of acquisitions, including
Universal Studios and Canal Plus, to transform a water utility into a
rival of AOL Time Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Messier also needs to better communicate with the financial
community, analysts said. Many were frustrated when the company
canceled a meeting it planned with analysts last month to lay out its
strategy for the future.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs to come to investors and communicate very clearly with
regards to where he sees Vivendi in the next 12 months, to justify
the strategy and be consistent with the market," Harrington said,
noting that most investors no longer believe Messier's vision of
using the Internet and cell phones as outlets for movies, music and
games.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi investor relations head Laura Martin defended the
company's communication with investors. She said the company canceled
the analyst meeting only because it was focused on a management
overhaul at its Canal Plus TV unit. "In the context of the current
market, investors have a tendency to infer the worst," she said.</TE>
<TE>   To some extent, the company has been the victim of market forces
beyond its control. In the post-Enron climate, investors have been
more unforgiving toward large, complex companies on an aggressive
growth path.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's taken a hit," said Larry Haverty, a money manager with
State Street Research &amp; Management in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Despite problems in Canal Plus and the company's Internet
business, Vivendi still has solid assets in the Universal music,
movie and theme park businesses, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Arnault is the fifth board member to quit the board this year.</TE>
<TE>   Rene Thomas, honorary chairman of BNP Paribas, left the board this
year to retire.</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Louis Beffa, chief executive of Saint-Gobain, left in April
after Vivendi sold its interest in Saint-Gobain.</TE>
<TE>   Philippe Foriel-Destezet, a former chief executive of Adecco,
resigned in April because of a conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Pierre Lescure, head of Vivendi's pay-television unit Canal Plus,
left after he was fired in April.</TE>

<LD>A Bush nominee who played a role in easing government oversight of
energy products trading promised to prosecute any market manipulation
vigorously.</LD>
<LD>   But Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee who presided at a confirmation hearing for Walter Lukken
and another nominee as members of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, voiced misgivings about the agency's ability to prevent
market abuses.</LD>
<LD>   The other nominee, Sharon Brown-Hruska, is closely associated with
former Enron Corp. board member Wendy Gramm. Lukken, an Agriculture
Committee aide named by President Bush to the commodity futures
agency, was a primary author of the 2000 legislation, known as the
Commodity Futures Modernization Act.</LD>
<TE>   At the hearing, Lukken and Brown-Hruska promised vigilant
investigation and punishment of fraud or market manipulation.</TE>

<LD>AstraZeneca persuaded a federal judge to dismiss two antitrust
lawsuits filed by consumers who accused the drug maker of filing
patent infringement claims to block generic competition to Prilosec.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said the plaintiffs failed to prove
that AstraZeneca's suits against 10 generic-drug makers were sham
litigation designed to thwart competition to the heartburn drug.</LD>
<LD>   The antitrust lawsuits were filed last year on behalf of consumers
and union insurance plans. A federal judge has invalidated four of
six patents involved in a New York trial.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Milan Panic, the mercurial former chief executive of ICN
Pharmaceuticals, has wasted little time in opening up his latest
venture, MP Enterprises, which he said would focus on international
business and humanitarian issues.</LD>
<LD>   Panics' new offices are just blocks away from the company he
founded 42 years ago, in the Orange County Performing Arts Center
commercial and cultural complex in Costa Mesa. As chairman of ICN,
Panic initiated a $1-million pledge of support to the center.</LD>
<LD>   In describing part of the focus of his new effort, Panic said he
had recently sponsored a fact-finding mission to the U.S. for a
Serbian trade group so that it could study American agricultural
techniques.</LD>
<TE>   He said he was considering whether to underwrite the trade group's
efforts to import agricultural products to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Panic, 72, recently stepped down as chief of ICN after he lost a
brutal fight for control of the ICN board. Panic remains on the
company's board and plans to hang on to 1 million shares of ICN
stock.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FedEx Corp. said it expects fiscal first-quarter profit to fall short
of Wall Street estimates, hurt by a slow recovery in the technology
and manufacturing sectors, key drivers of air shipments.</LD>
<LD>   FedEx shares dropped 14% despite the company's report of
better-than-expected profit for the latest quarter. FedEx fell $8.02,
to $48, in active Big Board trading.</LD>
<LD>   FedEx, whose FedEx Express unit is the world's largest express
transport company, said earnings for the current quarter ending Aug.
31 should come in at 40 cents to 50 cents a share, below the mean
estimate of 54 cents from eight analysts surveyed by Thomson First
Call.</LD>
<TE>   Profit more than doubled to $236 million, or 78 cents a share, in
the fiscal fourth quarter ended May 31, from $113 million, or 38
cents, a year earlier, as revenue grew 6% to $5.42 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The results were a penny better than analysts' average estimate.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The newest version of the Toyota Camry, the nation's best-selling
car, received a low score in a closely watched U.S. government crash
test.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2002
Camry sedan two stars out of five for protecting the driver in a
side-impact crash.</LD>
<LD>   Of 86 2002 passenger car models the agency has run the same test
on, 10 others earned two or fewer stars. Among the Camry's direct
competitors, Honda Motor Co.'s Accord sedan earned four stars, and
Nissan Motor Co.'s Altima earned three stars.</LD>
<TE>   Toyota Motor Corp. said the findings were inconsistent with its
own crash-test results. The version of the Camry sedan tested by the
agency did not have an optional side air bag.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>MetLife Inc., the biggest U.S. life insurer, will pay $76 million to
settle a lawsuit brought against one of its units over Medicare
payments.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based company said its General American Life
Insurance Co. unit and the U.S. government had agreed to a civil
settlement relating to General American's Medicare contract business,
which ended in 1998, two years before MetLife acquired the company.
MetLife also agreed to stop seeking Medicare business for five years.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in St. Louis, alleged
General American knowingly provided false information to the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency responsible for
administering the Medicare program. General American acted as a
Medicare carrier for Missouri from 1965 through 1998.</LD>
<TE>   MetLife shares fell 13 cents to $28.67 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Motorola Credit Rating Cut 2 Levels by Moody's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Motorola Inc.'s credit rating was cut two levels by Moody's Investors
Service because of slack demand for communications equipment from the
second-largest mobile phone maker.</LD>
<LD>   Motorola, which posted its fifth straight losing quarter, was
lowered to two levels above junk at Baa2 with a negative outlook,
meaning the rating will probably be lowered rather than raised. The
cut follows a similar action by Standard &amp; Poor's.</LD>
<LD>   A further one-level downgrade would trigger clauses in two bank
agreements that would require Motorola to provide collateral on one
credit facility and may force repayment of a bank credit line.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola fell 14 cents to $14.28
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Napster Inc., the Internet music-swapping service that has filed for
bankruptcy protection, won final court approval to tap into a
$5.1-million credit line and spend $1.1 million to retain employees.</LD>
<LD>   The company also sought approval of bidding procedures to sell its
assets.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh said the proposed schedule
didn't provide enough time to test whether the $91-million credit
portion of Bertelsmann's bid is appropriate.</LD>
<TE>   Guetersloh, Germany-based Bertelsmann has offered to pay $9
million in cash, $1 million more than its original bid, for the
song-swapping service. It also will give it the unused portion of its
credit line and forgive $9 million in loans and advances.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roxio Inc., whose software is used for home burning of CDs, slashed
its quarterly earnings forecast by more than 80% and cut its revenue
outlook, citing weak retail sales, particularly in Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Santa Clara, Calif.-based Roxio fell to $8 in
after-hours trading after closing down 2.4% at $14.95 on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Roxio said it expects to report revenue for its fiscal first
quarter of $31 million and earnings per share, excluding noncash
charges, of 2 cents. Including charges it expects to report a
per-share loss of 15 cents.</LD>
<TE>   The new guidance compares with a previous forecast of $35 million
in revenue and pro forma earnings per share of 15 cents. The company
said it saw indications that near-term demand would be weaker than it
had expected.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the warning was not unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a lot of negative announcements by major personal
computer OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] and that couldn't
have helped Roxio's quarter," said Justin Cable, analyst with B.
Riley &amp; Co.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of users of high-speed Internet access, or broadband, has
quadrupled in two years, and the transmission speed is encouraging
people to search the Web more often.</LD>
<LD>   The United States had 24 million broadband users as of May, up
from 6 million in June 2000, according to a study by the Pew
Charitable Trust. That's prompting companies such as Verizon
Communications Inc. to upgrade networks to provide high-speed
Internet access, which is more expensive than dial-up connections.</LD>
<LD>   Broadband access was the most important factor in determining how
much time people spent on the Internet, the study found. Though 43%
of people with broadband access logged on to the Internet several
times a day, only 19% of dial-up users did so.</LD>

million in cash and 1.25 million Conexant shares.</LD>
<TE>   The purchase will let Conexant develop its Moving Picture Experts

cable set-top boxes, it said. GlobespanVirata said it sold the
business as part of a plan to focus on broadband, or high-speed,
products.</TE>

<HD>Lantronix Restates Financial Statements</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>A Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lantronix Inc., an Irvine maker of network hardware and software
products, restated 12 months of financial statements, knocking $7.4
million off its revenue and adding $1.5 million to its losses over
the period. The company said the restated results help it comply with
Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the company reported a net loss of $8.7 million, or
16 cents a share, for the fiscal third quarter ended March 31,
compared with last year's third-quarter loss of $851,000, or 2 cents
a share. Revenue rose 17% to $14.6 million.</LD>
<LD>   After the chief financial officer was fired last month, a
financial review by directors found that certain sales to
distributors in the last half of fiscal 2001 and the first half of
2002 did not qualify as revenue because of special terms negotiated
with certain distributors.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, the company increased last year's net loss by $3.2
million to $7.2 million, or 19 cents a share, and lowered the loss
for the first six months this year by $1.7 million to $4.2 million,
or 9 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock lost 9 cents to close at 86 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Hansen Has Hit It Off in an Unassuming Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At some point this summer, a public address announcer will say Dave
Hansen's name, he'll step to the plate, get a hit and a record will
fall.</LD>
<LD>   Don't expect much fanfare. It's the Dodger record for pinch-hits,
and the only thing less glamorous than a pinch-hitting record is ...
pinch-hitting itself.</LD>
<LD>   If you think about it, pinch-hitting is the batters' equivalent of
a closer in pitching. Late-inning specialist. Called upon in pressure
situations.</LD>
<TE>   The most dramatic home run hit in Los Angeles was a pinch-hit:
Kirk Gibson's wobbly legged homer off Oakland's Dennis Eckersley in
Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. That ought to help the cause.</TE>
<TE>   Uh-uh. Pinch-hitters get no love. They don't even get a title
without a hyphen.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Gagne makes the switch to closer, saves a few games (OK,
saves a lot of games) and the crowd greets him like a rock star when
he runs out of the bullpen at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Hansen? He could grab a vendors badge and work the aisles
selling peanuts and the only way he would get a second glance was if
he gave the wrong change.</TE>
<TE>   This for the man who needs only three more pinch-hits to break
Manny Mota's team record of 106.</TE>
<TE>   Where's the justice?</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing in this game is unfair," Hansen insists. "I've
brainwashed myself to always think of the positives of anything. It's
not a glamorous role by any means, but I enjoy the heck out of it ...
now. When I first started 10 years ago, I didn't even know how I was
doing it. It was just happening. Over the years of experience it just
became part of me as a baseball player."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it's come to be his defining quality as a baseball
player. Aside from the occasional fill-in to give a starter the day
off, Hansen's job is to wait on the bench until his name is called.</TE>
<TE>   "From a preparation standpoint, or a guy that accepts that role
... there's nobody better at it," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "The
most important part about it is the fact that you accept your role
and as a result of that you're going to give it whatever you've got,
knowing that you're only going to get one shot. He is outstanding at
that."</TE>
<TE>   Either he found his niche, or it found him. In 1992, the year he
started 98 games at third base and had the most at-bats of his
career, he also had his lowest batting average (.214). The next year
he played in only 84 games, and had 105 at-bats, but he batted .362
and set a Dodger record with 18 pinch-hits.</TE>
<TE>   He still yearned to start, and after a few more years, including
one spent on the Chicago Cubs' bench, he left for Japan for a season
to be an everyday player.</TE>
<TE>   While there, he learned to teach himself, to correct his errors.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the communication gap, you're just not going get the
same coaching," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His family enjoyed learning a new culture and the time they spent
together. But he missed the intense competition of the major leagues.
So when the Dodgers called to offer him another job, he happily
accepted it, knowing full well he would be a pinch-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   And instead of working by himself, he got tips from perhaps the
greatest pinch-hitter of all-time. Mota, who has been a coach with
the Dodgers for 23 years, used to hold the major-league record for
pinch-hits. His mark of 150 was broken by Lenny Harris last year.</TE>
<TE>   Mota has distilled the technique into these basics: concentration,
positive thinking and believing in yourself.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are, to me, the three ingredients to be a good
pinch-hitter," Mota said. "Besides that, you've got to make contact.
And if you make contact, you've got to pray."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hansen: "I've learned a lot from Manny. Probably most of the
mental preparation and the approach to pinch-hitting from Manny. He
obviously had it down."</TE>
<TE>   Hansen starts focusing from the time he steps on the field for
practice, even if his turn at the plate might not come for another
four to five hours--if it comes at all.</TE>
<TE>   He likes to face a lot of off-speed stuff in practice, because
adjusting to different tempos is the hardest part of coming in cold.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all mental," Hansen said. "It's so different from playing
every day and getting in the flow of the game, because you've got to
get in the flow of the game from the bench. It's kind of tough."</TE>
<TE>   He gets so focused, he didn't even notice a curious daughter
poking around to see what daddy was doing during an interview in the
dugout. And he wasn't aware of the team pinch-hit record until
reporters mentioned it.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know I was that close," Hansen said. "Because the rule
of thumb for pinch-hitting is that you don't worry about numbers,
stats. All you worry about is how you feel day-to-day. Because if you
start worrying about the big picture, it's too much to handle."</TE>
<TE>   Hansen set a record with seven pinch-hit home runs in the 2000
season. Harris and John Vander Wal are the only active players with
more pinch-hits in their careers.</TE>
<TE>   And now Hansen is closing in on the Dodger record.</TE>
<TE>   "The record is meant to be broken," Mota said. "Who else better
than Davey Hansen to break the record?</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great hitter. He's a great friend. He's a great person.
I'd be happy the day Dave Hansen breaks the record. He's a great
human being."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it just takes a fellow pinch-hitter to acknowledge it.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Cameron homered and drove in four runs, and the Seattle Mariners
ended the Oakland Athletics' eight-game winning streak with a 7-1
victory Tuesday night at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   After losing the opener of the four-game series, 13-2, Monday
night, the Mariners got a strong start from James Baldwin to increase
their lead to three games over the Athletics in the American League
West. It was Oakland's second loss in 18 games.</LD>
<LD>   Oakland is 19-4 this month, with three of the losses coming
against the Mariners.</LD>
<TE>   Baldwin (6-6) pitched seven innings to win his second consecutive
start and the Mariners handed Tim Hudson (5-7) his fifth loss in
seven decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron, who had been batting .212 and had a league-high 83
strikeouts, hit a three-run homer against Mike Venafro in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   The Athletics took a 1-0 lead in the third on David Justice's
bizarre sacrifice fly that scored Randy Velarde from third.</TE>
<TE>   With runners at the corners, left fielder Charles Gipson made an
outstanding catch of Justice's drive before hitting the fence hard.
Miguel Tejada was thrown out rounding second on the play.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 4, New York 3--Jerry Hairston drove in the tiebreaking
run with a suicide squeeze in the seventh inning at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Cordova had three hits and two runs batted in for Baltimore,
which defeated Andy Pettitte (1-2). Alfonso Soriano and Derek Jeter
hit solo homers for the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 3-3, Ramiro Mendoza came in to face Hairston,
whose bunt toward first base scored Brian Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 4, Boston 2--Jim Thome hit his 20th homer to lead the
Indians at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Boston's Manny Ramirez went one for five in his first game after
six weeks on the disabled list because of a broken finger. He struck
out with runners on first and third to end it.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Castillo (5-8), who was able to start after appealing a
five-game suspension for bumping an umpire last week, gave up a
three-run homer to Thome in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 20, Tampa Bay 11--Jose Cruz Jr. went four for five with a
career-high six RBIs, and Carlos Delgado homered and drove in five
runs at St. Petersburg, Fla., helping the Blue Jays to their
highest-scoring game in 24 years.</TE>
<TE>   Vernon Wells, Felipe Lopez and Joe Lawrence also homered for the
Blue Jays, who beat Baltimore, 24-10, in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Wells had a two-run double in a four-run first inning.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 8, Detroit 6--Raul Ibanez matched his career high with
four RBIs, helping the Royals rally at Kansas City, Mo., in the first
game involving two Dominican managers--Detroit's Luis Pujols and
Kansas City's Tony Pena.</TE>
<TE>   Ibanez homered with Joe Randa aboard in the fifth against reliever
Julio Santana (3-2) to end a 5-5 tie and make a winner of Jeff Suppan
(6-6).</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City's Mike Sweeney went three for four with a home run and
two doubles to raise his batting average to .358, second in the AL.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 15, Minnesota 7--Magglio Ordonez drove in five runs at
Minneapolis, and Chicago pounded a season-high 23 hits to overcome a
subpar outing by ace Mark Buehrle.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Paul had two RBIs for Chicago, which ended a four-game losing
streak and had a season high in runs.</TE>
<TE>   Dustan Mohr drove in three runs and Cristian Guzman homered for
Minnesota, which scored six runs in six innings against Buehrle
(11-5).</TE>

<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>The thick black hair is gone, replaced by a shaved head.</LD>
<LD>   The bubbly personality is gone, replaced by a quiet demeanor.</LD>
<LD>   The impressive pitching statistics also are gone, replaced by a
break-even won-lost record and a bloated earned-run average.</LD>
<TE>   Right-hander Chan Ho Park, who thrived in his early years in Los
Angeles, is just trying to survive in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to get the big bucks he was seeking from the Dodgers, Park
signed a five-year, $65-million contract with the Rangers in
December. Hampered by a hamstring injury since the spring, he is only
3-3 with an ERA of 8.52. In eight years with the Dodgers, he was
80-54 with a 3.80 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Park's biggest problem is a hamstring injury he suffered in the
last game of spring training. Determined to fulfill his obligations
to his new team, he insisted on going ahead with his opening-day
assignment, but he was obviously in pain. He went on the disabled
list the next day, the first time he had been on the DL, and stayed
there from April 2 until May 12.</TE>
<TE>   And he has been playing catch-up ever since.</TE>
<TE>   In a game earlier this month against the Kansas City Royals, he
had a 7-0 lead by the fourth inning but pitched poorly and was gone
by the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I am putting too much pressure on myself," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoonki Min, a Korean sportswriter who covered Park in Los Angeles
and now in Arlington for Sports Chosun, a Korean daily, sees the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rangers gave him a lot of money," Min said, "and he wants to
show he is worth it. It's a whole new experience for him in a new
league with a team that hoped he would be the ace of the staff. Then
he got the injury. It's bad timing."</TE>
<TE>   In Korea, the shaved head is seen as a sign of determination by
some, an act to change one's luck by others. Park hopes it is both.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are hoping utility man Shawn Wooten, recovering from a
pulled muscle on his right side, will be ready to begin a
rehabilitation assignment on Friday with Class-A Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>

his back. His replacement, the 24-year-old Myette, was recalled from
the Rangers' Oklahoma RedHawk farm team for the second game of
Monday's doubleheader. Myette's only appearance with the Rangers came
on June 9 against the Atlanta Braves. He pitched two innings and gave
up two earned runs.</TE>

<HD>Griffey Is Put on Disabled List Again</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ken Griffey Jr. was put on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday, the
second time this season the Cincinnati Reds have lost their star
outfielder to injury.</LD>
<LD>   Griffey strained a hamstring while running to first base June 7
and hasn't fully recovered. He aggravated the injury while legging
out a double Sunday, and didn't play in the Reds' 6-4 loss to the
Chicago Cubs on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   "Initially, we thought it was less than he'd done two weeks
prior," Red Manager Bob Boone said. "He came in [Monday] and did some
tests, and it's more sore than it was the day before. He was not able
to participate."</LD>
<TE>   Griffey won't be eligible to play until after the All-Star game.
He will need at least a week to heal.</TE>
<TE>   "If we err, hopefully he's ready in a week and we'll just make
[the hamstring] be more ready," Boone said.</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Austin Kearns was recalled from triple-A Louisville to
replace Griffey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona third baseman Matt Williams and second baseman Jay Bell
will begin rehabilitation assignments with the Lancaster JetHawks
next week and remain with the California League club until July 13.</TE>
<TE>   Williams broke his left foot during spring training and Bell has
been sidelined since late March because of calf problems. Neither has
played this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay put outfielder Greg Vaughn on the 15-day disabled list
because of a bruised right shoulder and pitcher Ryan Rupe because of
knee tendinitis.... Baltimore purchased the contract of left-hander
Yorkis Perez from triple-A Rochester and sent seldom-used pitcher
Sean Douglass to Rochester.</TE>

<HD>In BCS, Routs Now Pointless</HD>
<DH>College football: Margin of victory eliminated; more
importance given to strength of schedule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>College football teams will no longer be rewarded for running up the
score against overmatched opponents, and more importance will be
placed on strength of schedule as the result of changes announced
Tuesday in the bowl championship series ratings formula.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Tranghese, BCS coordinator and Big East Conference
commissioner, said the margin-of-victory component in the computer
polls would be eliminated and the quality-win component would be
reduced to teams in the top 10 of the BCS rankings. Previously,
victories over teams in the top 15 counted as quality wins.</LD>
<LD>   Tranghese said he hoped the changes, which take effect this fall,
would create a fairer system for determining which teams meet in the
national championship game.</LD>
<TE>   The margin-of-victory component came under fire last season after
Oregon, ranked second in the coaches' and media polls, was denied a
spot in the national title game because the Ducks had finished No. 4
in the final BCS rankings. Oregon, which won several close games,
ranked only seventh in the four computers that considered margin of
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Strength of schedule is a more valuable measuring tool than
margin of victory," Tranghese said. "A computer can't get at the
nuances of margin of victory.... I thought it was being given too
much weight."</TE>
<TE>   Tranghese sent a letter last week to computer operators informing
them that they would have to remove margin of victory from their
systems as a condition of remaining in the BCS formula. Two of the
four operators who used the component--Peter Wolfe and Jeff
Sagarin--said they would comply with the edict. The other two--David
Rothman and Herman Matthews of Scripps-Howard--refused to change
their formulas and are out of the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   In explaining his position, Los Angeles-based Rothman said in a
statement, "The current efforts to remove margin of victory are only
going to degrade the computer's image, as human participants will
continue to do the best they can, utilizing all information that can
be ascertained, including margins."</TE>
<TE>   But Tranghese said he didn't want a coach with a comfortable lead
"trying to figure out if he should score another touchdown because it
might help him get in the national championship game."</TE>
<TE>   Seven computers will be used next season among the four elements
in the BCS formula, which also incorporates coaches' and media polls,
strength of schedule and team records. The New York Times will be
added to the computer lineup, which will have one fewer computer than
last season because of the two dropouts.</TE>
<TE>   When the weekly BCS compilations begin Oct. 21, each team's worst
computer ranking will be discarded and an average of the six other
computer ratings will be used.</TE>
<TE>   In response to college football's increase to a 12-game regular
season in 2002 instead of the usual 11, Tranghese said teams would
need a 9-3 record and a top-12 ranking in the final BCS standings to
be eligible for one of the four BCS games--the Rose, Fiesta, Sugar
and Orange bowls.</TE>
<TE>   The Fiesta Bowl plays host to the national championship game on
Jan. 3.</TE>

<HD>That Had to Hurt</HD>
<DH>Knee injury puts a crimp in Sam Clancy's plan for the NBA
draft</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sam Clancy had a plan.</LD>
<LD>   The former USC power forward would go through individual workouts
with NBA teams, rather than participate in the pre-draft camps,
impress prospective employers and, with his Pacific 10 Conference
player-of-the-year season on his updated resume, solidify his
position as a first-round draft pick. Maybe even turn himself into a
lottery choice, one of the first 13 players selected.</LD>
<LD>   But Clancy's plan derailed May 13, in his first outing, when he
dislocated his left kneecap and tore a tendon during a workout with
the Phoenix Suns. Clancy, who'd suffered the same injuries as a high
school sophomore, underwent surgery to strengthen the knee and did
not visit any other teams after the procedure.</LD>
<TE>   Out of sight and, seemingly, out of mind, Clancy, a second-team
All-American, is not sure now if he'll even be selected in the first
round of tonight's draft in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Only first-round draft picks receive guaranteed contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "It affected me because I couldn't work out for teams and they
couldn't see me firsthand, so it definitely hurts [my status]," said
Clancy, who spent a month of rehab in Los Angeles before returning to
his home in Cleveland. "I've heard that this draft is just crazy.
From the No. 15 pick to the end of the first round, nobody has any
clue where they're going.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm not that frustrated. I'm not worried or scared. I know
I'm still late first round to early second round. That's my range."</TE>
<TE>   His range should have been better after leading the Trojans in
scoring (19.1 points), rebounding (9.4) and blocked shots (48). Plus,
he had already played in the Chicago pre-draft camp after his junior
season, where he'd led in scoring and rebounding before pulling his
name from the early-entrant list and returning to USC. He was listed
as a late first-round pick last summer.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, Clancy had planned to work out for 15 teams.
Instead, he has had to put his faith in his agent, Bob Meyer, to
extol his client's virtues by sending out videotapes of Clancy in
action, along with medical records and doctors' statements claiming
that Clancy is fine.</TE>
<TE>   NBA scouting guru Marty Blake compared Clancy's predicament to the
one experienced by former Texas forward Chris Owens, whose season
abruptly ended in December when he tore a ligament in his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   "Without those injuries, they'd both go very high," Blake said.
"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Guys with the ability of Owens
and Clancy should go high, as long as the doctors say they're OK.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knows about Clancy. He's a quick jumper and a tuned
player. He's aggressive and that's going to help him, as long as he's
healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy said that although his injury and subsequent surgery would
not allow him to play for his new team's summer league squad, he
would be able to take part in training camp from the start.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's the case, then that's great," Blake said. "Will he fall
[in the draft]? That's hard to say. But if he's fully recovered and
he does slip a little [but stays in the first round], he'll go to a
better team and be able to hone his skills."</TE>
<TE>   The 240-pound Clancy's height was listed generously by USC as 6
feet 7, which some think is undersized for an NBA power forward.
Blake took issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard the knock that he's too small," Blake said. "Look,
Charles Barkley was not 12 feet tall. Sam Clancy can play.</TE>
<TE>   "If he slips, somebody's going to get a hell of a player."</TE>
<TE>   And if he goes in the first round, he'll be the third Trojan to go
that high since 1980, joining Harold Miner, No. 12 in 1992, and
Rodrick Rhodes, No. 24 in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy said, "There's no one place I want to go above everywhere
else, though I'd like to go someplace where I haven't been before. A
change of scenery would be nice."</TE>

<HD>Portugal's Quick Exit Will Cost Coach His Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Antonio Oliveira will be replaced as Portugal coach because of the
country's dismal performance in the World Cup, the head of the
Portuguese Soccer Federation announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "The federation's decision is that he cannot continue" in the job,
federation chief Gilberto Madail said.</LD>
<LD>   Oliveira was out of the country, but Madail said the federation
sent him a fax proposing an amicable agreement to end his contract,
which expires in 2004.</LD>
<TE>   "If he doesn't accept, we will have to look at our legal and
soccer options," Madail said.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal exited the World Cup in the first round after stunning
losses against underdog South Korea, the co-host, and the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Oliveira, 50, took over two years ago and guided Portugal through
its undefeated World Cup qualifying campaign.</TE>
<TE>   He has recorded the most wins for a Portuguese national coach (26)
and has the most games in charge (43).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gerhard Aigner, chief executive of European soccer's ruling body
UEFA, said the sport's authorities should consider using two referees
in major matches. His comments followed a string of disputed
decisions at the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Aigner told UEFA's Web site that experimentation with two
referees, to go along with the two linesmen, should be undertaken in
matches outside the top echelon of pro soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "Before we start to talk about cameras, slow-motion replays or
stopping the game, we should exploit human resources," he said. "We
never had a serious test with two referees."</TE>
<TE>   Aigner added that more than one referee from the same country
should be used for tournaments such as the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   England goalkeeper David Seaman said he will take the rest of the
summer before deciding whether to quit international soccer.</TE>
<TE>   The Arsenal goalkeeper admitted he was considering retiring after
being left devastated by England's 2-1 quarterfinal loss to Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   The 38-year-old let in Brazilian striker Ronaldinho's long-range
free kick in the match when he was caught off his line.</TE>
<TE>   Seaman stumbled backward to try to reach the ball, but it dropped
over his head and under the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson says if Seaman is still the
best goalkeeper at his disposal, he will continue to pick him for the
European Championship campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "For me that's great," Seaman said. "But I've had discussions with
people that are close to me regarding my future with England and I've
just got to sit down in the summer, have a nice holiday and think
what I want.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether that includes retirement I don't know, but it's something
that I haven't ruled out.</TE>
<TE>   "But you are always remembered for your last game and it's not
exactly something I want to finish on, but who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   British bookmakers have made Germany the second favorite at odds
of 13-8 to win the World Cup following Tuesday's semifinal victory
over South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time champion Germany was listed at 16-1 to win the trophy
before the tournament began.</TE>
<TE>   Four-time champion Brazil is the favorite at 8-13.</TE>
<TE>   Making its first semifinal appearance, Turkey is 9-1.</TE>

<HD>Dreifort Draws a Crowd at Workout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What pitcher Darren Dreifort figured would be a routine step in his
return from elbow reconstruction surgery--the right-hander faced
hitters for the first time since his July 9 procedure Tuesday,
throwing 31 batting practice pitches off the Dodger Stadium
mound--turned into something of a spectacle.</LD>
<LD>   Chairman Bob Daly and General Manager Dan Evans, senior vice
presidents Dave Wallace (baseball operations) and Derrick Hall
(communications), Manager Jim Tracy, pitching coach Jim Colborn and
more than a dozen teammates and coaches surrounded the cage as
Dreifort threw to Dave Hansen, Jeff Reboulet and Alex Cora.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess it was a bigger deal for everybody else than it was for
me," Dreifort said, almost embarrassed by all the attention. "I have
a lot of work to do, and this is just a starting point. There's no
reason to get [all worked up] about it."</LD>
<TE>   The crowd was a testament to Dreifort's popularity and the
Dodgers' considerable investment in him--Dreifort is in the second
year of a five-year, $55-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers expect Dreifort back at some point this season, but
they don't want to pressure him by pinpointing a date.</TE>
<TE>   Dreifort, who recently began throwing his slider, will, barring
setbacks, throw a mixture of batting practice and bullpen sessions
for several weeks before throwing simulated games and embarking on a
minor league rehabilitation assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked like he's been pitching all year the way he was
throwing [Tuesday]," outfielder Shawn Green said. "He still has to
get his endurance up, but his stuff looks tremendous."</TE>
<TE>   Team physician Frank Jobe likes the way the inside of Dreifort's
elbow looks. Dreifort's injury was caused by a complete calcification
of the medial collateral ligament, which essentially "turned to bone"
and snapped last June.</TE>
<TE>   But Dreifort has been on anti-inflammatory medication since his
surgery, and periodic X-rays have revealed no calcification in the
ligament.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was going to happen again, it would have started showing by
now," Jobe said. "We've taken all the precautions."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers won't rush Dreifort back.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be very patient with him, and that will pay off in
years to come," Evans said. "What we saw today was very encouraging,
but he's just not there yet."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Beltre's occasional lackadaisical play continues to
frustrate the Dodgers--the third baseman took far too much time on
Terry Shumpert's fifth-inning grounder Monday night and sailed his
throw over first baseman Eric Karros' head for his 13th error, the
most of any National League third baseman.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy refused to criticize Beltre, but he made it clear the
Dodgers believe he is underachieving when he said: "I've talked to
him numerous times, and if there's one guy in our league who should
have some Gold Glove awards on his mantel, it's him. If I had his
abilities, I would make it my priority to have a couple of those."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jobe said Tuesday that it's "possible" Kevin Brown, who had
surgery for a herniated disk in his lower back June 11, could pitch
again this season, "but I don't want to say for sure at this point."
Jobe added that there is only a "tiny" amount of fluid left in
Brown's surgically repaired right elbow.</TE>

<HD>Trial Move From Fairplex Is Sought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The men who will argue today to move the 17-day Los Angeles County
Fair horse racing meet from Pomona's Fairplex Park to Arcadia's Santa
Anita Park say it's a gamble every handicapper craves: a sure thing.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Anita President Jack Liebau and Los Angeles County Fair
Assn. President/Chief Executive James Henwood will request that the
lease agreement be approved on a one-year trial basis. If the
seven-member California Horse Racing Board approves, horse racing at
Fairplex Park will be halted after 63 seasons.</LD>
<LD>   "We've proposed the pilot plan for two reasons: No one can tell us
why this move will hurt them; and if you're so convinced this is a
bad idea, then pass it for a year and let it prove us wrong," Liebau
said.</LD>
<TE>   The one-year pilot suggestion is a response to the board's June 6
meeting, when it voted, 3-3, on a motion to reject the move. Member
Marie Moretti abstained.</TE>
<TE>   The split vote was followed by an agreement to conduct today's
special meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The fair meet is scheduled for Sept. 13-29.</TE>
<TE>   Racing boards and executives from Hollywood Park and Del Mar
Thoroughbred Club, along with Oak Tree Racing Assn., which conducts
its fall meet at Santa Anita, are opposed to the move--so are the
Thoroughbred Owners of California and the California Thoroughbred
Trainers.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the CHRB dated June 19, Thoroughbred Owners
President John Van de Kamp said his group supports the idea of
reallocating Fairplex horse racing dates among Hollywood Park, Del
Mar and Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Elio Amato, president of the Fairplex Owners and Trainers Assn.,
said his group opposes the move because Henwood has not provided
assurances that he will fight to reinstate year-round training at
Fairplex and the uncertain outcome of Henwood's negotiations to
purchase the Barretts Equine Sales at Fairplex from Barretts Equine
Limited.</TE>

<HD>Hasek Ends Stellar Two-Decade Career</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dominik Hasek, one of the most accomplished goaltenders in history,
will retire to the Czech Republic as a Stanley Cup champion.</LD>
<LD>   "The Dominator" made the announcement Tuesday, nearly two weeks
after topping off an impressive resume with the elusive title at the
end of a one-season stop with the Detroit Red Wings.</LD>
<LD>   "Winning the Cup has been everything I could ever ask for," Hasek
said. "After 21 years of playing professional hockey at the highest
level, I do not feel that I have enough fire in me to compete at the
level that I expect of myself."</LD>
<TE>   Hasek, 37, sought a trade from Buffalo to Detroit because he
wasn't satisfied with his six Vezina Trophies as the NHL's best
goalie, two Hart Trophies as the league's most valuable player and a
gold medal with the Olympic champion Czech Republic at the 1998
Nagano Games.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the best decision I made throughout my hockey career,"
Hasek said. "I am and will be a Red Wing forever."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington hired Bruce Cassidy, who has never spent a day behind
the bench in the NHL, as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Cassidy, 37, spent the last two seasons with Grand Rapids in the
AHL. He led the Griffins to a division championship and a 42-27-11-0
record in his first year.</TE>
<TE>   He also coached in the old International Hockey League and the
East Coast Hockey League.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay exercised its option on left wing Dave Andreychuk for
next season. Andreychuk, 38, led the team with 21 goals. He signed
with the Lightning as a free agent in July. Andreychuk has 593 goals
and 1,247 points in 20 seasons.... Defenseman Jeff Woywitka, 18,
signed a three-year entry-level contract with Philadelphia. He was
the team's first-round pick in the 2001 draft.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Trade Shields for a 2003 Pick</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks traded goalie Steve Shields, a piece of the Teemu
Selanne deal, to the Boston Bruins Tuesday for a third-round draft
pick in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins signed Shields, a restricted free agent, to a two-year
deal for a base salary of $1.2 million, with incentives that could
push it over $2 million. The deal further indicates that Boston
officials have no interest in re-signing unrestricted free agent
Byron Dafoe after his disappointing performance in the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm ecstatic, I'm really excited," Shields said. "It's going to
be a great opportunity with a team that is in contention to win a lot
of games and be successful. That's all I ask for."</LD>
<TE>   Duck General Manager Bryan Murray said he was offered a player but
chose the draft pick instead. He also talked with other teams,
including Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks felt Shields, 30, was expendable after Jean-Sebastien
Giguere established himself as the team's No. 1 goalie. Giguere was
fifth in the NHL in goals-against average (2.13) and save percentage
(.920). The Ducks would have had to make Shields a qualifying offer
of $2 million--his salary last season--by the end of June or lose him
as a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Shields and forward Jeff Friesen were acquired for Selanne in
March 2001.</TE>

on the Red Sox signing Ted Williams' 33-year-old son, John Henry

<HD>Cardinals Lose After Kile Memorial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Cardinals have shown there are many ways to honor
Darryl Kile. One of them is to win more games.</LD>
<LD>   "As DK put it, we've got work to do," reliever Mike Timlin said.
"It may sound cold, but this is what we do."</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinals, struggling to stay focused, managed only four hits
and lost to the Milwaukee Brewers, 2-0, Tuesday night for their
fourth consecutive defeat.</LD>
<TE>   Several Cardinals wept openly during a memorial service that began
with 57 seconds of silence--Kile's uniform number--and a video
tribute before the team's first home game since the pitcher died
Saturday in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Between innings, Kile's career highlights and accomplishments were
listed on the video board. His jersey hung in the dugout tunnel
leading to the clubhouse. That made it tough to concentrate.</TE>
<TE>   "Every half-inning they played something for DK," reliever Steve
Kline said. "You watch it and it just hits you again."</TE>
<TE>   After the game, pitcher Matt Morris issued a brief statement
instead of taking questions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all still in shock over Darryl," Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   But Manager Tony La Russa wanted no part of excuses.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be discussing stuff like that because it'll be a
subject every day and it's counterproductive," La Russa said.
"Everybody knows how we feel about Darryl.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the game speaks for itself, 2-zip and in the end, what we
do for a living, that's the measure."</TE>
<TE>   Team personnel wore small black, circular patches with Kile's
initials and number, "DK57," on their left sleeve. They were already
wearing a patch to commemorate the death of longtime broadcaster Jack
Buck, who died four days before Kile, on their right sleeve. Larger
versions of the patches were on the right-field wall and behind the
plate.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers will participate in a memorial service for Kile today
at Busch Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad I'm here," Manager Jerry Royster said. "It amazes me how
the baseball fans in the city of St. Louis handle situations like
this."</TE>
<TE>   Morris (10-5) gave up two runs and six hits in seven innings,
striking out six and walking two.</TE>
<TE>   He threw a lot of curveballs in the first few innings, perhaps a
tribute to Kile. That was his signature pitch.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals have been outscored, 15-6, during the losing streak,
which began Thursday, the day of a Busch Stadium visitation and
memorial service for Buck.</TE>
<TE>   Glendon Rusch (5-5) retired 13 batters in a row at one point. He
struck out three and walked none for his second career shutout. His
other one came while with Kansas City in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a difficult night, knowing what everybody over there is
going through and knowing that against Morris, you're not going to
get too many runs," Rusch said. "My heart goes out to DK's family."</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard,
observed, worn, viewed, dialed or downloaded, it's in play here. One
exception: No products will be endorsed.</LD>
<LD>   What: "Answer Guy"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Anonymous</LD>
<TE>   Publishers: Hyperion and ESPN the Magazine</TE>
<TE>   Price: $12.95</TE>
<TE>   There are lots of questions in this 158-page paperback book, but
few straight answers. The answers are there, the reader just has to
weed through a lot of cutesy prose to find them.</TE>
<TE>   The book is a compilation of Answer Guy columns from ESPN the
Magazine. And like so much of what is in the magazine, it's a
difficult read.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second book that ESPN the Magazine and Hyperion have
teamed up on. The first was Dan Patrick's "Outtakes."</TE>
<TE>   Right after a flippant foreword by Patrick comes the first hint
that things are going to be complicated. There's a two-page guide
that is supposed to help explain the author's madness. Sources are
named in italic type, their answers are in roman and what Answer Guy
has to say is in bold face.</TE>
<TE>   If it sounds hard to follow, it's because it is.</TE>
<TE>   The book's first question is, why is a basket worth two points?
It's a good question, as are most in the book. The first source,
scout Marty Blake, doesn't know. Neither does ESPN's Mike Soltys. An
NBA historian finally gives the right answer--that they had to
differentiate a field goal from a foul shot. In some early
leagues--around 1902--a field goal was one point and a foul shot a
half point.</TE>
<TE>   The next question is, why do football teams get four chances to
make a first down, followed by another convoluted answer. Maybe long,
convoluted answers are needed to fill up the book. Is that the
reason? Maybe Answer Guy knows the answer to that.</TE>

<HD>Heisman Will Be Presented at Yale Club</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Heisman Trophy is moving uptown from its home in the Downtown
Athletic Club, whose long-term financial troubles were heightened by
the Sept. 11 terrorist attack.</LD>
<LD>   This year's trophy will be presented at the Yale Club in Midtown
on Dec. 14, said Jim Corcoran, president of the Downtown Athletic
Club.</LD>
<LD>   "This is certainly an appropriate venue for the award presentation
and the prestige of the Heisman is perpetuated by the association
[with the Yale Club]," Corcoran said.</LD>
<TE>   Corcoran said the move is temporary for now. Last year's
presentation was at a Manhattan hotel.</TE>
<TE>   A long-running decline in revenue, combined with a post-Sept. 11
drop in visitors, created uncertainty over the Downtown Athletic
Club's ability to remain in its landmark Art Deco building, said Rudy
Riska, the trophy's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   The club, about three blocks from where the World Trade Center
stood, has been shuttered since the attack.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three days after Chris McCarron's triumphant exit from riding, a win
on Came Home, jockey Patti Cooksey will try for a successful return
today at Churchill Downs.</LD>
<LD>   Cooksey, 44, had breast cancer surgery nearly 10 months ago and
will ride for the first time since Sept. 7 when she climbs on Gold
Empress in the fourth race, a $30,000 maiden claimer at one mile.</LD>
<LD>   The second-winningest female jockey behind hall-of-famer Julie
Krone, Cooksey, who began her career in 1979, had a mastectomy, but
has been working to return to riding.</LD>
<TE>   Gold Empress, a 4-year-old Miner's Mark filly owned by Richard,
Bertram and Elaine Klein and trained by Steve Flint, could get
Cooksey to the winner's circle. The $100,000 yearling purchase hasn't
come close in three starts since finishing second in her debut Aug.
4, but this will be her first start in a claimer.</TE>
<TE>   At Hollywood Park, Vladimir Cerin has a chance to take the lead
from Bobby Frankel in the trainers' standings.</TE>
<TE>   Through Sunday, Cerin had 13 winners, one fewer than Frankel, who
isn't running any horses today. Cerin will start two and both are
contenders. Six G's, who has won his last two, will make his first
start for the trainer in the fifth after having been claimed for
$50,000 on June 5, and Spunky Gal should improve in her second start
of the year in the seventh, a $48,000 allowance for fillies and mares
at 5 1/2 furlongs on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The sixth is a $16,000 claimer at six furlongs
bringing together old pros Scoop Of Ice, Nikawa and eight others.
Scoop Of Ice is stepping up two levels after having been claimed by
trainer Ted H. West.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Mark Guidry. The jockey won 10 races in five days last
week at Churchill Downs and is in the running to finish second behind
perennial leader Pat Day in the standings, as are Jon Court and
Calvin Borel.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: A.C. Avila. The trainer is 0 for 29 at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Six G's, Rumor Patrol and
Groom On The Run in the fifth, singling Scoop Of Ice in the sixth,
using Teresa Ann, Re Vote and Spunky Gal in the seventh and Our Lov
Bug, Good Ol' Uncle Joe, Sir Bertrando and Grand Visions in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/121. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $11.20/$698.40. Total money bet: $774.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Go Shopping for Bench Strength</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: A backup big man or a big point
guard/shooting guard seems high on their list.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers will choose a player from a college or high school or
foreign country tonight who will practice two hours a day and sit at
the end of their bench on game nights.</LD>
<LD>   The NBA draft is bigger news in other towns and for other
franchises.</LD>
<LD>   Assuming they stay in, the Lakers will be involved in the draft
for the first time since selecting Mark Madsen in the first round,
29th overall, two years ago. They choose 27th, meaning 113 players
will have been drafted and two championships will have been won
between Laker picks.</LD>
<TE>   They are hoping first for a player who can be a reserve center or
power forward, though the best of them are expected to be gone long
before the telephone rings on General Manager Mitch Kupchak's desk in
El Segundo, and it appears unlikely the Lakers will trade up for
something better.</TE>
<TE>   Their second preference is for a Phil Jackson signature point
guard, which is not a real point guard at all. Think Ron Harper or
Brian Shaw. If not, then a shooting guard that would allow Kobe
Bryant some wing time. And, then, they could lose small forward
Devean George to free agency, so they could use some help there ...</TE>
<TE>   "Typically it's unlikely you'll get an impact player at 27,"
Kupchak said. "But we feel there'll be a player available down there.
We've always done pretty well late in the draft."</TE>
<TE>   They have considered the likes of David Andersen, a 7-foot
Australian center, Kentucky forward Tayshaun Prince, Fresno State
forward Chris Jefferies, Inglewood High forward DeAngelo Collins,
Yugoslavian guard Mladen Sekularac, Stanford guard Casey Jacobsen,
Czech guard Jiri Welsch and Maryland guard Juan Dixon, among others.</TE>
<TE>   What they probably won't acquire tonight might be found among
summer free agents, though by all accounts that group is thin, making
it possible--even likely--that a Laker four-peat will be attempted
with less talent than the three-peat was accomplished. The Lakers
will attempt to re-sign George, but not recklessly.</TE>
<TE>   More likely, they'll wave at least part of their $4.6 million
mid-level exception at San Antonio Spur free-agent forward Malik
Rose, with the expectation that the Spurs will spend more freely to
re-sign him. Toronto forward Keon Clark is a restricted free agent
and attractive, but expected to re-sign with the Raptors.</TE>
<TE>   That could leave a group that includes Charles Oakley and Rodney
Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   A trade also is a possibility, particularly if someone comes
asking for Lindsey Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   The sense in the Laker front office, however, is that
teams--especially those in the Western Conference--are loathe to take
part in a transaction that might improve the three-time champions.</TE>

<LD>Here's how first round of NBA draft tonight could go, theoretically:</LD>
<LD>   1. HOUSTON  Yao Ming, 7-5, 296, Shanghai Sharks</LD>
<LD>   Projects don't often go No. l but that's what he is. Doesn't react
quickly to game situations, block shots or play in the post. On the
other hand, he's huge, mobile, has a nice touch and may learn.</LD>
<TE>   2.  CHICAGO Jay Williams, 6-0 1/4, 193, junior, Duke</TE>
<TE>   After two years as the best player in college, scouts began
dwelling on missed free throws and woolly shot selection, even though
he'd been moved to shooting guard and had to carry the offense. He
remains the best point guard prospect in years.</TE>
<TE>   3.  GOLDEN STATE Mike Dunleavy Jr., 6-8, 230, junior, Duke</TE>
<TE>   Once a frail guard, now a full-sized forward with range and
playmaking ability. Safe pick, although skeptics think he lacks the
upside of some younger prospects.</TE>
<TE>   4.  MEMPHIS Drew Gooden, 6-8 3/4, 227, junior, Kansas</TE>
<TE>   Great athlete who must show he's tough enough to play inside in
the NBA. Of course, Jerry West doesn't always do what he tells people
he will.</TE>
<TE>   5.  DENVER Nene Hilario, 6-9 1/4, 250, Vasco da Gama, Brazil</TE>
<TE>   Little known a month ago, his stock zoomed as teams working him
out were blown away by his size, strength and athleticism. Says one
GM, "What a stud!"</TE>
<TE>   6.  CLEVELAND Chris Wilcox, 6-8 1/4, 218, sophomore, Maryland</TE>
<TE>   Explosive young power forward who still needs to grow up and fill
out.</TE>
<TE>   7.  NEW YORK Jared Jeffries, 6-10, 230, sophomore, Indiana</TE>
<TE>   Big, young and skilled, his stock went up after he bulked up,
adding 15 pounds after the season.</TE>
<TE>   8.  CLIPPERS DaJuan Wagner, 6-0 3/4, 193, freshman, Memphis</TE>
<TE>   Clippers may not make this pick but the Cavaliers like him too.
His stock dropped because he's neither a playmaker nor a dominant
scorer but he has a big upside.</TE>
<TE>   9.  PHOENIX Nikoloz Tskitishvili, 6-10 1/2, 225, Benetton Treviso</TE>
<TE>   At 19, this Georgian is billed as the next Dirk Nowitzki, although
he barely played as a rookie. His Benetton coach, Mike D'Antoni, just
joined the Suns' staff and raves about him.</TE>
<TE>   10. MIAMI Caron Butler, 6-5 1/4, 222, sophomore, Connecticut</TE>
<TE>   Often compared to Paul Pierce and, like Pierce, looking at a
draft-day plunge. Great pick here: tough guy with skills, Pat Riley's
type of player.</TE>
<TE>   11.  WASHINGTON Bostjan Nachbar, 6-8, 221, Benetton Treviso</TE>
<TE>   Big, promising Croatian small forward.</TE>
<TE>   12.  CLIPPERS Melvin Ely, 6-9, 240, senior, Fresno State</TE>
<TE>   The best bet is that another team will make this pick too. This
guy turned out to be someone in his senior year.</TE>
<TE>   13.  MILWAUKEE Amare Stoudemire, 6-8 1/2, 233, Cypress Creek
(Fla.) H.S.</TE>
<TE>   He comes from a troubled family and bounced through six high
schools but comes across OK. Not much in the way of skills, but size,
athleticism and ferocity give him a chance to break big.</TE>
<TE>   14.  INDIANA Tayshaun Prince, 6-8, 215, senior, Kentucky</TE>
<TE>   Everyone thought they'd take Kareem Rush but they say they have a
surprise planned. Let's say, after all their years with Reggie
Miller, a lights-out shooter from the West Coast with a frail body
and a big heart, they go for the next generation.</TE>
<TE>   15. HOUSTON Qyntel Woods, 6-7, 213, sophomore, NE Mississippi J.C.</TE>
<TE>   Stock dropped like a rock over concerns he's the next DerMarr
Johnson rather than the next Tracy McGrady. With his upside, he's
worth a shot here.</TE>
<TE>   16.  PHILADELPHIA Dan Dickau, 6-0, 180, senior, Gonzaga</TE>
<TE>   A little sharpshooter--he made 15 consecutive three-pointers
working out for Orlando--he may be ticketed for Golden State in a
deal for Larry Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   17.  WASHINGTON Kareem Rush, 6-4 3/4, 199, junior, Missouri</TE>
<TE>   Athletic and can shoot but had a disappointing season. Nice young
man whose drive and court sense are in question.</TE>
<TE>   18.  ORLANDO Curtis Borchardt, 6-10 3/4, 238, junior, Stanford</TE>
<TE>   Stock tumbled on concerns about the foot injury that cost him his
sophomore season. Not physical but he blocks shots and has a nice
shooting touch. Good pick here for a team desperate for size.</TE>
<TE>   19.  UTAH Casey Jacobsen, 6-4 3/4, 215, junior, Stanford</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz has been hurting for a shooting guard since Jeff Hornacek
retired two seasons ago. He's hard-nosed and has game.</TE>
<TE>   20.  TORONTO Frank Williams, 6-1 1/2, 214, junior, Illinois</TE>
<TE>   Mysterious point guard who would have gone higher a year ago. Can
dominate or disappear. Raptors don't think Alvin Williams is really a
point.</TE>
<TE>   21.  PORTLAND Dan Gadzuric, 6-11, 240, senior, UCLA</TE>
<TE>   Big, athletic and plays hard, even if you fear he'll hurt himself
when he goes into one of his whirling-dervish post moves. On the
other hand, his lack of technique prompts optimists to think they can
teach him what he hasn't yet learned.</TE>
<TE>   22.  PHOENIX John Salmons, 6-5 1/2, 207, senior, Miami</TE>
<TE>   Stock zoomed last week after eye-opening workouts, including one
in Indiana where he shut down Jiri Welsch.</TE>
<TE>   23.  DETROIT Marcus Haislip, 6-8 1/2, 221, junior, Tennessee</TE>
<TE>   Bottom fell out of his stock late. Bad combination: Not very
skilled or very big.</TE>
<TE>   24.  NEW JERSEY Mladen Sekularac, 6-6 1/2, 210, FMP Zeleznik</TE>
<TE>   Big, talented, brash, Yugoslav shooting guard.</TE>
<TE>   25.  DENVER Jiri Welsch, 6-5 1/2, 208, Olimpia Ljubljana</TE>
<TE>   Highly rated Czech guard.</TE>
<TE>   26.  SAN ANTONIO Nenad Krstic, 6-10, 210, Partizan (Yugoslavia)</TE>
<TE>   Vlade Divac's protege who played for the team Divac owns in
Belgrade. Krstic is 19 and reedy but talented.</TE>
<TE>   27.  LAKERS Juan Dixon, 6-2, 164, senior, Maryland</TE>
<TE>   Too small for a shooting guard, doesn't handle well enough for a
point but he's a great shooter and the triangle doesn't have such
cut-and-dried roles. Think, Mike Penberthy who can stay in front of
people.</TE>
<TE>   28.  SACRAMENTO Carlos Boozer, 6-7 3/4, 257, junior, Duke</TE>
<TE>   Not an exciting prospect but he's got a wide body and some skills.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the bubble: David Andersen, 6-10, 240, Kinder Bologna; Roger
Mason, 6-3 1/2,199, junior, Virginia; Jason Jennings, 6-11 1/4, 249,
senior, Arkansas State; Smush Parker 6-2 1/2, 179, senior, Fordham;
D'Angelo Collins, 6-8 1/2, 230, Inglewood HS, Darius Songaila, 6-8,
248, senior, Wake Forest; Ryan Humphrey, 6-6, 223, senior, Notre
Dame.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Say It Is 50-50 They'll Get Miller in Trade</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another day passed and the Clippers were no closer to knowing
precisely what they will do tonight with their first-round picks in
the NBA draft. They have the eighth and 12th overall selections, but
have an interest in dealing with the Cleveland Cavaliers for standout
point guard Andre Miller.</LD>
<LD>   The word from the Clippers was only that talks continued Tuesday
and will continue today. A Clipper spokesman put the chances of a
completed deal at 50-50, the same figures Miller gave to an Ohio
newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   "It's something that could happen," Miller told the Akron Beacon
Journal. "That's between my agent, the coaches and [General Manager]
Jim Paxson to decide whether it happens. It's out of my hands."</LD>
<TE>   It's up to the Cavaliers to determine whether to part with Miller
as the first step in an overhaul of their roster.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers want Miller--or a point guard with similar shooting
and ballhandling skills--and are poised to give up draft picks, plus
a player on their roster.</TE>
<TE>   There have been strong indications that they will not re-sign Jeff
McInnis, who is eligible to become an unrestricted free agent Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Small forward Corey Maggette and shooting guard Quentin Richardson
have been mentioned in recent reports as players the Clippers would
give up. The Clippers say they would have a difficult time letting
either go because of the bond that has been developed in the last few
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was born and raised in Los Angeles, went to Verbum Dei High
and was the eighth overall pick in the 1999 draft after four seasons
at the University of Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Although Miller averaged 16.5 points and a league-leading 10.9
assists, the Cavaliers were 29-53 and did not advance to the playoffs
last season.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott Teaford</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Wizards traded guard Courtney Alexander to the New
Orleans Hornets for the 17th pick in the NBA draft.</TE>
<TE>   Washington will have two first-round picks tonight, including its
own at No. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander, 25, was acquired by the Wizards in February 2001 in a
seven-player trade that sent Juwan Howard to the Dallas Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   In 121 NBA games, he averaged 9.6 points, 2.4 rebounds and 1.2
assists. Last season, in 56 games, half of which were starts, he
averaged 9.8 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.5 assists.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A judge found Houston Rocket guard Steve Francis innocent of
drunken driving, concluding there was reasonable doubt whether the
player was legally intoxicated.</TE>
<TE>   Harris County Court-at-Law Judge James Anderson exonerated Francis
after a two-day bench trial in Houston. Francis, 25, was arrested
before dawn Dec. 16 after police said he turned left against a red
light.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Uncertain over playing time, guard Chauncey Billups of the
Minnesota Timberwolves opted out of the final $2.7-million season of
his three-year contract and will become a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Billups averaged 12.5 points, 5.5 assists and 28.7 minutes last
season, largely in a starter's role after Terrell Brandon had
season-ending knee surgery in February.</TE>
<TE>   Billups' agent said his client wants to start for a
championship-caliber team, and the uncertainty surrounding Brandon
was a major factor in his decision.</TE>
<TE>   Billups' decision further muddies an uncertain situation at point
guard for the Timberwolves. Seldom-used reserve Will Avery's contract
has expired and Brandon's future is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Denver Nuggets waived veteran guard Tim Hardaway, 35, who
played in only 14 games with them after being acquired from Dallas.
He averaged 9.6 points and 5.5 assists in Denver.</TE>

more than a year, with Benson repeatedly threatening to move the
team.</LD>

<HD>Bonds, Kent Engage in Shoving Match</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most startling hit Barry Bonds delivered Tuesday night was in the
dugout, against his San Francisco Giant teammate, Jeff Kent.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds shoved Kent in the chest during a scrape that spiced up the
San Diego Padres' 10-7 victory over the feuding Giants at San Diego.
Bonds hit his 592nd career homer in the third inning, right after the
dustup, and Kent hit a homer in the sixth.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute appeared to begin with Kent talking to third baseman
David Bell. Bonds got involved and as the argument escalated, he
shoved Kent.</LD>
<TE>   Bonds has stopped talking to reporters and Kent refused to talk to
anyone but a handful of San Francisco beat writers.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't even between them. Know what I'm saying?" Manager Dusty
Baker said. "Some guys got into it. It wasn't even between them."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Kent criticized Bonds' standoffish nature.</TE>
<TE>   In the second, Bell fielded Julius Matos' high chopper and tried
to force Wiki Gonzalez at second. Kent came off the bag too soon and
Gonzalez was safe before Kent could get his foot back on the bag.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres scored four runs in the inning for a 5-0 lead. The
Giants led, 7-5, going into the bottom of the seventh before the
Padres rallied.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 7, Arizona 3--Jeff Bagwell and Geoff Blum each hit two-run
homers in the eighth inning to lift the Astros at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   New York 7, Atlanta 4--Steve Trachsel (6-6) retired the first 15
batters at New York, and the Mets defeated Albie Lopez, who replaced
the injured Greg Maddux.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 5, Chicago 2--Luis Pineda (1-3) won his first
major-league start, and the Reds hit three homers at Chicago to end
an eight-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 4, Montreal 1--Kris Benson (1-4), who sat out last
season because of elbow surgery, pitched five strong innings at
Pittsburgh to help the Pirates end a six-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 7, Florida 6--Jimmy Rollins scored a career-high four
runs, including the go-ahead run in the 11th inning at Miami on Bobby
Abreu's single.</TE>

<HD>In Sparks' World, No Chance for Mercury</HD>
<DH>WNBA: Mabika scores 20 points to lead Los Angeles to an
89-66 win, the team's 27th consecutive victory at home and its
seventh in a row overall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Western Conference is shaping up as the WNBA's toughest testing
ground, but the Sparks will remain unconcerned as long as Staples
Center is their base of operations.</LD>
<LD>   Home is definitely where the victories are for Los Angeles, which
chalked up its 27th consecutive home win, and seventh straight
overall, by blasting the Phoenix Mercury, 89-66, Tuesday night before
9,698.</LD>
<LD>   Spark guard Mawadi Mabika continued her bid to be chosen for the
All-Star game by scoring 20 points. Lisa Leslie, battling foul
trouble, had 13 points and 12 rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   "We were saying before the game we had yet to play our best game
at home," Mabika said. "We wanted a good one for the fans tonight."</TE>
<TE>   More important, with Houston and Utah refusing to let the Sparks
run away with the regular-season conference race, home wins are
precious.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to take care of business at home," Spark Coach Michael
Cooper said. "And we are very comfortable here.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised with our performance. We came out on the top of
our game. We knew we had to be prepared to play from the beginning or
risk getting beat because they have a good team."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks got the message.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't let anyone just come in your house and show off," said
Latasha Byears, who had 12 points and six rebounds off the bench. "I
know if someone came in my house trying to steal something, it would
get ugly."</TE>
<TE>   Said Leslie: "We knew [Phoenix] has been playing well. But it's
good to be home; we really hear our fans."</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix (6-4) hung in as long as it could but ultimately wilted
midway against a superior team. And it was hard to stay close when
only one player, Gordana Grubin (10 points), reached double figures
in scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Cynthia Cooper had a few sharp words for her team afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to come in this building ready to play because the
Sparks are a great team. And we weren't ready to match their
intensity. I know our veterans weren't ready tonight," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't name names, but the Phoenix coach could have been
referring to starters Lisa Harrison, Jennifer Gillom and Adrain
Williams, who combined for 17 points and made a collective seven of
19 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's loss dropped Phoenix to 0-3 on the road.</TE>
<TE>   After playing their next two games at home--including a rematch
with the Sparks on Friday--the Mercury will have nine of the next 11
games away from America West Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Looking sharp and energized at the outset, the Sparks made 10 of
their first 14 shots and took a 34-14 lead as Phoenix looked dazed
and tentative.</TE>
<TE>   For one of the few times this season the Sparks revved up the
tempo, leaving Phoenix more than a step behind when the Sparks got
the ball in the open court.</TE>
<TE>   But the Mercury whittled the Sparks' lead by outscoring their
hosts, 21-7, over the final 8:26 to trail only 41-35 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix went to a full-court press, causing the Sparks to commit a
rash of turnovers (11) and cutting off their fastbreak.</TE>
<TE>   Eager to rest his starters, Michael Cooper substituted liberally
toward the end of the half, something he admitted was a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to get players in, but we had too many fresh bodies
on the floor at the same time. It was not their fault, it was ours,"
said Michael Cooper, referring to himself and his assistant coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix got as close as four. But a 16-3 run midway through the
second half put the Sparks comfortably ahead, 66-48, and the Mercury
never seriously threatened again.</TE>

<KH>WIMBLEDON NOTES</KH>
<HD>Baltacha Only British Woman Left</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>Not long after Daniela Hantuchova emerged as a legitimate top player
by winning at Indian Wells in March, her coach, Nigel Sears, was
asked: "How did an Englishman come to be coaching a Slovak woman?"</LD>
<LD>   "Well," Sears replied, "have you seen the British women?"</LD>
<LD>   Yes, the British women are a beleaguered lot in women's tennis,
especially at Wimbledon. If Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski figure to be
facing pressure here for two weeks, the expectations of the women
probably will last for no more than a few days ... because usually
they are all eliminated in the first or second round.</LD>
<TE>   This year, there is a first-round survivor.</TE>
<TE>   Wild-card entrant Elena Baltacha defeated qualifier Maria
Vento-Kabchi of Venezuela, 6-4, 6-4, Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Baltacha's countrywoman, Jane O'Donoghue, drew a much tougher
assignment, facing two-time defending champion and top-seeded Venus
Williams, who beat O'Donoghue, 6-1, 6-1, in 45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the British teenager came away thrilled with her Centre
Court experience and felt she had emerged with her dignity intact.</TE>
<TE>   "[Williams] came out and nearly did four aces, so she was quite
loose," said the 19-year-old O'Donoghue, who ranks 344th. "Then I
realized, 'I've got a mountain to climb here.' "</TE>
<TE>   Her sports psychologist had advised viewing Williams in a
different way--as just another opponent--but O'Donoghue would not say
how she interpreted that advice.</TE>
<TE>   TNT analyst Martina Navratilova considered it poor advice.</TE>
<TE>   "That is psychological babble," she said. "Are you going to shrink
[Williams] to 5-6 and pretend you're in Birmingham on Court 13? You
play the ball, you don't play Venus.... Take it to the ball."</TE>
<TE>   That was not the most one-sided match, though. Fourth-seeded
Monica Seles defeated Eva Bes of Spain, 6-0, 6-0, in 37 minutes.
Seles said she was suffering from a virus and was unable to medicate
because of IOC drug rules.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, WTA officials remained upset about the BBC's airing of
Anna Kournikova's contentious interview on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Public relations officials had said Monday that the questions were
too tough.</TE>
<TE>   Georgina Clark, the WTA's vice president of European operations,
met with BBC and All-England Club officials on Tuesday to register a
complaint.</TE>

<HD>Two Basic Questions Dog Bush's Mideast Peace Plan</HD>
<DH>Policy: Are the demands too broad, some ask, and is the
proposal too vague on how to achieve them?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration struggled Tuesday to generate momentum behind
its sweeping new vision for a final Middle East peace, grappling with
tough challenges facing the plan and mixed reaction from some of
those pivotal to the process.</LD>
<LD>   As the administration began charting a new course for the region,
concerns on both sides in the conflict centered on two basic
questions: Is President Bush's vision too ambitious? And for all the
detailed demands, was it too vague about how to achieve them?</LD>
<LD>   The White House made clear Tuesday that the onus is now on the
players in the troubled region--Palestinians, moderate Arabs and the
Israelis--to follow the U.S. initiative with specific actions.</LD>
<TE>   "I laid out the conditions that I thought were necessary. I called
on all parties in the region to assume the proper responsibilities,"
Bush said Tuesday evening in Kananaskis, in the Canadian province of
Alberta, where he was meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien on the eve of a summit of leading industrial nations. The
president will press his plan--and try to overcome some skepticism
about it--in private talks with other leaders at the Group of 8
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer added Tuesday: "If the parties
[in the Middle East] want to find a way out of the violence, they
need to heed his call."</TE>
<TE>   That includes Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. In
his speech, Bush called on the Palestinians to elect new leaders to
help create a Palestinian state over the next three years, a
statement widely interpreted as a call to oust Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said Tuesday that one reason Bush made that move is
that Arafat has maintained direct ties and provided funds to the Al
Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militant faction that claimed responsibility
for a suicide bombing last Wednesday that killed seven Israelis as
Bush was making key decisions on his peace plan.</TE>
<TE>   That involvement "made it fairly clear that the kind of change
that [Secretary of State Colin L.] Powell had told [Arafat] to make a
few months before when they met in Ramallah had not been made," said
an administration official who asked to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli newspaper Maariv reported last week that intelligence
sources had identified a $20,000 payment Arafat had authorized for Al
Aqsa, according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the language in Bush's speech, U.S. officials indicated
Tuesday that to some degree, they are still counting on Arafat to be
part of the process.</TE>
<TE>   "He's currently in a leadership position. We continue to look to
him to take responsibility, to exercise authority and to exercise
leadership," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Nor have contacts with the Palestinian Authority been broken. "We
still have a charge [d'affaires] there, and we are in touch with
different Palestinian leaders as recently as yesterday, before the
president's speech as well as after," Powell said in an interview
Tuesday with Radio Sawa, a U.S.-sponsored Arabic station.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's future was the most contentious issue in reaction
worldwide Tuesday to Bush's plan.</TE>
<TE>   European and Arab governments generally endorsed many of Bush's
ideas on the need to institute massive Palestinian political reforms
and curtail violence as preludes to creation of a new state. But no
nation joined in Bush's implicit call for Arafat's ouster; some even
questioned that interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush's speech includes nothing calling for toppling ... Arafat,
but it rather referred to the need to restructure the Palestinian
National Authority," said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</TE>
<TE>   Britain, America's closest major ally, welcomed the heightened
U.S. involvement in the Middle East peace process.</TE>
<TE>   But Prime Minister Tony Blair echoed Europe's concern about
demanding that Arafat be excluded from a leadership role.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always said it is for the Palestinian people to choose
their own leader," Blair's spokesman told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   After talks with Arafat, who is again besieged in his West Bank
headquarters in Ramallah by Israeli tanks and troops, French Foreign
Minister Dominique de Villepin on Tuesday called Palestinian reforms
"absolutely vital." But he said it is up to the Palestinians alone to
select their leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The reactions and the ongoing contacts between U.S. officials and
current Palestinian leaders underscore one of the basic challenges in
the U.S. initiative: how exactly to proceed with the effort to change
the leadership, the most ambitious aspect of Bush's speech.</TE>
<TE>   Nudging Arafat and his inner circle aside won't be easy. The
Palestinian president Tuesday basically dismissed the notion. Asked
whether he felt targeted by Bush's plan, he replied, "Definitely
not." Pressed on Bush's call for new Palestinian leaders, Arafat
said: "This is what my people will decide. They are the only ones who
can determine this."</TE>
<TE>   Pushing Arafat out also carries risks. Indeed, Arafat's presence
is considered by many to be the only thing that is keeping extremists
from creating greater turmoil in the region--for Palestinians and
Israelis, according to analysts on both sides of the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "There is more than ever a growing perception, and that includes
among senior officials in the Palestinian Authority, that Arafat has
failed, that he must eventually go," said Khalil Shikaki, director of
the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah and
currently a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution think tank in
Washington. "But there is also a realization on their part that if he
leaves at the beginning of the process, the whole system collapses
and the country finds itself in total anarchy."</TE>
<TE>   Shikaki added: "The alternative is going to be militias in the
street, a coalition of radical nationalists and Islamists."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview on National Public Radio on Tuesday, Powell
admitted that new elections Bush called for might keep Arafat in
power. "We will deal with the circumstances as we find them," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A senior State Department official later clarified that Washington
hopes that Arafat will "'work himself out of a job," language
criticized by some analysts in the region as naive.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, in an interview with "CBS Evening News," expressed
confidence that new Palestinian leaders would surface if they
believed that democratic elections would occur and power could be
spread beyond one or two individuals.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned of a different scenario:
The elections could put extremists in power legally.</TE>
<TE>   Some Israelis, meanwhile, said Bush's speech was too vague on the
process for achieving his ends; they warned that it did not create a
vision but potentially a vacuum in which either the status quo will
continue or extremist elements will prosper.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who dreamed that the president's speech would spark new
hope had their dreams dashed," Israel's largest newspaper, Yediot
Aharonot, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush proposed a peace process and buried it with his own words.
Even Arafat's opponents will come to his defense in the face of the
American tyranny."</TE>
<TE>   The core problem, as some Israelis saw it, is that Palestinians
face a list of significant and immediate demands--including a virtual
order to abandon the father of Palestinian nationalism--while rewards
loom years away.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they are like the Portuguese, Spanish or Italian teams at the
World Cup, with one distinction: They had hopes, but suddenly, in the
middle of the game, the referee pulled a red card on their team and
ordered it off the field," Israeli political commentator Hemi Shalev
wrote Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, of course, that the Palestinians are not
embittered European soccer fans, but a violent and desperate people
that expresses its frustration by means of monstrous suicide bombing
attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Others worried that Bush, in essentially embracing the Israeli
government's position that Arafat should not be part of a new peace
process, could embolden Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to
proceed with military actions against the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to recent suicide bombings, Sharon dispatched tanks and
troops across the West Bank, taking over towns and confining hundreds
of thousands of Palestinians to virtual house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not just a green light for Sharon," said one Western
diplomat. "Bush's foot is on the accelerator."</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the Bush administration clearly is just beginning to
sort through what steps it should take to translate the president's
initiative into reality.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that we have a road, we have to develop a road map," the
State Department's Boucher said when asked about implementing the
U.S. plan.</TE>
<TE>   But the lack of specifics on how to proceed sparked questions
Tuesday about the plan's viability--and even why Bush decided to give
the speech before developing a fuller strategy.</TE>

<HD>Angels' Schoeneweis Can't Get Job Done</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>With the sound of Texas Ranger home-run balls rattling off the seats
still ringing in his ears Tuesday night, the last thing Angel
left-hander Scott Schoeneweis wanted to hear was someone asking if he
was concerned about his spot in the rotation.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll have a job somewhere," he told reporters after getting
bombed for eight runs in 4 2/3 innings of an 11-5 Texas victory. "If
it's here, it's here. If it's not, it's not.... [Seattle Mariner
pitcher] Freddy Garcia gave up 10 runs [Monday night]. Is his job in
jeopardy? If I'm not good enough to pitch at this level or pitch
here, it's not going to rule my life. I do everything I'm supposed to
do. The results are just not there all the time."</LD>
<LD>   Schoeneweis ran into a hot Ranger team at The Ballpark in
Arlington and the result was Texas' eighth win in a row and its third
in this series, which still has two games remaining. He gave up only
four hits, but three of those were home runs. Add in his five walks,
and it was a short night for the fourth-year veteran whose record
dropped to 6-6 while his earned-run average rose from 4.83 to 5.38.</LD>
<TE>   In all, the Rangers hit four homers and broke the game open with
an eight-run fifth, the most runs they've scored in an inning and the
most given up by the Angels in an inning this season.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis had the early lead. After losing a doubleheader Monday
night, the Angels struck first on Bengie Molina's three-run,
second-inning double.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the home-run balls, which were hit by:</TE>
<TE>   * Rafael Palmeiro. His 16th of the season in the second inning put
the Rangers on the scoreboard. The ball cleared the center-field
wall, landing 409 feet away. It was the 463rd home run of his career,
breaking a tie for 23rd on the all-time list with Jose Canseco and
Ken Griffey Jr. It was also Palmeiro's 43rd against the Angels, the
most he has hit against any club.</TE>
<TE>   * Ryan Ludwick. His home run, leading off the third, was the
rookie's first in the big leagues.</TE>
<TE>   * Todd Greene. His two-run homer in the fifth inning, his third of
the season, landed in the left-field club level 390 feet away, the
ninth ball ever to land in that section.</TE>
<TE>   Greene's homer tied the score, the Angels having gotten their
fourth run on Adam Kennedy's third-inning RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   But Schoeneweis' problems had just begun. He had walked Kevin
Mench before Greene's home run. He proceeded to walk two more and
surrender a single to Ivan Rodriguez to load the bases. Juan
Gonzalez' sacrifice fly brought home the third run of the inning.
When Schoeneweis issued his fourth walk of the inning to Palmeiro,
Manager Mike Scioscia decided his pitcher had had enough.</TE>
<TE>   In came reliever Lou Pote to fan the flames, walking in one run
and throwing a wild pitch to send another home before Mench added the
coup de grace , a three-run homer, his seventh of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The beneficiary of the Ranger attack was former Dodger and Angel
Ismael Valdes, who gave up four runs in seven innings to improve to
5-6.</TE>
<TE>   "They are my friends," Valdes said of the Angels. "But when I
cross the lines, it is different."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia downplayed any speculation Schoeneweis would lose his
spot in the rotation. At least for now.</TE>
<TE>   "We are always looking to improve the ballclub," he said, "but
right now, nothing is going to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis said he wouldn't look at tape of his performance and
wouldn't let the memory of Tuesday night linger until his next start.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think about the good ones when they are over," he said.
"There have been so many bad ones that I don't think about them
either."</TE>
<TE>   With the successful major league debut Monday of 23-year-old John
Lackey, who held the Rangers to three runs in seven innings and
showed poise and control, the pressure on Schoeneweis figures to
continue.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are going against a good offensive lineup," Scioscia
said, "you put logs on the fire when you walk guys.</TE>
<TE>   "He has made some progress, but we keep waiting for him to put it
together the next game and the next. We know what's inside him, but
he has yet to bring that package in every fifth day."</TE>

<HD>Perez Pulls Another Fast 'One'</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He needs only 1:55 to throw his second one-hitter
of the season. Lo Duca, Karros homer in 4-0 win over Rockies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger left-hander Odalis Perez knocked on history's door again
Tuesday night, but for the second time this season, a no-hitter
remained just on the other side of the threshold, close enough to
touch but too far away to grasp.</LD>
<LD>   Perez threw a complete-game one-hitter with six strikeouts in a
4-0 victory over the Colorado Rockies before 23,635 in Dodger
Stadium, his only blemish Bobby Estalella's soft single over
shortstop Cesar Izturis' head to lead off the sixth inning.</LD>
<LD>   Perez, who needed only 87 pitches--60 strikes--to shut down the
National League's best-hitting and highest-scoring team in 1 hour and
55 minutes, faced 28 batters, one over the minimum.</LD>
<TE>   It was almost a carbon copy of his one-hit shutout of the Chicago
Cubs on April 26, when Perez (9-3) faced the minimum 27 batters and
came within a Corey Patterson seventh-inning, bad-hop infield single
of throwing a perfect game.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point [Tuesday] night, just like in Chicago, it crossed
my mind that I could throw a no-hitter," said Perez, who is 5-0 with
a 2.03 earned-run average in his last six starts and a strong
candidate to make the NL All-Star team.</TE>
<TE>   "Will I ever get one? I'm working on it. If I can get through the
seventh inning with a no-hitter, I'm not going to allow anyone to
break it up."</TE>
<TE>   Perez, 23, does not seem like the no-hitter type. His fastball
tops out at 91 mph, and though he has an excellent slider and
changeup, neither is considered dominating.</TE>
<TE>   But Perez, acquired from the Atlanta Braves in the Gary Sheffield
trade in January, has impeccable control and command, especially
early in the count, when he throws enough quality strikes to induce
plenty of swings but marginal contact.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who has three complete games this season, went to
three-ball counts on only three batters Tuesday night, walking one.
Of Colorado's 28 at-bats, 13 lasted two pitches or less. Perez has
walked 15 in 116 innings this season, the third-best
walks-per-nine-innings percentage in the league.</TE>
<TE>   "One hitter over the minimum is like a slow death," Rocky Manager
Clint Hurdle said. "He's not like Randy Johnson, who rolls over you.
He's like an assassin, who comes quietly and then kills you."</TE>
<TE>   Perez's gem moved the first-place Dodgers 1 1/2 games ahead of
Arizona in the NL West and tied them with the New York Yankees and
Seattle Mariners for the best record in baseball at 47-29.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger right fielder Shawn Green backed Perez with two diving
catches, of Estalella's sinking liner in the third inning and Juan
Uribe's flare in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lo Duca hit a solo home run in the first inning, and Eric
Karros added a two-run homer in the sixth, both off Colorado starter
John Thomson (6-7), providing plenty of offense, and Perez got
himself an insurance run in the eighth when he led off with a double
and scored on Lo Duca's sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   Perez breezed through the first five innings, needing only 48
pitches to blank the Rockies, before Estalella reached out for a 2-2
changeup and got just enough of it to loft it into shallow
left-center.</TE>
<TE>   After Thomson struck out, Juan Pierre hit a slow roller to short.
Izturis charged and made a quick throw to first to nail Pierre, but
Estalella never stopped around second. Karros, the first baseman,
fired to third baseman Adrian Beltre, who applied the tag to complete
an inning-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who has limited opponents to a .207 average (84 for 406),
retired the last nine batters to complete the game.</TE>
<TE>   "That, in my opinion, was an inch or two away from being a
no-hitter," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "The hit Estalella got, it
was definitely the right pitch, it just didn't fade quite enough.
Otherwise, I think he would have struck out."</TE>

<KH>NBA DRAFT TODAY, 4:30 PDT, TNT</KH>
<HD>A Piece of Work</HD>
<DH>No one questions the effort of Dan Gadzuric, but some
wonder if, at 24, the former Bruin can get much better. Still, he
could be a first-round pick.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dan Gadzuric grew up wanting nothing more than to lie flat on his
back with a wrench in his hand as an automobiel werktuigkundige in
Den Haag, Holland.</LD>
<LD>   He would learn to repair engines, become an auto mechanic and
escape the drug- and gang-saturated neighborhood in his roughhewn
oceanfront hometown.</LD>
<LD>   A commendable plan, but one that Gadzuric outgrew. It was clear
there was no creeper in his future the first time he stepped onto a
basketball court at 15, already measuring bumper to bumper.</LD>
<TE>   Learning the game's nuances has been like mastering a second
language, an ongoing and often perplexing challenge. Nine years
later, an uneven career as UCLA's center behind him and an NBA
opportunity just ahead at the relatively advanced age of 24, Gadzuric
remains a work in progress, what the Dutch call a raadsel, an enigma.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he is expected to be drafted today late in the first round
or early in the second because along with the risk comes the gift of
Gad--an enormously athletic and doggedly earnest 6-foot-11 package of
potential.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a wide range of opinions about him," said an NBA scout
who declined to be identified. "Everybody knows he works hard and
some people believe he will improve quite a bit. Others look at his
age and wonder if he'll get much better, no matter how hard he
tries."</TE>
<TE>   With his enormous strides and striking athleticism, Gadzuric was a
childhood phenom on the soccer field, playing on a Dutch national
team with teammates several years older. He was good with his feet,
but soon a 10-foot rim beckoned a more breathtaking feat.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember the first time I dunked the ball really hard," he
said. "It was in my first year. I liked that a lot. It felt good."</TE>
<TE>   The dunks are still coming, but Gadzuric's best attribute is a
blue-collar approach any mechanic could appreciate.</TE>
<TE>   "I work hard on the court every day," he said. "That's all I can
do. I'm still learning this game, I know that, but as long as I give
100% effort, I'll continue to improve."</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric says everything a coach loves to hear, but from him it
somehow sounds genuine. He has been guilty of playing out of control,
of confusing activity with achievement, but never of giving less than
his best.</TE>
<TE>   "He was appreciative and grateful for the opportunity to be here,"
UCLA Coach Steve Lavin said. "He doesn't have the ego or prima donna
qualities of some of the high-level players who grew up in the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   All the fine-tuning had his engine humming the second half of his
senior season. Gadzuric was UCLA's best player down the stretch,
averaging nearly 14 points and nine rebounds in his last 20 games.</TE>
<TE>   He made his biggest adjustment on defense. He blocked only 42
shots as a senior--a drop from the 60 and 52 of the previous two
seasons and a concession to committing fewer fouls and playing more
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   After fouling out of three consecutive games at midseason and
being removed in the first half of several others because of foul
trouble, Gadzuric stopped leaving his feet as opposing players drove
into the lane, instead raising his arms and staying balanced.</TE>
<TE>   The result was fewer blocks, but fewer fouls too--he fouled out
only once in the last 16 games, in the final seconds of a victory at
Stanford he'd dominated with 15 rebounds and 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   "He's learned to play under control, move his feet without lunging
on defense and develop some effective post moves on offense," Lavin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, his senior numbers of 11.4 points and 7.7 rebounds were
below those of his junior year when he averaged 11.7 points and 8.6
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   How much better is he than the day he arrived at UCLA from
Governor Dummer Academy, a private prep school in Byfield, Mass.?</TE>
<TE>   "Dan improved quite a bit, his entire game is better," Bruin
teammate Jason Kapono said. "It's easy to see how he can still
improve, but he is a much better player and understands the game
better than he did a few years ago."</TE>
<TE>   At Governor Dummer, Gadzuric learned to speak English and majored
in elementary basketball, averaging 21 points, 17 rebounds and seven
blocks his senior year. He was a McDonald's All-American and the most
highly sought center in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   And he was already 20, which added to the expectations when he
arrived at Westwood one day before fall classes began in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved L.A. right away because it is like a Mulligan stew, there
is so much cultural diversity, a lot like Den Haag," he said. "I
adjusted pretty fast. I'm proud of that."</TE>
<TE>   On the court, however, the expectations of becoming the next Lew
Alcindor or Bill Walton nearly crushed him. He'd never heard of those
players, but there was no mistaking the boos at Pauley Pavilion. He
couldn't understand why his home court could be as hot as a Dutch
oven.</TE>
<TE>   A knee injury prematurely ended his freshman season, and as a
sophomore he considered quitting after a loss at USC, telling his
coach the game wasn't fun.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he just wanted to go home," Lavin said. "I told him it's
no different with any other player, it's just that you're not as
familiar with America and with UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric responded the next game with a double-double in a victory
over North Carolina. Ups and downs continued. He was scoreless
against Oregon State, then scored 22 points a few days later against
California, and had strong performances in NCAA tournament victories
over Ball State and Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   His junior year was similar, with glimpses of greatness (22 points
and 17 rebounds against Arizona) giving way to struggles (zero points
and two rebounds two days later against Arizona State).</TE>
<TE>   Again he came alive in the tournament, making 14 of 20 shots and
grabbing 27 rebounds in victories over Hofstra and Utah State. He
entertained the idea of leaving for the NBA, but scouts told him
another year of seasoning was necessary, even though he would turn 24
in February.</TE>
<TE>   An ankle injury as a senior slowed his start, then came the foul
trouble and new questions about his progress, or lack thereof. The
strong finish, though, raised his profile with the NBA, an entity he
has given scant attention.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't very often you get a big man who plays as hard as
Gadzuric," said Marty Blake, the NBA director of scouting. "His stock
is high, no doubt. But he's already 24 and is still a long-range
investment."</TE>
<TE>   Scouts have asked about tendinitis in his knees, but Gadzuric said
the concern is overblown.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no problems all season," he said. "I practiced and had no
complaints. I'm not even icing my knees anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his U.S.-bred peers, Gadzuric didn't grow up idolizing NBA
stars. Early in his UCLA career he considered it strange that this
game could be a ticket to unimagined riches.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's getting it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I will do a whole lot better in the NBA because the game
is more physical and I like physicality," he said. "I like to play
real hard and not think about foul trouble."</TE>
<TE>   So the monetary implications of his performance in the second
round of the NCAA tournament against Cincinnati, when he posted 26
points and 13 rebounds, occurred to him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was a breakthrough game," he said. "I showed people I
am a good post player, I can run the floor, I can score. I showed I
can do the rough jobs, posting up the big players."</TE>
<TE>   Bruin fans warmed to Gadzuric in his last home games, chanting,
"Whose house? Dan's house!" and showering him with a loud ovation on
senior day. His parents, Dragosiava Gadzuric and SL Scott, sister
Gloria and former club coach Ben Ponsioen flew in from Holland for
the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents haven't had the chance to see me on a consistent
basis, so it was a special thing," he said. "They saw how my life is
and how I play basketball. They always gave me the freedom of
choosing the path I wanted to take and let me live with the
consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, perhaps, he will reap the rewards. His long-ago decision to
leave his homeland, forget about car engines and take up a strange
game was more than a twist of lotsbestemming. It involved a leap of
geloof.</TE>
<TE>   Fate or faith, he's glad he came to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing what I love and I feel at home here now," he said. "It
was the best move I ever made."</TE>

<HD>Germany Earns 1-Way Ticket</HD>
<DH>World Cup: Plodding style wears down entertaining South
Korean team in semifinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>When it was all over, when the final whistle had sounded and the red
sea had departed, Lee Chun-Soo sank to the turf at midfield and
stared for several long moments at the grass in front of him.</LD>
<LD>   There was nothing to say, nothing to do, nothing on the
scoreboard.</LD>
<LD>   Germany 1, South Korea 0.</LD>
<TE>   The World Cup, a dream image that had floated in front of Lee and
the rest of the Korean soccer players like some sporting grail, had
vanished in one cruel moment, snatched away by a goal from Michael
Ballack.</TE>
<TE>   Germany one, South Korea nothing.</TE>
<TE>   That goal, stabbed home in the 75th minute Tuesday night, cut like
a knife through the heart of Lee, his teammates, the 65,625 fans at
Seoul World Cup Stadium and an entire nation. It was a fatal wound.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea will not be going to Sunday's World Cup final in
Yokohama, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Germany will, and it will play the winner of today's semifinal in
Saitama, Japan, between Brazil and Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   It really shouldn't have ended this way. South Korea was the more
adventurous team, the team that was willing to attack all night, the
team that made the Germans look slow and stolid by comparison.</TE>
<TE>   But the Koreans could not score. They tried for 90 minutes to find
a way to beat German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, but in vain. Kahn has
given up one goal at this World Cup. Once Ballack scored, the
Germans' third consecutive 1-0 victory was all but sealed.</TE>
<TE>   "In modern football, you should be able to beat opponents with
just one goal," defensive midfielder Dietmar Hamann said in a comment
that reflected the Germans' desire to put the result before the
spectacle.</TE>
<TE>   Good for the Germans, bad for the fans.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Pele was looking so glum in the stands. This plodding,
results-only style of soccer is not for him.</TE>
<TE>   "We were quite clearly the better team," said Germany Coach Rudi
Voeller, who won the World Cup as a player in 1990 and has the chance
to become only the third person, after Germany's Franz Beckenbauer
and Brazil's Mario "Lobo" Zagalo, to also win it as a coach.</TE>
<TE>   And so, while the German players celebrated near him, Lee remained
on the ground, contemplating what might have been. South Korea went
further in this tournament than anyone had expected, further than any
Asian team had gone in a World Cup, but not far enough.</TE>
<TE>   The final whistle signaled the end of more than just a match.</TE>
<TE>   Voeller ran over and embraced his South Korean counterpart,
Dutchman Guus Hiddink, whose charisma has captivated a country and
whose astute coaching had carried South Korea to the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to look for any excuses," Hiddink said later, "but
you have to be realistic and say they are a little more experienced,
and you could see that at the end."</TE>
<TE>   It might have simply been a case of the Koreans finally running
out of gas.</TE>
<TE>   "We watched South Korea's matches and realized that they were
losing strength with each game," Kahn said. "In contrast, we have
been building up momentum."</TE>
<TE>   Korean forward Hwang Sun-Hong admitted as much.</TE>
<TE>   "The Korean team just had not recovered from the last match and in
the end we did not have enough energy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Korean players stood at midfield for a while, looking at the
red-clad fans trudging sadly from the stadium. "Be the Reds" no more.
They then walked over to one end of the field, formed a line and
bowed to the fans in thanks. To the "Red Devils," their due.</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink was the last one off the field.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to close them down in the second half, but in general we
showed a little too much respect," he said of the three-time world
champions.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until Ballack took advantage of the Korean defenders'
tiring legs late in the match that Germany finally broke through.</TE>
<TE>   Oliver Neuville sent in a cross from the right wing that slipped
between two defenders and found Ballack unmarked. The German
striker's first-time shot slammed into the chest of Lee Woon-Jae,
South Korea's goalkeeper, but Ballack was in position to smack the
rebound into the open net.</TE>
<TE>   Ballack also had scored the only goal when Germany knocked the
United States out of the tournament, but he will miss Sunday's
championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Four minutes before scoring, Ballack had earned his second yellow
card of the round, for bringing down Lee--the striker, not the
goalkeeper--on the edge of the German penalty area. Voeller termed it
a tactical foul that was unfortunate but necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had not done it, they would have had a man free for a clear
run on goal," a tearful Ballack said. "It was my first foul of the
game. When you are on one yellow card, you do hold back a little, but
that's football.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very bitter feeling. It was a dream to play in a World Cup
final, but that dream has died."</TE>
<TE>   Voeller, a top-level striker himself in his playing days, praised
Ballack's action.</TE>
<TE>   "He sacrificed himself for the victory," Voeller said. "He put
himself at the service of the team and the whole of Germany, a thing
not only myself but the entire country will stand and applaud him
for."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but when the final whistle came the crowd's sympathy was
more with Lee and his teammates, their own World Cup dream finally at
an end.</TE>
<TE>   "We did our best," captain Hong Myung-Bo said. "We are
disappointed about the result, but we have no regrets."</TE>

<HD>McEnroe Accused of Using Steroids</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Ex-wife Tatum O'Neal, who is in rehab, also says
former star used cocaine and marijuana off the court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John McEnroe's ex-wife said the former tennis star used steroids
while playing and dabbled in drugs off the court during their
six-year marriage.</LD>
<LD>   Tatum O'Neal spoke out about McEnroe during an interview with
Barbara Walters for an episode of ABC's "20/20" that will be
broadcast Friday, according to a release from ABC News.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal, an Academy Award-winning actress who is attempting a
comeback, was responding to McEnroe's recently released
autobiography, "You Cannot be Serious." In the book, McEnroe
disparaged their marriage, which ended in 1992.</LD>
<TE>   McEnroe, 43, became notorious for his on-court blowups and tirades
toward umpires, and won seven Grand Slam events in his career while
dominating men's tennis in the 1980s. He is in London to announce
Wimbledon matches for NBC and the BBC and was not available Tuesday
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview that is sure to light up the tabloids in England
the rest of the week, O'Neal said McEnroe used steroids " when he was
coming back after [their second son] Sean was born" in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said she made McEnroe stop taking steroids because "he was
becoming violent." She said McEnroe "would take out all his rage on
me," making her sit in a chair and circling it while sometimes
yelling. O'Neal said she left McEnroe after he "kicked me down the
stairs."</TE>
<TE>   "I never had a plan. I never thought, 'Oh, I've gotta leave this
guy,' " she said. "But he kicked my ... down the stairs. And I
thought, my little 5-year-old's gonna open the door and see his
mother on the floor, with this crazy man yelling over her and I can't
take it anymore and I gotta go and I was about 28."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who has had repeated bouts with drug addiction and is
currently in a rehab program in Los Angeles, said McEnroe used
marijuana and cocaine off the court during their marriage.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement read by his agent, Gary Swain, McEnroe said, "I am
very disappointed in Tatum's statements. I had hoped that after all
these years she would see things more accurately and that she would
share my concern for the welfare of our children."</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe has custody of the couple's three children. McEnroe has
been married to singer Patty Smyth since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, O'Neal, 38, told a British tabloid that McEnroe's book,
which he wrote with James Kaplan, was "all [garbage]."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not true," O'Neal said. "He's a sociopath."</TE>
<TE>   In a September 1992 interview, O'Neal called McEnroe shy,
shrugging off his on-court tantrums.</TE>
<TE>   "John is really much more temperamental in his work than at home,"
O'Neal told Parade magazine. "Privately, he's shy. It's endearing to
me that he keeps something to himself."</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe, who last won a Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open in 1992,
was in Los Angeles on June 15 to promote his book and signed copies
for about 50 people at a book store on Sunset Blvd. McEnroe said he
took a hard look at himself while writing the book.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a fluffy type of portrayal, but warts and all, the bad
and the ugly," McEnroe said at the book signing. "It's not about how
great I am."</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe also mentioned that a few elderly women had driven from
Fresno just to see him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm big with grandmas," he quipped.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to calling tennis matches for NBC, McEnroe hosted the
short-lived ABC quiz show "The Chair," which was canceled in March
after less than two months on the air.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal won an Academy Award as best supporting actress for "Paper
Moon" in 1973. She played a lead role in "The Scoundrel's Wife," a
movie released with little fanfare in March that marked her first
starring role in more than 10 years. In the movie, O'Neal played a
widowed mother in Louisiana who is suspected of aiding enemy forces
during World War II.</TE>

<HD>Someone Will Say Yao, but Will It Be Rockets?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fortunately for everyone involved, the NBA draft is today, providing
an end point to what has turned into gathering chaos.</LD>
<LD>   As Tuesday's endless countdown ebbed into weary night, there were
these developments:</LD>
<LD>   * The Houston Rockets, frustrated at failing to secure a letter of
release from China's basketball federation, were wondering if they
dared go ahead and draft Yao Ming.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, if the Rockets don't take Yao, after multiple trips to
China and months of negotiations, how far will he fall before someone
takes a chance on him?</TE>
<TE>   (How about No. 7, to the desperate New York Knicks, who romanced
Yao for a month, despite having only a 4% chance at him in the
lottery? Of course, if Yao goes there, this will start the David
Stern-Knicks conspiracy talk all over.)</TE>
<TE>   * Meanwhile, the Chicago Bulls, who are counting on getting Jay
Williams in the No. 2 spot, are petrified, fearing the Rockets will
trade the pick to someone who'll steal their point guard of the
future.</TE>
<TE>   * The Clippers and Cleveland Cavaliers seemed close to agreement
on a deal giving the Clippers point guard Andre Miller for their No.
8 and 12 picks and either Lamar Odom, Darius Miles or Corey Maggette
... but after talks that went deep into the night, including a
meeting of Miller, his agent, Lon Babby, and Cavalier owner Gordon
Gund, there was no announcement.</TE>
<TE>   With Gund selling the franchise, Cavalier officials say they
intend to go the Clipper way, stockpiling young players and cutting
their payroll.</TE>
<TE>   This means finding takers for veterans Lamond Murray, Wes Person,
Tyrone Hill and Jumaine Jones. Or as another general manager noted,
"Good luck."</TE>
<TE>   The Cavaliers aren't saying it, but people suspect they're also
thinking of losing 70 games or so and lucking into local phenom
LeBron James in the '03 draft.</TE>
<TE>   The Cavaliers recently were fined $150,000 for letting the high
school junior from nearby Akron work out with them, although, as
Coach John Lucas noted, he had done it before--in Philadelphia when
he let Kobe Bryant practice with the 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   "I would never do anything to try to get up to get a kid,
especially when you have to lose all your games and you have to get
[lottery] balls to pick the kid," Lucas said. "If that was the case,
he'd be playing for another coach."</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Cavaliers wouldn't make that trade.</TE>
<TE>   * Portland's Bob Whitsitt, who loves phenoms, however young and
problematic (Shawn Kemp coming out of high school and Rasheed Wallace
after his turbulent rookie season in Washington), reportedly was
going to trade up, presumably for the 19-year-old, 6-10, 250-pound
Brazilian, Nene Hilario, or Amare Stoudemire, a 6-8, 233-pound high
school senior.</TE>
<TE>   * Then there were the teams--Indiana, Detroit, New Jersey,
Sacramento--considering trading their first-round pick to save money
... or drafting a foreign player they might keep abroad for a year,
to keep their payrolls down.</TE>
<TE>   As it has been more and more, the draft will be dominated by
foreign players and young Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Three international stars--Yao, Hilario and 19-year-old Georgian
Nikoloz Tskitishvili--are expected to go in the lottery, with at
least three more ticketed for the first round. If the Rockets take
Yao, he'll be the first foreign-born player who didn't attend school
in the U.S. to be chosen No. 1 overall.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, the first college senior, Shane Battier, went to
Memphis at No. 5. This spring, only one, Fresno State's Melvin Ely,
even has a chance at the bottom of the lottery.</TE>
<TE>   The 12 other lottery picks are expected to include the three
foreigners, four juniors, three sophomores, a freshman and a prep
player.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Plan Elicits Skepticism Among Arabs</HD>
<DH>Speech: Critics assail what they see as a call for Arafat's
ouster. U.S. allies, such as Egypt, seek a specific strategy for
achieving peace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>One point in President Bush's Middle East speech that had many Arabs
screaming mad Tuesday was his call for a new Palestinian leadership
as a precondition for the creation of a Palestinian state.</LD>
<LD>   "How dare Bush give conditions like this?" asked Farid Zahran,
head of an Egyptian publishing house and organizer of a popular
committee to support the Palestinian uprising. "To change leadership,
how dare he?"</LD>
<LD>   But was Bush, who did not mention Yasser Arafat by name in his
Monday address, actually calling for the Palestinian Authority
president's ouster? Not if you ask Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</LD>
<TE>   "Bush's speech includes nothing calling for toppling Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, but it rather referred to the need to
restructure the Palestinian National Authority," Mubarak said.</TE>
<TE>   When Bush stood in the Rose Garden on Monday and delivered his
long-awaited peace initiative, he tried to outline a way to end 21
months of bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians. But if he
thought that his chief obstacle was overcoming Israeli occupation
forces and Palestinian suicide bombers, the reaction among Arab
nations to his speech illustrated the many different agendas in the
region that he will also have to confront.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, those states that need or want calm in the region, such
as Egypt and Jordan, saw a speech that supported the Palestinians'
right to self-determination. Those states that believe current peace
plans run counter to their national interests, such as Syria, saw
Bush as simply echoing Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   What Bush's speech didn't do, and this was a point that even his
supporters in Arab nations emphasized, was lay out a specific
strategy for achieving peace. The speech provided general markers,
such as calling for a Palestinian state within three years, but none
of the details sought by Arab policymakers.</TE>
<TE>   There is a good deal of skepticism about the Bush plan because it
comes on the heels of the Saudi peace initiative, the
Egyptian-Jordanian peace initiative, the Tenet plan, the Mitchell
plan and the 1993 Oslo accords and the 1991 international peace
conference in Madrid--to name a few of the efforts that have been
trumpeted, only to see the violence continue.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak, for example, said Egypt is hoping for a visit by
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell "to expound how this speech could
be put into force." The Egyptian leader said his nation is open to
helping reform Palestinian institutions, "but we need to see what is
the plan."</TE>
<TE>   The greatest difficulty for Bush will be working out a sequence of
events acceptable to both sides, observers throughout the region say.
Even if Arabs are willing--and many are reluctant--to accept the
conditions Bush placed on the Palestinians for statehood, no one
thinks that they can be fulfilled before an Israeli military
withdrawal. At the least, observers here say, they need to be done
simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   "If he keeps the [preconditions] and says before we do anything
for the Palestinians the violence must stop--while the Palestinian
Authority is surrounded by tanks, while Arafat is a prisoner--who
will do that?" said Taher Masri, a former Jordanian ambassador to the
Arab League. "Nobody will remove Arafat in such a position."</TE>
<TE>   Still, when it came to assessing Bush's remarks, it looked as
though individual agendas set the tone. Syria, for example, has over
the last few months repeatedly made it clear that it does not support
an immediate end to the crisis, at least until its issues--such as
return of the Golan Heights, seized by Israel during the 1967 Middle
East War--are resolved. And reaction in Syria, which Bush singled out
in his speech as harboring Palestinian organizations that Washington
considers terrorists, was heavily critical of the speech.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect the Bush speech to be any good, but I didn't
expect it to be this bad," said Imad Fawzi Shueibi, a political
science professor at the University of Damascus in the Syrian
capital. "It's much worse than I imagined."</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, Jordan and Egypt--the only Arab states to have signed
peace treaties with Israel and two states eager to keep calm their
own populations, which are pro-Palestinian, for internal security
reasons--saw the speech favorably.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush talks about ending occupation, establishing a Palestinian
state, going back to the borders of September 2000, reconstruction of
Palestine, democratization--all these are basic elements that
Palestinians themselves demanded to happen," said Masri, the former
Jordanian ambassador.</TE>
<TE>   In Saudi Arabia, where the government has been trying to walk a
fine line between pushing for a peaceful settlement while not
inflaming strong anti-American, pro-Palestinian sentiments at home,
there was mixed reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush fails to give concrete ME [Middle East] plan," read the
headline in the Arab News, an English-language newspaper based in the
port city of Jidda. The report did, however, strike a balance between
the U.S. president's harsh criticism of the Palestinian leadership
and his demand that Israel stop building settlements in the occupied
territories.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush address, which had been repeatedly delayed as the
violence between Israelis and Palestinians surged, did make a change
in the Palestinian leaders a condition for the U.S. supporting
Palestinian statehood. Though Bush did not identify Arafat by name,
he said: "Peace requires a new and different Palestinian leadership,
so that a Palestinian state can be born. I call on the Palestinian
people to elect new leaders not compromised by terror."</TE>
<TE>   But while saving his harshest words for the Palestinians, he also
laid down conditions for Israel, including a renewed demand that it
stop building settlements in territories occupied during the 1967
war.</TE>
<TE>   By late Tuesday, it appeared that the Arab League would at least
give Bush a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the current consultations among Arab states will
produce a positive Arab stand that will enhance all that is positive
in the speech and lead to the establishment of a state--that is, a
Palestinian state--to which Bush referred and that is the target,"
said Secretary-General Amr Moussa while attending a meeting of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference in Khartoum, Sudan.</TE>

<HD>Arafat Would Probably Win Reelection</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>If the Palestinians held elections today, it is unlikely that they
would kick out their current leadership, as President Bush envisioned
in a speech Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, polls suggest that Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat would win reelection with an overwhelming mandate, extending
his more than 30-year leadership of the Palestinian cause.</LD>
<LD>   And if Arafat were somehow removed from the political arena--if he
died, voluntarily stepped aside or was expelled by the Israelis--free
elections could produce a more radical Palestinian leadership even
less accommodating to Israel's wish.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's prescription for peace in the Middle East as outlined in
the speech calls for the Palestinian people to "elect new leaders,
leaders not compromised by terror," in order to make peace with
Israel. The approach, with its boundless faith in the democratic
process, is classically American, not unlike peace plans championed
by the U.S. in other trouble spots, such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But political pundits here, both Palestinian and Israeli,
maintained Tuesday that Bush's scenario has little chance of ending
the 21-month wave of violence that has claimed about 2,000 lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat will be reelected, no doubt about it. That is the reality
that we have to deal with," said Israeli political columnist Danny
Rubinstein.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Bush's speech, Arafat promised that elections would be
held no later than early 2003. During a meeting Tuesday with French
Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin in the West Bank city of
Ramallah, Arafat confirmed that plans were being drawn up for
presidential and legislative elections in January and municipal
elections in March.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Arafat aide Saeb Erekat said that elections
would be held those months, but that the dates had not been finalized
because of the inability of the Palestinian leadership to meet due to
curfews imposed by the Israeli military in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   'Democratic' Elections</TE>
<TE>   These elections will be "democratic, democratic, democratic,"
Arafat said, speaking with reporters after the meeting with the
French foreign minister. He rejected the suggestion that Bush's call
for new leadership was a personal attack on him--Bush did not mention
Arafat by name in the speech--but stressed that the Palestinian
people alone would pick their leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be decided by my people and no one else," Arafat
declared.</TE>
<TE>   The 72-year-old Arafat has good reason to be cocky about the
prospect of elections. Despite continued grumbling by Palestinians
about their leadership, Arafat has survived nearly four decades as a
guerrilla chief and then an elected Palestinian leader in part by
keeping his potential rivals and successors weak and divided.</TE>
<TE>   The widespread complaints about corruption and mismanagement in
the Palestinian Authority revolve around his aides more than Arafat
himself.</TE>
<TE>   In a poll released this month by the Jerusalem Media &amp;
Communications Center, Palestinian respondents named Arafat as the
most trustworthy Palestinian figure. Asked to name the person they
"trust the most," more than 25% picked Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   His closest rival in the poll, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual
leader of the Islamic movement Hamas, was picked by fewer than 9%.</TE>
<TE>   Polls also raise doubts about the suggestion by Bush that a silent
majority of Palestinians, if given the chance to express itself
honestly in free elections, would reject violence against Israeli
targets.</TE>
<TE>   A survey published Sunday in the Palestinian newspaper Al Hayat al
Jadida found that 60% of respondents supported suicide bombings
within Israel and a stunning 86% supported attacks against Israeli
troops and settlers within the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   And the respected Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey
Research suggested that Arafat's Fatah political faction has
bolstered its popularity because of suicide bombings and other
attacks carried out since December by the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an
armed wing of the movement.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush sees Arafat as tainted by terrorism, many Palestinians
complain that their leader is too accommodating toward Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "They will never find somebody to give the concessions to Israel
already given by Arafat," Khadar Muzini, 25, a fabric salesman in
Gaza, said Tuesday in response to Bush's speech.</TE>
<TE>   "The maximum was already given by Arafat."</TE>
<TE>   Among potential successors to Arafat, longtime deputies such as
Ahmed Korei, better known as Abu Alaa, and Mahmoud Abbas, or Abu
Maazen, are seen as tainted by their deep involvement in the peace
negotiations with Israel that followed the 1993 Oslo accords.</TE>
<TE>   Others--such as Jibril Rajoub, the top Palestinian security
official in the West Bank, and Mohammed Dahlan, his onetime
counterpart in Gaza--have lost ground because of their periodic
efforts to arrest Islamic militants at Arafat's behest.</TE>
<TE>   "If they get rid of Arafat, there will be a more radical
leadership," predicted Isla Jad, an academic in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people pray he will be kicked out so that we can really
fight the Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   The 21-month uprising, or intifada, has bolstered the standing of
militant figures, such as Marwan Barghouti, a Fatah street leader.
Jailed by Israel since mid-April on charges of involvement in suicide
bombings, Barghouti now has a celebrity-like following. Posters with
his picture are plastered around downtown Ramallah, where Arafat has
his headquarters, and there is even a "Free Marwan Barghouti" Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   Militants Gaining</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the Islamic militants, also gaining momentum
because of the struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Because Hamas does not recognize the Palestinian Authority, which
is a creation of the peace process, it did not field candidates in
the last elections, held in 1996, and may not participate in the next
balloting for president and legislature.</TE>
<TE>   But the group is expected to be actively involved in municipal
races and could significantly boost its power through local offices.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday was among those who
questioned the wisdom of holding elections at a time when violence
has fueled the militancy of the public.</TE>
<TE>   "You could find yourself in a situation that the radicals are the
ones that get elected, and it would be the result of a democratic
process, and we have to accept that," Annan said.</TE>
<TE>   Even the logistics of organizing elections could prove difficult,
given the degree to which Israel has clamped down on freedom of
movement in the West Bank in an effort to fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't hold free and democratic elections in the middle of a
war," said Geoffrey Aronson, director of the Foundation for Middle
East Peace in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "People are confined to their houses 23 hours a day. How could
they vote? How could they campaign? This is all pretend."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Mary Curtius in Gaza City contributed to this
report.</TE>

<TE>(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>Top Palestinians</TE>
<TE>Officials who might be in the running to replace Yasser Arafat
as head of the Palestinian Authority:</TE>
<TE>Ahmed Korei, 65, better known as Abu Alaa, is the speaker of the
Palestinian parliament. Under Palestinian law, he would become
acting president if Arafat were suddenly removed or
incapacitated. His political future is thought to be limited by
a serious heart condition.</TE>
<TE>Mahmoud Abbas, 67, also known as Abu Maazen. Arafat's deputy as
head of the Palestine Liberation Organization. A lawyer and
historian, he also was a negotiator during the 1993 Oslo peace
accords. Some Palestinians consider him too conciliatory toward
Israel.</TE>
<TE>Jibril Rajoub, 49, head of Preventive Security forces in the
West Bank. He speaks fluent Hebrew from years spent in Israeli
prison and is considered a moderate and pragmatist.</TE>
<TE>Marwan Barghouti, 42, a West Bank leader of Arafat's Fatah
political faction. Played a prominent role in organizing
anti-Israeli demonstrations. He was arrested by Israel in
mid-April on charges of involvement in terrorist attacks and
remains in jail.</TE>
<TE>Mohammed Dahlan, 41, recently resigned as head of Preventive
Security forces in the Gaza Strip and is expected to become
Arafat's security advisor. He is a powerful figure in Gaza but
is widely criticized for his business interests.</TE>
<TE>Sheik Ahmed Yassin, in his mid-60s, is the spiritual leader of
the Islamic movement Hamas. One of the most popular Palestinian
leaders after Arafat. Unclear whether he would run for office
given that Hamas rejects the Palestinian Authority.</TE>

Fadela Chaib said.</LD>
<LD>   Six similar cases, including five deaths, already had been
reported in the Republic of Congo.</LD>
<TE>   Chaib said people in the infected communities had refused to give
blood to confirm that the disease was Ebola. But experts were fairly
certain it was, she said.</TE>

in a gun battle last week.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing a pair of old rubber shoes, dark glasses and a cap to
partially hide his face, the unidentified man saluted Arroyo when she
handed him the check in a ceremony at the presidential palace.</LD>
<LD>   The man was a courier for the Abu Sayyaf rebels and a bodyguard
for Abu Sabaya. Although the rebel leader's body has not been found,

<HD>Ecuador Assails Cuts in U.S. Aid</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Efforts to prevent a spillover of Colombia's
conflict are at risk, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>QUITO, Ecuador</DL>
<LD>This Andean nation is upset by cuts in U.S. economic assistance that
it says is needed to prevent guerrilla activity and drug trafficking
in Colombia's expanding civil war from spilling over its border.</LD>
<LD>   There have been several incursions by Colombian guerrillas along
the border, including a 15-mile penetration south of the Panamerican
Highway border crossing at Tulcan last year, said Patricio Maldonado,
director of the Northern Border Development Unit, an agency of the
president's office.</LD>
<LD>   "If Colombia is going to become another Vietnam, we don't want
Ecuador to be the next Cambodia," Foreign Minister Heinz Moeller said
in an interview Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Ecuador absorbed a 32.4% cut--the largest percentage of any
country--of combined security and economic aid in February when the
U.S. government reduced its Andean Initiative, a companion program to
the anti-drug Plan Colombia. The program is designed to help
neighboring countries withstand the spillover effects of Colombia's
deepening conflict. Ecuador's aid dropped from $74 million to $50
million.</TE>
<TE>   The percentage cuts were deeper in the portion of the U.S.
assistance earmarked for economic development programs in six
Ecuadorean northern border provinces--key initiatives to attack
social causes of violence and trafficking at their roots. Instead of
$24 million promised for economic aid this year, the U.S. will send
$10 million, a cut that provoked a harsh response from Moeller in a
letter to U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell this spring.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts were announced weeks after Ecuador agreed to take the
politically risky step of permitting the U.S. military to establish a
presence at its Pacific port city of Manta from which to base
surveillance flights over Colombia. Opponents of the U.S. presence
say it will open the country up to reprisals by Colombian guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   "The cuts were a disappointment, and the explanation they gave us
was not enough, especially in a country that has proven to be a loyal
friend and staunch ally in the effort to build a strong democracy and
better standard of living for the poor," Moeller said in the
interview.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. funds for Ecuadorean border development are being matched
by about $50 million from the Inter-American Development Bank,
several European countries and the European Community. Potable water
and infrastructure projects will proceed.</TE>
<TE>   But the nation also feels slighted by the lapse of the 1991 Andean
Trade Preference Pact, which until May gave agricultural products
exported to the U.S. from Ecuador and other Andean nations
preferential duty treatment as a way to encourage farmers and
fishermen to not cultivate or traffic in drugs.</TE>
<TE>   A bill to renew the pact, which would extend lower tariffs to
products including bananas, coffee, chocolate, cut flowers and tuna,
is bogged down in the Senate after the House passed a version late
last year.</TE>
<TE>   The bill has faced stiff opposition from various U.S. and foreign
agricultural interests.</TE>
<TE>   Moeller said the $250-million Ecuadorean flower export industry is
already suffering because the pact has lapsed, making Ecuadorean
roses less competitive.</TE>
<TE>   "The $14 million in U.S. aid cuts meant that several projects in
the planning stage for the 400-mile Ecuador-Colombia border,
including fisheries and sustainable farming, have been deferred,"
Maldonado said. "The feeling is that we are getting the short end of
the stick."</TE>

<HD>Defying Sharon, Hamas Warns of More Blasts</HD>
<DH>Attacks: Group based in the Gaza Strip says suicide
bombings will continue. A day earlier, Israel's leader vowed to
destroy the militants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>Hamas leaders vowed Tuesday that their Islamic movement would
continue suicide attacks on Israelis and dismissed Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon's stated intention to destroy the militant group in its
Gaza Strip stronghold.</LD>
<LD>   A day after Sharon issued his threat and President Bush said
Palestinian statehood can come only after terrorist attacks cease and
Palestinians replace their leadership, the Gaza Strip on Tuesday was
tense but quiet.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to a committee of the Knesset, Israel's parliament,
Sharon elaborated on the pledge he made to his Likud Party on Monday
that he would launch a massive operation in Gaza against Hamas.</LD>
<TE>   He has no intention of reoccupying Gaza, Sharon reportedly said,
but intends to deal a blow to Hamas. His statement was interpreted by
Israeli analysts as meaning that Israel will step up targeted
killings of the militant group's leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli helicopters killed six Palestinians in the southern Gaza
town of Rafah on Monday, and the army later said it had targeted
Yasser Rizik, who was among the dead. Rizik was a senior Hamas
activist in the town.</TE>
<TE>   "We are taking precautions, but we must always take precautions,"
Ismail abu Shanab, a Hamas spokesman, said Tuesday. "What more can
Sharon do to us that he has not already done? The resistance will
continue."</TE>
<TE>   As Abu Shanab spoke in his Gaza City home, Israeli troops
continued search-and-arrest operations throughout the West Bank in
what the army described as counter-terrorism measures.</TE>
<TE>   What Israel has dubbed Operation Determined Path began last week,
after back-to-back suicide bombings in Jerusalem killed 26 Israelis.
Sharon has said troops will remain in the West Bank as long as it
takes to destroy militant groups carrying out such attacks.</TE>
<TE>   As of Tuesday, Israeli soldiers were occupying seven of the eight
major West Bank cities, with Jericho still not held. Palestinians
said four of their policemen were shot dead Tuesday in clashes with
troops in Hebron, where tanks shelled the Palestinian Authority's
headquarters overnight and troops imposed a curfew on residents.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 Palestinians who had sought shelter in the headquarters
surrendered to troops Tuesday morning. The army later said that 20 of
those were wanted militants. In a statement, the army said it
uncovered an explosives laboratory in Hebron and found weapons caches
in other cities.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials have denounced the operation as reimposing
Israeli military control over West Bank territories ceded to the
Palestinians after the 1993 Oslo peace accords. Many Palestinians
said Tuesday that they believed that Bush's speech laying out his
vision of Middle East peace gave Sharon a green light to continue the
military offensive.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Shanab said Hamas is waiting to see whether the speech will
short-circuit the latest attempt by Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat to rein in Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two organizations
that have rejected his demand that militants stop targeting Israelis
inside Israel's pre-1967 borders.</TE>
<TE>   Both groups have taken responsibility for carrying out many of the
suicide bombings that have claimed the lives of hundreds of Israelis
in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the speech makes it much more difficult for Arafat" to
arrest Islamic militants, Abu Shanab said. "The people will not allow
it."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Palestinian police arrested about 15 people in Gaza
linked to Hamas and Islamic Jihad, but Palestinian sources said none
was a significant figure. The security forces later declared that
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder and spiritual leader of Hamas, was
under house arrest. But Yassin's supporters flocked to his modest
home in a poor neighborhood of Gaza City, where they clashed with
police and drove officers away.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Shanab said Bush's speech was so favorable to Israel that it
left Arafat no choice but to abandon any notion of cracking down on
militants.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, if the Palestinian Authority is seen to be stopping this
intifada, arresting Palestinians, nobody among the Palestinians will
accept this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That analysis was challenged by Raji Sourani, director of the
Palestinian Center for Human Rights and a longtime critic of Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech put Arafat on notice, Sourani said, that the
Palestinian leader is fighting for his political life. He will be
forced to arrest militants to demonstrate to the United States and
Israel that he can still exert authority.</TE>
<TE>   "You will see," Sourani said. "Arafat will crack down on the
Islamists." And any serious crackdown, he said, could lead to civil
war among the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   During nearly two years of bloody conflict with Israel, Arafat
appears to have made no serious attempt to rein in militants.
Palestinian analysts in Gaza said a real crackdown would mean
arresting gunmen and not just the political leaders or spokesmen of
Hamas, who have been put under house arrest or briefly incarcerated
by Arafat several times since the Palestinian uprising erupted in
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat now might have the political motivation to confront
militants, but his security forces are in disarray and Palestinians
are boiling mad over both Bush's speech and Israel's latest invasion
of the West Bank, Sourani said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can say now that we will have a Palestinian state in three
years," Sourani said. "A state in three years, but a blood bath in
the coming weeks."</TE>

<HD>Malaysian Premier to Quit in 2003</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, one of Asia's longest-serving
leaders, will hand power to his deputy late next year under a long
transition plan announced Tuesday in hopes of calming nerves shaken
by his sudden attempt to resign last weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling United Malays National Organization said Mahathir, 76,
a shrewd politician who has presided over 21 years of immense change
in Malaysia, had agreed to postpone his retirement plans to ensure a
smooth transfer of power to Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi.</LD>
<LD>   Mahathir shocked Malaysians by saying at a televised party
conference Saturday that he wanted to quit. He agreed to stay after
party elders took him to a back room and begged him not to resign.</LD>
<TE>   Abdullah served as education, defense and foreign minister before
becoming Mahathir's deputy, but he lacks experience in economic
policy.</TE>
<TE>   Investors praised the plan as an orderly transition, but it was
unclear whether the framework would soothe leaders of neighboring
countries who are fretting over the potential for instability in
Muslim-majority Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition politicians were sour on the plan. Kamaruddin Jaafar, a
leader of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, criticized it as "the
longest resignation notice submitted by any leader in the world."</TE>

<HD>Pushtuns Decry Warlordism in Power Structure</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: In the southeast, many citizens feel
underrepresented and unprotected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAMAL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Here in the boulder-strewn mountains that rise like daggers and in
the valleys that have barely a tree or green shrub, newly elected
Afghan President Hamid Karzai and his government face their biggest
test.</LD>
<LD>   The loya jirga, or grand council, that elevated Karzai from
interim leader to the post of transitional president and saw the
naming of a Cabinet is barely over. But a number of people here in
southeastern Afghanistan are already voicing frustration.</LD>
<LD>   "I am disappointed because, in the six months that Karzai was
interim head of the government, he promised to disarm people and get
rid of warlordism, but his words were never put into practice," said
Han Mohammed, who runs a gas station about a five-hour drive south of
Kabul, the capital, on a gravel road in this village. "If he doesn't
take action, he will lose his fame and the people will desert him."</LD>
<TE>   This is Afghanistan's wild southeastern tier, its so-called
Pushtun Belt, a group of provinces that border Pakistan. The area is
dominated by the Pushtun ethnic group, which has long been fiercely
independent.</TE>
<TE>   It is a region that Karzai's government must attend to both
because Pushtuns make up the largest ethnic group in the country and
because they have the capacity to destabilize Afghanistan if they are
not pleased. The Taliban regime was championed in the mid-1990s by
Pushtuns fed up with the chaos caused by warring commanders in the
center of the country.</TE>
<TE>   So far, hardly anyone has been appointed from this region to a
major position in Kabul, with the exception of the former governor of
Paktia, Taj Mohamad Wardak. However, Wardak had lived for 15 years in
Los Angeles until only a few months ago, so many do not view him as a
native.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just a transitional government. This is just for the time
being," said Tela Khan, 40, a shopkeeper in the small village of
Saparai, eager to underscore that Pushtuns will not have to put up
permanently with what he sees as the inferior role assigned to them.
"It is just an 18-month government. Then there will be another loya
jirga, and then power will be equally distributed among all the
[ethnic] groups."</TE>
<TE>   Although relatively little is known in these remote reaches of the
country about what happened at this month's loya jirga, a few key
points--some only partially accurate--have come across. The lack of
reliable information is a byproduct of Afghanistan's extreme poverty
and underdevelopment. There is virtually no television here.
Information is limited to what crackles over the BBC radio's
Pashto-language broadcast in the evenings and to word of mouth.</TE>
<TE>   It is widely believed that Pushtuns were slighted in the
allocation of Cabinet posts and that all the key jobs went to ethnic
Tajiks from the Panjshir Valley in northeastern Afghanistan. It is
also believed that Karzai caved in to the warlords, including them in
his Cabinet and, according to local logic, by doing so augmented
their power.</TE>
<TE>   While it is true that Tajiks from the Panjshir Valley maintained
their grip on some of the most powerful ministries, there also are
Pushtuns and ethnic Hazaras in a number of key posts. Karzai's dance
with the warlords, however, is a dicier matter. It remains to be seen
whether his strategy of attempting to include them in his Cabinet
will loosen their hold on the regions or increase their profile and
ability to wield power.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no benefit to us Pushtuns," said Naeem, a farmer in the
city of Gardez who, like many Afghans, goes by one name. "We were not
given anything in the Cabinet. And Hamid Karzai cannot use his power.
He is just trying to keep the situation in balance. But the fighting
and bombing is finished, so we are very happy about that."</TE>
<TE>   In a nearby pharmacy, a group of men discussing the loya jirga
agreed that security had been better under the Taliban but that the
real problem with the new government is the inclusion of warlords.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a good decision of Karzai's to include the warlords,"
said Nak Mohammed, the pharmacy owner. "When Karzai first took over
the government, he promised he would eliminate warlordism, but he has
not and now they are stronger."</TE>
<TE>   The more educated the person, the more disappointed he or she
seems to feel. Educated people especially had hoped Karzai would
build a Cabinet of professionals rather than making political
choices.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been better to spend all the money they spent on
the loya jirga on rebuilding the country," said Sakhi Mirrullah, an
engineer with CARE, an international nongovernmental organization.
"The loya jirga was an opportunity for Karzai to select experienced
people for his government. Afghanistan needs people with experience
in all fields. We do not need warlords."</TE>
<TE>   Shaping people's views the most, however, is the issue of personal
safety. Notably in the populous Khowst region near the Pakistani
border, law and order appear to have broken down altogether. As a
result, it is difficult for residents to believe that there is a
central government at all. They have a generally good feeling about
Karzai but paid minimal attention to the recent events in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Their lack of interest is hardly surprising. On Monday in the town
of Khowst, the light pop, pop, pop of automatic weapon fire shattered
the sultry afternoon. A man, his dark hair flowing to his shoulders,
stood in a field near the main city hospital and fired at vehicles on
the nearby road. A second man seemed to be firing as well.</TE>
<TE>   Other armed men fired back. Moments later, one of the men was
injured, another captured, the firing stopped, and traffic, which had
come to a standstill, resumed.</TE>
<TE>   According to locals, this was a minor event but emblematic of the
uncertainty in the city. Indeed, all the talk is of shootings, car
thefts kidnappings and killings.</TE>
<TE>   "No. 1, we want safety. Then we can talk about reconstruction and
rebuilding," said Sher Abbad, who works in the Khowst governor's
office.</TE>

<HD>Cultist Sentenced to Death in Tokyo Subway Attack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>A former doomsday cult figure was sentenced to death today for his
involvement in numerous killings, including a nerve gas attack in the
Tokyo subway that killed 12 people and sickened thousands.</LD>
<LD>   Tomomitsu Niimi, former "home affairs minister" of the Aum Supreme
Truth cult, was found guilty in Tokyo District Court of murdering 26
people in seven attacks, including the 1995 subway gassing and the
slaying of a lawyer and his family.</LD>
<LD>   Court official Hideyuki Ito said Niimi has decided to appeal the
case. It was unclear when the next proceedings will begin.</LD>
<TE>   Niimi was given the death sentence by a three-judge panel presided
over by Judge Yujiro Nakatani, Ito said.</TE>
<TE>   Niimi gained notoriety at the start of his trial in 1996 by
refusing to enter pleas and pledging eternal loyalty to Aum guru
Shoko Asahara.</TE>
<TE>   He has since reportedly admitted to all charges against him except
involvement in the subway attack. But he said he was following
Asahara's orders and shouldn't be subject to the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Asahara is charged with directing the subway assault. He has been
on trial since April 1996.</TE>

<HD>Africans Fear Being Overlooked by G-8</HD>
<DH>Summit: After being promised much attention, leaders see
their cause being sidelined by the Mideast and terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CALGARY, Canada</DL>
<LD>Africa has been promised a rare moment in the international spotlight
when leaders of the world's wealthiest nations gather in the Canadian
Rockies today and Thursday. But many Africans fear that their
concerns--and their desperate need for economic help--may be
overshadowed by the West's preoccupation with the Middle East
conflict and the threat of terrorism elsewhere in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Officially, the centerpiece of the summit agenda is still an
undefined "action plan" for Africa. On Thursday, for the first time,
a delegation of African presidents will meet face to face with their
counterparts from the "Group of 8"--the seven leading industrial
democracies and Russia--and plead the case for trade breaks and
massive financial aid for their impoverished continent.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not charity," said Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien,
the summit's host and the chief sponsor of the Africa initiative.
"This is an investment."</LD>
<TE>   But there are many rival claimants for such investment. Since
Sept. 11, the United States and the European Union have been far more
worried by Islamic fundamentalism than by African poverty. Wealthy
nations are already falling short of their $5-billion aid goal for
rebuilding Afghanistan. And the Bush administration recently said it
will seek contributions from Europe and Japan for a proposed
$20-billion subsidy for Russian nuclear disarmament.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders today are expected to discuss counter-terrorism, the
global economy and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   And now, some Africans worry, the G-8 meeting could be consumed
with debate over President Bush's proposal for elections and a
"provisional" state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, criticizing the Bush plan as
premature Tuesday, said it should be discussed by the entire
"quartet" of Middle East intermediaries: the United States, Russia,
the European Union and the United Nations. All are represented at the
leadership level here. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, another key
Middle East player, will also attend the Canadian summit as part of
the African delegation.</TE>
<TE>   "They cannot even stick to their own agenda," said Njoki Njehu, a
Kenyan activist speaking at an anti-G-8 forum here. "Chretien doesn't
want the Africa plan to be upstaged, but maybe the upstaging has
already happened."</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of the summit, Chretien promised publicly that Africa
would not be eclipsed by the Middle East here--"because I'm the
chair." British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President
Jacques Chirac are also publicly committed to the Africa initiative,
and both pledged to increase aid to the continent by 25% or more over
the coming year.</TE>
<TE>   But the African leaders--Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, Olusegun
Obasanjo of Nigeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria, Abdoulaye Wade
of Senegal and Mubarak--have already been told that the G-8 nations
will not jointly commit themselves to the comprehensive aid package
that the Africans once hoped to obtain in Canada. Trade concessions
for Africa, meanwhile, have been almost forgotten amid wrangling
within the industrialized world about steel tariffs and agricultural
subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   "The momentum has abated," said Kwesi Botchwey, a Ghanaian
economist who headed a recent U.N. study of African development
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Even Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, whom Africans once saw as
their champion in elite world councils, made clear before the meeting
that Washington wanted the summit's development agenda broadened
beyond the continent. "I am pleased that the prime minister is
focusing on those needs," he told Canadian interviewers this month,
"but we will also make the case that there are other nations in the
world that have a need for the kinds of funds we are about to make
available."</TE>
<TE>   In statements issued after the two preparatory meetings for the
Alberta summit--finance ministers met this month in Nova Scotia,
while foreign ministers gathered in British Columbia--there was no
specific mention of Africa at all, an omission that alarmed advocates
of aid programs there. Some critics attributed the seeming oversight
to the absence of former Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin,
widely considered the driving intellectual force behind Canada's
African aid agenda, who was unexpectedly dismissed in a domestic
political dispute with Chretien this month.</TE>
<TE>   At the 2001 summit in Genoa, Italy, when globalization and its
critics were preoccupying world leaders, the G-8 had vowed to make
sub-Saharan Africa the focus of its next annual meeting. This was one
area of the planet where democracy and free-market forces had
indisputably failed to spur development. The goal set for sub-Saharan
Africa by governments and aid agencies for the 1990s was 7% economic
growth; instead, the region registered just 3% growth over the past
10 years, barely enough to keep pace with population expansion.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the presidents of Nigeria, South Africa and Senegal
developed an ambitious plan to pump $64 billion into their
impoverished region through private investment, debt relief, trade
breaks and foreign aid--the payoff for a promised crackdown on
corruption and measurable commitments to good government. The
proposal was endorsed by the Organization of African Unity and
embraced even more enthusiastically by Chretien, who as host of the
2002 summit invited the African leaders to present their plan
personally at the Alberta meeting.</TE>
<TE>   But critics in Africa said that without radical changes in U.S.,
Japanese and European trade policies, plus major new aid commitments,
the African plan--dubbed the New Partnership for Africa's
Development--would amount to little more than a continuation of the
painful economic reforms demanded by the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "Africa suffers from a profusion of initiatives and outpourings of
sympathy and so on, but commitments are not always kept," Botchwey
said.</TE>
<TE>   Annan, who will join the five African presidents at the Thursday
summit session, urged the G-8 leaders in a letter this week to
maintain their focus on the region and to deliver on their promises
of substantial aid and trade concessions.</TE>

<HD>Yugoslav Brass Backs Ouster of Army Chief</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Support for new commander comes a day after top
general was fired. He had vowed to fight his dismissal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>Top generals endorsed a new armed forces chief Tuesday, indicating
that they accepted President Vojislav Kostunica's dismissal of the
previous commander and averting a potential power struggle between
the military and the head of state.</LD>
<LD>   Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic had refused to accept his ouster Monday. The
onetime ally of former President Slobodan Milosevic had vowed to
challenge the presidential decree sending him into retirement,
although he promised not to prevent his successor from performing his
duties.</LD>
<LD>   But the decision by more than a dozen generals and admirals to
back Pavkovic's replacement appeared to decisively weaken his chances
of holding on.</LD>
<TE>   Although some senior government leaders criticized the president
for acting unilaterally, the commanders said in a statement that they
were "completely united in supporting" Gen. Branko Krga as chief of
staff of the army.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, state-run television reported that Pavkovic had
handed over his duties to his successor.</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica fired Pavkovic by special decree, saying that he wanted
to ensure "civilian control over the army" and that Pavkovic
"believed that he is above the army and above the state."</TE>
<TE>   But Pavkovic said Kostunica had no authority to fire him.</TE>
<TE>   Appointed by Milosevic, Pavkovic led the army during its 1999
confrontation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. But he
later played a key part in the overthrow of Milosevic in October
2000, when he refused to use force against pro-democracy leaders and
demonstrators.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Says It Inflated Books by $3.9 Billion</HD>
<DH>Telecom: An internal audit by MCI's parent uncovers
accounting irregularities. The disclosure may force the firm to file
for bankruptcy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN and JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc., the long-distance giant already embroiled in scandal,
disclosed Tuesday that it substantially inflated profit for more than
a year by improperly accounting for more than $3.9 billion in routine
expenses, a revelation expected to force the firm into filing for
bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   A WorldCom filing would rank as the largest corporate bankruptcy
case in U.S. history and leave creditors with nearly $30 billion in
bad debt.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure of what could be one of the biggest financial
frauds seems certain to be another huge blow to investors' confidence
in Wall Street and corporate America after the flurry of scandals
this year.</LD>
<TE>   "You get the feeling that people have not finished lifting up
rocks and finding all the worms," said Henry Hu, a securities law
professor at the University of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, parent company of MCI, also said Tuesday that it would
begin laying off 17,000 workers this week, continuing a retrenchment
that began last year.</TE>
<TE>   The irregularities were discovered during an internal audit,
WorldCom said. The firm informed the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which already was investigating other aspects of the
company's accounting.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's board fired Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan.
Controller David Myers resigned.</TE>
<TE>   "This clearly qualifies for financial fraud," said Alex Mou, a
telecom analyst with Hotovec, Pomeranz &amp; Co. in San Francisco. "What
it tells you is all the statements the company made in the past
basically become a lie."</TE>
<TE>   The accounting maneuvers masked the financial troubles that
engulfed the entire telecommunications industry amid a plunge in
sales as the economy slowed.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in the first quarter of 2001, WorldCom began labeling
some of its routine expenses as capital expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   By classifying normal expenses as long-term capital expenditures,
WorldCom, which had revenue of $35 billion last year, avoided having
to deduct the expenses as a cost of doing business. The result was a
massive overstatement of net income, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   The improper transfers totaled $3.06 billion in 2001, with an
additional $797 million in the first quarter of 2002. Had WorldCom
reported its expenses properly, the company said it would have had a
net loss for 2001 and the first quarter of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom previously said it earned $1.4 billion in 2001 and $130
million in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really, really shocking, really mind-boggling," said
analyst Patrick Comack of Guzman &amp; Co. in Miami. "This could damage
overall investor psychology. It would be just like another Enron."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC, in a statement late Tuesday, said the WorldCom
disclosures "confirm that accounting improprieties of unprecedented
magnitude have been committed in the public markets." The agency said
the cases "demonstrate the need for comprehensive market regulatory
reforms."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom and Enron Corp., the discredited energy trader now mired
in the largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history, shared the same
auditor: Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Andersen told WorldCom that its audit reports for 2001
and 2002 "could not be relied upon," the company said. WorldCom
recently replaced Andersen with KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   "Our work for WorldCom complied with SEC and professional
standards at all times," Andersen said in a statement. "It is of
great concern that important information about line costs was
withheld from Andersen auditors by the chief financial officer of
WorldCom."</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure comes at a critical time for WorldCom, which is
struggling to rebuild since the departure in April of its longtime
chief executive, Bernard J. Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   After building the Clinton, Miss.-based firm into the nation's No.
2 long-distance company through two decades of mergers, Ebbers was
forced out over concerns about declining revenue, mushrooming debt
and questionable accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Tuesday whether Ebbers was aware of the improper
accounting. Ebbers and CFO Sullivan were close colleagues at
WorldCom, with adjoining offices.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts described Ebbers as a particularly hands-on chief
executive. "I think Bernie knows the business cold," Mou said.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Our senior management team is shocked by these discoveries," said
John W. Sidgmore, who replaced Ebbers as CEO. "We are committed to
operating WorldCom in accordance with the highest ethical standards.
I want to assure our customers and employees that the company remains
viable and committed to a long-term future."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom has said it did not engage in revenue-enhancing
accounting practices that have plagued competitors such as Global
Crossing Ltd., which has filed for bankruptcy protection, and
troubled Qwest Communications Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC has been looking at other accounting issues and such
issues as selective disclosure of financial information, improper
commissions and huge loans to Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   For Sidgmore, the task of turning around WorldCom is now much more
difficult, if not impossible. His most pressing concern is the
company's $29.3 billion in long-term debt, which analysts estimate is
greater than the true value of WorldCom's assets.</TE>
<TE>   Except for MCI, WorldCom has no large, attractive assets it could
sell to pay off its debt.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be hard for WorldCom to avoid bankruptcy now," Comack said.
Lenders will be reluctant to give WorldCom money it needs to operate,
he and other analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's bankruptcy filing in December involved total corporate
assets of $50 billion. By contrast, WorldCom listed assets of $104
billion as of March 31.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom provides voice, data and Internet services for commercial
clients worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The MCI group provides local and long-distance services to about
20 million residential and small-business customers in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore insisted that WorldCom's customers would suffer no loss
of service. "Our services are in no way affected by this matter, and
our dedication to meeting customer needs remains unwavering," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts predicted that the company's customers--especially
its lucrative corporate clients--would be vulnerable to poaching by
AT&amp;T Corp. and Sprint Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street has been rocked by financial restatements by major
companies in recent months, belying the boom times many firms
purported to have enjoyed in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Other recent restatements have been the result of stepped-up SEC
investigations of Fortune 500 companies, including Qwest
Communications and Xerox. Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest last week ousted its chief executive amid speculation that
an SEC investigation would force the telecommunications company to
restate revenue for 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Xerox agreed to restate financial results from 1997 to
2001 and pay a record $10-million SEC fine to settle allegations of
premature booking of more than $2 billion in equipment-leasing
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Until the WorldCom announcement Tuesday, the largest earnings
restatement in U.S. corporate history came from Rite Aid Corp., which
overstated net income by $1.6 billion in the late 1990s. Several
former Rite Aid executives were indicted last week.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom shares, which on Monday fell below $1 a share, fell 8
cents to 83 cents in regular Nasdaq trading Tuesday. When rumors of
the accounting restatement hit the market after regular trading
ended, WorldCom shares dived to 35 cents in after-hours trading.</TE>

<HD>Tapping Into Jews' Fears</HD>
<DH>Zionist Morton Klein--once seen as an extremist--is winning
support for his hard-line view of Palestinians, even among U.S.
liberals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Morton Klein is telling a group of Reform Jews--among American
Jewry's more liberal members--how much Palestinians hate them. He
carries plenty of ammunition.</LD>
<LD>   The bearded, bespectacled Jewish leader holds up Palestinian maps
of the Holy Land that do not name Israel--proof, he says, that they
do not accept the existence of the Jewish state.</LD>
<LD>   Klein claims Palestinian textbooks depict Jews as odious killers
of Christians and Muslims. He waves fliers reportedly posted at
hundreds of Palestinian schools in 1996 praising a suicide bomber as
"our hero" and depicting a cracked Star of David, rivulets of blood
streaming out.</LD>
<TE>   "The culture that Arabs have created and promoted is no different
than Nazi Germany," said Klein, president of the Zionist Organization
of America, the nation's oldest pro-Israel group, founded in 1897 to
work for establishment of a Jewish state. The Arab goal, he tells the
crowd, is to "get people to murder Jews."</TE>
<TE>   Until the current outbreak of Mideast violence began 21 months
ago, most American Jews dismissed Klein as a fear monger--a
provocateur against peaceful relationships with Palestinians. Back
then, the vast majority of American Jews supported terms negotiated
in Oslo to give Palestinians land in exchange for peace. In that
pursuit, Jews seemed willing to suspend suspicions of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Not any more. Once hopeful for peace, many now say their optimism
was misplaced, their trust in Arafat irredeemably shattered and their
faith in the Oslo process proven wrong. And nothing symbolizes this
shift more dramatically than the fact that the once-vilified Klein is
now basking in what he sees as vindication.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, he says, his organization has increased its
membership by several thousand. Klein, 54, says he is besieged by
requests for speaking engagements, such as his recent address to
Reform Jews at Stephen S. Wise Temple in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Morton Klein, unfortunately, can pound his chest and say, 'I told
you so,' " said Rabbi Lawrence Goldmark, former president of the
Board of Rabbis of Southern California. "But so many of us sadly are
agreeing with him--if only for today."</TE>
<TE>   David N. Myers, a professor of Jewish history at UCLA, says Klein
and others have tapped into what he called "a deeply felt historical
memory of persecution" that has abruptly and spectacularly reemerged
among many Jews. Despite American Jews' attainment of unparalleled
economic success and social acceptance, he said, the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, rising anti-Semitism in Europe and the relentless
suicide bombings in Israel have rekindled a sense of collective
vulnerability.</TE>
<TE>   The Passover suicide bombing in March was a psychological
milestone. As a suicide bomber detonated himself at a Seder dinner of
hundreds of people in the Israeli coastal resort of Netanya, Myers
said, Jews worldwide were reading in their Haggada, or Passover
liturgical book, the warning that every generation would bring forth
a new enemy to try to destroy the Jewish people.</TE>
<TE>   To Jews, he said, the Passover bombing "highlighted the fear that
the enemy has returned."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent forum on the Mideast at Chabad of Greater Los Feliz,
one man who described himself as a secular Jew and political liberal
put it this way: "After the Passover bombing, I turned to my wife and
said, 'That's it!' I was electrified, because I knew that we had
turned that corner. I'm really happy [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel]
Sharon finally said, 'Enough is enough.' People are trying to kill
us."</TE>
<TE>   Not all Jews have closed ranks. A national network of American
Jews supporting an end to the Israeli occupation and the
establishment of a Palestinian state was recently launched.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Myers, among others, bemoans what he calls the
"mainstreaming of Morton Klein." Pressure to present a "united
front," he says, is having harsh consequences for any dissenting
Jewish voice.</TE>
<TE>   The growing sentiment has led to boycott threats against even the
Jewish Journal, a Los Angeles weekly newspaper, for carrying ads from
a Jewish peace group. Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller of UCLA, who has led
efforts to bring Jews and Muslims together, was recently accused by
writer Avi Davis of justifying the murder of Jews and aiding Israel's
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Since World War II, being against Jews "has had a very charged
implication.... Your reputation can be ruined," said J.J. Goldberg,
editor of the Jewish Forward newspaper in New York. "So there ought
to be a premium on Jewish civility. Phrases like anti-Israel and
anti-Semitism should be used with caution, but they're not."</TE>
<TE>   No Apologies</TE>
<TE>   Klein makes no apologies. At Stephen Wise temple, he tells the
crowd that Muslim religious leaders in the Mideast preach sermons
advocating the torture of Jews. He draws gasps when he says Arabs are
blaming Israeli security forces for secretly plotting the suicide
bombings to make them look bad.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to prove his assertions, Klein produced 29 pages of news
clippings from the Jerusalem Post, an Israeli newspaper, and other
sources. He also cited Israeli translations of Muslim sermons.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Palestinian-Israeli debate knows few accepted
truths. Israelis have one set of facts, one narrative, and
Palestinians another. Within the context of that Israeli narrative,
Klein relentlessly promotes the theme of Palestinian treachery.</TE>
<TE>   Quoting Winston Churchill, as he frequently does in his talks,
Klein throws out thunderous warnings like a modern-day Hebrew
prophet: "Those who appease the crocodile," he said, "will simply be
eaten last."</TE>
<TE>   His remarks draw applause and shouts of "Amen!" Shirley Rosenberg,
a Westlake Village resident who used to support the Oslo accords,
says she now thinks Klein is "absolutely right" in opposing a
Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a smattering of people who don't like him because they
think he's too hard-line," said Harvey Erlich, another former Oslo
supporter who runs a food-distribution business in West Los Angeles.
"But all he does is recount the facts."</TE>
<TE>   In one-on-one encounters, Klein's hard-line public image is belied
by a disarming personal courtliness and self-deprecating humor.</TE>
<TE>   Until a decade ago, Klein says, he was not particularly interested
in Jewish or Israeli affairs, despite his own family's dramatic
personal history. He was born in a displaced persons camp in Germany
after his father, an Orthodox rabbi, survived Auschwitz by dint of
his carpentry skills.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up in a poor section of South Philadelphia, where his
father served as rabbi at a small synagogue. In 1969, he graduated
with degrees in math and economics from Temple University in
Philadelphia, then earned a master's degree in biostatistics. He grew
his hair long, he says, demonstrated against the Vietnam War and
volunteered to work for Democratic Sen. George McGovern's 1972
presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Klein taught high school math, then worked as a health economist
in the Nixon, Ford and Carter administrations. In the mid-1970s, he
became a consultant for two decades to Linus Pauling, the two-time
Nobel Prize-winning scientist. Klein's scientific claim to fame
includes front-page headlines for a 1992 study that demonstrated that
daily doses of 300 to 500 milligrams of vitamin C could reduce heart
problems by 40%.</TE>
<TE>   He began falling away from Judaism, he says, during college. Once
he hit Washington in 1973, he dated non-Jewish women and even
remembers eating on Yom Kippur--albeit with guilty thoughts of how
miserable his father would be if he knew.</TE>
<TE>   Klein's transformation into a Jewish activist began in the early
1990s, when he says he became aware of a "media bias" against Israel.
Beginning in 1991, he began campaigning to correct errors about
Israel in travel guides and textbooks, such as claims that the Jewish
state started the 1967 Mideast War without provocation while failing
to mention Egypt's closure of the Suez Canal and ejection of United
Nations peacekeepers.</TE>
<TE>   He began drawing national headlines in the Jewish press. By then
he had married a Jewish woman and had begun returning to traditional
religious life. In 1993, he ran for president of the Zionist
Organization of America, which claims 40,000 members, and won.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran for one reason: Oslo," Klein said. He says he believed the
historic negotiations to give Palestinians a state in exchange for
assurances of peace was "a historic error and would lead to disaster"
for Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Klein says his Jewish activist work was deeply influenced by his
association with Pauling. "I'm not interested in your fantasies about
experiments," he said Pauling would tell him. "I'm interested in one
thing: What do the data require me to believe?"</TE>
<TE>   Klein contends the data showed Arafat could not be trusted. Citing
translations showing Arafat speaking peace in English but advocating
holy war in Arabic, Klein charged that the Palestinian leader was not
complying with the Olso accords, which required an end to
anti-Semitic propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   He Sees a Ploy</TE>
<TE>   The peace process, Klein said, was a Trojan horse, a ploy by the
Palestinians to placate Israel before attempting to destroy it.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble was, Klein says, few would listen.</TE>
<TE>   Peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians were
advancing. Optimism was high. In 1994, the Nobel Peace Prize was
awarded to Arafat and then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to every major Jewish leader with the [Arafat data],
saying, 'We have to do something,' " Klein said. "I was told: 'These
are just words. They're not important.' "</TE>
<TE>   In an acrimonious dispute a few years ago, he criticized the
Anti-Defamation League for inviting as keynote speaker Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist Thomas Friedman--a man Klein faulted for
criticizing then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
hard-line policies. In a letter, Klein told ADL national President
Abraham Foxman that he should not give a platform to such a "hostile"
critic of Israel. Foxman released the letter and condemned Klein as
an "attack dog of the thought police."</TE>
<TE>   David Lehrer, who was the ADL's Los Angeles director at the time,
calls Klein's actions in the Friedman affair "dangerous nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   "Vilifying someone you disagree with is inimical to civil
dialogue," Lehrer said. "It reflects an obstinacy and rigidity that I
think is just wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Klein also criticized other Jewish policymakers, including the
Clinton administration's then-Mideast negotiators Dennis Ross, Martin
Indyk and Aaron Miller, for ignoring what he called Arafat's
pro-terror actions.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Klein led a campaign against Claremont McKenna College
professor John Roth's nomination as research director for the
Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Klein cited a 1988 opinion
piece in the Los Angeles Times by Roth that noted the desire of some
Israelis to rid themselves of Palestinians in the context of the 50th
anniversary of Kristallnacht, the Nazi roundup of Jews and torching
of synagogues.</TE>
<TE>   Roth subsequently apologized in a Jewish newspaper for the
article, saying he never meant to create an impression that the two
situations were comparable. Klein objected to other Roth writings,
and Roth ultimately withdrew his nomination for the museum post.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Defended</TE>
<TE>   Holocaust expert Michael Berenbaum says that Roth is a gifted and
scholarly friend of Israel, and that Klein made him out to be an
extremist. Klein "has introduced, sanctioned and legitimized a
coarseness of vocabulary and an ugliness of discourse that is a
disastrous contribution to American Jewish life," said Berenbaum, who
plans to join the ethics center of the University of Judaism in Los
Angeles this fall.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Klein campaigned to kill the nomination of Los Angeles
Muslim leader Salam Al-Marayati to a national counter-terrorism
commission. Klein charged Al-Marayati justified Arab terrorism--a
claim denied by Al-Marayati, who says he has repeatedly condemned
violence against innocent civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "His style is to discriminate and exclude people by smear
tactics," Al-Marayati said. "If he's becoming more acceptable as part
of the Jewish mainstream, this is a troubling sign for democracy and
a threat to it."</TE>
<TE>   Klein's supporters describe him as a welcome "wake-up call," in
the words of Orthodox Rabbi David Eliezrie, president of the
Rabbinical Council of Orange County. Like Klein, Eliezrie now finds
himself transformed from the Jewish margins to the mainstream in his
opposition to the Oslo accords.</TE>
<TE>   "Mort deserves a tremendous amount of credit for standing up in
the face of ostracism and criticism and living through it and
fighting on," said Phil Rosen of New York-based American Friends of
Likud, Israel's conservative political party.</TE>
<TE>   Klein regards himself merely as part of Jewish pluralism. "That's
what being in Jewish political life is all about," he said. "Why
can't we talk about these things?"</TE>
<TE>   He says he is an equal-opportunity critic, taking on people not
because of their race, culture or faith, but because of their policy
positions. "I don't care if the entire Supreme Court is Muslim, as
long as they're fair," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He seems amused by the furor and modest about his vindication.
"This had nothing to do with genius or vision," he said. "It just had
to do with looking at the facts."</TE>

<HD>Deaths of 6 Reignite Border Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>PINE VALLEY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Authorities on Tuesday were calling an accident that killed six
people and injured 16 one of the most horrific collisions arising
from the daily struggle of illegal immigrants trying to evade the
U.S. Border Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   Five suspected illegal immigrants and a 50-year-old male citizen
from Albuquerque were killed instantly about 9 p.m. Monday when a
"load van" stuffed with 33 people struck four oncoming vehicles on
Interstate 8 about 50 miles east of downtown San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   The collision immediately rekindled debate about immigrant
smuggling and whether U.S. border policy is contributing to the death
toll as immigrants resort to ever riskier routes and stratagems to
enter the country.</LD>
<TE>   Although vehicle accidents account for only a small fraction of
the overall death toll, the number of immigrants dying in their
attempt to reach the United States has increased sharply in recent
years as the federal government has tightened its control over
less-risky routes near the San Ysidro border crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Moments before Monday's accident, the van was speeding west in the
eastbound lanes with headlights off in an apparent attempt to avoid a
Border Patrol checkpoint, California Highway Patrol officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Having looped around the checkpoint, the driver may have been
trying to return to the westbound lanes when disaster stuck.</TE>
<TE>   The 1994 Dodge van--designed to accommodate only 15
passengers--first sideswiped a 1989 Honda Prelude driven by Mary K.
Miner, 29, of Boulevard, a community in eastern San Diego County, and
a 1996 Honda Accord driven by Sarah J. Kay, 20, of Santa Cruz.
Neither woman suffered serious injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Then the van slammed head-on into a 1993 Ford Explorer driven by
Larry S. Baca, 50, of Albuquerque. The Explorer became airborne,
jumped a guardrail and tumbled down a sharp embankment, landing
upside down. Baca was killed instantly.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the van hit another vehicle head-on--a 1989 Toyota van
driven by Maria F. Amaya, 45, of Boulevard. She was hospitalized in
serious condition. There were no skid marks on the pavement,
suggesting that the crashes occurred too fast for the drivers to
react along the dark stretch of highway, two lanes in each direction
separated by a wide planted median.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-one people were taken to eight San Diego area hospitals.
Sixteen continued to receive treatment Tuesday; three were in
critical condition. Those from the Dodge van who were treated and
released were taken into custody by the Border Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   None of the immigrants killed--four men and one woman--carried
identification, which is hampering attempts by the county medical
examiner to determine names and notify relatives. Their ages were
estimated to range from 25 to 35.</TE>
<TE>   Amaya and her 18-year-old son were returning home after receiving
treatment for injuries caused by an earlier traffic accident,
according to Eileen Cornish, spokeswoman for Sharp Memorial Hospital
in San Diego. Amaya, the last to be struck, had tried to swerve but
did not have time to miss the Dodge van, Cornish added.</TE>
<TE>   CHP investigators believe that the driver of the Dodge van--who
was among the dead--had used an emergency turnout to cross from the
westbound to eastbound lanes about a mile east of the Border Patrol
checkpoint. The collision occurred about a mile west of the
checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Tangled cars and bodies were strewn across both eastbound lanes,
shutting the freeway for hours. Emergency vehicles returning from a
brush fire in the back country were diverted to help with the
injured.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, shards of glass, twisted metal and a scattering of
personal papers, music cassettes and picnic ware were all that
remained at the scene. Baca's Explorer had been removed but a T-shirt
sealed in a plastic bag, a golf club and one white tennis shoe
remained where the sport utility vehicle had come to rest.</TE>
<TE>   Standing at the entrance to Sharp Memorial, where three Mexican
citizens were being treated, a Mexican consular official laid much of
the blame for the accident on smugglers. Most of the immigrants were
from Mexico, some from Brazil and others from Central America,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The migrants "are trying to come across the border looking for
opportunity," said Juan Carlos Sanchez. "But it's the smugglers who
are definitely putting people at risk of dying. It's organized
business. Those people are just merchandise to them."</TE>
<TE>   But Claudia Smith, director of the border project of the
Oceanside-based office of the California Rural Legal Assistance
Foundation, said the U.S. crackdown on the border, dubbed Operation
Gatekeeper, also shares the blame by forcing immigrants away from
easier and safer routes.</TE>
<TE>   "These deaths are entirely foreseeable," she said. "We're sitting
on the border of hypocrisy. We have made smugglers indispensable.
What do you expect? People are going to continue to come here, and
the smugglers are the only way to get across."</TE>
<TE>   Ben Seeley of the San Diego-based Border Solutions Task Force,
which has called for an even tougher approach to illegal immigration,
disagreed sharply.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tragedy that never had to happen," Seeley said. "Until
we get the border sealed off and until the checkpoints work like
they're supposed to, it's going to happen. Smugglers have no regard
for human life."</TE>
<TE>   Although there has been a series of crashes on I-8 involving load
vans packed with illegal immigrants in recent years, two factors
often present do not seem to have played a part in Monday night's
crash.</TE>
<TE>   First, while some accidents have been attributed to vans' picking
up speed on steep hills and going out of control, this crash occurred
on a relatively flat portion of the freeway. Tom Nipper, spokesman
for the California Department of Transportation, blamed the driver.
"No way we can engineer the highway against a problem like that," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Second, there is no indication that the van was being chased or
even followed by the Border Patrol or California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   "This was just somebody who decided to drive westbound in an
eastbound lane with their lights out," said Border Patrol Agent James
Jacques. Immigrants, he said, "are ignorant about what awaits them
when they try to cross" the border.</TE>
<TE>   "They have no idea that these smugglers are giving them a death
sentence."</TE>
<TE>   The number of immigrants killed making the trek northward has
increased in recent years, with heat exhaustion being the most common
cause. In the San Diego area, 134 immigrants died attempting to cross
in 2001 and 140 in 2000; of those, 35 are listed as having died from
car accidents and other non-heat-related causes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, eight illegal immigrants died and 19 were injured when
their vehicle tumbled into a ditch on a rural road near Temecula
while being trailed by a Border Patrol agent. Later that year two
people were killed and 19 injured when a load van hit a Border Patrol
van and careered off Interstate 8 east of San Diego.</TE>

<HD>Capital Mixes Signals for Amtrak</HD>
<DH>Transportation: The White House warns that it cannot
continue subsidies for the railway. But some Democrats oppose a
shutdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- When it comes to funding highways, runways and even
subways, politicians start from a consensus that the transportation
system must keep moving.</LD>
<LD>   That's not the case with Amtrak.</LD>
<LD>   Even if the Bush administration delivers on its promise to avert a
shutdown by providing federal guarantees for emergency loans, the
national passenger rail corporation will remain on the verge of
becoming another railroad relic.</LD>
<TE>   The reason is fundamental: Although the interstates and the air
traffic control system are considered public infrastructure, Amtrak
had been expected to wean itself of federal operating subsidies by
the end of this year. It's evident that won't happen now.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak loses $1.05 for every $1 it makes in revenue. To cover its
losses, it went on a late-1990s borrowing spree that piled up $4
billion in debt, including a $300-million mortgage on New York's Penn
Station. Amtrak ridership, while growing, has not kept pace with
internal goals.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Mead, inspector general of the Transportation Department,
said Amtrak cannot keep operating if its cash flow problems continue
to mount. "If this is the case, Amtrak will be back before Congress
next summer in a similar situation asking for additional funds," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, Amtrak's president announced that any decision on
shutting down the system will be postponed until July 4 or 5, citing
progress by the administration and in Congress to secure $200 million
in emergency financing.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak is also asking the Bush administration for $1.2 billion for
the coming fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, more than twice as much as
the White House wants to spend.</TE>
<TE>   The administration and powerful Democrats in Congress remain at
odds over the future of the passenger rail system.</TE>
<TE>   Bush favors pushing Amtrak toward the free market and partnership
with the states, breaking it into smaller regional units and opening
choice routes to private competition.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats want to infuse Amtrak with a steady appropriation of
cash, arguing that the goal of turning it into a profitable system
was unrealistic from the start.</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the middle are Amtrak's 23,400 employees and roughly
64,000 daily riders, more than half of whom travel on the Northeast
Corridor between Washington and Boston. Hundreds of thousands of rail
commuters on both coasts, whose trains depend on Amtrak support
services, could also face at least temporary disruptions if there is
a shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Amtrak survives, several interstate trains serving
California are likely targets for cancellation. Among them are the
Coast Starlight, between Los Angeles and Seattle, and the California
Zephyr, linking Chicago and the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   However, California also is a model of what a reformed Amtrak
might look like. The state has invested heavily in commuter rail and
intercity routes that now carry more daily riders within California
than Amtrak does nationally.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is hoping to convince other states to do
likewise.</TE>
<TE>   What could save Amtrak is a compromise over its long-term future.</TE>
<TE>   The administration would finally have to accept Amtrak as a
legitimate part of the public infrastructure and agree to continue
federal subsidies, probably at higher levels than it would like.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, meanwhile, would have to accept a restructuring that
eliminates cherished routes. The vehicle for such an agreement would
be legislation, now pending in Congress, to set a new government
policy for Amtrak.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta says he is committed to
preserving intercity passenger train service, but he adds that Amtrak
must undergo radical change.</TE>
<TE>   "Amtrak's current route network provides too many services with
limited market appeal at high operating costs to the federal
government," Mineta said. "The country can ill afford to throw
billions of federal dollars at Amtrak and just hope its problems
disappear."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats in Congress bristle at such language from Mineta, a
former colleague serving a GOP administration. They have roundly
condemned Bush's program as a "non-starter."</TE>
<TE>   "From the outset, Amtrak has been on a starvation diet," said Rep.
James L. Oberstar (D-Minn). "No nation in the world has successfully
operated intercity passenger trains on a for-profit basis."</TE>
<TE>   As for the Bush plan, "it was not worth the wait," Oberstar said.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that the administration and the Democrats agree on is
that Amtrak is finally under capable management. David Gunn, a
veteran manager with a reputation for reviving dying public transit
systems, was coaxed out of retirement in Canada to take over at
Amtrak in April.</TE>
<TE>   "I have run larger organizations than Amtrak, but I do not recall
in nearly 40 years of service taking the reins of a company with such
immediate and significant problems," Gunn said. "When you have to
mortgage your busiest station just to make payroll, you are only a
step or two before the precipice."</TE>
<TE>   Gunn's credits include turning around the New York and
Philadelphia public transit systems and running Washington's Metro
subway system.</TE>
<TE>   Among the problems he said he found at Amtrak was a company with
85 vice presidents, many with titles such as "senior" and
"executive." The budget "was a document based on unrealistic
assumptions."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, one in 15 cars were out of service because Amtrak has
postponed needed maintenance and repairs.</TE>
<TE>   "The company made bad decisions while pursuing an impossible goal
of self-sufficiency mandated by Congress," Gunn said. "Despite these
problems, Amtrak and the service it provides are well worth saving."</TE>
<TE>   Defining himself as a traditional transit manager, Gunn said he
opposes privatization. "Most of our trains lose money and they always
will, but we can run them more efficiently," he said. "That is an
achievable goal."</TE>
<TE>   Gunn said the administration has been pushing Amtrak to raise
about half of the $200 million in emergency funding on its own, even
floating a proposal to mortgage Chicago's Union Station. That and
most of the other proposals have turned out to be impractical, he
said. But Mineta has not pressed him to cut any routes for now.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, long-distance passenger rail service was operated by
independent businesses. But with the privately run system facing
economic extinction, Congress established Amtrak in 1970 as a
for-profit corporation. It has not had a profitable year in the three
decades since.</TE>
<TE>   Even service in the Northeast Corridor, where Amtrak owns the
rails and the trains, loses money.</TE>
<TE>   Privatization would not be a cost-free option. An analysis earlier
this year by the Transportation Department inspector general's office
concluded that buyers would balk at the high cost of long-neglected
improvements to Amtrak's infrastructure. For example, the Northeast
Corridor--Amtrak's most attractive asset--needs $15 billion in
long-term capital improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "Few investors would find it a good bargain," said Mead, the
inspector general. "For the Northeast Corridor to become marketable,
the capital needs must first be addressed, which leads us back to the
funding question already on the table: How much will it cost, who
pays, and how?"</TE>

<HD>Blood Banks Appeal for Donations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NERISSA PACIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. blood bank and public health leaders have issued a national
appeal for blood donations in the face of shortages that have left
some parts of the country in a state of emergency, with less than a
one-day supply.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly half of the regions supplied by American Red Cross Blood
Services and a third of the blood banks supplied by America's Blood
Centers are suffering from shortages, accounting for half of the
nation's blood suppliers, the Red Cross Blood Services said.</LD>
<LD>   The East and Southeast have been hit the hardest by the shortage,
said Dr. Ross Herron, medical director for the American Red Cross
Blood Services Southern California Region. But because the region
imports more than 45% of its blood from out-of-state centers, the
scarcity could mean shortages at local hospitals supplied largely by
the Red Cross in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties.</LD>
<TE>   "Our supplies are OK right now, but we don't collect enough blood
here to be self-sufficient," Herron said.</TE>
<TE>   Although supplies were high after Sept. 11, the blood donated at
that time has either been transfused or expired. Red blood cells last
42 days and platelets are good for only five days. On average, 34,000
units of red blood cells, or about 34,000 pints, are needed per day
for patients in the U.S., according to the American Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   The demand for blood now outpaces supply as medical procedures
become more sophisticated and aging baby-boomers undergo more
surgeries, Herron said.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors said shortages typically occur during holidays or summer
months when donors are on vacation and when schools, where many blood
drives take place, aren't in full session.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't have blood, you can't treat patients," said Dr.
Janice Nelson, medical director of transfusion medicine at Los
Angeles County-USC Medical Center. "By virtue of the fact that the
rest of the nation is declaring shortages, I'm cautious that the
impact on us may be imminent."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush has signed a bill allowing death benefits to be paid
to domestic partners of firefighters and police officers who die in
the line of duty, permanently extending a federal death benefit to
same-sex couples for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   The bill allows a $250,000 federal benefit for public safety
officers' survivors to be paid to any beneficiary listed on the
victim's life insurance policy. The money is now available only to
spouses, children and parents.</LD>
<LD>   Gay activists had lobbied for the bill and the Justice Department
had objected to it, saying in a letter to Congress that the benefit
had been designed for immediate survivors with pressing needs and
that the bill was "likely to create unintended and unfortunate
results."</LD>

<LD>Choosing safety over schedule, NASA has grounded the space shuttle
fleet while engineers try to determine why tiny cracks are developing
in the fuel line feeding the main rocket engines.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement put a crimp in NASA's efforts to satisfy a tight
schedule for building and supplying the international space station.
Solving the problem could take weeks or more.</LD>
<LD>   NASA engineers said they aren't even sure that the space shuttle
problem is a threat to safety. They found minuscule cracks in the
metal liner of fuel lines that carry supercold hydrogen to the main
rocket engines. What caused the cracks and the extent of threat they
represent are unanswered questions, a NASA spokesman said.</LD>

succeed retired Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weakland.</LD>
<LD>   Pope John Paul II accepted Weakland's resignation May 24, a day

allegation against himself.</LD>
<LD>   Dolan, 52, served five years as secretary to two papal delegates

<HD>Bush Tells Congress of Urgency to Pass Hike in Debt Limit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush, struggling to break a fiscal logjam,
urged Democratic and Republican leaders Tuesday to put aside
political posturing and pass a crucial bill to increase the legal
limit for the federal debt.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's letter is the latest, most pointed warning from the
administration that if the debt-limit increase is not approved by the
end of the week, the government risks an unprecedented default on
payments to holders of government bonds.</LD>
<LD>   But the debt-limit bill is caught in a morass of partisan
squabbles that are symptomatic of a broader disarray in Congress on
fiscal matters this year. Appropriation bills are moving slowly
because Congress, for only the second time in decades, could not
agree on an overall government spending target. Long-standing tools
for enforcing budget limits are about to lapse. And lawmakers have
taken months to pass an ''emergency'' spending bill for
anti-terrorism initiatives that enjoy broad bipartisan support.</LD>
<TE>   The most pressing issue is Bush's seven-month-old request for an
increase in the $5.95-trillion limit on government's borrowing
authority to accommodate the growing budget deficit. In a letter he
sent Tuesday to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), Bush urged them to give
bipartisan approval to the debt hike--just as the Senate managed to
do two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   ''I am writing to ask that the bipartisan cooperation you have
shown in our war against terror and creation of a new Department of
Homeland Security be extended to another important priority:
Maintaining the full faith and credit of the United States
Government,'' Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   But economic issues have always been harder for the two parties to
cooperate on. Even after last year's recession was worsened by the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a bitterly divided Congress took months
to craft an economic aid package.</TE>
<TE>   The debt issue is particularly thorny for House GOP conservatives,
who pride themselves on running the government with a keen eye on the
bottom line. They fear political fallout from their constituents if
they vote for a debt-limit increase.</TE>
<TE>   Given the likelihood of conservative defections on the issue,
House Republican leaders claim they could not pass a debt-limit
increase on an up-or-down vote unless Democrats lend some support.</TE>
<TE>   But House Democrats are adamant that Republicans take
responsibility--and the political heat--for raising the debt limit
because it is needed, in part, to pay for the tax cut the Bush
administration pushed through Congress last year. They are forcing
the confrontation to underscore a key Democratic campaign theme: That
the tax cut has left the federal budget a shambles.</TE>
<TE>   So with Democrats unwilling to help, Republicans have tried
instead to slip a debt-limit hike into the anti-terrorism emergency
spending bill. That way, conservatives could avoid a vote solely on
the debt issue. But the spending bill is stalled, in part because
Democrats want to thwart the GOP strategy.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of congressional action, Treasury Secretary Paul H.
O'Neill has resorted to a number of accounting gimmicks, such as
borrowing from government retirement funds, to avoid bumping up
against the debt limit. But he now says that he has run out of tricks
and that Congress must act before Friday, when the government must
certify a round of Social Security checks and other big payments.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) on Tuesday suggested
that Congress might leave for a weeklong Independence Day recess
without breaking the impasse. He said lawmakers may face enough
criticism for inaction when they go home that they would return more
willing to vote for the hike.</TE>

<HD>Answers Elusive in 1965 Slaying</HD>
<DH>Crime: FBI is again trying to find out who ambushed two
black deputies in Louisiana.</DH>
<SE>Second in an occasional series.</SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>VARNADO, La.--The two deputies drove quietly down Main Street,
crossed the railroad tracks and headed home for a late dinner. It was
not yet midnight on June 2, 1965.</LD>
<LD>   Alongside came a dark pickup with a Confederate flag decal on the
front bumper, a driver, maybe one man with a firearm at the passenger
window, maybe two men with firearms in the back of the truck.</LD>
<LD>   Oneal Moore was killed instantly, the back of his head blown out
by a bullet from a high-powered hunting rifle. Creed Rogers was
wounded in the shoulder by shotgun pellets and blinded in his right
eye.</LD>
<TE>   They were the community's first black deputies, on duty for a year
and a day, sworn in by a sheriff hoping to accommodate the rising
impatience of local blacks for more jobs and more respect. But it
angered much of the white power structure in Washington Parish,
particularly the influential chapter of the Ku Klux Klan.</TE>
<TE>   No one stood trial in the ambush, no one went to prison, and
today, nearly 40 years later, no one in this rural Louisiana
community has come forward with any solid evidence that might bring
the gunmen to justice.</TE>
<TE>   Yet everyone seems to think they know at least one of them. Ernest
Ray McElveen, then 41, of nearby Bogalusa, was charged with murder,
briefly held and then released when friends put up $25,000 bail. For
reasons that remain unclear, the case was never prosecuted and the
charges were dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Every 10 years or so, it seems, federal or local law enforcement
authorities reopen the case.</TE>
<TE>   People can recall at least two grand jury investigations. Once,
authorities dug up a concrete patio after being tipped that the
firearms used in the shootings were buried underneath. Another time a
woman with cancer told authorities on her deathbed that her boyfriend
had whispered in her ear that he was one of the killers.</TE>
<TE>   When the name of yet another alleged accomplice surfaced, the man
claimed amnesia because of a car wreck 12 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing came of any of this, as has been true in countless efforts
over the years to reopen unsolved, race-driven murders from the
1960s.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, there have been successes, raising hopes in other
old civil rights cases. Just last month, Bobby Frank Cherry was
convicted for his role in a Birmingham, Ala., church bombing that
killed four black girls nearly 40 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   At least 11 other such cases, including the shootings of Varnado's
two black deputies, are alive across the South. But there are
countless other unsolved killings of blacks from that era that are
doomed to remain forever below the radar of young prosecutors or
others with an interest in justice. Indeed, the life span of
prospective witnesses is fast expiring.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the handful of old cases that are being revived appears
to have slim prospects for successful prosecution, plagued by the
damage time does to evidence. The reopening of these old cases might
serve mainly to remind Americans of the fragility of justice.</TE>
<TE>   Now the case of Oneal Moore and Creed Rogers has been reopened
again, this time by the FBI field office in New Orleans. Though they
will not say what sparked the new interest, agents felt optimistic
enough to announce a $40,000 reward for information. Green-and-white
reward posters are being hung in some of the shop windows and in
government offices around Washington Parish, and a fresh crop of
investigators is knocking on doors, hoping to pry loose a clue or
two.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got some leads and we're covering those leads," said FBI
Agent Dave Picard, who handles civil rights cases in Louisiana.
"We're hoping something will shake here. I'm hoping we'll get some
kind of lead where somebody will come forward late in life."</TE>
<TE>   But that seems unlikely, given how Washington Parish has managed
to live with its secret for so long. Some shop owners won't even put
up the reward posters.</TE>
<TE>   Varnado sits in the northeast corner of Washington Parish, a
lumber and paper mill town just off the Pearl River where Louisiana
meets Mississippi, an hour north of New Orleans. The hamlet is still
little more than a mix of gas stations, a beauty salon, a takeout
pizza place and a smattering of churches. The old Gulf, Mobile &amp; Ohio
railroad tracks, now the Illinois Central Railroad, still cut through
town.</TE>
<TE>   It is not a community where new ideas readily take hold. As soon
as the case was reopened, Moore's widow, Maevella, got another death
threat. Even Rogers, now 80, who with a glass eye went on to complete
a long career as a local deputy, said: "I've pretty well learned not
to think about it too much anymore. I've made up my mind I'm never
going to find out who did this to us."</TE>
<TE>   Said Frank Sass, a retired FBI agent who worked the case at the
time: "You're whistling in the dark about anything to do with that
case now. I just don't think it will go anywhere. Once McElveen and
everybody else stopped talking, this whole thing came to a screeching
halt."</TE>
<TE>   'Klan's Bloody Answer'</TE>
<TE>   They buried Moore a week after the shooting, on a stifling hot
June afternoon, the New Zion Missionary Baptist Church so chock-full
of mourners that those who could not fit inside gathered under
spreading trees in the churchyard. He was married in that church, and
he sang in the choir.</TE>
<TE>   Seven women fainted at the funeral, including the widow, the
newspapers reported. "I can't go on without him," she cried. Her four
daughters, the oldest 9, the youngest 9 months, sat silently up
front.</TE>
<TE>   When the mourners marched with the coffin down Jones Creek Road to
the black cemetery, a sudden rain and hailstorm drenched them.</TE>
<TE>   The streets were flooded in Bogalusa, Washington Parish's largest
city, seven miles south of Varnado, where that evening the black
activist James Farmer, national director of the Congress of Racial
Equality, spoke at a rally. He proclaimed that the shooting was "the
Klan's bloody answer" to a local voters' league request that more
blacks be hired as law enforcement officers.</TE>
<TE>   He was speaking to the true believers. Black residents in
Washington Parish for some time had been agitating for a greater role
in their community: more jobs, fair housing, equal rights.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks leading to the shooting, they had staged rallies and
marches, demanding that public facilities be desegregated. A large
force of state troopers was brought in to quell any disturbances and
try to keep the demonstrators safe. By the time the two officers were
shot that night, about 50 whites had been rounded up for attacking or
harassing blacks.</TE>
<TE>   The local Ku Klux Klan was a potent force, so entrenched that many
members seldom bothered to hide beneath hoods. Indeed, that year a
Georgia congressman addressed the U.S. House of Representatives and
named several hundred white men in Washington Parish that court
records indicated belonged to the Klan or other white supremacy
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ku Klux Klan uses three basic techniques: secrecy, terror and
intimidation," said Rep. Charles L. Weltner, a white Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   The Klan and members of the ultraconservative Anti-Communist
Christian Assn. were particularly enraged at the sight of two black
men in deputy uniforms, driving around the parish in a county patrol
car. They denounced the white sheriff and accused him of "selling
out."</TE>
<TE>   Lou Major Jr., today the white publisher of the community's
largest newspaper, the Daily News, a job he inherited from his
father, can sometimes still feel the tension from those days.</TE>
<TE>   "The Klan was pretty active," he recalled. "They did quite a bit
of cross burning in front of our newspaper. I can think of four that
were burned at my dad's home too. The radio station, which happened
to be owned by a Jewish man for a time, it got hit."</TE>
<TE>   A Klan rally a month after the shooting drew 10,000 whites down to
the riverfront, no small gathering for Bogalusa, population 26,000.
They burned three crosses, and 50 Klan leaders paraded, not all in
hoods and robes. Half a dozen speeches fired up the night.</TE>
<TE>   "Look how far we've come now," Grand Titan Saxon Farmer of
Bogalusa told the crowd, boasting of the Klan's growth in Washington
Parish in recent years. Before, he said, "it was just me and the man
they're now charging with murder of the Negro deputy sheriff."</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana's governor at the time, John McKeithen, a white man,
came to Bogalusa and announced a $25,000 reward for information
leading to the arrest of anyone else responsible for the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to catch them," the governor vowed. "We're going to
catch them all."</TE>
<TE>   An Unsure Witness</TE>
<TE>   Daniel R. "Scrap" Fornea had just gotten home and was climbing the
front porch steps when the patrol car drove by. He saw the pickup
coming up behind it too, like it wanted to pass, and--he wasn't
sure--but "there could have been five, two, or one person in it. I
just don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Then he heard the gunfire. "Louder than an M-1," recalled the
former soldier.</TE>
<TE>   He ran to where the patrol car had smashed into a tree. Deputy
Moore lay dead, his body straddled over his partner. Deputy Rogers
was making frantic radio calls to the dispatcher, describing the
truck and the Rebel flag on the bumper.</TE>
<TE>   "That's about all I know," Fornea recalled. "Except we thought of
them deputies as good Negroes."</TE>
<TE>   The deputies had been headed to Moore's home for a late dinner of
fried catfish that Maevella was preparing. They were diverted at the
last minute by a report of a suspicious brush fire. It might well
have been a ruse, because moments later they were shot, every window
of their cruiser blown out.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, McElveen, a paper mill employee and insurance
salesman, a respected member of the community who was active in white
power groups, was pulled over in Tylertown, Miss., an hour's drive
from the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   He was driving a black 1954 pickup with a Confederate decal on the
front bumper. He was carrying two pistols, and in his pockets were
four identification cards. He belonged to the Citizens Council, the
National States Rights Party and a group identified as the National
Riflemen's Assn. He also was an honorary special agent for the
Louisiana State Police.</TE>
<TE>   But the police did not find a rifle or a shotgun. And McElveen was
not talking. Many townspeople in Louisiana recognized him as an
upstanding neighbor, a tall, lanky World War II veteran who was
active in veterans affairs and community fund drives.</TE>
<TE>   He was booked, held overnight in the Mississippi jail and
extradited to Louisiana. There, Sheriff Dorman Crowe signaled that
more arrests were sure to follow. "You can't shoot a high-powered
rifle and a shotgun and drive a pickup truck at the same time," the
sheriff said.</TE>
<TE>   At the parish jail, all the guards could get out of him was that
he had been at a campsite near the state line and then had driven to
Tylertown for treatment of a back injury.</TE>
<TE>   He was charged with murder on the strength of the truck
identification. He said he was innocent, and a coroner's jury
convened. But it determined only that Moore died "by gunshot wound."</TE>
<TE>   Several days after his arrest, McElveen was set free when friends
came up with the $25,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   A white judge, a white prosecutor and McElveen's white attorney
agreed that it was unfair to keep the prisoner behind bars
indefinitely because the only real witness, Rogers, was in a New
Orleans hospital and might not be coming home soon to testify. He
might not ever see again, either.</TE>
<TE>   Why no one was tried is unclear. Court records reveal little. The
sheriff, the prosecutor and the judge are dead. The defense attorney,
Ossie Brown of Baton Rouge, now retired, did not return repeated
phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Theirs was a tightly run, white-dominated community, as described
by Rep. Weltner in his speech before Congress. He said the Klan and
other white supremacy groups were ensconced around Bogalusa. He said
the Klan had members in the police and fire departments, at the
housing authority, connections to the mayor's office, and that even a
city judge had a brother who wore the Klan robes.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, recalled Sass, the former FBI agent, there was
concern that McElveen would be "taken care of" once he was placed in
the hands of authorities in Louisiana. That is why the FBI was called
in.</TE>
<TE>   Sass was home in bed in New Orleans when he got the call about the
shooting. He monitored how local officials handled civil rights
cases. He hustled up to Washington Parish, but McElveen had already
hired a lawyer and was refusing to talk.</TE>
<TE>   "If we in the bureau could have gotten to McElveen before they
turned him over to Louisiana, we might have gotten something out of
him," Sass said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   He said he and other FBI agents tried to interview other suspects
but came away empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   "They were all provided alibis, for themselves and everybody else
they knew," Sass said. "With the political structure at that time,
everyone was leaning in favor of the poor Klansmen."</TE>
<TE>   Today McElveen, 78, is seen around Washington Parish, often
shopping in downtown Bogalusa. He still is not talking.</TE>
<TE>   "Nope, no comment," he said good-naturedly enough, when recently
asked about the shooting. "No comment. Not a thing. I just don't have
anything to say. Goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   Some around town say that the old white structure still exists.</TE>
<TE>   "The KKK is alive and well here," said Lee Kelley, who until
recently ran a local alternative newspaper and print shop. She said
she lost her business after raising questions about the 1965
shooting. She said she received threats and was snubbed by many of
her customers.</TE>
<TE>   "They've traded in their hoods and ropes for navy blue suits," she
complained about many of the older white people in the community.
"But they are just as manipulative now. They undercut you financially
instead of burning a cross on your grass."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some shop owners who were asked to put up the reward
posters did not want to stir up the old memories, or had other
reasons for not getting involved. "People around town are probably
afraid," said Marilyn Bateman at the Bogalusa Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Varnado Mayor Paris Sumrall said: "This community is largely still
made up of the old-timers. There's not a lot of new blood. Most
people my age, I'm 41, have moved away, and the old people want to
let it alone. The consensus of the community is to let it lie."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Maevella Moore says she is receiving threats again.</TE>
<TE>   When they reopened the case this time, her phone rang and the
caller instructed her to drive over the Pearl River Bridge "if you
really want to know who killed your husband." And, the voice added,
"I hope you don't get killed before you get over there."</TE>
<TE>   She thought about that phone call for a moment, then said, "You
hate it, but what can you do about it?"</TE>

<HD>Top 'Soft-Money' Donor Does It 'Under the Radar'</HD>
<DH>Politics: Steven Kirsch's millions boosted coffers of state
parties, study of campaign 2000 shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the three years since Steven T. Kirsch sold his dot-com startup,
Infoseek, for hundreds of millions of dollars, the Los Angeles native
has donated millions to the causes of nuclear disarmament, clean air,
major-disease cures and even the protection of Earth from asteroids.</LD>
<LD>   Among Kirsch's top crusades: campaign-finance reform, a cause that
his charitable foundation says it has funded with nearly $1 million
in donations to nonpartisan groups that are fighting to purge
American politics of the corruptive influence of billions of dollars
in "soft money," which is the unlimited, unregulated contributions to
political parties--not to specific candidates--from corporations,
unions and wealthy individuals.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, the 45-year-old entrepreneur emerged at the top of a
list of soft-money contributors--a "stealth" donor who quietly
funneled $2.1 million meant to defeat George W. Bush through nine
separate state Democratic committees only days before the November
2000 election.</LD>
<TE>   "So I was No. 1? Cool," Kirsch said Tuesday in a telephone in-
terview from his Silicon Valley home.</TE>
<TE>   While federal law bans unlimited contributions to specific
candidates, the tactic of using state parties and soft money to
influence federal elections is sanctioned by a loophole that has
become the focus of the debate over campaign finance reform. It was
specifically targeted by the landmark Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act
that Congress passed this year.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say new loopholes were opened Saturday when the
Federal Election Commission amended the law with a series of
regulations that permitted broader activities by state committees.
Tuesday, three reform groups criticized that action as they released
a list of top state-level soft-money donors.</TE>
<TE>   The donor list was part of an unprecedented yearlong investigation
into the flow of soft money at the state level during the last
presidential elections. Entitled "State Secrets: A Joint
Investigation of Political Party Money in the States," the study
found that nearly half of the $570 million in soft money raised in
2000 by state Democratic and Republican committees was actually
funneled through or directed by national political party committees,
a practice that will remain legal until the campaign law takes effect
in November.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those contributions specifically targeted swing
states--such as Florida--where the election would be decided,
according to the study, which was based on about 30,000 pages of
documents from all 50 states that were examined by 32 researchers
from the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity, the Center for
Responsive Politics and the National Institute on Money in State
Politics.</TE>
<TE>   And those swing states were precisely what Kirsch was trying to
target, he said, reflecting deeply held views that Republicans give
far more to their party than Democrats, that genuine campaign-finance
reform is the only ultimate solution, and that, in the meantime,
Democrats should use their millions to balance the scales.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Kirsch, who drives an electric car, lives in a
$10-million all-digital house and funds an array of causes ranging
from the Sept. 11 attack victims to long-term hospice care,
symbolizes the push-pull contradictions and ironies in the debate
about campaign-finance reform.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he contributed $50,000 to one of the groups that singled
him out for criticism Tuesday, the Center for Public Integrity. The
report disclosed the donation in a footnote that asserted "Kirsch was
not known as a major political donor" when the center sought and took
the contribution in 2000--the same year Kirsch gave a total of $3
million in soft money to state and candidate committees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great irony," the center's director, Charles Lewis, said
of Kirsch's history of funding campaign finance reform groups and his
sudden emergence as a big-time financier--a leap so rapid that Lewis
said Kirsch "went from zero to 200 mph in just a few days or a few
months."</TE>
<TE>   "We have a stealth process here in the 21st century where you
can't see who's doing what [at the state level], and that's the irony
to me of what Kirsch has done," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   The joint report added that what Kirsch did in the 2000 campaign
was emblematic of the soft-money problem. Specifically, it documented
that Kirsch had "spread $2.1 million in six-figure chunks among nine
different state Democratic Party committees, virtually all in key
swing states in the 2000 presidential elections"--none of them in his
home state of California.</TE>
<TE>   "By spreading his contributions around, Kirsch was able to come in
'under the radar,' according to one former elections official, and
avoid the type of scrutiny endured by people who make big donations
to the national parties," the report says. There are no limits on
soft contributions, but Kirsch was able to avoid publicity by giving
smaller amounts to a number of states.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no intention at all to fly under the radar," said
Kirsch, who is reportedly worth $400 million and who now runs a
high-tech San Jose start-up, Propel Software Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, I had a finite amount of money to spend, and I went
on the Web to identify the states where the deployment of that money
was going to make the most difference in the outcome of the last
presidential election," he said. He conceded that the Democratic
National Committee also advised him where his money would be most
effective in defeating George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "My objective was not to make the Top 10 list. My objective was, I
had a capacity to give and to make a positive difference ... in this
case, to elect the best president for the United States." Despite the
limits on contributions to specific candidates, a series of rulings
by the FEC and the courts beginning in the early 1970s have opened a
loophole in election law through which both state and national
parties can raise unlimited, unregulated funds for "non-federal
election activity."</TE>
<TE>   As the loophole widened and the millions of soft dollars
multiplied in recent years, those activities have grown from
traditional "get-out-the-vote" drives to include "issue" advertising
and other events that critics say have given the best-endowed special
interests inordinate influence on federal politics and policies.</TE>
<TE>   In practice, the study released Tuesday found that the state
parties have become a largely unmonitored "back door" for vast
amounts of money that do, in fact, strongly influence federal
elections; Florida, where the last presidential election was decided,
topped the list of states receiving the most soft money--almost $27
million--from national party committees.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders of the three reform groups noted that the campaign
finance reform act, which takes effect Nov. 6, the day after this
year's elections, permits state party committees to continue to raise
soft money. But they stressed that regulations added by the FEC
through amendments to the reform law last week undo key restrictions
in the law and are likely to expand exponentially the soft-money
loophole the law was meant to close.</TE>
<TE>   Among the amendments was a provision that limits what state and
local committees must disclose to the FEC, which reformers asserted
could make the new system even less transparent. "It appears to us
that the state party money channel will most likely become a flood
after the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act--more familiarly known as
either McCain-Feingold or Shays-Meehan--takes effect the day after
the midterm elections," Lewis said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   As for the FEC itself, Lewis added, "This is an agency that, based
on its record on enforcement, has a ghostlike presence," and he
characterized the reform act as "an attempt to put a Band-Aid on a
hemorrhage."</TE>
<TE>   The law's congressional sponsors--Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and
Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.) and Reps. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.)
and Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.)--have blasted the FEC for attempting
to rewrite the law, which took seven years to get through the House
and the Senate. They have scheduled a news conference today to
announce what they intend to do about it.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, most analysts say the future shape and reach of the
law, which has been challenged in the federal courts, is likely to be
determined by the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the tens of millions of dollars in soft money continue
to flow into the parties' coffers in this year's run-up to the Nov. 5
congressional elections.</TE>
<TE>   And again this year, Kirsch--a registered Republican until the
mid-1990s, he said--is right up there in the Top 10, confirming
Lewis' assertion that he gave an additional $1 million in soft money
to Democratic Party committees last March. In fact, Kirsch said, it
totaled $1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line, Kirsch said, is that he does not see himself as a
"special interest."</TE>
<TE>   He insists that he has gotten little or nothing back for the
millions he has put into the electoral system.</TE>
<TE>   "I got about a dozen thank-you letters from the state committees,"
he said. "Al Gore didn't even thank me, at first.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually, I got a personal call from the vice president, but I
had to ask for it."</TE>

<HD>Fire Crews Stall Ariz. Blaze Near Vacated Town</HD>
<DH>Disaster: President Bush acts to make federal relief funds
available to those affected. No edge of the 375,000-plus-acre blaze
is contained.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHOW LOW, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Firefighters Tuesday successfully staved off--at least for now--the
massive wildfire that was threatening this mountain community,
setting a series of back burns to stop flames approaching from the
west and south.</LD>
<LD>   Crews burned underbrush beneath towering ponderosa pines, robbing
oncoming flames of fuel. The optimistic turn occurred the same day
that President Bush flew over the blaze, which has charred more than
375,000 acres.</LD>
<LD>   The efforts on the west side of town were nothing short of a last
stand because the blaze--the largest in the state's history--had
crept to within a half-mile of the edge of town. Several small spot
fires ignited by blowing cinders were quickly extinguished in the
city, but no homes were damaged.</LD>
<TE>   And 10 miles south of town, hotshot crews burned a 13-mile
firebreak a half-mile wide that "basically thwarted" the oncoming
flames, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Paul Schmidtke said.</TE>
<TE>   Had that firebreak failed--and officials had given it a 50% chance
earlier in the day--flames could have followed several canyons
leading into the city of 7,700.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush viewed the charred region from the air Tuesday en
route to nearby Eagar, where he shook hands with grimy firefighters
before addressing several hundred evacuees in a high school
auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   "We're kind of used to big fires out West," Bush said, "but this
is the biggest of all big fires."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had declared the week-old fire a national disaster,
freeing federal funds for temporary and long-term housing, business
recovery and counseling needs.</TE>
<TE>   "I want you to know that a lot of people in our country are
pulling for you. They understand the suffering that families are
going through because of worry about your most precious possession,
your home," he said. "They understand that a lot of you are living in
tents when you'd rather be in your own bed. They cry for you, and
they hurt for you. And I'm here to say on behalf of the American
people, God bless you.</TE>
<TE>   "Hang in there, you brave and great people."</TE>
<TE>   About 30,000 people in Show Low and neighboring communities have
been evacuated, and the fire devastated some of the smaller towns,
including Heber and Overgaard. By Tuesday evening, the two-headed
fire had burned 586 square miles, an area larger than Los Angeles,
and destroyed at least 350 homes, including entire mobile home parks.
Fire officials said no edge of the fire had been contained.</TE>
<TE>   Given the size of the blaze, firefighting efforts have been
divided among four command centers. Along the fire's 180-mile
perimeter, about 10,000 homes remain threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Resources continued to pour into the region, and now include 300
hotshot crew members specially trained in setting backfires and more
than 100 fire engines.</TE>
<TE>   The only injury to date: a firefighter who sustained burns on an
arm and was treated and released from a local hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Across the U.S., 20 large fires are burning in nine states. More
than 2.5 million acres have burned this year, more than twice the
10-year average burned to date.</TE>
<TE>   Rain fell on the Hayman fire southwest of Denver, where crews had
encircled 70% of the 137,000-acre blaze, which just days ago was the
nation's most threatening fire.</TE>
<TE>   In southwestern Colorado, a new fire between Durango and Silverton
erupted Tuesday afternoon, forcing the evacuation of more than 90
homes. It burned just two miles west of the Missionary Ridge fire,
which had grown to 67,000 acres, officials said. That fire made a
threatening run after midnight Monday, and residents fled 45 homes
before it was stopped by backfires. It is now 30% contained.</TE>
<TE>   The fire here started as two separate blazes. The Rodeo fire was
discovered June 18 on the White Mountain Apache Reservation.
Investigators said it was apparently human-caused, but the exact
reason is unknown. Two days later, a lost hiker shot a flare,
igniting the Chediski fire several miles to the west of the Rodeo
blaze. The two fires merged Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Together, they have destroyed more homes than the notorious Los
Alamos fire in New Mexico in 2000, when a controlled burn blew out of
control, destroying more than 220 homes.</TE>
<TE>   This season's fires have stoked debate about the government's
changing philosophy over whether prescribed burns are necessary to
reduce the underbrush and smaller trees that serve as kindling,
igniting the crowns of larger trees that otherwise withstand ground
fires.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have areas of prescribed burns, you don't get the raging
wildfires you're getting here," said Jim Paxon, the U.S. Forest
Service chief spokesman here. "We're going to see a lot more of
these."</TE>
<TE>   The federal government changed its policy in 2000, embracing
controlled burns as a way to reduce forest underbrush. But because of
the extended drought, complaints from residents that the smoke is
irritating and the cost of planning and executing the fires, many
forest supervisors have been loath to order them.</TE>
<TE>   Bush made a glancing reference to the controversy Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, we've got a lot of work to do to make sure the Forest
Service has got wise forest policy," he said to applause."</TE>

<HD>Moussaoui Says Judge 'Undermining' Case</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: The accused '20th hijacker' rails at the court
system, saying it is simply 'preparing me for the gas chamber.' His
no contest plea is rejected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TiMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- As authorities pared down the case against
suspected "20th hijacker" Zacarias Moussaoui, a defiant Moussaoui on
Tuesday challenged the authority of the U.S. judicial system to put
him on trial for terrorism in a case he deemed "nonsense."</LD>
<LD>   "You are just preparing me for the gas chamber. That is what you
are doing," Moussaoui told a federal judge.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema gave Moussaoui some leeway to
lodge his angry grievances, but she grew impatient and said his
claims would be best taken up at his trial, which is due to start
Sept. 30. She rejected several motions from Moussaoui, including his
demand that the trial be moved to Colorado because he says the Sept.
11 attack on the nearby Pentagon has biased potential jurors in the
area against him.</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui's latest courtroom outburst came in his first appearance
as his own defense attorney, during his arraignment on a new capital
indictment returned against him last week by a grand jury in Northern
Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema read Moussaoui several dozen changes made in the
document's legal language since the initial indictment was returned
against him in December. The six charges, all involving conspiracy to
commit terrorism in concert with the Sept. 11 hijackers, remain
unchanged, and most of the other revisions involved slight changes in
wording, dates or dollar amounts.</TE>
<TE>   But the new indictment secured by the U.S. attorney's office also
deletes several references to crop-dusters, including Moussaoui's
alleged interest in starting a crop-dusting company while living in
Oklahoma and a computer disc with information on crop-dusting
applications found in his possession in Minneapolis after his arrest
last August.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities last year considered the material to be an important
part of their investigation, and the discovery of Moussaoui's
interest in crop-dusting prompted the FBI last fall to warn law
enforcement officials that terrorists might be planning to use the
agricultural planes to wage chemical attacks.</TE>
<TE>   With the deletion of the crop-dusting references, "it would appear
that [prosecutors] don't intend to bring that up as an overt act,"
said Alan H. Yamamoto, appointed by the court to act as a "stand-by"
counsel to assist in Moussaoui's defense.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors refused to discuss why the grand jury eliminated the
crop-dusting allegations from the indictment, but the move suggests
they intend to limit their case against Moussaoui to what happened on
Sept. 11 rather than on more speculative evidence about what else he
and other suspected terrorists may have been planning.</TE>
<TE>   Although Moussaoui was in jail in Minnesota on Sept. 11 on an
immigration charge, authorities allege that he was supposed to be the
20th hijacker. They maintain that his activities, including his
suspicious behavior at a flight training school and his receipt of a
$14,000 wire transfer from a suspected terrorist, mirrored those of
the 19 hijackers. He is the only person charged in the United States
in connection with the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui has not tried to hide his hatred for the United States
and for Jews around the world, saying he has prayed for their
destruction. But he continued to insist Tuesday that he "had nothing
to do with Sept. 11" and he says government officials, who he claims
have had him under surveillance for years, know that.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, facing the death penalty if convicted, refused to enter
a plea to the new indictment against him because he said he did not
recognize the authority of the court. "I have nothing to say to the
United States.... You are not here to represent me," he told the
judge, accusing her of using "every trick on the books" to thwart his
defense.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Moussaoui indicated he wanted to plead nolo
contendere, or no contest, but the judge told him that he did not
appear to understand that such a plea could be tantamount to a guilty
plea. Despite his objections, Brinkema entered a not guilty plea on
his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, who has refused to speak with Yamamoto since the court
picked the Virginia lawyer to assist in the defense, charged that
Brinkema was "interfering" with his defense by not allowing him to
pick his own legal advisor. He wants to use a Muslim attorney from
Houston, Charles Freeman, but Brinkema has balked at the move because
Freeman is not licensed to practice in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "You are undermining my position, my ability to defend myself,"
Moussaoui said. "This is unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Freeman, dressed in a traditional Muslim robe and skullcap, sat
quietly in the back of the courtroom and did not participate in the
proceeding. He told reporters he had "absolutely nothing to say," and
he refused to comment on Brinkema's charge that he violated federal
court rules by assisting Moussaoui with two recent motions even
though he was not officially his attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema also refused to give Moussaoui access to the addresses of
witnesses because she said they could be at risk. That move, too,
incensed Moussaoui because he said he would be unable to interview
witnesses in preparing his defense.</TE>
<TE>   "You are just putting me in my cell and running the show. I have
no meaningful way to defend myself. It is a parody," he told the
judge. "This is nonsense."</TE>

<HD>Puget Sound Orcas May Die Out, Over a Little Detail</HD>
<DH>Nature: A legal technicality bars federal protection as
their numbers dwindle in Northwest. Decision frustrates scientists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The declining number of orcas that sojourn in Washington's Puget
Sound could become extinct this century but cannot be protected by
the Endangered Species Act because of a legal technicality, federal
officials announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Federal biologists stated that the Puget Sound orcas, commonly
known as killer whales, don't qualify for protection under the act
because they are not a subspecies or a "distinct population segment"
separate from the larger, healthier population of whales in the
Pacific Coast.</LD>
<LD>   The National Marine Fisheries Service said it would invoke other
federal laws to try to safeguard the remnant population of 78 orcas
that suffer from a shrinking supply of salmon, a buildup of
industrial pollution and sometimes from the overly enthusiastic
attention of a fleet of whale watching boats.</LD>
<TE>   "This population needs our help and is in danger of going
extinct," said Bob Lohn, northwest regional administrator of the
national fisheries service. "But the law dictates that the Endangered
Species Act is not a tool we can use."</TE>
<TE>   The decision frustrated environmentalists who petitioned the
government to invoke the powerful law to help turn around the
"southern resident" population that has been in a nose dive since
1997.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Plater, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity,
called the rejection of the center's petition for endangered listing
"a new low" in the history of the National Marine Fisheries Service.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tragedy for the population," he said. "I find no other
reasonable explanation for it other than if you look at [President]
Bush's environmental record, you see how this is politically
motivated."</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, that's absolute nonsense," Lohn said. The decision
was reached by a panel of 11 government scientists after intense
debate by marine experts, he said. "They gave me their best advice
and I followed it. There was no political intervention."</TE>
<TE>   In making its decision, the science panel agreed that the Puget
Sound whales are in serious trouble and have more than a 10% chance
of becoming extinct within the next 100 years.</TE>
<TE>   But these orcas, the panel determined, do not meet the legal
criteria for protection as a distinct population group.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands now, biologists consider all orcas as one species.
Scientists, however, have noticed distinct differences and, as a
result, split them into different types.</TE>
<TE>   The three remaining pods of killer whales that spend from April to
September in the Puget Sound are called the "southern resident"
population.</TE>
<TE>   They eat almost exclusively salmon and other fish. Although
historically their range included California, they were last spotted
off the California coast 18 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   A "northern resident" population lives off Alaska and British
Columbia. Scientists also closely follow yet another population of
transient orcas that prowls the West Coast from Alaska to Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the fish-eating Puget Sound orcas, these transients
eat dolphins, seals, sea lions and great white sharks, and even work
together like a pack of wolves to take down and feed on a gray whale
or humpback whale, or more often, their young.</TE>
<TE>   "At a global level, it doesn't seem that the orca is at risk,"
said John Ford, an orca expert at Canada's Department of Fisheries
and Oceans. But he noted that orcas have grown scarce in some
areas--one of the reasons Canada recently decided to list the Puget
Sound whales as endangered under Canadian law.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists had hoped the U.S. Endangered Species Act would
have nudged federal officials to designate "critical habitat" where
the southern residents feed. Such a designation could tighten rules
governing toxic runoff, restricting salmon catches and keeping whale
watching boats at a more respectful distance.</TE>
<TE>   "Our populations are headed for the bottom, and we are not
providing the protections they deserve," said Elliott A. Norse,
president of the Marine Conservation Biology Institute in Redmond,
Wash. "It's an old story, a sad story."</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists believe the drop of the Puget Sound population is
related to a decline in salmon, a favorite food.</TE>
<TE>   Others suspect poisoning from industrial pollutants. Of
particularly concern are toxic PCBs, used as coolants and lubricants
in electrical equipment until they were banned in the late 1970s.
PCBs have been found in high concentrations in orca blubber.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists believe that such poisons may be linked to premature
deaths of adults and 50% mortality of calves.</TE>
<TE>   These toxins enter the food chain through microscopic organisms
that are eaten by small fish and continue in higher concentrations up
the food chain to orcas. Killer whales, with 3-inch teeth, consume
200 pounds or more of fish a day.</TE>
<TE>   Other scientists worry--though they have no hard evidence--that
orcas are becoming victims of their own celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   Whale watching boats crowd around these charismatic black and
white creatures as they breech, slap fins and gambol in the calm
waters in Puget Sound.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials are considering tightening whale watching rules.</TE>
<TE>   Orcas are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which
forbids killing or harassing them.</TE>
<TE>   "Our first job is to focus on interim protections and figure out
what's happening so we can turn it around," Lohn said. He said the
agency will revisit the endangered species issue in four years.</TE>
<TE>   Times researcher Lynn Marshall contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Rework Child Porn Bill</HD>
<DH>Media: The measure is approved after changes in provisions
rejected by the high court. The threat to mainstream films is eased.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly
approved legislation Tuesday to close a loophole left open by a
recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling involving the trafficking of child
pornography.</LD>
<LD>   In April, the court struck down parts of a federal child
pornography law that prohibited creating, distributing or owning
"virtual" images of young children engaged in sexual acts. The
decision stated that an offending image could not be outlawed if a
computer-generated image was "indistinguishable" from the real thing.</LD>
<LD>   The court feared that films such as "American Beauty" or
"Traffic," which depicted adult actors in juvenile sexual situations,
would be banned under the law, even though they should be protected
under the 1st Amendment. Congress fought back by examining the high
court's language and using it to craft the Child Obscenity and
Pornography Prevention Act. The bill, introduced in early May, uses
the legal principle of "affirmative defense" to make prosecutions
against traffickers and pedophiles easier, proponents say.</LD>
<TE>   Like other laws for statutory rape and slander, the principle of
"affirmative defense" is employed to place the burden of proof on the
defense. Child pornography that is "virtually indistinguishable" from
what is real would be illegal, proponents say, unless the defense can
prove that the offending images were created by computer or by using
adult actors.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, which passed 413 to 8, defines child pornography as
including "a computer image or computer-generated image that is, or
is indistinguishable from, that of a minor engaging in sexually
explicit conduct." Prohibited images would include those of minors
engaged in sexual or oral intercourse, bestiality, masturbation or
masochism.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years ago, the computer technology to disguise pictures of
real children being abused or exploited by distorting the image did
not exist. But now a few taps on a keyboard can make it difficult for
experts or juries to determine whether the child depicted is real or
fabricated.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the public threat from what lawmakers and child-welfare
advocates call "kiddie porn" is very real.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Lamar S. Smith (R-Texas), the bill's main sponsor, noted that
the government has already seen examples of Internet pornographers
taking advantage of the Supreme Court's decision. He quoted a Web
site that invited child pornographers to fire up their computers:
"With the law by our side, we are embarking on a marvelous
journey--by whetting the appetites of pedophiles everywhere," the
site says.</TE>
<TE>   "This is precisely what we don't want," Smith said, citing
statistics showing that 77% of molesters of young boys and 87% of
molesters of young girls admitted to habitually using pornography.</TE>
<TE>   The court's ruling did outline a method to prosecute offenders: If
an image is found obscene, the 1st Amendment would not protect it as
free speech. But prosecuting such cases is difficult, legal experts
say, and proving that an image or work is "patently offensive"
invites all manner of legal interpretation, hamstringing convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Many legislators were optimistic on Tuesday that the bill would
meet constitutional muster. But Rep. Robert C. Scott (D-Va.), one of
eight legislators who voted no, said the bill "turns the 1st
Amendment upside down."</TE>
<TE>   Lee Tien, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said
the resolution is constitutionally dubious. The category of child
pornography exists because children are harmed during the production
process, he argued, but the creative process is sacrosanct.</TE>
<TE>   Tien said existing laws against child pornography are sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Yet prosecutions have become increasingly difficult since the
April ruling, lawmakers said. The government has successfully
identified fewer than 100 children in computerized images, resulting
in lost prosecutions, said Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.).
The bill now goes to the Senate, and the Bush administration has said
it will support the legislation.</TE>

<HD>5-Term Lawmaker Loses Ala. Democratic Runoff</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- Five-term Rep. Earl Hilliard was ousted in a
Democratic runoff Tuesday after a nasty campaign against a younger,
well-funded challenger who swamped the impoverished Alabama district
with commercials questioning the incumbent's stance on the Middle
East.</LD>
<LD>   The astonishing victory by Harvard-educated lawyer Artur Davis was
tantamount to election because there is no Republican nominee.</LD>
<LD>   Hilliard, who in 1992 became the first black member of Alabama's
congressional delegation since Reconstruction, becomes the fifth
incumbent congressman to lose at the polls this year.</LD>
<TE>   With 87% of precincts reporting, Davis had 47,508 votes, or 57%,
and Hilliard had 35,515 votes, or 43%.</TE>
<TE>   Hilliard, 60, was forced into the first runoff of his career after
failing to win a majority in the primary earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a 34-year-old former federal prosecutor, aired a series of
stinging TV ads in which he criticized Hilliard's repeated ethics
scrapes and accused him of being linked to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Hilliard has said he supports creation of a Palestinian state and
recently opposed a resolution supporting Israel's self-proclaimed war
against terrorism. The stance won him support from Arab groups while
his opponent had the backing of Jews and pro-Israel groups. Both men
are black.</TE>
<TE>   Davis raised more money than Hilliard, much of it from Jews in New
York. Hilliard, who visited Libya in 1997, was backed by Arab donors
and members of the Congressional Black Caucus.</TE>
<TE>   In South Carolina, ex-Rep. Mark Sanford won the GOP gubernatorial
nomination to challenge Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges. With all
precincts reporting, Sanford had 181,984 votes, or 60%, and Lt. Gov.
Bob Peeler had 121,535, or 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Also in South Carolina, Gresham Barrett beat fellow state Rep. Jim
Klauber in the Republican race to succeed GOP Rep. Lindsey O. Graham,
who is running for the seat of retiring 99-year-old Sen. Strom
Thurmond.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * In Alabama, state GOP Rep. Sonny Callahan's chief of staff, Jo
Bonner, won the Republican nomination to succeed his boss, who is
retiring after nine terms. Alabama Democrats also chose State
Treasurer Susan Parker to challenge freshman GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions
this fall.</TE>
<TE>   * In Utah, voters were to decide two runoffs in the 1st
Congressional District, where Republican Rep. James V. Hansen is
retiring after 22 years. Businessman Kevin Garn--a distant relative
of former Sen. Jake Garn--and former Utah House Speaker Rob Bishop
sought the GOP nomination. The Democratic race pitted education
consultant Donald Dunn against advertising executive Dave Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   In Utah's 2nd District, state lawmaker John Swallow battled
venture capitalist Tim Bridgewater for the GOP nomination to face
Democratic Rep. Jim Matheson.</TE>

<HD>Panel Rejects Challenge to Romney's Bid</HD>
<DH>Politics: Massachusetts ballot commission says the
Republican is eligible to run for governor, backing the candidate's
residency claim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A state commission ruled Tuesday that Republican Mitt Romney is
eligible to run for governor, unanimously rejecting a challenge by
Democrats who contended the 55-year-old venture capitalist gave up
his Massachusetts residency while directing the Salt Lake City Winter
Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   The state Ballot Commission accepted Romney's argument that he was
not responsible for errors made by his accountant on tax returns,
declaring he fulfilled a requirement in the state constitution that
candidates for governor must reside in Massachusetts for at least
seven consecutive years.</LD>
<LD>   In a dispute that for weeks pushed aside issues such as education
and tax reform, Democrats contended that Romney gave up his status as
a Massachusetts resident when he listed Utah as his primary residence
for two years while organizing the 2002 Games.</LD>
<TE>   Romney countered that while residing in Utah, he continued to vote
in Massachusetts and maintain the home he owned for 30 years in
Belmont, outside Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Campaigning Tuesday on a farm in the western part of the state,
Romney welcomed the action by the commission, which is made up of
three Republicans, one Democrat and one member with no declared party
affiliation.</TE>
<TE>   "This challenge was designed not to be a credible challenge to my
candidacy, but to be an embarrassment," said Romney, wearing work
clothes and standing beside a cow.</TE>
<TE>   "I am more determined than ever to win."</TE>
<TE>   But James Roosevelt, legal counsel to the Democratic Party in
Massachusetts, said the inquiry conducted by the ballot commission
provided a valuable service to voters.</TE>
<TE>   "A number of important questions have been raised through this
challenge--legitimate questions about Mr. Romney's behavior as a
candidate and as a businessman," Roosevelt said, referring to
apparent inconsistencies in Romney's public statements.</TE>
<TE>   "Like many leading CEOs, Mr. Romney refuses to accept
responsibility for his financial behavior, for making false
statements and then blaming others for his misdeeds," Roosevelt
added.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy centered on a $54,000 tax break Romney received by
listing his Deer Valley, Utah, home as a primary residence. Romney at
first said the tax bill had gone to his wife, and later blamed a
clerical error in Utah for incorrectly categorizing his home.</TE>
<TE>   He also said his accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, had
mistakenly listed him as a part-year Massachusetts resident in 1999
and as a nonresident in 2000. Romney changed those forms in April
after deciding to enter the gubernatorial race.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats cited an interview Romney gave to a Utah newspaper to
suggest he was hedging his bets as he decided whether to run for
office from Utah or Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Romney and his attorneys argued that residence is not determined
by tax-filing status alone.</TE>
<TE>   Romney is the only Republican seeking election to an office
controlled by the GOP in Massachusetts for 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   Five Democrats are jockeying for the gubernatorial nomination in
their party.</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Durbin, a spokesman for State Treasurer Shannon
O'Brien--the leading Democratic candidate, polls show--said Tuesday
that the commission ruling was not unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the course of the next few months, the people of
Massachusetts will have to decide if Mitt Romney has been truthful
with them on this matter," Durbin said.</TE>
<TE>   A Boston Herald poll last week showed Romney receiving 45% of
votes against 35% for O'Brien.</TE>

<HD>Some Snowmobiling Is OK in Yellowstone, Park Service Says</HD>

<DL>CODY, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>CODY, Wyo. -- The National Park Service said Tuesday that it is
willing to allow snowmobiling to continue in Yellowstone and Grand
Teton national parks but with "very strict limitations," including
use of new technology to limit air pollution and noise.</LD>
<LD>   Park Service officials met with state and county representatives
from Idaho, Montana and Wyoming to discuss the controversial issue of
winter activities in the two parks.</LD>
<LD>   The overall policy is still being refined.</LD>
<TE>   The park service, during the final days of the Clinton
administration, proposed phasing out snowmobiles from the parks by
the winter of 2003-04. The snowmobile industry sued and the Bush
administration agreed to order a new study of snowmobiling in the
region.</TE>
<TE>   The framework outlined Tuesday would allow cleaner-burning and
quieter snow machines. It also favors guided snowmobile tours,
commercial and private, and proposes a management plan that can
change to accommodate new research or studies on such things as
effects on wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Many specifics were unclear, including how many snowmobiles would
be allowed and the sort of training some riders would need to lead
guided tours.</TE>
<TE>   A final decision is expected in November, with the policy to take
effect in the winter of 2003-04.</TE>

<DH>Blaze: Evacuees find refuge and kindness from many folks
they have never met.</DH>

<DL>SNOWFLAKE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>SNOWFLAKE, Ariz. -- Just when Sherry Jones, a fire refugee from Show
Low, was beginning to believe she could no longer hold herself
together for her young daughter, her car broke down at a stop sign
and she had no way to call for help.</LD>
<LD>   That's when Kurt Zoellner happened by, and she frantically
signaled him. Zoellner offered to take her to his home so she could
use his phone.</LD>
<LD>   "She was shaking and crying when I saw her at our front door,"
said Jennifer Zoellner, Kurt's wife.</LD>
<TE>   So the Zoellners did what hundreds of other families living on the
periphery of the Rodeo-Chediski forest fire have done: open their
homes to strangers who have been forced to evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Zoellner said she and Kurt had no idea what they were
getting into Sunday when he brought Jones and 7-year-old Anna Lee
into their home here, about 20 miles north of Show Low.</TE>
<TE>   But when disaster strikes, she said, "people become just people.
Whatever their financial problems are or whatever other problems they
have, they are all people in need."</TE>
<TE>   Things have worked out nicely. Jennifer and Sherry get along fine,
and Anna Lee and 7-year-old Annie, one of the Zoellners' four
children, have become good friends.</TE>
<TE>   "The girls hugged each other at bedtime the other night," Jennifer
Zoellner said.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Reidhead said families in his Snowflake Mormon church have
housed at least 300 evacuees, some of the 30,000 people forced to
flee the fire.</TE>
<TE>   One church member, Naomi Perkins, 53, met an elderly couple, Louis
and Joan Embertson, at a Red Cross lunch center here. She had heard
they had been spending nights in their Jeep, so she invited them into
her home.</TE>
<TE>   "They were very grateful," Perkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Louis Embertson said they spent one night in the Jeep when the
fire forced them to abandon a motel room in Show Low. They parked in
a Snowflake motel parking lot and "just tilted the seats back," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Embertson, who owns a home in Burton, near the fire's northern
edge, said Perkins and her husband, Roy, "are super nice people."</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Jones' situation wasn't quite as desperate. Some elderly
friends had kept her off the street for the first few days after the
evacuation.</TE>
<TE>   But they had also invited another couple in, and it had become
clear that Jones' welcome was wearing thin. With her daughter the
only child among four senior citizens, she sensed things were getting
tense.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of undercurrent there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones began to wonder what she and Anna Lee would do.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have been living in our car if Jenny and Kurt had not
opened up their home to us," she said. "It's not easy to take on
total strangers. They are so sweet, compassionate and giving in their
whole behavior."</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't know what she'll do if the fire takes her home. She
says she is haunted by the knowledge that she put her insurance
payment in the mail the day a cancellation notice arrived, fearing
her coverage might lapse.</TE>
<TE>   As a single mother, living on disability, it was a struggle to
make the house payments. She was able to buy the home after breaking
up with Anna Lee's father by selling their home in Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no money now if the fire takes her home.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very, very modest, but it was our home," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As Jones talked, she rose from the couch and walked to the kitchen
and picked up the Zoellners' phone, as she has done every day. She
tucked her head down as she dialed her own telephone number and
listened.</TE>
<TE>   "Please record your message at the tone," the answering machine
said, telling her the house still stands. She lifted her head, and
smiled.</TE>

<HD>Vitamins E and C Called Alzheimer's Inhibitors</HD>
<DH>Health: Studies in the U.S. and Netherlands are the first
to find a link between consumption of foods high in antioxidants and
prevention of the disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY SINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People who eat vitamin E-rich foods like nuts, vegetable oils and
leafy vegetables may reduce their risk of developing Alzheimer's
disease by as much as 70%, according to two new studies published to-
day .</LD>
<LD>   One of the studies also found that vitamin C-rich foods, such as
oranges and tomatoes, can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.</LD>
<LD>   The studies, published in the Journal of the American Medical
Assn., are the first to provide a link between consumption of foods
high in antioxidants like vitamins E and C and prevention of
Alzheimer's. Previous studies, which have focused on vitamin intake
through nutritional supplements, have produced conflicting results.</LD>
<TE>   Antioxidants have been shown to protect against the effects of
so-called "free radicals," oxygen molecules that can damage brain
cells. Researchers think that Alzheimer's patients have an excess of
these toxic free radicals.</TE>
<TE>   The first study, conducted at the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging
in Chicago, followed several hundred people over 65 years old for
nearly four years. Researchers found that those who consumed the most
vitamin E decreased their risk of developing Alzheimer's by 70%
compared to those who ate the least.</TE>
<TE>   People who ate lots of leafy green vegetables, such as kale and
collards, often showed the least risk of Alzheimer's, said lead
researcher Martha Morris.</TE>
<TE>   Morris and her colleagues did not see a similar benefit for people
taking vitamin E supplements. Morris downplayed the apparent
ineffectiveness of vitamin supplements, saying people may not have
been taking the supplements long enough. Varying forms of the vitamin
in supplements and foods also contribute to the difference, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Other antioxidants and supplements may have a protective effect,
"we just don't know yet," said Morris. Her group plans to extend the
duration of the study to check these possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   A second study, conducted by researchers at Rotterdam's Erasmus
Medical Center in the Netherlands, followed 5,000 people over six
years and also showed a similar benefit in eating vitamin E-rich
foods. People who most benefited consumed more than 15 milligrams of
vitamin E daily.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Thies, vice president of medical and scientific affairs at
the Alzheimer's Assn. in Chicago, said the studies still don't forge
a direct link between vitamin E and Alzheimer's. Rather they "point a
finger in that direction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the two studies conflicted in some respects.</TE>
<TE>   While the Rotterdam study found that foods rich in both vitamins C
and E, such as leafy greens, reduced the risk of developing
Alzheimer's, the Chicago study found that vitamin C had no benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago study also reported that people with a variation of
the gene, apolipoprotein E, which is found in many with a family
history of Alzheimer's, did not experience the protective effects of
a vitamin E-rich diet. The Rotterdam study found that those with the
gene seemed to experience the same protective effects of
antioxidants.</TE>
<TE>   Morris and Thies both emphasized that the only way to prove a
relationship between antioxidants and Alzheimer's would be to conduct
controlled clinical trials, in which half the participants take
vitamin E or eat foods high in vitamin E content, while the other
half take a placebo.</TE>

<DH>Tennis: Ancic, 18, upsets seventh-seeded Federer in three
sets to go from little-known qualifier to 'Super Mario.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>The voice sounded so familiar, with its accent and cadence. The owner
of the voice also possessed a powerful first serve, averaging 125 mph
in his first-round match.</LD>
<LD>   And so, if defending Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic couldn't
be here to play on Centre Court, then perhaps his spirit was lurking
around the All England Club. Cosmic forces, it seemed, had conspired
to bring the next-best thing, Ivanisevic's Croatian protege,
18-year-old Mario Ancic.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday morning, Ancic was a little-known qualifier from Split,
ranked 154th in the world. By nightfall, the youthful looking boy was
being called "Super Mario."</LD>
<TE>   Between morning and evening, Ancic sprang the biggest upset at
Wimbledon thus far, dispatching seventh-seeded Roger Federer of
Switzerland with poise and power, winning, 6-3, 7-6 (2), 6-3. For
Federer, this was his second straight first-round loss in a Grand
Slam. He has turned a good year into a shaky one in less than a
month.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm terribly down right now," said Federer, who made his name by
beating Pete Sampras here last year in the fourth round. "I expected
much more than coming in here and losing in straight sets. For the
moment, I haven't got any words."</TE>
<TE>   Ancic didn't need words to describe his joy when Federer hit a
forehand passing shot wide on Ancic's first match point. He pumped
his fists, leaned back and unleashed a scream, then threw a tennis
ball into the second level of seats on Centre Court.</TE>
<TE>   He became the first teenager to make his Wimbledon debut a win on
Centre Court since Bjorn Borg did it in 1973 at 17. This was only his
second tour-level match of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel great," Ancic said. "I just played one of the best matches
in my life, so how can I feel? I cannot feel better, I think."</TE>
<TE>   Said Federer, "I couldn't quite figure out his serve. I was
struggling to read his toss. I still think conditions are much slower
than last year. I maybe made one ace, I think. It's a joke, I think I
made 25 against Pete last year.... I don't know what was wrong
today."</TE>
<TE>   The chief beneficiaries of Federer's exit would appear to be No. 1
Lleyton Hewitt of Australia and No. 4 Tim Henman of Britain, who are
in his half of the draw. Hewitt faced a potentially difficult opening
test against Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden, who'd won last week's
pre-Wimbledon tournament at Nottingham, but won in convincing
fashion, 6-4, 7-5, 6-1. Henman never faced deuce on his own serve,
defeating French qualifier Jean-Francois Bachelot, 6-1, 6-3, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   There was one other significant upset. Brazilian Flavio Saretta
took out Australian Open champion, No. 8 Thomas Johansson of Sweden,
6-7 (2), 6-4, 7-6 (4), 3-6, 12-10, in 4 hours 21 minutes. It was
Saretta's first tour-level grass-court victory.</TE>
<TE>   Saretta and Ancic had performed well at Wimbledon as juniors.
Saretta made the quarterfinals in 1998, and Ancic lost in the final
in 2000 at 16.</TE>
<TE>   By then, he was working with respected coach Bob Brett. Brett also
coached Boris Becker and Ivanisevic, from 1991-95. Initially, Brett
had to tame Ancic's Ivanisevic-type spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he calmed me a lot in four years," Ancic said. "In the
beginning, I had to do push-ups for every [bad] word I [said] because
he knew everything from Goran. I was unlucky there."</TE>
<TE>   Brett advised him to view Centre Court before the match, which he
did. Also, Ivanisevic had called the night before with some advice on
how to play Federer. How about staying away from that forehand?</TE>
<TE>   Ancic also had practiced with Jim Courier on grass.</TE>
<TE>   "We hit for one hour," Ancic said. "He's still hitting good, I can
tell you that."</TE>
<TE>   That was set up by Brett, who has the larger picture in mind for
his pupil.</TE>
<TE>   "He also played with [Pat] Cash at Queen's," Brett said. "I think
that it's important for young players to be able to establish some
sort of relationship with older players. He played with [John]
McEnroe a couple of years ago, at Paris, in the French. So that was
good.... That's how history is passed on. That's how they have some
sort of connection, building something for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Though people are bound to make comparisons between Ancic and
Ivanisevic--each is 6 feet 4, lanky, and possesses an understated
sense of humor--the youngster was eager to establish that he is not a
clone.</TE>
<TE>   "Goran is Goran," he said. "Not me.... It was all the time since I
grew up they were talking that I am second Goran. But Goran says the
best sentence that describes everything: 'Next Goran will be [my]
son.' I'm Mario."</TE>
<TE>   Brett echoed these sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   "Goran's a completely different athlete," he said. "Also, the
speed of his arm, I thought, was completely different. The way Mario
is prepared to attack much more than Goran did. Mario is more
straightforward, straight ahead, 'Boom, I'm going to attack. This is
where I'm going.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ancic's composure was admirable in his first Centre Court
performance. At 18, Ivanisevic probably would have broken out his
three personalities to deal with the big-time occasion.</TE>
<TE>   There is no good Mario, bad Mario or emergency Mario.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still one," Ancic said, laughing. "He's unique."</TE>

<HD>With Help From the Famous, Foreign Aid Resurges</HD>
<DH>Invest the new funding wisely or risk another backlash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAEL BRAINARD</AU>
<BD>Lael Brainard, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution, was deputy national economic advisor in the Clinton
administration.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The end of the Cold War, deep disillusionment with the many failures
of U.S. foreign aid and the drive to balance the budget produced a
slash-and-burn approach to foreign aid during the 1990s. By the end
of the decade, foreign economic assistance had fallen to just over
one-half of 1% of budget outlays, compared with more than 3% in 1962.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, things are beginning to swing the other way. Why?</LD>
<LD>   First, aid advocates have developed a powerful four-part recipe
for mobilizing public support: a simple, compelling goal; surprising
spokespersons, such as U2's Bono, Microsoft's Bill Gates and the
pope; transnational coalitions such as Drop the Debt and the Global
AIDS Alliance that unite opposite ends of the political spectrum; and
a focus on high-profile international gatherings, such as annual
meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</LD>
<TE>   The first big victory came in 1998, when the unbeatable team of
Bono and the pope, working with activists, persuaded leaders of the
richest nations to adopt an unprecedented initiative to forgive the
debt of the poorest nations. A similarly eclectic coalition,
including Gates and some of the economics profession's best and
brightest, helped rivet world attention on the global HIV/AIDS
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, in 2000, even as budget authority for development aid
fell overall, President Clinton won authorization for nearly $1
billion for debt forgiveness for the poorest nations and for global
efforts to fight HIV/AIDS. Second, since Sept. 11, the campaign
against terrorism has provided a rationale for foreign assistance
missing since the end of the Cold War. Having enlisted critical
foreign partners in the fight against international terrorism, the
Bush administration could hardly ignore the need to do more in the
fight against international poverty. This was evident in President
Bush's proposal for a $10-billion increase in U.S. development
spending. And leading Democrats have sounded a similar call. House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt has called the case for foreign
aid a "strategic rationale."</TE>
<TE>   But achieving genuine gains on international poverty will be
harder than mustering bipartisan support for upping the budget. For
one thing, our security and development goals are not the same.</TE>
<TE>   It is tempting to use development assistance to reward those who
are "with us" in the fight against terrorism. But during the Cold
War, that same logic led to many horror stories of corrupt leaders
using aid to line their own pockets or fund pet projects, which
discredited foreign assistance and contributed to a decade of aid
fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   And in too many cases, U.S. aid curried favor with foreign leaders
without advancing democracy, improving health and education or
helping poor economies sustain growth.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, focusing on a single issue in isolation is not good
development policy. For example, it does not make sense to help pay
for increases in global HIV/AIDS funding by reducing U.S. spending on
international malaria and tuberculosis, as is proposed in Bush's 2003
budget.</TE>
<TE>   There is no silver bullet in the fight against global poverty.
That is why the international community has begun asking poor nations
to present their spending priorities within a coherent overall
framework.</TE>
<TE>   It would be easy to dismiss the recent tour of Africa by Bono and
U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. But Bono and Paul's
excellent adventure is emblematic of a broader political shift that
could put development aid back in play.</TE>
<TE>   At the G-8 economic summit in Canada, which opens today, leaders
of the richest nations will devote a day to the new partnership for
African development. President Bush has announced increases in
spending on HIV/AIDS and primary education that, while modest, are a
step in the right direction. The coming together of opposite ends of
the political spectrum and heightened public awareness present a
tantalizing opportunity to make progress in fighting debilitating
poverty. But it is critical to invest the money soberly--or risk
another backlash.</TE>

<HD>Politically Speaking, It's Greasy Kid Stuff</HD>
<DH>'No child left behind' slogan is meaningless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRISPIN SARTWELL</AU>
<BD>Crispin Sartwell teaches philosophy at the Maryland
Institute College of Art.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"No child left behind": The first time I heard that phrase, I think,
it was emerging from the mush-mouth of Elizabeth Dole. Before long,
George W. Bush was using it in every speech. Al Gore picked up on it
too, and soon all of our political cherubim were choiring in unison,
strumming their golden harps and flitting hither and thither with a
glaze of empty benevolence in their eyes.</LD>
<LD>   And now, "No Child Left Behind" has literally become the
Department of Education anthem.</LD>
<LD>   Written by two producers for the department's propaganda wing, the
Public Broadcasting Service, the song is being employed by Secretary
of Education Rod Paige as he barnstorms blankly through the nation
promoting the administration's education plan. Here is a sample:</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We're here to thank our great</TE>
<TE>   president</TE>
<TE>   For signing this great bill,</TE>
<TE>   That's right! Yeah,</TE>
<TE>   Research shows we know the</TE>
<TE>   way,</TE>
<TE>   It's time we showed the will!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Education Department is considering having the song performed
by children as Paige makes his way across the country and playing it
when telephone callers to the department are on hold.</TE>
<TE>   "No child left behind" is the very acme of American political
rhetoric, a perfect encapsulation of who we are as a culture.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, it is trivial: The reason people keep saying it
incessantly is because no one could possibly disagree with the
sentiment it expresses.</TE>
<TE>   Second, it is false. No matter whose education plan is passed,
many children will be left behind, and perhaps I may be excused for
noticing that a lot of them will be black and poor.</TE>
<TE>   No party has the will or the way to educate every child
effectively; that's reality. For one thing, people are, thank God, in
part responsible for their own education and the education of their
children.</TE>
<TE>   Third, in the mouths of the people who mutter it, "no child left
behind" is meaningless. It is something that emerges when the brain
ceases to function entirely, when the politician is thinking about
something important (like a good alibi) and intends to let his mouth
keep going without him.</TE>
<TE>   Thus "no child left behind," in its epiphanic synthesis of
banality, mendacity and vacuity, crystallizes in a single phrase who
we are as a people: our deepest beliefs and our deepest public
commitments.</TE>
<TE>   The folks who wrote the tune are Christopher Cerf and Sarah Bruce
Durkee, creators of the PBS series "Between the Lions." In hiring
them, the White House missed a signal opportunity to get R&amp;B singer
R. Kelly on board as songwriter in chief. Facing 21 counts of child
pornography, Kelly apparently specializes in children and in
triteness and has recently issued his self-exculpatory anthem,
"Heaven I Need a Hug." Kelly, whose ethics baste in the sewer while
his rhetoric takes to the skies, is obviously presidential timber.
His lyric "I believe I can fly" is trivial, false and empty: American
politics in a nutshell.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the missed opportunity, the PBS connection is perfectly
appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Try to sit down and watch PBS kids' shows such as "Caillou" or
"Dragon Tales": moral gruel served up by blank-eyed tokens. These
shows go so far out of their way to avoid controversy that they
entirely avoid content.</TE>
<TE>   The poor, unsuspecting children who are submerged in this slop
will grow up thinking that emptiness is truth, that vacuity is
profundity and that Al Gore or Rod Paige has just said something.</TE>
<TE>   They will grow up into a public life that is utterly piddling and
totally disingenuous.</TE>
<TE>   They will grow up, in short, to be Americans.</TE>

<HD>False Confidence Sets Back the Anti-AIDS Effort</HD>
<DH>Medical progress may be fueling a return to high-risk
behavior.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SATCHER</AU>
<BD>David Satcher, the U.S. surgeon general from 1998 to
2002, is a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After several years of steady decline in new AIDS cases and deaths
and a recent stabilization of new HIV infections, our nation is
beginning to see troubling regressions in some populations,
particularly among gay and bisexual men and African Americans and
Latinos.</LD>
<LD>   For those of us in the health and public policy communities, this
shift in the epidemic is a clarion call that we must redouble our
efforts--and resources--to urge all Americans at high risk for
HIV/AIDS to take steps to stop the spread of the epidemic.</LD>
<LD>   While significant progress has been made in educating the public
about HIV/AIDS and in providing better and more effective medical
care for those living with the disease, the fight is far from over.</LD>
<TE>   Of paramount importance in this struggle is convincing those who
feel they may be at risk for HIV/AIDS to be tested if they have not
been.</TE>
<TE>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that
almost 300,000 HIV-positive people in the United States do not know
they are infected with the virus. Not only are these individuals not
receiving vital medical treatment that could prolong and enhance
their lives, they may be putting others at risk.</TE>
<TE>   As we fight to get more people tested for HIV, a call to action
from another challenging time in our history rings true today: "The
only thing we have to fear is fear itself." Fear of the stigma of
being HIV-positive, of the consequences of identifying oneself as
homosexual, of the inability to afford or have access to care and
treatment--these are just a few of the most commonly cited barriers
to getting tested.</TE>
<TE>   For some, HIV and AIDS can still be difficult to talk about. But
talk about it we must.</TE>
<TE>   Only by addressing these challenges and replacing these fears with
hope can we help stem the resurgent tide of unsafe behaviors in some
populations, particularly among young gay and bisexual men.</TE>
<TE>   Events such as Thursday's National HIV Testing Day are an
important first step.</TE>
<TE>   Reaffirming our commitment to prevention is also critical in
regaining our momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Although anecdotal evidence suggests that most Americans are aware
of the AIDS "basics," such as how HIV is transmitted, we cannot relax
or relent in our outreach and prevention efforts.</TE>
<TE>   We must continue to educate Americans, particularly our youth,
about risky behaviors that can lead to HIV infection and target
people who are at risk for HIV infection and do not know it.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past two decades, the HIV epidemic in the U.S. has
expanded from one that at first primarily affected whites to one in
which the majority of those affected are members of communities of
color.</TE>
<TE>   Today, according to CDC estimates, African Americans and Latinos,
who make up slightly more than 25% of the U.S. population, are
disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Yearly, 54% of
estimated new HIV infections occur among African Americans and 19%
among Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   We must come together as a nation and work hand in hand to address
HIV's disproportionate impact on minorities.</TE>
<TE>   We also cannot tolerate any form of complacency in our efforts to
inform our young people about HIV/AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   After years of hearing about declines in AIDS cases and deaths,
adolescents and young adults have become overly comfortable and are
once again engaging in behaviors that put them at risk. The CDC
estimates that half of all new HIV infections occur in people under
age 25.</TE>
<TE>   National HIV Testing Day serves as an important reminder: "Take
the test. Take control." Only through a global commitment to
individual responsibility can we hope to achieve the ultimate
victory: slowing and eventually stopping the spread of this
devastating disease.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In his dozen years as a deputy with the Sacramento County Sheriff's
Department, Sgt. Matthew Reale has encountered people dwelling on the
street who are wildly delusional, utterly wretched and clearly unable
to make decisions that could lead to a healthier life. And, like
these people's frustrated families, Reale has been powerless to help
because of California's rigidly restrictive 5150 standard--named for
a section of the Welfare and Institutions Code that says people can
be compelled to get treatment only when they are in imminent danger
of harming themselves or others.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, at a hearing for AB 1421, the 32-year-old deputy joined
families of people with severe mental illness who had hurt themselves
or others.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, by Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis), would lower
the standard of involuntary treatment to what insiders dub "5149 and
a half."</LD>
<TE>   Thomson's legislation is called "Laura's law," after a 19-year-old
high school valedictorian killed in Northern California by a man
whose mental illness went untreated. Under it, a judge, after
consulting with a severely mentally ill person, his legal
representative, family members and mental health professionals, could
order outpatient treatment if that person would otherwise be at risk
of "substantial deterioration." Law officers like Reale could send
the sick person to a hospital or clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Reale says the ever-so-slight lowering of the standard would "help
20 severely mentally ill people I know who are living on the streets
right now."</TE>
<TE>   AB 1421 passed the Senate Health Committee last Wednesday in a 7-0
vote, but only after civil libertarians persuaded the committee's
chairwoman, Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento), to tack on a bevy of
amendments. The Senate Judiciary Committee will probably consider the
bill next week.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the amendments are sensible attempts to strengthen the
legislation's already strong protections of the rights of people with
mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   The amendments would, for example, require public defenders to be
present at any commitment hearing and require county mental health
directors to review each petition to ensure that severely mentally
ill people aren't sent to court frivolously.</TE>
<TE>   We urge Assemblywoman Thomson to compromise and accept six of the
seven proposed add-ons.</TE>
<TE>   She, Ortiz and the Judiciary Committee, however, should reject the
remaining amendment: rigid ideologues' brazen attempt to nullify the
bill by restricting eligibility for the new program to people who
meet California's current 5150 standard.</TE>
<TE>   Like others who are fed up with the deplorable status quo that
allows mentally ill people to live and die on America's streets,
Reale says the peculiar amendment befuddles him. "We already have a
system for 5150--hospitalization and jail," he says. "We need
something for people before they get to that [condition] so they can
receive treatment in the community."</TE>

<HD>Sheriff Baca's Power Play</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When last we heard from Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, he'd
threatened to release 400 inmates awaiting trial for minor,
nonviolent crimes such as burglary and vandalism who were being held
on bail of $25,000 or less. Baca said the looming county budget cuts
were forcing him to take tough cost-cutting measures. Then, after a
wave of protest, he promised to delay following through on his threat
until July 1, after the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted
on the Sheriff's Department budget.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly last week, more than 1,200 inmates who were serving time
for misdemeanor crimes walked out of the jails, at Baca's invitation.
It's hard to miss the power play.</LD>
<LD>   Those released were inmates convicted of misdemeanors such as
petty theft, forgery and shoplifting who had no history of violence
and no outstanding warrants. They may not have been classified as
dangerous, but their crimes were not victimless. Their early freedom
won't sit well with anyone who has been blindsided by a forged check
or a huge bill run up on a stolen credit card. Baca, as Supervisor
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke pointed out, can't guarantee that the newly
released criminals won't break the law again.</LD>
<TE>   Baca blames the early release on a 10% increase in the jail
population since December. Releasing inmates a few days early to
relieve overcrowding can be a reasonable step, but it wouldn't be
reasonable now, given the sheriff's threats and actions.</TE>
<TE>   Baca isn't the first L.A. County sheriff to go the early-release
route. He learned well from his predecessor, Sherman Block, who
during his own budget battles also misused his power over the jails
to let thousands of inmates out early. That tactic was wrong then.
It's wrong now.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors can't fire the elected sheriff or tell
him how to spend his money, but it does determine the size of his
budget. The supervisors are scheduled to vote today. Considering the
no-win choices the county faces in contemplating deep health-care
cuts, the Sheriff's Department cannot expect to escape without its
share of belt-tightening.</TE>
<TE>   Baca should save the supervisorial arm-twisting for issues and
causes the public can readily support. Setting criminals free on the
eve of a budget vote isn't the issue or the cause.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's summer in Sacramento. The temperature is nudging 100 degrees.
And the state faces a budget crisis with a new fiscal year just five
days away. So what else is new?</LD>
<LD>   One new twist is the magnitude of the problem, a deficit of $24
billion, caused primarily by a free fall of income taxes on capital
gains and stock options in the technology industry. Another is that
this is a gubernatorial election year.</LD>
<LD>   Politics were definitely afoot in the Senate on Tuesday when
Republicans blocked passage of a $4.7-billion revenue program,
including a temporary increase in the income tax on the wealthiest
Californians and a 50-cent-a-pack boost in cigarette taxes. Sponsored
by the Democratic leadership, it is a reasonable program, resembling
the hikes then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, proposed in a similar
crisis in 1991.</LD>
<TE>   Even with the state facing a huge deficit, Republicans say they
won't raise taxes. Yet they voted for more money for schools and
other programs, which everyone wanted. In addition, they voted for a
massive cut in the auto license tax. Cut programs, they say. But
billions of dollars already have been cut.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP is not the only problem for the tax plan. In the political
campaign, Davis needs to keep his Republican challenger, Bill Simon
Jr., from successfully labeling him as a tax booster. Such an effort
by Simon might be blunted by a Davis proposal to roll back half of
the vehicle license tax cuts, for a savings of $3.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Far better for the state than that Davis proposal, however, is the
Democrats' plan to boost the 9.3% income tax to 10% for couples with
taxable incomes of $260,000 to $500,000 and to 11% for those over
$500,000. These people got a big federal tax cut last year. The 10%
and 11% brackets were first established by Gov. Ronald Reagan but
later repealed. A couple with $400,000 taxable income, in the 10%
bracket, would have a $601 tax increase after taking the federal
deduction.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Democrats' tax plan, Californians still would experience
cuts in important state services. But the proposal would provide
funds to restore some vital items to the budget, including better
Medi-Cal reimbursement, the expansion of the Healthy Families
program, aid to local government and additional money to fight forest
and brush fires.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans seem willing to gamble that a budget stalemate will
damage Davis and improve Simon's chances. However, history teaches
that the budget holdouts suffer just as much politically. And all
Californians would see once again that some of their legislators are
incapable of fulfilling basic duties.</TE>
<TE>   But Sacramento has five more days. It's still possible to get a
budget on time.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Palestinian State Requires New Leadership, Bush Says," June 25:
From someone who wanted nothing to do with the Middle East, which is
why it has spiraled out of control, President Bush surely has become
bold now. His idea that getting rid of Yasser Arafat would solve the
whole problem is absurd. Arafat, although disgusting, was at least
democratically elected, and the U.S. has no right to decide who will
lead other countries. This very kind of bold talk plays a big part in
terrorism within the United States, as we are seen as dictators and
they resent our interference and our long-term support of Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Regarding Arafat, who is to say that a new leader would not be
even worse? Maybe some other country can order us to choose a new
leader. Now, that would clearly be an improvement.</LD>

<TE>   Monday's address from President Bush, as well as your front-page
coverage of that event, put great emphasis on Arafat's role in
Palestinian violence. No doubt Arafat and his henchmen are terrorists
who must be removed in order for there ever to be peace in the Middle
East. Yet by focusing almost exclusively on Arafat and the
Palestinian political leadership, we may be missing the point.</TE>
<TE>   As long as the Palestinian Authority's religious leaders preach
vengeance, its educational leaders teach hate and its media leaders
incite, any Palestinian state will be a terrorist one--with or
without Arafat. If we don't learn that lesson soon, it will be
another busload of Israeli high school students in Jerusalem
suffering the consequences.</TE>

<TE>   I'd like to congratulate Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney on
the president's principled and visionary statement on the Middle
East. It is refreshing to know that there are still real statesmen
among the politicians. I rate this speech right up there with
President Reagan's "tear down this wall" speech in Berlin, which led
to the liberation of Eastern Europe and the disintegration of the
Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   I believe that Monday will be remembered in history as the day
marking the beginning of the end of the theological and dictatorial
regimes in the Middle East and the dawn of a new age of democracy in
the region.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Israel must now boldly step up to the plate and take the
initiative. It must arrest Arafat, supervise democratic elections in
which terrorists cannot be candidates and monitor the schools to
prevent the teaching of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   This would expedite the process wherein the Palestinian people
would not have to risk life and limb to rise up against the armed and
corrupt government. America did the same in Germany and Japan. It
would surely bring an outcry from other countries, but these
governments are not Israel's supporters in any event.</TE>

<LD>Was it pure coincidence or timely homage that the day after The
Times' June 21 obituary of award-winning sports photographer Morris
Berman and his fantastic 1964 photo of defeated quarterback Y.A.
Tittle, you ran an almost identical photo of another defeated
athlete, U.S. soccer team forward Landon Donovan, on your front page
(June 22)?</LD>
<LD>   As interesting as I found the story of Berman's life, I was even
more touched by the visual proof that his brilliance in choosing to
focus on the emotion, not just the action, of sports continues to
influence the field of photography more than 35 years later.</LD>

<LD>Re "17 Blazes Charring the West," June 23: Many thousands of acres of
forests and many homes are burned in forest fires almost every year
in the U.S., and it is a tragedy to all. But when the Forest Service
and firefighters agree that some of these fires can be averted
through careful forest thinning, can't we make a compromise between
environmentalists and the lumber industry and have some trees cut
away annually?</LD>

more work to take care of the environment but it will burn out its

hose for fire-extinguishing purposes. Indeed, we are an adaptable

<LD>Re "No Idle Boast: L.A. Traffic Worst--Again," June 21: It comes as
no surprise that, once again, L.A. tops the list of America's most
traffic-congested cities. California's response to the study is to
threaten to withdraw our funding because our state's bureaucrats
don't think the conclusions were fair. Jeff Morales, director of the
California Department of Transportation, groused that many traffic
improvements, like traffic cameras and tow truck services, were not
taken into account when calculating traffic delays.</LD>
<LD>   However, the only statistics that really count are the experiences
of everyday commuters. The Times has reported on neighborhoods that
want to close their streets to rush-hour traffic and about opponents
to housing development who fear future traffic problems.</LD>
<LD>   The only recent fixes we have seen to L.A.'s traffic problem are a
few patches on the 405 and 101 freeways. We need real traffic relief
that includes new freeways and high-speed surface streets. We need a
Legislature that will spend our gas-tax dollars where they are
supposed to go--for new roads, not pipe dreams.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have found that by scheduling my time better, I can beat the
traffic problem. I work in the mid-Wilshire district and live in
Sherman Oaks. I walk a half-mile to the bus stop and take the bus to
the Red Line station in North Hollywood. I ride the train to Wilshire
Boulevard-Vermont Avenue and walk another half-mile to my office. As
the buses are only every half-hour, I have to schedule myself or
suffer a long wait for the bus. The walk is also good for me.
Incidentally, a senior pass is only $12 a month--what a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Your article in Southern California Living on men's purses ties
into this. As I don't want my billfold to be accessible while I am
riding public transportation, I bought a messenger bag. It holds my
billfold, MTA pass and house keys. One of the inside pockets holds a
book and reading glasses, one my lunch and the third my cell phone
and, if needed, a travel umbrella. How self-contained can one be? I
see more and more men carrying similar bags, although I must admit I
also see a lot of plastic shopping bags wrapped around lunches.</TE>

<TE>   Since my recent move to downtown Los Angeles (where I work), I
have spent virtually no time stuck in traffic and my fuel expenses
have been less than $50 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Most days I utilize public transportation and still add an hour to
my life every morning and evening.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic is only one of the ills of L.A.'s two-plus decades of
sprawl. Expanding our freeways would constitute a tiny bandage on a
massive, festering wound. As transportation expert James Corless
proposed in the article, the real long-term solution is to establish
affordable family-living solutions closer to the work centers of the
city. More people living closer to work means more people walking or
taking the subway or bus and fewer people sitting on freeways.</TE>
<TE>   While budget cuts are looming in key social services in our
region, it would be irresponsible for the state to dump billions into
a massive freeway expansion plan. It is time that Southern
Californians take responsibility for where they have chosen to live
and realize that the best way to spend less time in traffic is to
live closer to work.</TE>

<LD>Re "Unions Ready to Fight L.A. Breakup Plans," June 22: As a
middle-class union man, I can only thank both Studio City attorney
David Fleming and Richard Close, president of the secession group
Valley VOTE, for their glib statements regarding unions, thereby
providing another nail in the coffin of the secession movement.</LD>
<LD>   Close: "Let's face it. The municipal unions are part of the
problem. They control the City Council. Luckily there are a lot more
people in the Valley who are concerned about quality of life in the
Valley rather than city employees' pension plans." No. Luckily there
are unions that will help me get a decent wage and the prospect of a
pleasant retirement. No double dipping for me!</LD>
<LD>   Fleming: "Unions don't recognize the fact that the overall job is
to deliver services at low costs." You want low costs? Perhaps the
new city would just drive along Oxnard Street and pick up the day
laborers seeking $5 an hour. Low cost, no payroll taxes to pay, no
pension. They do work hard. Yeah, that's the ticket. Are you
listening, all you union members out there?</LD>

<HD>DWP Denies Energy Scheme</HD>
<DH>Probe: Utility head says it did not try to avoid price caps
and didn't lie to investigators. E-mail alleging 'ricochets' appears
to conflict with testimony, senator says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Responding to allegations by a state senator, Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power officials said Tuesday that
they had not engaged in Enron-style electricity-trading strategies
and had not lied about it to state and federal investigators.</LD>
<LD>   "We testified truthfully," said the DWP's acting general manager,
David Wiggs. "LADWP played by the rules and did not try to avoid
price caps during the energy crisis or any other time."</LD>
<LD>   The city-owned utility was reacting to allegations in a November
2000 e-mail from an electricity trader that warned fellow traders to
"beware of ricochets with LDWP."</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), chairman of a Senate committee that
is investigating price manipulation of California's now-defunct power
market, said Friday that the e-mail appeared to conflict with sworn
testimony by DWP officials.</TE>
<TE>   In their testimony, officials of the department told Dunn's
committee and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the DWP
had not engaged in the sort of power-trading schemes detailed by
Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Market Manipulations</TE>
<TE>   Traders for the bankrupt Houston energy company, in a December
2000 memo made public last month, described "ricochet" as a strategy
to raise power prices by exporting electricity out of state and
bringing it back in to California grid operators willing to pay high
prices to avoid blackouts. Such a scheme could also circumvent price
caps in California.</TE>
<TE>   DWP officials say the term "ricochet" in the Nov. 12, 2000, e-mail
obtained by Dunn's committee refers to a different sort of
arrangement, one in which power moved on DWP's transmission lines
never leaves the state. The e-mail was written by a trader with the
unregulated power-trading division of PG&amp;E Corp. to his colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   It referred to a Nov. 11, 2000, transaction in which DWP helped to
move power for PG&amp;E National Energy Group from Arizona to Northern
California for $1,250, Wiggs said.</TE>
<TE>   "This deal was about helping a fellow utility bring much-needed
energy into the marketplace and nothing more," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs added, "We are obviously concerned when a key state official
suggests representatives of the LADWP would perjure themselves under
oath."</TE>
<TE>   Hiding Ricochets</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail by the PG&amp;E Corp. trader warned that California grid
operators were "savvy to LA's attempts to circumvent ricochets by
showing an export and import of equal megawatts" on the California
border "in order to hide the ricochet nature of the transaction."</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E Corp.'s National Energy Group turned over a copy of the
e-mail after Dunn's committee asked for evidence that any other buyer
or seller in California's power market might have tried to manipulate
prices with methods allegedly practiced by Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The PG&amp;E Corp. subsidiary itself denied having engaged in such
schemes.</TE>
<TE>   Committee Vice Chairman Sen. Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) has asked
that officials of DWP and other municipal utilities appear at a
hearing Thursday in Sacramento to "explain their relationships with
Enron and allegations of market-gaming."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter sent Tuesday to Wiggs, Dunn said DWP's attempts to
describe the term ricochet as an accounting-type transaction "raise
many concerns."</TE>
<TE>   "It is peculiar that a group of traders at NEG would find it
necessary to urge caution ... for an 'accounting-type' transaction,"
Dunn wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Until DWP offers another definition, he added, "we stand by our
concern that ricochet means ricochet."</TE>

<HD>Armored-Car Courier Shot by Robber in Long Beach</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An armored-car courier was shot in the head at a North Long Beach
warehouse grocery store Tuesday by a robber who fled in a sport
utility vehicle, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Gunfire erupted at 11 a.m. in the 2300 block of East 68th Street
when a man surprised Victor Hurtado, 33, of Paramount, as he walked
out of the Jetro Cash and Carry store with a satchel containing an
undisclosed amount of cash, said Long Beach Police Officer Jana
Blair.</LD>
<LD>   Hurtado, who was listed in critical condition at Lakewood Regional
Medical Center, was shot just a few feet from his Sectran Armored Car
Service vehicle, Blair said.</LD>
<TE>   Neither the victim nor the armored-car driver, who was uninjured,
returned fire during the holdup, Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, a red two-door Chevrolet Blazer was found engulfed
in flames about a mile away, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Police searched the neighborhood where the Blazer was found, and
interviewed three people who had put out the fire with hoses.</TE>
<TE>   One was a woman who said she saw a beige pickup truck with three
men and two women inside parked in an alley an hour before the
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The group drove away shortly before the Blazer and a minivan
arrived, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I went outside and noticed an intense smell of gasoline in the
air," she said. "Then a young man got out of the minivan, walked up
to the Blazer and tossed something inside, which caused an explosion
of flames in the front seats."</TE>
<TE>   Blair said, "It is possible that the suspect had people waiting
for him in that alley. We're not ruling out anything."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Blair said, "it appeared the suspect had been waiting
for the armored car to arrive at the Jetro store."</TE>
<TE>   "As the courier walked out of the store, the suspect approached
from the parking lot with a handgun," she said. "The driver tried to
warn his partner, but was shot at and had to take cover."</TE>
<TE>   Seconds later, she said, "the courier was shot in the head at
close range."</TE>

<HD>Council Told Law Is on the Side of Billboard</HD>
<DH>Ads: Members are told statutes don't restrict vulgar
content like that in Westside posting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There isn't much the city can do about a raunchy record company
billboard that is causing an uproar on the Westside, legal and zoning
officials told the Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The news prompted Councilman Jack Weiss, who represents the area,
to consider proposing a local law restricting the content of
billboards near residential neighborhoods, schools and places of
worship.</LD>
<LD>   The council also voted 11 to 0 to send the matter to a committee
that will study the council's options regarding Tha Row Records'
billboard, which features a cartoon character sitting on a toilet and
a corresponding vulgarity. Tha Row Records was formerly known as
Death Row Records.</LD>
<TE>   The large advertisement, atop the record label's four-story
building at San Vicente and Wilshire boulevards, was put up against
the wishes of billboard owner Clear Channel Outdoor. The two
companies' attorneys are negotiating, but the council ordered an
official with Clear Channel to call police because armed guards for
the record company reportedly have stopped the billboard firm's crews
from getting to the billboard.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't let people with billboards and guns intimidate this
city," Weiss said. " ... We need to respond appropriately in a way
they understand."</TE>
<TE>   Tha Row's publicist said company officials had no immediate
comment.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing numerous complaints from residents and workers who
regularly see the massive advertisement, for a new release by Crooked
1, Weiss asked city legal and building officials to look into the
billboard's legality.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Keim, the city's chief of code enforcement, said a permit was
issued for the billboard structure in 1984, and "there's no provision
in our ... municipal code that allows me to regulate content."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Atty. Sharon Siedorf Cardenas added that the
billboard's scatological humor is of a type that is not considered
obscene under legal precedents.</TE>
<TE>   "For either the words or the picture to be obscene, it has to be
sexual content," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just using a four-letter word by itself or a depiction of someone
sitting on the toilet absent sexual connotation cannot be considered
obscene."</TE>
<TE>   Weiss, a former federal prosecutor, said he believed the city
attorney's report was flawed. He also said the council ought to
consider a narrowly tailored statute that would prohibit such
off-color billboards near schools, residential areas and places of
worship.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow council members said the body needed to tread lightly.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure, before we do anything, we don't just walk
all over the 1st Amendment and treat it lightly or disregard it,"
said Councilman Nick Pacheco.</TE>
<TE>   American Civil Liberties Union officials were confident the
ordinance would be thrown out by a court.</TE>
<TE>   "Just trying to protect people's sensibilities--that's not a
sufficient basis for restrictions on speech," said Peter Eliasberg,
the managing attorney in the ACLU's Southern California office. The
council "would be better off spending time on more productive things
and not waste the taxpayers' money passing unconstitutional laws."</TE>
<TE>   However, Councilman Dennis Zine said the issue at hand was not a
1st Amendment matter. "This is a hijacked billboard," he said.</TE>

<HD>How to Dispose of an Old Computer or Television Set in
California</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California no longer allows dumping of discarded televisions and
computer monitors in landfills because most contain lead and other
toxic materials, making them hazardous.</LD>
<LD>   There is no state or national program for disposing of electronic
waste, so residents looking to get rid of a monitor or television
should notify their city governments or local waste haulers. Most
cities have periodic hazardous-waste collection events in which they
take large trash bins to neighborhoods. Some are now organizing
events specifically for so-called e-waste.</LD>
<LD>   Customers may also want to notify the manufacturers of the
computers or televisions to see whether they offer take-back
programs.</LD>
<TE>   Some computer companies, including IBM and Hewlett-Packard, now
offer such programs, but charge for the service.</TE>

<HD>Plan to Raise Taxes on Rich Dies in Senate</HD>
<DH>Budget: Republicans stand fast and the Democrat-sponsored
proposal, which would have raised $2.7 billion, fails by a single
vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A plan by Senate Democrats to raise taxes on wealthy Californians to
help close a $23.6-billion budget gap failed in the Senate Tuesday,
amid Republican opposition.</LD>
<LD>   The $4.8-billion plan centered on a proposal by Senate Leader John
Burton (D-San Francisco) to raise $2.7 billion by increasing the
highest individual tax brackets from the current 9.3% by adding 10%
and 11% brackets. The measure failed to get the single Republican
vote needed to gain the required two-thirds approval in the Senate
and to send it on to the Assembly for consideration.</LD>
<LD>   When combined with revenues from a variety of other tax proposals,
the money would have funded an expansion of a health insurance
program to cover poor parents, bolstered fire protection, continued a
popular tax break enjoyed by motorists and paid for a juvenile crime
prevention program, among other proposals.</LD>
<TE>   Democratic leaders acknowledged that the plan would not solve
California's fiscal problems, but warned that the reduction in state
services that would be needed without an increase in taxes would be
too large.</TE>
<TE>   "When I look at what is not going to get funded ... I'll pay my
300 bucks," said the Senate Budget Committee chairman, Steve Peace
(D-El Cajon).</TE>
<TE>   For single filers, the 10% rate would have kicked in on incomes of
more than $130,000. The 11% rate would have applied to income of more
than $260,000. For joint filers, the 10% rate would have taken effect
at more than $260,000 and 11% at more than $520,000.</TE>
<TE>   A married filer with taxable income of $400,000 could have
expected to pay $980 in increased taxes from the 10% rate. Because
state taxes can be deducted on federal tax returns, the net increase
would be $601, Democrats said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not really going to send anyone to the poorhouse," Burton
said. He proceeded to tick off a list of programs dear to Republicans
that would be funded if the tax hike were approved, including money
to help small-county sheriffs and a program favored by
environmentalists and farmers that rewards landowners for keeping
parcels undeveloped.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, however, objected to the tax hikes and called for
more spending cuts to balance the budget. Sen. Tom McClintock
(R-Thousand Oaks) said his Democratic counterparts appeared to be
missing the larger picture.</TE>
<TE>   "This budget crisis is not the fault of the taxpayers for not
paying enough taxes," McClintock said. McClintock took issue with
what he described as the state's spending the largest portion of
people's earnings and delivering less with it.</TE>
<TE>   "Their only solution is to raise taxes," McClintock said of
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Republican leader, Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga,
blamed a rise in state spending under Gov. Gray Davis for
California's budget problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor has taken us from the largest surplus in California
history to the largest deficit in California history," Brulte said.</TE>
<TE>   But Peace, the budget committee chairman, said that the growth in
state spending has been focused on programs supported by Republicans
and Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Peace said that the spending increase separating the two parties
comes down to, at most, $2.5 billion for health-care programs.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project, a
group that lobbies for the poor during budget negotiations, had
previously said that the top 1% of California taxpayers would still
have come out ahead under Burton's plan when federal tax breaks were
taken into account.</TE>
<TE>   Such households, according to Ross, would have received an average
federal tax cut of $51,717 when it was fully phased in, compared with
a state tax increase of $7,674 under the Burton proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Davis opposes Burton's plan. The governor instead favors a
proposal to essentially double vehicle license fees paid by
motorists, which would raise $1.3 billion in the fiscal year
beginning July 1 and a similar amount in the following year. Davis
noted when he released his revised budget last month that the top 5%
of taxpayers already generate 70% of revenues from stock options and
capital gains.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's tax plan also called for a suspension of a tax
deduction enjoyed by businesses, a 50-cent increase in taxes on
cigarettes and suspension of tax credits for teachers and owners of
solar energy systems. The plan would restore $3.7 billion earmarked
for local governments to replace money they would lose as a result of
the state's reduction in vehicle license fees.</TE>
<TE>   In the Assembly, lawmakers expect to take up a similar budget
package on Thursday, even as a standoff continues between lower-house
Republicans and Democrats over a plan by Davis to shift about $1.7
billion in school funding to help balance the budget. The measure
would need four Republican votes to achieve the required two-thirds
majority, and GOP members have refused to vote for it after Democrats
rejected a request to earmark about $1 billion for school-related
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and lawmakers are facing a Sunday deadline if they are to
have a new spending plan in place for the start of the new fiscal
year.</TE>

<HD>40,000 Winners, Losers Open Temecula Casino</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Camila Bailon, 67, softly stroked the video screen as if it were a
newborn child, running her hands over the spinning fruits and lucky
7s and murmuring with pleasure.</LD>
<LD>   Bailon, of Los Angeles, was among the estimated 40,000 people who
thronged to opening night Monday at the Pechanga Resort and Casino in
Temecula, a mammoth Las Vegas-style operation that is now the largest
Indian-owned casino west of the Mississippi.</LD>
<LD>   Jubilant leaders from the Pechanga band of Luiseno Mission
Indians, who along with other tribes poured millions into political
campaigns and spent years lobbying federal, state and local officials
to allow Vegas-style gambling, are already pushing for expansion.</LD>
<TE>   "Two-thousand slot machines in Pechanga is not enough!" tribal
chairman Mark Maccaro said at the ribbon cutting.</TE>
<TE>   The gleaming, $262-million, 13-story facility is billed as
California's answer to Las Vegas, with a 522-room hotel, an
88,000-square-foot casino, 40,000 square feet of meeting space and a
1,200-seat theater.</TE>
<TE>   Billboards and radio ads proclaim that Temecula is about an hour
from much of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "We are basically giving folks the alternative to getting in your
car and driving five to eight hours to Las Vegas," said Dual Cooper,
Pechanga's general manager.</TE>
<TE>   But opening-night traffic was "absolute gridlock," according to
California Highway Patrol Officer Jack Mears. Vehicles were backed up
for 10 miles on Interstate 15.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper said traffic flow would improve, with daily attendance
expected to range between 7,000 and 12,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Indian gaming casinos in California--there are now nearly 50--have
been booming since the passage of Proposition 1A two years ago. But
industry analysts also say California has a way to go before it
rivals Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "People aren't going to be saying, 'Cancel my vacation to
Vegas--I'm going to Pechanga,' " said Bill Thompson, a professor of
public administration at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who has
written six books on American gambling.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the tribe has an ideal location close to a major
freeway and could well capture a chunk of the estimated 20% of all
Las Vegas gamblers who drive there on Interstate 15.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Feldman, senior vice president at the Mirage in Las Vegas,
noted that there are close to 125,000 hotel rooms and scores of
restaurants in that city, and that tourists can walk from one casino
to the next.</TE>
<TE>   "The mass of all of the casinos together is what gives [Vegas] its
power," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "California is clearly, under direction of Gov. Gray
Davis, emerging as one of the largest gaming states in America."</TE>
<TE>   Davis worked with California tribes to forge legal gambling
compacts.</TE>
<TE>   After Las Vegas casino operators successfully sued to block a
measure that would have allowed unlimited gambling facilities,
California Indian gaming representatives championed Proposition 1A,
which allowed more restricted gambling. It passed overwhelmingly.</TE>
<TE>   The Pechanga casino originally opened in 1995 in a cluster of
trailers and tents. Tribal leaders played key roles in the statewide
campaign for passage of Proposition 1A.</TE>
<TE>   By 6 p.m. Monday, thousands of people were straining at metal
gates, eager to get inside. A few minutes before 8, the doors were
opened.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of senior citizens using walkers and wheelchairs pushed
along with other would-be bettors.</TE>
<TE>   "Grab a wall unless you want to get stampeded," said Laurel
Buchanan, 23, a blackjack dealer who lives in Temecula and is paying
for college on her earnings of about $160 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Some Native Americans said they wished the revenues could come
from something other than gambling.</TE>
<TE>   "I have mixed feelings," said Minnie Tafoya, who has lived in
Temecula for close to 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I know gambling is addictive.... [But] I can see already what
money has done for this community.... Now the elderly have a cultural
center, and the children have a new school."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inside the cluttered library of 32nd Street Magnet School, a
kindergarten-through-12th-grade campus, a magazine rack displayed an
issue of Seventeen, with articles such as "Straight vs. Curly, What
Boys Want." The teen magazine sat next to an issue of Highlights for
Children, which featured an article on hopscotch.</LD>
<LD>   Just outside, a second-grade boy played kickball with classmates
and almost bumped into a high school student, who towered over him.</LD>
<LD>   Two elementary school girls entered a bathroom, in which stalls
were coated with cream-colored paint to cover some profanities now
barely visible. In one stall graffiti read: "For a good time
call...."</LD>
<TE>   This tiny, fenced campus in the shadow of USC, south of
downtown Los Angeles, is home to two magnet schools under one principal
and one name. A 270-student high school math, science and technology
magnet moved onto the campus about 10 years ago, joining a
700-student kindergarten-through-eighth-grade visual and performing
arts magnet.</TE>
<TE>   It is one of only five campuses in the Los Angeles Unified School
District to have all grade school ages. Statewide, there are only 65
public schools with kindergarten-through-12th-grade enrollment, and
most have fewer than 1,000 students, according to data from the
California Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Foshay Learning Center, an academically acclaimed campus in
South-Central Los Angeles, is the largest such school in the state,
with 3,600 students.</TE>
<TE>   Kindergarten-through-12th- grade campuses are often effective in
relatively small settings like 32nd Street, said David Marsh,
associate dean of USC's Rossier School of Education. Such
environments allow teachers to get to know students as they grow
older, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course we need to protect younger kids from things older kids
do," he said. "But we can't take that concern and let it justify
large schools that isolate kids of a particular age."</TE>
<TE>   Marsh, who has visited 32nd Street School, said it provides a
family-like environment where upperclassmen often act like older
brothers and sisters to younger children.</TE>
<TE>   Although age groups are separated for academics, the
students cross paths between classes, during the nutrition break, before
school and during assemblies.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, staff members say, everyone gets along. Older
students tutor younger students after school. Big kids shield little
kids from bullies. Impressionable children admire trendy teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   But allowing a wide range of ages on such a confined campus has
caused concern among some parents, such as Dan Hart, who has a
10-year-old foster daughter, Valerie Vidal, at the school. Once,
Valerie asked why girls walked around with the top buttons of their
pants undone. He said of the provocative fad: "That's their style, I
guess. But you're not going to do that."</TE>
<TE>   During lunch, called nutrition, high school students take over the
back of the campus, sitting at circular tables. Elementary students
sit at covered, outdoor lunch tables near the front of the campus.
Middle school students congregate at benches in between peach and
orange bungalows that are covered with murals depicting ballerinas,
flowers and musical notes.</TE>
<TE>   "If a high schooler hangs here, they know they can't hang here,
because this is our spot," said Tatiana Williams, 13. "Not according
to teachers, according to us."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps concerns about age intermixing would be lessened if the
campus were expanded, said Timothy Miller, director of middle schools
for local Subdistrict G, who oversees 32nd Street. The school lacks a
sports field, playground equipment, a gymnasium and an auditorium
large enough for everyone. Students use USC's gym and library
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it's a K-12 program, there are such diverse
needs," Miller said. "Our younger kids needs swings and teeter-totters....
High school students need baseball fields and a track."</TE>
<TE>   Miller said he plans to ask the district to build additional
facilities on the campus if voters approve a $3.3-billion L.A.
Unified school construction bond in November and receive additional
funds from a $13-billion state school bond on the same ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Principal Gail Greer said parents often worry about the range of
ages at the school, but then find out that it offers a caring, safe
environment. Besides, because the school is home to two magnets, each
with limited space and long waiting lists, anyone caught bullying or
causing trouble may be sent to another campus.</TE>
<TE>   Parents line up to apply for 32nd Street, which offers a range of
outreach programs and tutors with the help of USC. As conceived 20
years ago, magnet schools like 32nd Street were intended to improve
integration by offering specialized programs in areas such as math
and science, art, language and the humanities to attract a diverse
student body.</TE>
<TE>   Greer said the campus operates on these rules: High school
students take care of middle school students. Middle school students
take care of elementary pupils. And elementary pupils tell on
everyone.</TE>
<TE>   And tell they do.</TE>
<TE>   High school students "write bad things in the bathrooms," Amani
Odom, 10, said. "They're not supposed to bring cell phones, but they
do."</TE>
<TE>   "They make out everywhere!" said Brandon Bobo, 9. "Sometimes they
mess with us and take our money in the bathroom if we're alone."</TE>
<TE>   "They tease us. They say, 'You're very little,' " said
second-grade student Alexis Mendez, 8. "Sometimes they say, 'You're
ugly.' "</TE>
<TE>   Tatiana Williams, a middle school student, explained the social
pecking order. "If you talk to the high schoolers, then you're
considered popular," she said. "But if you talk to the little kids,
they think you're a nerd and have no friends."</TE>
<TE>   High school students have their gripes too: "For nutrition, you
just wanna walk around, and they're running around and bumping into
you," said Nick Harrington, 16. But he added that it is nice having
some youngsters look up to him.</TE>
<TE>   The comfy campus enables teachers to get to know most students,
and sometimes watch them grow from small children into young adults.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Iris Casco, 18, has attended 32nd Street since
kindergarten. She has a sister in 11th grade and two 12-year-old
cousins at the school. She frequently checks up on them to make sure
they are not being bullied and are getting good grades.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Melendez, 18, also a senior, said she sees how older
students influence younger ones, for bad and good. For example, she
often notices little girls caking on makeup.</TE>
<TE>   But she goes out of her way to befriend some little ones and hug
them. "It makes them feel good, because it shows them that even
though we're older, we can talk to them," she said.</TE>

<HD>Paying to Junk TVs, Monitors</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Bills would have California collect money at
the time of sale to cover disposal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- California would become the first state to impose a fee
on the sales of computers and televisions to pay for their future
disposal, under sweeping legislation aimed at managing hazardous
electronic waste.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning in 2004, the state would assess a fee of as much as $30
on the sale of every new computer and TV set to help cities and trash
companies finance collection and recycling. The legislation also
would require a warning label on every new computer and television to
disclose the hazardous materials contained inside, and would
establish a public education campaign to persuade consumers to
recycle them.</LD>
<LD>   Unknown to many consumers, TV sets and personal computers contain
numerous toxic materials. Discarding the growing heaps of outdated
models in an environmentally safe manner poses a challenge across the
country.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, California quietly prohibited landfills from accepting
any more TVs or computer monitors, after concluding they constituted
hazardous waste.</TE>
<TE>   Most such items contain four to eight pounds of lead apiece. About
10,000 of them are discarded in the state every day and only an
estimated 5% to 15% are recycled. Yet California, like all other
states, lacks a strategy for getting rid of them.</TE>
<TE>   Measures by state Sens. Byron Sher of Stanford and Gloria Romero
of Los Angeles, both Democrats, would treat the discarded devices
like used bottles, cans and tires.</TE>
<TE>   "If you walk into Circuit City or Good Guys today, you are going
to find the latest, fastest computer and you know, two or three years
from now, it is going to be in the trash somewhere," Romero said. "We
all want the newest technology. It's out with the old, in with the
new. But until the new becomes environmentally friendly, we are
ending up with a stockpile of hazardous waste."</TE>
<TE>   Both measures have cleared the Senate and are in the Assembly, but
they are opposed by an array of business interests, leaving their
prospects for final passage uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   This week, in fact, both measures nearly died in the Assembly
Natural Resources Committee, which passed the bills only after
stripping them of most details and ordering opponents and supporters
to reopen negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Several computer and television trade groups are working to defeat
the bills (SB 1523 and SB 1619), arguing that the state should wait
for a national electronics recycling standard. And some in-state
manufacturers, such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard, worry that a
California fee would give an edge to out-of-state competitors, such
as Gateway and Dell, whose Internet sales might be outside the
state's reach.</TE>
<TE>   'A Fairness Issue'</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers who purchase computers at retail outlets in California
will pay this $30 fee, and consumers who choose to purchase their
computers over the Internet will not," said Heather Bowman of the
Electronics Industries Alliance, a Washington trade group active in
the California fight.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a fairness issue. California retailers are already at a
disadvantage because of the sales tax [which is not charged on
out-of-state Internet purchases], and this would only make it worse."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of a state recycling fee, although acknowledging that a
national solution would make more sense, say California may have to
act first, as it has done on other environmental issues.</TE>
<TE>   They say it is time for computer makers to embrace what they
believe is a moral obligation to ensure that the products they sell
do not contribute to pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The fee, supporters say, would nurture a growing computer
recycling industry and end the technology world's dirty little secret
about what happens to the detritus of the Information Age.</TE>
<TE>   Much of America's electronic waste now makes its way to China,
India and Pakistan, where computers and TV sets are crudely
disassembled and scrapped for parts by untrained peasants, polluting
ground water and endangering human health, environmentalists assert.</TE>
<TE>   A recent documentary on the practice shot by environmental groups,
"Exporting Harm: The High-Tech Trashing of Asia," showed Chinese
villagers, including children, scavenging old computers with ID tags
from the city of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Unified School
District.</TE>
<TE>   The footage surprised Los Angeles school officials, who said they
did not know how their computer junk had made it across the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an issue that should already have been addressed," said
Sher, who represents much of the Silicon Valley area. "This is a
problem that is giving this industry a black eye, not only here but
throughout the world."</TE>
<TE>   Since its inception, one of the central tenets of the computer
industry has been that equipment will be replaced early and often as
better technology becomes available.</TE>
<TE>   The side effect of that constant turnover--piles upon piles of
obsolete computers--is only now attracting government scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   For years, many consumers handed old computers down to relatives
or donated them to charities or schools. But as computer use has
skyrocketed and technological progress has continued to soar, those
outlets for older computers have begun to disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Many thrift shops have stopped accepting computers and televisions
altogether, concluding that chances of finding new users are slim and
the cost of discarding them is too steep.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, trash companies report increasing numbers of
computers and televisions being discarded. Officials also say there
is a "silent stockpile" of millions more in garages and attics around
the country, waiting to be discarded.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report by the state's Integrated Waste Management Board
estimated that, in California households alone, there are 6 million
computer and TV monitors collecting dust.</TE>
<TE>   "What has become clear in the past decade is that electronics are
disposable goods," said Mark Murray, executive director of
Californians Against Waste, chief sponsor of the measures.</TE>
<TE>   "In practice, computers and televisions are disposable products
that, in a few years, become completely worthless."</TE>
<TE>   Several Western European nations have passed laws requiring
electronics recycling, and the European Union has begun to address
the problem more broadly, with legislation requiring manufacturers to
pay for take-back programs. Japan already has such a law for
televisions and appliances.</TE>
<TE>   But the United States, by far the world's largest consumer of
electronic goods, lags behind.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of industry leaders, environmentalists, recyclers and
government officials is working to develop a nationwide solution that
would include front-end fees, like those proposed in California.
However, the group, the National Electronics Product Stewardship
Initiative, is not expected to reach consensus for at least another
year.</TE>
<TE>   Like several other companies, Panasonic has been working to reduce
the number of toxins in its televisions and building them with more
reusable materials, as well as forming partnerships with recyclers
and government agencies to sponsor take-back programs.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report commissioned by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency found that 40% of the lead found in the nation's landfills is
suspected to have come from electronic equipment, most from the
cathode ray tubes found in TV and computer monitors. Lead can leach
out of landfills, government studies have shown, polluting
surrounding soil and ground water.</TE>
<TE>   Computers also contain small amounts of mercury, cadmium and
barium, among other potentially hazardous materials.</TE>
<TE>   While many environmental groups praised California for following
the example of Massachusetts and banning TVs and computer monitors
from landfills last year, the move surprised many cities and waste
haulers, who suddenly found themselves footing the bill for tons of
hazardous waste they had no place to send.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got this prohibition to send them to landfills, yet there
is no place for them to go and they are piling up. It's leading to a
lot of illegal dumping, unfortunately," said Denise Delmatier, vice
president of government affairs at Norcal Waste, one of the state's
largest trash companies.</TE>
<TE>   Norcal is spending $35 to $40 per unit to send computers and
televisions to HMR Group, a company that breaks them down and sends
the scrap to various recyclers, but Norcal cannot afford to do that
forever, Delmatier said.</TE>
<TE>   At HMR Group's cavernous central processing facility in
Sacramento, business is clearly booming since the California landfill
ban. Discarded computers and televisions arrive by the trailer load
from Los Angeles and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The $30 recycling fee proposed in California is intended to
finance grants that would help cities, trash haulers, nonprofit
groups and others cover the cost of collecting TVs and computers and,
possibly, recycling them. The state would collect the fee and dole
out the grants. But San Francisco officials say it costs them nearly
$60 just to prepare a wood-paneled television for recycling.</TE>
<TE>   Legality Questioned</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, meanwhile, question whether the state could legally
levy such fees on Dell and other out-of-state companies that do
business over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   A recent letter from a state Board of Equalization staff member to
a lobbyist for the computer industry lent credence to that argument,
concluding there were legal as well as practical problems with
collecting fees from companies with no physical presence in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, supporters insist the fee is legally sound and they
stress that something must be done to address a problem that is only
likely to get worse. "It should be as easy to recycle a computer as
it is to buy one. And it should be free," said Robert Haley,
recycling coordinator for the San Francisco Department of the
Environment. "Because, otherwise, people are going to continue taking
the easy way out, which is to leave these things on a street corner."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Grand Jury Accuses D.A. of Conflicts in Cases</HD>
<DH>Probe: Report says Tony Rackauckas intervened at campaign
donors' requests. He 'has nothing to hide,' spokeswoman says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas interceded on behalf of
campaign contributors in three criminal cases handled by his office,
according to a grand jury report to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   The cases cited by the panel include that of a domestic violence
suspect Rackauckas ordered dismissed and one in which an auto
burglary suspect's 16 felony charges were reduced to a single
misdemeanor. In each case, Rackauckas intervened after he was
contacted by a campaign contributor, the report states.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Grand Jury also criticizes Rackauckas and his
managers of using county resources for personal business. In one
instance, an investigator was assigned to stake out the home of
Rackauckas' adult son when his father feared he might be driving on a
suspended license.</LD>
<TE>   The grand jury accused Rackauckas of acting with an "appearance of
impropriety" but stopped short of accusing him of criminal
wrongdoing. It did recommend that he be barred from making hiring
decisions because in the past he selected relatives of friends and
contributors.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors, which received the report
Tuesday, hastily scheduled a special meeting for Friday to discuss
the findings.</TE>
<TE>   "If some of the allegations contained in this report are
sustained, there could be significant fallout and significant
mistrust of our criminal justice system," Supervisor Todd Spitzer
said. "It's significant enough in my opinion that we need to address
it as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   The panel spent eight months probing the office after receiving
complaints and letters. Aided by a deputy state attorney general, the
panel issued subpoenas to current and former employees of the
department to testify about allegations of misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The study represents the most serious accusations yet against
Rackauckas, who has been criticized by political opponents and some
employees for what they say is favoritism in cases involving friends
and contributors.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Rackauckas said he would not comment until the
report was officially released.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney is under a legal obligation not to discuss
this report until a grand jury makes it public. Whoever released this
report ... has broken the law," spokeswoman Tori Richards said. "Mr.
Rackauckas has nothing to hide and will answer questions regarding
issues brought up in this report when it becomes a public document."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing. Rather, he
accuses a handful of disgruntled prosecutors left over from his
predecessor's administration of waging a political vendetta against
him.</TE>
<TE>   Up to now, Rackauckas and his supporters have characterized the
grand jury's secret proceedings as part of a routine audit of the
office. But the report, titled "Office of the District Attorney, an
In-Depth Investigation," appears anything but routine. The report
praised Rackauckas for improvements in fighting gang crime and
family-support collections but also cited numerous concerns, among
them:</TE>
<TE>   * Rackauckas ordered his deputies to dismiss a domestic violence
case after a campaign contributor arranged for him to meet with the
victim, who said she had made up the allegations, the report said.
The report noted that it is common for victims of domestic violence
to recant and that the office's policy is to pursue charges in such
cases.</TE>
<TE>   * Rackauckas allegedly interceded in a second case after he was
contacted by a prominent Orange County defense attorney who had
contributed to his campaign. The suspect in the case was charged with
16 felonies involving a series of automobile burglaries and thefts
and a school burglary.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, the campaign contributor met with
Rackauckas to discuss the case and the district attorney soon
assigned a senior prosecutor to take over plea negotiations.
Ultimately, the defendant paid less than $2,000 in restitution and
all felony charges were dismissed, the report states.</TE>
<TE>   * Rackauckas got involved in a consumer-protection case against an
apartment business owned by billionaire developer George Argyros,
whose company donated to Rackauckas' campaign. Rackauckas took over
negotiations with Argyros' company. After his actions became public,
he withdrew from the case and asked the attorney general to take
over.</TE>
<TE>   * Rackauckas intervened in a case involving a close friend and
campaign contributor, Newport Beach businessman Patrick DiCarlo.
DiCarlo came to Rackauckas alleging that someone was trying to extort
money from him. The district attorney ordered his organized crime
investigators to look into the matter. But Rackauckas pulled the
investigators off the case weeks later, saying they were treating
DiCarlo more like a crime suspect than a victim. While the office was
investigating DiCarlo, Rackauckas presented his friend with a handgun
worth $600 as a birthday present, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   * The panel also accused Rackauckas of changing office hiring
policy to ensure that job candidates who were friends or relatives of
a political supporter would obtain interviews.</TE>
<TE>   At least one highly qualified office intern was passed over for
deputy prosecutor jobs given to candidates whose family members were
political supporters of Rackauckas, the report states. The grand jury
took the unusual step of recommending that Rackauckas no longer be
allowed to participate in hiring decisions.</TE>
<TE>   The report also examined actions by members of Rackauckas'
executive team, including Donald Blankenship, chief of the office's
investigative department.</TE>
<TE>   Blankenship ordered one of his commanders to investigate whether a
car driven by Blankenship's son was towed illegally when removed from
a library parking lot, the report concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were also ordered to probe the disappearance of the
boyfriend of Blankenship's daughter, even though the Orange County
Sheriff's Department was already investigating the matter, the report
said. The man eventually returned home from a trip to Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   A District Attorney's Special Fund, which was designed to pay for
undercover work by investigators and to protect witnesses, was
misused by Blankenship to pay for bar tabs and meals with lobbyists,
politicians, campaign consultants and reporters, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Blankenship spent $4,623.45 on those meetings, all of
which was approved by Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, Blankenship double-billed the county by also
accepting per diem expenses for the same meals, according to the
grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   Blankenship declined to comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The panel called on officials to investigate Blankenship's expense
billing to determine if he needs to repay the office.</TE>
<TE>   Criticism of Rackauckas began last year, when three prosecutors in
his office flew to Sacramento to urge state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer
to investigate him.</TE>
<TE>   The accusations against Rackauckas reached a peak earlier this
year during a heated reelection campaign in which the district
attorney's challenger, prosecutor Wally Wade, repeatedly attacked his
boss' integrity but lost in a landslide.</TE>

<HD>Bald Eagles Released on Island but Soaring Can Wait</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The triumphant return of bald eagles to Channel Islands National Park
was somewhat muted Tuesday morning when the four young raptors
refused to leave their nesting boxes on Santa Cruz Island, where they
have spent the past five weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The boxes were opened as a crowd watched from a foggy hillside,
but the eagles didn't budge, preferring to dither on their perches
instead. Park officials said one bird finally flew out about 7 p.m.
and was last seen standing on the grass near the 15-foot tower
supporting the nesting boxes.</LD>
<LD>   "The point is, today the birds are free, the doors are open," park
spokesman Tom Dore said. "It's selfish of us to expect a show."</LD>
<TE>   The release of the birds marks the first time in 50 years that
bald eagles have been free to roam the national park, as their
ancestors did before being driven off by DDT poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   The first four eaglets--Sam, Gimpy, Big Mama and Chatty--are
pioneers in a five-year effort to restore bald eagles to the island.
These first birds will be joined by eight more later this year. The
goal is to release 12 eagles annually for the next five years on the
65,000-acre island, park officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We think these will be a good core group that will stay here,"
said David Garcelon, president of the Institute for Wildlife Studies
in Arcata, which is managing the eagle program. "Wherever eagles
learn to fly is the place they tend to regard as home."</TE>
<TE>   Each of the 12-week-old eagles has a satellite transmitter
strapped to its back and a blue patch with a number under its wing to
help track its movements. Garcelon said bald eagles restored to Santa
Catalina Island in 1980 have traveled to Oregon, Washington, Nevada
and Northern California, but usually return to the island, which is
not part of the park chain.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Cruz eagles, which were hatched at the San Francisco
Zoo, seemed itching to fly Tuesday. They flapped in their boxes and
stared into misty Chinese Harbor, 800 feet down the hillside.
Biologists caring for the eagles say they have flapped so hard they
actually hovered like helicopters in their boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no fear that they will fly when the time comes," biologist
Jessica Dooley said.</TE>
<TE>   The project's funding comes from a $140-million settlement reached
in 2000 between the government and Montrose Chemical Co. in Torrance.
The business was accused of dumping millions of pounds of toxic DDT
and PCBs into the ocean near Los Angeles from 1947 until 1972.</TE>
<TE>   The chemicals poisoned fish and mammals, and caused the eggshells
of birds like the bald eagle to get so thin they wouldn't hatch.</TE>

<HD>Bald Eagles Set Free but Soaring Will Have to Wait</HD>
<DH>Conservation: Four young birds are released in an effort to

<TE>   The Santa Cruz eagles, which were hatched at the San Francisco

stared into misty Chinese Harbor, 800 feet down the hillside.

<TE>   "I have no fear that they will fly when the time comes," biologist

<TE>   The project's funding comes from a $140-million settlement reached

<TE>   The business was accused of dumping millions of pounds of toxic
DDT and PCBs into the ocean near Los Angeles from 1947 until 1972.</TE>
<TE>   The chemicals poisoned fish and mammals, and caused the eggshells
of birds like the bald eagle to get so thin they wouldn't hatch.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife managers say 110 million tons of poisons remain in the
ocean and $30 million from the settlement will be used in an attempt
to restore species and habitats that were lost.</TE>
<TE>   After the bald eagle disappeared, predators like the golden eagle
took its place. Golden eagles prey on the endangered island fox and
feral pigs. Starting in 1995, the foxes were rounded up and put into
kennels to protect them from the golden eagles, which are being
captured and removed from the island as part of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists believe bald eagles have a good chance of thriving on
Santa Cruz because they are farther from the DDT contamination than
the 20 eagles on Catalina Island, which are still badly affected by
the toxins. Only about 30% of the eagle eggs on Catalina have
hatched.</TE>
<TE>   "The sources of food for these eagles are about three times less
contaminated here than on Catalina, particularly if they don't make a
habit of scavenging on marine mammals, which have the highest doses
of DDT," said Daniel Welsh, contaminants coordinator for the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service in Sacramento. "Fish and pig carcasses are
clean."</TE>
<TE>   The bald eagles' reluctance to fly the coop is not unusual in bird
releases, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Garcelon recalled an eagle release in which the bird lingered in
its cage for a week. Others spent hours or several days before taking
their first, often-clumsy flight.</TE>
<TE>   The birds will be fed pig carcasses and fish for a month or so
until they can find their own food.</TE>
<TE>   Before opening the doors to the boxes, Chumash storyteller Julie
Tumamait-Stenslie prayed for the birds.</TE>
<TE>   Her great-grandfather was born and raised on Santa Cruz Island.
The Indians called it Limu, or "In the Sea," and revered the eagle as
the wot, or chief of all birds who held up the world with its wings,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   With eagle feathers in her hand, she asked that the birds be
watched over and kept from harm.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked the Creator to let them flourish here," she said.</TE>

<HD>Supervisor's Vote Shift May Delay Sale of El Toro</HD>
<DH>Land use: After a deal to fund parkland fails, Cynthia Coad
withdraws support for annexation of base by Irvine. Property's fate
may be unclear until next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plan to speed Irvine's annexation of the closed El Toro Marine base
collapsed Tuesday after a key county supervisor withdrew her support,
a move that could hamper the property's transfer and delay its sale
by the Navy for six months or more.</LD>
<LD>   Board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad rescinded her swing vote allowing
the county to negotiate annexation details with the city, including
how property tax revenue would be split. A majority of the
five-member board must approve annexation before land can be
transferred.</LD>
<LD>   Until Coad's April vote favoring annexation, three board members
had supported developing an airport at the closed base.</LD>
<TE>   Navy officials said last week they won't complete the sale of any
property until after the land is annexed to Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Coad's defection may set back any resolution of the base's fate
until early 2003 or later. She leaves the board at year's end, and
Supervisor Todd Spitzer is expected to win election easily in
November to the state Assembly, leaving the board with a vacancy in
January that must be filled by a special election.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has supported Irvine's annexation of the base.</TE>
<TE>   Coad said her original vote for annexation was based on a pledge
by Irvine that it would provide $800,000 a year from the development
of El Toro for purchase and maintenance of parks in her north Orange
County district. After Irvine passed three deadlines to deliver a
legally binding agreement for the money, Coad said Tuesday she was
giving up.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot support the annexation," Coad told fellow supervisors at
Tuesday's board meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Her successor, Supervisor-elect Chris Norby, has backed her idea
of money for North County parks but also supports Irvine's desire to
annex the base. Norby was out of town and unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   For eight years, county officials, including Coad, pushed for an
airport at the 4,700-acre former Marine base. In March, voters
rezoned the property from an airport to parkland and limited
development after Irvine pledged to build a large park on the
grounds. A month later, county supervisors agreed to turn over
control of the land to Irvine, which isn't bound by the new zoning,
but has pledged to honor its "spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Councilman Chris Mears on Tuesday accused Coad of promoting
"her own narrow-minded airport agenda" by delaying the process and
hoping that a Los Angeles County judge rules quickly on a lawsuit
challenging the March vote on Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy wants to sell the property in cooperation with Irvine and
use the proceeds to support the nation's military budget, Mears said.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter sent to county officials last week, the Navy's
assistant secretary for installations urged the county to approve the
annexation so the property can be redeveloped by the new owners
without delay.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine said in April that it hoped to begin the annexation process
formally in September, armed with a preannexation agreement signed
with the county. The city now believes it cannot begin the process
until December at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   But even if the city prevails with the county Local Agency
Formation Commission, the county's elected leaders must approve an
annexation.</TE>

<HD>Davis Adds Forces for Fire Season</HD>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis took steps Tuesday to beef up California's
firefighting ranks and equipment as the state prepares to face one of
the most dangerous fire seasons in years.</LD>
<LD>   As summer's temperatures rise, so do concerns that the combination
of unusually low winter rainfall and dry brush have primed the state
for fires like those in Colorado and Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   In an executive order, Davis increased California Department of
Forestry engine teams from three to four firefighters per unit and
added 10 refurbished firetrucks to serve Los Angeles, Orange,
Ventura, Santa Barbara and Kern counties.</LD>
<TE>   "I am taking this proactive step during this extraordinary fire
season to ensure that the people and resources of the state have the
best protection possible," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The order also added four Forestry Department Conservation Camp
Fire crews in Southern California, provided a leased helicopter for
San Diego County and activated 10 more fire lookout towers in the
northern part of the state. Davis said the increases will cost $6
million to $10 million, depending on the severity of the fire season.</TE>
<TE>   A similar order last summer cost the state $9.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who is running for reelection against Republican Bill Simon
Jr., signed the order at the Office of Emergency Services.</TE>

<HD>Web Gambling Bill Dies in Legislature</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>For the third year in a row, a bill to ban Internet gambling in
California has died in the state Legislature--this time amid
behind-the-scenes lobbying from Indian gambling interests that are
considering entering the lucrative online business.</LD>
<LD>   The measure by Assemblyman Dario Frommer (D-Los Feliz) died
without a vote Tuesday in the Senate Governmental Organization
Committee, the panel that deals with tobacco, alcohol and gambling
bills. No legislator would second a motion to consider it, ending its
prospects under the parliamentary rules that govern legislative
debates.</LD>
<LD>   Native American tribes, which were granted the right to offer slot
machines and expand gambling operations by California voters in 1998,
did not testify at the hearing. But some lobbied vigorously to defeat
Assembly Bill 1229 because they are interested in offering Internet
gambling, legislators said.</LD>
<TE>   "My reaction is really one of disbelief," Frommer said afterward.
"Two years ago, that same committee passed a very similar bill by
[Assembly Speaker] Herb Wesson. The only difference is that we now
have a powerful Indian group in opposition."</TE>
<TE>   Congress has debated and defeated a number of measures to prohibit
Internet gambling in recent years, in part over concerns that such
legislation would be difficult to enforce. Most Internet gambling
sites are run from islands in the Caribbean and other offshore
destinations that make them difficult for American authorities to
regulate.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Frommer argues that with a state Internet gambling
ban, California prosecutors could prevent businesses from targeting
the state's residents, and place pressure on credit card companies
that aid gambling.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way to know whether when you roll the dice" through
the computer on an Internet gambling site, "you have a fair chance,"
Frommer said. "Every indication is that these sites are very
addictive. We have no control over it. We've seen people lose
hundreds of thousands of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   A number of law enforcement organizations and anti-gambling groups
supported Frommer's legislation, which was originally tabled in the
Senate last year. Frommer also enjoyed support from the state's
horseracing interests, which are permitted to offer online gambling
services under legislation Wesson carried last year.</TE>
<TE>   But, according to Frommer and other members of the committee, the
bill was opposed by Indian gaming groups.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada passed a law last year that allows Las Vegas casinos to
operate Internet sites in states where online gambling is legal, and
some Indian casinos feel a need to follow suit for competitive
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the California Nations Indian Gaming Assn., the
main group opposing the measure, did not respond Tuesday to requests
for comment.</TE>

<HD>Hundreds Protest Zoning Proposal</HD>
<DH>Urban renewal: Garden Grove considers adding to
redevelopment zone. Official says residents are in no immediate
danger of losing their homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 600 residents packed a rowdy Garden Grove City Council meeting
Tuesday night as officials considered an ambitious redevelopment plan
that could threaten hundreds of homes.</LD>
<LD>   The residents, carrying signs that read "Save Our Homes," "Don't
Steal Our American Dream" and "No Eminent Domain," pleaded with the
council to vote down a proposal to add 195 acres to the redevelopment
zone.</LD>
<LD>   The area, which mostly borders Harbor Boulevard, encompasses 500
single-family homes, 300 mobile homes, 120 apartment units and 30
businesses. If a developer wants to build hotels, restaurants or a
theme park, those residents could be forced out.</LD>
<TE>   "The only way they're going to get me out of my house is in a
coffin. I'm going to die there," Peter Castro, 75, a Garden Grove
resident for 50 years, said at the hearing. "My kids were born there.
They were raised there. That's a lot of family history."</TE>
<TE>   The council's vote on the proposal is scheduled for Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   City Manager George Tindall said the residents have been
misinformed. No developer has a proposal for the area.</TE>
<TE>   "This has nothing to do with buying people's homes," Tindall said.
"This is a tough policy issue for the city. Someone's got to look
[out] on behalf of the city long term."</TE>
<TE>   City officials want to boost tax revenue in the city by cashing in
on neighboring Disneyland in Anaheim and on Anaheim's other tourist
attractions.</TE>
<TE>   In the past few years, developers cut lucrative deals with Garden
Grove that have resulted in the addition of 2,000 new hotel rooms.
Assistant City Manager Matt Fertal said those hotels bring in $4
million to $5 million in annual bed-tax revenue for Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Bruce Broadwater wants to continue that development.
Broadwater has said he envisions a Harbor Boulevard lined with
hotels, stretching from the Fullerton city line, passing through
Anaheim and continuing through Garden Grove.</TE>

<HD>Delay Sought in Health Care Cuts</HD>
<DH>Budget: Activists ask supervisors to phase in cost-saving
measures, due to be made today. Board says deadline is now for
action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of labor, clergy and political leaders Tuesday accused
Los Angeles County supervisors of preparing to cut health care to the
uninsured as a ploy to get more money from the state and federal
governments.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't say, 'OK, we're going to let poor people die and this
will wake up the state and [federal government],' " said former Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who was among those urging supervisors
to postpone the service reductions they are slated to make today.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors will consider a plan to cut $150 million from their
sprawling health system, reducing hospital beds by 29% and outpatient
care by 26% and eliminating 5,000 positions. The county has enough
money on hand to keep the department at full strength through next
year, but declining federal funds leave it with a projected
$800-million deficit by 2005, and county officials say they need to
move now or face worse shortfalls in the future.</LD>
<TE>   In interviews Tuesday, supervisors were cool to the requests for
delay. "The feds expected us to do this five years ago," Supervisor
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said. "Where we made our mistake is letting
people like Mr. Riordan make us delay so we have no credibility in
Washington."</TE>
<TE>   The last time the county was in such dire financial straits was
the mid-1990s, when a $1-billion bailout from the Clinton
administration staved off hospital closures. The money, in the form
of a waiver of Medicaid rules, came with strings attached: The county
had five years to make its system more efficient before the money
expired.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors did not make all the reforms they had promised, and in
2000 asked the administration for an extension. They got another five
years, but the amount of money dwindles each year until running out
in 2005. Declining federal money means that deficits will begin in
the next fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Although the supervisors have enough cash on hand to close that
gap for now, they have argued that using spare cash to keep the
health system going without future funding would create more severe
problems. "Just to sit on our hands and say, 'The money's coming, the
money's coming,' is foolish," Supervisor Don Knabe said.</TE>
<TE>   But the officials who spoke Tuesday, calling themselves the
Coalition for Healthy Communities, said it is dangerous to cut health
services.</TE>
<TE>   Cuts should only be made, said Dr. Brian Johnston of the Los
Angeles Medical Assn., "when it's demonstrated it can be done safely,
without putting people at risk."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan pointed out that the county system not only cares for the
uninsured, but also provides emergency services to all classes.
"Whether you're rich or poor, if you're in an automobile accident, or
the bus you're on is hit, if you're brought to an ER, the chances are
50-50 you're going to be brought to a county ER," Riordan said. His
successor, Mayor James K. Hahn, released a statement also urging the
supervisors to delay cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Smiler is a nurse at the busiest of those emergency rooms,
at County-USC Medical Center in Boyle Heights, where patients in
gurneys line the hallways, waiting for a free hospital bed.
Supervisors will consider reducing that hospital's size from about
700 beds to 600 by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know what it's like to tell a mother you can't medicate
her child because you're too busy trying to intubate a gunshot wound
victim," Smiler said. "I just want to urge the board, please don't
move so fast that things will spiral out of control."</TE>
<TE>   Speakers did not identify new sources of money the county could
find to pay for the system. Riordan said the county should sit down
with state and federal officials and hammer out a solution.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors, who meet annually with health officials in Sacramento
and Washington, scoffed at that. Burke said she had spoken with
President Bush when he came to Los Angeles in April but that she does
not see an easy answer.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a choice. We can do this and try to start to cut down on
our system of delivery," Burke said. "If we don't, we run out of
money and we have nowhere to go."</TE>

<HD>Harbor Boating Facility on Hold</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Supervisors order an environmental report of how
the project at Channel Islands may affect a heron colony. Less
intrusive sites are available, opponents say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors on Tuesday delayed plans for a $6-million
boating facility at Channel Islands Harbor, citing inadequate study
of a heron colony that nests in trees on the proposed site.</LD>
<LD>   The supervisors ordered an environmental impact report on the
project--a step that cheered residents bent on protecting wildlife,
and their harbor views.</LD>
<LD>   "This is what we've wanted all along," said Trevor Smith, whose
home is in nearby Hollywood Beach. "An EIR will identify alternate
sites, and the county can pick the site that is least environmentally
damaging."</LD>
<TE>   The 20,000-square-foot building is planned for a strip of parkland
near the Whale's Tail restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Students from Cal State Channel Islands and local secondary
schools would use it for classes in sailing, kayaking and rowing, as
well as marine studies.</TE>
<TE>   But neighbors have fought the county Harbor Department's plan,
contending that half a dozen less intrusive spots are available
around the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   County officials received more than 100 letters of protest from
residents claiming the Harbor Department had done a shoddy analysis
of the project.</TE>
<TE>   The Channel Islands Beach Community Services District, the
equivalent of a town board in the unincorporated area, demanded an
environmental impact report instead of the less exhaustive "mitigated
negative declaration" that had been prepared.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, harbor Director Lyn Krieger reversed her position and
agreed, canceling a July 2 hearing on the proposal and asking the
supervisors to authorize an EIR. She said it would take six months to
complete.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Krieger contended that the herons would nest in other
trees, staying at the harbor for its ample food supply.</TE>
<TE>   But that contention was questioned by the California Coastal
Commission. The county offered no scientific evidence to support its
claim that the displaced birds would thrive elsewhere, the commission
said in a letter to Ventura County planners.</TE>
<TE>   Evergreen trees on the site are home to families of great blue
herons, black-crowned night herons and snowy egrets. While other
rookeries may exist in the area, they do not reduce the importance of
the one that would be jeopardized by construction, wrote Morgan
Wehtje, a senior environmental scientist with the state Department of
Fish and Game.</TE>

<HD>Mother-Son Duo Faces Day in L.A. Court</HD>
<DH>Law: The pair who killed a New York socialite will be tried
in the 1998 slaying of a local man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The unmade bed caught Linda Kazdin by surprise. Her father, David,
had been trying to sell his house and was keeping it tidy for
potential buyers. Then she noticed the blinking light on the
answering machine, with more than 10 unheard messages.</LD>
<LD>   When she learned a short time later that her father had been
killed, she didn't hesitate to tell detectives where they should
begin their investigation: Sante and Kenneth Kimes.</LD>
<LD>   The Kimeses were captured in New York four months later, on the
same day an elderly widow disappeared from her home. They became the
most notorious mother and son duo in the nation when they were
convicted of killing socialite Irene Silverman in a plot to swindle
her out of a multimillion-dollar mansion. Now, two years later, the
Kimeses are facing trial in Los Angeles in connection with the Kazdin
slaying, in a case that prosecutors say involves an intricate scheme
of forgery, arson and fraudulent loans.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Grand Jury indicted the Kimeses last month
on charges of murdering Kazdin, 63, who ran a photocopying business
out of his home. Both Kenneth Kimes, 27, and Sante Kimes, 67, have
pleaded not guilty and are scheduled to return to court today for a
pretrial hearing. If convicted, they could face the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Recently unveiled grand jury transcripts describe in detail the
March 13, 1998, slaying and the Kimeses' alleged motive. Much of that
detail comes from a witness who told grand jurors that he and Kenneth
Kimes had wrapped the body in plastic bags, put it in the trunk of
Kazdin's Jaguar and discarded it in a trash bin.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say the Kimeses killed Kazdin because he discovered
that they had taken out a $280,000 loan in his name and he had
reported the fraud to bank officials. They allege that Kenneth Kimes
pulled the trigger, while his mother orchestrated the murder.</TE>
<TE>   According to the transcripts, Kenneth drove to Kazdin's house in
Granada Hills with Shawn Little, who had been hired by the Kimeses to
work on their cars. Little testified that he waited outside while
Kenneth entered the house. Then Little said he heard a popping sound,
"like a gun going off." Kimes waved him inside, where Little said he
saw a man lying on the floor and gasping for air. Kimes was holding a
small automatic gun and said he had shot the man, the transcripts
say.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me to help him with this body, to help him clean up and
help him put this body in bags," Little said.</TE>
<TE>   Little, who has received immunity for his testimony, said Kimes
wiped down the counters and ordered Little to look for checkbooks and
bank statements. Little said he then left in the Jaguar and Kimes
drove away in a Lincoln Continental. They bought new pants and
watched part of a movie before dropping Kazdin's body in a trash bin
and the dismantled gun in a storm drain, Little said. Finally, he
said, they abandoned the Jaguar, stopped to buy a $100 bouquet of
flowers for Sante Kimes and returned to the Bel-Air house where they
were staying.</TE>
<TE>   Body in Trash Bin</TE>
<TE>   Kazdin's body was discovered the next day in a trash bin near Los
Angeles International Airport. He had been shot once in the back of
the head with a 22-caliber bullet.   Sante Kimes, who has two sons,
has a criminal history dating back to the 1960s that includes
convictions for petty larceny, credit card fraud and stealing a mink
coat from a piano bar. She was also convicted in 1986 on slaveholding
charges after treating her maids like indentured servants. Her
then-husband, Kenneth Kimes Sr., who built luxury hotels, pleaded
guilty to a lesser charge</TE>
<TE>   After her husband's death in 1994, Sante Kimes' crimes took a more
violent turn, authorities say. "They've been deemed these grifters or
drifters," LAPD Det. Dennis English said of Sante and Kenneth Jr.
"But a true grifter is in it for the con, not for the kill. What
makes somebody jump from just fraud to murder I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Sante Kimes is also suspected of being involved in the
disappearance of a bank official in the Cayman Islands and of a man
who told federal agents that he had burned one of the Kimeses' houses
for them.</TE>
<TE>   Greedy and Vicious</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne King, who wrote a book about the pair, said Sante is a
greedy, vicious woman who manipulated others into helping with her
deceitful schemes. "She has this knack of getting people to do things
for her that they wouldn't normally do," said King, author of "Dead
End."</TE>
<TE>   Sante's older son, Kent Walker, said that at his mother's request,
he had begun shoplifting and breaking into houses by the time he was
10 years old. After years of fighting, he finally escaped her grasp
and his younger brother then assumed the role of his mother's
accomplice, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They became two peas in a pod," said Walker, who wrote a book
about his life, "Son of a Grifter." "Beating the system was no
problem. Mom was a magician at that. He fell right into it."</TE>
<TE>   The young Kenneth Kimes attended UC Santa Barbara, but dropped out
in 1996 and was arrested on suspicion of robbery and assault in
Florida the next year. His attorney, Deputy Public Defender Regina
Laughney, said she hopes that jurors will be able to separate her
client's case from that of his mother, who is representing herself.</TE>
<TE>   David Kazdin met and became friendly with Kenneth Kimes Sr. in the
1970s. Years later, Kazdin agreed to let the Kimeses put his name on
the deed for their Las Vegas house. Then in 1997, Sante Kimes took
out a $280,000 loan on that house without Kazdin's permission. She
directed a notary, Nanette Wetkowski, to forge Kazdin's name to the
application, according to the grand jury testimony.</TE>
<TE>   The loan was granted, and Sante Kimes had most of the money wired
to Wetkowski's Las Vegas bank account and eventually to the Cayman
Islands, prosecutors said. She directed the bank not to send any loan
paperwork to Kazdin's Los Angeles address, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The plans stalled when Kazdin accidentally received a payment book
in January 1998, telling him that he owed money on his loan. He
called the bank, saying that the loan was fraudulent and that he had
not signed any application, according to grand jury testimony. The
bank froze Wetkowski's account and began an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Sante Kimes transferred the house into the name of
Robert McCarren, a homeless man who was living with the pair and
doing some cleaning and cooking. Sante and Kenneth had McCarren apply
for a $500,000 homeowner insurance policy, prosecutors said, then
tried another scam. They moved furniture and valuables out of the Las
Vegas house just days before it was gutted by fire, according to the
grand jury testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Sante Kimes ordered McCarren to try to claim the insurance money
for them, prosecutors said. But the firm wouldn't release the money
because the fire appeared to have been intentionally set and the bank
was investigating the loan.</TE>
<TE>   "It became known to Sante Kimes and Kenneth Kimes that David
Kazdin was standing in their way for half a million dollars," Deputy
Dist. Atty. Eleanor Hunter told the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate Letters</TE>
<TE>   Sante Kimes started sending desperate letters, signed by McCarren,
urging the bank to stop the investigation, prosecutors said, and
directed Wetkowski to call Kazdin, who became nervous and a little
frightened. The Kimeses traveled from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in
February 1998, sending Wetkowski to Kazdin's door one day to persuade
him to tell the bank that he had authorized the loan, prosecutors
said.</TE>
<TE>   Phillip Eaton, Kazdin's attorney and a close friend, said in an
interview that Kazdin had asked for his help in dealing with the
Kimeses and the loan. "He was annoyed and just didn't want anything
to do with her," Eaton said. In one phone call, Kazdin said of Sante
Kimes, "This woman is crazy. She will do anything," according to
Eaton.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Kazdin told the grand jury about the Kimeses' attempts to
reach her father and reported a frightening comment he had made to
her just days before his death: "Don't worry. Nothing will happen
while you're here."</TE>
<TE>   After Kazdin's death, the Kimeses left Los Angeles. LAPD
detectives followed, trying to track them down as they traveled to
Nevada, Florida and Louisiana. Detectives nearly caught them in Baton
Rouge, where they allegedly used a false name to buy a motor home.
But by the time the police arrived, the Kimeses had departed.</TE>
<TE>   "We always seemed to be a day or two, if not a week, behind them,"
English said. "It became very frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of July 1998, Los Angeles police detectives
learned that the Kimeses were in New York. The mother and son had
reportedly called a Las Vegas friend, Stan Patterson, and asked him
to travel to New York to manage an apartment building for them.
Patterson informed police, who were waiting when the meeting took
place at the New York Hilton on July 5--six hours later than planned.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested the Kimeses on a Utah warrant charging them with
writing a bad check to buy a luxury car and soon began investigating
their connection with Silverman, an 82-year-old widow and their
landlady. The Kimeses had Silverman's keys, passport and checks at
the time of their arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Guilty of Murder</TE>
<TE>   After a sensational three-month trial, a New York jury found the
Kimeses guilty in May 2000 of murdering Silverman, even though her
body was never found. Mother and son were also convicted of robbery,
burglary, conspiracy and forgery, and each was sentenced to more than
120 years in prison. They were extradited to Los Angeles last year.</TE>
<TE>   Mel A. Sachs, who represented Sante Kimes in New York, said both
the conviction and the publicity could have a "devastating impact" on
the Los Angeles case.</TE>
<TE>   In the coming trial, prosecutors are expected to present numerous
witnesses and show jurors lists, letters and notes written by the
Kimeses that the prosecution says point to their guilt. Sante Kimes
wrote in one letter to Wetkowski after the Los Angeles murder, "It's
urgent not to talk, period" and "You did nothing wrong. David Kazdin
always authorized it."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say another entry in one of the notebooks seized from
the Kimeses' car in New York read: "Kill D.K."</TE>

<HD>Koreatown, Take a Bow</HD>
<DH>Sports: Their beloved South Korean soccer team loses in
World Cup play, but proud and considerate fans still come away
winners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Haejin Lee cupped her face in her hands early Tuesday morning,
watching through her fingers as South Korea's final shot missed the
net. Around her, bodies sagged. Lee's face dropped one last time into
her lap, which was covered by the flag she and so many others had
come to embrace in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Then Lee lifted her head, disappointed that South Korea had lost
to Germany 1-0 in the 2002 World Cup semifinal, but not distraught.
All around her were signs of what the national team's improbable rise
in the tournament had meant to Los Angeles' Koreatown district.</LD>
<LD>   It was not just that local merchants made money from the thousands
who missed sleep to gather at 6th Street and Alexandria Avenue for
the team's last two games. It was that many area residents felt they
had won back a sense of pride tarnished 10 years ago in the Los
Angeles riots, when racial discord triggered attacks on hundreds of
Korean-owned businesses.</LD>
<TE>   For some, South Korea's surprising string of successes in World
Cup soccer had even deeper historical significance: A country
oppressed on many levels was now winning worldwide respect for
beating Portugal, Italy and Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The mostly young Korean American spectators, watching the first
Asian team to make it to the World Cup semifinals, positioned
themselves on the pavement of Equitable Plaza, trying to get the best
view of the two 160-inch television screens set up to show the game.
Most, like Haejin Lee, a 23-year-old office receptionist who
emigrated from Seoul as a child and had never seen a soccer game
before this tournament, had not gone to sleep before the 4:30 a.m.
start.</TE>
<TE>   They saturated the landscape with red--the South Korean team is
known as the Red Devils--dressing in specially made shirts printed
with the slogan "Be the Reds." By Monday afternoon this seemed the
uniform of choice in Koreatown. By game time, fans had customized
their shirts--women cutting them to expose their midriffs, men
lopping off the sleeves to make muscle shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Spectators brought drums and other noisemakers: air horns,
cymbals, even a cow bell. Cars cruised down 6th, South Korean flags
flapping from their windows, horns blaring. As drumbeats set the
cadence, the crowd began chanting, "Daehan Minguk!" (Great Korean
nation).</TE>
<TE>   "With this moment," said Hong Kim, a Koreatown restaurant owner
from Buena Park who was working with a volunteer group assisting
police, "we're going to forget the 1992 riots."</TE>
<TE>   Koreatown's evolution to a majority-Latino community was reflected
by Nelson Paz, a Honduran construction worker who wrapped himself in
his own national flag and came to watch the game to "give support to
our friends the Koreans."</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, Jimmy Choi, a 66-year-old Korean American dentist,
watched the match at home on Korean-language television, celebrating
it as another example of the arduous road his people have traveled to
gain international recognition.</TE>
<TE>   For centuries, the Korean peninsula was hounded by its powerful
neighbors--Japan, China and Russia--because of its strategic
location. In the 20th century, Koreans lived under Japanese rule for
35 years until 1945. Soon after Korea was freed from Japan, the
peninsula was divided by the United States and the Soviet Union, once
again becoming a geopolitical pawn.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of Koreans died during the Korean War, which broke out 52
years ago Tuesday. South Koreans then endured three decades of
authoritarian rule, during which even Korean Americans living in
California were careful not to speak ill of the repressive government
for fear of retaliation against loved ones back home.</TE>
<TE>   Today, more than a decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the divided Korean peninsula remains a place where differing
ideologies keep millions of relatives separated without even
communication by mail.</TE>
<TE>   "That our players can walk shoulder to shoulder with the most
skillful soccer players in the world is so inspiring," said Choi,
who, while not a big soccer fan, watched each World Cup game. "Though
I am a U.S. citizen, my heart is very Korean. How can I help it?"</TE>
<TE>   He and many others were convinced that the soccer team's rise had
infused Koreans worldwide with confidence. Others wondered whether
too much patriotism would create a backlash.</TE>
<TE>   As happy as he was with the team's play, Warren Chun, owner of an
auto-repair business in Koreatown, wished that Korean Americans would
tone down the soccer fever, lest they give the rest of America a
negative impression. Chun might have been comforted by what happened
in Equitable Plaza after South Korea missed that last shot and the
clock ran out.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately, the spectators stood, many stooping to grab
the red trash bags that had been left around the parking lot. They
gathered up the papers, wrappers, plastic bottles and foam coffee
cups that had been strewn about.</TE>
<TE>   Then this river of red shirts flowed out onto 6th, leaving an
empty, pristine plaza, the trash bags piled neatly by the exits.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer K. Connie Kang contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>School Board Votes to Probe Joint Venture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles school board Tuesday ordered the district's auditor
to investigate the selection of a controversial joint venture for
three construction management contracts worth $33 million.</LD>
<LD>   The board's 6-0 vote for an audit came a day after a Times report
that 3DInternational Inc. and URS Corp. was dismissed from a school
modernization job in Baltimore after complaints of lax supervision.</LD>
<LD>   Facilities officials at Los Angeles Unified said they were unaware
of the partnership's problems in Maryland because they surfaced last
month after the firms became finalists in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   3D/International was one of 21 firms recommended to share $230
million in contracts for management of school construction.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer said  the district didn't err in its selection.
Despite the problems, he said, officials have identified qualified
individuals within the companies.</TE>
<TE>   "If we hear that the team in Maryland screwed up, it doesn't mean
we shouldn't deal with them," he said. "That doesn't mean the whole
company is corrupted."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the district auditor reported that 3D/I and O'Brien
Kreitzberg--a predecessor of URS Corp.--had overbilled L.A. Unified.</TE>

<LD>Eventually, we'll be able to handle the terrorists, Wall Street will
finally settle down, and we may even get through the steroid scandal
in major league baseball.</LD>
<LD>   But if Martha Stewart goes down for insider trading, the republic
is off the track and headed for the cliff. And as you read this,
congressional investigators are circling her like buzzards, and
Stewart offered only a half-hearted defense Tuesday while chopping
cabbage on CBS' "The Early Show."</LD>
<LD>   What is this country's greatest asset? Purchasing power, that's
what. The first thing President Bush told us to do after Sept. 11 was
to go shopping. It was our duty as Americans to restore patriotic
confidence and zeal by spending ourselves out of the doldrums.</LD>
<TE>   Why? Because that's our first line of defense. We're the most
insatiable consumers in the history of the civilized world, and
Martha Stewart, with her multimillion-dollar cross-merchandising
Omnimedia empire, is our diva.</TE>
<TE>   She is the one who taught us that neither religion nor Prozac is
the true path to happiness. The far greater opiate is to buy things
we don't need with money we don't have.</TE>
<TE>   When you can visit marthastewart.com any time of day or night and
purchase Venetian lace hemstitch linens, you feel invincible. How can
third-world terrorists sleeping in caves be taken seriously?</TE>
<TE>   Unless they've visited Stewart's Web site recently, those mongrels
don't know that delicious salads made with vitamin-rich leafy greens
are a staple of healthy summer eating (MasterCard accepted for all
utensils).</TE>
<TE>   They don't know that sorbet, cherries, edible-flower confetti and
berries add delicious detail to serving plates (the Wedgwood white
bone china is $60 per place setting).</TE>
<TE>   The terrorists might actually be using tiki torches during outdoor
entertaining, but they are most likely unaware that party songs
"should be easygoing, carefree, and fun." (Martha's Summer
Entertaining CD, for just $11.98, features "Groovin' '' by the Young
Rascals and "Do You Know the Way to San Jose" by Dionne Warwick.)</TE>
<TE>   We'd be adrift without her.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Stewart bring graceful home decorating possibilities
to millions of Kmart shoppers, but as a product of modest Polish
immigrant parents, she represented the dream. With the right
marketing and the luck of timing, you could become a billionaire in
this country on the strength of one good bundt cake recipe.</TE>
<TE>   Tell us it ain't so, Martha.</TE>
<TE>   America needs to believe you didn't get a heads up when you dumped
$227,000 worth of ImClone Systems stock the day before the FDA
rejected ImClone's application for a cancer drug.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone's former chief executive, a pal of yours, was collared by
FBI agents and charged with securities fraud and conspiracy. Then
your broker got dumped amid swirling controversy and conflicting
statements over a call he placed to you the day you bailed out.</TE>
<TE>   We can live with the knowledge that corporate America is ruled by
a band of shameless chief executives who'd steal from their own
grandmothers. Enron, Global Crossing, Rite Aid, Tyco, Arthur Andersen
and a dozen others are prime examples of capitalism run amok.</TE>
<TE>   But we can't accept the possibility that the doyenne who rescued
us from our least flattering sense of ourselves--someone who speaks
to us in a hopeful, reassuring manner about proper stemware and a
taco dinner that's as much fun to prepare as it is to eat--might
actually be an imperial, corner-cutting shrew.</TE>
<TE>   In her hallmark appearance on "The Early Show," Stewart assured
the masses she would be "exonerated of any ridiculousness." She was
chopping cabbage at the time because summer is best for salads, and
there appeared to be no shredded documents in the recipe.</TE>
<TE>   But this is no time for Martha's trademark composure. Stewart, who
often looks as though she's just donated plasma, needs to shake a
fist in her own defense, or at least part her lips while speaking.
Nothing less than the fate of the republic is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   I'm looking for something along the lines of Nixon's televised
"Checkers" speech, in which he denied financial improprieties and
defiantly refused to give back a cocker spaniel that had been a gift
to his children.</TE>
<TE>   Or Stewart ought to just look us in the eye and say of course she
bent a few rules and grabbed what she could, but it wasn't nearly as
much as those plundering male CEOs who never get locked up. Doesn't
everyone want something they don't have, anyway, like an extra
hundred million dollars, or maybe Venetian lace hemstitch linens?</TE>
<TE>   Now that her porcelain image is cracked, Stewart's own stock is
tumbling and, for national security interests, we can't let that
happen. The enemy already thinks he's got us on the run, living in
fear of the next hit and losing confidence in capitalism.</TE>

<HD>Mahony on Web Site's List of 'Worst Bishops'</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Beliefnet.com, a popular religion outlet, places
L.A. archbishop among nine leaders who it says handled sexual abuse
cases poorly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, archbishop of the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, was named Tuesday by a leading religion
Web site as one of the nation's nine "worst bishops" in handling
clergy sexual abuse cases.</LD>
<LD>   Beliefnet.com said that despite Mahony's recent efforts to take a
tough stand on reform, he had failed to promptly dismiss at least
three priests who reportedly admitted to sexual abuse of minors. The
Web site said plaintiffs have charged Mahony with "concealing
information" from law enforcement officials on abuse allegations and
it criticized the archdiocese's approach to victims as "potential
litigants rather than wounded souls." Those developments and claims
have been chronicled by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   The respected site, which reaches nearly 5 million people a month,
features news, features and commentary on a broad range of religious
traditions. Columnists range from Richard Land of the Southern
Baptist Convention to Catholic sociologist Andrew Greeley to
Starhawk, a leader in goddess spirituality.</LD>
<TE>   The site's posting on Mahony--based largely on its editors'
interpretation of news media reports rather than independent
research--comes two weeks after the nation's Roman Catholic bishops
passed a tough "zero-tolerance" policy that calls for permanently
ousting from public ministry all priests and deacons who sexually
abuse minors. The leaders failed, however, to take substantive action
to hold the American church's nearly 300 bishops accountable for
failing to properly discipline predatory priests--an omission that
has triggered discontent among many Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokesman Tod Tamberg criticized the Web site for
failing to contact the Los Angeles Archdiocese to verify the
information on Mahony before posting the list. He said he was first
contacted by Beliefnet at 2:45 p.m. Tuesday, nearly three hours after
it had sent out a news release naming the nine bishops. Tamberg
declined to say whether the report on Mahony was inaccurate, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Beliefnet has done a great disservice to readers who look to it
for reliable information, and to those in the church who are working
diligently and compassionately to reach out to victims and to ensure
that all of the ministries of the Catholic Church are safe,
especially for our children and young people," Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the cardinal had established a tough
"zero-tolerance" policy against abusive priests, formed an
independent clergy misconduct oversight board to review all
allegations of sex abuse and was expanding "child-safe programs in
all of our 287 schools and parishes."</TE>
<TE>   Beliefnet Editor in Chief Steven Waldman said the list was
compiled in an attempt to "put the spotlight on bishops who failed to
solve the problem." He said he was "struck over the head" by the
anger many bishops voiced during their recent national conference in
Dallas against the minority of bishops who had mishandled cases,
creating a crisis for the entire church.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been hearing from all quarters about not just how horrible
the crime of child abuse is, but how people are upset with the
actions and inactions of the bishops," Waldman said.</TE>
<TE>   Waldman said the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops did not
return a call to comment on the list in advance of its posting this
week. He added that he would promptly post any comments from bishops
or other church authorities on the list.</TE>
<TE>   In a poll posted Monday night by Beliefnet and ABC News, eight in
10 Americans--and seven in 10 Catholics--favored criminal charges
against bishops who failed to act on abuse allegations. The poll,
which surveyed 1,023 Americans, including 251 Catholics, also found
dissatisfaction with the bishops' performance in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Although 77% of Catholics believed the Dallas meeting would
produce "meaningful improvements," only 44% said such progress had
actually materialized. Only two in 10 of those surveyed--Catholics
and non-Catholics alike--supported the bishops' policy to allow some
offenders to stay in the priesthood, even with the harsh restrictions
of stripping them of their Roman collar or right to celebrate Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Mahony, the Web site named as "worst bishops": Cardinal
Bernard Law of Boston, Bishop Charles Grahmann of Dallas, Bishop
Thomas J. O'Brien of Phoenix, Bishop John B. McCormack of New
Hampshire, Archbishop Manuel Moreno of Tucson, Bishop Gerald
Gettelfinger of Evansville, Ind., Bishop William Murphy of Rockville
Centre, N.Y., and Bishop Elden Curtiss of Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Beliefnet also cited three bishops for "exemplifying a positive
approach to the crisis." They were Bishop Donald Wuerl of Pittsburgh,
who appealed to Rome when the Vatican refused to accept his request
to defrock an abusive priest; Bishop John Kinney of St. Cloud, Minn.;
and Bishop Wilton Gregory of Belleville, Ill., president of the
bishops conference, who led the efforts in Dallas to adopt the tough
reform policy.</TE>

<HD>Too Many Old Mines, Too Little Money</HD>
<DH>Safety: Brothers' deaths underscore officials' inability to
seal more than a few of the state's 46,000 abandoned shafts and
quarries annually.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal and state officials have known for years that the abandoned
Blue Light Mine in the Santa Ana Mountains was a potential deathtrap
for curious explorers, but say they lacked the money and manpower to
seal it.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana brothers Nicholas, 23, and Glenn Anderson, 18, died in
the flooded former silver mine Sunday, bringing to 13 the number of
people who have been killed nationwide this year in old mines and
quarries. Since the beginning of 1999, at least 55 people have died,
most of them by drowning.</LD>
<LD>   As they juggled grief and anger Tuesday, the Andersons' friends
and relatives began organizing a petition drive demanding that
authorities seal the Blue Light Mine, and contemplated a
vigilante-style visit to the area to do the job themselves.</LD>
<TE>   "We need to do something as a community to make sure this doesn't
happen again," said Julie Flanders, mother of Matthew Murphy, 17, who
was hiking with the Andersons. "We put railroad guards over
crossings; we should be putting bars over mine openings."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the deaths have led them to scour budgets to find
money to seal the tunnel in which the brothers died, one of the
mine's eight openings that are accessible to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a tragedy like this, it reminds you of potential
hazards that may not have been on the front burner," said Kathy
Bacon, deputy public affairs officer for the Cleveland National
Forest, which manages the 269-acre Blue Light Mine parcel. "The
Forest Service will try to determine what sort of grating or
obstructions could or should be done."</TE>
<TE>   Bacon said short-term measures have already been taken. Federal
officials will be posted near the mine through the long Fourth of
July weekend to warn daytime visitors of the dangers. The mine lies
about two miles off Silverado Canyon Road, beyond a locked gate that
prevents vehicles from entering the area.</TE>
<TE>   "It'd be wonderful if we could make the Cleveland National Forest
safe from all potential hazards, but we've got 427,000 acres to
manage," Bacon said. "We've got potentially dangerous roads, insects,
animals, snakes and abandoned mines."</TE>
<TE>   Forest officials will also reevaluate the type and number of
warning signs that should be posted near the unmarked mine, she said,
though signs often are vandalized or stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Autopsies conducted Tuesday were inconclusive. The Orange County
coroner's office said it will issue its rulings after toxicology
tests--which could take more than a month--are completed. Officials
said they believe the brothers suffocated in the foul air or drowned.</TE>
<TE>   The Anderson brothers and Murphy entered a mine pool Sunday
afternoon. Murphy, a certified diver, decided the opaque water was
too dangerous to navigate and declined to follow the brothers any
deeper into the cave.</TE>
<TE>   "They got into about chest-deep water, and one of the boys felt an
opening under the surface with his hands that led into the next
cavern, and they just went in," Flanders said.</TE>
<TE>   "But Matt just couldn't, wouldn't go any farther. So he left his
flashlight pointed toward the opening so the boys could see it from
the other side. But none of them knew the air was full of carbon
dioxide and methane gas."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy spent much of Tuesday with friends, his body still bearing
amber stains from the murky mine pool, Flanders said.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids want to grab as many boards and nails and hammers they
can to close these mines off themselves," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 46,000 abandoned mines and quarries in
California or about one every 3.4 square miles, according to state
officials. Only a few are sealed each year under policies that focus
on mines posing environmental risks, such as leaching poisons into
watersheds.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the more than 200 abandoned mines identified in the
Cleveland National Forest remain accessible; last year officials
plugged one mine that posed too much of a risk near Trabuco Canyon
Road.</TE>
<TE>   There are four general approaches to sealing mines: installing
gates, filling vertical shafts with a hardening foam, backfilling
with dirt and rock, and using dynamite to collapse tunnels. Costs
vary by method, and some--such as dynamiting--carry heavy
environmental risks, including endangering bats.</TE>
<TE>   A year after a 1997 Forest Service study rated the Blue Light Mine
as a high physical hazard, federal officials closed three of its most
accessible openings with $7,000 gates, plus the costs of installation
and delivery by helicopter. One expert said it would cost about
$20,000 to fill the Blue Light Mine with foam. Estimates for
dynamiting and backfilling were not available.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday was the first time the Anderson brothers had visited the
Blue Light Mine.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave warnings to both [Matt and Glenn] before they left the
house," Flanders, Murphy's mother, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'If you go hiking up to Silverado, watch for
rattlesnakes, and whatever you do, don't go in the mines, and don't
go in the caves.'</TE>
<TE>   "They just happened to take a different trail and happened upon
[it]," she said. "But if there had been something warning them, a
sign that said danger, methane gas or carbon dioxide, they never
would have gone in there."</TE>

<TE>   Flanders said she took her son to a doctor Tuesday after he
developed respiratory problems, the likely result of conditions in
the mine. He is also having trouble coming to terms with his friends'
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to watch a 17-year-old boy going through
something this horrific," Flanders said. "I keep telling him, 'You
did everything right.' If my son had gone into that water, no one
would know where those boys were. He became their cry for help."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy spent much of Tuesday with friends, his body still bearing
amber stains from the murky mine pool, Flanders said.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids want to grab as many boards and nails and hammers they

<TE>   There are more than 46,000 abandoned mines and quarries in
California or about one every 3.4 square miles, according to state
officials. Only a few are sealed each year under policies that focus
on mines posing environmental risks, such as leaching poisons into
watersheds.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the more than 200 abandoned mines identified in the
Cleveland National Forest remain accessible; last year officials
plugged one mine that posed too much of a risk near Trabuco Canyon
Road.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, abandoned mines honeycomb the ground from Michigan's
iron-rich Upper Peninsula to coal seams in Pennsylvania. At a flooded
quarry in Box Canyon, near La Costa in San Diego County, at least
five people have drowned over the years, the most recent a
16-year-old boy who sneaked into the fenced-off wildlife habitat. In
Kern County last month, a 12-year-old riding a dirt bike fell 150
feet down a mine shaft that collapsed beneath him. He suffered minor
injuries in the fall, which ended when he landed on a board bisecting
the shaft.</TE>
<TE>   There are four general approaches to sealing mines: installing
gates, filling vertical shafts with a hardening foam, backfilling
with dirt and rock, and using dynamite to collapse tunnels. Costs
vary by method, and some--such as dynamiting--carry heavy
environmental risks, including endangering bats.</TE>

most accessible openings with $7,000 gates, plus the costs of
installation and delivery by helicopter. One expert said it would
cost about $20,000 to fill the Blue Light Mine with foam. Estimates
for dynamiting and backfilling were not available.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Rajkovich, whose Aurora, Minn., company has been sealing
mine-shaft openings since 1994 with a rigid polyurethane foam, said
bureaucratic processes add to the financial costs: "The state spends
all the money they are allocated to find the holes rather than
filling them. When they find a hole, they should just close them. The
paperwork costs more than the actual closing."</TE>
<TE>   Under state Department of Conservation procedures, abandoned mines
are assessed for physical and chemical hazards and to determine
whether and how they should be sealed. A lead agency must be named to
coordinate the project, including securing permits and preparing
reports under the California Environmental Quality Act.</TE>
<TE>   "Ideally we would remediate every mine in the state," said Doug
Craig, senior environmental planner for the Department of
Conservation. "But we can't close them without going through the
thought process."</TE>
<TE>   The department has $125,000 set aside to seal mines this year,
though other funds are available for other agencies that could become
involved if a mine poses an environmental concern.</TE>
<TE>   Exploring mines in the Cleveland National Forest has been a rite
of passage for many youths. With few signs of the dangers, many
explorers are unaware of the potentially toxic gases, sudden
collapses or unexpected vertical shafts.</TE>
<TE>   The youths had explored the mine openings before, but never
ventured very far. Sunday was the first time the Anderson brothers
had visited the Blue Light Mine.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave warnings to both [Matt and Glenn] before they left the
house," Flanders, Murphy's mother, said Tuesday. "I said, 'If you go

<LD>A Los Angeles police officer was ordered Tuesday to stand trial on
charges that he raped three women while on duty earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge H. Chester Horn Jr. ruled that there was
enough evidence for Joseph Evan Robinson to be tried on 14 counts,
including two counts of kidnapping to commit a crime and three counts
of rape by threatening arrest.</LD>
<LD>   Robinson, 26, is being held in County Jail in lieu of $3-million
bail. He is scheduled to return to court July 9 for arraignment.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Robinson, a three-year LAPD officer
assigned to the 77th Street Division, sexually assaulted three women
between January and May.</TE>
<TE>   According to testimony in a preliminary hearing Tuesday, the women
feared being arrested or thrown in jail if they did not have sex with
him. Speaking of one of the alleged victims, LAPD Sgt. Mike Zych told
the court, "She indicated that she was afraid, that she didn't want
to go to jail.... She was intimidated by the officer."</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD began investigating the case in January after the first
victim alleged she had been assaulted. Robinson was charged in May,
prosecutors said.</TE>

<HD>Tinseltown Comes Up With Its Own Trashy Ideas for Dressing
a Movie Set</HD>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Journalist Henk Friezer of Eagle Rock, who hands out food to the
needy in downtown L.A. each week, was shocked to see the condition of
one small homeless encampment on Beverly Boulevard. Trash was strewn
everywhere. Friezer couldn't figure it out, because the two fellows
who live there are usually very neat. He found them, and they
explained that a movie company had decided to use their site to shoot
a homeless scene. But the Hollywood types wanted to create their own
"realistic" camp. So the two fellows had to take their belongings
down the street. The movie-makers brought in catered trash.</LD>
<LD>   One of the homeless men, eyeing the mess, told Friezer: "I would
never live that way."</LD>
<LD>   One-two punch: Bob McKewen of San Diego returned from a visit to
northern England with a numbered set of snapshots (see photos).</LD>
<TE>   First, we'll start with the Twice Brewed area. It derived its name
from an inn whose ale was so weak that customers demanded that it be
brewed a second time.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, a youth hostel opened nearby, and one of the sponsors
decreed that "there will be no alcohol served on these premises, so I
hope the tea and coffee will only be brewed once." That facility
became known as the Once Brewed Youth Hostel and is now part of the
Once Brewed Northumberland National Park Visitor Centre.</TE>
<TE>   And, no, I couldn't find a Three-peat area nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Frisbee foundations: The new book "California Firsts" is an
entertaining collection of this state's contributions to the rest of
the world--whether or not the rest of the world was ready for them.
The Pluto Platter (later the Frisbee) went into production at Wham-O
of San Gabriel in 1957. The same company introduced the Hula Hoop the
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Culinary contributions include the Cobb salad (1937, Brown Derby),
the double-deck hamburger (1937, Bob's Big Boy of Glendale) and the
French dip sandwich (Philippe, 1918). And Barbie, who would never go
near a double-deck hamburger, judging from her figure, also was born
here. The year was 1959, though she doesn't like to admit her age.</TE>
<TE>   "California Firsts" (Part II): I must, however, take issue with
author Teri Davis Greenberg about the first drive-in church. She
credits the Rev. Robert Schuller, who on Sunday, March 27, 1955,
"stepped atop the tarpaper roof of the Orange Drive-In's snack bar
and began preaching to curious worshipers who sat in their cars."</TE>
<TE>   Actually that honor belongs to the Rev. Norman L. Hammer of North
Hollywood's Emmanuel Lutheran Church, who first preached to parked
cars on July 10, 1949 (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Hammer's theory was that more people would attend church if they
could show up in casual clothes hidden behind car doors.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pierre Werner, 88, the former Luxembourgian prime minister who
proposed a common European currency that eventually materialized as
the euro, died Monday of natural causes in Luxembourg.</LD>
<LD>   A lawyer, he entered politics with the Christian Social People's
Party, becoming finance minister of the tiny landlocked country in
1953 and then prime minister from 1959 to 1974 and from 1979 to 1984.
He is credited with helping Luxembourg become one of Western Europe's
richest nations by developing it into a banking and financial center
as its traditional steel industry foundered.</LD>
<LD>   The visionary Werner proposed a shared currency for the European
Economic Community in 1970. Although it took three decades for his
plan to reach fruition, he was regarded as the "father of the euro."
His hopes for a common currency had been stalled initially by
economic upheavals surrounding the oil crisis of the early 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   Werner also supported greater European integration on political as
well as economic fronts. After leaving government, he devoted himself
to business as chairman of the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de
Telediffusion and later the Societe Europeenne des Satellites.</TE>

<HD>Elizabeth Douvan, 76; Social Psychologist Studied U.S.

<DL></DL>
<LD>Elizabeth Douvan, 76, a social psychologist who assessed changes in
the American psyche in the mid-20th century, including shifts from
traditional selfless to self-fulfilling roles, died June 15. Douvan,
who taught and did research at the University of Michigan from 1950
until recently, died at her home in Ann Arbor, Mich., after a long
illness.</LD>
<LD>   Born in South Bend, Ind., and educated at Vassar College and the
University of Michigan, Douvan wrote or co-wrote such books as "The
Adolescent Experience" in 1966, "Feminine Personality and Conflict"
in 1970, "The Inner American" and "Mental Health in America," both
published in 1981, and "Marital Instability" in 1995.</LD>
<LD>   Douvan was a study director and program director in various
periods for the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research
and taught for a time at the Fielding Graduate Institute in Santa
Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   Her research beginning in the mid-1950s helped show marked trends
from culturally established roles to the me-first behavior of the
latter half of the century.</TE>
<TE>   Married for 55 years and the mother of two, Douvan considered a
stable marriage important to psychological well-being. As director of
the Family and Sex Role Program within her university institute,
Douvan was intrigued by the development and changing roles of women
and in the early 1970s worked to establish one of the country's first
women's studies programs.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert W. Lenski, 74, a prolific Emmy-nominated television writer who
scripted such television movies as the well-received 1997 "What the
Deaf Man Heard" and last year's "A Death in the Family," died June 19
in Los Angeles of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Born on a Michigan farm, Lenski joined the Marines at age 17 and
caught the end of World War II, including landing on Iwo Jima. After
the war, he earned a degree in English and journalism at the
University of Michigan and worked as a police-beat reporter for the
Jackson (Mich.) Patriot.</LD>
<LD>   When he decided to write for television, Lenski began with popular
series of the 1960s and '70s, penning episodes for "The FBI,"
"Cannon," "Barnaby Jones" and "Manhunter."</LD>
<TE>   But he soon began specializing in miniseries and major television
movies, including the 1975 "Who Is the Black Dahlia?" and the 1976
"Brink's: The Great Robbery."</TE>
<TE>   He wrote several miniseries based on best-selling books, including
"Kane &amp; Abel" in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   He also wrote several programs for the Hallmark Hall of Fame, such
as "Decoration Day" in 1990 and "Breathing Lessons" in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to three Emmy nominations for his work, Lenski
collected a 1979 Edgar Allan Poe Award for his miniseries "The Dain
Curse," a Christopher Award and a Cowboy Hall of Fame Award.</TE>
<TE>   Before launching his television career, Lenski was a vice
president and creative director for the McCann-Erickson Advertising
Agency in Los Angeles.</TE>

<LD>First, this announcement, brought to you by your Constitution: She
has not been accused of a crime. She has not even been sent to her
room without her dinner (although she could probably fashion a meal
out of old tic tacs and cracker crumbs in the bottom of her purse).</LD>
<LD>   Everybody squared away on that? Good.</LD>
<LD>   Martha Stewart--Miss Billion-Dollar Conglomerate, the girl voted
Most Wanted to Be Spotted Coming Out of the Restroom with Toilet
Paper Stuck to Her Shoe--is in trouble.</LD>
<TE>   The CEO, who has done more to make the average woman feel
inadequate than anyone since Hugh Hefner, is getting the twice-over
from congressional investigators.</TE>
<TE>   They're asking those grand old questions that generally get asked
before we start hearing some phrase with -gate stuck on the end of
it: What did she know, and when did she know it? How is it she
happened to sell off several thousand shares of ImClone Systems Inc.
just one day before bad news about the stock in question sent the
share price south faster than mallards in October?</TE>
<TE>   Could Martha's next cookbook really be "Stirring It Up in Stir:
Favorite Recipes of the Graybar Hotel"? Will her magazine, Martha
Stewart Living, be retitled "Martha Stewart Serving," with tips on
how to keep the creases sharp in your prison jumpsuit?</TE>
<TE>   The fact of it is, no. Martha Stewart's just happens to be a more
familiar face than much likelier targets. No one knows enough about
Rite Aid's Martin L. Grass and company ($1.6 billion "restatement of
earnings" that the feds call fraud), Tyco International's L. Dennis
Kozlowski (indicted on charges of dodging state and city sales tax),
ImClone's Samuel Waksal, or even Enron's Kenneth "Po-Mouth" Lay, to
make fun of them.</TE>
<TE>   Added together, the newest generation of accused may have ripped
off the equivalent of the GDP of several small nations, but because
they did it with the point of a pen and not the point of a gun, the
odds are that if they serve any time at all, it may be no more than
they might spend on a leisurely round-the-world cruise. And their
prison, like the QEII, might offer shuffleboard and swimming.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two decades' worth of savings-and-loan shysters, stock fraudsters
and investment scammers have given us men like Charles Keating, who
had the chutzpah to scold Hefner on behalf of the "Citizens for
Decency," and then turn around and peddle his own brand of
obscenity--worthless junk bonds--to trusting old ladies who wound up
eating cat food.</TE>
<TE>   Add them all up and all these men probably served less time in
prison than a single three-striker's life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Pontell at UC Irvine found in 1994 that the S&amp;L
swindlers--if they served time at all--served a couple of months'
less for devastating hundreds or thousands of investors' lives than
your average car thief did for pinching a Toyota.</TE>
<TE>   Is there really any reason to think things might be different this
time around? Could Fortune magazine's cover demanding "Send them to
jail" really turn out to be anything more than show-trial wishful
thinking?</TE>
<TE>   Compared to white-collar crime, nailing the less-than-bright,
two-a-penny petty criminal, the burglar or bank robber, is easy. Easy
to find, easy to convict, easy to add up to a good conviction rate.
Sticking it to the white-collar felon requires sophisticated computer
and financial skills, long, long hours and lots and lots of money. If
your standard petty criminal case were as tough and complicated, it'd
be like prosecuting O.J. Simpson 20 times a week.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine's Gilbert Geis has written a lot about white-collar
crime, and says prosecuting it is hard for three reasons. The first
is proving intent--"That's very difficult. Second, they're more
sophisticated. That's one of the reasons they got so rich--they know
how to cover up. Thirdly, they've got a lot of money so they get very
good attorneys," and the chances of being caught in the first place
are "very slim," and if they are, "the penalty tends to be minimal."</TE>
<TE>   Added to that is the public, confused and bored and possessed,
says Geis, of a certain sneaking envy. "I look at baseball players
and Enron salaries and I may be morally outraged, but I think, 'Hey,
I wouldn't mind having that money either,' and that helps to dim the
outrage."</TE>
<TE>   If anything can make this time different--"spectacularly
different"--it's the "dramatically enormous gulf between haves and
have-nots now.... I think crime is a function of a society's ethos,
and I think ethos is becoming more and more financially corrupt."</TE>
<TE>   And unless it's different, "spectacularly different," any
faint-hearted prosecution, any sentence that sends an 18-year-old
first-time offender to the slammer until he's old enough to run for
president, for knocking over a mini-mart for a hundred bucks and some
beer, could also be, "Next time you steal, do it right. Do it big.
It's the American way."</TE>

<HD>Reseda Principal Made His Mark</HD>
<DH>Retirement: In 15 years, administrator steered school
through good times and bad.</DH>

<LD>Retiring Principal Robert Kladifko has seen hundreds of students come
and go in his 15 years at Reseda High School. But among the handful
who stand out are those he lost too soon.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, junior Tulsi Kumar and four family members were killed
in a house fire that police believe was intentionally set.</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, senior Eric Hoggatt made a dozen or so tackles in a
school football game, went home and climbed into bed. He never woke
up. A head injury had caused a fatal buildup of blood in his skull.</LD>
<TE>   In 1993, senior Michael Ensley was shot and killed as he walked
down a school hallway.</TE>
<TE>   In each case, Kladifko answered questions of the reporters and
parents who descended on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Faculty and students said it also was Kladifko who afterward
shifted the focus away from the deaths and onto more positive aspects
of Reseda High and its innovative academic, sports and
extracurricular programs.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Kladifko, 67, will end his tenure at Reseda High and
cap a 42-year career with Los Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   He will assume an assistant professorship at Cal State Northridge,
where his students will be future teachers and school administrators.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that this principal has done more for this school, its
programs and its public appearance than any other," said Joel
Schaeffer, a 32-year Reseda High faculty member and the coordinator
of the school's police academy program.</TE>
<TE>   During Kladifko's tenure, Reseda High has instituted a number of
programs. Among them are:</TE>
<TE>   * theme-based academies focused on such diverse occupations as
police work, new media and multilingual teaching;</TE>
<TE>   * a student-run unity council to mediate conflicts among peers;</TE>
<TE>   * a student-operated copier business on campus;</TE>
<TE>   * a character-development program for staff and students, to
instill such values as respect, responsibility and fairness,
administered by Kladifko;</TE>
<TE>   * and a Naval Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps.</TE>
<TE>   A Reseda High without Kladifko just seems unfathomable, said
graduating senior Nathaly Tortola, 17, the school's student body
president. "We view him like a grandfather-type figure. Everybody
turns to him when they don't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   Kladifko was recruited by the district in 1960 from a small school
in Mazeppa, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has worked as a teacher and administrator in
schools in the South Bay, East Los Angeles, Watts and the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   And he has been teaching an education class at CSUN.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in almost every corner of my district," Kladifko said,
seated in his office, surrounded by plaques and certificates of
appreciation.</TE>

<HD>Fred Rochlin, 78; Related His War Experiences in Monologues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A close friend once described Fred Rochlin as the guy you would avoid
in line at the post office. Shuffling into a room in sneakers and a
worn cap, he had a raspy, high-pitched voice, reminiscent of Walter
Brennan. If he engaged you in conversation, the first thing out of
his mouth might be: "Do you believe in God?"</LD>
<LD>   Rochlin supported no organized religion, but he was spiritual. He
saw life as a never-ending search for meaning, which he pursued
through World War II as the navigator of a bomber, then by building a
successful architectural firm in Los Angeles and finally the
discovery--in his eighth decade--of an improbable second career as a
spellbinding monologuist.</LD>
<LD>   His show, and a subsequent book, was called "Old Man in a Baseball
Cap: A Memoir of World War II." It was a series of monologues about
his wartime experiences, full of sexual adventures and chilling
confrontations with death, that he performed at theaters around the
country between 1996 and 2001.</LD>
<TE>   "The monologue, about an ordinary man in extraordinary
circumstances, has the elements of an epic: love and death, honor and
betrayal, vengefulness and martyrdom, and ultimately, the
fortuitousness of survival," New York Times cultural critic Bruce
Weber wrote in a glowing article after seeing Rochlin in 1998 at the
B Street Theater in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Rochlin died of leukemia Saturday at St. John's Health Center in
Santa Monica. He was 78.</TE>
<TE>   He was past 70 when he began performing, making him "maybe the
oldest fledgling performance artist in the world," Weber said.</TE>
<TE>   Shedding the cautiousness bred in him as one of the few Jews
growing up in rural Arizona in the 1920s, he shocked family members
and friends with his newfound life on stage.</TE>
<TE>   He was "the artist formerly known as Dad," daughter Margy Rochlin
said in a wryly affectionate portrait for National Public Radio in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest of five children of Russian Jewish immigrants who ran
a hardware store, Rochlin grew up outside Nogales, Ariz., speaking
fluent Spanish, English and a little Yiddish.</TE>
<TE>   He was an outstanding student at Nogales High School, but lost his
way at the University of Arizona and was failing courses when World
War II saved him from abject academic embarrassment. At the age of
19, he signed up for the Army Air Corps and was assigned to
navigation school. He flew 50 combat missions over Europe and was
shot down twice. He saw buddies decapitated by shrapnel and was
sprayed by their blood and guts. One time he was forced to bail out
over Yugoslavia and spent a month walking back to his squadron in
Italy, guided by an amorous partisan named Marushka. By the war's
end, he had been decorated 14 times.</TE>
<TE>   After the war he enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a bachelor's
degree in architecture in 1949. He married Berkeley student Harriet
Shapiro, a Hispanic studies major who later became a novelist and
historian.</TE>
<TE>   He apprenticed in the Los Angeles offices of architects Lloyd
Wright and Charles Eames before founding Rochlin &amp; Baran in 1952 with
Berkeley classmate Ephraim Baran.</TE>
<TE>   During the 34 years that he was an active partner, the firm became
known as a designer of medical facilities. Among the nearly 2,000
projects he helped shepherd were the UCLA Jonsson Cancer Research
Center and Northridge Hospital Medical Center. The firm also designed
structures for observatories.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, when he was 63, he announced his retirement in a letter
that quoted Yeats and Thoreau. "It takes the whole of a lifetime just
to learn how to live it," he told his colleagues. Then he rented a
small Santa Monica studio and spent the next several years designing
primitive toys, collapsible shelters and small architectural
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Retirement wasn't altogether comfortable. During that period he
would sometimes show up at his daughter's house, toolbox in hand,
looking for something to fix.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, a friend suggested that he take a workshop with
performance artist Spaulding Gray at Esalen Institute, the New Age
outpost in Big Sur. He and Harriet were among the small group
accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Gray drew out each participant's life stories, which they had to
present in the form of a monologue.</TE>
<TE>   All the harrowing war experiences he had spent decades trying to
forget came pouring out.</TE>
<TE>   "I just got up there and yapped away," Rochlin recalled in the
Chicago Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Los Angeles, he signed up for a class in solo performance
at Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica. He was the oldest
student by three or four decades. "He came in and I honestly didn't
understand what he was doing in class," said instructor Laurie
Lathem. "He was a nonactor, this old man."</TE>
<TE>   Then he read a story about one of his World War II experiences and
it "blew everyone away," Lathem said. "Everyone was in tears. I
hadn't been teaching long, but I did know that what we were hearing
was very special."</TE>
<TE>   Rochlin didn't believe her when she told him he had an
extraordinary talent for telling stories. But he was reluctant to
perform in front of others, sure that he could never memorize lines.
As a ruse to get him on stage, she constructed shows featuring
perhaps a dozen other people. She would put Rochlin on at the end.</TE>
<TE>   With Lathem's help, he prepared half a dozen vignettes and gave
his first show at Highways in early 1996. When the audience in the
packed house wasn't laughing, they were listening in hushed silence.
He earned a standing ovation, the first of many he would receive over
the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   He won an invitation to perform at the Actors Theatre of
Louisville. Then came the B Street Theatre and Weber's write-up in
the New York Times. "That was the clincher," Lathem said. "That's
when the world descended on Fred."</TE>
<TE>   He was invited to appear in Chicago, New York, New Hampshire and
St. Louis. In Southern California, he performed at the La Jolla
Playhouse, and at the Mark Taper Forum and Coronet Theater in Los
Angeles. He was fielding calls from book publishers and movie people.
Rochlin was delighted--and scared. "He wasn't looking for fame and
fortune--unlike everyone else in my workshop," Lathem said.</TE>
<TE>   What lured him to alternative theater?</TE>
<TE>   "I think one of the most generous things a person can do is share
themselves wholeheartedly with another person," Rochlin wrote in his
memoir. "How do you do that? You take off your mask and the mask
that's under that mask. You reveal yourself. You reveal yourself in
the stories you choose to tell. "</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife; daughters Judy, Davida and Margy; son
Michael; and three grandchildren.</TE>

Scholarship, Nogales High School/CCF, California Community
Foundation, 445 S. Figueroa St., Suite 3400, Los Angeles, CA

<TE>   `I Did What He Said. I Did My Best to Forget. I Thought I Was All
Right.'</TE>
<TE>   In this excerpt from "Old Man in a Baseball Cap" (HarperCollins,
1999), Fred Rochlin recounts a conversation with Capt. Connor, an Air
Force flight surgeon he knew during World War II. Rochlin, nicknamed
Rockets, was a navigator in a bomber squadron who assisted Connor in
an emergency C-section that saved the life of an Italian mother and
infant. The next day he took part in a bombing run that killed
thousands of innocent civilians. He was dousing his sorrow with a
drink in the officers club when Connor came in.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I said, "Connor, I'm feeling kinda weird. You know how you went
out last night and delivered that baby and I guess saved the mother's
life, and I helped. I was sort of proud of that. And then this
morning, we went out and I guess we killed about 2,500 to 3,000
people. And I helped. Connor, isn't this insanity? What's going on?"</TE>
<TE>   Connor looked at me and said, "How many missions you got,
Rockets?"</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen down, 35 to go."</TE>
<TE>   "You guys just make me sick. Here you've been bombing ... Europe
for 15 missions and you just catch on you're killing people.... You
want to be put in a straitjacket, booby hatch, Sectioned 8 out of the
Army?"</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   "Then you listen to me and do what I tell you to do because I'm
right. First, you follow orders and you do what you've been trained
to do.</TE>
<TE>   "Then just forget it. Forget it. And if you can't forget, then
pretend. Pretend. And if you can't pretend, then deny, deny, deny.
And that drink you're having, finish it and have another and another.</TE>
<TE>   "You do that, Rockets, and you'll be all right."</TE>
<TE>   Well, Connor was right. I did what he said, I did my best to
forget. I pretended. I denied and I sure ... did my share of drinking
and I was all right. I thought I was all right. Yeah! I was all
right.</TE>

<DH>Secession: Mayor collects more than $200,000 while warning
of dire consequences if the Valley and Hollywood split.</DH>

<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Collecting more than $200,000 for his anti-secession campaign, Mayor
James K. Hahn warned an influential audience Tuesday night that "Los
Angeles will lose its place on the world stage" if the San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood break away.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing a fund-raiser at the exclusive City Club downtown, Hahn
expressed anger at the twin secession measures on the Nov. 5 ballot
and the effect that secession would have on the nation's
second-largest city.</LD>
<LD>   He said businesses already are "taking a deep breath" on
investment in the city because of uncertainty about secession.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no question that breaking up Los Angeles slams the
brakes on the economy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor made his pointed remarks before an audience opposed to
secession, and representing a who's who of City Hall lobbyists,
contractors and commissioners, as well as business executives and
labor leaders, many of whom are dependent on the city government.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Assails Breakup Effort at Fund-Raiser</HD>
<DH>Secession: Mayor collects more than $200,000 while warning
of consequences if Valley and Hollywood split.</DH>

<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Collecting more than $200,000 for his anti-secession campaign, Mayor
James K. Hahn warned an influential audience Tuesday night that "Los
Angeles will lose its place on the world stage" if San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood break away.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing a fund-raiser at the exclusive City Club downtown, Hahn
expressed anger at the twin secession measures on the Nov. 5 ballot
and the effect that secession would have on the nation's
second-largest city.</LD>
<LD>   He said businesses already are "taking a deep breath" on
investment in the city because of uncertainty about secession.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no question that breaking up Los Angeles slams the
brakes on the economy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor made his pointed remarks before an audience opposed to
secession, and representing a who's who of City Hall lobbyists,
contractors and commissioners, as well as business executives and
labor leaders, many of whom are dependent on the city government.</TE>
<TE>   More than 125 people paid $1,000 for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres,
and some paid $10,000 or more for a private dinner with Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn thanked them "for all the checks you brought with you" and
said with their contributions his L.A. United campaign now has more
than $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The money will be used for a massive campaign to counter the claim
of secessionists that separate cities would mean lower taxes and
better services for residents.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to expose the lies," Hahn said. "We want to expose the
snake oil. We want to expose that the people are being sold a bill of
goods."</TE>
<TE>   He appealed to the crowd to use their connections to spread the
message against secession.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be crazy to break this city apart," Hahn said.
"It's a great city, a city of opportunity. It's on a roll ... I don't
want to lose that momentum."</TE>
<TE>   Among those in attendance were Airport Commission President Ted
Stein; Carol Schatz, head of the Central City Assn.; lobbyists Joe
Cerrell and Howard Sunkin; and labor leaders Julie Butcher and
Charley Mims.</TE>
<TE>   "You are an army that we need. We are going to build an even
bigger army," Hahn said, adding that the campaign will include
business, labor, religious leaders and "just folks."</TE>
<TE>   The amount raised at the event will not be disclosed until July
31. But another group fighting secession revealed its backers Tuesday
and challenged the secession group Valley VOTE to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   The group, One Los Angeles, has received more than a third of its
financial support from labor unions, with much of the remainder
coming from Valley residents and businesses, according to a donors'
list it released.</TE>
<TE>   The organization disclosed the names of the 115 donors, who have
given a total of $33,230, as a challenge to pro-secession Valley VOTE

<TE>   "Valley VOTE has steadfastly refused to reveal who is paying the

co-chairman of One Los Angeles. ''There may be no legal obligation to

<TE>   Valley VOTE and One Los Angeles say campaign finance disclosure

<TE>   The list released Tuesday showed that Daar and One Los Angeles
Co-Chairman Larry Levine, a political consultant, were the leading

<TE>   The Department of Water and Power Management Employees Assn.
contributed $3,000, and the Los Angeles Professional Managers Assn.,
Los Angeles Fire Chief Officers Assn. and Service Employee
International Union's Local 343 gave $2,500 each. The United Teachers
of Los Angeles contributed $1,787. Smaller donations came from unions
representing iron workers and laborers.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders say secession could leave Los Angeles city workers
unprotected once their contracts expire. Secessionists say the unions
would be free to negotiate new agreements with a Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   "This confirms the suspicion that this is just a front group for
labor unions," Close said of the labor contributors. "They are
opposed because their leadership is concerned that [it] will lose
power if there is a separate, smaller city."</TE>
<TE>   Levine said his group consists of Valley activists who merely
share an anti-secession philosophy with the unions.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Close denounced as "misleading" a private poll
released Tuesday that indicated most voters oppose Valley secession
when told of a breakup's potential "cost to taxpayers."</TE>
<TE>   The poll by Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin and Associates focused on
the so-called yearly alimony payment a Valley city would pay Los
Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Board's Secret Action Broke Law, Judge Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles judge ruled Tuesday that the Board of Supervisors
violated the state's open-meeting law when it directed its lawyer to
kill a proposed ballot initiative aimed at raising the wages of
workers who care for disabled people.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors gave the order during a closed session designated on
their agenda for debate over "initiation of litigation." Judge
Dzintra Janavs found that the board exceeded the limit of that topic
during its Dec. 18 meeting and in two follow-up executive sessions
during which supervisors dealt with fallout from the case.</LD>
<LD>   "It was beyond the agenda. It was an action that should not have
been taken in a closed meeting and it should have been reported" to
the public, Janavs said, ruling in a lawsuit brought by The Times.</LD>
<TE>   But Janavs declined to issue an injunction barring the county from
future violations. She said the newspaper's attorneys had proved only
the three instances that dealt with the initiative, not a lengthy
pattern of violations that would invite such an order. Nor did she
find that the county chief administrative officer's regular meetings
with individual supervisors the day before board meetings constituted
a violation of the open-meeting law, known as the Ralph M. Brown Act.</TE>
<TE>   Both county and media lawyers said the ruling pleased them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what we've been saying is repeatedly going on in closed
sessions," said Richard McKee, president of the California First
Amendment Coalition, a co-plaintiff in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney J. Kenneth Brown, representing the county in the case,
said Janavs had found only "minor" violations. "We consider it a
victory," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A Times study of a year of supervisors' agendas found that the
supervisors make more than 90% of their decisions without any public
input.</TE>

<HD>Treatment Ordered for Sex Crimes</HD>
<DH>Court: Jailed repeat offenders awaiting possible mental
hospital assignments require care, judge rules. L.A. County considers
appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Repeat sex offenders who have completed their prison terms must be
treated as patients rather than prisoners and be given mental health
treatment while they remain in jail, a Los Angeles judge ruled
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The order requiring the state to provide treatment applies to 203
convicts who are awaiting hearings to determine if they will be sent
to state mental hospitals under California's Sexually Violent
Predator Act.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for the sex offenders filed legal motions contending that
the state has acted unconstitutionally by housing the men in jails
rather than hospitals and by denying them treatment during the wait,
which sometimes takes years.</LD>
<TE>   California Department of Mental Health spokeswoman Nora Romero
said department officials disagree with Superior Court Judge David S.
Wesley's ruling and are consulting with the state attorney general's
office about an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The department does not believe that it has the responsibility to
treat the inmates when they are in county jails and has no immediate
plans to implement the order, Romero said.</TE>
<TE>   "This could conceivably mean setting up treatment programs in 58
counties and that was never the intent of the legislation," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The California Supreme Court ruled in 1999 that the sexual
predators law, enacted three years earlier, is constitutional but
should not be punitive and should not treat offenders as criminals.
Wesley, however, said in his ruling that the law has been applied
punitively in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of the detainees in the county of Los Angeles are
housed in jails, for a period of several years, without treatment,"
Wesley wrote in the 13-page ruling. "As the conditions of confinement
are similar to those of penal inmates, the SVPA, in its application,
is transformed into a penal law, due to the lengthy detention without
treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Wesley also directed the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
to keep those repeat sex offenders segregated from the general jail
population and to provide them with to those of inmates at Atascadero
State Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys filed motions in Superior Court earlier this year on
behalf of about a dozen inmates, but Wesley directed his order to
apply to all men who are involuntarily committed locally under the
sex predator law.</TE>
<TE>   The order directly affects only offenders in Los Angeles County,
but lawyers said it could prompt motions on behalf of men throughout
the state.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best thing that has happened to the SVP community in
a long, long time," said attorney Todd Melnik, who represents several
repeat sex offenders in Los Angeles County. "What Judge Wesley has
done is ensure that people detained under the Sexually Violent
Predator Act and housed in County Jail are patients, not inmates."</TE>
<TE>   Melnik originally had asked that his clients be placed in
hospitals rather than jails pending their hearings, but he said
Tuesday that he was very pleased with the order.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Mike Suzuki, who filed a motion on behalf
of a county jail inmate who had not received treatment since December
1998, said the ruling is just the first step.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to see if the County Jail can implement the judge's
ruling, and if they can't, where we would go from there," Suzuki
said.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant County Counsel Kevin Brazile, who represents the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department, said the county is considering
whether to challenge the order.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have to determine what impact the state mental health
treatment could have on jail operations, Brazile said.</TE>
<TE>   "The jail is not a state hospital," he said. "It's a jail, so
there are going to be safety and security concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Brazile added that repeat sex offenders already are segregated.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, repeat sex offenders are housed in County Jail
until a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to
believe that they may commit more sexually violent crimes. If
probable cause is found, the inmate is sent to Atascadero State
Hospital until his trial, which will determine whether he should be
committed to the state hospital for two years. For that to happen, at
least two state mental health experts must have found that the inmate
presents a "substantial danger" to society because he is likely to
attack again.</TE>
<TE>   The treatment program that repeat sex offenders receive at
Atascadero is intensive and long-term, and includes group and
individual therapy sessions, Mental Health Department spokeswoman
Romero said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just a psychiatrist or a psychologist that could go to
the jail for an hour once or twice a week," she said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Wesley, 76 Los Angeles County Jail inmates are
awaiting probable cause hearings. Most are not being treated and are
subject to the same restrictions and conditions imposed on penal
inmates; a few have been waiting since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The judge wrote that they may continue to be housed in County Jail
before their probable cause hearings, provided they get proper mental
health treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Wesley wrote that the Department of Mental Health must "implement
and enforce treatment to all persons detained with SVP status."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the offenders are in County Jail or anywhere else, Wesley
said, "treatment is the essential component of such commitment,
regardless of the stage of the civil process."</TE>

<HD>Trial Begins in Killing of Parks' Granddaughter</HD>
<DH>Crime: Samuel Shabazz is charged with murder of Lori
Gonzalez and nine attempted murders. A victim in one shooting waffles
on gunman's ID.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A teenager who police say was shot in the back by Crips street gang
member Samuel Shabazz retracted his identification in court Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Randy Robinson, 16, identified Shabazz while he was being treated
in a hospital after he was shot on a South Los Angeles street in
1998.</LD>
<LD>   But Robinson said Tuesday that he was heavily medicated at the
time and that was why he picked Shabazz out of a photo lineup.</LD>
<TE>   Moments later, he appeared to contradict himself, saying he picked
Shabazz because Shabazz was the shooter. The testimony came as
prosecutors opened their case against Shabazz, charged with nine
attempted murders and the murder of Lori Gonzalez, granddaughter of
former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks. Authorities often
cite the absence of witnesses as the most difficult problem in
successful prosecution of street gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz, 18, who appeared in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
allegedly was involved in four separate shootings in one day in
December 1998. The cases were consolidated over defense objections.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting of Gonzalez, considered a bystander, received
extensive publicity.</TE>
<TE>   She had bought fast food in Southwest Los Angeles with a friend,
Ernest Gray. She had driven through Popeye's Chicken and was waiting
for traffic to clear before pulling out of the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz allegedly walked up to the passenger side of her car,
looked at Gray, an alleged rival gang member, and raised a gun.</TE>
<TE>   "What Ernest Gray did then sealed Lori Gonzalez's fate," Deputy
Dist. Atty. Anthony Manzella told jurors. "Ernest Gray ducked."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, hit in the chest and head, was taken to Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center and died that night, May 28, 2000, just a week before
her 21st birthday.</TE>
<TE>   The West Boulevard Crips thought Gray had committed a drive-by
earlier that day, and responded by sending three carloads of their
members to the restaurant, Manzella said in his opening statement.</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz's attorney, Robin Yanes, said during his opening statement
that identity of his client was a key issue.</TE>
<TE>   Displaying two photographic lineups he said police used in their
investigation, Yanes asserted that his client was the only
dark-skinned man in either.</TE>
<TE>   Yanes said several witnesses failed to identify Shabazz, and Yanes
questioned the credibility of two who did. He said they cut deals
with prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Shabazz faces a sentence of life in prison without
the possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   Bobbie Parks, the former chief's wife, sat in the second row
during the proceedings, just behind Felicia Parks-Mena, Lori
Gonzalez's mother. Jose Gonzalez, the victim's father, and his wife
and children sat near Parks-Mena.</TE>
<TE>   During a break, Bobbie Parks said she planned to attend the entire
trial. "I'm just going to watch our justice system at work," Parks
said.</TE>

<HD>County's Head Start Chief Reassigned to Smaller Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The director of Los Angeles County's Head Start program, America's
largest, will be removed from his position and reassigned against his
wishes--a move that has upset parents and employees.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Kennedy, 52, took over Head Start 10 years ago, at a time
when the county's management and oversight were so slipshod that the
federal government, which provides all the funding, threatened to
strip the county of control. In the last decade, Kennedy stepped up
monitoring and helped to transform a $40-million program that served
7,900 children into a $200-million system that provides care and
preparation for school for nearly 25,000 children.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, the county's assistant
superintendent for educational services Elizabeth Sullivan wrote that
Kennedy will assume a new job coordinating the fledgling School
Readiness Initiative for infants and preschoolers, effective July 1.
That initiative has little of the budget and influence of the Head
Start operations.</LD>
<TE>   In the last two years, Sullivan has told Head Start employees that
the division needed restructuring and that Kennedy did not have
management skills. Sullivan requested assessments of the workplace
climate at Head Start by the U.S. Department of Justice; a federal
team there found Kennedy was "controlling and unwilling to share
power."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan's statement on Tuesday offered no explanation for the
change, but said Head Start in Los Angeles County "will chart a new
course" under an interim director, former Los Angeles Unified School
District Assistant Supt. Evangelina Stockwell. The statement noted
pointedly that at L.A. Unified, Stockwell served as leader of the
"office of intergroup relations." A county spokesman said Sullivan
and other county education officials would have no further comment.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Kennedy said he was gratified to be trusted with
a new assignment but did not understand the change. The program has a
fraction of the budget of the Head Start job, and Kennedy said he did
not seek the switch.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, with all of the accolades Head Start has
received," Kennedy said, "why would you move the director?"</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles County Office of Education, Kennedy was
responsible for one-third of the total budget and was sometimes
considered more powerful than his boss, the county superintendent of
education. And federal and state officials said he kept the county
operation clean of the questionable costs that have plagued Head
Start in other parts of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very good at working on expansion and getting different
agencies to work together and bringing parents into the governance of
Head Start," said Jerry Gomez, an associate director with the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services regional office in San
Francisco, which oversees Kennedy's work. "We're disappointed to see
Dr. Kennedy leave."</TE>
<TE>   His removal at a time when the Bush administration and Congress
are preparing to remake Head Start--and move it into the Department
of Education--"doesn't make sense," said Jaleh Hadian, executive
director of the Foundation for Early Childhood Education in El Monte,
one of the 30 local agencies that contract with the county to run
Head Start centers.</TE>
<TE>   Hadian, who emphasized that she was speaking for herself and not
for her agency, described Kennedy as "a visionary manager."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy is widely credited with persuading state and federal
officials to work together in drafting guidelines for assessing
children who come out of Head Start.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1965 as part of President Johnson's War on Poverty,
Head Start is designed to prepare poor children for kindergarten by
offering nutrition, dentistry, health care and socialization.</TE>

<HD>County Property Values Rise by $5 Billion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's property tax roll climbed 8% this fiscal year,
reflecting a still red-hot real estate market and a vibrant local
economy, Assessor Dan Goodwin said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Total assessed value of properties in the county reached $65.7
billion for fiscal 2002, ending June 30, a nearly $5-billion gain
over the previous fiscal year, he said. The roll exempts schools,
hospitals, churches and government-owned buildings.</LD>
<LD>   Goodwin attributed the increase to such factors as construction,
brisk home sales, high employment and an increasingly valuable real
estate market.</LD>
<TE>   "The housing appreciation cycle is continuing strong. And all
indications are it will continue that trend this year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The assessed value of property has increased about $5 billion
annually the past three years. The biggest percentage rise occurred
in 2000, when assessments grew 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara economist Mark Schniepp, director of California
Economic Forecast, said rising home prices and record sales are
powering the growth.</TE>
<TE>   The price of a typical Ventura County home jumped $49,000 in May
over the same month last year, pushing the median cost to $322,000. A
record 1,661 homes and condominiums were bought last month.</TE>
<TE>   "The peak was two years ago in terms of the economy, but the real
estate market has not peaked yet," Schniepp said.</TE>
<TE>   "The sales rate for the first five months of the year is running
at an all-time high. If that pace stays, 2002 will be an all-time
record high for sales. And prices are already at an all-time high."</TE>
<TE>   The largest slice of property tax revenue--55%--is funneled to
public schools. About 18% goes to the general fund to provide health
care, public safety and other services. Special districts and some
cities receive the remainder.</TE>

<HD>Anti-Syphilis Campaign Toned Down</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A smiling cartoon penis will star in a syphilis awareness campaign to
be unveiled this week in San Francisco to stem sharp increases in the
sexually transmitted disease among gay men.</LD>
<LD>   But the "Healthy Penis 2002" campaign--and its motto, "Making
every penis a healthy penis"--has been rejected in Los Angeles County
because health officials say it is too racy, demeaning to the gay
community and potentially offensive to others.</LD>
<LD>   In its place, the county and a coalition of community groups
launched a less explicit anti-syphilis campaign last week, using the
theme "Stop the Sores." Although the campaign doesn't feature a
penis, it has its own cartoon character, a fierce-looking red sore
nicknamed Phil. (Sores are one of the telltale signs of early
syphilis.)</LD>
<TE>   The dueling approaches by the state's two largest health
departments show how cultural differences between Northern and
Southern California surface even in safe-sex campaigns. San Francisco
often embraces the risque; Los Angeles tends to be more cautious.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you have a campaign talking about syphilis and not talk
about where the sores show up--on the penis?" said Steven Gibson,
program manager of Castroguys, a gay men's health project in San
Francisco. "Penis is not a vulgar word."</TE>
<TE>   Les Pappas, creative director of Better World Advertising, which
designed both "Healthy Penis" and "Stop the Sores," said Los Angeles
officials place a high importance on "not rocking the boat, on
protecting their jobs, avoiding controversy almost at any cost."</TE>
<TE>   "The result is that it's very hard, close to impossible, to do
really meaningful stuff, because it requires challenging the norms
and ... talking about sex in ways that will captivate people's
attention and interest and be relevant to them," Pappas said. "The
county has pretty much said that they can't handle that."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services
said the "Healthy Penis" theme stigmatized gay men. They also were
concerned that the campaign might offend people who are not gay.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided that, on balance, the likely benefit in terms of
reaching the population we're trying to reach didn't outweigh the
downside of those people that would find this objectionable," said
John Schunhoff, chief of public health operations for the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Concern About Gay Men</TE>
<TE>   Schunhoff also said that some officials feared that "the penis
actually sort of objectified gay men as penises, which was a
concern."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the county settled on Phil, a bumpy red creature with
silver shoes and an earring. The Los Angeles County campaign includes
ads in gay publications, 40,000 squeezable three-inch Phil toys and
two life-size mascots of the character that will make appearances
throughout Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles AIDS service groups say the county, which is spending
$394,000 on this syphilis campaign, is afraid to take chances. The
"Healthy Penis" proposal was endorsed by a coalition of six gay and
AIDS organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw this as an effective way to shock people into paying
attention, but it was also a very playful campaign and a very
positive campaign," said Terri Ford, director of prevention programs
for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles. "This campaign was
supposed to be driven by the community, and the community is not
getting what it wants."</TE>
<TE>   Ford also criticized the county for waiting eight months to
approve funding for the campaign after identifying syphilis awareness
as a priority last August. County officials acknowledge the wait was
too long.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, director of sexually transmitted disease
control in San Francisco, said his office favored the "Healthy Penis"
campaign, which will cost his agency about $50,000, because its
messages are "fun."</TE>
<TE>   "We clearly heard from the community that it's time to stop
focusing on negative aspects of health and start promoting healthy
behavior," Klausner said.</TE>
<TE>   Without mentioning Los Angeles County, he also criticized
government agencies that "don't listen to their communities and don't
respond to what the community is asking for."</TE>
<TE>   Even in San Francisco, however, not everyone is embracing the
cartoon penis image. Viacom Outdoor objected to using the penis image
on bus shelter advertisements, but has allowed the slogan "Healthy
Penis 2002" to appear in the ads that went up this week in five bus
shelters in the Castro area.</TE>
<TE>   "I just said, tone it down to what I felt would be acceptable to
the public in that area," said Patrick Roche, vice president and
regional manager for Viacom Outdoor.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco AIDS groups, meanwhile, have drawn scrutiny from
federal officials, some of whom think their promotions cross the line
of decency. At least one Bay Area group has been audited by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, and additional audits are
expected. Los Angeles hopes to avoid such scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Los Angeles health officials rejected a
billboard featuring a bare-chested man and the slogan "I believe in
sex" that was to be included in the "HIV Stops With Me" campaign.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco officials endorsed a federally funded television
commercial whose opening line, "I believe in sex," was uttered by a
shirtless model.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Leftgoff, 43, who was featured on the banned billboard, said
Los Angeles County "injected moral judgment into public health. They
have become responsible for increasing the risky behaviors that they
have been charged with helping reduce."</TE>
<TE>   Ad Called Inappropriate</TE>
<TE>   Charles Henry, director of the county's Office of AIDS Programs
and Policy, said the billboard did not meet federal standards and was
inappropriate for the neighborhoods in which it was slated to run.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not convinced that the 'I believe in sex' component was
sufficiently educational," he said. "I felt it was more titillating
than educating."</TE>
<TE>   Though syphilis is treatable with antibiotics, health officials
are worried because its sores greatly facilitate the spread of HIV.
Both Los Angeles and San Francisco have seen substantial increases in
syphilis cases, and both have been searching for solutions. As of
Friday, Los Angeles County had reported 209 early syphilis cases, of
which 122 were among gay or bisexual men. Cases are up 37% from last
year at this time. From January to May, San Francisco reported 180
cases of early syphilis, of which 141 were among gay or bisexual men.</TE>

<LD>Juan A. Vazquez, who has spent the last 27 years at the College of
Alameda in Northern California, has been named president of Santiago
Canyon College in Orange.</LD>
<LD>   The Rancho Santiago Community College District trustees appointed
him the college's third president at their board meeting Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Vazquez, who is interim president of the Alameda campus near
Oakland, will start Aug. 19. He will be paid $131,626 annually.</LD>
<TE>   Edward Hernandez, chancellor of the Rancho Santiago district, said
Vazquez is "ideally suited to the presidential role" at Santiago
Canyon. "He has a collegial and flexible approach to decision-making
combined with an authentic personality."</TE>
<TE>   Santiago Canyon started as a satellite campus of Santa Ana
College, then became an independent school in 1997 at a time of rapid
development in the hills east of Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Vazquez, 57, reached Tuesday at his office in Northern California,
said, "I am looking forward to my work with a great group of students
and staff at Santiago Canyon. And I'm looking forward to building a
new college."</TE>
<TE>   The son of a restaurant worker and a homemaker was reared in a
housing project in New York's Spanish Harlem. A brother and a sister
became college professors and another sister became a surgical nurse.</TE>
<TE>   Vazquez received his bachelor's degree in philosophy from City
University of New York and a master's degree as a reading specialist
from Cal State Fullerton, where he was also employed at the campus
Institute for Reading from 1973-74.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to the College of Alameda, where he was an English
teacher for two years before moving into campus administration. He
later became vice president of instruction and dean for business and
transportation programs.</TE>
<TE>   Vazquez said he has been looking around the state for openings as
a community college president, a position usually filled from
outside.</TE>
<TE>   Santiago Canyon has a student enrollment of about 12,785, which is
expected to reach 17,000 by 2010.</TE>

<HD>2 Say Mother Threw Them in Water</HD>
<DH>Courts: Trial begins for a Port Hueneme woman accused of
trying to drown her children in a harbor. Her son, 11, and daughter,
8, are among the first to testify.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She woke the children in the middle of the night and told them to get
dressed, saying only that they were going to wash their faces in the
harbor. They walked out and sat on the edge of a darkened boat dock.
And that is when it happened.</LD>
<LD>   "She just threw us in," said 8-year-old Harpreet Virk, describing
for a Ventura County jury Tuesday how her mother tried to drown her
and her 11-year-old brother, Sonny, more than two years ago in
Channel Islands Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   As the girl spoke, 42-year-old Narinder Virk of Port Hueneme, who
is charged with two counts of attempted murder and an allegation that
she caused serious injury to her daughter, cried softly from her seat
in the courtroom.</LD>
<TE>   Virk has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors
contend she deliberately pushed her son and daughter off a boat dock,
jumped in and held them underwater in an attempt to punish her
estranged spouse.</TE>
<TE>   But Virk's lawyer contends the Indian immigrant was a battered
wife who "snapped" on the night of Jan. 12, 2000, after her husband
boarded a plane to India, allegedly with plans to divorce her.</TE>
<TE>   Virk's trial got underway Tuesday in Ventura County Superior Court
and the children were among the first witnesses called to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Sonny told jurors that his mother woke him in the middle of the
night and led him and his sister from their apartment to the marina.
"She told me we were going to the harbor to wash our faces," he
testified. "Then she pushed us in."</TE>
<TE>   Sonny said he cried for help and tried to paddle away, but neither
he nor his sister knew how to swim. His cries were heard by marina
resident Brian Wiggins, a former lifeguard, who pulled the family
from the water as his wife, Angie, called 911.</TE>
<TE>   Virk and her children were taken to local hospitals, and Harpreet
spent a week in an intensive care unit after sustaining potentially
life-threatening injuries, witnesses testified. Virk was later
arrested and charged with attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   During the court proceedings, Virk wore a pale green chunni, a
traditional Punjabi scarf, draped over her head while she sat between
her lawyer and an interpreter. She looked at her children longingly
as they walked out of the courtroom. Barred by a protective court
order, Virk had not seen or spoken to her son or daughter in more
than two years.</TE>
<TE>   During opening statements, Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Simon
told jurors that evidence to be presented this week would show that
Virk deliberately tried to drown her children to punish her husband
after he walked out on the family.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said Virk left an audio tape for her husband, telling him
that when he returned from India he would only have the dogs to
feed--a remark the prosecutor contends indicates Virk's plan to kill
herself and the children.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also suggested that Virk, while she waited for treatment at
a hospital, instructed her son in Punjabi to lie to authorities,
instructing him to tell police officers that they went to the harbor
to wash pepper spray from their eyes after a burglar assaulted them.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Public Defender Cynthia Ellington argued that Virk was
so distraught that she could not have formed the intent to kill. She
told the jury that three medical experts would testify that Virk was
severely mentally disabled on the night of the incident as a result
of prolonged spousal abuse and cultural isolation.</TE>
<TE>   Virk, who is illiterate in her native Punjabi and speaks very
little English, was totally dependent on her husband and suffered a
break from reality when he abandoned the family, Ellington argued.</TE>
<TE>   She said the tape was not a suicide recording, but was made eight
months before the January incident and shows her client's crazed
mental state.</TE>
<TE>   Ellington did not deny that her client pushed her children into
the harbor. But twice during testimony she objected to Simon's
characterization of the incident as an attempted drowning.</TE>
<TE>   During the children's testimony, Simon asked them whether there
was domestic violence in the Virk home. Both children testified that
their parents argued, but they denied that their father beat their
mother. Instead, Sonny and Harpreet testified that their mother hit
them.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, Ellington tried to show that the children
were coached by law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   Virk's trial is expected to last about a week and would advance to
a second sanity phase if the jury convicts her. She remains free in
lieu of $500,000 bail, posted by a group of supporters. Testimony is
to resume today.</TE>

<HD>Limited John Wayne Expansion OKd</HD>
<DH>Aviation: The plan offers airlines more flights and
passengers. Supervisors would retain control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As many as 1.4 million more passengers will be able to use John Wayne
Airport each year starting Jan. 1 under an expansion plan approved
Tuesday by the Orange County Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   The decision extends a 1985 agreement that capped airport
expansion for 20 years, but the plan still includes flight
restrictions that are opposed by air carriers.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors and the city of Newport Beach hope that by permitting
a limited increase in traffic at the county's only airport they can
forestall lawsuits that could end the county's ability to regulate
the airport altogether.</LD>
<TE>   The plan approved Tuesday by the county, and also by the Newport
Beach City Council, would increase the number of loud jets using the
airport from 73 to 85 departures a day, as well as add four loading
gates within the terminal.</TE>
<TE>   The annual limit on passengers would rise to 9.8 million from 8.4
million beginning Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making significant concessions upfront to make everyone
understand that we want [them] to accept this," Supervisor Todd
Spitzer said of the unanimous vote.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Transport Assn., which represents the nation's largest
airlines, has insisted that all regulations at the airport expire at
the end of 2005, including noise limits and a curfew for commercial
jets.</TE>
<TE>   That position hasn't changed, association spokesman Roger Cohen
said Tuesday. Orange County voters' rejection in March of a proposed
new airport at the former El Toro Marine base makes the argument
greater for ending the limits at John Wayne Airport, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It underscores that Southern California needs more airport
capacity," Cohen said from the association's headquarters in
Washington. If airlines accept the county's continued control of the
airport, they will gain an immediate increase in flights and
passengers, Spitzer said. If they fight it, they will face years of
litigation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The county can restrict operations at John Wayne Airport because
its 1985 agreement predates a 1990 change in federal law. The
airlines agreed to replace loud jets with newer, quieter jets in
exchange for ending the authority of airport operators.</TE>
<TE>   The county and Newport Beach insist that they can extend the 1985
agreement, endorsed by a federal judge, without permission from the
airlines or the Federal Aviation Administration. The next step is to
draft a new airport "access plan" that will allocate the new flights
and gates.</TE>

<HD>County Cuts $39 Million From Social Services</HD>
<DH>Government: The Board of Supervisors approves the reduction
in a budget that's 4% bigger than last year's. Most agencies will
have to tighten belts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Expecting severe cuts in state funding, Orange County supervisors
Tuesday sliced $39 million from welfare-to-work programs, adoptions,
day care, job retraining and transportation for thousands of
low-income residents, with some cuts taking effect as early as
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The action came as supervisors approved a $4.9-billion budget for
the fiscal year beginning July 1, a budget 4% bigger than last
year's. However, it includes more than $57 million in cuts across
most county departments.</LD>
<LD>   Top county officials already had imposed a hiring freeze on most
departments in anticipation of reductions due to the state's
projected $24-billion deficit.</LD>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer asked the county's top welfare official
whether he had taken steps to inform welfare recipients of the cuts
to avoid confusion. Social Services Agency Director Larry Leaman
responded that it is too soon to tell the tens of thousands of
clients his office serves because the state has yet to finalize its
budget, and some programs could get relief.</TE>
<TE>   "It's evident that all our clients will be at risk because of the
cuts in services," Leaman said.</TE>
<TE>   Welfare officials could not estimate Tuesday how many people will
be affected. However, one official said that in the CalWORKS program
aimed at helping people get off welfare, more than 5,000 clients
could be affected.</TE>
<TE>   Social Services also is the portal for the county's Medi-Cal
population, which numbers 211,600 recipients, an agency spokesman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Social Services officials will have to centralize
its workforce and no longer will provide intake workers at local
hospitals, community medical clinics and family resource centers. So
although the county is not cutting benefits directly, it will be
limiting access as cuts result in case workers being pulled from the
field and from outreach programs, agency officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Some programs, such as the agency's car loan program, will end
Monday. Others, such as an after-school program for at-risk students,
will continue with reduced funding until they end in June 2003.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,600 schoolchildren throughout the county participate
in a CalWORKS after-school program that helps at-risk children with
tutoring, language skills, crime and gang prevention, said Ellin
Chariton, school and community services director for the Orange
County Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   But $1.4 million will be cut from the $4-million school program
this year, and it too will end in June 2003, Chariton said. It is too
early to tell how many children will be affected.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't told the school districts about the cuts yet," Chariton
said.</TE>
<TE>   The programs, for students in kindergarten through eighth grade,
are intended to help academic performance and to persuade students to
stay in school. Chariton said school administrators will have to seek
other sources of funding, possibly from the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Community Development Council in Garden Grove
were disheartened to learn their agency's CalWORKS program was being
cut. The council receives $151,000 to provide outreach services for
low-income and unemployed people in need of food stamps and other
services.</TE>
<TE>   The agency handles from 50 to 75 food stamp applications a month
and helped 11 poor families receive $10,000 in tax refunds last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The deal is these people would never have accessed these programs
had we not done the outreach," said Jerry Sanders, who supervises the
council's program. "That's 1,033 lives we've helped, and 90% of those
have never accessed the food stamp program before."</TE>
<TE>   Leaman said his agency may face a logjam as more people apply at
the main office because of the loss of outreach service areas.</TE>
<TE>   "This could cause a tremendous backlog," said Leaman, who in
addition to cutting $10 million in CalWORKS programs also had to cut
$29 million from other services.</TE>
<TE>   It could cause a major shift in the agency's character, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than being here to help people get the services they
deserve, we're not there to help but to process paper. It's a giant
step backward."</TE>

<HD>Fibers on Dead Girl Said to Match Suspect's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Fibers found on and near the body of Danielle van Dam are identical
to those seized from the home of David Westerfield, the neighbor
accused of kidnapping and murdering the 7-year-old, a police
department criminalist testified Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Shen testified that the orange and blue fibers found
wrapped around Danielle's necklace, in her hair, and near and on her
body were "similar in all the ways we could test them" to fibers
found on laundry and in the master bedroom at Westerfield's home.</LD>
<LD>   Under questioning from Deputy Dist. Atty. George "Woody" Clarke,
Shen said that it is "reasonable that the fibers came in contact with
the hair and necklace at or near the time of death."</LD>
<TE>   But under cross-examination from defense attorney Steve Feldman,
Shen said she cannot be certain that the fibers found on the dead
girl were from the same sources as those found in Westerfield's home.</TE>
<TE>   Shen's testimony came as the prosecution neared the end of its
case against Westerfield, 50, a self-employed design engineer who
lived two doors from the Van Dam family. He could face the death
penalty if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   James Watkins, a police computer expert, testified that
Westerfield kept a large collection of pictures of children in
sexually suggestive poses stored on computer disks on his home
computer.</TE>
<TE>   While Watkins was providing a 30-minute explanation of the
difference between a Zip disk and a compact disc, several jurors
began to nod off and were gently chided by Superior Court Judge
William Mudd.</TE>
<TE>   "I want everyone in the room to open those eyes," Mudd said.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle van Dam disappeared Feb. 2. Her body was discovered Feb.
27 in a rural area of the county 40 miles from her home. Westerfield
was arrested Feb. 22, after police investigators allegedly found her
blood, hair and fingerprints in Westerfield's home and recreational
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke had told jurors that dark hair was found clutched in
Danielle's hand. But Shen testified that the hair was that of
Danielle and not Westerfield.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments, Mudd banned Danielle's father, Damon, from
attending the trial after sheriff's deputies reported that he had
asked about how Westerfield is brought to court each day from jail.

<HD>Custody Decisions Biased Toward Men, NOW Says</HD>
<DH>Rights: Many women claim to have unjustly lost their
children. Fathers' advocates dispute conclusions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state's family court system is biased toward men in child custody
rulings, the California chapter of the National Organization for
Women said in a report released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 134-page report details the findings of a three-year study
based on questionnaires from women who say that they unjustly lost
custody of their children. The study found that women often were
denied custody even when children were abused by the father in part
because men often can afford better legal representation, said Helen
Grieco, California NOW executive director.</LD>
<LD>   Fathers' rights advocates disagreed Tuesday, saying that women
traditionally have been favored in family court. "The court
oftentimes still sees a 1950s vision of the family, where the mother
is the homemaker," said Dianna Thompson, executive director of the
American Coalition for Fathers' Rights in Lake Forest.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. census data showed that women are granted custody 80% of the
time, Thompson said. "Fathers have very small chances of getting even
dual custody," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson criticized the report's method as a self-selecting survey
among NOW constituents.</TE>
<TE>   NOW's conclusions were announced at a news conference after
attorneys for the organization filed a legal brief in a state
appellate court in Los Angeles supporting a mother who says that she
was denied a fair trial when a judge granted her ex-husband full
custody of their daughter, who is 15.</TE>
<TE>   Idelle Clarke, of Sierra Madre charges that a 1998 court decision
ordering Clarke's daughter to live with her ex-husband was based on
his allegation that Clarke brainwashed her daughter into saying that
he sexually abused her. Clarke said her daughter had told three
judges her father molested her.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke's struggle is common, Grieco said. She said the fathers'
rights movement during the 1980s created a backlash against women.
"We've been two steps behind, trying to do damage control," Grieco
said.</TE>
<TE>   The three-member appellate court panel is likely to decide the
Clarke case in about two months.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke said the last time she saw her daughter, it was from a
stage at the girl's eighth-grade graduation two years ago. "She was
wearing cargo pants and a battered T-shirt while everyone else was in
formal wear," Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke, who is representing herself in court, said she will appeal
to the state Supreme Court if she loses her appeal. "I'm a mother,"
she said. "I can't quit asking for help."</TE>
<TE>   Her ex-husband could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<LD>Oxnard Elementary School District trustees approved two new principal
assignments this week, after the sudden resignation of the principal
at Brekke Elementary School.</LD>
<LD>   Renee Ripps, principal at Haydock Intermediate School, will take
over at Brekke next month for Anthony Zubia, who quit June 17 after
30 years with the district.</LD>
<LD>   Supt. Richard Duarte would not comment on the circumstances
surrounding Zubia's departure, saying it is a personnel matter.</LD>
<TE>   Zubia, reached at his Oxnard home, said he resigned "for personal
reasons," and declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Duarte said Harrington Elementary Principal Francisco Barba will
take over at Haydock. Both appointments were made at a special
meeting of the school board Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   The district will advertise for the position at Harrington in
hopes of filling it by this fall, Duarte said. A retired principal
will take on the post temporarily, he said.</TE>

<LD>The Dina LaVigna Breath of Life Fund will hold its fourth annual
benefit triathlon-relay July 7 at Marina Park in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   The fund is dedicated to the memory of Dina LaVigna, who died in
1997 of primary immunodeficiency, an often fatal genetic disease that
afflicts mostly children. She was 33.</LD>
<LD>   LaVigna, who grew up in Camarillo, graduated from UCLA. Proceeds
from the triathlon will go to patient-care projects at the children's
hospital at UCLA Medical Center and Childrens Hospital Los Angeles,
where she was treated as a child.</LD>
